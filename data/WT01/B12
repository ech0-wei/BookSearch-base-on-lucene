</strong></font>Professional Compounding Pharmacy has been
producing &quot;custom made&quot; medications for over 45 years.
This pharmacy was originally founded by Donald K. Thompson in
1951 as the Nile Pharmacy in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Today the
Pharmacy is still a family owned business and is operated by
Donald&#146;s son Neil Thompson.<br>
<br>
In 1951 when Professional Compounding Pharmacy started, custom
compounding was an every-day practice. Pharmacists were trained
to tailor the Physician's prescribed medications to the needs of
individual's rendering these services. Now more then ever, people
are starting to appreciate and understand the importance of
having this type of service available to them. </p>

</strong></font><font size="3">The History of the Pharmacy and
Pharmacology dates back to the medieval times with priests, both
men and women, who ministered to the sick with religious rites as
well. Many peoples of the world continue the close association of
drugs, medicine, and religion or faith. Specialization first
occurred early in the 9th century in the civilized world around
Baghdad. It gradually spread to Europe as alchemy, eventually
evolving into chemistry as physicians began to abandon beliefs
that were not demonstrable in the physical world. Physicians
often both prepared and prescribed medicines; individual
pharmacists not only compounded prescriptions but manufactured
medicaments in bulk lots for general sale. Not until well into
the 19th century was the distinction between the pharmacist as a
compounder of medicines and the physician as a therapist
generally accepted.<br>

</strong><br>
phar·ma·cy (fär¹me-sê) noun<br>
plural phar·ma·cies<br>
Abbr. phar., Phar., pharm., Pharm.<br>
1. The art of preparing and dispensing drugs.<br>
2. A place where drugs are sold; a drugstore. In this sense, also
called apothecary.<br>
[Middle English farmacie, a purgative, from Old French, from
Medieval Latin pharmacìa, a medicine, from Greek pharmakeia, use
of drugs, from pharmakon, drug. <br>

the English Language, Third Edition copyright © 1992 by Houghton

<br>
<br>
The origin of the word &quot;pharmacy&quot; is generally ascribed
to the Greek pharmakon (&quot;remedy&quot;). It has been
suggested that there is a connection with the egyptian term
ph-ar-maki (&quot;bestower </font><img src="images/rxhist01.gif"
align="right" hspace="0" vspace="5" width="298" height="186"> <font
size="3">of security&quot;), which the god Thoth, patron of
physicians, conferred as approbation on a ferryman who had
managed a safe crossing. The notion of an Egyptian origin has a
certain romantic appeal, but in all likelihood the word
&quot;pharmacy&quot; and its many cognates derive, like so many
other scientific terms, from the Greek.<br>
<br>
As much as 80,000 years ago, people of the Paleolithic period
were interested in the flora around them to engrave a variety of
plants, bones and deer antlers. It is fruitless to try to
determine when Pharmaceutical practice started because Pharmacy
in a rudimentry form existed before the word.<br>
<br>
Combining different agents, or compounding, was considered an art
form practiced by Priests, and Doctors. The first known chemical
processes were carried out by the artisans of Mesopotamia, Egypt,
and China. Most of these craftspeople were employed in temples
and palaces, making luxury goods for priests and nobles. In the
temples, the priests especially had time to speculate on the
origin of the changes they saw in the world about them. Their
theories often involved magic, but they also developed
astronomical, mathematical, and cosmological ideas, which they
used in attempts to explain some of the changes that are now
considered chemical.</font><font size="4"><strong><br>

</strong>The first culture to consider these ideas scientifically
was that of the Greeks. From the time of Thales, about 600 BC,
Greek philosophers were making logical speculations about the
physical world rather than relying on myth to explain phenomena.
Thales himself assumed that all matter was derived from water,
which could solidify to earth or evaporate to air. His successors
expanded this theory into the idea that four elements composed
the world: earth, water, air, and fire. Democritus thought that
these elements were composed of atoms, minute particles moving in
a vacuum. Others, especially Aristotle, believed that the
elements formed a continuum of mass and therefore a vacuum could
not exist. The atomic idea quickly lost ground among the Greeks,
but it was never entirely forgotten. When it was revived during
the Renaissance, it formed the basis of modern atomic theory (see
Atom and Atomic Theory). <br>

modern pharmacist deals with complex pharmaceutical remedies far
different from the elixirs, spirits, and powders described in the
Pharmacopeia of London (1618) and the Pharmacopeia of Paris
(1639). In the U.S. today, major medicines, those regarded as
having the greatest therapeutic value, are selected for inclusion
in the Pharmacopeia of the United States, first published in
1820, by a Committee on Revision on which all colleges of
medicine and pharmacy, all state medical and pharmaceutical
associations, and the U.S. surgeon general are represented. After
the drugs have been chosen, the standards for quality and potency
are formulated by pharmacists and pharmaceutical chemists.
Similar criteria for drugs regarded by the committee as having
less therapeutic value are set forth in the National Formulary,
published by the American Pharmaceutical Association (founded
1852) since 1888. Any significant variation from pharmacopeia and
formulary standards may be prosecuted by the Food and Drug
Administration under the Pure Food and Drug Acts. <br>

Pharmacy, science of compounding and dispensing medication; also,
an establishment used for such purposes. Modern pharmaceutical
practice includes the dispensing, identification, selection, and
analysis of DRUGS. Pharmacy began to develop as a profession
separate from medicine in the 18th cent., and in 1821 the first
U.S. school of pharmacy was established in Philadelphia. <br>
<br>
Pharmacology (fär´me-kòl¹e-jê), study of the changes
produced in living animals by DRUGS, chemical substances used to
treat and diagnose disease. It is closely related to other
scientific disciplines, particularly BIOCHEMISTRY and PHYSIOLOGY.
Areas of pharmacologic research include mechanisms of drug
action, the use of drugs in treating disease, and drug-induced
side effects. <br>
<br>
Pharmacy, practice of compounding and dispensing drugs; also the
place where such medicinal products are prepared. Pharmacy is an
area of materia medica, that branch of medical science concerning
the sources, nature, properties, and preparation of drugs.
Pharmacists share with the chemical and medical profession
responsibility for discovering new drugs and synthesizing organic
compounds of therapeutic value. In addition, the community
pharmacist, or druggist, is increasingly called upon to give
advice in matters of health and hygiene.<br>
<br>

vspace="3" width="477" height="320"></font><font size="3">Education
and Practice <br>
In the U.S., colleges of pharmacy offer 5-year undergraduate
programs leading to the degree of bachelor of science in the
pharmaceutical sciences. All accept students directly from high
school and may grant advanced standing to college students or
graduates. Licenses are granted by states after the following
requirements have been met: graduation from one of the 72
colleges with programs accredited by the American Council on
Pharmaceutical Education; about 1500 hours of internship under a
registered pharmacist; satisfactory completion of a state
examination. Pharmacists may practice their profession in a
pharmacy located in a hospital, nursing home, or special area of
a drugstore. They may also be employed by a pharmaceutical
company in scientific research or the development and production
of new pharmaceutical products.<br>

size="3"><strong>EVOLUTION<br>
</strong>The rapid change from hand methods to machine methods of
production that characterized the Industrial Revolution found a
ready application in pharmacy, especially under the impact of the
scientific developments of the nineteenth century. Phytochemistry
and synthetic chemistry created new derivatives of old drugs and
new chemical entities of medicinal value that strained <img
src="images/rxhist3b.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="3"
width="474" height="300"></font><font size="3">the capacity of
the individual pharmacy. Large scale drug manufacturing had its
strong hold on society with the advent of machines and patents. <br>
The progress made by this new industry is demonstrated by the
catalogue of the American firm G.D. Searle, which by the late
1880&#146;s listed 400 fluid extracts, 150 elixirs, 100 syrups,
75 powdered extracts, and 25 tinctures and other drug forms.<br>

</strong>Industrialization had an impact on every aspect of the
activity of the pharmacist. First, it led to the creation of new
drugs, drugs that the individual pharmacist&#146;s own resources
could not produce. Second, many drugs that the individual
pharmacist was able to produce could be manufactured more
economically, and in superior quality, by industry. Third,
industry assumed responsibility traditionally vested in the
pharmacist for the quality of the medication. The plethora of
proprietary medicines, widely and often blatantly advertised,
deprived the pharmacist of a market for private specialties; it
forced the pharmacist to become a vendor of questionable
merchandise; it opened the way to much broader competition from
merchants, grocers and pitchmen than the pharmacist had
previously encountered.<br>

</strong>The nineteenth century did not see the end of the art of
compounding, but the art did give way, however grudgingly, to new
technology. It has been estimated that a &quot;broad knowledge of
compounding&quot; was still essential for 80 percent f the
prescriptions dispensed in the 1920s. <img
src="images/rxhist2b.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2"
width="499" height="479"></font><font size="3">Although
pharmacists increasingly relied on chemicals purchased from the
manufacturer to make up prescriptions, there still remained much
to be done secundum Artem. They spread their own plasters,
prepared pills (of aloes and myrrh or quinine and opium, for
example), prepared powders of all kinds, and made up confections,
conserves, medicated waters, and perfumes. They put up tinctures
(of laudanum, paregoric, and colchicum) in five gallon demijohns.
And they frequently combined into a single dosage from several
medicines, which normally today would be written and dispensed as
separate prescriptions. Further more, they were often called upon
to provide first aid and medicines for such common ailments as
burns, frostbite, colic, flesh wounds, poisoning, constipation,
and diarrhea. <br>
In addition to maintaining a prescription laboratory, pharmacists
usually carried the disliked but necessary patent and proprietary
remedies along with herbs and locally popular nostrums of their
own compounding.<br>

</strong>The most notable change in pharmacy in modern times has
been the virtual disappearance of the preparation and compounding
of medicines. Whereas in the 1920s, 80 percent of the
prescriptions filled in American pharmacies required a knowledge
of compounding, by the 1940s the number of prescriptions
requiring compounding had declined to 26 percent. As far back as
1971, only 1 percent, or less, of all prescriptions combined two
or more active ingredients. Moreover, the pharmacist&#146;s
commitment to maintaining the quality of the drugs dispensed has
been reduced to knowing such facts as the length of shelf life
and the effect of exposure to light and judging the reliability
and reputations of the manufacture. <br>
<img src="images/rxhist11b.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"
vspace="3" width="504" height="281"></font><font size="3">All
this meant that the pharmacist&#146;s education and activities
had to undergo change. At the same time that the scientific
education of pharmacists was steadily becoming more demanding,
their role in the provision of health care was becoming more and
more circumscribed. Moreover, they were increasingly subject to
government and institutional requirements that diminished the
importance of the patient-pharmacist relation. And, especially in
the United States and Great Britain, competition from
prescription departments in chain and department stores tended to
demean both the role and the dignity of the pharmacist as a
health-care professional. The urban blight that attacked the
neighborhoods was inevitably a threat to the friendly
neighborhood pharmacist.<br>
The reaction to these conditions was apparent in the drop in the
production of graduates of American schools of pharmacy who were
planning to go into the field of community pharmacy. In 1947,
about 90 percent of graduates planned to go into some aspect of
community pharmacy; in 1973, that figure had dropped to 76.6
percent; in 1988 it stood at <img src="images/rxhist7b.jpg"
align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="300" height="423"></font><font

</strong>Custom Compounding pharmacies are on the rise.
Physicians, medical institutions and patients are realizing more
then ever the importance of tailoring an individuals medications
to specifically meet there needs. A majority of the Pharmacists
that are going back to compounding are doing so for the love of
the science and interest in the patients well being. Being able
to be in the role of a problem solver opens the doors to
creativity and genius that the medical industry has been eagerly
adopting for the last decade. </font><font size="4"><strong><br>

        therapy by providing Pharmaceutical Care. While this term
        permeates the pharmacy literature, few others understand
        its implications. Pharmaceutical care involves far more
        than patient counseling. Specialized services may include
        such areas as <img src="images/beekers.jpg" align="right"
        hspace="0" width="200" height="280"></font><font size="3">
        asthma and allergy care, diabetes care, home health
        management, and human &amp; veterinary compounding.<br>
        Pharmaceutical compounding is the preparation of a
        customized medication dosage or dosage form to meet a
        specific patient need. Asthma programs involve
        elimination of asthma triggers and teaching the proper
        use of metered dose inhalers, peak flow meters, etc., as
        well as a complete medication history review. Diabetes
        care may involve self monitoring as well as education in
        areas of exercise and nutrition, often utilizing the
        expertise of individuals such as a Certified Diabetes
        Educator (CDE).<br>
        While the trend toward managed care tends to diminish the
        reality of specific patient needs, pharmaceutical care
        involves working on an individual basis with patient and
        physician to meet these unique needs, thereby improving
        the outcome of medical therapy. Interestingly, these
        interventions have also been shown to reduce overall
        healthcare costs. We welcome the opportunity to work with
        you and answer any questions.<br>

        Several clinical trials have shown that 4-aminopyridine
        may be helpful in treating one form of fatigue that
        occurs in multiple sclerosis. Fatigue is the single most
        common symptom experienced by people with MS, There are
        several types of fatigue that occur in multiple
        sclerosis. Four-AP appears to be particularly helpful in
        nerve fiber fatigue. In multiple sclerosis, the
        insulating myelin coverings of nerve fibers are destroyed
        leaving naked or demyelinated nerve fibers that are very
        sensitive to body temperature changes and fatigue easily.
        Because of nerve fiber fatigue, multiple sclerosis
        patients often notice that there is a limit to the
        distance they can walk or the time they can work with
        their hands. They also commonly notice worsening of their
        symptoms if they experience a fever, hot weather or as
        the day goes on. Demyelinated nerve fibers may work more
        efficiently and be less susceptible to fatigue when MS
        patients take 4-AP. Research on 4-AP demonstated that is
        improved function prone to nerve fiber fatigue in some MS
        patients. However, 4-AP does have side-effects such as
        dizziness, tingling sensations and in rare cases,
        seizures. It has been difficult to find the right dose
        since patients must take enough to have positive effects
        but not too much as it can cause seizures. Elan
        Pharmaceutical Company, which holds the marketing rights
        for this medication, is continuing to attempt to find the
        optimal dose. Though the Food and Drug Administration has
        not approved 4-AP for use in humans, 4-AP is available
        through several pharmacies in the United States.<br>

        Obesity is probably the most common chronic disease in
        our country. &quot;Obesity used to be viewed as a lack of
        willpower in a patient&#133; It was not viewed as a
        medical problem. Today I think it is,&quot; says Douglas
        Greene, a University of Michigan endocrinologist who
        heads an FDA committee of outside experts that studies
        new obesity drugs. Excess body fat increases the risk of
        hypertension, coronary artery disease,
        non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, <img
        src="images/beeker2.jpg" align="right" hspace="0"
        width="200" height="290"></font><font size="3">hypercholesterolemia,
        lower back pain, esophageal reflux, gallbladder disease,
        sleep apnea, gout, and certain types of cancer (e.g.
        prostate cancer). Patients with these medical conditions
        would benefit from a successful weight loss program.<br>
        Proper food choices (limiting fat) and regular aerobic
        exercises are preferable to calorie restriction as a
        method of weight loss, yet this approach is futile for
        the majority of people, two-thirds of whom regain all
        their lost weight after five years. In a letter to JAMA
        (1993; 270: 1423), Robert Yaes wrote, &quot;Certainly, at
        a time when it is fashionable to claim that alcoholism an
        d drug abuse are illnesses, whose treatment should be
        covered by health insurance, it is inconsistent to blame
        fat people for their own condition&#133; The majority of
        patients who enter weight-control programs do so because
        of concerns about their physical attractiveness, not
        their health. This perception could partially explain why
        so few physicians and so many charlatans are involved in
        the treatment of obesity.&quot; We would like to see this
        trend reversed. Outcome based weight management programs
        could eliminate the cause of many diseases, as opposed to
        treating the symptoms.<br>
        It is increasingly recognized that obesity is not a
        failure of will or behavior, nor is it a disorder of body
        weight regulation. It is a chronic medical condition.
        Research suggests that drug therapy may play an important
        role in long-term management. Robert Weintraub (see the
        &quot;Rx Capsules&quot; at the end of this editorial) has
        pointed out that if obesity is a chronic medical
        conditions in the same way that hypertension is, then
        weight gain following drug discontinuation is no
        different from blood pressure elevation after stopping
        antihypertensive medications.<br>
        In the 1970&#146;s, clinical investigators Richard and
        Judith Wurtman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
        had already implicated serotonin in eating disturbances.
        They theorized that dietary starch is converted to sugar;
        sugar stimulates the pancreas to release insulin; insulin
        raise tryptophan ( a precursor of serotonin) levels in
        the brain; serotonin regulates mood. In studies with
        obese women, Wurtman et al. Found that a
        high-carbohydrate snack improved mood. In support of this
        theory, weight loss is one of the side effects noted with
        the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetinbe (Prozac).
        Boosting serotonin seems to reduce carbohydrate craving
        and helps patients feel &quot;full.&quot; If mood swings
        are eliminated, perhaps behavior modification can be more
        effective. <br>
        Dean Ornish, a California doctor leading a crusade to
        treat heart disease through diet and lifestyle change,
        disputes the premise that a serotonin imbalance is at the
        root of obesity. His clinical work suggests that a diet
        with only 10% of calories form fat is extremely effective
        in losing weight and keeping it off.<br>
        In patients for whom nutritional therapy has not worked,
        the physician may want to consider customized drug
        therapy. As pharmacists, we feel that it is important for
        physicians to have control over their patients&#146;
        therapy. Through the use of professional compounding, we
        can work with you to individualize each patients&#146;
        therapy and maximize the therapeutic benefit. Please call
        for more information. &quot;We help doctors to solve
        medicaiton problems.&quot; - </font>Patty Story - Editor

        weeks of drug or placebo therapy, along with calorie
        restriction, behavior modification, and exercise,
        patients in the treated group had lost an average of
        15.9% of initial weight, compared with an average loss of
        5.9% in the placebo group. Of significance is that those

        Drug treatment can play an important role in any

        when working with physicians who were treating pain of
        various origins. The physicians had found that patients
        with long-term chronic pain, including myofacial pain,
        had extraordinary response to topical non-steroidals
        prepared by a compounding pharmacist. Pain at multiple
        trigger points responded extremely well to a combination
        of ketoprofen and capsalcin.<br>
        When using this therapy for industrial injury patients
        and in those chronic back pain, I have experienced no
        failures. The typical starting dose of topical ketoprofen
        10% PLO (pluronic organic lecithin) gel is 1 cc applied
        to the affected area every six hours. The dosage is
        titrated to patient response. Ketoprofen PLO gel has been
        very helpful and I am extremely enthusiastic about
        it&#146;s potential with other patients.<br>
        A definite advantage of topical therapy is area-specific
        targeting of the active ingredient to obtain high tissue
        levels. Topical absorption means a lack of GI side
        effects. Also, low or undetectable blood levels avoid the
        need for dosage adjustment and the potential for problems
        with hepatic and renal impairment.<br>
        Editor&#146;s note: Please see the abstract in our
        previous edition regarding transdermal drug transport.
        Proper preparation of this gel involves significant
        physical agitation in order to increase micelle formation
        and ensure efficacy. (Micelles are spaghetti-like
        structures that produce a macroscopic viscosity,
        increasing the transdermal penetration of the gel.)
        Appropriate agitation requires the use of an ointment
        mill or other homogenization process which we use in our
        compounding laboratory.<br>

        The basic ingredient in our ability to provide customized
        care and medications is our commitment to quality
        service. The type of service that is most appropriate for
        each individual is best determined by working within the
        &quot;triad&quot;- that &quot;all important&quot;
        patient-physician-pharmacist relationship.<br>
        Service can mean the difference between therapeutic
        success and failure, or the ability to provide the
        medication that will be most efficacious instead of
        having to use a sub-optimum preparation for lack of a
        better alternative. <img src="images/vent2.jpg"

        &quot;Customized medications to meet each patient&#146;s
        specific need.&quot; We can compound a formulation that
        contains the precise dose of active ingredients which
        will be most effective, in a dosage form that can be
        conveniently administered, well-tolerated, and properly
        flavored. We can avoid the use of offensive excipients
        such as alcohol, dyes, lactose, or preservatives.<br>
        Our state of the art equipment and specialized training
        allows us to compound medications that are tailored to
        the needs of each patient. Examples are slow-release
        dosage forms titrated to individual response and
        concentrated medications in a base that will enhance
        bioavailability. Our technique and knowledge, combined
        with our desire to provide the best possible care by
        working with each patient and physician is what makes the
        difference. We welcome the opportunity to answer your
        questions and to work with you and your patients.<br>

        Absorption through the skin is currently regarded as an
        important alternative to traditional methods of drug
        delivery. Lecithin gels have many properties which make
        them a desirable vehicle: they can be obtained with
        biocompatible components, are stable for a long time, and
        can solubilize sizeable amounts of quite different
        chemicals. The proposed mechanism of transport is an
        interaction between the layers of lipids in the stratum
        corneum and the phospholipids of the gel. Journal of
        Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol. 81, No. 9, Sept 1992, pp.
        871-4<br>
        reports effective transport of scopolamine and broxaterol
        (a bronchodilator), and the authors concluded with
        &quot;&#133;studies in our laboratory show that various
        other substances, such as estradiol, amino acids, and
        peptides, can be transported transdermally via lecithin
        gels. These results suggest that there are no great
        restrictions on the chemical structure of the drug.&quot;
        &quot;NATURAL PROGED. Discusses the use of natural
        progesterone in treating osteoporosis and PMS, as well as
        fibroid tumors, mild to moderate endometriosis,
        fibrocystic breast disease, and cervical erosions or
        dysplasia. To reverse osteoporosis, Dr. Lee prescribes
        natural progesterone cream, a diet rich n vegetable and
        grains to serve as a source of calcium and magnesium for
        bone mineralization, mineral and vitamin supplements, and
        modest exercise. <br>

        Right Medication in the Right Doses</strong></font><br>
        <strong>by Gene Lawrence, M.D., Obstetrics and
        Gynecology, Newport Beach, CA</strong><br>
        All physicians, gynecologists in particular, encounter
        patients frustrated by recurrent bacterial vaginosis. A
        recent case had an Enterococcus which was resistant to
        clindamycin, sulfonamides, and metronidazole. The simple
        solution was seven days of ampicillin vaginal
        suppositories compounded by my local &quot;problem
        solving specialist&quot;. Although the underlying
        pathophysiology varies from patient to patient, an
        alkaline vagina is commonly the problem. An acidic vagina
        can usually be achieved by daily utilization of 600 mg
        boric acid suppositories for thirty days. If lactobacilli
        are not found on a follow-up culture, the boric acid
        suppositories should be continued.
        <p><font size="4"><em>Editor&#146;s Footnote<br>
        </em></font>The suppository is a practical alternative
        for infants or severely debilitated patients who cannot
        take oral medication and for whom the parental route is
        unsuitable. Suppositories have been used for several
        thousand years and are referred to in the ancient
        writings of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Early
        suppositories consisted of cloth, plants, wood or other
        material used plain or soaked in a solution of
        &quot;medication&quot; prior to administration. Today, a
        suppository is generally made from a fatty acid base
        consisting of palm and coconut oils or a water soluble
        base consisting of polyethylene glycol. Desirable
        characteristics of a good suppository include: it is
        stable, non-irritating, compatible with a variety of
        drugs, aesthetically acceptable, and melts or dissolves
        in various body fluids. Generally, a correctly compounded
        vaginal or rectal suppository can quickly and easily
        deliver up to 600 mg of active drug. Suppositories can be
        used to treat local conditions such as hemorrhoids or
        infection, or systemic problems such as nausea, pain or
        inflammation. In conclusion, the suppository is very
        useful in treating a variety of medical conditions and
        the physician will benefit from adding this alternative
        dosage form to his armamentarium. </p>

        keynote speakers at a recent anti-aging conference in Las

        <img src="images/triam.gif" align="bottom" vspace="2"

        The FDA and National Association of State Boards of
        Pharmacy agree, and allow more latitude to all parties
        when this triad is intact. This triad has always been the
        basis of the profession of pharmacy. Each year- as the
        rate of development of new medications and therapeutic
        and diagnostic technologies accelerates, the
        physician-pharmacist-patient relationship becomes more
        significant to each of its members. Health care providers
        are seeing more patients each day. Patients are being
        forced to become more involved in their own healthcare.
        Physicians and pharmacists working together with the
        patient can provide the necessary supervision. When
        everyone places the care and well-being of the patient
        foremost, this triad is extremely effective. Utilizing
        available resources and the professional expertise of
        other members of the health care team strengthens the
        ability of the triad to provide optimal patient care. Our
        pharmacists have been specially trained to deal with
        patient care issues. We welcome the opportunity to work
        with you.</font><font size="5"><strong> </strong></font>Patty

        MIGRAINE - </strong></font><font size="3">In an open
        multicentre study in Switzerland, dihydroergotamine nasal
        spray was studied for its efficacy and tolerability in
        the treatment of acute migraine attacks (common and
        classical migraine-one attack per patient) in a total of
        904 patients. In the global assessment, 76.8% of all the
        patients reported good efficacy (freedom from pain, less
        pain or shorter duration of pain). When the nasal spray
        was used in the prodomal phase, good efficacy could be
        obtained by 90 (63%) of 143 patients. 18.1% of all the
        patients treated- more frequently those who obtained no
        beneficial effect and /or who took additional medication
        during the migraine attack- reported one or more minor
        side effects such as local nasal irritation, nausea,
        dizziness and vomiting. Contact your

        Right Medication in the Right Doses</strong></font><br>
        <strong>by Gene Lawrence, M.D., Obstetrics and
        Gynecology, Newport Beach, CA</strong><br>
        All physicians, gynecologists in particular, encounter
        patients frustrated by recurrent bacterial vaginosis. A
        recent case had an Enterococcus which was resistant to
        clindamycin, sulfonamides, and metronidazole. The simple
        solution was seven days of ampicillin vaginal
        suppositories compounded by my local &quot;problem
        solving specialist&quot;. Although the underlying
        pathophysiology varies from patient to patient, an
        alkaline vagina is commonly the problem. An acidic vagina
        can usually be achieved by daily utilization of 600 mg
        boric acid suppositories for thirty days. If lactobacilli
        are not found on a follow-up culture, the boric acid
        suppositories should be continued.
        <p><font size="4"><em>Editor&#146;s Footnote<br>
        </em></font>The suppository is a practical alternative
        for infants or severely debilitated patients who cannot
        take oral medication and for whom the parental route is
        unsuitable. Suppositories have been used for several
        thousand years and are referred to in the ancient
        writings of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Early
        suppositories consisted of cloth, plants, wood or other
        material used plain or soaked in a solution of
        &quot;medication&quot; prior to administration. Today, a
        suppository is generally made from a fatty acid base
        consisting of palm and coconut oils or a water soluble
        base consisting of polyethylene glycol. Desirable
        characteristics of a good suppository include: it is
        stable, non-irritating, compatible with a variety of
        drugs, aesthetically acceptable, and melts or dissolves
        in various body fluids. Generally, a correctly compounded
        vaginal or rectal suppository can quickly and easily
        deliver up to 600 mg of active drug. Suppositories can be
        used to treat local conditions such as hemorrhoids or
        infection, or systemic problems such as nausea, pain or
        inflammation. In conclusion, the suppository is very
        useful in treating a variety of medical conditions and
        the physician will benefit from adding this alternative
        dosage form to his armamentarium. </p>

</strong></font>Four separate multi-center, double-blind clinical 
trials in the UK have shown that the efficacy of a 
topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug is equal 
to that of oral medication in treatment of soft tissue 
injuries and mild to moderate osteoarthritis. The 
advantage? Plasma concentrations remain low after 
topical application, significantly reducing the 
incidence of GI side effects. The British Medical 
Journal (1995;311:22-6) reports that a post 
marketing study of 23,590 patients using a topical 
NSAID showed only 6 cases of adverse GI events 
that were &quot;definitely&quot; or &quot;probably&quot; related to topical 
NSAID use. Another study of 1103 patients 
demonstrated no significant association between 
topical NSAID therapy and upper GI bleeding and 
perforation. Contact your &quot;problem-solving&quot; 
pharmacist for more information.<br>
<font size=5><strong>DHEA-</strong></font>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a 
steroid produced by the adrenal cortex. DHEA 
levels decline with progressive age. A 1994 study 
demonstrated a higher concentration of insulin 
growth factor (IGF) in the subjects receiving DHEA, 
an indication of increased growth hormone release. 
Patients receiving small daily doses of DHEA have 
shown improved ability to cope, increased mobility, 
less joint discomfort and sounder sleep. Although its 
biologic role is still undefined, itmay prove to be a 
key in slowing the aging process. Additional 
information is available upon request.<br>
<font size=5><strong>TRANSDERM 
SCOP-WHERE ARE YOU?-</strong></font> 
The latest word from CIBA Pharmaceuticals is that 
the patch will not be available until mid 1996, due to 
a production problem discovered by their quality 
managemnet team during a test run. A representative 
from CIBA stated that the difficulty was a &quot;variance&quot;, 
but would not elaborate as to whether the variance 
referred to delivery rate, blood levels or some other 
factor. Contact our compounding pharmacy for

Onychomycosis</strong></font><br>
by Bruce Berger, M.D., Dermatologist, Princeton, 
NJ<br>
Traditional therapy for fungal infection of the nail has 
required prolonged therapy with oral griseofulvin, 
and often surgical excision of the nail. Commercially 
available topical creams are ineffective. Oral 
itraconazole has just been approved by the FDA. 
Although more effective than griseofulvin, it still must 
be taken for three months, and the recommended 
dose of two capsules daily is estimated to cost over 
$350 per month. Both oral agents have the potential 
for several serious drug interactions with Seldane, 
Hismanal, Propulsid, Versed, Halcion, and other 
medications. <br>
I have found an effective alternative. This therapy is a 
good selection for patients who can not tolerate the 
oral agents, or those who wish to avoid the potential 
for drug interactions. Itraconazole or fluconazole can 
be placed in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) base, and 
applied topically to the affected nail. DMSO has 
been well-documented as a penetrant-enhancer with 
various other medications, and is key to the success 
of this therapy. I have used these specially 
compounded products in many patients with 
cnychomycosis and have achieved excellent results.<hr>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MOTHER OF HORMONES </H2>

<P>   DHEA is called the mother of hormones by researchers because it is used by the body to manufacture many other hormones, including our sex hormones that are necessary for many bodily functions. Some of these are well known, such as estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, cortisone and others. They are responsible for the maintenance of many bodily functions such as fat and mineral metabolism, controlling stress, maintaining male and female characteristics and others. The body produces DHEA and then converts it on demand to these other hormones. In addition, we now know that each of our cells also have DHEA receptors, meaning that DHEA has its own effects as well.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING</H2>
<P>   This wonderful substance is abundant in our bodies when we are about 20 years old but continues to decrease with time. At 80 years of age, we usually only produce about 10 to 20% of the amounts when we were in our 20's. Interestingly, the steady declining levels of DHEA in our blood stream as we age perfectly matches the increasing incidence of the killer diseases cancer, heart disease (including atherosclerosis) and Alzheimer's disease.</P>
<P>  Much research has shown the major importance of DHEA levels in the prevention of these kinds of disease.   For example, a 1988 study at Johns Hopkins showed 50% reduction in arterial plaque in rabbits. A Temple University study showed supplemental DHEA was able to prevent breast cancer in mice that were prone to develop it. The studies also showed the prevention of lung and bowel tumors plus the extension of life span. A study in Guernsey, U.K. showed women destined to develop breast cancer had low DHEA levels up to nine years previous.  Doctors at the Medical College of Virginia showed lower DHEA levels were associated with build-up of atherosclerotic plaque and that higher  insulin  levels  from  the  ingestion  of  simple carbohydrates caused a reduction of DHEA levels in the body. Maintaining DHEA levels in the body has been shown to be important in improving memory, preventing Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis in post-menopausal women.</P>
<P>   A twelve year study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1986 (315.1519-24) reported that of the 242 men aged 50-79 studied: "A I00 microgram per deciliter increase in DHEA sulfate concentration corresponded with a 48% reduction in mortality due to cardiovascular disease and a 36% reduction in mortality for any reason. The natural level of DHEA sulfate was measured and those individuals with higher DHEA sulfate levels lived longer and had much lower risk of heart disease."</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WEIGHT CONTROL</H2>
<P>   One of the most exciting benefits of DHEA is its ability to burn fat and help keep it off by converting fat to muscle. It is a "thermogenic" substance because it helps burn calories for energy rather than store them as fat.</P>

<P>   Dr. A. Schwartz, a researcher at Temple University, has now proven beyond question DHEA's effectiveness in weight control.  DHEA's ability to block an enzyme named G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase) may be one of the most significant finds of the century.  This enzyme is not only essential for fat tissue production but also promotes cancer cell growth. By blocking it, DHEA's action of reducing body fat and helping to prevent against cancer may be explained. DHEA's weight control effect does not seem to be so diet dependent. No matter what you eat, DHEA still has benefits of weight loss. Of course, dietary modification, exercise and lifestyle are important in weight control but it is exciting to obtain benefits of such a fantastic natural substance at whatever level of commitment you want to make.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE FORMULATION</H2>
<P>   DHEA has probably become the most extensively studied substance in recent history. This is because it plays such an important role in metabolism and can have such an amazing positive effect when used as a specialized supplement. DHEA is a much needed substance to maintain youthful vigor, a lean body and many other desirable traits.  Our endocrine (hormonal) system is virtually dependent on adequate levels of DHEA, but unfortunately levels decrease as we age. Many researchers believe that decreasing levels of DHEA contribute to symptoms normally associated with aging as well as many degenerative conditions such as cancer and atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries.</P>

<P> ENDOCRYN DHEA not only contains a full 30 mg of the prohormone DHEA, but also 10 mg of a high quality Phytosterol Complex that also serves as fuel for the endocrine system. The herbal concentrates, amino acids, pantothenic acid and magnesium nutritionally support adrenal function for optimum health.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  ENDOCRYN DHEA is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE IT</H2>
<P>  As a natural DHEA supplement for general use, it is usually recommended to take one tablet from one to three times a day.  Larger individuals, or those desiring a more aggressive approach, may take more for a month or two. The goal is to provide your body with the DHEA and nutritional materials to support your adrenal glands so they can produce and maintain healthy DHEA levels.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HISTORY </H2>
<P>In 1928, Albert Szent-Gyorgyi isolated vitamin C from citrus and other sources. It helped prevent scurvy, but results were not consistent. He later isolated bioflavonoids, which he called vitamin P. He blended the two together and called the mixture "citrin."  This mixture was more reliable but still inconsistent.</P>
 <P>   Then in 1947, Professor Dr. Jack Masquelier, working at the University of Bordeaux began solving the puzzle.  The French government asked him to research the possible toxicity of the red pigment in peanut skins. The agricultural authorities wanted to know if the residue from peanuts being fed to livestock was toxic because some of the animals did not like to eat it.   He showed the red substance was not toxic and while studying it, isolated the first proanthocyanidins or OPC's ever identified. As a matter of fact, his Ph.D. thesis was about this research.  It shed light on the colorless OPC's that had a vascular protective effect greater than Szent-Gorgyi's citrin. The OPC's were different from the yellow colored bioflavonoids isolated earlier.</P>
<P>    In  1948 and in  1951, Masquelier registered his first patents. They described his method of extracting OPC's from peanut skins and pine bark.  In later patents, Masquelier described methods to obtain OPC's from grape seeds. Most importantly, his 1987 U.S. Patent No, 4,698,360 granted the exclusive right to use OPC's as antioxidants to protect the body "against the harmful biological effects of free radicals."</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TERMINOLOGY</H2>
<P>    Dr. Masquelier's extract contains individual units called catechins. The catechins, which occur individually, are called monomers. When they are linked together in pairs, they are called "dimers" and when in three's, "trimers." In 1979, he named the mixture "pycnogenols" from the Greek "pycno" meaning to "thicken or condense," "gen" meaning "to generate " and "ol" from their chemical name.</P>
<P>   The dimers and trimers are referred to as oligomeric proanthocyanidins.  "Oligo" is from the Greek meaning "a few" or "more than one but not many. " "Pro " means "before," "precursor" or "produces," and "anthoCyanins" are the red compounds that the proanthocyanidins change into when fruit ripens, flowers mature or leaves turn.</P>
<P>    "Oligomeric ProanthoCyanidins'' is abbreviated "OPC," They are found in most plants, are highly bioavailable and are active in the body as tremendous antioxidants and free radical scavengers. OPC's are chemically classified as flavanols and are present in red wines, flowers, leaves, fruits, berries, nuts, sorghum, beans and hops with high concentrations in skins, barks and seeds. The most feasible commercial source is the seeds of grapes and the bark of the French Maritime Pine.</P>
 <P>   Technically speaking according to Masquelier, OPC's are really not bioflavonoids.   OPC's are "flavonols" while bioflavonoids are "favonoids." While the chemical structure of their core molecules is the same, flavonols and flavonoids actually have more differences than similarities. OPC's are colorless, bioflavonoids are yellow. OPC's are water soluble, bioflavonoids are relatively insoluble.  Flavanols, including OPC's, are always made up of polymers of one compound called "flavan-3-ol", while bioflavonoids are made up of many different compounds with a "flavane" nucleus.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FORMULATION</H2>
 <P>  All  Life  Plus  PROANTHENOLS  products  are formulated exclusively with Dr, Masquelier's OPC-85, a scientific blend of extracts including grape seeds and French Maritime Pine Bark, under protection of U.S. Patent No. 4,698,360, assuring today's standard of excellence in proanthocyanidins. Up to 25% of OPC extract consists of monomeric precursors, the building blocks of OPC. In grape seed extract, these precursors are known as catechins and epicatechins. Pine bark extract contains catechins and taxifolin. Every plant species has its own unique precursor mix. Blending both grape seed and pine bark extracts combines all their monomeric precursors. The two together provide a broad spectrum, creating a more complete storehouse of OPC building blocks. On their own, these precursors are inactive and short lived. However, catalyzed by the presence of OPC, they become active and "unfurl" their own unique biological benefits rendering the blend richer in total activity.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANTS</H2>
<P>    Free radicals are incredibly destructive. They damage our cells, which can mean premature aging, reduced immune function, inflammation and ultimately degenerative disease. Our primary defense is antioxidant nutrients, of which the most well known are vitamins C and E. The biological activity of antioxidants is enormously important to our health. OPC's, or proanthocyanidins are the most powerful antioxidant free radical scavengers known to man.  They are as much as 50 times more potent than vitamin F and 20 times more than vitamin C. OPC's are major protectors of collagen, the basic foundation our blood vessels and all connective tissues such as skin, ligaments around joints and tendons.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>   All  PROANTHENOLS products are formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme tablet base.  PhytoZyme base is a unique combination of concentrates containing numerous phytonutrients from over thirty different plants. When you take Life Plus products, you receive the added benefit of many natural  phytochemicals.    Each  formula  contains  these synergistic  nutrients  for  the  natural  health  supporting phytonutrients and other micronutrients they contain.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUGGESTED USE</H2>
<P>    Most individuals take 1 mg of OPC's per pound of body weight per day. For example, a 100 lb person would take 100 mg per day. This equals one HP 100 mg tablet or two Regular 50 mg tablets. Most take more the first week. Children and adults under 100 lbs take 100 mg per day. The HP formula is the most cost effective and convenient.  It is common to take more for specific needs.</P>



 
<P>Suggested Use:  Usually one mg. of pycnogenol per pound of body weight per day for seven days, 
thereafter 50 mg per day.</P>

<H2>COLLOIDAL SILVER </H2> 
 <P>COLLOIDAL SILVER is an amazing natural alternative to antibiotics. <B>There is no disease causing bacteria that can live in the presence of even minute traces of metallic silver.</B>Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER contains only aural ingredients that help the body fight infections just like synthetic antibiotics, but without their damaging side effects. Its natural light golden color is characteristic of its high quality. The concentration of five parts of silver per million contained Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER is the most effective, safe formulation available. Higher concentrations can actually be less effective as they may interfere with beneficial bacteria and cause skin discoloration, even when used internally. Every family desiring optimum natural health should have a bottle of Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER in the medicine cabinet.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>QUALITY</H2>
<P>The Life Plus top grade COLLOIDAL SILVER is produced by a highly technical electrocolloidal method employing an electrical current. It has a pH of approximately 6.5 and is a natural golden color. Usually, an antibiotic kills a half dozen or so bacteria, but silver kills some 650. Resistant strains do not develop to silver like they do with antibiotics.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>HISTORY</H2>
<P>Silver was used as a proven germ fighter in the early 1900's. It was the mainstay of antibiotic treatment, and today's technology is even more superior. The medical journal <I>Lancet</I> reported phenomenal results from colloidal silver in 1914. Dr. Henry Crooks showed colloidal silver to be highly germicidal yet absolutely harmless and non-toxic to humans. Colloidal Silver has been proven useful against all species of fungi, bacteria, protozoa, parasites and certain viruses, which are often killed within minutes. L>C> For, M>D> at the UCLA School of Medicine reported in 1988 that silver solutions were effective against Streptococcus, Pyogenes, Staphylococcus Aures, Neisseria Gonorrhea, Garnerella, Vaginalis, Salmonella Typhu and other enteric pathogens. He also found that it was fungicidal for Candida Albicans, Candida Globata and M. Furfur.</P>
<P><I>Science Digest</I> reported in an article in 1978, entitled "Our Mightiest Germ Fighter" that "silver is emerging as a wonder of  modern medicine." Dr. Robert O. Becker, M.D. stated, "we have rediscovered the fact that silver kills bacteria, which had been known for centuries...when antibiotics were discovered, uses for silver as an antibiotic were discarded."</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>COLLOID</H2>
<P>The term "colloid" refers to a substance that consists of ultra-fine particles within the range of 0.005 to 0.015 microns in diameter. In a true colloid, like Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER, these particles cannot be seen by the naked eye and stay suspended as they are electrically charged. This activates the germicidal quality of the silver.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>PRODUCTION</H2>
<P>The "grind" method can b used, but the particles are too large and a protein, or other, stabilizer has to be included. However, stabilizers can interfere with effectiveness. Also, a chemical process can be used but the end product is usually too acid and not as effective.</P>
<P>Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER is produced by the electrocolloidal process, which allows extremely fine silver particles to be suspended in solution by the tiny charge placed n them. This process replaces the need for any chemicals or stabilizers and the product can be called a true colloid. Then, the particles can remain in suspension almost indefinitely.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>COLOR</H2>
<P>Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER is the ideal golden yellow color. Other products that are not true colloids will be another color, unless coloring is added. Color is a critical indicator of colloidal silver quality.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>AS NATURE INTENDED</H2>
<P>Silver may be linked to the proper functioning of our immune system and that people with inadequate intakes may be more prone to infection. Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER contains 99.999% pure colloidal silver particles 0.0001 microns in diameter with a concentration of 20 parts per million that have little effect on the friendly bacteria in our digestive tract. However, be aware of products with higher concentrations as they can attack friendly bacteria just like some antibiotics. This could upset your natural balance and lead to other complications. With colloidal silver, higher concentrations are not necessarily better. As a matter of fact, the opposite is usually true.<P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>HOW TO USE COLLOIDAL SILVER</H2>
<P>When used as an antibiotic, adults and children twelve and older, take one, two or three teaspoonfuls of Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER by mouth three times a day. Younger children can take half this amount. It is tasteless, odorless and non-irritating to sensitive tissues such as the eyes, so it can also be used like a first aid spray on cuts, sores, burns, insect bites, etc.</P>
<P>Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER is furnished with a sprayer top on the bottle. The sprayer makes it convenient to use as a topical spray. However, it is recommended that you also spray it into the mouth when taking it orally. Forty pumps from the sprayer equals one teaspoonful of solution. For maximum utilization, pump several sprays into the mouth, hold for a few seconds and swallow. Repeat this process until forty full pumps are swallowed for each teaspoonful desired. This allows the silver to be absorbed sublingually (under the tongue), getting it into the system sooner, plus bypassing the intestinal flora.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: Adult and children 12 years and older, take one to three
teaspoonfuls three times per day as needed. Children under 12, take one-half
the adult dosage. Can be sprayed on sores, cuts and burns as well.

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS </H2>

<P>   Many biological functions are rhythmic such as the short rhythms of breathing and heartbeat. Longer patterns are common, such as monthly menstrual cycles and annual seasonal cycles.  Daily rhythms are called circadian, from circa" meaning about, and "dies" meaning day. The daily rise and fall of blood pressure, excretions and changes in body temperature are known, but the most common is the melatonin induced sleep/wake cycle. By changing the length of time we are exposed to varying intensities of light during a day, it is possible to affect the timing of melatonin production and disrupt our sleep patterns. This can be experienced with jet travel.  As we traverse several time zones, our production of melatonin gets out of sync with the new time causing jet lag. Also, if one's job requires them to work different shifts, it can take days to get used to the new time resulting in feeling tired most of the time. Understanding circadian rhythms can be meaningful. Vitality is lowest at midnight. For example, death after surgery occurs three times as frequently at midnight than noon. Benefits of taking medications and supplements can be maximized taking these cycles into account. Biological clocks are known to become disorganized in diseased states. This lack of synchronization may not be a mere symptom but part of the disease itself.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PINEAL GLAND</H2>
<P>   The pineal gland is located in the brain and serves as a "light detector" or "third eye."   Light sets the timing mechanism of the brain's internal clock each morning as it enters the lens of the eye and stimulates the retina. Impulses are sent to the hypothalamus and transmitted along the optic nerve and into the sympathetic nervous system and the pineal gland. These impulses inhibit the activity of an enzyme required to produce melatonin, so melatonin production decreases. Then, each night the "clock" signals the pineal gland to secrete the sleep producing hormone melatonin.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SLEEP</H2>
<P>  Lowered levels of nighttime melatonin reduce the quality of sleep resulting in the need for more sleep. If your pineal gland does not produce adequate melatonin early enough in the evening, it is difficult to go to sleep. If secretion does not continue, you may wake up too soon. If your pineal gland secretes too much or for too long into the next day, you will have a tendency to be sleepy and not rested the next morning. Continuing melatonin production into the day can also result in depression and tiredness. If you do not get adequate sleep, mental acuity decreases, too. Insomnia exists when melatonin levels are low or when it is produced at the wrong time. Supplementing can help re-establish balance and help you set your biological clock.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENDOCRINE & IMMUNE SYSTEMS</H2>
<P>   There is a close correlation between the pineal and the pituitary/adrenal endocrine glands. Low melatonin levels are associated with lessened thymus activity, steroids metabolism and depression. Much of the activity of the immune system takes place at night and it is thought that melatonin interacts 
with our immune system during sleep. Melatonin may be an anti-stress factor and its normal rhythmic release is a buffering device, quenching the adverse effects of stress on the immune system. Some researchers believe the steady increase in the incidence of cancer is partially because of the extended time we are exposed to artificial lighting. This results in extended hours each day that melatonin production is suppressed when levels would have been higher longer. Melatonin levels of breast and prostate patients are reduced to half the normal levels.  Conditions associated with elevated estrogen levels such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis and premenstrual syndrome may be prevented by normal systemic levels of melatonin.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BRAIN & CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM</H2>
<P>   Melatonin stabilizes electrical activity of the central nervous system. The pineal, primarily through melatonin, acts as a synchronizing and stabilizing organ. Nighttime melatonin levels are low in people with major depressive and panic disorders.  Individuals with noticeable mood swings or melancholy also have depressed melatonin levels.  Both seasonal  affective  disorders  and  non-seasonal  cyclic depressions are related to the peaks and valleys of melatonin levels.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING</H2>
<P>  Stress and/or dietary lack of tryptophan may make deficiencies of melatonin common. Older individuals have a reduced ability to produce melatonin. The relationships of endocrine rhythms, mood, sleep and the biological effects of light are complex. Since melatonin secretion declines with age, many researchers believe that it may help prevent age-related and free radical mediated brain damage. The melatonin corticoid  relationship  has  significance  since  chronic hypercortisolemia has been associated with age related deterioration of the brain (including Alzheimer's disease), glucose intolerance, atherosclerosis, impaired immune function and cancer. Melatonin appears to mediate the entire aging process.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE </H2>
<P>SOMNISET is formulated in the proprietary Life PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty   natural   concentrates   of  numerous   valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products. you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE IT</H2>
 <P>  The recommended range is from one to five tablets from about  thirty to forty-five minutes before  bedtime. SOMNISET is not a drug but a natural supplement supportive of natural metabolic rhythms, so several days supplementation may be needed to begin seeing results. Start with one or two tablets and increase as needed after three nights. More is not necessarily better if not needed.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TYPES OF MINERALS </H2>

  <P> Three different types exist, metallic, chelated and colloidal.   Metallic minerals are most commonly used in nutritional supplements, especially for the major minerals because larger amounts are indicated. They have the least degree of absorption. Chelated minerals are the next step up the ladder. The metallic mineral is "chelated" with an amino acid. The "mineral chelate" is more bioavailable.  Colloidal Minerals occur in nature as small particles that either are or can be easily dispersed in a dispersion medium. Plant Derived Colloidal Minerals provide the best of all worlds because they are colloidal in nature and are associated with natural plant tissues, giving them all of the advantages of chelated minerals and more. Erosion and unwise farming methods have made mineral-rich soil a rare commodity.  The result is mineral deficient plants and livestock, and mineral-deficient people.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ORGANIC HUMIC SHALE</H2>
<P>    The best quality plant derived colloidal minerals in the world are concentrated from the mineral rich natural organic humic shale in the Rockland Mine. About 75 million years ago, the Earth's mineral-rich soils produced succulent fruits, vegetables and lush forests. The soils contained at least 84 minerals, which is why some experts believe some trees grew ten feet the first year.</P>
 <P>   Plant and animal life was extremely healthy and it is believed that a major reason is a direct result of the plants' access to at least 77 minerals from the soil. This is a far cry from the number of minerals available from the average soil throughout the world today. As the lucious vegetation died, it accumulated in deposits. It was compressed or compacted so that all of the moisture in it was eliminated.  What remains today is a deposit of dried, prehistoric plant derivatives known as organic humic shale.</P>
<P>   This organic humic shale contains 77 plant derived hydrophilic minerals which are very small in size when compared to metallic minerals. Because the minerals in humic shale were assimilated by plants, they are naturally incorporated into the tissues of the plant and are more hydrophilic and more readily utilized</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLLOIDS AND COLLOIDAL SOLUTIONS </H2>
<P>Colloidal science is devoted to the study of systems in which finely divided substances (colloids) are dispersed within a medium. A colloidal system can be a solid dispersed in a gas, solid-in-solid, solid-in-liquid, gas-in-gas, gas-in-liquid, liquid-in-liquid. etc. A colloidal system is not really a solution in which one substance is totally dissolved into the other hand, a colloidal system it is not really a suspension either.  In a suspension, the particles of the substance being suspended are larger and remain in the solid state.</P>
 <P>   Some people do not realize that solids can be colloids. A colloid is one thing and a colloidal solution is another.  A colloidal solution is merely a system in which a colloid has been dispersed in a liquid. Most all of the so-called colloidal mineral nutritional products on the market today are liquids. Actually, most of them are not true colloids at all. They have been manufactured by extracting some source material such as shale, clay or sea bed with citric or some other kind of acid. In this process, the acid helps dissolve the minerals and breaks down much of the organic matter in the source material, which occurs naturally associated with the minerals.  This acid extraction can actually destroy the plant-derived colloidal nature of most minerals and trace elements.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE ROCKLAND PROCESS</H2>
 <P>   The proprietary low-temperature Rockland process uses only cool, contaminant free water.  By maintaining low temperatures, the integrity of the natural delicate state of plant derived minerals is maintained.  A major advantage of the finished product is that the super highly concentrated plant-derived colloidal material is maintained in its natural state and can be easily hydrated by water to become a colloidal solution.</P>
<P>    The humic shale is mined in the natural dry state as it has existed for millions of years.  It is then ground to smaller aggregates and placed in stainless steel vats, where it is leached slowly. No acids are used. Negative pressure is applied which makes the concentration more efficient at low temperatures. Only the water is removed and the solid plant-derived colloidal minerals are all that are present, but in a highly concentrated form.</P>
<P>    When the leaching is complete, the mother liquor contains 38.000 milligrams of the 7 major minerals and 70 trace minerals per quart of liquid. When dried, the colloidal powder is placed in capsules of 600 mg each so that one capsule is equivalent to one half ounce of liquid, in so far as mineral content is concerned.</P>
<P>   This unique method makes it possible to have a dry product that can be made into capsules containing high quality plant-derived colloidal minerals just as they were in their natural state. When swallowed with water, the minerals in Micro-Mins capsules readily return to their liquid colloidal state in the digestive tract and provide all the advantages of the liquid form without the disadvantages.</P>
<P>    Metallic minerals carry a positive charge in their ionic Form in solution and, in general, are just not very soluble. Scientifically, they are called hydrophobic because they are not very soluble in water. Minerals that have been assimilated by plants are hydrophilic, so they are very water soluble. They are negatively charged and form direct hydrogen bonds with water. Hydrophilic plant-derived minerals, which have not been destroyed by heat or acids or other chemicals, are enzymatically active and thus are highly bioavailable.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ALUMINUM IN OUR FOODS</H2>
<P>   Some people believe that the so-called toxic metals (minerals) are bad regardless of their source. Aluminum is found in the earth is, its metallic form. There is no question about its metallic form, which is well documented that it can be leached from aluminum cooking utensils and absorbed from antiperspirants and deposited in both brain and heart tissue. However, the aluminum, which comes from food, is hydrophilic as it has been assimilated by plants and it is naturally tied to oxygen or silica. The World Health Organization estimates the average adult dietary aluminum intake between 10 and 15 mg per day. Aluminum is one of the most abundant minerals on earth, second only to silica. It is in virtually everything we touch, most of the air we breathe and water we drink. It is in most foods that we eat.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE MICRO-MINS</H2>
<P>   No RDAs are established for most of the minerals in Micro-Mins, however it is known that many are needed for optimum health. They are packaged in bottles of 64 capsules making it convenient for the ideal dosage of two capsules twice a day for two weeks, or two capsules daily for a 30 day supply.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VALUABLE LIPIDS (PUFA'S) </H2>

 <P>  In recent years, interest has matured regarding lipid compounds, which have evolved as valuable nutritional substances. One group of these are the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA's). These fatty acids are named by identifying the number of carbon atoms in their molecule and indicating the number of double or unsaturated bonds. For instance, a PUFA with eighteen carbons and three double bonds would be called 18:3 by scientists.   Some well known sources of PUFA's are the unsaturated cooking oils such as sunflower and canola oils. Soybean oil is well known for its content of PUFA's. Fish oils, which have been researched for their ability to reduce cholesterol and improve health of the heart and circulatory system, also contain PUFA's.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> OMEGA 6 & OMEGA 3</H2>
 <P>  Two basic categories of PUFA's that have received a lot of attention relative to human nutrition are the Omega 6 and Omega 3's. Omega 6 PUFA's are contained in all vegetable oils. Omega 6's are almost totally made up of linoleic acid (18:2) and it's derivatives. Some of the Omega 6's are considered more valuable, such as GLA (gamma linolenic, 18:3) found in evening primrose and borage oils. Omega 3's are found to a limited degree in some plants but are contained in all fish and shellfish.  For instance, canola and flax oils contain alpha linolenic acid (18:3).  The Omega 3 PUFA's contained in fish are from five to ten times more powerful in their biological activity than those found in plants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TERMINOLOGY</H2>
 <P>  There are three known valuable Omega 3 PUFA's in fish. They are  EPA,  DHA  and  the  amazing  LYPRINOL.    EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), the most well known, is usually accompanied by DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). Eicosa means 20, docosa means 22, pent means 5 and hex means 6. So then, eicosapentaenoic acid could be described as 20:5, and docosahexaenoic as 22:6. All this terminology is simply to bring us to a more detailed understanding for discussion purposes about LYPRINOL. We may call them "Super" Omega 3's.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> LYPRINOL</H2>
<P>   The most current research is now demonstrating a whole new group of related, but different PUFA's. Over twenty years of research has produced a better understanding of ETA (eicosaetraennoic acid). ETA is a 20:4, a twenty carbon molecule with four double bonds.  These newly found and isolated compounds have the greatest biological activity of all and show amazing promise for those who need to supplement with them.</P>
<P>  The most valuable ETA's have been extracted from the New Zealand Green-Lipped Mussel, Perna canaliculus. This unique mussel has been used as food for many years in that part of the world and seems to have added greatly to the health of those including it in their diet. One noticeable trait is that they seem to have a significant decrease in stiffness and joint swelling and discomfort as they age. This lead researchers to try to understand why this was so. Scientists have been conducting research on the New Zealand Green-Lipped Mussel now for over thirty years and have been learning some very important facts.</P>
<P>   It  is  acknowledged  by  many  scientists  and  government committees around the world that the western diet provides more Omega 6 PUFA's relative to Omega 3's. This leads to our cellular 
membranes becoming rich in the Omega 6's such as arachidonic acid, which is a precursor to certain molecules that can cause inflammatory processes associated with arthritis, psoriasis and asthma to name a few. Many studies have reported that certain lipids from fish and other marine sources can have a beneficial effect on our overall health when they are a part of the diet on a routine basis.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PERNA CANALICULUS</H2>
<P>   Freeze-dried concentrated and encapsulated mussel tissue in it's raw state was used originally as a natural food supplement for the prevention of pain normally associated with older individuals experiencing joint and muscle discomfort.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> POTENCY</H2>
<P>   There is no doubt among scientists who are aware of this state-of-the-art research that LYPRINOL has evolved as the most potent of all these "Super GLA's", regardless of their source. Independent studies carried out in Australia at the University of Queensland have shown LYPRINOL to be:  200 times more potent that Max EPA, 250 times more potent than Green-Lipped Mussel Extract, 350 times more potent than Evening Primrose Oil, 350 times more potent than Salmon Oil and 400 times more potent than Flax Oil.</P>
<P>   Following fifteen years of scientific research by independent scientists working closely with the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), the goal was achieved with the identification of the principal components responsible for the extract's high potency. The compounds were patented and named LYPRINOL.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS</H2>
<P>   LYPRINOL has been exposed to critical review by researchers at the Universities of Adelaide and Queensland in Australia. Leukotrienes are formed in the body and are known to be responsible for initiating and prolonging the process of inflammation. These leukotrienes are formed by what researchers call the lipoxygenase pathway.   The concentrated ETA's (eicosatetraenoic acids) contained in LYPRINOL have been shown to be potent inhibitors of this lipoxygenase pathway and this is one reason it is believed that individuals with diets rich in ETA's seem to have less discomfort as they age. And, according to the University of Adelaide scientists, "the results were extraordinary" and "these compounds are really very potent nutritional inhibitors of the lipoxygenase pathway."</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE LYPRINOL</H2>
<P>   Most people should begin with two capsules twice a day for one or two weeks. Some may try three times a day during this period. Then, decrease to one or two capsules once or twice a day as desired. The daily level needed to obtain maximum effect can vary for each individual. If your body requires less, temporary initial irritation of symptoms may occur with too high a dosage. If this occurs,  simply decrease the amount taken.   Some individuals with serious needs may not receive maximum benefit from LYPRINOL for four weeks, so it is important to not discontinue too soon.</P>


<BR><BR>
<P>Suggested Use: Two capsules twice a day for seven  to  ten  days,  then  decrease  to  one capsule once or twice a day as desired. More can be taken if needed.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CO-Q-10 PLUS
 </H2>

<P>  Co-Enzyme Q-10 is a nutrient necessary to the functioning of every cell in our bodies. Our bodies could not survive without it.  If body levels start dropping, so does our general health.
   Scientists estimate that once levels drop below the 25% deficient levels, many disease states begin to flourish including high blood pressure, heart attack, angina, immune depression, periodontal disease, lack of energy, weight gain and even early death.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CO-Q-10 AND ENERGY</H2>
<P>  Co-Enzyme Q-10 is known as CO-Q-10 and also ubiquinone.   It is a member of the quinone cyclic compounds that may be considered a relative of some potent anti-cancer drugs.  CO-Q-10 can add or remove oxygen from biologically active molecules.</P>
<P>  Every cell of the body contains many subcellular components called mitochondria, which produce 95% of the total energy of the body. CO-Q-10 is an integral part of the membranes of the mitochondria where it is involved in the production of ATP the basic energy producing molecule of cells.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND AGING</H2>
<P>  When immunity is low, so are the reserves of  CO-Q-10. When body levels of CO-Q-10 are raised, so is the immune potential. AIDS victims and other people with depressed immune systems can receive some help from antibiotic and anti-viral drugs, but they will not rebuild the immune system. Mice have been shown to have a 50% extended life span by supplementing with CO-Q-10.</P>
<P>   Co-Enzyme Q-10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells against free radical damage and exerting a protective effect on cell membranes. CO-Q-10 can naturally stimulate the immune system and result in a wide range of beneficial and protective effects.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE HEART AND BLOOD PRESSURE</H2>
<P>   Tissues that require the most energy (such as the heart) need the largest amounts of CO-Q-10.  Angina is a condition where inadequate oxygen is available to the heart muscle itself.  People with failing cardiac systems have shown to greatly benefit with increased strength and vigor when supplemented with CO-Q-10.  People with high blood pressure usually have lower levels of  CO-Q-10.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CO-Q-10 AND WEIGHT LOSS</H2>
<P>  It has been shown at the University of Texas and the University of Antwerp, Belgium that obese people can lose weight simply with the addition of CO-Q-10 to the diet. This research showed that obese people can have as much as a 50% deficiency of Co-Enzyme Q-10 in their tissues.</P>

<P>  People who eat a lot and yet stay slim have significantly higher levels of CO-Q-10 in their blood.  This wonderful enzyme can increase metabolic fuel efficiency within your cells - stimulating natural weight loss.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PERIODONTAL HEALTH</H2>
<P>  Co-Enzyme  Q-10  exerts  its  protective  and strengthening action in all tissues.  Working from the cellular level, it strengthens the gums as well as the heart muscle.  Many scientists believe that periodontal (gum) disease is a good indicator of low levels of CO-Q-10 in other tissues. The American Dental Association states that at least 87% of the American population has some sort of gum disease. This has been shown to be somewhat related to nutrition and particularly to levels of CO-Q-10, which has been shown to have a good protective effect for gum tissue.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE CO-Q-10 FAMILY</H2>
<P>   There are at least ten common CO-Q's, that is, different sized molecules from CO-Q-1 to CO-Q-10. The liver can utilize other CO-Q's to make CO-Q-10.  If the liver is not functioning efficiently, body levels can be too low, especially with advancing age or if disease is present. Our internal ability to produce CO-Q-10 declines with age, and as we get older, we must rely more on our diet.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IS CO-Q-10 SAFE?</H2>
<P>   In tests of thousands of people, no toxicity has ever been shown, no matter how high the amount. Plants and animals get it from the soil, but we get it from the plants and animals that contain various CO-Q's.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  CO-Q-10 PLUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE CO-Q-10 PLUS</H2>
<P>  There is no definite amount determined, but remember that more is needed as more energy is required. This is especially so if extra nutritional support is needed for the immune system, the heart, to lose weight or to protect against degenerative disease.  Life Plus CO-Q-10 PLUS tablets are packaged in bottles of 60. One to three tablets are recommended one to three times daily.</P>

<P> 
 Suggested Use:  One or more tablets per day</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COMPREHENSIVE </H2>

<P>  TVM-49 is one of the most comprehensive, nutritional supplements ever formulated.  It is the Life Plus basic, nutritional insurance policy for adults and older children. No other product in its category begins to compare with it when you consider the quality and quantity of ingredients, its broad spectrum base and cost per unit of nutrients.</P>
<P>  The body requires a good balance of a wide variety of nutrients as more than one nutrient is usually involved in each individual biochemical reaction in the body. If even one of those nutrients is lacking, the natural health supporting chain reaction cannot take place. If such a lack persists, the body will eventually suffer some form of degeneration or disease.</P>
<P>  TVM-49 is a unique, broad spectrum nutritional supplement TVM-49 ensures the necessary nutrients classified as present in a rational relationship and with numerous synergistic associated nutrients, including many ultra-trace elements, so they can work together harmoniously.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BE SURE WITH TVM-49</H2>
<P>  TVM-49 goes far beyond just vitamins and minerals. It is manufactured by strictly controlled cold processing methods and contains many "super foods" such as Lecithin, Bee Pollen, Kelp and Bioflavonoids. These "super foods" contain many nutritional factors, presently unknown, which could be very essential to good health. The Life Plus proprietary PhytoZyme tablet base contains over thirty natural phytochemical plant concentrates from foods such as broccoli, carrot, cauliflower and several others. TVM-49 also contains the valuable special amino acids L-Glutamic Acid, L-Glutamine and L-Tyrosine, known not just for their traditional value, but for their more newly understood value against brain aging.
  TVM-49 contains numerous trace and ultra-trace minerals such as Chromium, Selenium, Vanadium (as Vanadyl Sulfate), Molybdenum, Germanium, Silicon and Boron, most of which are not contained in other multi-vitamin and mineral products on the market today.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT ABOUT IRON?</H2>
<P>  Iron is intentionally not included in this great formula as it is becoming more apparent that only a small number of people need iron supplements.  Men, in particular, usually do not need iron but some women do. It is believed that the reason some diseases, particularly heart disease and cancer, are more prevalent in men is that they do not routinely lose some of their iron through menstruation as women do. It is now known that excess iron can be responsible, or at least involved, in the production of damaging free radicals in the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT ABOUT MEGA VITAMINS?</H2>
<P>  At Life Plus, we do not believe in taking large amounts of all the vitamins and minerals routinely on a daily basis. At times, the use of larger amounts of certain nutrients, such as Vitamin A, C or E may be worthwhile. You may want to use larger amounts of certain amino acids or enzymes.   TVM-49 supplies you with a substantial amount of about every nutrient the average person needs daily.  Four tablets a day will give you 100% of the RDA of everything except calcium and magnesium. TVM-49 contains calcium and magnesium, but due to their sheer bulk, six tablets are required to obtain the full RDA quantities.</P>
<P>  Our bodies are simply fantastic! If we furnish them with adequate amounts of the required nutrients, combined with a reasonable lifestyle, they maintain themselves against the various toxicants they are exposed to   each   day. Because our foods do not contain the quantities of nutrients they did in the past, and because we are exposed to more pollutants in our environment, in the foods we eat and the water we drink, it only makes sense to supplement daily with TVM-49.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  TVM-49 is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE TVM-49 </H2>
<P>It is recommended that children over twelve years of age and adults take four tablets each day, usually two tablets with breakfast and two with the evening meal for the nutritional insurance you need.  You may add to your program as desired with such products as <A HREF="mcalmag.htm">CALMAG
PLUS</A>,  <A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS</A>, <A HREF="mmagicm.htm">INNER MAGIC M</A> or <A HREF="mmagicf.htm">INNER MAGIC F</A> depending on your needs.  Strongly consider the <A HREF="msyn.htm">Life Plus SYNERGY PAK</A>; it contains TVM-49 and three other synergistic foundational products making a great foundational nutrient supplement program.</P>

<P>Suggested Use:  Two tablets twice a day with breakfast and evening meal as a basic nutritional 
supplement.</P>

<BR><BR>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NEEDS VARY </H2>

<P>  Vitamin C is the most talked about and most studied vitamin.   It naturally reinforces hundreds of defense mechanisms in the body. With the exception of man, almost all other animals are able to manufacture their own. However, we must obtain it from food or supplements.</P>
<P>   Individual needs for Vitamin C vary from person to person and from day to day, according to the types and amount of stress that is experienced.  Dr. Linus Pauling, the world's leader in Vitamin C research, consistently took 6,000 mg per day for years, which he considered to be the absolute minimum, even though the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) is only 60 mg per day. Most doctors and scientist agree that we routinely need more since the RDA was determined to be enough to only prevent scurvy.</P>
<P>   Those who live in cities or near busy highways may suffer from carbon monoxide and lead poisoning. In large doses, Vitamin C has been shown to have a protective effect of pulling the carbon monoxide away from the hemoglobin in the red blood cells, so the oxygen can become attached and be carried to the cells.</P>
<P>   Pregnant women who take adequate amounts of Vitamin C have less problem with leg cramps, fluid retention and toxemia.</P>
<P>   It  has  been  proven  that  Vitamin  C  increases  certain biochemical reactions in white blood cells that kill bacteria. There are many bacteria, viruses, and allergies which can be associated in various ways with colds.  Vitamin C does not provide complete protection against all of them. Nonetheless, your odds are probably better while taking it.</P>
<P>   If you smoke one pack of cigarettes a day, you have about 25C/o less Vitamin C in your blood than non-smokers.  Those who drink a lot of alcoholic beverages need Vitamin C, because the liver depends on it to produce an enzyme that helps take alcohol out of the bloodstream. Aspirin depletes the body of Vitamin C and blocks the blood cells from absorbing it. The more exposure to drugs and chemicals, the more Vitamin C is needed to minimize harmful effects.</P>
<P>   Diabetics seem to lack the ability to transport Vitamin C across their cell membranes, which can result in serious blood vessel complications, which is common among diabetics. Dr. George Mann of Vanderbilt University states that "cataracts may be a late consequence of marginal intakes of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), with the diabetic being more prone to cataracts because of their lack of insulin."</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLLAGEN</H2>
<P>   Vitamin C is necessary for healthy metabolism of skin and connective tissues. Collagen is the major component of skin and connective tissues in our bodies and is the "glue" that holds our bodies together. It cannot be manufactured without Vitamin C. As long as our tissues have the strength provided by collagen, they are able to resist the invasion of infections. Defective collagen assumes a watery consistency and leaks into the bloodstream. The cells are then easily permeated, and all kinds of diseases can run rampant.</P>
<P>   Dr.  Constance  Leslie  of  Pindersfields  Hospital  in Wakefield, England and many other doctors believe that Vitamin C causes cholesterol to come out of arterial plaque into the blood.  It can then be used by the liver to make bile salts for digestion.</P>
 <P>  The brain has a greater concentration of Vitamin C than most other tissues in the body.  Dr. Pauling proved that insufficient Vitamin C can impair mentality.  There is strong evidence that ascorbic acid helps brain functioning.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CHELATION</H2>
<P>   Studies show that Vitamin C reduces the danger of mercury, cadmium and lead poisoning. With cars emitting at least 500 million pounds of lead into the atmosphere each year, it is estimated that over 200,000 American children are victims of chronic lead poisoning. It is difficult to avoid cadmium. You get it from passive cigarette smoke, white bread, coffee and tea, to name a few sources.  The FDA reported in Science Magazine that Vitamin C protects against cadmium toxicity.</P>
<P>   Vitamin C protects against nitrosamines, cancer causing chemicals that are made in the stomach from nitrates and nitrites in foods like hot dogs, bacon, luncheon meat and smoked fish.</P>
<P>   Thousands and thousands of papers have been published by reliable researchers from all over the world about Vitamin C. We cannot begin to list all the ways our bodies need Vitamin C, but these few things will give you an idea of its importance.</P>
<P>  Life Plus is careful to include a broad spectrum of bioflavonoids in VITA-C-1000-TR, as these substances occur with Vitamin C in nature.  Bioflavonoids are involved with every major metabolic process of the body, and they act synergistically with Vitamin C.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>   VITA-C-1000 is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE VITA-C-1000</H2>
<P>   There is no generally accepted amount of Vitamin C to take as everyone has different needs. The RDA of only 60 mg is considered way too low and is only the amount necessary to prevent scurvy. However, larger amounts are needed in times of stress. Many experts believe that teenagers should probably take at least 2,000 mg per day, and most adults may do best on a minimum of 4,000 mg per day or more. Don't forget to include other Life Plus products you take that contain Vitamin C in computing your total consumption such as <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A>, <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>, <A HREF="msupt.htm">SUPPORT TABS</A>, <A HREF="mprotx.htm">PROTX II</A> and <A HREF="mcombat.htm">COMBAT</A>.

<td colspan=2>This Vitamin E is the highest quality available and most natural d-alpha tocopherol succinate type. This form ensures stability against oxidation plus the best absorption into the body.</td>

<BR><BR>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMPORTANT NUTRIENT </H2>

<P>   Next to Vitamin C, Vitamin E has probably received the most attention from researchers and is probably the next most important vitamin. Doctors Wilfred and Evan Shute were the first to show, years ago, that Vitamin E saved lives from myocardial infraction, which is the most common type of heart attack. They also gave Vitamin E to women who were pregnant to help them avoid complications. They found Vitamin E to be of great value in preventing miscarriages.</P>
<P>  The best food source of Vitamin E is whole grains, especially wheat. However, most individuals use white flour which has been stripped of all its Vitamin E. Vegetable oils are our next best source. However, most of the vegetable oils that are available commercially have been exposed to radiation, so free radicals have formed in them. This even increases our need for Vitamin E. In addition, the processing of the oils removes most of their Vitamin E, leaving an oil that gives no protection against the free radicals it easily forms.</P>
<P>   A National Institutes of Health study has revealed that the average dietary intake of Vitamin E is about 14 international units. They have also established an RDA of 30 units. It is easy to see from these figures that the average person receives less than half of the RDA for Vitamin E.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANTIOXIDANT</H2>
<P>   Vitamin E is one of the best antioxidants known. One of its roles is to see that the oxygen in our bodies is not used on harmful or useless substances before it reaches the cells. Having adequate amounts of Vitamin E is more important today than ever before, because we are exposed to so many pollutants that interfere with healthy oxygen metabolism. Vitamin E is especially valuable for tissues that require lots of oxygen, such as the heart, brain and sex glands.</P>
<P>   Without adequate amounts of Vitamin E in the blood, our red blood cells break open and are destroyed. This condition is  referred  to  as  hemolytic  anemia  and  is  common  in newborn babies, especially those born prematurely. In the late 1960's astronauts on the Gemini mission developed this condition because their Vitamin E was quickly used up in the atmosphere they lived in. Since Vitamin E helps prevent anemia by protecting red blood cells from being destroyed by peroxides, it has been given to all astronauts since 1969 and this condition is no longer a problem.</P>
<P>  Breathing the air around some major cities can be hazardous to your health because of industrial and automotive pollution. The FDA has determined that a level as low as .05 parts per million of ozone is dangerous. They have shown that the toxicity of ozone is comparable to phosgene, a gas used in warfare. In Los Angeles, the ozone capital of the world, a typical concentration in the air is about 10 to 20 times the danger level.  Vitamin E blocks the damaging oxidation of healthy cells by ozone and is therefore a natural defense.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PREVENTION</H2>
<P>  Vitamin E helps to develop new veins between the existing ones. This helps the blood get from congested veins or varicose veins to more healthy ones. This is referred to as developing collateral circulation so the blood can circulate back to the heart.  Vitamin E can also help prevent intermittent claudication or lameness. Individuals with this condition can only walk short distances without developing severe leg cramps and pain.</P>
<P>  The estrogen related hormones in birth control pills neutralize Vitamin E and reduces its level in the blood stream.  Because Vitamin E naturally dissolves fibrin, the protein that organizes the formation of blood clots, women on "the pill" are known to be more prone to develop clots because Vitamin E levels are low. They should supplement with Vitamin E.</P>
<P>  Research has shown that reasonable levels of both Vitamin E and Selenium are necessary for either one of them to benefit our bodies. Unfortunately, the soils in certain areas of the U.S. are very deficient in selenium. Interestingly, the citizens of Rapid City, South Dakota have the highest blood levels of selenium and the lowest cancer rate in the U.S. On the other hand, Lima, Ohio has the highest rate of cancer and the lowest level of Selenium in the blood of its citizens. It is a good idea to make sure that your selenium levels are up to par as well. Selenium is included in <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A>  and <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>. It is intentionally not included in VITA-E-PLUS 400 to guard against over supplementing with selenium.</P>
<P>  Most Vitamin E supplements are gelatin capsules containing oil.  Some of their Vitamin E is used up as an antioxidant protecting the oil. This is great for the oil, but it leaves less available for you. The natural d-alpha tocopherol succinate form of Vitamin E used in VITA-E-PLUS 400 is stable to oxidation, which ensures full potency. In addition, it is water soluble so it is more readily absorbed into the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>   VITA-E-PLUS 400 is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty   natural  concentrates  of  numerous   valuable phytonutrients from plants.   When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE VITA-E-PLUS 400</H2>
<P>  VITA-E-PLUS 400 is taken by those who want larger amounts of Vitamin E in their nutritional programs. Usually one or two tablets are taken per day, preferably after mid-day.</P>



 <P>
Suggested Use:  One tablet once or twice a day. </P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE FORMULA </H2>

<P>  VITA-SAURUS is a naturally flavored, good tasting, chewable, multiple-type supplement for children of all ages. Older adults and individuals that have difficulty swallowing tablets can take it, too. A great deal of work and experience has gone into developing it.  It was developed  by  a  panel  including  pediatricians, biochemists and a pharmacist with years of experience in this field. They saw a need for a totally comprehensive multiple for children and VITA-SAURUS was designed and developed for that reason.</P>
<P>  We have challenged people to look in any drug store or health food store and try to find one that even comes close to VITA-SAURUS. None can be found. All other children's multiples contains Vitamins A, C, D and a small amount of B-Complex. For all practical purposes, most all other chewable products available are made in a base of regular table sugar and flavored with synthetic substances so they will taste like candy.  They are all loaded with different synthetic food coloring agents. (Studies have been done in several public school systems proving that the various food additives, including coloring agents, cause hyperkinetic children). These so called "nutritional products" usually gain their appeal by widespread intensive TV advertising, not because of their nutritional value.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NATURAL FLAVOR</H2>
<P>  VITA-SAURUS is flavored with a blend of natural extracts from citrus, pineapple, grape and cherry.  It is sweetened with fructose, a natural fruit sugar that does not stimulate the insulin response by the pancreas like regular table sugar. VITA-SAURUS does not contain any artificial coloring, flavoring agents or preservatives.</P>
<P>  Natural Beta-Carotene, which is totally safe even in large amounts, is used as the source of vitamin A. As in all  Life  Plus  products,  the  Vitamin  D  found  in VITA-SAURUS is natural Vitamin D-3 from fish liver oil. Also included are oil soluble Vitamins E and Vitamin K. Very few children's supplements contain Vitamin E and we know of none that contain Vitamin K.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MINERALS AND TRACE ELEMENTS</H2>
<P>  VITA-SAURUS is the only children's product that contains all of the trace minerals, Manganese, Copper, Zinc, Iodine, Selenium, Molybdenum, Chromium and Vanadium, in addition to the two standard important minerals, Calcium and Magnesium.</P>
<P>  Trace minerals are every bit as important in nutrition  as vitamins.  Chromium supports the pancreas in its production of insulin, which controls carbohydrate metabolism. Since children have a tendency to eat far too much sugar and other refined carbohydrates, Chromium is an important ingredient in any children's supplement.</P>
<P>  Selenium,  Molybdenum  and  Vanadium  are antioxidants that help fight the free radicals formed because of various pollutants, such as food preservatives in the diet and radiation from TV sets.   These free radicals can actually stimulate the formation of cancer. It is interesting to note that next to accidents, cancer is the leading cause of death today in children under the age of 19.</P>
<P>  In  addition  to  the  vitamins  and  minerals, VITA-SAURUS contains many additional associated nutrients.   The Citrus  Bioflavonoids,  Rutin and Hesperidin, that are synergistic with Vitamin C, are included.

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HEMATINIC </H2>

<P>  LIVER PLUS IRON is a "hematinic." It is a tonic for the  blood.  Liver  has  long  been  known  as  a blood building food.  LIVER PLUS IRON is much more than just liver and iron. It is a special combination of carefully selected vitamins, minerals, herbs and concentrated tissue nutrients, which are all valuable in supporting the blood building process in the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT IS IRON POOR BLOOD?</H2>
<P>  Hemoglobin is the substance in red blood cells that carry the oxygen from the lungs to all the tissues of the body. Iron is used in the formation of hemoglobin, and so a deficiency of iron in the diet can retard the production of hemoglobin. This could result in the tissues receiving a reduced amount of oxygen from the lungs and a feeling of tiredness may develop. People who feel tired all the time and have low hemoglobin, can get very good results by taking LIVER PLUS IRON.</P>
<P>  There have been many products on the market over the years, composed mostly of iron, designed to help prevent anemia. Nearly everyone has seen the old TV commercials about "iron poor blood."  LIVER PLUS IRON is the ideal product for those who have a known condition  of anemia or a tendency  to develop anemia.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> LIFE PLUS ADVANTAGE</H2>
<P>  Various iron supplements on the market today contain different types of iron. Some are very difficult to digest, but they are often used as they can be manufactured at low cost. Furthermore, the wrong kind of iron, or even too   much   iron   supplementation,   may   cause constipation. Life Plus uses only a high quality chelated form of iron that is most easily absorbed and used by the body.</P>
<P>  Vitamin C ensures that the iron stays in its ferrous form so it can be used by the body. Therefore, Vitamin C is also included in LIVER PLUS IRON.</P>
<P>  Because the spleen produces red blood cells, it is valuable to the over all goal that a blood building supplement include support nutrients from bovine spleen tissue.   For this reason, Life Plus has also included Vitamin B-12 and Folic Acid, as they nutritionally support both the liver and the spleen and are important factors in the absorption of iron.</P>
<P>  LIVER PLUS IRON also contains concentrated tissue nutrients from liver and spleen for the nutritional support they contain. Liver, of course, has been recommended by doctors for years for its nutritional value. Concentrated tissue nutrients from bovine stomach and duodenum are included as well because of their synergistic nutritional effects and because they aid in the absorption of iron. All of these tissue nutrients have been concentrated by the freeze drying method to preserve their nutritional values.</P>
<P>  Unlike other hematinics, LIVER PLUS IRON also contains Marrow and three special herbal substances that are also known for their hematinic effect.  These are Spinach Leaf powder, Beet Root powder and Rhubarb Root.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  LIVER PLUS IRON is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE LIVER PLUS IRON</H2>
 <P>  Generally, one tablet twice a day at breakfast and the evening meal is recommended when needed. It is best to take LIVER PLUS IRON with meals.</P>


 <P>
Suggested Use:  One tablet twice a day when needed. </P>

<H1>SYNERGY PAK: Foundational Nutritional Program</H1>
<BR>
<HR>



<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT </H2>

<P>The four Life Plus products contained in the SYNERGY PAK work together synergistically to help you start your nutritional support program. Many of us want to begin a nutritional program but we do not know how or where to begin.  SYNERGY PAK contains the four basic nutritional products to help get you started.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TVM-49</H2>
<P><A HREF="mtvm.htm"> TVM-49</A> is one of Life Plus' most complete and comprehensive supplement ever formulated. It is an important component of the SYNERGY PAK as it contains all the vitamins, minerals, trace and ultra trace elements that have been classified as essential. The herbs and associated synergistic nutrients it contains helps ensure a broad spectrum nutritional base. TVM-49 contains at least 200% of the RDA's of all  vitamins  that  are  classified. TVM-49  is manufactured by strictly controlled cold processing methods and contains many "super foods" such as Lecithin, Bee Pollen, Kelp and bioflavonoids. These "super foods" contain many nutritional factors. It is presently formulated to not contain iron as recent research shows that even slightly elevated iron levels can stimulate the production of damaging free-radicals in the body leading to disease.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROTX II</H2>
<P> The specialty formula contained in <A HREF="mprotx.htm">PROTX II</A> supplies the nutrients for protecting body cells and our immune system from free radicals.  Free radicals assault our cells ever minute of every day.  They contain a super reactive type of oxygen that is eager to damage DNA. We obtain these from the food we eat, the air we breath, cigarette smoke) to name only a few.  These Free radicals are generated by chemicals in our environment, our diets and are produced by various kinds of radiation, electrical and ultraviolet light. PROTX II supplies us with a wide spectrum of certain antioxidant nutrients such as Vitamin E, Vitamin C and Vitamin A (as Beta-Carotene) and actually present themselves to the free radicals. They then react with them so that the constituents of our cells are protected. PROTX II ensures the body is provided with a broad spectrum of antioxidant nutrients on a daily basis.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUSTENASE</H2>
<P> The unique method in which  <A HREF="msust.htm">SUSTENASE</A> is manufactured provides a product that employs a two phase method that naturally assists the digestion of the foods we eat.  This two phase method assists the stomach (phase 1) and in the intestine (phase 2). It helps to ensure that we receive the nutrients contained in our foods. Proper digestion reduces stomach stress, relieves discomfort from overeating and aids in preventing symptoms of improper digestion, such as gas, bloating, burping and heartburn. In the stomach phase, SUSTENASE helps maintain acid pH by supplying Betain HCI which activates the protein digesting enzyme, Pepsin.  In its intestinal phase, it helps maintain a more alkaline pH.   Complete digestion of proteins is helpful in preventing food allergies. As a component of the SYNERGY PAK it is a basic product that everyone should have at every meal.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLODYNE </H2>
<P>The  soluble  fibers  and  herbs  contained  in <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> help cleanse the lower intestine, especially the colon.   They help ease conditions resulting from diets too low in fiber.  Most leading advisory panels recommend that our diets contain a minimum of thirty grams of fiber per day which is accomplished by one heaping teaspoonful of COLODYNE.  COLODYNE helps to naturally cleanse and correct chronic constipation. This great product contains beneficial bacteria that live in the digestive  tract  and  promotes  colon  hygiene, manufacture vitamins and helps maintain proper pi-I and control overgrowth of yeasts.  It also absorbs toxins that arise from incomplete digestion or contaminated foods.  Studies show that people with high  fiber diets  are  less  likely  to  develop arteriosclerosis and colon cancer.</A>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE THE SYNERGY PAK</H2>
<P> Simplicity is the key to SYNERGY PAK. Not only do you get the advantage of an easy to use program, you also get quality products as well. Take one heaping teaspoonful of COLODYNE in juice in the morning, two TVM-49 with one PROTX II at breakfast and evening meal.  Take one SUSTENASE with each meal.</P>



<BR><BR><BR>

Suggested Use:  Take one heaping teaspoon of Colodyne in juice each morning ,  two TVM-49 and one 
Protx II with breakfast and evening meal, and take one Sustenase with meals.</P>

<H1>maQ-PAK:  Advanced Supplemental Program Supports The Circulatory, Immune and Digestive Systems: Contains Fiber, Antioxidants and Colloidal Minerals
</H1>
<BR>
<HR>
<P><P>


<h2>Each Pak Contains:</h2><BR>

<UL>
<LI>150 tablets   Cardio-Chelex </LI>
<LI>90 tablets     Support Tabs </LI>
<LI>64 capsules  Micro-Mins </LI>
<LI>60 tablets     Proanthenols Bio-Complex 50 mg </LI>
<LI>90 tablets    Sustenase</LI>
<LI>10.7 ounce   Colodyne </LI>
</UL>


<P>The maQ-PAK is the more advanced Life Plus supplemental nutritional program. Like the SYNERGY PAK, it is basic to good health but contains a broader spectrum and larger quantities of more specialized products. CARDIO-CHELEX  and SUPPORT TABS provide a full array of multiple vitamins and minerals divided into two products to be taken at different times for optimum results. 
<P>This ensures you get the best of both worlds; the valuable immune system support and oral chelating cleansing of the circulatory system by CARDIO-CHELEX in the morning, plus the great anti-stress and energy benefits of SUPPORT TABS in the afternoon.
<P>In addition, the maQ-PAK contains MICRO-MINS for a full spectrum of 77 high quality, plant-derived colloidal minerals and the popular PROANTHENOLS BIO-COMPLEX antioxidant tablets that not only provide their own benefits, but help other antioxidants, like those in CARDIO-CHELEX, to work even better.
<P>The maQ-PAK also contains SUSTENASE digestive enzyme tablets that help digest food insuring you obtain the nutrients from the food you eat. 
<P>COLODYNE is also included as just one heaping teaspoonful provides a major portion of the high quality soluble fiber that you need each day, plus herbs and beneficial microflora that support colon hygiene and ecology and helps keep bowel elimination regular. COLODYNE and SUSTENASE taken together greatly reduce discomfort from digestive stress such as gas, bloating, lack of regularity and tiredness. The maQ-PAK is packaged in a re-usable, vinyl drawstring tote.
<P><P>
<H2>Q-PAK</H2><P>
The original "Q-PAK" name came from "Quintessence" meaning "the pure concentrated essence."  This kit helps make your nutritional program even more complete and more advanced yet simple and cost effective.  We also call the Q-PAK, the maQ-PAK (mack pack) because most Members purchase it on their Monthly Automatic qualifying program where it is automatically shipped to them each month so they don't have to remember to order it.<P><P><P> 




 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CARDIO-CHELEX </H2>

<P><A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> is specially formulated to help the body nutritionally cleanse itself of many environmental pollutants. Good circulation is extremely important, because without it oxygen and nutrients could not reach our cells, and life would come to a screeching halt. Poor circulation puts stress on all organs of the body.   Several factors contribute to poor circulation such as diet, free radicals, pollution, certain drugs and chemicals, xanthan oxidase in homogenized milk, depressed immunity, a decreased ability of the blood to digest protein and anabolic disturbances in metabolism. When blood clots have a great chance of forming, heart attack, phlebitis, and stroke are more likely. <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> is the only product in existence that contains proteolytic enzymes and is catabolically balanced. Life Plus <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> contains 47 special nutrients that work synergistically for overall nutritional support.  <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> contains Carnitine and Mucoploysaccharides. Large amounts of Vitamin A and C are included, because they are natural anti-oxidants, immune stimulants and natural cleansing agents as well. Trypsin and Chymotrypsin are potent pancreatic enzymes that naturally keep the proteolytic activity of the blood up to proper levels. <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> is designed with prevention in mind. Common symptoms of poor circulation are cold hands and feet, tiredness, high and low blood pressure, difficult breathing and diminished vision. People living in areas that have high pollution levels should strongly consider <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>. Improved circulation can improve energy and alertness, increase stamina, and increase oxygen and nutrition to every organ of the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUPPORT TABS</H2>
<P><A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> was originally formulated to support specific needs of alcoholics.  The core formula is based on research at Rutgers University. The research was undertaken to determine specific nutritional needs for organs in the body damaged by the stress of excessive alcohol consumption. That is, to help them maintain healthy metabolic processes and also rebuild. <A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> is helpful in breaking habits such as drinking alcohol, overeating, smoking and using drugs. <A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> fight the afternoon "blahs" that often develop as the stress of the day wears on. The amino acids and tissue nutrients support the organs normally fatigued the most by stress, especially the adrenal glands, which are the primary organs that tight stress, the liver and pancreas.  The amino acids, concentrated tissue nutrients, specific vitamins and minerals in <A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> serve as fuel for the nervous system to provide energy, but also create a natural calming effect.  They help greatly to maintain more consistent blood sugar levels helping the body maintain energy and control the ups and downs associated with low blood sugar levels. Many people have great results with <A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> helping them control excessive appetite and cravings.</P>


<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MICRO-MINS</H2><P>
Minerals  are  components  of  our  connective  and supportive tissues as well as the hormones and enzymes responsible for our biochemical life. U.S. Senate document 264 stated, "Our physical well-being is more directly dependent upon the minerals we take into our systems than upon calories or vitamins or upon the precise proportion of starch, protein or curbohydrates we consume." Trace minerals are only required in very small amounts, but this does not mean they are less important. A deficiency of any of them can be as serious as any vitamin deficiency.  The 77 plant-derived colloidal minerals contained in <A HREF="mmicro.htm"> MICRO-MINS</A> are absolutely the most complete array of minerals available.<P><P>



<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROANTHENOLS</H2><P>
 Free radicals damage our cells and cause premature aging, reduced immune function, inflammation and degenerative disease. Our primary defense is the antioxidant nutrients in our diets,  especially  Vitamins  C  and  E. Life  Plus <A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS  BIO-COMPLEX</A>  contain  100% bioavailable, 100% residue-free and standardized OPC's from Dr. Masquelier's patented grape seed and pine bark extract. This great antioxidant product contains a full spectrum of OPC's, plus the valuable bioflavonoids quercetin, rutin, hesperidin, lemon bioflavonoids and vitamin C.  The OPC's are potent antioxidants in their own right, but also increase the effectiveness of others, such as Vitamin C and E contained in <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> and <A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> as well.

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLODYNE </H2>
<P>The soluble fibers and herbs contained in <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> help cleanse the lower intestine, especially the colon. They help ease conditions resulting from diets too low in fiber. Most leading advisory panels recommend that our diets contain a minimum of thirty grams of fiber per day which is accomplished by one heaping teaspoonful of <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A>. <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> helps to naturally cleanse and correct chronic constipation. This great product contains beneficial bacteria that live in the digestive tract and promotes colon hygiene, manufacture vitamins and helps maintain proper pH and control overgrowth of yeasts. It also absorbs toxins that arise from incomplete digestion or contaminated foods.  Studies show that people with high fiber diets are less likely to develop arteriosclerosis and colon cancer.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUSTENASE</H2>
<P> This great product employs a two phase release method that naturally assists the digestion of the foods we eat. This two phase method assists the stomach (phase I)and in the intestine (phase 2).  It helps to ensure that we receive the nutrients contained in our foods.  Proper digestion reduces stomach stress,  relieves  discomfort  from  overeating  and  aids  in preventing symptoms of improper digestion, such as gas, bloating, burping and heartburn.   In the stomach phase, <A HREF="msust.htm">SUSTENASE</A> helps maintain acid pi-I by supplying Betain HCI which activates the protein digesting enzyme, Pepsin. In its  intestinal  phase,  it  helps  maintain  a  more  alkaline  pH. Complete digestion of proteins is helpful in preventing food allergies. As a component of the SYNERGY PAK it is a basic product that everyone should have at every meal.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE Q-PAK</H2>
<P>The Life Plus maQ-PAK is more than just the basics. The six products that it contains are all important, leading products that provide many benefits. We recommend that you take them every day.<P>
Take 5 CARDIO-CHELEX, 2 MICRO-MINS, and 2 PROANTHENOLS BIO-COMPLEX in the morning with one heaping teaspoonful of  COLODYNE shaken in about 3 oz of your favorite juice.<P>
Take 3 SUPPORT TABS in the mid-afternoon and 1 SUSTENASE digestive aid at the beginning of each meal. 
<P>Each individual is different as far as their nutritional needs. You may change recommendation to better suit   your   needs, but begin with this recommendation. Add more of any of these products or others to your total health program as desired.

</TABLE>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM </H2>

<p>  We probably need more calcium and magnesium than any other vitamin or mineral because they are the primary building blocks of bones, teeth and muscles. Many foods contain these valuable minerals, especially calcium, so many people supplement their diets with calcium...yet calcium remains high on the list of minerals in which people are deficient.</P>
<P>  It is not how much calcium and magnesium you obtain from the foods you eat and supplements you take, but rather how much your body ABSORBS and UTILIZES. Very simply, calcium is difficult to absorb for most people.</P>
<P>  Life Plus understands that the name of the game is absorption and utilization; therefore, CALMAG PLUS is more than just a straight calcium supplement. It includes an abundant amount of magnesium and other specific nutrients your body needs in order to absorb and utilize both calcium and magnesium to its fullest potential. In taking CALMAG PLUS, you have a complete team working for you.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE CALMAG PLUS TEAM</H2>
<P>  Your body needs adequate amounts of magnesium in order to absorb calcium and it also needs adequate amounts of calcium to utilize magnesium. Vitamin D-3 is also included because it is necessary for both the absorption and utilization of calcium, and calcium is needed to utilize vitamin D-3. Any calcium supplement that does not contain calcium, magnesium and vitamin D is simply not of much value in terms of absorption and utilization in the body.</P>
<P>   Betaine HCI, glutaminic acid and the citrate form of calcium ensure that CALMAG PLUS is pH balanced. Proper pH (acid base balance) in the digestive tract is very important for proper calcium absorption.</P>
<P>   Alfalfa, Kelp and Dulce are also included as good sources of calcium and magnesium and all three are rich sources of trace minerals helpful for calcium and magnesium utilization. Boron is added to help maintain calcium levels in the body once it is absorbed. Studies have shown that less calcium is excreted in the urine if adequate levels of Boron are present.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TYPES OF CALCIUM & MAGNESIUM</H2>
<P>  Many calcium supplements contain only inexpensive, inorganic  forms  of  calcium,  such  as  oxides  or carbonates.  In general, most of these products are not worthwhile because most of the calcium is not absorbed. Different individuals seem to be able to absorb different forms of calcium and magnesium. This is why Life Plus CALMAG PLUS contains numerous sources of calcium and magnesium  including  citrates,  chelates,  aspartates, gluconates, ascorbates, glycerophosphates and lactates.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHY TAKE CALMAG PLUS?</H2>
<P>   Individuals who are allergic to dairy products (a major source of calcium in the American diet) can easily become deficient in calcium and need CALMAG PLUS to make up for the loss of this source of calcium.</P>
<P>  During pregnancy, mothers need a great deal of calcium and magnesium to ensure the proper development of the fetal bones, muscles and teeth and to ensure that the mother's own mineral stores are not depleted. For the same reason, lactating mothers should continue to supplement their diets with CALMAG PLUS.</P>
<P>   Growing children need extra calcium in their diets to ensure continuing development of muscles, bones and teeth. If they maintain proper levels of calcium, they will have less tendency toward cavities and broken bones.   CALMAG PLUS is the perfect supplement for them, but they may prefer the chewable Life Plus CANDY CAL tablet.</P>
<P>  Anyone who drinks large amounts of soft drinks need extra amounts of CALMAG PLUS, because of the leaching effects  of  the  ortho  phosphoric  acid. Carbonated, phosophorylated soft drinks are one cause of bone degeneration and the increased incidence of this problem has been shown to correspond to the increased consumption.</P>
<P>  Calcium and magnesium are absolutely necessary for healthy muscles.   Inadequate levels can lead to muscle cramping, especially in the legs.</P>
<P>   Elderly people find it increasingly difficult to absorb calcium and in general don't seem to get enough magnesium.    They often develop osteoporosis,  a condition  where  calcium  erodes  from  the  bones causing them to become weak and brittle. Elderly people should supplement their diets with Life Plus CALMAG PLUS.</P>
<P>  Calcium and magnesium are often called "Nature's Tranquilizers" because of their natural calmative effect, not only for muscles but for the nervous system as well.</P>

  <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  CALMAG PLUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of  numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE CALMAG PLUS</H2>
<P>  It is usually recommended that most people take three CALMAG PLUS tablets two times per day, usually with meals.  This supplies 1,000 mg each of both calcium and magnesium and represents 100% of the RDA for calcium and 250% for magnesium. Individual needs will vary. Older individuals and pregnant or lactating women should consider taking more.</P>


<BR><BR>
<P>Suggested Use:  Three tablets twice a day with meals provide 1,000 mg each of both calcium and magnesium.</P>

</TABLE>


 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CALCIUM </H2>

<P>  As far as sheer quantities are concerned, we probably need more calcium and magnesium than any other vitamin or mineral as they are the primary building blocks of bones, teeth and muscles. Many foods contain these valuable minerals, especially calcium.   Many people supplement their diets with calcium, yet calcium remains high on the list of minerals in which people are deficient.</P>
<P>  What really counts is not how much calcium and magnesium you obtain but rather how much your body ABSORBS and UTILIZES. Very simply, calcium is difficult to absorb for most people. Life Plus understands that the name of the game is absorption and utilization and therefore CANDY CAL is more than just a calcium supplement.  In addition, CANDY CAL contains the trace element Baron as it has been shown that adequate levels of Boron in our system reduces calcium excretion. Therefore, Boron helps ensure that calcium stores remain up to the levels needed once in the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TYPES OF CALCIUM & MAGNESIUM</H2>
<P> Many calcium supplements contain only inexpensive, inorganic forms of calcium, such as oxides or carbonates.  In general, most of these products are not worthwhile because most of the calcium is not absorbed. Furthermore, different individuals seem to be able to absorb different forms of calcium. This is why Life Plus CANDY CAL not only contains calcium carbonate for its antacid effect, but also provides additional calcium as PolyCalPlex, a Life Plus proprietary blend of high quality calcium sources including citrates, chelates, aspartates, gluconates, ascorbates, glycerophosphates and lactates.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHY TAKE CANDY CAL?</H2>
<P>   Individuals who are allergic to dairy products (a major source of calcium in the American diet) can become deficient in calcium and need to supplement with a reliable source of it.</P>
 <P> During pregnancy, mothers need a great deal of calcium  and  magnesium  to  ensure  the  proper development of the fetal bones, muscles and teeth and to ensure that the mother's own mineral stores are not depleted.  Lactating mothers should supplement with a reliable source of calcium.  Growing children need large adequate amounts of calcium in their diets to ensure continuing development of muscles, bones and teeth. If they maintain proper levels of calcium, they will have less tendency toward cavities or broken bones.  CANDY CAL  is  the  perfect  supplement for them, especially when used with <A HREF="msaurus.htm">VITA-SAURUS</A>.</P>
<P>  Anyone who drinks large amounts of soft drinks need extra calcium  because  of the leaching effects of orthophosphoric acid in these drinks.   Carbonated, phosphorylated soft drinks are one cause of bone degeneration.  The increased incidence of this problem has been  shown to correspond to the increased consumption of soft drinks.  Elderly people find it increasingly difficult to absorb calcium and don't seem to  get  enough  magnesium. They  often  develop "osteoporosis," a condition where calcium erodes from the bones, causing them to become weak and brittle. </P>
<P>  Calcium and magnesium are absolutely necessary for healthy muscles. Inadequate levels can lead to muscle cramping, especially in the legs. They are often called "Nature's Tranquilizers" because of their natural calmative effect, not only for muscles but for the nervous system as well.</P>
 <P>  It is obvious that both calcium and magnesium are not only essential but very important nutrients. Life Plus is well aware of this and provides different calcium and magnesium supplements. <A HREF="mmag.htm">MAGNESIUM PLUS</A> and <A HREF="mhydro.htm">HYDRO MAG</A> are designed for taking larger amounts of magnesium when desired. <A HREF="mcalmag.htm"> CALMAG PLUS</A> provides a unique one-to-one ratio of both for balanced supplementation.  Both calcium and magnesium are bulky and difficult to get larger quantities in tablets. CANDY CAL is designed with three goals in mind; 1) provide a good source of extra calcium, 2) can be used as an antacid when needed, and 3) formulated in a pleasant tasting chewable tablet that is easy to use for both children and adults.</P>


<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  CANDY CAL is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus Phytozyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE CANDY CAL</H2>
<P>  CANDY CAL can be used by those wanting only calcium supplementation. Chewing four tablets during the day provides 120% of the RDA. You can adjust your intake as desired. It can be chewed as an antacid as well when needed.</P>


 <P>
 Suggested Use:  Chew or swallow one or two tablets, two or more times a day as a good tasting calcium 
supplement. Also, use as a natural antacid.</P>

</TABLE>


 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MULTIPLE SOURCES </H2>

<P>  Different  individuals  absorb  various  kinds  of magnesium better than others.  The great Life Plus formula MAGNESIUM PLUS is formulated in such a way that it contains a unique combination of  various most active bio-available forms of magnesium.</P>
<P>  Over the past twenty years, a great deal of scientific data has been gathered about the importance of magnesium. Magnesium deficiencies result in excessive stress, high blood pressure, muscle cramps and spasms, fatigue,  restlessness,  irritability,  depression,  apathy, tremors, migraine headaches in pregnant women, asthma in young adults, severe tetanus and heart disease.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP</H2>
<P>  Calcium and magnesium experience a reciprocal relationship in every muscle of our body, including both the smooth muscles of the heart as well as the skeletal muscles, which give us strength. Calcium stimulates the muscles to contract and magnesium allows them to relax. When our bodies are deficient in calcium, we can borrow from the vast reserves in our bones.  However, when the body gets low on magnesium, we must obtain it from our muscles, which can result in depletion.</P>
<P>  As magnesium disappears from the muscles, calcium rushes in. Then, the muscles exhibit a tendency to tighten up and become tense, which the doctors call hypertonic. Many researchers now believe that this lack of magnesium may cause the muscles of the arterial and venous walls to contract, causing high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes.</P>
<P>  A prominent  researcher  has  found  that magnesium helps to prevent migraine headaches in pregnant women.  There is a tremendous demand for magnesium by the developing fetus. It has been estimated that these women only get 50 to 60 percent of the RDA of magnesium in their diets. Research has also shown that women experiencing PMS had lower levels of magnesium in their red blood cells and concluded that many premenstrual  symptoms  may  be  caused  by  a magnesium deficiency.</P>
<P>  We are inundated with large amounts of sodium in our diets. It is a hidden "nutrient" in almost all processed foods and we often don't even know it is there. Even though we need a small amount of sodium, excesses are known to contribute to atherosclerosis and high blood pressure. Research in Scandinavia has recently been published that proves the addition of magnesium to the diet can offset some of the damaging effects of sodium.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHY ARE WE DEFICIENT?</H2>
<P>  Just about every step in the chain of modern chemical farming and food processing depletes our source of magnesium. Chemical fertilizers used in agriculture today do not replace the lost magnesium. Unfortunately, nearly forty percent of the magnesium content of our foods leaches out when cooked.</P>
<P>   Some foods such as meat, ice cream and other "high fat" foods can cause a phenomenon known to scientists as "the magnesium trap."  These foods are low in magnesium themselves, but the primary problem is that they actually impair absorption of magnesium through the intestinal wall.
  Several medications, such as diuretics used in the treatment of high blood pressure, may cause the loss of magnesium from the body.  Studies have shown that individuals with a low serum magnesium level require a greater amount of anti-hypertensive drugs for the same degree of control of their blood pressure than those with normal magnesium levels.</P>
<P>  A  French  study  found  that  a  magnesium deficiency results in calcium deposits building up in the blood  vessels  as  well.    They  concluded  that magnesium deficiency may therefore contribute to the accumulation  of  fats  within  the  arterial  walls (atherosclerosis).   A  leading  researcher at  Howard University has found that people who have had a heart attack have low blood levels of magnesium.  Others have found that the heart muscle of those who have died from heart attacks have lower levels of magnesium than other muscles in their bodies.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  MAGNESIUM PLUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE MAGNESIUM PLUS</H2>
<P>  The usual recommended amount is one to two tablets one to three times per day. Four tablets per day provide 100% of the RDA for magnesium. MAGNESIUM PLUS is for people of all ages and is usually best taken with meals.  However, anytime is acceptable.   Some individuals experience a feeling of relaxation when they supplement with magnesium. This can be a benefit them as they can take it before bedtime to help them sleep naturally.</P>
<P>   Magnesium can also cause loose stools in some people as it brings water into the digestive track. If you notice this effect, simply stop taking it for two days and start back with just one tablet and increase as you can. Taking it with meals can also help. Most people don't notice this effect so don't be unduly concerned.</P>




 <P>
Suggested Use:  One or two tablets from one to three times per day.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMPORTANT NUTRIENT </H2>

<P>  Maintaining good levels of both calcium and magnesium is essential. They may be the most important nutrients required by man yet they are quite often deficient. In every muscle of our body, calcium and magnesium enjoy a reciprocal relationship.  Calcium stimulates the muscles to contract and magnesium helps them relax. When we are deficient in calcium, we can borrow from vast reserves in our bones, but when we get low in magnesium we obtain it from our muscles. As magnesium  disappears from the muscles, calcium rushes in and the muscles tend to become tense or cramp and we feel tired.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MULTIPLE SOURCES</H2>
<P>Different individuals  absorb different kinds of magnesium better than others. HYDRO MAG is formulated in such a way that it contains a unique combination of various, most highly bio-available forms of magnesium.</P>
<P>  Magnesium  deficiencies  result  in  excessive stress, high blood pressure, muscle cramps and spasms, fatigue, restlessness, irritability, depression, apathy, tremors, migraine headaches in pregnant women, asthma in young adults, severe tetanus and heart disease.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP</H2>
<P>  Many researchers believe a lack of magnesium may cause muscles of the arterial and venous walls to contract, causing high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes.</P>
<P>  A prominent researcher has found that magnesium helps to prevent migraine headaches in pregnant women. There is a tremendous demand for magnesium for the developing fetus. It has been estimated that these women only get 50 to 60 percent of the RDA of magnesium in their diets.  Research  has  also  shown  that  women experiencing PMS had lower levels of magnesium in their  red  blood  cells  and  concluded  that  many premenstrual symptoms may be caused by a magnesium deficiency.</P>
<P>We are inundated with large amounts of sodium in our diets.  It is a hidden "nutrient" in just about all processed foods, since many times we don't even know it is present. Even though we need a small amount of sodium, excesses are well known to contribute to atherosclerosis and high blood pressure.  Research in Scandinavia has recently been published that proves that the addition of magnesium to the diet can offset some of the damaging effects of sodium.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHY WE ARE DEFICIENT</H2>
<P>  Every step in the chain of modern chemical farming and food processing depletes our food of magnesium.  Chemical fertilizers used in agriculture today do not replace the lost magnesium. Unfortunately, nearly forty percent of the magnesium content of our foods leaches out when they are cooked.</P>
<P>  Some foods such as meat, ice cream and other "high fat" foods can cause a phenomenon known to scientists as "the magnesium trap."   These foods are low in magnesium themselves, but the primary problem is that they actually impair absorption of magnesium through the intestinal wall.</P>
<P>   Several medications such as certain diuretics used in the treatment of high blood pressure may cause the loss of magnesium from the body. Studies have shown that individuals with a low serum magnesium level required more anti-hypertensive drugs for the same degree of control of their blood pressure than those with normal magnesium levels. </P>
<P>  A French study found that magnesium deficiency results in calcium deposits building up in the blood vessels as well.   The researchers concluded that magnesium  deficiency  may  contribute  to  the accumulation  of fats  within  the  arterial  walls (atherosclerosis).   A leading researcher at Howard University has found that people who have had a heart attack have low blood levels of magnesium. Others have found that the heart muscle of those who have died from heart attacks have lower levels of magnesium in the heart than in other muscles in their bodies. Some foods high in magnesium include spinach, cabbage, tomatoes, bananas, and some fish such as salmon.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE HYDRO MAG</H2>
<P>  Dissolve contents of each 50 gm packet in 16 ounces of warm water and store in the refrigerator. The usual recommended amount is one or two tablespoonfuls per day.  One tablespoonful provides 100% of the RDA for magnesium. Some people seem to feel better when they take two or more.  Stir into three or four ounces of tomato or other vegetable juice. Most people prefer to take it at bedtime because they notice a natural relaxing effect.  Some individuals may notice loose stools when they take magnesium. If you do, simply stop taking it for two days and start back with one teaspoonful and build back up. It will usually go away when you adjust to it.</P>
<P>Both calcium and magnesium are very important. If you want to concentrate on calcium, you can take <A HREF="mcandy.htm">CANDY CAL</A>. If you want just magnesium. you can take <A HREF="mmag.htm">MAGNESIUM  PLUS Tablets </A> or HYDRO MAG Liquid.  If you want to take calcium and magnesium together, rely on <A HREF="mcalmag.htm">CALMAG PLUS</A>.

<p>Suggested Use: One or two tablespoonfuls once or twice a day, usually in water, tomato or vegetable juice depending on the amount of magnesium desired.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANTIOXIDANTS </H2>

 <P>  Until recent years, the primary role of vitamins and minerals was considered to be as organic molecules essential for normal metabolism and maintenance of tissues, and for preventing the well know deficiency diseases such as scurvy beriberi, pellagra and others.</P>
<P>  We now know that many of the vitamins and minerals such as vitamins A, E and C in the form of    Beta-Carotene, Selenium, Germaniurn, Vanadium and others have additional other important functions as well. They work as antioxidants or free radical scavengers.</P>
<P>  Scientists have found that vitamins A, C and E prevent certain types of cancer by blocking the formation of cancer causing substances in the body. Researchers are using these vitamins to prevent nitrates from turning into nitrosamines, one of the most researched and most recognized cancer causing substances today. Nitrites and nitrates routinely are found in processed, packaged meats, in the water we drink and even in cigarette smoke. It is now known that second-hand cigarette smoke is even more dangerous than if you had been smoking.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BETA-CAROTENE</H2>
<P>   Vitamin A and its precursor, Beta-Carotene, which exists in carrots, spinach and other vegetables fight the cancer causing effects of cigarette smoke.  In several studies it has been demonstrated that people who smoke stand a lower risk of developing lung cancer if they have diets high in vitamin A (BetaCarotene) containing foods. Beta-Carotene is not only a valuable antioxidant, but like vitamins C and E, it is an important nutrient in maintaining the immune system.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VITAMIN C</H2>
<P>  Thousands of articles have been written about the beneficial effects of vitamin C on health, especially in regard to the immune system and its antioxidant effect. It has been proven that vitamin C protects against the harmful effects of cigarette smoke and environmental pollution  such as automobile exhaust, industrial chemicals, bacterial toxins and other free radical causing agents.</P>
<P>  Like Beta-Carotene, vitamin C is very capable of protecting against nitrosamines.  These substances are produced in the stomach from nitrates and nitrites in such foods as hot dogs, bacon, luncheon meat and smoked fish. Many rural wells contain nitrates that have entered underground water supplies from the run off` of fertilizers and herbicides that have been applied to our agricultural lands.</P>

<P>  Next to Beta-Carotene and vitamin C, vitamin E has probably received the most attention.  Doctors Wilfrid and Evan Shute first showed years ago that vitamin E saved lives.  Vitamin E is classified as an antioxidant which protects our bodies when they are exposed to environmental pollutants that interfere with healthy oxygen metabolism.  It helps "preserve oxygen." Vitamin E is also known to be of special importance to the heart and reproductive organs in our bodies as well.</P>
 <P>  Because of industrial and automotive pollution, major cities can be hazardous to your health.  The FDA has determined that the toxicity of the ozone is comparable to phosgene, used in gas war-fare, and that .05 parts per million of ozone is dangerous.  Vitamin E blocks the damaging oxidation of healthy cells by this ozone and is therefore a natural defense.</P>
<P>  You may ask why Life Plus has PROTX II as a product when vitamin C, vitamin E and Beta-Carotene are in other products. Quite simply, it can be important to take more of these valuable antioxidants than ever before, as the need for them is growing every day. PROTX II is a convenient, single source of these valuable nutrients and a simple way to ensure you receive reasonable amounts every day. PROTX II is part of the Life Plus answer to living in the 20th century.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  PROTX II is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of  numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE PROTX II</H2>
<P>   Most individuals take one tablet twice a day with their multiple vitamin and mineral. Usually, this is adequate. If  you  are  experiencing  unusual  environmental conditions or a stressful lifestyle, more tablets can be taken.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBALS </H2>

<P>   Herbs have been used since creation to provide for the health and well being of entire civilizations. The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage. Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies. This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy. We probably never will understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits here and now.</P>
<P>  To the best of our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kind of herbal based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals.   These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, antioxidants, and at times, concentrated tissue nutrients when appropriate.  By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal based products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</H2>
<P>  Problems associated with the respiratory tract are among the most common health problems today. These maladies arise because of allergies, air pollution, smoking, infection, decreased immunity and poor nutrition, to name a few.</P>
<P>  Oxygen is the most important nutrient of all. The lungs pick up oxygen from the air we breath and expel carbon dioxide from the blood stream. Without adequate supplies of oxygen to the tissues, health simply cannot be maintained.  In our highly industrialized society, our lungs are exposed to much higher levels of pollutants than before. This excessive strain causes our lungs to become irritated, and they begin to malfunction or degenerate. When they do not function properly, lungs cannot absorb oxygen from the air efficiently to nourish our bodies.</P>
<P>  The major percentage of our population lives in large cities,  where  the  smog  and  air pollution  levels  are extremely high. If you live in Los Angeles, Denver, or Chicago, the pollution in the air you breath is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes per day. Keep in mind that even one puff of cigarette smoke supplies about one hundred billion anti-oxidant hits, and the first hit is on the cells of the lungs as air is inhaled. Tons of lead are put into our atmosphere every year from automobile exhaust. It is known that if you live within 500 feet of a busy highway, the lead levels in the air are more than 50 times higher than average.</P>
<P>  Anyone who has suffered from colds, cough, flu, bronchitis, asthma, or pneumonia knows what a blessing it is to have healthy lungs and proper breathing.</P>
<P>  Vitamin A deficiency can be one of the major reasons for lung deterioration. It is the most important nutrient that supports epithelia tissues including the lining of the lungs.  The Vitamin A in LUNG FORMULA is in the form of its natural plant source, Beta-Carotene. Life Plus LUNG FORMULA contains a representative amount to insure it is presented concurrently with the herbs in LUNG FORMULA. Larger amounts are intentionally not included to guard against obtaining too much Vitamin A from your overall nutritional supplement program.  More can easily be obtained by taking <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>, an ideal companion to LUNG FORMULA.</P>
<P>  LUNG FORMULA contains five natural herbs that have long been used because of their special nutritional values for the lungs. These herbs include Pleurisy Root, Slippery Elm, Fenugreek, Thyme and Yerba Santa. Smokers and individuals who live or work in large urban areas  should  consider  taking  Life  Plus  LUNG FORMULA.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  Life Plus LUNG FORMULA is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE LUNG FORMULA</H2>
<P>   It is usually recommended to take one or two tablets three times a day.   More can be taken if needed, especially in special times of need. For long term usage, it is recommended to take Life Plus LUNG FORMULA with additional sources of vitamin A, vitamin C, other antioxidants  and  enzymes.    This  can  best  be accomplished by taking <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>  , <A HREF="mprotx.htm">PROTX II</A> and <A HREF="msoma.htm">SOMAZYME</A>.</P>

 <P>
Suggested Use:  One or two tablets three times a day.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HEART DISEASE </H2>


 <P>  Heart and circulatory disease is the number one killer in America today.  Heart disease and strokes kill over a million people each year -- more than accidents, cancer, diabetes, pneumonia and influenza combined!</P>

<P>   The circulatory system is one of the most critical systems  in  the body  for our overall  health  It supplies all the organs and tissues with nutrients and carries away the waste products of metabolism. The heart and brain need enormous amounts of oxygen to function properly. Senility and heart disease (as often seen in older people) usually comes as a primary result of decreased circulation.</P>
<P>   Atherosclerosis is a condition of plaque build-up in the medium  and  larger  sized  arteries.  Research indicates that there must be some form of injury to the lining  and/or  muscle  tissue  of  the  arteries  for atherosclerosis to even begin.   Because free radicals definitely cause irritation, inflammation and cellular destruction, it is believed that they can cause injury to the walls of the arteries allowing plaque to begin building up. Therefore, supplementing with substances that counteract free radicals only makes sense.</P>
<P>  The liver produces a protein called fibrinogen.  It circulates in the blood and when it comes in contact with damaged or diseased tissue, it is changed into fibrin protein and sticks to the damaged tissue to form a clot. When free radicals cause injury to the lining of arteries, the fibrin protein sticks to the injured wall and forms a sticky net which traps cholesterol type compounds, heavy metals and other substances.  As the lining heals, the proteolytic enzymes in the blood are then supposed to break down the fibrin.    Individuals  who  have  a  lower  activity  of proteolytic enzymes have a great chance of developing excess blood clots and atherosclerosis.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANABOLIC AND CATABOLIC</H2>
<P>  CARDIO-CHELEX is the only product of its kind because it is catabolically balanced and contains proteolytic enzymes, plus natural chelating vitamins and amino acids. Recent innovative research shows that all metabolism (the chemical reactions in the body) fall into one of two categories:  (1) anabolic, or  building-up processes, and; (2) catabolic, or tearing down processes. The formation of a blood clot is an example of an anabolic process because it "builds" the clot. In time, the clot must be "broken down" (a catabolic process) by the proteolytic enzymes. If the body is too anabolic, the clots and plaque will remain and begin to accumulate.</P>
<P>   It has  been  shown that both  atherosclerosis  and hypertension are correlated with too much anabolic activity  which  builds  up  plaque  in  the  arteries. CARDIO-CHELEX contains many special nutrients that support catabolic activity. For this reason, several anabolic nutrients are intentionally not included  in CARDIO-CHELEX. CARDIO-CHELEX is not designed as a multiple vitamin like <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A>.   It is formulated with specific nutrients for specific effect. However, when taken in the morning and with Support Tabs  in the afternoon, you receive the value of a multiple type supplement as well as the advantage of the separate formulas.</P>
<P>   Prolonged stress causes the body to produce excess fatty acids and remain too catabolic. The body then reacts by producing excessive anabolic sterols like cholesterol, which can become trapped in the sticky fibrin on the cell walls.  One important reason exercise is so important in preventing cardiovascular disease is because it burns the excess fatty acids produced in reaction to stress, thus less anabolic sterols are produced in the body.  The special catabolically balanced nutrients in CARDIO-CHELEX, combined with a reasonable amount of exercise, is a winning combination in the prevention of heart disease.</P>
<P>  CARDIO-CHELEX contains over 47 special nutrients that work synergistically for the overall nutritional support of the circulatory and immune systems. They can be classified as (1) catabolic sulfur-containing amino acids, (2) proteolytic enzymes, (3) concentrated tissue nutrients, (4) vitamins, (5) minerals, (6) herbs, (7) natural chelating nutrients, (8) anti-oxidants, (9) free radical scavengers, and (10) immune stimulants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  CARDIO-CHELEX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE CARDIO-CHELEX</H2>
<P>   If you are under 40 and in relatively good health, five tablets once a day, first thing in the morning, is recommended. If you are over 40, or your family has a history of heart problems, or you have a special need, take 5 tablets twice a day, first thing in the morning and mid-day. Some individuals may notice an "uncomfortable feeling" at first when they begin taking CARDIO-CHELEX as it begins pulling pollutants and toxins out of the body. If this happens to you, wait two days and start again with one tablet daily for two days and then increase by one tablet every two or three days. Five tablets in the morning plus five tablets around mid-day is the ideal amount.  Certain nutrients are intentionally deleted for specific effect. Combined with <A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS</A> as in the <A HREF="mqpak.htm"> Life Plus QPAK</A> , you get the best of both worlds.  That is, you get the advantages of the specific effects of both products plus all the value of a multiple as well.</P>


 <P>
Suggested Use:  Five tablets once or twice a day preferably first thing in the morning and right before 
lunch</P>

</TABLE>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENZYME REACTIONS </H2>

<P>   There are thousands of different enzymes in our foods and in every cell of our bodies. Enzymes are needed to either initiate, accelerate or separate the distinct chemical reactions in the body. Without enzymes, most of the chemical reactions that make up our overall metabolism would never take place, let alone proceed efficiently in a healthy manner.  They are involved in anabolic reactions in the body that manufacture or "build up" substances. The end products can be other enzymes or hormones that the body uses to complete certain functions. Enzymes are also involved in our catabolic or "breaking down" reactions. All of these are natural processes and enzyme levels are critical to them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WE NEED ENZYMES</H2>
<P>   A quality diet containing a reasonable amount and variety of fresh, raw fruit and vegetables would supply our bodies with the enzymes it needs. However, most individuals do not eat this way and most enzymes are quickly destroyed when heated or cooked above 106"E  Since almost everyone exists on mostly cooked foods today, or to a great extent on processed foods, it would be wise to consider supplementing diets with SOMAZYME. Even our fresh raw foods of today cannot support us with the enzyme nutrition we need, because they are frown in mineral depleted soils and thus don't have the enzyme content of food grown early in this century.</P>
<P>  Our continued exposure to many enzyme inhibitors contributes to decreased enzyme activity in the body. The average person is exposed to many enzyme inhibitors daily such as fluoride and chlorine in public water supplies, copper from plumbing, etc. Even soybeans and certain other legume's contain anti-trypsin factors, which interfere with the pancreatic enzyme, Trypsin.</P>
<P>  These factors  may create a big  need for enzyme supplementation in the diet for some individuals. SOMAZYME provides a wide variety of the enzymes that support thousands of biochemical reactions involved in good health.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENZYME SOURCES</H2>
<P>  For maximum effect, the enzymes in SOMAZYME are obtained from both plant and animal sources. Pancreatin, Trypsin, Alpha-Chymotrypsin, Lysozyme and Super Oxide Dismutase are obtained from animal sources. They are present naturally in our bodies. Papayotin is obtained from papaya and Bromelain from pineapple. All of these enzymes are well known for their ability to breakdown proteins. Pancreatin also breakdown lipids (fat) as well. Even though the pancreas produces most of these enzymes, at times it may be stressed or unable to produce the quantities that may be needed for controlling many unwanted processes in the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FIBRIN PROTEIN</H2>
<P>   The single most important activity of these "proteolytic" enzymes (enzymes which break down proteins) is probably the natural role they play in the blood clotting mechanism. The liver produces a protein called "fibrinogen" and secretes it into the bloodstream.  When fibrinogen contacts damaged tissue, it is changed into a unique protein called "fibrin:' a large, sticky, insoluble protein molecule. When tissue is damaged, the fibrin molecules rush to the scene and begin the formation of a clot to prevent bleeding.  Soon after clots are formed, the proteolytic enzymes in the blood stream begin to break them down, so the tissue will not be damaged from extended lack of oxygen and nutrition due to impaired circulation over a period of time.</P>
<P>   Many of the enzymes in SOMAZYME, and in the diet as well, are produced in the body and break down this fibrin naturally. Excess fibrin proteins not broken down by proteolytic enzymes are a major component of plaque in the arteries. It is actually the main ingredient that lays down the foundation for the plaque and is the glue that holds it together.  In addition, cholesterol, fats, calcium compounds, heavy metals and other ingredients make up other parts of it. Plaque in the arteries leads to arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). With an adequate supply of proteolytic enzymes in the blood stream available to break down these fibrin proteins, there is less chance of plaque buildup.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> LYSOZYME</H2>
<P>   Lysozyme is an enzyme that is a component of every lung cell in our bodies.  It is in abundant supply in the fluids that are secreted from the eyes, nasal and sinus membranes, vagina, etc. It is a component of saliva and breast milk.  It is a very important substance in the control of infections as it enzymatically attacks invading bacterial and viruses. Large amounts of sugar in the diet can cause Lysozyme levels to decrease. Studies have shown that taking antibiotics can cause the lysozyme levels to decrease dramatically in the saliva of infants. The Lysozyme in SOMAZYME is formulated as Cytovex, which is a proprietary Life Plus enzyme base that ensures stability and consistency.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CO-FACTORS</H2>
<P>   Reliable sources of the minerals Magnesium, Manganese and Zinc are included in the SOMAZYME formula because they act as a co-enzyme in many enzyme-controlled chemical reactions in the body and assist enzyme activity. The valuable bioflavonoids, Rutin, Hesperidin  and Lemon Bioflavonoids are included for their nutritional value in maintaining the integrity of the circulatory system.  Certain amino acids and glutathione help ensure ideal enzyme activity. Buffering agents help protect the enzymes from stomach acids and because enzymes are extremely heat sensitive, all the ingredients are prepared by the cold processing method to preserve activity.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  SOMAZYME is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE SOMAZYME </H2>
<P>From one to five tablets are taken once, twice or three times per day, preferably on an empty stomach, away from meals as a systemic enzyme supplement for the whole body. Quite often, larger amounts are taken, particularly in short periods of need.
   SOMAZYME is a high quality enzyme supplement intended to be used by those who wish to increase their daily intake of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes.</P>


<P>Suggested Use: Take from one to five tablets, one to three times per day, preferably on an empty stomach away from meals as an enzyme supplement for the whole body. More can be taken if desired.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BEAUTIFUL IMAGE </H2>

<P>  SHAPE PLUS can help you achieve the "beautiful image" you have always desired. Combined with other Life Plus products, a sensible diet and a reasonable amount of exercise, SHAPE PLUS is helping thousands lose weight. Most importantly, they are keeping it off. It was developed by a biochemist who is well known for his understanding of lipid (fat) metabolism.  After much testing,  Life  Plus  decided  this  effective  herbal combination would make an exciting product to serve as an adjunct for individuals wanting to take a rational approach to weight management, not just a quick artificial, fad program.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW IT WORKS</H2>
<P>  SHAPE PLUS contains twenty-three different herbs and herbal extracts that contain higher levels of polyphenolic compounds.  It also contains 200 mcg of Chromium in the form of Chromium Picolinate. The polyphenols in these herbs are tannin related compounds and are somewhat astringent.  They have a natural appetite suppression action and help to reduce hunger if taken soon enough before hunger begins.</P>
<P>  These polyphenols are now becoming more well known in the literature and are generally considered to be some of the phytochemicals responsible for many health processes in the body.   They have a natural cleansing effect on the whole body and help the body detoxify as it is cleansed during weight loss.</P>
 <P> The herbs in SHAPE PLUS can reduce the amount of dietary fat absorbed into our bodies, thereby reducing calorie uptake from fat. They tie up fats naturally in the digestive tract making them less susceptible to digestion. The net result is that they are eliminated rather than absorbed.  They also help move food through the digestive tract at a more rapid pace, so that the extra "empty calories" do not linger and become absorbed.</P>
<P>  When fewer calories are absorbed, the body uses up its own fat for energy.   The natural appetite control provided by SHAPE PLUS is a blessing to those trying to control their eating habits.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CHROMIUM PICOLINATE</H2>
<P>  The Chromium Picolinate in SHAPE PLUS reduces the craving for sweets and helps the body maintain proper blood sugar levels. The typical energy ups and downs normally associated with dieting are greatly reduced. Not only individuals attempting to lose weight, but body builders and weight lifters take Chromium Picolinate as it supports the conversion of fat to lean body tissue. By having a greater percentage of lean body tissue to fat tissue, your metabolic consumption of calories is higher and it is easier to "burn more calories" every minute of every day. This, of course, makes it easier to keep those excess pounds off forever.</P>
<P>  The most well liked feature of  SHAPE PLUS is that it naturally reduces appetite. SHAPE PLUS can be taken anytime during the day. However, it must be taken at mealtime or when food is eaten to obtain its full benefit. People routinely loose five or more pounds per month.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROGRAMS</H2>
<P>  SHAPE PLUS can be used by itself or as part of any weight program.  When used as part of a total weight management, the best results are obtained. Always limit fats, processed foods and refined carbohydrates.   Use common sense when eating, and it will be easier to avoid unwanted calories while taking SHAPE PLUS.</P>
<P>  The ideal weight management program is to eat sensibly and take SHAPE PLUS with four other synergistic   Life   Plus   products, <A HREF="mendo.htm">  ENDOCRYN DHEA</A>, <A HREF="msupt.htm">SUPPORT TABS</A>, <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A> and <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A>. Take one heaping teaspoonful of COLODYNE in juice each morning, one or two ENDOCRYN DHEA tablets three times a day with meals, three SUPPORT TABS twice a day, and replace one or two meals a day with a PRO-MAX shake. Only eat fruits and vegetables between meals.

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  SHAPE PLUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them. </P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE SHAPE PLUS</H2>
<P>  It is best to take SHAPE PLUS between 15 and 30 minutes before each meal. If you get hungry, take it. Between two and four tablets are usually taken before meals and one with light snacks. Be consistent and take SHAPE PLUS every time you eat. Carry some tablets with you at all times, so that you have them whenever you decide to snack or "eat out".</P>


<BR><BR 
<P>
Suggested Use:  Two to four tablets at least three times a day prior to each meal.  One tablet should be 
taken if  light snacks are eaten.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROTEIN ASSURANCE </H2>

<P>  PRO-MAX is a highly nutritious supplement that provides the daily requirements of protein for lasting energy while at the same time supplying complex carbohydrates for more immediate energy.  Because of the combination of both high quality protein and high quality complex carbohydrate, PRO-MAX is particularly suitable for use by athletes and those with high energy expenditure requirements.  PRO-MAX, especially when taken with <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TMV-49</A>, is also suitable as a meal replacement for individuals on calorie restricted diets. It is  ideal  for  adding  to  milk, juices  or  other  foods, fortifying them with protein and complex carbohydrate. At the same time, it is relatively fat free and ensures adequate levels of high quality protein while minimizing fat intake. Because PRO-MAX is so easily digested, it is also excellent for fulfilling the nutrition requirements of both children and elderly individuals who have a tendency to not eat as they should.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SOY & DAIRY FREE</H2>
<P>  PRO-MAX is an unusual blend of natural plant source protein and complex carbohydrate that is both dairy and soy free.  The high quality protein in PRO-MAX is obtained from natural Legume concentrates (Pisum Sativum) vegetable sources.  It can be used freely by those individuals who have dairy and/or soy allergies. Plus, it is much better tasting than soy-based products.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PRO-MAX IS SPECIAL</H2>
<P>  Life Plus developed PRO-MAX to represent the state-of-the-art in protein supplements. We chose not to use any soy, milk or hydrolyzed protein. We were able to identify an excellent source of high quality vegetable protein, extracted for us from certain yellow peas under carefully controlled and monitored conditions.   It contains a high percentage of essential amino acids.</P>
 <P>  All proteins are not created equal. Different proteins contain various amounts of essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are those that the body cannot manufacture itself so they must be contained in the diet. PRO-MAX, with its high percentage of essential amino acids, is a leading product in its category. The P.E.R. or Protein Efficiency Ratio is a number that describes the quality of proteins. PRO-MAX has a very high P.E.R. of 2.7. Actually, PRO-MAX can supply the body's entire need for protein if enough were taken.</P>
<P>  PRO-MAX also contains complex carbohydrates, those  that  scientists  refer  to  asamylaceous polysaccharides, from specially grown barley processed in such a way as to protect its other beneficial natural ingredients.  The inclusion of thirty percent complex carbohydrate in this great product is consistent with current research. This research demonstrates that excess protein on its own may have adverse effects, especially in the case of persons who have any tendency towards hypoglycemia.  The benefits of protein/carbohydrate combinations are becoming well established.   In addition, PRO-MAX contains good, soluble dietary fiber and provides substantial quantities of natural vitamins and minerals from the specially grown barley.</P>
<P>  PRO-MAX is pleasantly palatable. It has a pleasant, somewhat bland taste which is superior to other protein powders. Therefore, PRO-MAX is the finest and most versatile protein supplement in both palatability and composition. It is useful for fast energy and for building up energy reserves for people of all ages.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  PRO-MAX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE PRO-MAX</H2>
 <P> PRO-MAX is intended to be used in the form of a drink, although it can be used as an ingredient, which can be added to flour, baked goods and other cooked products. It can also be added to prepared foods such as dips, soups, sauces and gravies. For those wishing to gain weight we recommend that it be taken in the form of a shake at meal times in addition to your regular food. In the  case  of  athletes,  take  in  water  or juice approximately one hour before exercise.  As a meal replacement, use two or three heaping tablespoonfuls in skim milk or your favorite juice in place of the meal.</P>



 
<P>
Suggested Use:  Mix two to four heaping tablespoons in liquid as a high energy quality protein drink . It 
can be used between meals or before or after exercise.</P>

It is also suitable as a meal replacement  for individuals on calorie restricted diets, although <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A> is usually used for this purpose. On the other hand, PRO-MAX 100 is usually preferred as the supplement of choice for fortifying foods and drinks by persons who want to ensure they are getting plenty of protein in their diet. It is great to use for low fat diets as well because PRO-MAX 100 is virtually fat free and easily digested.  Both of these products are excellent for fulfilling the nutrition requirements of children and for the elderly as it is easily digested.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PRO-MAX 100 IS SPECIAL</H2>
<P> Life Plus developed <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX </A> and PRO-MAX 100 to represent state-of-the-art in protein supplements. We chose not to use any soy, milk or hydrolyzed protein.

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?</H2>
<P> The only difference between <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A> and PRO-MAX 100 is that PRO-MAX 100 does not contain the complex carbohydrates and fiber that are present in <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A>. PRO-MAX 100 contains 100% protein whereas <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX </A> contains 70% protein and 30% complex carbohydrate. Any given amount of PRO-MAX 100 contains 1.43 times the amount of protein than <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A>. PRO-MAX 100 is for those individuals who, for one reason or another, wish to obtain their carbohydrate from other sources. While <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX </A> is more nutritionally complete, carbohydrate-sensitive individuals may prefer PRO-MAX 100.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SPECIFIC SUPPORT </H2>

<P>  SUPPORT TABS is one of the leading Life Plus products.  The original research this great formula is based on was completed at Rutgers University. The goal was to understand specific support needed by alcoholics because of the damage done to specific organs in their bodies by the excessive use of alcohol.</P>
<P>   Alcoholics are all hypoglycemic, a condition that is characterized by wide and varied blood sugar levels. Millions of Americans are affected by this condition to some degree. Our blood sugar levels fluctuate normally within a limited range, but problems can develop if those levels change too rapidly or if they get too high or too low.  When they are too high for extended periods of time, diabetes is the result. If the levels become too low, a condition known as hypoglycemia can cause problems.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS</H2>
<P>  Carbohydrates   stimulate   the   pancreas   to produce insulin. Insulin transfers sugar out of the blood into the cells, where it is used for energy. The chronic eating of too much refined carbohydrate such as sugar over-sensitizes the pancreas and after a time it begins to over react to sugar in the diet.  The pancreas then produces too much insulin and blood sugar levels fall too low.   People then get the "blahs" and eat more sugar-containing foods to overcome the slump.  The pancreas over reacts again with too much insulin and the "blahs" strike again.   This condition is called hypoglycemia.</P>
<P>  The  cycle  continues  until  eventually  the pancreas  becomes  exhausted  and  can  hardly produce any insulin at all. This condition then becomes diabetes.</P>
<P>  The adrenal glands also stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin. Caffeine and nicotine stress out and exhaust the adrenals in a similar way. This aggravates hypoglycemia just like eating too much sugar.</P>
<P>  SUPPORT TABS nutritionally support the pancreas, pituitary, liver, adrenals, hypothalamus and the whole body as well. The hypothalamus has long been known to be involved in most habit forming processes in the body and needs special nutritional support when trying to break habits.</P>
 <P> Much research has been done more recently at MIT on "carbohydrate hunger."  They have proven that Seratonin production in the brain is increased when increased levels of the amino acid, L-Tryptophan, get
into the brain. When enough Seratonin is produced, carbohydrate hunger increases.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AMINO ACIDS</H2>
<P>  SUPPORT TABS contain amino acids associated with the metabolic pathways of L-Tryptophan in the brain. Even though most people notice an energy boost when they take SUPPORT TABS, about 3% notice a feeling of relaxation, rather than increased energy.  A reaction of this type should be considered positive.</P>
<P>  L-Glutamine is considered to be helpful in mental alertness.   Vitamins B-l, B-2 and B-6 are included because they assist in the burning of glucose, which produces energy. However, the typical large amounts of B-vitamins, usually contained in stress formulas, are intentionally not included in SUPPORT TABS as they would cause the body to burn too much blood sugar quickly.   Mega-doses of B-vitamins give temporary energy, but once the sugar is burned, the same hypoglycemic "blahs" return in full force.  Thus, SUPPORT TABS contain a reasonable amount of B-vitamins to support the process naturally without creating a false stimulant effect that ultimately does more harm than good.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  SUPPORT TABS are formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE THEM</H2>
<P>   It  is  difficult to  say  exactly  how  one  should  take SUPPORT TABS as we all have different needs at different times. For best results, we recommend that you experiment.  Take at least three tablets per day. The general recommendation is three tablets two times per day, usually three early to mid afternoon and three in the late afternoon or evening.   Some people also prefer taking them in the morning. An ideal regimen is to take<A HREF="mcardio.htm"> CARDIO-CHELEX</A>  in the morning and SUPPORT TABS in the afternoon.</P>


<P>
Suggested Use:  Three tablets once or twice a day for energy and to fight stress or when trying to break 
habits such as overeating, smoking, etc. They are also useful in athletic programs.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FIBER IS IMPORTANT </H2>

<P>  Most people should begin a nutritional program with COLODYNE. A great majority of people have a sluggish digestive tract and would absorb many more nutrients if they had the good digestive tract hygiene provided by COLODYNE.</P>
 <P> Because of modern junk food diets, lack of vigorous exercise and the lack of adequate fiber in the diet, most people's colons are not healthy.  When partially digested food remains in the colon too long it decays. Little pockets form in the colon, called diverticulae, which trap this decaying food and spawn harmful bacteria action. This often leads to serious infection and inflammation called diverticulitis. Many physicians believe that the toxic by-products of this decaying debris may actually be a major cause of colon and other cancers.  It is imperative that these pockets be emptied and cleansed of any mucous build-up to avoid inflammation and infection. Fiber is the main dietary ingredient to accomplish this.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW COLODYNE WORKS</H2>
<P>  COLODYNE is an easy way to get a reasonable amount of fiber quickly. Its bulk helps promote good healthy muscle tone for the muscles of the colon wall. The Black Walnut, Beet Root, Papaya and Bromelain enzymes in COLODYNE help loosen the mucous build-up from the colon walls so it can be eliminated. Do not be alarmed if you pass strings of mucous after using COLODYNE for a couple of weeks as this is a good sign that you are detoxifying.</P>
 <P>  If you set aside three days each month to  eat only raw fruit and drink juices plus take COLODYNE three times per day in juice, you will give your colon a good opportunity to cleanse itself routinely. You will be surprised how good you will feel.</P>
<P> COLODYNE also contains Lactobacillus Salivarius, Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Lactobacillus Bulgaricus and Lactobacillus Bifidus for beneficial bacteria that live in a healthy colon environment. These bacteria help in the synthesis of certain B vitamins, maintain proper colon pH, maintain normal consistency of stool and fight off` viruses, yeasts and harmful bacteria.</P>
<P>  COLODYNE also contains powdered Bentonite, a natural, high-quality clay that absorbs many toxins so they can be naturally eliminated.  Alginate is a sea weed substance that absorbs many toxic metals, especially aluminum, which is normally difficult for the body to eliminate.  Because aluminum cooking utensils have been so popular, aluminum toxicity is more widespread than recognized.  It can lead to depression   and   psychoses  and  be very damaging to heart muscle.</P>
<P>  The liver attempts to eliminate aluminum by incorporating it into the bile.   However, bile is ultimately secreted into the intestinal tract and most of the aluminum is reabsorbed. Alginate very efficiently holds the aluminum in the digestive tract so it can be eliminated through the stool.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  COLODYNE is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE COLODYNE</H2>
<P>  We recommend that COLODYNE be taken either in the morning right before breakfast or in the evening. Usually, one heaping teaspoonful, which provides 13 grams  of high  quality  soluble  fiber,  is  the recommended amount once a day. It is a good idea to take it twice a day for the first week or ten days.
  Place  one  to  two  heaping  teaspoonfuls  of  COLODYNE in a small jar or glass (with a lid) with three to four ounces of your favorite juice.  Usually, apple or orange juice is best. Shake briskly for about ten seconds and drink immediately. Do not let it stand after mixing as it will gel quickly and be difficult to swallow.  We recommend following with water or more juice to ensure adequate liquid. Use the extra liquid to remove  any remaining COLODYNE that may stick to the container. You may notice increased gas for a few days as you go through the initial phase of cleansing.</P>

 <P>
 Suggested Use:  Take one or two heaping teaspoons mixed in water or juice once or twice a day as a 
fiber and bulk supplement. Shake vigorously and drink immediately.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBALS </H2>

<P>  Herbs  have  been  used  since  creation  to provide for our health and well being, for entire civilizations for that matter.  The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage.  Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies.  This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy.   We probably never will understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits now.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge,  Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals.   These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and, at times, concentrated tissue nutrients.   By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal based products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FLUID RETENTION</H2>
<P>  Consistent  use of DIUPLEX  may  result  in frequent elimination of water from the body. When the tissues retain too much water, it can create hydrostatic pressure that works against the blood vessels making it harder for efficient circulation to occur. This can cause elevated blood pressure and be an increased work load on the heart.</P>
<P>  For efficient weight loss to occur, the constant flushing of water from the body is necessary. Adepoise (fat) tissue retains water and its reduction naturally assists excess water elimination. This is a natural and beneficial cleansing action that can be supported by taking DIUPLEX while dieting.</P>
<P>  The kidneys do not actually eliminate water but they do eliminate sodium. When the sodium is transported by the kidneys, it is followed by water and thus diuresis occurs.</P>
<P>  However, because potassium is chemically very similar to sodium in certain ways, the kidneys sometimes perceive potassium to be sodium and it is eliminated instead of the sodium.  When excess potassium is eliminated, a feeling of tiredness is often experienced. Quite often, doctors prescribe high powered potassium salts to counteract this.  Then, they often discover that potassium products that are commonly used have a tendency to irritate the digestive tract and can actually go so far as to cause duodenal ulcers.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE DIUPLEX DIFFERENCE</H2>
<P>  The Life Plus DIUPLEX formula contains a small amount of potassium in each tablet. The small amount is not enough to cause any irritation to the intestines but it can help prevent possible depletion of potassium from the body due to the elimination of water. In addition, the potassium in DIUPLEX is in the form of a chelate, which is much more gentle on the digestive tract.</P>
<P>   A full 50 mg of Vitamin B-6 is included because of its natural diuretic effect when taken in this quantity. However, it should be taken with magnesium for best results.</P>
<P>  DIUPLEX also contains six different herbs including Buchu Leaves, Couch Grass, Corn Silk, Hydrangia Root, Uva Ursi and Peppermint. These herbs have been used for many years for their natural diuretic effect. This well liked product does not produce a strong "drug-like" effect that can be associated with unwanted side effects.  Instead, it provides a gentle, yet reliable diuretic effect.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  DIUPLEX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of  numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE DIUPLEX</H2>
<P>  Since DIUPLEX is not a drug, but a natural product, some individuals need to take several tablets to notice its effect.  However, it is usually recommended that two to three tablets be taken in the morning and at mid-day. It is not wise to take it in the afternoon as its diuretic effect may carry over for several hours into the night, which could interfere with restful sleep.</P>

 <P>
 Suggested Use:  Two or three tablets, once or twice a day, in the morning, not after mid-day.</P>

<BR><BR><BR>
<H1>WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PAK: Effective, Easy Weight Loss Program</H1>
<BR>
<HR>

<BR><BR> 
<H3>Each Pak Contains:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>16   oz.        PRO-MAX</LI>
<LI>25   oz.        COLODYNE</LI>
<LI>90   Tablets  ENDOCRYN DHEA</LI>
<LI>180 Tablets  SUPPORT TABS</LI>
<LI>180 Tablets  SHAPE PLUS</LI>
</UL>
<BR><BR>




 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> QUALITY NUTRITION </H2>

 </P>The Life Plus WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PAK is a weight control program that is easy to use, yet extremely effective, especially when combined with a low fat diet and a reasonable program of regular exercise. The program consist of five great Life Plus products that are very synergistic when used together in the support of total weight management.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PRO-MAX</H2>
<P><A HREF="mpromax.htm"> PRO-MAX </A>is an unusual blend of natural plant source protein and complex carbohydrate. It contains high quality, soy-free protein from natural concentrated legume vegetable sources with a high P.E.R. (Protein Efficiency Ratio).  This ensures a high ratio of all eight essential amino acids.  It also contains a scientifically determined thirty percent complex carbohydrate from barley malt extract which contains many vitamins, minerals, micronutrients, enzymes and high quality soluble fiber.  PRO-MAX is both dairy and soy free, so persons with dairy and soy allergies can use it.  The taste of PRO-MAX is more pleasant than soy-based products. PRO-MAX was first developed to supply protein, carbohydrate and energy for athletes. In addition, it can be used as a low-calorie meal replacement when dieting, or as an excellent supplement in addition to regular meals.</P>
<P>   PRO-MAX is a highly nutritious supplement that provides the daily requirements of protein for lasting energy, while at the same time supplying complex carbohydrates for more immediate energy. Because of the combination of both high quality protein and high quality complex carbohydrate, PRO-MAX is particularly suitable for use by athletes and others with high energy expenditure requirements. PRO-MAX, especially when taken with <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A>, is also suitable as a meal replacement for individuals on calorie-restricted diets. It is ideal for adding to milk, juices or other foods, fortifying them with protein and complex carbohydrate. At the same time, it is relatively fat free and ensures adequate levels of high quality protein while minimizing fat  intake. Because  PRO-MAX  is  so  easily  digested,  it  is  also excellent for fulfilling the nutrition requirements of both children and elderly individuals who have a tendency to not eat as they should.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLODYNE</H2>
<P><A HREF="mcolodyn.htm"> COLODYNE</A> provides the much needed fiber and bulk in today's diet. The various fibers and herbs in COLODYNE help cleanse the lower intestine, especially the colon.  It helps to ease existing conditions resulting from a diet too low in fiber.   Because COLODYNE supplies bulk. it also helps correct chronic constipation. COLODYNE contains beneficial bacteria that normally live in the lower digestive tract, which promote proper colon hygiene. They also manufacture certain vitamins, help maintain proper pH and control overgrowth of infectious yeasts such as candida albicans. The fiber and betonite absorb toxins in the digestive tract that can arise from incomplete digestion or from contaminated foods in the diet. COLODYNE helps with the elimination of excessive mucous build-up that can occur in the colon from eating low fiber diets. This mucous build-up can harbor unfriendly bacteria and restrict absorption of needed nutrients.  Studies have shown that people with diets higher in natural fiber are less likely to develop arteriosclerosis and colon cancer.  It contains natural fiber, herbs and beneficial micro-flora that help maintain a healthy colon.</P>
<P>   COLODYNE is an easy way to get a reasonable amount of fiber quickly.  Its bulk helps promote good healthy muscle tone for the muscles of the colon wall. The Black Walnut, Beet Root, Papaya and Bromelain enzymes in COLODYNE help loosen the mucous build-up from the colon walls so it can be eliminated.  Do not be alarmed if you pass strings of mucous after using COLODYNE for a couple of weeks as this is actually a good sign that you are detoxifying.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENDOCRYN DHEA</H2>
<P><A HREF="mendo.htm">ENDOCRYN DHEA</A> contains 30 mg of real DHEA along with a highly concentrated and standardized blend of Mexican and Asian varieties of Dioscorea (Wild Yam). Dioscorea contains natural substances that serve as precursors for the body's endocrine system to manufacture its own DHEA. DHEA is used by our bodies to produce at lease 50 other hormones that are important in overall health. DHEA levels decrease as we age. One of the most exciting benefits of DHEA is its ability to burn fat and help you lose weight, plus keep it off by converting fat to muscle.</P>
<P>   DHEA's ability to facilitate this burning of fat may became one of the most significant finds in weight control. This effect does not seem to be so diet dependent as are other weight control supplements. No matter what you eat, DHEA still provides benefits of weight loss.</P>
<P>  DHEA's  ability  to  block  an  enzyme  named  G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase) may be one of the most significant finds of the century. This enzyme is not only essential for fat tissue but also promotes cancer cell growth.  By blocking it, DHEA's action of reducing body fat and helping to prevent against cancer may be explained.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUPPORT TABS</H2>
<P> The amino acids, concentrated tissue nutrients, specific vitamins and minerals in <A HREF="msupt.htm">SUPPORT TABS</A> serve as fuel for the nervous system to provide energy, but also create a natural calming effect. They help greatly to maintain more consistent blood sugar levels helping the body maintain energy levels and control the ups and downs associated with low blood sugar levels. SUPPORT TABS are great for high stress situations such as those dieting, smokers or those trying to stop smoking, those trying to get off mind-altering drugs, heavy caffeine ingestion from coffee, chocolate or soft drinks, busy executives, students, people who travel a lot and individuals who seem to always be on the run. Many people have great results with SUPPORT TABS in helping them control excessive appetite and cravings.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SHAPE PLUS</H2>
<P><A HREF="mshape.htm"> SHAPE PLUS</A> is a unique herbal-based product that contains 23 different herbs selected for their high content of naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds.  These polyphenols have an astringent effect on the stomach and act as natural appetite suppressants. They are natural cleansing or detoxifying agents for both the digestive tract and throughout the whole body. These herbs, because of the natural polyphenols they contain, can reduce the amount of fat that is absorbed, thereby reducing calories.  They also help move food through the digestive tract at a normal rate, so those extra "empty calories" do not linger and become absorbed. When fewer calories are absorbed, the body will use up its own fat for energy.  The natural appetite control provided by SHAPE PLUS is a blessing to those trying to control their eating habits. The Chromiurn Picolinate in SHAPE PLUS reduces the craving for sweets and helps the body maintain proper blood sugar levels so the typical energy level ups and downs normally associated with dieting are greatly reduced. Chromium Picolinate also supports the conversion of fat to lean body tissue.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE THE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PAK </H2>
<P>Mix two or more heaping tablespoonfuls of PRO-MAX and one heaping teaspoonful of COLODYNE in juice or skim milk as a meal replacement twice a day.  Take two SUPPORT TABS and one ENDOCRYN DHEA three times a day with meals. Take two or more SHAPE PLUS before meals and snacks.</P>

<H2>Yet, every year, mankind destroys an area of rainforest nearly one-half the size of Texas. </H2>
<BR>
<P>Earth's greatest natural resource is quite literally going up in smoke, as over 320 square miles of irreplaceable primary rainforest are burned or logged <I>every day</I>. Only twenty years ago, rainforests covered about fourteen percent of the earth's land area. Today, rainforests are less than six percent.</P>
<P>At the current rate of destruction, this miraculous web of life will be totally wiped out in forty years. With it will be lost untold treasures and irreplaceable resources available only within these unique environments.</P>
<P>The importance of these fragile eco-systems to the health of our world cannot be overstated:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Over half of Earth's living species live there.</LI>
<LI>Two-and-a-half acres of Amazon Rainforest contain over seven hundred-fifty types of trees, more than all of North America.</LI>
<LI>One rainforest reserve in Peru is home to more species of birds than the entire United States.</LI>
<LI>According to estimates, twenty percent of the world's oxygen is produced in the Amazon Rainforest.</LI>
<LI>Two-thirds of the Earth's fresh water is found in the Amazon River basin.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Perhaps even more distressing is the loss of countless ingredients that could provide improved health and a better life for millions of people throughout the entire world:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Seventy percent of the plants currently found to be active against cancers come from the rainforests.</LI>
<LI>Over one hundred and twenty prescription drugs and twenty-five percent of all pharmaceuticals originate from rainforest material.</LI>
<LI>Eighty percent of all fruits ad vegetables in our modern diet originated there.</LI>
<LI>And yet, the rainforest is so rich with life, <I>less than one percent of its three hundred thousand plant species have even been studied by scientists.</I></LI>
<LI>One rainforest plant, the Madagascar Periwinkle (now extinct in the wild), has produced a drug that has increased the survival rate in children with leukemia from 20% to 80%. How many lives have been saved by this one plant? How many more can be saved by other plants that grow in the rainforests?</LI>
</UL>
<P>A seemingly endless list of fact after fact present the importance of saving the world's remaining rainforests. If we act today, the world we pass on to our children's children can be a healthier, better world for all.</P>
<H2>The RainForce, providing a force for a healthier world. </H2>
<P>The key to turning this tide of destruction lies in providing  long-term, economically viable alternatives to the current exploitation of the rainforest by timber companies, oil companies, agra-business and others. Sustainable, non-destructive harvesting of the riches contained in the rainforests of the world is vital to the on-going health of our world.</P>
<P>Not only is it environmentally sound, but sustainable harvesting of rainforest plants makes more economic sense than the alternatives. It is estimated that sustainable harvesting of one acre of Peruvian Amazon rainforest can produce over $2400 annually for the Peruvian people. In contrast, clear-cutting for timber nets only $400 per acre and cattle grazing earns only $60 per acre.</P>
<H2>A Complex Problem</H2>
<P>Like many of the world's problems, rainforest deforestation is a complex problem. Yet, in reality, the solution is simple. If you and enough people like you, show concern and start to take positive actions, change will occur. In this case, it is as simple as using, and encouraging others to use, products that have been sustainably harvested from these endangered rainforests of the world.</P>
<H2>The RainForce, A Solution</H2>
<P>Life Plus is proud to introduce the RainForce. As a catalyst for progressive change, it encompasses people and organizations working towards a healthier planet. The moral imperative we all should feel to leave the world a little better than it was when we arrive is an underlying concept of the RainForce. Truly, the RainForce is many things:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Life Plus Members using products, and telling others about these products that are sustainably harvested from the unique web of life, are part of the RainForce.</LI>
<LI>Indigenous peoples of the rainforest areas earning a livable income from non-destructively harvesting the fruits of the forest are part of the RainForce.</LI>
<LI>Life Plus, working together with the indigenous peoples of the rainforest and utilizing sustainably harvested botanicals from the rainforest in its new product line, is part of the RainForce.</LI>
<LI>Consumers through-out the world, seeking products that are sustainably harvested from the rainforest are part of the RainForce.</LI>
<LI>Most importantly, <B>YOU</B> are part of the RainForce.</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Joining Is Easy</H2>
<P>There are no membership dues. No forms to fill out. When you order Life Plus RainForce products, you become a member of the RainForce. When you tell your friends about these products, or talk about how we can change this cycle of destruction; you are a member of the RainForce.</P>
<H2>Will It Work?</H2>
<P>Yes. The <B>only</B> way to save the world's remaining rainforests is to provide an alternative that offers the local people and local governments an economic solution that is better than  the current destructive exploitation.</P>
<P>Life Plus firmly believes that the biggest problems we face, now or in the future, can best be solved through individual effort. When millions of people, each one making an individual effort to contribute, are all working toward the same goal - <I>the world changes!</I></P>
<H2>The Life Plus Difference</H2>
<P>Life Plus is proud of the RainForce. We think that it <B>WILL</B> make a positive difference. Both for the future health of the world's remaining rainforests and in the lives of all of those who join us in this effort. We know the power and determination of the Life Plus Members. We know the strength of the RainForce products.</P>
<P>Making a positive difference in people's lives is nothing new for Life Plus and our Members. It is the fundamental concept behind our business. Life Plus is dedicated to providing our Members with a life of better health. A life of financial opportunity and prosperity. 
A life of self-empowerment.</P>
<P>Now Life Plus and the RainForce are dedicated to making the world a healthier place to live.</P>
<H2>The Pharmacy of the World</H2>
<P>To the people who have lived in the rainforest for thousands of years, it is a sacred place. A place of life. A place of health. Through countless generations, these indigenous peoples of the rainforest have learned many of the health secrets hidden within dense vegetation, utilizing over eighteen-hundred species of plants for medicinal and health purposes.</P>
<P>Life Plus has tapped this ancient wisdom in developing the RainForce product line. Studying with indigenous Amazon healers and integrating this age-old knowledge with the advanced technology and product application expertise that is he hallmark of Life Plus; we developed the RainForce product line. A line of healthful products combining the best of both worlds.</P>
<P>Utilizing some twenty-five rainforest plants in these formulation, Life Plus uses costly <I>cold-processing</I> techniques, without chemical agents to refine and concentrate active ingredients as standardized whole complexes, complete with all the naturally occurring enzymes and other phytonutrients that create their synergistic effectiveness.</P>
<P>The result? Health enhancing products that capture the complex, symbiotic life force of the rainforest itself. Products that can enhance your health in ways that now synthetic product can match. Products that reward indigenous peoples and promote sustainable harvesting of precious rainforest botanicals:</P>

<P>Life Plus RainForce products: <I>combining the wisdom of traditional rainforest healing with the benefits of modern science and technology. </I><P> 
Life Plus RainForce products: <I>using sustainable harvesting of rainforest botanicals to enhance your health, and the health of our planet.</I></P>
<HR SIZE=10>
<P>Life Plus is committed to preserving the world's rainforests for the generations to come. We are determined that we should not only help build a market for rainforest products, but also contribute directly, on a sustained basis, to organizations devoted to the same cause.</P>
<P>Life Plus is dedicating a portion of all sales of <B>any product we develop from rainforest materials</B> to be donated to non-profit organizations actively and directly working in the local communities to preserve rainforest.</P>
<P>Special emphasis will be given to programs that:</P
<UL>
<LI>Increase and enhance the educational opportunities for the local population.</LI>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING SKIN </H2>

 <P>  Premature aging of the skin due to excessive exposure to sunlight is an increasing problem across the world today.   It is characterized by thinning of the skin, wrinkles, yellowing, mottling and leathery dryness. It can easily lead to skin cancers of all types.  Photodamaged skin actually undergoes structural changes, along with the simultaneous loss of collagen and elastin. This loss causes less resilience in the skin making it appear aged.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MARINE CONCENTRATE</H2>
<P>  The unique marine concentrated extracts contained in FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS are obtained from certain cold water fish.  These have been shown to provide special nutrients that support both collagen and elastin production in the body and Lit the same time help protect them from destructive ultraviolet light and enzymes. This specific concentrated extract is made up of over 50% polysaccharide and 30% protein.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> OTHER NUTRIENTS</H2>
<P>  Other synergistic nutrients are included in FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS to help support healthy, vibrant skin including Vitamins A, D, E and C, Silica from herbal sources, Norwegian Kelp, hydrolyzed bovine collagen, rice protein and zinc.  These nutrients synergistically support healthy, youthful skin.</P>
<P>  All the ingredients in FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS are as completely natural as possible.   The active ingredients are either in their totally natural occurring state or have been concentrated for maximum results.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> YOUTHFUL RADIANCE</H2>
<P>   Your skin is the largest organ of your body and is the first thing someone sees when they look at you. As the aging process continues, the most visual changes occur here.  Our outward appearance influences how we feel about ourselves and how others see us.   By taking FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS, you can ensure that your skin receives many important nutrients valuable in revitalizing and preserving that youthful glow.</P>
<P> Younger skin cells are more vibrant and look more youthful than older ones. When they are supplied with the proper nutrients, they are able to retain moisture and contain more collagen, which results in healthy, thicker skin that is more elastic.</P>
<P>  FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS help your skin regain and retain its youthful radiance from within. It provides essential nutrients that feed the lower skin levels where new skin cells develop.  The combination of these fantastic tablets with the FOREVER YOUNG topical skin care products is the best way to have that youthful skin you have always wanted.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS are formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS</H2> 
<P>It is recommended to take one tablet twice a day, usually first thing in the morning and at bedtime. This is the minimum amount to take, and at the same time usually produces great results.  However, if you have damaged skin, or would like to get maximum results as soon as possible, more tablets should be taken. If you intend to be in the sun, it is a good idea to take several tablets for additional protection.  For maximum results, use FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS with the four great FOREVER YOUNG topical skin care products, <A HREF="mfyem.htm">EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A>,<A HREF="mfyfp.htm"> FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A>, <A HREF="mfydn.htm">DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX </A> and <A HREF="mfybp.htm">BODY PERFECTING LOTION</A>. However, the tablets can be taken alone if desired.  Other Life  Plus  products that are especially synergistic with FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS are <A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS</A> and <A HREF="mprotx.htm">PROTX II</A>.</P>

<P>Suggested use: The usual amount taken is one tablet twice a day in the morning and at bedtime. More can be taken if desired for faster results.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SEBACEOUS GLANDS </H2>

<P>   Detergents and soaps solubilize lipids on the skin and remove them, thereby disrupting the protective barrier of the skin. They also deplete the opening of the sebaceous gland of oils. This acts as a stimulus to the sebaceous gland to secrete more oil. This sets up a vicious cycle which creates more oil requiring more detergent use, thus more oil is produced. This action functions through a feedback system within the gland that senses the surface tension of the oil in the sebaceous duct, which serves to regulate the amount of oil produced by the gland. The action of the FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER does not disrupt this healthy mechanism, but works in supporting it.  Consequently, the glands sense that adequate oil is in the duct and normalizes its production of oils.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FREE RADICALS</H2>
<P>   A little known fact about skin is the high potential that it has for generating free radicals.   This is inherent because of its protein nature.  Rubbing and grinding proteins has been shown by the scientific community to be an established method of generating lots of free radicals.  Using harsh abrasives on the skin not only breaks its surface, but also causes free radical formation, which further results in an inflammatory reaction in the skin. This inflammatory reaction will attract white blood cells to the area.  These cells carry highly irritating peroxides that are part of the defense mechanism used by the body to prevent infection in areas of damaged skin. So when the skin is artificially damaged by physical abrasion and chemicals in non-biologic cleansers, the body reacts in a way that can be easily monitored. FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER is designed to be totally compatible with skin physiology and not produce free radicals when applied.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WALL OF DEFENSE</H2>
<P>   Functioning as the first line, or outer wall of defense, the skin needs a healthy set of mature cells at its periphery or outer layer.  This is the true battle zone, designed to withstand abrasions, infections, heat, moisture and cold.  It takes time to mature these outermost cells -- anywhere from 18 to 28 days. When the skin is irritated, the cells must move out faster to replace those that are injured or sloughed off. This is the basis  of  the  many  so-called  "natural  acid" products -- they are primarily nothing more than skin irritants.  These cells are immature cells, not younger cells!  You cannot send a child to do an adult's work. Even soaps can create this type of damage in about ten percent of individuals who have sensitive skin.  They coagulate the keratin proteins and denature them, which causes the lower cells to step up production to replace them.  With repeated use of soaps, some individuals experience a chronic inflammation of the skin. Housewives, nurses, dishwashers and those exposed to chemical cleansers and soaps frequently have this condition.</P>
<P>  As FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER is spread over the skin, it removes peroxidized lipids and foreign matter, makeup and environmental contaminants. As it is removed with a soft, non-abrasive cloth or cotton, all this debris is carried away. A soft, well moisturized, texturized and protected skin is the result. The skin is protected with Vitamin E, Proanthocyanidins, Herbal Ingredients and other free radical scavengers, as well as deep penetrating skin, softeners that prepare the skin for the application of  <A HREF="mfyfp.htm">FOREVER FACIAL PERFECTING GEL </A> and <A HREF="mfydn.htm">DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX</A>. This is accomplished by adjusting the partition coefficient of the stratum corneum, providing retained moisture in the outer layer of the skin providing a silky pathway for the <A HREF="mfyfp.htm">FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A> and/or <A HREF="mfydn.htm">DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX</A> and allowing greater penetration of them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</H2>
 <P>Place a small quantity of EMOLLIENT CLEANSER in the palm of your hand.  Apply the cleanser using a circular motion covering all areas of the face with a very thin layer. The circular motion is effective in removing dirt and makeup, while stimulating the skin cells at the same time. Remove the cleanser with a warm, damp, clean wash cloth. Do not use dry tissues, as they obtain harsh fibers, which may be unkind to delicate facial skin. Go over the face gently until all traces of makeup and dirt are removed, then pat dry. Your skin is now prepared to apply the<A HREF="mfyfp.htm"> FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A>.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: Use once or twice a day to remove makeyp and the build-up of debris and environmental contaminants before applying <A HREF="mfyfp.htm">FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A>.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FACIAL SKIN </H2>

<P>  Facial skin is the most exposed area on the body. Sunlight, extremes of temperature, blasts of hot and cold air,  environmental  toxins  and  other  offenders  like cigarette smoke insult it every minute of every day. It is never covered.  Yet, this small area of less than nine percent of our total skin surface suffers more than the other ninety one percent.  Also, our skin is stressed by internal factors that arise from internal emotional and metabolic factors.  Think of the phrase "putting on a good face" and understand the meaning of that phrase in terms of emotional stress pumped into our skin. Stress produces adrenalin related products, which not only restrict blood flow to our skin, but also generates potent, destructive free radicals. All of these forces combine to wreck havoc with the texture, color and resiliency of our skin. To help correct these problems with a view toward efficacy and ease of use, and to meet the demands placed on  facial  skin,  FOREVER  YOUNG  FACIAL PERFECTING GEL was developed.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> STRENGTHENING AND FIRMING</H2>
<P> The ingredients in FACIAL  PERFECTING GEL include  antioxidants  such  as  Vitamin E  and Anthocyanidins, as well as moisturizers and FOREVER YOUNG marine concentrate. In addition, it includes theophylline conjugated with Algisium Complex. All of these ingredients act to prevent free radical damage, either by quenching the free radicals, stopping a chain reaction of lipid peroxidation, or binding iron so that it does not react with the reactive oxygen species to form hydroxyl radicals. The overall action of the ingredients is to strengthen and firm the connective tissues in the dermis, particularly elastin and collagen. Along with the fat  deposits  beneath  the  skin,  these  proteins  are responsible for the shape and tone of the facial skin. Daily use of the product will result in firmer skin that resists wrinkling and sagging.   Sagging is mainly a gravitational effect, while wrinkling is an inflammatory response induced by free radicals. Both of these result from both exogenous (external as in sun exposure or cigarette smoke), or endogenous (internal as in toxic drug intake or alcohol abuse).
  Careful balancing of repair and protection functions in FOREVER YOUNG FACIAL PERFECTING GEL allow the use of several active ingredients that sense the need for repair at particular areas of the face.  The enzymes that replace worn or damaged collagen and elastin are assisted by these ingredients, which then effect the repair.   Critical to this process is the compatibility of the ingredients, not only to work in a synergistic manner with the normal skin physiological processes that maintain the skin in good repair, but also to aid and stimulate these processes as needed by the skin. The end results are the firming of the tissues and laying down of fresh, vibrant tissue that is responsible for the skin's strength and more youthful beauty.</P>


<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANTIOXIDANTS</H2>
<P>  The  antioxidants  contained   in  FACIAL PERFECTING GEL not only slow down the peroxidation of the lipids, which destroys cells, but actually  protects  many  vital  cellular  functions, particularly the DNA in the cell. The long term benefit from   using   FOREVER YOUNG FACIAL PERFECTING GEL is that there is less tissue damage, fewer abnormal cells and a better protected skin. The net result is that chronic inflammation of the skin, which is associated with aging, is markedly reduced, so that continuing skin damage is averted and skin repair is now possible on a continuing basis. Supplying the skin with antioxidants makes good sense, since the body does not give the skin the best it has to offer. The skin, especially the facial skin, needs antioxidants every bit as much as any part of the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE FACIAL PERFECTING GEL </H2>
<P>After cleansing the face with the <A HREF="mfyem.htm">EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A>, apply a small amount of FACIAL PERFECTING GEL to the five designated areas of the face. Smooth gently under the eyes, on the forehead and around the cheeks and lips. Do not apply to the lips. Then put a small amount under your chin and spread over the entire front of your neck area down to the collar bone. This will help to tighten and smooth your neck area. Allow the gel to dry completely for 1 to 2 minutes. Your skin  is  now  prepared  to  use  the  <A HREF="mfydn.htm">DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX</A>. Men also get the most benefit when they cleanse with <A HREF="mfyem.htm">EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A>, but if they prefer to just use the PERFECTING GEL, they can. The best time for them to apply it is immediately after shaving.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: Apply twice a day to all areas of the face. Maximum restructuring results are seen if applied after <A HREF="mfyem.htm">FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A>.</P>

<BR><BR> 



 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> REPAIRING THE SKIN </H2>

<P>The ingredients in the FOREVER YOUNG DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX take advantage of the circadian rhythm characteristics of the body. Nighttime is reserved for repair of body tissues and the rebuilding of damaged systems, plus conserving and replenishing energy stores.  Cell division and growth occur at a much greater rate at night than during the day. This serves two purposes. The energy required for cell division need not be diverted for other causes, and the exposure to ultraviolet rays is less at night than during the day, which protects the vulnerable mitotic cell from radiation injury.</P>
<P>  The skin needs more nutrients to supply the raw materials for repair. These nutrients include amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and fuel to make it all happen. During the skin's repair process, the increased metabolic rate in some cells generates more free radicals through oxidative phosphorylation.  Antioxidants are needed to keep cellular damage in check; therefore, adequate antioxidants must be available both internally and topically as well. Vitamin C and Vitamin E are not well supplied to the skin by the body, so supplements are very worthwhile for the skin. As a matter of fact, the overall  nutritional  status of an  individual can be evaluated by looking at the skin.   The use of Proanthocyanidins   and   glutathione   provide   a cytoplasmic and extracellular source of super potent antioxidants that work with and support activity of other antioxidants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VITAMIN A</H2>
<P>  High levels of Vitamin A in FOREVER YOUNG DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX provide retinol, which is ultimately converted to retinoic acid. It, then, acts as an inducer and controller of cell proliferation and creates a delicate balance of maintenance and new growth for repair of the skin. The beta glucans contained in   FOREVER  YOUNG   Marine  Concentrate  act primarily as a Langerhans cell stimulator which initiates a cascade of events that activates helper T-cells. This, in turn, activates macrophages that send out specific interleukens to turn on fibroblasts, enthothelial cells and kerationcytes.  This action results in a comprehensive physiological repair process that is an essential part of the biological surveillance and maintenance system of the body. New blood vessels and new connective tissues are laid down along with a renewal of epidermal cells. This stimulation of the Langerhans cells is a daily process, for they are the sentinel cells of the skin. In sun damaged skin they are markedly reduced so that the effectiveness of beta glucan is also reduced. This is a major reason that it is best to avoid extensive exposure to the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ELASTIN FORMATION </H2>
<P>The FOREVER YOUNG Marine Concentrate contained in the DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX stimulates the formation of elastin by an unknown mechanism. It stimulates epidermal growth and repair and balances skin tones for a smooth, even complexion.   These physiological responses are most likely immune in nature, and function through second messenger relays. Most of the reactions we see with the FOREVER YOUNG Marine Concentrate are immune reactions representing a complex series of steps that are largely unknown at this time, but are mainly mediated through helper T-cells and macrophages.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE THE DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX</H2>
<P>  After using <A HREF="mfyem.htm"> FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A> and applying  <A HREF="mfyfp.htm">FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A>, you are ready to apply the DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX.  It is a very highly concentrated cream and can produce fantastic results if used on a consistent basis. Apply lightly and easily over the entire face.  Do not get it in the eyes.  The day application is important to provide protection from the free radical action from exposure to the environment. The nighttime application enhances the body's ability to repair the facial skin while this process is most active. Gently massage FOREVER YOUNG DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX to the neck area as far back as the ears.   It will penetrate into the skin leaving no unpleasant residue. You will love its soft, pleasant feel and appreciate its non-greasy clean, smooth feeling.</P>

<H1>FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION: Reduces Cellulite</H1>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR><BR><BR>
<H3>BODY PERFECTION LOTION Contains:</H3>
<P>Theophylline Complex: Active ingredient encourages the body to burn fat</P>
<P>Diazolidnyl (Urea/Methylparaben/Propylparaben): Preservative</P>
<P>Oat Oil: Powerul antioxidant and emollient; provides deep antioxidant activity</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TYPES OF SKIN </H2>

<P>   The areas of the thighs, legs, arms, abdomen, buttocks and along the trunk are a different type of skin than the face. These areas have certain regional characteristics that must be respected when formulating a total skin care system. Body skin tends to be thicker and contain more fatty material than the facial skin. This body skin can tolerate a more vigorous cleansing and will actually shine when cleansed well.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW FAT IS BURNED</H2>
<P>  The natural xanthine compounds contained in the FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION are theophylline conjugates.  These facilitate penetration of theophylline into and through the skin, all the way down to the fat tissues, which are special cells known as lipocytes or adipcytes that contain the fat.  In order for fat to be burned, it must be broken down by the enzyme lipase. In order for this to happen, lipase must be activated. The activation of lipase takes place after the completion of a series of other enzyme reactions involving protein kinases. This series of reactions is called a "kinase cascade." That is, one kinase activates another, which activates another, etc. until lipase is finally activated.   Another substance, Cyclic AMP starts this cascade. The level of Cyclic AMP has to be controlled so the body's fat stores are not completely used up.  Another enzyme called PDE inactivates Cyclic AMP. This happens rapidly as PDE destroys Cyclic AMP almost as fast as it is formed. Theophylline inhibits PDE so the action of Cyclic AMP can be prolonged. In this way, breaking down of fat by lipase can continue longer. This results in the burning of fat, a restructuring of the body and loss of weight.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MOST BENEFIT</H2>
<P> It  is  important  that  when  you  use  FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION for cellulite loss, weight loss and re-shaping, that you understand what is happening so you can receive the most benefit. It facilitates the body's natural process of breaking down fat so that it can be used up and eliminated.  You will receive maximum benefit if you exercise after you apply it to the areas you want to reduce. When you apply it, calories are liberated from fat breaking down. If you exercise when this is happening, the specific calories from fat will be burned. The result is specific weight loss from fat, which is ideal. Lean body mass percentage will increase and it will be easier to maintain the loss. It is not necessary to be over zealous with your exercise. Usually reasonable amounts of regular exercise like walking or cycling is adequate. For example, apply BODY PERFECTING LOTION to thighs and abdomen and take a brisk walk. You will be surprised at the positive results.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FOOD INTAKE</H2>
<P> Food intake can play an important role. When we eat, insulin levels increase. Insulin blocks the action of lipase, which slows down body fat breakdown. This lessens the effect of theophylline. Therefore, if you desire maximum effects for cellulite or weight loss, delay eating for a while after applying BODY PERFECTING LOTION.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MULTI-FUNCTIONAL</H2>
<P> FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION is not just for reducing fat and cellulite.  It is a wonderful, general body lotion that makes the skin feel soft and supple and look great, too. The special concentrated oat protein contains antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents and iron chelating agents. It provides a soft matte finish to the skin, which tends to reduce the appearance of aging lines. At the same time, this finish tends to scatter sunlight, which reduces its energy and thus provides more protection from ultraviolet damage.  The application of the FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION results in multiple benefits, as it is multi-functional. Its hydration of the skin permits a softer feel, and at the same time does not interfere with healthy skin physiology. It provides a good moisturizing function to combat dry skin. Not only does dry skin not feel good, but it also sends signals to lower tissues to produce more cells.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUGGESTIONS</H2>
<P>  The contouring action of the BODY PERFECTING LOTION is aimed at reducing those areas of fatty tissue, which protrude into the skin's surface. The system is based on the enzymes described above and works best when combined with mild exercise and a slight reduction in diet. It is important, however, to understand that its many special synergistic ingredients have been designed to meet the needs of skin, regardless of the activity level one has. A mild exercise program, coupled with the use of the BODY PERFECTING LOTION, will provide maximum benefit to the skin. It increases the skin's blood supply, which in turn allows more of the active ingredients to reach deeper levels of the skin. When you can, vigorously cleanse your body with the FOREVER YOUNG BODY SPONGE, then apply BODY PERFECTING LOTION where desired action is wanted, especially where cellulite is present.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: To reduce fat deposits or cellulite, gently apply to the abdomen, thighs, butocks or other areas being re-shaped. It is best to then walk or exercise to burn the fat calories that are liberated. Also, use as a high quality, body lotion everywhere.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING </H2>

<P>Aging is a continuous process of gradual loss of functionality associated with chronic inflammation. The body has an enormous capacity to repair damage if given a  little  help  from  our  diets,  supplements,  reasonable exercise and good skin care.  Some of the oxygen we breathe is converted to dangerous free radicals. Our skin is exposed to numerous toxins every minute of every day. Free radicals damage our DNA, which results in aging and disease. This does not have to happen, especially at the rate it is happening today. It can be controlled.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING SKIN</H2>
<P> The skin ages due to DNA damage, which is induced by both chemical and physical means. The first signs we see in any individual in regards to aging is their skin.  The first signs we see are structural changes like wrinkles and sagging then color and texture changes. Red spots and dilated veins appear. Brown spots appear on hands and face and the skin becomes thinner and less elastic. Structural changes result when collagen and elastin quantity and quality are reduced. Your skin is an open book to your state of health. Of all things the skin tells us the most about a person.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SKIN PHYSIOLOGY </H2>
<P>Your skin is not just a covering for the body, it is your largest organ. It is a dynamic, ever growing organ that is vital to your existence. It must remain healthy to keep the good things in and the bad things out. It serves to control your body heat and acts as a kind of garbage disposal for the body.  That is. it is a major organ of detoxification. Our skin controls the rate of water loss from our body and prevents water from the outside from entering our body as well.  The FOREVER YOUNG TOTAL SKIN CARE SYSTEM can be a major factor in your efforts to maintain healthy skin and to feel better about your appearance for years to come.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE SCIENCE </H2>
<P>The science behind the FOREVER YOUNG TOTAL SKIN CARE SYSTEM is based on a thorough knowledge of skin physiology and the real biological needs of the body to maintain itself in good repair. Since skin is damaged both from the inside and outside the body,  a  system  that  recognizes  the  need  for comprehensive treatment, to correct the combined problems simultaneously, is the only one that can be truly effective.   The  FOREVER YOUNG TOTAL  SKIN CARE SYSTEM meets these requirements by supplying you with the most sophisticated skin care system modern science has ever achieved.  The FOREVER YOUNG TOTAL  SKIN CARE SYSTEM topically corrects underlying skin damaged by assisting the body's repair mechanism to restore the skin to a youthful appearance; then, internally helps in  preventing further damage by blocking and neutralizing free radical activity with powerful antioxidants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT TO EXPECT</H2> 
<P>There are two things that determine the result you obtain. The first is based on your commitment. The second is based on the degree of damage you now have. The more severe the damage, the longer it will take. Many years of sunbathing or heavy smoking produce leathery skin that takes longer to repair, but positive results can be achieved if you  continue  the  program.   While  most  users  see results in as little as a month, others will require three to four months. Using it twice a day will produce better results than using it once daily.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: For the face, cleanse morning and at bedtime with EMOLLIENT CLEANSER, then apply FACIAL PERFECTING GEL followed with DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX.</P>
<P>For the body, cleanse skin with the BODY SPONGE when showering or bathing. Also apply BODY PERFECTION LOTION to soften and moisturize the skin. Apply to specific areas to reduce cellulite.</P>

<H1>ECOLOGY PAK: Nutritionally Establishes Bowel Ecology </H1>
<BR>
<HR>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> YEAST</H2>
<P>Candida Albicans is the technical name for a yeast that is a normal inhabitant of the human body. It is passed to us from contact with others either at or shortly after birth, and remains with us throughout our lives. It quickly finds its way onto our skin and into our intestinal tracts where it takes up residence with other microorganisms.  Under normal conditions, Candida Albicans live and perform normal vital tasks in harmony with all of their neighbors within our body.</P>
<P>  Over the past forty years the occurrence of elevated levels of yeast have increased dramatically in many people to the point that it has become a problem for hundreds of thousands of individuals. Part of the reason is the more extensive use of  some of the modern immune system depressing drugs such as the steroids like hydrocortisone and antibiotics. They help create an environment that is ideal for overgrowth of Candida yeast. When the Candida balance is shifted slightly, the result can be a vaginal discharge, anal itching, or an oral yeast infection usually called thrush, which deposits an aggravating white coating on the tongue. In the severely debilitated person, the yeast can grow very rapidly, creating a number  of problems ranging from headaches, joint pain, night sweats, fatigue and allergies to severe mental and physical disorders. Quite often people have a general overall feeling of malaise.   They don't feel good and have difficulty concentrating.  Many people with this problem seem to walk around in a daze.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAM</H2>
<P>  A comprehensive nutritional support program is important in interrupting the self perpetuating cycle of yeast overgrowth.  The use of a carefully selected nutritional program along with dietary measures can help restore the normal balance necessary to keep these microorganisms in check. The basics of such a diet are to severely limit the simple carbohydrates (sugars) in your diet,  avoid  fungus  or yeast containing foods  like mushrooms, wines, etc., concentrate on foods that are known to be good for the immune system and supplement with specific products that fight the yeast naturally and help restore healthy ecology of the digestive tract.</P>
<P>  ECOLOGY PAK is the only program of its kind that supplies the many special amino acids such as L-Cysteine and L-Tyrosine, along with others known for their natural detoxifying and immune supportive effects. They also help maintain consistent blood sugar levels that is so important in yeast management.  Also included in ECOLOGY NO. 1 are the synergistic herbs, Pau d' Arco, Clove and Horse-radish. These special herbs are known for their nutritional effect of naturally supporting the healthy ecology of the intestinal tract. Restoring normal colon ecology plays a key role in maintaining a healthy immune system. The normal healthy colon contains a considerable amount  of fatty  acids  as  byproducts  of the bacterial breakdown of dietary fiber and other organicmaterial. These fatty acids play a key role in maintaining the proper balance between yeast, healthy bacteria and other microorganisms that inhabit our digestive tracts naturally.</P>
<P>  ECOLOGY NO. 1 supplies many of the nutrients necessary for support of the immune system while at the same  time  helping  the  body  deal  with  the toxicity created by an imbalance of yeast organisms. Along with generous amounts of Vitamin A in the form of Beta-Carotene and Vitamin C as Calcium Ascorbate, ECOLOGY NO. 1 supplies concentrated tissue nutrients from Thymus, Lymph and Spleen, all of which provide nutritional support for the immune system. Also included is Zinc, which is also well known as a natural immune stimulant.</P>
<P>  ECOLOGY NO. 2 provides a generous amount of these short-chain fatty acids as Caprylic Acid and Undecylenic Acid. These fatty acids are carefully manufactured in a special tablet form to ensure a constant slow release along the intestinal tract.  They work in combination to help restore and preserve the body's normal ecological balance between yeast and bacteria.</P>
<P>  ECOLOGY NO. 3 is a concentrated form of a synergistic combination of different bio-cultures from Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Lactobacillus Bulgaricus, Lactobacillus  Bifidus  and  Lactobacillus  Salivarius. Normally these microorganisms help maintain proper pH in the colon and provide a number of other health supporting benefits.   They are normally present in low levels when yeast overgrowth is present. Supplementing with ECOLOGY NO. 3 is the ideal way to help re-establish them in the colon.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  Both ECOLOGY NO. 1 and ECOLOGY NO. 2 are formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added  benefit  of receiving  the  numerous  health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE ECOLOGY PAK </H2>
<P>Take two ECOLOGY NO. 1 tablets three times a day with meals.  Take one ECOLOGY NO. 2 tablet plus one-half teaspoonful of ECOLOGY NO. 3 and one heaping teaspoonful of  COLODYNE twice a day between meals. Take one heaping teaspoonful of  COLODYNE twice a day between meals. For best results it is important to avoid refined carbohydrate-s (sugars) in the diet as well as known fungus and yeast containing foods such as mushrooms, wines and yeast breads. Eat foods known to be of value for the immune system. Eat lots of vegetables and plenty of fiber. </P>
<BR><BR><BR>
<P>  ECOLOGY NO. 1 tablets are a broad spectrum supplement that provide many nutrients that support 
the immune system, while helping the body deal with toxicity of yeast imbalance.  It contains Pau d'Arco 
herb because of its natural ability to fight yeast.  </P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> INNER ACT</H2>

<P>Herbs  have  been used  since  creation  to provide for our health and well being, for entire civilizations for that matter. The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage.  Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies.  This is usually referred to in the literature today  as phytotherapy.  We probably never will understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits now.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal-based-products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific   nutritional   goals.  These synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants, and, at times, concentrated tissue nutrients.  By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal-based-products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE COMBINATION</H2>
<P>  INNER ACT is a unique combination of herbs and herbal extracts, which can be a very important product if you need it. The lack of fiber in the diets of most individuals today often results in the muscles of their colons not receiving adequate "stretching" because of a lack of bulk.   As a result, they do not get enough stimulation for contraction which can result in too slow movement of food through the lower digestive tract. This is usually referred to as a sluggish colon.</P>
<P>  INNER ACT contains ten herbal ingredients. They include Rhubarb Root, Licorice Root, Fennel Seed and Anise Seed. The Irish Moss in INNER ACT contains a high proportion of a natural gum that lubricates and soothes the colon and absorbs toxins. A small amount of dehydrated Prune Concentrate is also included.</P>
<P>  Prune Concentrate contains a high percentage of natural compounds that are known to be good detoxifiers and cleansers and it also helps to stimulate peristalsis (movement of the muscles in the colon helping the process of elimination). Parsley is a natural cleanser and works well with the other herbs in this preferred preparation.</P>
<P>  The predominant herbal ingredients in INNER ACT are Cascara Sagrada Bark and Senna Leaf Powder. These two herbs have been used for many decades as natural herbal laxatives.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
 <P> INNER ACT is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE INNER ACT</H2>
<P>  A high percentage of older people love INNER ACT because they often have sluggish colons.   They comment that they have more energy and feel better when they take steps to ensure that their lower digestive tracts (colons) stay cleaned out.  Many of them do not have  regular elimination.    But  many  younger people have the same problem, including teenagers.</P>
<P>  It is strongly recommended that almost everyone use <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> every day and then take INNER ACT when needed. In general, it is a good idea to take INNER ACT for one or two days each month. Some people may need it weekly. You will have to be your own judge and tailor its use to your needs.</P>
<P>   Usually two to four tablets are taken at one time. It is recommended to take them at bedtime.  Usually an elimination will occur the next morning. It is not recommended to take them in the morning or afternoon as elimination may occur during the day.</P>
<P>  In the past it has been thought that consistent use of INNER ACT could result in dependence. This, of course, is of consideration when it, or any other laxative, is used on a daily basis, over a long period of time.  We have not seen this to be a problem and recommend that you concentrate on eating a natural diet as much as possible, take <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> daily, walk a reasonable amount each day and take Life Plus INNER ACT as needed.</P>

Suggested Use:  Two to four tablets at bedtime as needed to produce a gentle elimination the next 
morning. Some individuals may need more. </P>

</TABLE>




 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ABSORPTION </H2>

<P>   SUSTENASE is designed to help us digest our foods naturally and properly so we can absorb the nutrients we eat.   It helps to maintain a healthy digestive tract by reducing the amount of undigested foodstuffs remaining and to maintain healthy pHs throughout the digestive tract.    It also  supplies  a representative  amount of beneficial micro-flora also supporting bowel ecology. It has been said that "we are what we eat." That is only partially true.  We are made of what we eat, digest, absorb and assimilate into our bodies.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DIGESTION OF FOODS</H2>
 <P>  Digestion starts in the mouth with chewing the foods we eat. In the saliva is an enzyme, Ptylin, that begins to break down starches into more simple sugars.</P>
<P>   When food is swallowed, the stomach takes over by secreting Hydrochloric Acid and the enzyme, Pepsin. Hydrochloric Acid further digests the starches and begins protein digestion.</P>
<P>   In about 30 minutes the food leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine, where it is exposed to more digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreas.   They consist of (l) Proteases to digest proteins, (2) Amylases to digest starches, and (3) Lipases to digest fats.   In addition to these, the gall bladder secretes bile for the emulsification and digestion of fats.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> INDIGESTION</H2>
 <P>   If the body is healthy and working properly, it should produce all of these enzymes in sufficient quantities to ensure proper digestion. However, many people do not produce enough of these enzymes. As a result, they often get the common symptoms of indigestion, such as gas, bloating, heartburn and constipation.  Unfortunately, thousands of people take antacids because they have seen the ads on TV that convince them they have too much stomach acid when, in most cases, the reverse is actually true.</P>
 <P>  Antacids actually slow down or even stop the digestive process and give only temporary relief. Antacids only postpone the long term problems that arise from improper digestion.  It is much more rational to supplement the body with natural enzymes to ensure that the digestive tract can digest the food properly.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TWO PHASES</H2>
<P>   SUSTENASE is a two-phase digestive supplement formulated in a unique manner so that it releases certain enzymes and buffering agents in the stomach and others in the small intestine.</P>
<P>   To provide supplemental acid in the stomach, SUSTENASE releases Betaine HCl and Glutamic Acid HCl.  In addition, SUSTENASE releases the active protein digesting enzymes Pepsin, Papayotin and Bromelain in the first phase in the stomach, where protein digestion begins.</P>
 <P>  When food leaves the acidic stomach, it enters the more alkaline intestinal environment. Each phase of the SUSTENASE tablet is buffered to conform to each environment to provide maximum activity of the enzymes in each location.  In its second phase, SUSTENASE releases Pancreatin, a concentrated mixture of enzymes that digest proteins, fats and complex carbohydrates (starches).  It also releases Pancrelipase, a highly active form of concentrated pancreas enzymes that is especially good for fat digestion plus Ox Bile concentrate for the emulsification and digestion of fats.</P>
<P>   Because indigestion is such a widespread problem, SUSTENASE is one of the most popular Life Plus products, one that should be taken by just about everyone. Without proper digestion, the food we eat is of no value to us, no matter how many nutrients are in it. Improper digestion may also cause food allergies as well as other types of allergies.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>   SUSTENASE is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
   When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE IT</H2>
<P>   Take one or more SUSTENASE tablets with each meal. It is best to take them as you begin the meal so the digestive enzymes and buffering agents can be mixed well with the food being eaten. With large meals and those high in fats and heavy proteins such as large steak dinners, etc. more tablets can be taken if desired. If you should forget and not take your SUSTENASE at the beginning of the meal, take it later in the meal or even after the meal is eaten. You will still obtain benefits from it.</P>
 
<P> 
Suggested Use:  One to two tablets at the beginning of each meal. But can be taken during or just after 
meals. Do not refrigerate. </P>

</CENTER>


 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BACTERIA </H2>

<P>   Bacteria are everywhere. We swallow them with our food, drink them with water, they are in the air we breathe, on our skin, in our mouths, digestive tract, sinuses and other areas of our bodies.  In so far as health is concerned, some of them are harmful, some neutral and some are very beneficial. Some are extremely valuable for good health as they work harmoniously with our immune system.  In a healthy colon, there are literally billions of beneficial or "friendly" bacteria. Under favorable conditions, they multiply at a fast enough rate to keep pace with the large numbers that are lost during elimination.  Bacteria is also referred to as micro-organisms. When they are located in the intestinal tract, they are referred to as "intestinal flora," micro-flora or sometimes just "flora".</P>
<P>   These friendly bacteria synthesize many important vitamins in the digestive tract including vitamin K and some of the B vitamins. A very important function they perform is helping the colon maintain a proper pH or acid-base balance. It is necessary for the pH to stay in the correct range in order for other health supporting bacteria to exist. It is also important to keep levels of antagonistic micro-organisms under control.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> LOW LEVELS</H2>
<P>   At times, the taking of antibiotics can be necessary, even life saving. When we take them to kill off the infectious bacteria, we also destroy large amounts of the beneficial flora in our digestive tracts.  When the level becomes disturbed, or when the bowel ecology becomes out of balance, health problems can develop. In this instance, it is important to replenish the friendly bacteria as soon as possible in order to maintain good health. They can be replaced by concentrating on eating foods they are contained in and supplementing with SALIVAREX.</P>
<P>   Dairy products are a good source of friendly lactobacillus, especially yogurt and kefir. However, the milk that most people drink today is pasteurized, or heated to about 165 degrees F. So, for the most part, we have lost this source of lactobacillus in our diets and are not receiving the quantities of these bacteria in our diets as we used to. It is a good idea to routinely eat some live culture containing foods such as yogurt, kefir, etc. Be sure the products are guaranteed to contain live cultures. It is actually best to make your own yogurt to be assured of bacteria content.</P>
<P>   Bad breath is usually a good indication that normal bacteria levels are low.  When lactobacillus levels are low in the colon, partially digested food decays, produce foul gas and toxemia. The prevalence of cold sores (herpes simplex), constipation, diarrhea, acne, vaginitis, headache, symptoms of hypoglycemia, yeast infections and others are often signs of low flora levels.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DAIRY & LACTOSE</H2>
<P>   Many people seem to be allergic to dairy products. The primary reason is quite often not that they are truly allergic to them but that they cannot deal with the lactose (commonly called milk sugar) contained in the dairy products. They cannot digest lactose, or milk sugar, and this can lead to allergies, headaches, cramps, mucous formation and many other health problems. The various kinds of Lactobacillus bacteria can digest it. This is why many people can eat yogurt, cultured milks and kefir even though they cannot handle dairy products like milk, cheese, ice cream, etc.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VIRUS AND YEAST</H2>
<P>   Cold sores, caused by the herpes simplex virus, are a reliable indicator that micro-flora is becoming lower than acceptable. Constipation and diarrhea can develop from decreased levels of friendly bacteria.
   It is believed that yeast infections, including thrush, vaginitis, and vaginal infections with abnormal amounts of discharge, are associated with decreased micro-flora levels.   Anyone with chronic infections should consider supplementing with lactobacillus as they support the immune system and help restore healthy ecology. People with toxemia and those going through any kind of detoxification program should supplement with SALIVAREX.</P>


<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE FORMULA</H2>
<P>  SALIVAREX contains the four most lactobacillus  for supplemental use.  The Acidophilus  and Bulgaricus strains quite often occur together in nature. Bifidus is an  extremely  beneficial  strain  and  usually  not contained in this type of supplement as it is expensive and difficult to produce. Bifidus is normally present in the digestive tracts of newborn babies.  While the babies are breast feeding it usually maintains its levels and can multiply. As they grow older and are exposed to whole milk and other foods, Lactobacillus Bifidus disappears.</P>
<P>   One special feature of  SALIVAREX is that it contains a large quantity of Lactobacillus Salivarius, a unique strain of highly specialized super micro-flora. This highly active organism neutralizes many pathogens which thrive in an unhealthy colon. It  has  the  ability  to  dramatically  increase  energy  levels  by breaking down undigested proteins making them available for use.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  SALIVAREX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus Phytozyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE SALIVAREX</H2>
</P>   SALIVAREX capsules should be kept in the refrigerator. It is a good idea to take a bottle of SALIVAREX every three or four months for routine replenishing.   When low levels of lactobacillus are obvious, four capsules can be taken three to six times a day until one bottle is used to build up levels quickly. Then, one or two capsules twice a day. Many people supplement once or twice a day as an ongoing way to keep their levels of friendly bacteria up to par.  SALIVAREX capsules can also be opened and placed into baby formula or sprinkled on food.</P>
<P>   SALIVAREX is nutritionally helpful to maintain a healthy colon.  The Life Plus Products <A HREF="mecol.htm">ECOLOGY NO. 3</A>  and <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> are compatible with SALIVAREX. ECOLOGY NO. 3 is a highly concentrated powder that contains large quantities of all four lactobacillus strains, but  SALIVAREX is more concentrated with L-Salivarius.</P>

Suggested Use: One or more capsules two or three times per day. Refrigerate

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> STRESS </H2>

<P>   In today's fast paced, stressful times it is no wonder that tranquilizers are the largest selling category of prescription drugs sold in America.
  The lack of physical exercise, especially when combined with the lack of a nutritious diet is thought by most experts to be the biggest contributor to nervousness, anxiety and depression.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> EXERCISE</H2>
<P>   Exercise is our first line of defense against tension, anxiety and depression. Exercising increases circulation to all of the organs of the body.  Supplying them with more oxygen and nutrition helps the muscles relax. In addition, it lowers the build-up of metabolic end products and we feel better.  However, it is difficult for most people to stick with exercise programs.  It takes real dedication but does pay off over the long term.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DIET</H2>
<P>   Diet is one of the real culprits responsible for anxiety. Most people eat too much, and in addition, their diets do not contain the sufficient nutrients.  Our modern "convenience diets" are high in calories and low in vitamins and minerals. The B vitamins and the minerals, calcium and magnesium, are very important for the immune system, yet the diets of many people are deficient in these nutrients.</P>
<P>  The high consumption of sugar is probably the leading dietary contributor to nervousness and anxiety. Over a period of time this can lead to a condition known as hypoglycemia, which is very prevalent today. Hypoglycemia is a condition where our blood sugar levels get dangerously low at times.   This, too, contributes to nervousness, tension, restlessness and even depression.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> STIMULANTS</H2>
<P>  Quite often, people plagued with hypoglycemia, which is commonly expressed in tiredness and nervousness, resort to caffeine, nicotine, drugs, and sugar when they get the blues. However, these things merely aggravate the situation further, and so many get into a vicious cycle, usually without even knowing it.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> A NATURAL ALTERNATIVE</H2>
<P>   It is wise to eat a quality diet with adequate amounts of all the food groups. Make certain that your diet contains a good cross section of all the vitamins and minerals, especially the B vitamins, calcium and magnesium. You may consider supplementing with a well rounded foundational multiple product like <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A> and <A HREF="mcalmag.htm">CAL MAG PLUS</A>. In addition, the Life Plus natural herbal blend TRANQUILON may fit your program as well. Thousands of people like it because it does not produce the side effects of drowsiness, tiredness, etc.</P>
<P>  The TRANQUILON formula contains ten natural herbs that work together for their synergistic effect including Valerian Root, Passionflower, Hops, Black Cohosh, Wood Betony, Chamomile, Lady's Slipper, Cayenne, Chlorophyll and Skullcap.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  TRANQUILON is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE TRANQUILON</H2>
<P>  Most people take one or two tablets, two to three times throughout the day, which is usually adequate. However, three tablets can be taken each time if desired. Some individuals take it at bedtime by itself, or with <A HREF="mmel.htm">SOMNISET</A>. Other Life Plus products synergistic with <A HREF="mtranq.htm">TRANQUILON</A> are <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A>, <A HREF="mcandy.htm">CANDY CAL</A>, <A HREF="mmag.htm"> MAGNESIUM PLUS</A>, <A HREF="mcalmag.htm">CALMAG PLUS</A>. <A HREF="msupt.htm">SUPPORT TABS</A> and <A HREF="mmagicf.htm">INNER MAGIC F</A> for women and <A HREF="mmagicm.htm">INNER MAGIC M </A>for men.</P>



 <P>
Suggested Use:  Take from one to three tablets two or three times a day as desired.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE BRAIN </H2>


<P>  Mankind has long been fascinated by that gray, wrinkled matter contained within our skulls. Just as the heart, liver or stomach has been thought of as the seat of the emotions in various cultures, so also the brain has been regarded as the seat of intelligence.</P>
<P>  What we eat can affect our moods, mental alertness and memory causing much interest and research in brain function related to special nutrients in recent years.</P>
<P>  The brain is a complicated, well organized matrix of intricate nerve endings connecting each brain cell with many others. Billions of electrical nerve impulses travel back and forth within the brain every second. Many chemicals act as neurotransmitters that transport these impulses from one cell to another. If the brain has an inadequate  supply  of the  nutrients  it  needs  to manufacture these substances, it will be hindered in its ability to function properly.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ALZHEIMER'S</H2>
<P>  Malfunctions of the brain seem to be an increasing problem in western societies today with Alzheimer's Disease being one of the most common and most serious. It is the fourth leading cause of death among adults with about 100,000 deaths annually.  It afflicts between 2.5 and 4 million Americans and it is predicted to rise to 14 million victims in the year 2040. At age 65, your chance of getting Alzheimer's is 6%, at 75 it is 20% and is an incredible 47% at age 85. The disease begins with early confusion and progresses to the point of major forgetfulness, incontinence, difficult sleeping and major personality changes. Then, just about all motor activity is lost to the point of not being able to even eat without help.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SPECIAL FORMULA</H2>
<P>  This unique herbal based product contains the special Hyperizia Serrata, Gota Kola and Ginkgo Biloba concentrate plus Ginseng herbs. In addition, it contains the very special valuable amino acids L-Glutamine, L-Taurine,  L-Tyrosine  plus  N-Acetyl  Carnitine. Go-Enzyme Q-10 is included because of its fantastic anti-oxidant effect. FOOD FOR THOUGHT provides the nutrients specifically synergistic for support of healthy brain function.  Many individuals find FOOD FOR THOUGHT helpful for alertness and stamina.</P>
<P>  The amino acids in FOOD FOR THOUGHT serve as precursors, which the brain needs to produce important neurotransmitter serotonin. If inadequate amounts of these types of amino acids are not in the diet, too little serotonin is produced causing you to become nervous or have trouble sleeping.</P>
<P>  L-Glutamine is an amino acid that penetrates the barrier separating the brain from the rest of the body's circulatory system. Once inside the brain, L-Glutamine has the unusual ability to provide fuel for brain cells. Consequently, it is an energy source for the brain and has been used to improve learning and I.Q. Some alcoholics have been helped dramatically by L-Glutamine supplements.  Even though the body manufactures its own Glutamine, some people seem to need more than they can produce by themselves and supplementation is needed.</P>
<P>  Tyrosine is a precursor to Norepinephrine and Dopamine (two important neurotransmitters) in the brain that are excitatory and seem to keep you alert, sexually interested and ambitious.   Dopamine is deficient in people with Parkinson's disease.  Results are now becoming apparent about the nutritional value of Tyrosine in the prevention of depression.</P>
<P>  FOOD FOR THOUGHT contains the special nutrients for those who desire to keep an alert mind and a sharp memory. Some of them have been well known in other cultures for centuries and some are just now becoming understood. This formula is great for students, absent-minded professors and the elderly. Many believe the herbs and other nutrients help to prevent feelings of being depressed and nutritionally supports those who want to stay alert without resorting to caffeine or other harmful stimulants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  FOOD FOR THOUGHT is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE FOOD FOR THOUGHT</H2>

</TABLE>
<P> 



 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VITAMIN B-12</H2>

 <P> Experts agree that the essential nutrient Vitamin B-12 often increases energy and improves memory, appetite (when needed) and digestion. It is an absolute must for the maintenance of a healthy nervous system and is considered by many to play an important role as an anti-aging nutrient.</P>
<P>  Many of the functions of Vitamin B-12, such as building  blood  cells,  promoting  DNA  synthesis, naturally   interfering   with   inflammation   and strengthening the immune system are fundamental to a healthy body.</P>
<P>  Thousands of doctors have given Vitamin B-12 injections over the last several decades to help patients cope with stress, depression and exhaustion to name only a few.  It is true that some of its uses may not be "proven", but it is unlikely that its use would have been continued over the years if both doctors and their patients did not receive benefit from it. Vitamin B-12 has been used to help increase fertility in livestock for many years. A study actually demonstrated that Vitamin B-12 injections increased the sperm count in 27% of men participating that began the study with low levels.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUBLINGUAL</H2>
<P>  It is well known that the body has a difficult time absorbing Vitamin B-12 through the digestive tract. This is the  primary  reason that Vitamin  B-12  injections became  so  popular  in  the  doctor's  office. LIFE-N-POWER is a slow dissolving lozenge that releases its ingredients in the mouth so that they can be absorbed by the tiny sublingual capillaries.  The term "sublingual'' simply means "under the tongue."  The majority of the Vitamin B-12 and its metabolite, Dibencozide,  contained  in  LIFE-N-POWER  are absorbed this way, assuring much more reliable and consistent uptake in the body. The majority of the complex carbohydrate is also absorbed this way as well, providing more instant energy.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DIBENCOZIDE</H2>
<P>  Vitamin B-12, also known an Cobalamine or Cyanocobalamine, plays an important role in nucleic acid and protein synthesis as well as in nitrogen retention, cell division and growth. Target tissues include the central nervous system and skeletal muscle. The primary active form of Vitamin B-12 in the body is a coenzyme commonly called Dibencozide. The body stores the major portion of it vitamin B-12 in the form of Dibencozide and the Dibencozide form is retained in the body by as much as three times better.</P>

<P>  Dibencozide is directly involved in the body's building of muscle tissue. Many doctors specializing in sports  medicine  recommend  Dibencozide  as  a non-hormonal anabolic agent that is natural and effective in helping build strong muscles. It certainly offers the athlete a safe and effective alternative to steroid hormones and is not banned by the international sports community.</P>
<P.  As the metabolically active form of Vitamin B-12. Dibencozide supports protein synthesis, especially in the liver. As such, it has been recommended for individuals of all ages, especially in children and older individuals.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENERGY</H2>
<P>  Our bodies rely on carbohydrates for its primary fuel for energy.  Many people routinely experience drastic changes in blood sugar levels. The continual ingestion of simple carbohydrate (sugars) sensitize the pancreas to over produce insulin which results in low blood sugar levels. This  process  continues  with  time  until hypoglycemia and/or diabetes develops. However, the pancreas is able to handle more complex carbohydrates as they break down to their more simple components and do not create such a demand on the pancreas. LIFE-N-POWER contains complex carbohydrates that can easily and quickly be utilized by the body for energy, yet it does it safely, without the dangers of simple carbohydrate or sugars.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  LIFE-N-POWER is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE LIFE-N-POWER</H2>
 <P> As an energy boosting supplement, LIFE-N-POWER lozenges are simply dissolved slowly in the mouth whenever they are needed. They are useful as a "picker upper'' when dieting, working late, driving at night, or just for the afternoon "blahs." When used to help build muscle, it is best to make sure you take at least three tablets per day. Use them at workout times for energy and increased stamina. LIFE-N-POWER is helpful in maintaining blood sugar levels and each tablet only contains about two calories so they can be used by people wanting to lose weight, too.</P>

<BR><BR><BR>

Suggested Use:  One or two lozenges two dissolved slowly in the mouth, sublingually as desired.</P>

<H1>OXY-GEN CAPS: Stabilized Anaerocidal Atomic Oxygen</H1>

<HR>

<H3>Each Capsule Supplies:</H3>
<TABLE BORDER=10>

</TABLE>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MOST ABUNDANT ELEMENT </H2>

<P>   The earth is composed of over 100 elements and the most abundant of all of them is oxygen. Oxygen is absolutely essential for the existence of all living matter. We can go for weeks without food and days without water but we cannot live over four minutes without oxygen. There is no other substance on earth that we are so dependent on for our existence. In addition, all living matter contains oxygen, which is combined with other elements, not only as water in all cellular and circulatory fluids, but also as a component of all organic compounds such as carbohydrates (sugars, starches, cellulose, fiber), glycogen, fats and proteins.   Even the clay and rock structures of our soils are loaded with oxygen-containing compounds in the forms of oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, sulfates and others.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW DO WE GET IT?</H2>
P>   We mostly think of the oxygen in the air we breathe, but it is everywhere.  However, it is a major component in the water we drink and an ingredient of tens of thousands of different molecules that make up our foods. We breathe it, drink it and consume it in our food. Today, we can even supplement with it.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE KINDS OF OXYGEN</H2>
<P>   In its simplest form, oxygen is an atom that exists as one atom all by itself and is referred to just as "O" (singlet oxygen). The most well known and most common form of oxygen is when two atoms of oxygen combine to make molecular oxygen known as 02.</P>
<P>   Many attempts have been made by medical researchers to provide oxygen to the tissues of the body.   Hyperbaric chambers have been developed to put oxygen under pressure, forcing it into the tissues and blood stream.  Ozone is a very reactive form of oxygen that contains three atoms of oxygen and is symbolized by 03. Hydrogen peroxide has been given extensively, both orally and intravenously.</P>
<P>   However, magnesium peroxide is the form of choice today. The magnesium peroxide in Life Plus OXY-GEN CAPS is more stable than regular hydrogen peroxide and when it is utilized in the body it also provides the beneficial mineral, magnesium. Magnesium peroxide is also easier to handle and can be encapsulated in the dry form.  Life Plus OXY-GEN CAPS are an excellent method of supplementing the body with the quality oxygen needed for optimum health for energy, fighting infections and detoxifying.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FREE RADICAL FLAP</H2>
<P>   A commonly misunderstood aspect of hydrogen peroxide is that it is a free radical. This is simply not true. By definition, a free radical has an unpaired electron.  They are very short lived, usually only one ten-thousandth of a second.   If left unchecked, they can cause damage, but they also provide a much needed function in the body as well.  Therefore, balance is always the key. When hydrogen peroxide enters the blood stream, catalase enzyme immediately breaks it down into water and atomic or singlet oxygen. As mentioned above, this singlet oxygen does not exist long enough in the body to harm cells.  As a matter of fact, hydrogen peroxide is formed in the special white blood cells known as macrophages. They have a special enzyme called peroxisome, which produces hydrogen peroxide.  The singlet oxygen they produce literally kills invading bacteria as the singlet oxygen stimulates the oxidation-reduction cycle, which includes detoxification functions in the body as well as the destruction of anaerobic pathogens.</P>
<P>   Environmental contaminates in the air are not only harmful to every cell of our body, but also replaces the amount of oxygen percentage we breathe.  This can result in various problems such as a sense of fatigue, the inability to concentrate, repair of damaged cells and the inability to fight off infection and degenerative diseases, such as cancer and heart disease, the leading causes of death today.   Many researchers believe that the increased discomfort experienced by those suffering from arthritis before a storm or in more humid climates may result from a reduced amount of oxygen in the air.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> OXYGEN DEPLETION</H2>
 <P>  Several factors contribute to oxygen depletion. One of the most overlooked factors that may be contributing to the increased incidence of degenerative disease is the reduction of oxygen content of the air we breathe from about 35% to 19%. This is about a 50% reduction of the oxygen in the air around us.  Mineral deficiencies are another factor.  Minerals help inhibit the formation of toxins in our soils and the lack of minerals throws an extra burden on oxygen.  In addition, overeating can cause oxygen deficiency as more oxygen is required to complete the digestive process and additional metabolic waste.   Improper breathing contributes to the oxygen debt.  All infections reduce oxygen reserves, and researchers have shown that fluoride in our drinking water slows down the process of oxidation of our foods.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENERGY</H2>
<P>   Probably the most recognized result of decreased quality oxygen uptake in the body is the lack of energy and, on the other hand, increased energy levels are common place with higher levels. Even though the oxygen saturation in the veins of modern man is only 60-70%, some experts see a need for supplementing oxygen to supply up to the 80% range.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FORMULATION</H2>
<P>  Life Plus OXY-GEN CAPS are based on original research and formulation of Dr. Kurt W Donsbach, D.C., N.D., Ph.D. His famous oxygen-saturated aloe vera based formula is meticulously manufactured with cold processed aloe vera used as a stabilized carrier for numerous nutritional constituents, including magnesium peroxide and pure anaerocidal oxygen. Each OXY-GEN capsule contains singlet oxygen equivalent to twelve drops of 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide derived from magnesium peroxide and pure anaerocidal oxygen. It is formulated in a proprietary blend of herbs and herbal extracts of Ginkgo Biloba, Ginseng, Suma, Mint Tea, Bee Pollen, Citrus Pectin and Myrr.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUGGESTED USE</H2>
<P>  OXY-GEN CAPS are packaged in bottles of 64 capsules and are recommended to be taken two capsules at one time with water from one to three times per day as desired.  It is recommended that they be taken between meals away from food, at least one-half hour before meals or two hours after. This is simply to help provide for the most efficient absorption. Children usually take one capsule per day for each forty pounds of body weight.</P>


<P>Suggested Use: Two capsules one to three times per day with water as an oxygen supplement at least one-half hour away from food before meals or two hours after. Children usually take one capsule for each 40 pounds of body weight.</P>

<H1>CORRECTED SALT: Pleasant Tasting Balanced Condiment Containing Magnesium </H1>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR><BR><BR>
<H3>10 Shakes from an average salt shaaker equals approximately 1 gram of CORRECTED SALT and contains:</H3>
<TABLE BORDER=10>
<tr>
<td>Sodium 14.7 milliequivalents</td>
<td>Chloride 14.8 milliequivalents</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sulfur 0.16 milliequivalents</td>
<td>Magnesium 1.10 milliequivalents</td>

<td colspan=2>Pure Sodium Chloride and Elemental Magnesium as PolyMagPlex<sup>TM</sup> which is a proprietary blend of high quality magnesium sources including magnesium citrate, aspartate gluconate and glyerophosphate plus Sulfur and Sea Salt for trace amounts of other minerals.</td>
</tr>
</TABLE>


 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PLAQUE </H2>
<P>Hardening of the arteries is caused by a build-up of "plaque," a deposit made up of fats, cholesterols, proteins, minerals, especially calcium, toxins and heavy metals. Plaque reduces the size of the arteries, making it more difficult for the blood to flow through them properly. It reduces their elasticity. High blood pressure can result, and therefore the heart must work harder to pump our blood. Eventually, the heart wears out and serious health problems arise. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the Western World.</P>
<P>  Laboratory tests have shown that both table salt and regular salt substitutes contribute heavily to the build-up of plaque in the arteries.  Regular table salt contains sodium chloride and as many as forty other ingredients such as acids, sugar, silicates for flowing characteristics and others. Commercial salt substitutes usually contain potassium chloride plus the same additional ingredients contained in table salt. Both sodium chloride (when its effect is not offset with magnesium) and potassium chloride are strongly anabolic substances and their continued use can contribute heavily to the build-up of plaque in the blood vessels.  When people develop arterial plaque or when high blood pressure develops, the first thing their doctors tell them is to cut down their salt intake.</P>
<P> CORRECTED SALT is one of the most revolutionary  nutritional products ever developed.  Some of the negative effects of both sodium and chloride are balanced by a unique formula of magnesium and sulfur.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW CORRECTED SALT WORKS</H2>

<P> There are two  general  classifications  of normal chemical reactions in the body: (1)Anabolic, which are constructive and "build-up"; and (2) Catabolic, which break substances down. Research has proven that our metabolism shifts, or cycles back and forth, from anabolic to catabolic, depending on which type of reactions may be dominant in the body at that time.  To maintain optimum health, our metabolism should cycle back and forth daily. If it doesn't, certain conditions are more likely to develop if we are "stuck" in an anabolic mode, yet others are more likely to develop if we are catabolic most of the time.
 According to theory, the depositing of plaque in the arteries is an anabolic process, because it is characterized by a "build-up". It so happens that both sodium and chloride (the ingredients in table salt) are strongly anabolic and stimulate anabolic processes in the body. The same is true of potassium. Therefore, potassium chloride (the most common salt substitute) can be just as damaging.</P>
<P>  CORRECTED SALT contains a predetermined balance of both anabolic and catabolic minerals.  The anabolic  nutrients,  sodium  and  chloride  in CORRECTED SALT are balanced by the catabolic minerals, magnesium and sulfur. CORRECTED SALT also contains trace elements from natural sea salt.  It tastes like salt, because it contains salt; but instead of being heavily anabolic, it is balanced because of its formulation. You get the same great flavor of regular table salt but you don't have to be concerned about the bad effects of regular salt.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P> CORRECTED SALT is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus Phytozyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.  Other salt products contain numerous other ingredients, but CORRECTED SALT is 100% pure with only the PhytoZyme base added.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE CORRECTED SALT</H2>
<P>  CORRECTED SALT is intended to be used as you would normally use table salt. Simply throw out all your regular salt and fill your salt shakers with CORRECTED SALT. Use it in cooking or baking. It does not contain any preservatives, acids, starches or flowing agents. It has a tendency to "cake up" in high humidity after it has been opened. Therefore, it is recommended that you place it in a dry place. If it does cake up, simply place it in the oven (not the microwave) for a while to drive off the moisture. Then, simply break the clusters apart so it will flow through your salt shaker.</P>


<P>Suggested Use: Use freely as a condiment a the table or in cooking and baking as you would regular table salt.</P>

 <P>  Interest grew for researchers to study alkoxyglycerols because Scandinavian fisherman in the northern waters used to apply the oil from shark livers to cuts and other wounds while at sea because they healed quickly. They also began taking it internally when they were not feeling well.  Over a period of years, researchers have learned that the alkoxyglycerols in shark liver oil provided a fantastic immune supporting nutritional  effect.   It has  been  learned that when  larger quantities of it are used internally, care must be exercised to make  certain  that  the  levels  of  the  oil  soluble vitamins A and D are not concentrated in the final product. The concentrates used in the manufacturing of ALKO-MAR are of the highest quality and can be relied on to not contain significant amounts of these vitamins.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMMUNE SYSTEM </H2>

<P>  The immune system is a complex network of various defenses against harmful microorganisms of bacterial nature and other foreign substances that try to invade and affect the body in a negative way. It protects against such offenders as fungi and viruses and is also protective against aging along with other health providing factors. It is the immune systems job to neutralize and destroy any invading organism that could cause harm, either by infecting body tissues or by releasing poisons or toxins.</P>
<P>  The immune systems principal method of functioning is through its white blood cells. They are manufactured by the billions, primarily in bone marrow.  Unlike red blood cells, white cells can move on their own and are able to pass through the cell walls, allowing them to move rapidly to the site of infection or injury. There is basically two different types of them. They consist of the leukocytes that live in and travel through the blood stream and the lymphocytes which are found in the lymphoid tissue of the spleen, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow. There are two basic types of them, the B-lymphocytes and the T-lymphocytes. In general the T-lymphocytes are the most involved in fighting infections and diseases in the body.</P>
<P>   A primary benefit of the Alkoxyglycerols contained in ALKO-MAR is that they provide special nutrients that naturally support the body's immune system's ability to fight infections and degeneration.</P>
<P>  Lymphocytes destroy invaders by several methods including:  I)releasing antibodies that attach to the surface of invading proteins (called antigens) to neutralize them or make them easier to devour by the large scavenging cells known as macrophages, 2) ingesting them, or 3) releasing or causing surrounding cells to release enzymes or chemical agents such as histamines.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMMUNE MEMORY </H2>


<P>   One of the remarkable aspects of the immune system is its ability to recognize past invaders, allowing it to respond to a second attack quickly.  Disease causing viruses and bacteria
invade and reproduce rapidly, so this ability is extremely important.   After its first exposure to an antigen. certain lymphocytes become memory cells, which keep a blueprint of the invader. This is how immunizations work.  By exposing the immune system to small or non-active amounts of disease causing antigens, the immune system remembers how to respond at a later date and protects us if we are exposed at a later date.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> OTHERS </H2>

<P>  The immune system is equally involved in many other protective processes in the body such as its response to allergy producing substances, controlling the rate and aspects of aging, protection from free radicals and protection against degenerative diseases such as arthritis, cancer, arteriosclerosis and others. Probably the most well understood and studied is allergies and cancer.  Nutritionally supporting the immune system with natural substances like alkoxyglycerols has much more value then just helping the body fight off infections.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SOME DISORDERS </H2>

<P>   Many conditions associated with the malfunctioning of the immune system are much more well known today than ever before. AIDS, more completely known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, cancer, auto-immune disorders and allergic reactions. The primary problem with AIDS is that the immune system becomes so inefficient that the body becomes at an extreme risk to just about all other possible attacks including infections of all kinds.   Having one of these problems is indicative that the immune system is not working up to par.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANTIOXIDANTS </H2> 
<P>   The immune system is extremely sensitive to the need of antioxidant nutrients. Actually, it is the most sensitive system or organ in the body to their need. The immune status of any individual is a good indication of the status or need for antioxidants in their diet. The immune system is very sensitive to free radicals and cannot handle their attack as well as other functioning systems in the body. Supplementing with immune system supporting nutrients like ALKO-MAR is very synergistic with supplementing with other Life Plus immune supporting, antioxidant products such as <A HREF="mprotx.htm">PROTX II</A>,<A HREF="mcoq10.htm"> CO-Q-10 PLUS</A>,<A HREF="mcardio.htm"> CARDIO-CHELEX </A> and <A HREF="mopc.htm"> PROANTHENOLS.</A></P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE ALKO-MAR </H2> 
<P>  No specific number of ALKO-MAR capsules have been determined to take routinely. From one to three capsules are within the range.  It is a totally natural substance and larger amounts can be taken when needed. Taking more than twelve capsules (four capsules three times a day) is not productive. It is usually recommended to take between two and twelve capsules per day depending on the need.</P>



<BR><BR>
<P>Suggested Use: Take between one and twelve capsules throughout the day as desired.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMMUNE SYSTEM SUPPORT </H2>

<P>  COMBAT contains various concentrated tissue nutrients obtained from bovine tissues which  contain natural, proportionate amounts needed by the tissues of our immune system. They are very synergistic with the other nutrients in COMBAT.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE STRATEGY BEHIND COMBAT</H2>
<P>  The Thymus gland plays a major role in the action of the immune system.  The Thymus both produces and activates T-cells, or T-Lymphocytes, which travel through the lymphatic system, destroying bacteria and some larger viruses when we are invaded. Quite often people get swollen lymph nodes when infection is present in the body due to this activity.</P>
<P>  The Adrenal glands play an important role in the stress that we are exposed to, including colds, flu and other kinds of infections. The Spleen is also involved in the protective mechanisms maintained by the body. The Life  Plus  formulation  in  COMBAT  contains concentrated tissue nutrients from Thymus, Adrenal and Spleen to supply many of the micronutrients they need to function efficiently.</P>
<P>  COMBAT also contains substantial amounts of both Vitamin A in the form of regular natural Vitamin A and its precursor, Beta-Carotene. Vitamin A helps to maintain the integrity of the mucous membranes that are a part of the linings of the sinuses, lungs and other parts of the respiratory system. It is important to maintain them as they are the first line of the body's defense against air born infections that attack through the respiratory system.</P>
<P>  During   allergy   attacks   or  colds,   these tissues often become irritated and secrete more than normal amounts of mucous and fluid. Actually, mucous secretion is the way the body protects itself by "washing away" contaminants.  This fluid contains significant amounts of the lysozyme enzyme that kills harmful bacteria.  Since people generally find this condition of excess mucous production undesirable, they often take antihistamine drugs to counteract the mucous secretion. Usually, these drugs dry up the mucous too much, prevent the body from protecting itself and actually slow down the healing process.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VITAMIN C</H2>
<P>   Vitamin C is thought to be a natural antihistamine that does not have the side effects of many synthetic drugs. Vitamin C also helps the white blood cells fight bacteria. Like vitamin A, it is a natural antioxidant which ensures that oxygen is available to the cells for metabolism and fighting infection. It is thought by many researchers that vitamin C can prevent certain viruses from multiplying.</P>
<P>  COMBAT contains Propolis, nature's own antibiotic. It is obtained from beehives and is a product that honey bees produce to protect the hive from infectious invaders. They wall off the area with Propolis as it is well known that infectious bacteria cannot penetrate it.  COMBAT also contains Bee Pollen, which has the reputation of supporting the immune system.</P>
<P>  In addition, COMBAT contains Garlic and Cayenne herbs, which have been used for centuries to fight infection naturally and to detoxify the body.  Pleurisy Root, Echinacea and Yarrow are other herbs included in COMBAT for their abilities to support the immune and respiratory systems.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  COMBAT is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE COMBAT</H2>
<P>  There are no set amounts of COMBAT to take but it is recommended to take several tablets the first day or two when early signs are noticed. Usually, two to four tablets every hour for the first day and decrease from there.</P>
<P>  
Suggested Use:  Two or more tablets, three or more times a day.  More tablets should be taken at first 
signs of need.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBALS </H2>

<P>   Herbs have been used since creation to provide for the health and well being of entire civilizations. The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage.  Mainstream modern technology is now beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies. This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy. We probably will never understand many of the secrets regarding the way in which many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason not to take advantage of their benefits.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal-based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals.  These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and, at times, concentrated tissue nutrients. By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal-based products are second-to-none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DETOXIFICATION</H2>
<P>   The two primary organs of metabolic detoxification in the body are the liver and the kidneys. The liver filters pollutants out of the blood and dumps many of them into the digestive tract by secreting them through the bile.  One problem is that many of the toxins are reabsorbed in the intestinal tract back into our system.</P>
<P>  PARATOX contains two amino acids, Methionine and Cysteine.  These wonderful natural substances are not only essential to life and an important component of the proteins in our bodies,  they also support proper liver function and cleanse the body. They contain a sulfhydryl grouping in their molecules,  which  contain  sulfur  having  a  chelating capacity that binds toxins and helps the body eliminate them.</P>
<P>   Also included with the amino acids is Alginate, an herbal extract  obtained  from  seaweed.    As  the  Alginate contained in PARATOX is swallowed and passes through the digestive tract, it naturally binds with toxic metals like aluminum, strontium, tin, cadmium, mercury and lead that are often secreted into the digestive tract through the bile. Then, since our bodies cannot absorb Alginate (particularly when it is complexed with the heavy metals) into the body, it passes through and is excreted, taking the heavy metals with it.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PARASITES</H2>
<P>  Many people often find it amusing when they hear they may have worms or other parasites.   Yet this problem is very prevalent all over the world. We routinely worm our horses, cattle, dogs, cats and other animals but few think to care for themselves in the same manner.</P>
<P>   A parasite, by definition, lives off of other living things. The parasites that infest our bodies not only live off the nutrients in the foods we eat but they actually live off our tissues.   They  secrete  toxins  into our bloodstream that circulate  and  often  cause  damage. One  factor  not normally considered is that they are a constant drain on our immune systems.</P>
<P>  Parasites can be obtained from the leaves of certain vegetables, from the stools of pets, such as dogs and cats, horses, cows and other farm livestock and from meat that hasn't been cooked adequately to kill them off.  It has been shown that it is impossible to kill some of the parasites in pork by cooking.  Many water supplies in countries around the world are definite sources of parasites, so those who travel should definitely take precaution.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TWELVE SPECIAL HERBS</H2>
<P>   A substance taken to expel or control parasites (most often referred  to  as  "worms")  is  technically  called  a "vermifuge." The unique combination of the twelve special herbs in PARATOX are great as a natural supplement. They include Black Walnut, Wormwood, Garlic, Parsley, Fenugreek, Alginate,  Goldenseal,  Norwegian  Kelp,  Cayenne  and Chlorophyll.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  PARATOX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE PARATOX</H2>
 <P>  In most cases, Paratox does not need to be taken daily on an on-going basis. It is usually recommended to take a round of PARATOX once a quarter (every three months).  The regimen is to take one or two bottles each cleansing. The first time you take PARATOX, take two bottles and then one bottle is usually adequate for repeat usages.</P>
<P>   On day one, take one tablet three times a day. On day two, take two tablets three times a day. On day three, take three tablets three times a day. On day four, take four tablets three times a day. Stay at this level until one or two bottles are used. Some individuals may develop a feeling of the "blahs" as the toxins are coming out of their body. If this happens to you, just decrease the dosage.  This feeling should subside as your system is cleansed. If you travel to other countries, it is a good idea to take one or two tablets three times a day, using a full bottle, while you travel.</P>
<P>   It is strongly recommended that you drink plenty of fluids while taking PARATOX to help your body eliminate toxins. Good pure water is best, but some fruit or vegetable juice is acceptable as well. Avoid alcohol, milk and soft drinks during this time.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<p>Suggested Use: One to three tablets three times per day.</P>

<BR><BR>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGE </H2>
<P>Younger men are more likely to be affected than most people realize. Pre-cancerous lesions have been found in men who have died in accidents as young as 20 years of age. Over 25% of the men autopsied who have died in their 30's were found to be affected and over 55% of them in their 40's.</P>
<P>  Even though prostate cancer is slow growing, it is always better to have an early diagnosis.
   It is surprising that less than half of the men over the age of 40 have ever had the traditional digital exam that is recommended by both general practitioners and urologists. The lack of early diagnosis is one reason why as many as 60% of the cases that are diagnosed have already spread. The newer PSA Test (prostate specific antigen test) is a blood test that result in more cases being diagnosed sooner.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THREE CATEGORIES</H2>
  <P>The prevalence of this condition is not well known. As a matter of fact, a survey has revealed that as many as 11% of American men were unaware that they even had a prostate gland.   Needless to say, the symptoms of prostate trouble are even  less well  known.   The conditions are usually categorized into one of three; 1) prostatitis (inflamed prostate), 2) benign prostatic hypertrophy (BHP), and 3) prostate cancer. Prostatitis is usually a result of an infection but quite often is thought to be caused by stress. Infections are usually treated with antibiotics  or  other  anti-infectives,  while  cases associated with stress are usually treated with muscle relaxants or exercise.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BHP</H2>
<P>  In cases of BHP, the gland may grow many times its normal size, say from the size of a walnut, possibly in a young man in his 20's or early 30's, to as large as an orange or grapefruit in his 50's. Most researchers agree that this growth, at least in part, is associated with the male hormone testosterone or its metabolites. Although not malignant, BHP can be very uncomfortable as over growth of the prostate usually causes physical blockage of the urethra.  This results in urinary tract problems because the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder, travels through the middle of the prostate and can become blocked by the overgrowth of prostate tissue.  Also, bladder and kidney infections, as well as increased frequency of urination and discomfort, can result.</P>

<P>  Several different surgical techniques have been developed that remove all or some of the prostate tissue when used in the treatment of BHP and prostate cancer. Even though they can be life prolonging and go a long way to relieve pain and discomfort, they are not without their side effects and limitations.   More recently, the importance of diet and exercise has come to light.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HIGH FAT DIETS</H2>
<P>  High fat diets have been linked to both BHP and prostate cancer. Autopsies have shown that cases of BHP have greatly increased the amount of cholesterol in their prostate tissues. It has also been shown that increasing body weight increases the incidence of prostate cancer. Moderately overweight men have more than double the risk, while those truly obese are four times more likely to develop the disease. Other studies have shown that men with prostate cancer consume more meat and dairy products. The incidence of prostate cancer goes up with decreased Vitamin A consumption and with increased exposure to Cadmium.</P>
<P>   Reduced activity and lack of exercise are also culprits in this whole scenario.  The Missouri Cancer Registry found that by studying 17,000 men with occupations that required a lot of physical activity had a lower incidence of prostate cancer.  In another study involving 18,000 men who burned 4,000 calories or more by weekly exercising reduced their risk of prostate cancer by up to over 85% when compared to men who used less than 1,000 calories by exercising per week.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBS </H2>

<P>   Herbs have been used since creation to provide for our health and well being, for entire civilizations for that matter.  The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage. Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies. This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy. We probably never will understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits now.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals. These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and concentrated tissue nutrients  in  select  products.  By  combining  modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal based products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NUTRITION FOR THE EYES</H2>
<P>  Life  Plus  EYE  FORMULA  is  formulated  to nutritionally support the tissues of the eyes and other tissues.  Every year millions of people lose their sight to conditions such as macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts and retinal hemorrhages.</P>
<P>  Few people stop to think how our eyes are bombarded each day by air pollution, chemicals, drugs, certain cosmetics, fumes from solvents and cigarette smoke. Thus, it is imperative that we support our eyes nutritionally, if we want to use them for a whole lifetime.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NIGHT BLINDNESS AND VITAMIN A</H2>
<P>  One of the most common vision problems people have today is night blindness.  Vitamin A is actually a cure for this condition. EYE FORMULA contains 500 international units of Vitamin A in its natural precursor form, Beta-Carotene.  Ideally, more should be taken for this specific application, but only 500 international units are included in EYE FORMULA to not over supplement for individuals who are obtaining it from other supplements. However, the representative amount in EYE FORMULA ensures that it is present and available to the eyes when the other nutrients in this great product are present to provide its synergistic effect.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CIRCULATION AND EYES</H2>
<P>  Most eye problems associated with degeneration are related to circulation impairment in some way.   The decrease in blood supply is responsible for a lack of both oxygen and needed nutrients reaching our tissues.  In addition, end products of metabolism can build up and result in toxemia.   This  situation can be especially damaging to the eyes as oxygen levels are very critical to their delicate tissues. It has been shown, for instance, that decreased levels of Glutathione in the ocular tissues are associated with the existence of cataracts.</P>
<P>  The Eyebright herb in Life Plus EYE FORMULA is a very important ingredient and has been used as a valuable nutritional supplement for years, especially in Europe.  It has not only been taken whole, but made into tinctures, fluid extracts and even poultices that were applied topically.</P>
<P>  Bioflavonoids are compounds that occur in nature with Vitamin C. The Rutin and Hesperidin contained in Life Plus EYE FORMULA are known to  help maintain the integrity of the thousands of tiny blood vessels, called capillaries, in the eye. These two specific bioflavonoids are known to be especially beneficial for the eyes.</P>
<P>   Macular degeneration is a condition of the eyes that is characterized by a gradual decreased ability to see. Eyebright herb and Vitamin A combined with improved circulation can be very helpful.  Eyebright herb and the natural tri-peptide, Glutathione, is a unique synergistic nutritional  supportive  combination  for  the  eyes. Glutathione is a special natural substance that is present in all  normal  cells, especially ocular tissue that contain sulfur.   It is a great anti-oxidant and detoxifier and is thought to be helpful in the prevention of cataracts. Concentrated tissue nutrients from bovine ophthalmic and brain tissues are also included for their overall synergistic effects in the nutritional support for the healthy metabolic processes of eye tissue.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  EYE FORMULA is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE EYE FORMULA</H2>
<P>  It is usually recommended that you take one or two tablets three times a day as a natural nutritional supplement for the eyes. For optimum results, take Life Plus   EYE   FORMULA   with  <A HREF="msoma.htm"> SOMAZYME</A>, <A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS</A> and additional vitamin A and C (usually from <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO CHELEX</A> ).</P>
Suggested Use:  One or two tablets three times a day as a natural supplement for the eyes. </P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE FORMULA </H2>

<P>  Life Plus PANCREAS FORMULA is specifically formulated to nutritionally support the pancreas in a unique way. PANCREAS FORMULA contains herbs, enzymes, vitamins, minerals and concentrated tissue nutrients for their synergistic nutritional effect in support of proper pancreas function.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE PANCREAS & DIGESTION</H2>
<P>  The pancreas is one of the most important organs in our bodies. We can't live without it. It performs many functions that are important and are interrelated with the activities of many other organs of the endocrine system. In general, the pancreas has two major functions (1) enzyme production for digestion, and (2) insulin production  for  the  regulation  of  carbohydrate metabolism.</P>
<P>  In order to digest the food we eat, the pancreas produces  numerous  enzymes. They  include various  proteolytic  enzymes  such  as  trypsin, chymotrypsin and others that break down proteins. It also secretes lipases, which break down fats and amylases which break down complex carbohydrates in the form of starches and other large carbohydrate molecules.</P>
<P>  It used  to be thought that all of these  digestive enzymes were used up or excreted. We know now that many of them are reabsorbed into the bloodstream, where they are carried throughout the body for other purposes, such as the digestion of blood clots and foreign fats and proteins in the blood. For instance, trypsin and chymotrypsin keep the proteolytic activity in the blood to a healthy level and maintain a proper balance in the breaking down of fibrin in blood clots and other areas in the circulatory system.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE PANCREAS & INSULIN</H2>
 <P>  The special cells in the pancreas, called the Islets of Langerhans, produce insulin and secrete it into the blood stream. Insulin is the primary regulator of carbohydrate metabolism in the body.   When we eat simple carbohydrates (sugars) they are absorbed directly into the blood stream relatively quickly. When we eat complex carbohydrates (starches and others), it is digested (broken down) into its component smaller units and eventually into glucose which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. The pancreas senses the level of glucose in the blood and produces insulin accordingly. Insulin then helps the glucose enter the cells, where it is used for energy production. If too much insulin is produced, not enough glucose remains in the blood and if too little is produced, too much glucose remains in the blood and not enough enters the cells.</P>
<P>   If the pancreas is overworked and does not receive the nutrients it needs to maintain its own healthy metabolic processes, it can become exhausted and not produce enough insulin. The result can be diabetes. If, on the other hand, too much insulin is produced, the blood sugar level will be too low. This condition is called hypoglycemia.  Therefore, maintaining the proper balance is important.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT PANCREAS FORMULA DOES</H2>
<P>  PANCREAS FORMULA provides nutrients that the pancreas needs to function properly. It contains Zinc, which is needed in the manufacture of insulin and copper to help maintain proper zinc levels. It contains Chromium, which is essential to the action of insulin at the cell level. Since the pancreas is made of epithelial tissue, it needs vitamin A to remain healthy. Because the (duodenum) and liver work so closely with the pancreas, concentrated tissue nutrients from them and from bovine pancreas are included as well. In addition, two highly active enzyme concentrates from pancreas, pancreatin and (pancrelipase) are important ingredients in Life Plus PANCREAS FORMULA.  They supplement with enzymes which makes it possible for the pancreas gland to rest from the demand placed on it.</P>
 <P> The three valuable synergistic herbs, Dandelion, Goldenseal and Chickweed are also included for their synergistic effects.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  Life Plus PANCREAS FORMULA is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE PANCREAS FORMULA </H2>
<P>Take one or two tablets three times per day. It is a good idea for those with sugar metabolism difficulties to take before or between meals as nutritional support for the pancreas.   It can be taken at mealtime for the digestive  value  of the  enzymes  in  PANCREAS FORMULA. The Life Plus products <A HREF="msoma.htm">SOMAZYME</A>,<A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT  TABS</A>  and  <A HREF= "mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS</A> are great synergistic products to take with PANCREAS FORMULA.</P>

Suggested Use:  One or two tablets three times a day. </P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> EPA PLUS </H2>


<P>  According to studies published in the well respected British scientific journal, Lancet, the incidence of heart disease related to atherosclerosis, including coronary artery disease, in Greenlandic Eskimos is extremely low. From 1963 to 1967 only three cases of these diseases were reported in the entire Eskimo population of Greenland.  Moreover, not a single established case of diabetes is known to have been reported in the population of the Greenlandic Uhanak district. Since diabetes and heart disease affected literally millions of Americans in the  1980's and  1990's, the lack of heart disease in Eskimos and other societies has attracted the serious attention of many scientists around the world.</P>
<P>  The   food   of  the   Greenlandic   Eskimos consists largely of meat from whales, seals, sea birds and fish (usually halibut and salmon).  Needless to say, their food is extremely rich in protein and fat and low in carbohydrates, but it is extremely high in the Omega-3 Polyunsaturates EPA and DHA as contained in Life Plus EPA PLUS.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> EPA</H2>
<P>   Doctors have been saying for years that large amounts of fat in the diet can lead to heart disease and other disorders.  Why, therefore, can a group of people who consume such large amounts of protein and fat have such low incidence of atherosclerotic heart disease?  Until recently, scientists have been baffled by this important question. The new link in their chain of understanding now centers around a marine lipid concentrate, containing Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA).</P>
<P>  EPA is a direct source of an important substance called prostaglandin F3. Prostaglandin E3 is directly responsible for making blood platelets (cells which form a "plug" wherever an injury occurs) less sticky, thus leading to an easier flow of blood throughout out- bodies.  This natural antithrombotic "anti-clotting" effect of` EPA has been well researched. This means that EPA is intimately involved in bodily processes that inhibit  blood  clots  (obstructions  to  circulation), particularly in the small capillaries of the heart. When a small blood vessel is injured, platelets adhere to each other around the edges of the injury, forming a clot. This is a natural protective mechanism that prevents us from literally bleeding to death.</P>
<P>  However, when platelets in the blood become too sticky,  they  can  clump  abnormally  fast  and  too frequently.  This rapid and extensive platelet clumping can actually inhibit circulation and be a major contributor to heart and circulatory disease.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DHA</H2>
<P>  Of almost equal importance, but not as widely researched, is Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA).   It comprises a significant amount of the tissue, which makes up our brains as well as a large part of the retina of the eye.</P>
<P>  The average American diet is very low in fresh fish and derivatives of sea food that contain EPA and DHA. On the other hand, it is high in refined carbohydrates and saturated fats.  This kind of diet can lead to a serious deficiency in the raw materials necessary for proper platelet function in our blood stream.  Recent dietary studies suggest that marine lipid complexes that contain EPA and DHA can have a very significant effect on lowering unwanted "blood fats." They may prove to be extremely useful natural substances powerful enough to normalize the high cholesterol and triglyceride levels that are so extensive in our modern American population.</P>
<P>  Supplementing with EPA PLUS is a rational approach to naturally increasing the amount of Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Docosahexaenoic Acid in our daily diets. This product represents a significant advantage over other marine oils, which can supply a potentially toxic amount of Vitamins A and D, while supplying lower amounts of EPA and DHA factors.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE EPA PLUS</H2>
<P>  It is recommended to take one or two capsules with the two major meals each day.  Many individuals also take EPA PLUS with the third meal as well. It is wise to limit the amount of saturated fat in your diet and increase the amount of high quality cold water fish.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: One to two capsule two or three times per day with meals.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>PROGESTERONE OVERLOOKED</H2>
  Thousands of women in the western world are now using natural progesterone, generally in the form of a non-prescription product that is applied to the skin. They consistently not only claim less "female" symptoms, but experience increased vitality, better skin and a renewed emotional balance.  Natural progesterone has unfortunately been almost totally overlooked by medical science while the erroneous focus has been placed heavily (almost completely) on estrogen. It is important in this modem day for us to have a much better understanding of progesterone, the important natural hormone that it is.<P><P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>PRECURSOR</H2>
   It has been little realized that progesterone, like DHEA, has been referred to as the "mother of hormones." Progesterone is an important  precursor  in  the  biosynthesis  of  the  adrenal corticosteroids, which protect us against stress, and of all the sex hormones, including both testosterone and estrogen. This means that progesterone can be turned into one of many different hormones in the body as they are needed to maintain various metabolic functions in almost all of our tissues.  Unfortunately, most all the emphasis has been put on the importance of estrogen. However, it must be emphasized again that both estrogen and testosterone are made from progesterone.  Without adequate progesterone, both testosterone and estrogen would not be sufficiently available to the body.<P><P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>ESTROGEN DOMINANCE</H2>
   About 600,000 hysterectomies are performed every year in the USA alone.  According to Dr. Stanley West, noted fertility specialist and chief of reproductive endocrinology at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York and author of The Hysterectomy Hoax, about 90 percent of all hysterectomies are unnecessary. Dr. John Lee, long time medical practitioner and researcher of progesterone, has discovered a consistent theme running through women's complaints associated with PMS and menopause. That is, they experience estrogen dominance or put another way, they have too much estrogen in relationship to the amount of progesterone in their bodies.<P><P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>HRT</H2><P>
   These women, contrary to their actual needs, are given synthetic estrogen drugs.  In other words, when their estrogen levels are already too high when compared with progesterone levels, they are given more estrogen. It has become mainstream in modern medical practice to prescribe estrogen for menopausal and related symptoms.  This is referred to as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) by doctors.  The delicate estrogen/progesterone balance is greatly upset by too much estrogen, so progesterone deficiency is exaggerated all the more. Doctors have been able to balance the estrogen-dominance effect through with progesterone.<P><P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>NATURAL PROGESTERONE<P></H2>
   Between 40 and 60 percent of all western women experience premenstnral syndrome(PMS). Natural progesterone is made from wild yams or soybeans, whose active ingredients are an exact molecular match of the body's own progesterone. It is interesting to note that in countries in Asia and South America, where women eat quantities of either wild yams or soybeans, the term "hot flash" doesn't even exist in their languages. They also rarely experience most of the female problems plaguing western women.  One researcher, Jerilyn Prior, chief endocrinologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine, has demonstrated that osteoporosis occurs in athletes to the degree that they become progesterone deficient. She became convinced that loss of bone density (osteoporosis) could be the result of progesterone deficiency. This was later confirmed by a three year study including sixty-three post-menopausal women.
   Natural progesterone supplementation is not known to have any side effects and no toxic levels have been found to date.  When adequate levels of progesterone are present in the body, libido is increased, the skin stays hydrated and oxygenated, facial hair growth and hair thinning is prevented, less depression occurs, fat burning is encouraged and blood clotting remains normal. There appears to be less breast and uterine cancer among women with higher levels of progesterone as well as less menopausal and PMS problems, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness.<P><P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>SYNTHETIC ESTROGEN & PROGESTINS<P></H2>
  A New England Journal of Medicine article in 1995 involving 121,700 women revealed that women who used synthetic estrogens and progestins to offset the symptoms of menopause also increased their chance of developing breast cancer by up to 40 percent by taking them for more than five years.   Current knowledge is evolving that these synthetic products are not good. Not only are synthetic estrogens responsible for increasing the probability of breast and uterine cancer, but also of increased storage of body fat, fluid retention, depression, headaches, impaired blood sugar control, reduced oxygen in cells, gallbladder problems, decreased sex drive, increased probability of fibroids and bone loss.
   The attempt to offset the negative effects of synthetic estrogen with synthetic progestins, only complicates the problems all the more.  It is important to know that the group of drugs that are referred to as progestins  are not progesterone.   They  are compounds that have altered molecules of progesterone that can be patented by companies for profit.  Synthetic progestins are not exact replicas of progesterone and can cause numerous side effects, such as headache, depression, fluid retention, increased risk of birth defects (they are included in birth control pills), liver dysfunction, breast tenderness, acne, insomnia, swelling, weight changes and PMS-like symptoms. They are not progesterone!<P><P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBALS </H2>

<P>Herbs have been used since creation to provide for our health and well being, for entire civilizations for that matter. The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage. Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies.  This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy. We probably will never understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals. These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals,  amino  acids,  enzymes,  bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and concentrated tissue nutrients in select products.  By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal based products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>
<P>  Women, more so than men, are troubled with dynamic changes of the hormone levels in their bodies from day to day and almost moment to moment. Actually, the female endocrine system is always in a state of change, beginning with the first day of each month's cycle and continuing through the last, then the cycle starts all over gain. The herbs in INNER MAGIC F are known for their value in helping to balance the female hormonal system nutritionally.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FEMALE IMBALANCES</H2>
<P>  Symptoms of female imbalances are certainly wide and varied. It is staggering to think that more than 70% of women over the age of 35 have had some kind of hysterectomy.</P>
<P>  Hysterectomy usually results in many sudden hormone changes. When the ovaries are removed, a woman is in instant menopause, a condition wherein the ovaries stop producing estrogen. When this occurs, the adrenals normally take up the slack. However, with most menopausal women, their adrenals have been under so much stress that the adrenals are exhausted.</P>
<P>  The Life Plus INNER MAGIC F formula, as its name suggests, is formulated for special nutritional support for women.  INNER MAGIC F contains nutrients from twelve different herbs including Damiana, Cumin, Norwegian Kelp, Myrrh, Sarsaparilla, Buchu Leaves, Cayenne, Dong Quai, Saw Palmetto, Squaw Vine, Cramp Bark and False Unicorn.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  INNER MAGIC F is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE INNER MAGIC F</H2>
<P>  Most women find that INNER MAGIC F is valuable throughout the whole month, not just during that special time each month. The recommended dosage is two tablets twice a day, morning and evening. When special needs arise, more can be taken.</P>

<P>
Suggested Use:  Two tablets two times a day preferably before meals.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ESPECIALLY FOR MEN </H2>

<P>  INNER MAGIC M is the male counterpart to INNER MAGIC E It is the most popular product of its kind on the market.</P>
 <P> While it is common knowledge that women are troubled with hormone imbalances, the same is true with men. We live in a world full of stress. Most men's work days are loaded with stressful situations.  They are usually required to travel more, eat on the run, start early and stop late. Good nutrition often takes a back seat. These factors set them up for trouble. The male gonadal system is designed to help men handle these kinds of situations.   INNER MAGIC M is the ideal way to supplement with herbs known to be nutritionally supportive of the male endocrine system.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT INNER MAGIC M DOES</H2>
<P>  INNER MAGIC M contains a unique blend of special herbs to nutritionally support the proper metabolic activities of the primary glands of the male endocrine system: the adrenals, the pituitary and the testicles. Supporting the pituitary seems to help fight stress. The testicles produce testosterone, which is the hormone primarily responsible for the maintenance of the physical male sex characteristics. Testosterone works in men like estrogen works in women. If the production of testosterone decreases, sex drive is diminished and infertility can even result.   It is also an important hormone in the conversion of fat to muscle tissue and seems to be associated with the more aggressive nature of most men. Low levels of testosterone in middle aged men have been shown to be at least partially responsible for lack of libido and general malaise.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMBALANCES</H2>
<P>  Symptoms of male hormone imbalance are many and quite often overlooked.  They include decreased sperm production,  diminished  sexual  desire,  impotency, nervousness, anxiety, mood changes, headache and loss of lean muscle mass.</P>
<P>   The male prostate gland is also important to fertility. It manufactures most of the fluids, buffers and enzymes in  semen.   By  age  50,  men  have  a 20%  risk of developing an enlarged, or inflamed prostate and by the age of  60 the chances are better than 50%. The prostate gland lies around the part of the urethra where it is attached to the bladder.</P>
 <P> When male hormone levels decrease with age, minute tissue changes occur similar to some of the changes in women during menopause. The prostate usually enlarges and becomes more firm. It pushes against the bladder and restricts the urethra. Men with this problem usually have to urinate frequently and then only with difficulty. Because of restricted flow, the urine also becomes concentrated in the bladder, and irritation and infection can result.</P>
<P>  The Life Plus INNER MAGIC M formula, as its name suggests, is formulated for special nutritional support for men.  Its unique formulation contains twelve special herbs chosen for their special synergistic nutritional effects.   They include Norwegian Kelp, Siberian Ginseng, Myrrh, Fennel, Parsley, Sarsaparilla (Smilax). Saw Palmetto Extract, Yohimbe PE, Juniper Berries, Gravel Root, Cayenne and Chlorophyll.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  INNER MAGIC M is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you receive the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE INNER MAGIC M</H2>
 <P> Most men find that INNER MAGIC M is a valuable specific male herbal supplement, no matter what their age.  It is not just for later years.   The usual recommended dosage is two tablets twice per day, morning and evening. When special needs arise, more can be taken. It is the ideal product for men to add to their <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A> daily multiple supplement regime to tailor it specifically as part of a male supplement program.</P>

<P>
Suggested Use:  Two tablets two times a day preferably before meals.</P>

<H3><A NAME="acne">ACNE</A></H3>
<P>
After suffering for 19 years with acne, I stumbled upon the cure:
Acidophilus <A HREF="msali.htm">(SALIVAREX) </A>(among other friendly 
bacteria), but I wanted you to know that there is definitely a connection 
between acne and a deficiency of friendly bacteria.

I intend to spread this information as far and wide as I can.  Modern
dermatologists are not using this info for their patients.  This must
change.

<H3><A NAME="arthritis">ARTHRITIS</A></H3>
<P>
I have had arthritis in my knees for about 8 years. It got so bad I had to 
take an early retirement on a medical disability. The doctor had me on the 
prescription Predizone (of course it has some nasty side effects). I have 
been taking the <A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS OPC-85</A> for about 7 months now. I have more 
energy than I have had at anytime during the last three years.  I used to 
have to take a nap once a day, I know longer need this as I have much more 
energy. I am able to walk much better now with virtually no pain. 
<A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS OPC-85 </A> has been a God send.</P>
<P>
James E. </P><BR>

<P>
I am feeling a lot better myself since taking <A HREF="mopc.htm">
PROANTHENOLS OPC-85 </A>. My arthritic leg has been feeling much better 
with less and less pain killer needed to function.

I hope that I can share this wonderful product with others. I have been 
talking about our personal health results.

even close my hand. After using <A HREF="mwonder.htm"> WONDER GEL, </A> 
just a couple of days, they have already started to improve. Now they don't
hurt any more and I can make a fist once again. You can bet i will never be
without it!

For many years, I have had problems sleeping. I would fall asleep and
sleep throughout the night, but wake up feeling exhusted! It did not matter
how long I slept, I would never have much energy during the day, and needed
frequent naps. I then began taking <A HREF="mmel.htm"> Somniset</A>, and 
almost immediately began to notice that I woke up feeling refreshed! It was
like being a kid again! I do not even get tired during the day anymore.
<A HREF="mmel.htm"> Somniset</A> works!

I had been taking a highly addictive sleeping medication called Xanax
for over a year. I first started out on Xanax with only 2mg, however,
by the time I was introduced to Life Plus I was taking 15 to 30mg of
Xanax every night, and by 2:00 in the morning I'd be awake and done sleeping
for the night.<P>
When I got my <A HREF="mmel.htm"> Somniset</A>, I started out with one, then
two or more. I found that what worked best for me was three tablets 45
minutes before I go to bed. I sleep all through the night, and wake in the
morning refreshed and just raring to go. <A HREF="mmel.htm"> Somniset</A>
has changed my life!

I thought I would share with you some of my results on the 
<A HREF="moxygen.htm">Oxy-Gen Caps.</A> I run for exercise, generally 30 to 
50 miles per week.  The third morning on Life Plus products, I had taken my 
<A HREF="moxygen.htm">Oxy-Gen Caps</A> early before I started running.  By 
the time I had passed the third or fourth mile, I thought I was on rocket 
fuel!  I could not believe the improved energy and endurance 
that I had.  But one thing in particular impressed me:  I felt I had a 
clarity and a clearness of thought that I hadn't had for a long time.  I 
have now been on Life Plus products for seven weeks, taking 
<A HREF="mopc.htm">Proanthenols</A>, <A HREF="mmicro.htm">Micro-Mins,</A>
<A HREF="mtvm.htm"> TVM-49,</A> <A HREF="mprotx.htm"> ProtxII </A> and

impressed me.  Thanks for developing a superior product line.

more upbeat , energetic and positive throughout the day. Micro-Mins are

At Christmas my brothers and sisters, and their families had met at my 
parents. The next day and for several days thereafter one by one virtually 
everyone in my family had gotten sick, started vomiting and had various 
symptons of some virus. With a couple of exceptions: my mother, wife and 
myself. We had one thing in common, we had all been taking 
<A HREF="mcombat.htm">COMBAT </A>from Life Plus. I continued to take it 
all winter and did not get one single cold. This is one great product. I

<H3><A NAME="ind">INDIGESTION/HEARTBURN</A></H3>
<P>
I personally know several  people who have had bad stomach (indigestion) 
problems who the doctor had on an expensive prescription ($80.00 a bottle).
Within one week of taking <A HREF="msust.htm">SUSTENASE </A>they stopped 
taking their prescription.
I had been seeing a doctor for severe stomach problems and indigestion,
the doctor had been giving me this expensive prescription medicine. The 
medicine wasn't working very well as I was in severe discomfort. The doctor 
said there wasn't anything more he could do for me.  Then I was introduced 
to <A HREF="msust.htm">SUSTENASE, </A>this product has been a virtual 
miracle for me, as I no longer suffer from indigestion or heartburn. 
Now when I see ads on TV for indigestion and stomach remedies I laugh 
but I also get mad, as I feel these companies are conning the American 
public. These products advertised only mask the real problem which is 
improper digestion, and their remedy is to give you a product which 
prevents the stomach from producing what it is supposed to - stomach acid, 
which is needed for proper digestion. This is criminal, I believe every 
adult should take this product, it is phenomenol.</P>

 A woman in our church had been seeing a Doctor and getting  prescriptions 
for her stomach problems. She took <A HREF="msust.htm">SUSTENASE </A>for 1 
week and has thrown her prescription medicine in the garbage. This is one 
excited woman. She commented "I ate Mexican food for the first time in 
three years". This is an excellent product for heartburn and indigestion. 
Antacids only relieve the symptoms  - this product actually helps you to 
digest your food better. </P>

I`m a waitress and someone up here gave me a bottle of <A HREF="msilva.htm">
Colloidal Silver </A>after I was told by my doctor that I had a 
serious viral infection. I used the product and went back to my doctor.  
He couldn`t believe it. I`m living proof.  I know it helped save my life.</P>

We have had instant success with <A HREF="msilva.htm">Colloidal Silver </A>
and immune compromised patients.  A few examples are: Pink eye (topical) 
totally resolved in less than six hours; Re-current sinus infections 
(oral ingestion) resolved in eight days; Acute cuticle infections-
(topical)- twenty four hours. Another major area in which we have improved 
our clinical results is in the area of bowel detoxification and dysbiosis.
The <A HREF="msilva.htm">Colloidal Silver </A>has provided excellent 
removal of abnormal intestinal bacteria;  also it has proved to be a great 
adjunct to our Candida albicans, Epstein Barr Virus and Chronic Fatigue 
Syndrome protocols.</P>

In May of 1994 I started on Kidney Dialysis and had a real bad time of it.
My sponsor  introduced the Pycnogenols  <A HREF="mopc.htm">
PROANTHENOLS OPC-85 </A> to me and I spoke with my Doctor about it and he 
said I should not take it. I later saw a pharmicist discussing it on TV 
and I asked  him about it, and he said it would help.  I started taking it 
in January of 1995 and it put me "back in the saddle again"!</P>

PROANTHENOLS OPC-85 </A> the vice-like cramps he gets in his legs have been

My wife has fallen in love with the <A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS

motrin, etc.). This amazing nutrient has made a new woman of her, and I am 
feeling a lot better myself since taking it. My arthritic leg has been 
feeling much better with less and less pain killer needed to function.
I hope that I can share this wonderful product with others. I have been 
talking about our personal healthy results and have hung little flyers
all over town. I also obtained some materials from Life Plus for 
distribution.</P>

<P>
WONDER GEL is a fast acting, pain relieving, deep penetrating gel that is applied topically for the relief of aches and pains of stiff, swollen joints.  It is great for the relief of pain caused by overworked muscles and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis or bursitis. It combines the restorative properties of Aloe Vera, Colloidal Gold, Methyl Salicylate, plus two fantastic herbal concentrates of Jaborandi and Copaiba--two amazing rainforest botanicals used by Amazonian people for thousands of years to minimize muscle and joint pain and fight inflammation. People are usually amazed at how fast it works and how effective it is. Amazingly, it is also great for headaches, sinus discomfort and back pain as well. WONDER GEL is used for almost anything you can imagine. It can be used by all ages and virtually every medicine cabinet in every home should have a jar of this pleasant, non-greasy, non-staining topical pain relieving gel. An important part of the Life Plus RAINFORCE special line of effective products, WONDER GEL is an ideal product to demonstrate reliable and fast effectiveness of the RAINFORCE product line.<P>

<H2>HEALING THE BODY AND THE LAND</H2>

This ancient wisdom is now available through WONDER GEL and other unique Life Plus RAINFORCE products. They bring you the benefits of highly effective natural herbal and plant extracts, harvested ecologically to preserve the natural resources of the rainforest and its people. Financial contributions are made supporting improved economics and education of the indigenous people.  Specific formulas are blended with other synergistic natural ingredients using current "state of the art" Life Plus technology, which results in fantastic, reliable results.</P>

<H2>UNLOCKING THE SECRETS OF THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  In addition to supporting athletic performance and quick recovery, the herbal ingredients in CATAGESIC have been used successfully by the indigenous tribes against symptoms of arthritis and rheumatism for centuries, In addition to the plants used for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, the added benefits of other synergistic ingredients in WONDER GEL help provide the arthritis and bursitis sufferer with many beneficial effects.  Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforest, WONDER GEL, a leading Life Plus RAINFORCE product, provides ancient rainforest tribal secrets of topical pain relief, reduced inflammation and a general overall improvement in general health when applied as needed.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>

<H2>HOW TO USE WONDER GEL</H2>
<P>   The ways to use WONDER GEL are as varied as the thousands of people using it, Simply apply it to the areas in need as you desire.  When acute pain exists, usually applying it three or four times a day is best. Most people notice relief right away.

In addition to joint and muscle pain from conditions such as arthritis, don't forget to use it for other discomforts too like headaches, sinus discomfort, tiredness, etc. Avoid use around eyes, open wounds and mucous membranes.</P>

<BR>
<H2>POWER OF CAT'S CLAW</H2>
<P>   Cat's Claw, also referred to as "u&#241;a de gato", is the new North American leader in important medicinal plants and comes from the South American Peruvian Rainforest. Six oxindole alkaloids have been isolated in the inner bark of the plant and have been proven to provide a general boost to the immune system. Other alkaloids and phytochemicals (glycosides) present in Cat's Claw have been isolated and tested and are shown to provide pronounced natural anti-inflammatory benefits. As a true adaptogen with almost unlimited therapeutic applications, Cat's Claw has been called by experts as a "World Cluss Herb: a "Miracle Herb" and a "Sacred Herb of the Rainforest." Health care providers are now using it successfully with their arthritic patients for its anti-inflammatory and immune-stimulating properties.</P>
<P>    The alkaloid content of the Cat's Claw plant varies depending on quality. It ranges from 0.1% to 1.0% total alkaloids. Most Cat's Claw products contain as little as only 1 to 5 mg of alkaloids, which are actually bound to tannins. In Cats Claw bark, the alkaloids and tannins actually form a complex, which is not bioavailable without an acid to break it apart. The alkaloids contained in Life Plus CATAGESIC have been standardized, utilizing a proprietary process to not only contain 4% oxindole alkaloids but also break apart the alkaloid-tannin complex.  Very importantly, this makes the alkaloids 100% bioavailable.  Consequently, a full 8 mg of pure bioavailable oxindole alkaloids is contained in each CATAGESIC tablet. This is up to eight times more than other Cats Claw capsules sold today!</P>

<H2>SYNERGISTIC DYNAMIC RAINFOREST HERBS</H2>
<P> The principle rainforest herbs used for their synergistic effects  during  athletic  training  and  recovery  include Chuchuhuasi, Cat's Claw and Muira Puama because of their natural anti-arthritic, anti-rheumatic and anti-inflammatory properties.  Chuchuhuasi may well become the next highly important rainforest plant to follow Cat's Claw in the newest rainforest discoveries. A major pharmaceutical company is developing newly discovered phytochemicals found in Chuchuhuasi bark, which are highly anti-inflammatory. The indigenous name of this huge tree translates to "trembling bark", which describes the indigenous tribes century long use of the Chuchuhuasi for arthritis and rheumatism and which led modern day researchers to discover its properties.</P>
<P>   Suma is another powerful herb, which is by far the most well-researched. Studies dating back to 1968 reveal that Suma enhanced muscle building without producing the negative hormonal side effects steroids are noted for.  By 1976, Suma was labeled the "Russian Secret" when supplementation with Suma by the Russian Olympic team gave them the competitive edge in the 1976 Olympic games.</P>

<P>CATAGESIC contains a new proprietary standardized extract of Suma, which provides 5% Ecdysterones and Saponins. These are active ingredients found in Suma, which are thought to provide its benefits.</P>
<P>  Yerba Mate and Muira Puama are strong tonics and nervous system fortifiers; Maca and Yerba MatC are dynamic energy tonics used throughout the rainforest to increase stamina and endurance.  Sarsaparilla is used to support circulation, clear toxins and stimulate metabolism, while Iporuru nutritionally supports muscles and joints as well as provides natural analgesic. Cat's Claw and Sarsaparilla are both known for their oxygenating properties and Tayuya helps the body remove accumulating lactic acid in muscle tissue.  Tayuya also has well-known analgesic properties while Suma and Maca have a natural nutritional muscle building effect.</P>

<H2>UNLOCKING THE SECRETS OF THE RAINFOREST</H2> 
<P>In addition to supporting athletic performance and recovery, many of the plants in CATAGESIC have been used successfully by the indigenous tribes against symptoms of arthritis and rheumatism for centuries.   In addition to the plants being used for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, the added benefits of increased stamina and energy, plus overall muscle toning and growth, could provide the arthritis sufferer with many beneficial effects.  Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforest.  CATAGESIC, one of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, provides the ancient rainforest tribal secrets of improved energy, stamina, endurance and muscle growth as well as the secrets of the rainforest in the prevention of arthritis.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
</P>  All botanicals contained in CATAGESIC have been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Education and a new income source from harvesting sustainable natural resources, like the herbs contained in CATAGESIC and all Life  Plus  RAINFORCE  products,  helps  provide  an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to help the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H2>HOW TO USE CATAGESIC</H2>
<P>   Take one tablet twice a day between meals.  Drink plenty of water to assist the body's natural processes. During times of special need, two to three tablets, two to three times per day as needed.</P>

<H2> THE POWER OF CAT'S CLAW </H2>

<P>  Cat's Claw, also referred to as "u&#241;a de gato" and "Sacred Herb of the Rainforest," is the new leader in naturally occurring immune-supportive agents. All Cat's Claw utilized in Life Plus products is of the highest quality and is harvested in the Peruvian Rainforest in a sustainable ecological friendly manner.  Six oxindole alkaloids have been isolated from the inner bark of this wonderful plant and have been proven to provide a general boost to the immune system.  These oxindole alkaloids also have a profound effect on the ability of white blood cells to engulf and digest harmful microorganisms and foreign matter. This natural process is called phagocytosis.   Other alkaloids and phytochemicals present in Cat's Claw have been shown to provide natural support against many viri.  When included in the diet, they naturally support normal blood pressure and help prevent inflammation as well as act as anti-mutagenic agents.</P>
<P>  The Cat's Claw in CATIMUNE is the highest quality available worldwide and is standardized to an alkaloid content of 4% utilizing a new proprietary process. This provides a full 8 milligrams of pure oxindole alkaloids per tablet - over 2 to 8 times more than standard Cat's Claw capsules sold today! Why settle for standard Cat's Claw capsules when you can get more from CATIMUNE, plus the added benefits and actions of the other synergistic Rainforest botanicals in this powerful immune formula.  In addition to the standardized Cat's Claw extract, two more powerful standardized extracts are included, Pau d'Arco and Suma. These high quality standardized extracts guarantee the potency of the extracts and provide the highest amount of researched and documented beneficial phytochemicals available to provide an extremely potent and highly beneficial formula.</P>

<H2>FIVE-STEPS T0 BETTER IMMUNE FUNCTION </H2>
<P>The CATIMUNE formula is based on ancient and traditional methods employed by the indigenous tribes of the Rainforest. This, combined with the technology and science of today, guarantees potent standardized extracts. Using highly potent standardized extracts  like Cat's Claw containing 4% oxindole alkaloids and Suma containing 5% ecdysterones, plus saponins to increase our natural defense mechanisms is just the first, but an important step.</P>
<P>  The second step is to provide herbs and herbal extracts  with  natural  anti-viral,  anti-bacterial  and anti-parasitic actions that kill viri and bacteria directly. Cat's Claw and Pau d'Arco have been traditionally used for this purpose. Modern science has shown them to be highly effective, which validates their indigenous use. Pau d'Arco's anti-viral properties have been attributed to a set of phytochemicals called naphtoquinones and CATIMUNE provides a guaranteed potency of 3% of them in each tablet.  These important components in standardized extract form guarantees the potency and benefits of the herbal ingredients in CATIMUNE.</P>
<P>  The lymphatic system, much like a second circulatory system, is responsible for moving infection fighting killer cells from the blood stream into all other body cells There is no pump to control lymphatic fluid flow like the heart does in the blood circulatory system. Lymphatic flow depends on the contraction of muscles close to the walls of the lymphatic vessels when we move.  In other words, the lymphatic vessels are "massaged," which causes the lymphatic fluid (lymph) to flow. Carqueja and Sarsaparilla, two herbs indigenous to the rainforest, are included in CATIMUNE to support this important third step.</P>
<P>  The immune system's lymphocyte killer cells and the resulting debris from their work is contained in the bloodstream. The fourth step provided by several herbs in  CATIMUNE,   is  to   nutritionally   support  the circulatory system to help them find and attack invading bacteria.  Then, it is important to flush the resulting debris and toxins from the bloodstream. Carqueja is well-known in tribal medicine for its circulation and blood fortifying abilities. Sarsaparilla and Pau d'Arco have also been used for centuries as blood detoxifiers.</P>
<P>  The final step is to detoxify both the liver and kidneys to cleanse them completely. Chanca Piedra, also called "stone-breaker",  is world renown for its liver, kidney and gall bladder detoxifying benefits and is included in CATIMUNE for this benefit.</P>

<H2>HEALTH FROM THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforest. CATIMUNE, one of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, provides ancient Rainforest tribal secrets to improved immune function using an ancient 5-step formula and specific guaranteed potency botanicals, which have been used for centuries for their wealth of benefits in supporting immune function.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  All botanicals contained in CATIMUNE have been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and its people. Education and a new income source from harvesting sustainable natural resources, like the herbs contained in the Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>
<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H2>HOW TO USE CATIMUNE</H2>
 <P> Take one tablet twice daily on an empty stomach. Drink plenty of water to assist absorption. During times of special need or when exposed to bacterial or viral infections, take from two to three tablets, two or three times a day.</P>

<H2> THE POWER OF CAT'S CLAW </H2>

<p>   Cat's Claw, also referred to as "u&#241;a de gato" and "Sacred Herb of the Rainforest," is the new leader in naturally occurring anti-inflammatories and immune-supportive agents. All Cat's Claw utilized in Life Plus products is of the highest quality and is harvested in the Peruvian Rainforest in a sustainable ecological friendly manner. Six oxindole alkaloids have been isolated from the inner bark of this wonderful plant. These oxindole alkaloids have been proven to provide a general boost to the immune system as well as have a profound effect on the ability of white blood cells to engulf and digest harmful microorganisms and foreign matter. This natural process is called phagocytosis. Other alkaloids and phytochemicals present in Cat's Claw have been shown to provide natural support against many viri. When included in the diet, they naturally  insure  normal  blood  pressure  and  help  prevent inflammation, plus act as anti-mutagenic agents.</p>
 <p>   Life Plus CATS CLAW FORTE Drops contain the highest quality u&#241;a de gato available worldwide and is standardized. As a true daptogen with almost unlimited therapeutic applications, Cat's Claw has been called by experts as a "World Class Herb," a "Miracle Herb" and a "Sacred Herb of the Rainforest." Health care providers are now using it successfully with their patients in the prevention of many conditions such as arthritis, cancer, AIDS, Crohn's Disease, viral infections, respiratory infections, allergies, herpes, prostrate problems, lupus, Epstein Parr, rheumatism, chronic fatigue syndrome, PMS, diabetes and a variety of stomach and bowel disorders.</p>

<h2>MAXIMIZED BIOAVAILABLITY</h2>
 <p>  Dr. Klaus Keplinger's group in Austria are, by far, the most knowledgeable in the subject of Cat's Claw. They have researched Cat's Claw and its extraction methods for over fifteen years.  The following is quoted from an English translation from some of Keplinger's published information to Doctors and Pharmacists. Quoted from an English translation of "Radix Uncaria Tomentosae: Informative Literature by Klaus Keplinger" by the title of "Der Krallendorn Tee": 
<blockquote>"The active substances in the Cat's Claw Tea are alkaloids, which occur in the plant and its watery extract as a complex bound to tannins. In this form, only little of them can be activated. The complexes get split by the acidic milieu of the stomach; the alkaloids get transformed into their hydrochloride form and, in this way, get well absorbed."</blockquote></p>
<p>   It is well known that plants containing both alkaloids and tannins form complexes that Keplinger refers to which eliminate their bioavailability. Therefore, any health promoting benefits of these phytochemicals are not realized because they are not absorbed. Many herbalists will not combine different plants with active constituents of both alkaloidal and/or tannic forms in a herbal formula for this reason.</p>
<p>   Many Cat's Claw extracts are dark red to dark reddish-brown and consumers incorrectly believe that "the darker the color, the more concentrated the extract." This is not true! A darker Cat's Claw extract means more tannin is present and beneficial alkaloids are locked up with tannins, which have formed a non-bioavailable and poorly absorbed complex.</p>
<p>   When a concentrated liquid herbal extract is taken by mouth, the active ingredients are absorbed in the mouth, throat and upper stomach and very little reaches the lower stomach and the stomach acid.   Consumers believe that sublingual absorption of these extracts will expedite the active constituents to become absorbed more quickly into the bloodstream. However, with these other high tannin extracts this is not correct. The sublingual absorption of Cat's   Claw alkaloid-tannin complexes greatly reduces bioavailability and the benefits and desired results that the alkaloids can provide.</p>
<p>   CATS CLAW FORTE Drops are very different than all other liquid extracts. In addition to developing and utilizing a proprietary extraction method, it utilizes organic apple vinegar in place of water or alcohol. This natural acid releases the alkaloids from the tannins and very little tannin is extracted. This makes the extracted alkaloids 100% bioavailable, which can be evidenced in the light golden color of Life Plus CATS CLAW FORTE Drops. For this reason also, the assayed alkaloid content of CATS CLAW FORTE Drops is 4-6 times higher than other available water/glycerin or alcohol extracts, which for the most part aren't bioavailable, and provides 10 milligrams of pure bioavailable oxindole alkaloids per 30 drops. Using vinegar in the process not only releases the alkaloids from the tannins, it actually extracts more alkaloids.</p>

<h2>NEW PROCESS - SYNERGISTIC EFFECT</h2>
<p>  The immune system is equally involved in many other protective processes in the body.  These include its response to allergy producing substances, controlling the rate and aspects of aging, protection from free radicals and protection against degenerative diseases such as arthritis, cancer, arteriosclerosis and others. Probably the most well understood and studied is allergies and cancer.  Nutritionally supporting the immune system with natural substances like alkoxyglycerols has much more value than just helping the body fight off infections.</p>

<h2>HEALTH FROM THE RAINFOREST</h2>
<p>   Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforest tribes. CATS CLAW FORTE Drops, of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, reveals the ancient secrets to improved immune function, preventing inflammation and supporting energy.</p>

<h2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</h2>
 <p>  The herbal extracts in CATS CLAW FORTE Drops have been ecologically harvested using indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Only the alkaloid-rich inner bark is utilized.  The alkaloids and phytochemicals in the inner bark are almost identical to those found in the root of Cat's Claw and harvesting this way preserves the plant and provides for the future of the rainforest. Life Plus does not endorse harvesting Cat's Claw root and endangering our future supply of this important plant. Providing education and a new income source derived from harvesting sustainable natural resources, including plants found in Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying this valuable resource.</p>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<h2>HOW T0 USE CATS CLAW FORTE DROPS</h2>
<p>   Take one dropperful (30 drops) once or twice a day. During times of special need, dosages can be increased to two dropperfuls two to three times per day.   Each dropperful contains approximately 30 drops.  Each 2 ounce bottle of CATS CLAW FORTE Drops contains approximately 60 dropperfuls.  For maximum absorption and bioavailibility, do not dilute in water or juice.</p>

<H2> EXCLUSIVELY FOR WOMEN </H2>

<P>  From the dawn of our existence, man has continued on many quests--the quest for fire, magic potions and others. No quest has been so consistent throughout recorded history as our search for ways to stimulate sexual desire and to intensify sexual satisfaction.  TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops was developed exclusively for women and contains a synergistic blend of herbal extracts from the Amazon Rainforest. These plants have been used for centuries by the indigenous people of the rainforest.</P>
<P>   Stimulating female sexual desire is much more complex than stimulating male sex drive because a woman's focus and mental state plays a much larger role. The ability to relax, unwind and shut out the stress of the day in order to focus more fully on the sexual experience is just as important as increasing desire.  For this reason, several RAINFORCE botanicals are included in the TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops, which have a documented history of use in enhancing mental acuity and focus, reducing stress, increasing focus, and acting as a general tonic and relaxant to provide these types of benefits.</P>
 <P>  Hormonal imbalances, cycles and fluctuations can cause nervousness, stress, irritability, mood swings and even depression in many women. Balancing these many hormones is a key factor in supporting a woman's natural sexual drive. Botanicals well known for their hormonal balancing ability specifically for women play another key role in this formula so that women and their partners are not at the mercy of these cyclical patterns or  problems.  With these two important areas addressed, rainforest herbs used by the indigenous tribes to increase sexual desire, enhance skin sensations and act as sexual stimulants are contained in TOUCHFIRE HERS to provide synergistic and overall effectiveness.</P>

<H2>LONG HISTORY OF DYNAMIC EFFECTS </H2>
<P>Chuchuhuasi and Catuaba are the best known and most famous sexual stimulants of many tribes throughout the Peruvian Rainforest. Their sexual stimulating and tonic effects are legendary in this regard. Maca is cultivated high in the Andes Mountains in Peru where it has been utilized for centuries to increase sexual desire and fertility, increase stamina and endurance and promote mental clarity. Damiana with its ancient reputation as a sexual stimulant also acts as an antidepressant and tonic to both the central nervous and hormonal systems. Suma, called "Brazilian Ginseng" has been used for centuries to combat fatigue and balance female hormones in cases of frigidity and impotency. Sarsaparilla has a worldwide reputation and history dating back to the 1600's as a reliable, sexual stimulant. In addition, Abuta is known throughout Amazonia as a "midwives herb," employed specifically for women as a uterine tonic and relaxant as well as to increase sexual desire.</P>

<H2>HEALTH FROM THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  The rainforest plants in TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops contain vital phytochemicals and phytosterols, which nutritionally support the entire female sexual system, hormonal system, as well as the nervous system.  The indigenous people of the Amazon and rainforest regions have used these specific botanicals for centuries, not only as female tonics and sexual enhancers, but as tribal medicine to fight reduced fertility and hormonal imbalances, including menopause.  Some have even been used in marriage and fertility ceremonies for decades.  Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforests of the world. TOUCHFIRE HERS, one of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, provides the ancient rainforest tribal secrets supporting the health of women by helping to increase their sexual desire as well as helping to naturally and nutritionally balance hormone levels.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  All  botanicals  in  TOUCHFIRE  HERS  have  been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Education and a new income source derived from harvesting a sustainable natural resource like the herbs found in TOUCHFIRE HERS and all Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H2>HOW TO USE TOUCHFIRE HERS</H2>
<P>  TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops is furnished with a dropper. One dropperful contains approximately 30 drops. For best results, place 30 to 40 drops in two to three ounces of water or juice and take on an empty stomach.  Used as an occasional aid to increase female sexual desire, take 30 to 40 drops one or two hours before intimate activity.</P>
<P>  Most women take TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops on more of a routine basis. If you have special needs due to stress or lack of sex drive, take 30-40 drops twice a day for a minimum of 30 days for maximum benefit. Many women continue with this twice-a-day dosage on an ongoing basis.  However, you may try taking TOUCHFIRE HERS once a day after the initial month.   Each woman must adjust according to her needs. TOUCHFIRE HERS contains alcohol, which must be used for extracting and preserving the active phytochemicals found in the rainforest herbs contained in TOUCHFIRE HERS.  If you are sensitive to alcohol, place the recommended dosage in 2 to 3 ounces of hot or near-boiling water and let cool to lukewarm before taking; the alcohol will quickly evaporate.</P>

<H2> EXCLUSIVELY FOR MEN </H2>

<P>  TOUCHFIRE HIS Drops was developed exclusively for men and contains five powerful, high-potency herbal extracts from the Amazon Rainforest that have been used for centuries to increase male sexual desire as male tonics and to support male testosterone levels. The key ingredient of this dynamic new formula is a highly concentrated extract of an indigenous rainforest plant called Muira puama (also known as Potency Wood). Recent clinical research has shown an herbal extract of Muira puama to be highly effective in over 62% of 362 men studied in increasing libido and in successfully treating organic and psychogenic-related impotency. Compared to a clinically established effectiveness rate of only 34% for the only available prescription drug for impotency and lack of sexual desire, these are significant new findings.  The other natural  botanical  extracts  in  TOUCHFIRE  HIS  work synergistically with Muira puama to naturally calm nervous tension  and  stress,  nutritionally  support  male  hormone levels, act  as tonics to the prostrate and more importantly they increase sexual desire for men through increased bioavailable testosterone.</P>

<H2>AGING AND IMPOTENCY</H2>
<P>   Men are capable of retaining their sexual virility well past their 80's.  Although impotency is thought to affect over 25% of men over the age of 50, many times it is only temporary and can be reversed with the proper nutritional support. Today, an estimated 10 to 20 million men suffer from erectile dysfunction or some type of organic impotency, and organic causes of impotency account for approximately 90% of all cases in men over 50. This number is expected to increase dramatically as the median age of the population increases. In a 1986 clinical study, it was documented that actual testosterone production doesn't generally decrease as men age, but the amount of free circulating testosterone does diminish as more gets bound to the albumin and becomes unavailable for the body's use. These changes appear to begin by middle age and happen during a natural chemical process called ''sex-hormone-binding-globulin" or ''SHBG''. Other researchers believe that the increase in SHBG is a major contributing factor in prostate disorders, impotency and a decline in sex drive.  New European research reported in 1995 reveals that an extract of Nettle Root can interfere with this SHBG binding process by almost l0-fold.</P>

<H2>LONG HISTORY OF DYNAMIC EFFECTS</H2>
<P>  Muira puama has long been valued by the Peruvian and Brazilian Indians to increase sexual desire in men, and as a tonic for the nervous system. This has been documented in books written as early as 1930. This long history and substantial documentation has led current researchers like Dr. Waynberg to clinically evaluate it's effectiveness as a sexual stimulant and a possible treatment for impotency.   Catuaba, the  most famous of all Brazilian sexual enhancing plants, has been so highly regarded as a male libido enhancer and sexual stimulant that the Tupi Indians have praised it's wonders in many songs for generations.  Damiana has such an ancient reputation that it was even carried over to its botanical name, Turnera aphrodisiaca.  After centuries of use, renown herbalists like David Hoffman, now believe that its alkaloids could have a testosterone-like action.  Sarsaparilla has a worldwide reputation and history of use dating back to the 1600's as an aphrodisiac and male tonic. It contains at least 9 documented plant steroids, several of which are only found in Sarsaparilla. Nettle Root has been shown to increase free floating testosterone levels, and increased testosterone is a well documented natural libido enhancer.</P>

<H2>HEALTH FROM THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>   The rainforest plants in the TOUCHFIRE HIS Drops contain vital phytochemicals and phytosterols, which nutritionally support the entire male sexual hormonal system as well as the nervous system.  The indigenous people of the Amazon and rainforest regions have used these specific botanicals for centuries, not only as male tonics and sexual enhancers, but also as tribal medicine to fight reduced fertility and male hormonal imbalances, especially lowered testosterone levels. Some have even been used in marriage and fertility ceremonies for decades. Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforests of the world. TOUCHFIRE HIS, one of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, provides the ancient rainforest tribal secrets supporting the health of men by helping to increase their sexual desire as well as helping to naturally and nutritionally balance hormone levels.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>   All botanicals in TOUCHFIRE HIS have been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Education and a new income source derived from harvesting a sustainable natural resource like the herbs found in TOUCHFIRE HIS and all Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>
<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H2>HOW TO USE TOUCHFIRE HIS</H2>
<P>  TOUCHFIRE HIS Drops is furnished with a dropper. One dropperful contains approximately 30 drops. For best results, place 30 to 40 drops in two to three ounces of water or juice and take on an empty stomach.  Used as an occasional aid to increase male sexual desire, take 30 to 40 drops one or two hours before intimate activity.</P>
<P>  Most men take TOUCHFIRE HIS Drops on a more routine basis. If you have special needs due to stress or lack of sex drive, take 30-40 drops twice a day for a minimum of 30 days for maximum benefit.
   Many men continue with this twice-a-day dosage on an ongoing basis. However, you may try taking TOUCHFIRE HIS once a day after the initial month.  Each man must adjust according to his needs. TOUCHFIRE HIS contains alcohol, which must be used for extracting and preserving the active phytochemicals found in the rainforest herbs contained in TOUCHFIRE HIS.   If you are sensitive to alcohol, place the recommended dosage in 2 to 3 ounces of hot or near-boiling water and let cool to lukewarm before taking; the alcohol will quickly evaporate.</P>

<H2> EMERGING AWARENESS </H2>

<P>   As society develops new awareness of the importance of natural foods we understand why we should eat them. In the fast-paced lives we live, it is difficult to consume the recommended seven cups of fruits and vegetables every day. It is even difficult or impractical for many people to obtain them.</P>
 <P>  As our scientific community learns more about our foods, they are also learning what they contain. It is an almost everyday occurrence in national news about some researcher finding a new substance in broccoli, cauliflower, carrots or whatever. The news expounds these new "finds" are linked to cancer, birth defects, asthma, arthritis, etc. These substances have been in our foods all along but we are just beginning to learn about them.</P>
<P>    One thing is for sure, our bodies, and the trillions of cells that make it up, were designed to have them to metabolize properly, stay healthy and live a productive life. Without reasonable amounts of them, our cells and organs simply could not function properly.   When this happens, we see signs of deficiencies such as chronic infections, improper healing of wounds, lack of energy, unbalanced blood chemistry, nervousness and anxiety, lack of mental acuity and all kinds of degenerative diseases.</P>

<H2>"PHYTO"</H2>
<P>   Our digestive system is efficient in digesting and absorbing nutrients from fruits and vegetables.  It is now understood that we obtain the basic three food groups from vegetables, that is fats, proteins and carbohydrates.  We need them for tissue repair, growth and development and the production of hormones, enzymes and other substances. We also get energy in the form of calories from them.</P>
<P>   A whole new area has come into view the last few years--what the scientific community calls "phytochemicals." In the nutrition industry, we call them "phytonutrients." Actually, both terms are correct. They are chemicals and also nutrients. "Phyto" is the term used in botany, herbal science and in the scientific and natural health communities to label any substance coming from a plant. The term actually comes from the Greek word phyton, meaning "a plant."  So then, phytonutrients are nutritional substances that come from plants.</P>

<H2>SPECIFIC PHYTONUTRIENTS</H2>
<P>   Numerous phytonutrients have been identified and isolated. Yet common sense tells us that there are many more. A partial listing of some of them includes allyl sulfides in garlic, onions, leeks, chives and shallots; capsaicin in chili peppers; genistein in soy beans; polyphenol catechins in green and black teas; camosol in rosemary; lignans in flaxseed; glycerrhizin in licorice root; limonenes in citrus fruits; sulforaphane in broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, turnips and kale; lycopene in tomatoes, red grapefruit, watermelon and apricots; alpha-carotene in carrots and seaweed; beta-carotene in carrots, squash, apricots, peaches, red, yellow and dark green vegetables; lutein/zeaxanthin in yellow squash, spinach, collards, mustard and turnip greens; polyphenols (bioflavonoids) in red grapes and wine, artichokes, strawberries and blueberries, anthocanins in cranberries and currents; gingerol in gingeroot; phytic acid in rye, wheat, rice, lima beans, sesame seeds, peanuts and soybeans; phenethyl isothiocyanates 
in horseradish, mustard, cabbage and turnips; saponins in kidney beans, chickpeas and lentils; onoterpenes in basil, carrots, parsley, mint, cabbage, citrus and caraway seeds; indoles in brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale and dark green leafy vegetables.</P>

<H2>SUPER GREEN ALGAE</H2>
<P>   These "super foods" are simply power houses of phytonutrients and high quality, easily utilized nutrients.  They are cultured in controlled environments to insure they are free of chemicals and are one of the most highly concentrated sources of nutrition available. RICH 'N GREEN contains three of the most important ones, Chlorella, Spirulina and Hydra Green.  They have special value because of their large amount of chlorophyll, which is a great detoxifier in the body.  They are high in RNA (ribonucleic acids), which are used in the body to produce DNA. These super algae are also rich in carotenes and lypoic acid.</P>

<H2>MAITAKE & REISHI MUSHROOMS</H2>
<P>   A number of mushrooms have been used by eastern civilizations for centuries. Maitake and Reishi are two of the most valuable because of their ability in supporting the immune system. They are also known as good protectors of the liver.</P>

<H2>BARLEY & WHEAT GRASS</H2>
<P>   Grains such as barley and wheat all produce a grass. When it is in the early "sprout" stage it is loaded with incredible amounts of nutritional  value.   They are particularly rich in  plant enzymes, beta-carotene, Vitamins A, C and K, chlorophyll, RNA, DNA, antioxidants and amino acids.   They are simply a gold mine of phytonutrients fitting for a healthy diet.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  The food concentrates from the Amazon Rainforests in RICH 'N GREEN tablets have been ecologically harvested using indigenous tribes to help protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Providing education and a new income source derived from harvesting sustainable natural resources like the phytonutrients in RICH 'N GREEN tablets and other Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying this valuable resource.</P>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>


<H2>HOW TO USE RICH 'N GREEN</H2>
<P>   There is no iron-clad method how to take RICH 'N GREEN tablets. Two RICH 'N GREEN tablets supply the equivalent amount of vitamins, minerals, plant enzymes and other phytonutrients as one full cup of fresh vegetables.  The U. S. Government recommends seven one-cup servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Adjust to your needs.  If it is difficult for you to obtain and prepare your daily vegetables, these tablets are very convenient.   The foods in RICH 'N GREEN tablets have not been cooked and are in the most valuable "raw" state. So, you also obtain the greatest benefit from their phytonutrients.</P>

deficiency. Nowhere is there a more powerful or effective means of obtaining
them than by taking Life Plus BERRY'D TREASURE.</P>

have been concentrated by a proprietary process, using only cool, 
contaminant-free water to maintain high bioavailability and colloidal
nature.</p>

<H2> EXOTIC BLEND </H2>

<P>   JUNGLE ADE is an exotic blend of tropical fruits that grow in the pristine Amazon Rainforest -- rich in vitamins, minerals and all kinds of phytonutrients that can be found nowhere on earth other than in this diverse incredible ecosystem.  These exotic fruits, Camu-Camu, Passion Fruit, Guava, Cashew Fruit and Cupuacu are full of important nutrients as nature intended and contain many synergistic phytonutrients never before seen.</P>

<H2>TOTALLY ORGANIC</H2>
<P>   As North American agricultural methods, which utilize synthetic fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, continue to destroy the balance of our soils and disturb the natural balance of nature, the fruits and vegetables growing in the totally natural environment of the Amazon basin in South America become more and more important. The fruits used in the JUNGLE ADE formula are 100% totally organic and free of chemical contaminants.</P>

<H2>NEVER BEFORE</H2>
<P>   RAINFORCE JUNGLE ADE includes several new and delicious fruits, never before offered in North America or Europe, which have been harvested in the Amazon Jungle by indigenous tribes and local communities. These exotic fruits have been juiced and then dried by a new and proprietary process, which preserves their valuable phytonutrients, preserving everything that nature intended in a convenient dry granular form that is easily mixed with water in your home to make a delicious and nutritious beverage.</P>

<H2>CAMU-CAMU</H2>
<P>   One of the rainforest's newest discoveries is a delicious fruit by the name Camu-Camu. It is included in Life Plus JUNGLE ADE for its high nutritive value and pleasant taste. This small lemon-sized fruit is presently the highest known source of natural Vitamin C on the planet and grows wild in the Amazon Rainforest. Camu-Camu, also known as Rumberry·, provides 3,000% of the Vitamin C, 300% of the Niacin, 200% of the Riboflavin and 150% of the Phosphorous than oranges.</P>

<H2>CASHEW FRUIT</H2>
<P>   In addition to Camu-Camu, JUNGLE ADE contains Cashew Fruit, also known as Cajueiro, Cupuacu, Maracuja and Guava fruits. Unlike the well known cashew nuts that are so popular all over the world, Cajueiro is a highly nutritious fruit.  It is very peculiar and really isn't a fruit at all.  It is actually a swollen peduncle that grows behind the real fruit, which is the cashew nut. This large pulpy and juicy part of the plant is actually referred to as a pseudo-fruit with a fine sweet flavor and aroma. The cashew nut grows externally on one end of it in its own kidney shaped hard shell.  Interesting Amazonian folklore include the cashew juice as an aid for flu and colds, a sexual stimulant, and other things.  Cashew fruit contains five times the amount of Vitamin C as oranges, too.</P>

<H2>CUPUACU</H2>
<P>   The Cupuacu fruit is in the chocolate family and looks much like the fruit of the chocolate tree. The Life Plus RAINFORCE makes Cupuacu fruit available for the first time in North America and Europe. Rich in phytonutrients with a delicious exotic taste, Cupuacu has been a primary food source in the rainforest, both for the indigenous people and animals alike. It is about the size of a cantaloupe and is highly prized for its creamy, exotic tasting pulp throughout the Amazon basin. it is used throughout Peru and Brazil to make fresh juice, ice cream, jam and tarts.</P>

<H2>PASSION FRUIT</H2>
<P>   An important constituent of JUNGLE ADE is Passion Fruit. A certain species known as Maracuja, is the type that grows in the Amazon Rainforest and is the one included in JUNGLE ADE. Maracuja juice has been used a wonderful source of power packed phytonutrients as well as a good tasting fruit.</P>

<H2>GUAVA</H2>
<P>   Guava, also known as Goiaba, is enjoyed as a sweet treat by indigenous people throughout the rainforest. It has traditionally been recommended as a natural fruit for diabetics and for those needing to maintain consistent blood sugar levels. It tastes great and contains a high concentration of health-supporting plant enzymes.</P>

<H2>HELPING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
 <P>  All of the natural fruits contained in JUNGLE ADE have been ecologically harvested using indigenous tribes to help protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Providing education and a new income source derived from harvesting a sustainable natural resource like all five of the delicious fruits found in JUNGLE ADE and herbs in other Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforest resource. For instance, world renown ethnobotanist, Mark Plotkin states that " a forest stand of Camu-Camu is worth twice the amount to be gained from cutting down the forest and replacing it with cattle." He believes the rational nurturing and harvesting of medicinal herbs and the nutritious fruits contained in JUNGLE ADE holds real economic promise for local Amazon communities. The Life Plus RAINFORCE is proud to be the first to make this important new resource available to North America and Europe and is dedicated to be the leader in helping to create an economical alternative to destroying the rainforest.</P>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>


<H2>HOW TO USE JUNGLE ADE</H2>
  <P>  Stir, shake or blend one or more teaspoonfuls of JUNGLE ADE concentrate, according to taste, per each eight ounce glass of clear, contaminant-free  drinking  water  to  make  a  super-tasting, phytonutrient-rich, health beverage. It can be mixed one glass at a time or by the quart or half gallon.  Store in refrigerator after mixing. JUNGLE ADE can be used just as a nutritious, enjoyable beverage or can be used to swallow supplement tablets for the synergistic phytonutrients it contains.  JUNGLE ADE is great to use in mixing with powdered protein drinks like <A HREF="http://vitality.simplenet.com/mpromax.htm">PROMAX</A> and for preparing <A HREF="http://vitality.simplenet.com/mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A>. For milk lovers, a fruit creme can be easily made by mixing JUNGLE ADE about 50/50 with milk.   Think of JUNGLE ADE as a replacement for carbonated soft drinks and sugary childrens' drinks as well.</P>

<H2> UNIQUE TREASURE </H2>

<p>  JATOBA TEA is definitely one of the most unique treasures of both of the Brazilian and Peruvian Rainforest. JATOBA TEA is well known to the people of the Amazon and has been used there for centuries as a staple herbal component of many of the indigenous people. It has been used extensively for hundreds of years by the lumberjacks in the Brazil forests as an energizer to help them feel strong and vigorous.  They can be seen day after day, heading off to work, carrying their "jug" of JATOBA TEA. They work hard and need lots of energy to keep going in the hot and humid climate of the rainforest.</p>

<h2>GOOD TASTING</h2>
<p>  JATOBA TEA is truly good tasting and can be used as an herbal beverage by the whole family, or it can be used at special times for special purposes as part of an overall health-supporting program.  It can be drank alone, just by adding hot water, or honey can be added if desired. Some individuals in South America believe the benefits of JATOBA TEA are enhanced when honey is added. However, it is always of value to add a little lemon juice to the tea. The acidity from the lemon juice helps to free the active alkaloid substances from the tannins so that they are much more easily absorbed into the body to provide their benefits. It is not necessary to add so much lemon that the tea becomes too tart, only a little is adequate.</p>

<h2>OTHER INDIGENOUS USES</h2>
 <p>  Besides being used for weakness, energy and stamina, JATOBA TEA has been used as a tonic for the respiratory and urinary systems by the indigenous people of the Amazon Basin for centuries. Like Pau d' Arco, Jatoboa is known for its ability to fight fungus and yeast-like candida albicans. Jatoba is also included in Life Plus <A HREF="http://vitality.simplenet.com/mprost.htm">PROSTATE FORMULA</A>. This great tasting tea is packaged in 30 convenient, easy-to-use tea bags per box. Just drink it hot or cold as you would any tea.</p>

<h2>SYNERGISTIC WITH OTHER PRODUCTS</h2> 
<p>JATOBA TEA is extremely beneficial by itself or is also very useful as an addition to the diet as a synergistic beverage for those needing more energy, experiencing discomfort of the respiratory or urinary systems and in support of all weight loss programs.  It is especially synergistic when taken together with Life Plus <A HREF="http://vitality.simplenet.com/mprost.htm"> PROSTATE FORMULA</A>. Also it can be a very worthwhile addition to those taking Life Plus <A HREF="http://vitality.simplenet.com/mlung.htm">LUNG FORMULA</A> for its synergistic effects. Some people notice an increase in frequency of urination and include it along with <A HREF="http://vitality.simplenet.com/mdiuplx.htm">DIUPLEX</A> when desired.</p>

<h2>UNLOCKING THE SECRETS OF THE RAINFOREST</h2> 
<p>In addition to the bark of the Jatoba tree being used for energy and stamina, it has been used for numerous other health benefits for centuries.   Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the Amazon Rainforests. Life Plus and Life Plus Members are committed to doing everything within their power to ensure the preservation of our life-giving rainforests.</p>

<h2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</h2>
<p>   Life Plus JATOBA TEA is a natural botanical product. It is made from the bark of the Jatoba tree known scientifically as Hymenaea courbaril. The bark is ecologically harvested using indigenous tribes to help protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Providing education and a new income source derived from harvesting a sustainable natural resource like Jatoba found in Life Plus JATOBA TEA and other Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying this valuable resource.</p>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<h2>HOW TO USE JATOBA TEA</h2>
<p>  Steep one JATOBA TEA bag in one full cup (8 oz) of boiling water for at least five minutes.  The longer it steeps, the more nutrients the tea will contain. Add some lemonjuice to aid the bioavailability of important phytonutrients. Add honey to taste if desired. Drink as a delicious hot or iced beverage, two or more times per day or as desired for energy, to support the urinary or respiratory systems, or for its natural anti-fungal action. JATOBA TEA can be made up by the quart or half-gallon and stored in the refrigerator if desired.  The inclusion of a small amount of lemon juice is best because the natural acidity in the lemon juice helps to free the active alkaloids in the tea from the tannins contained in it. Tnis causes the alkaloids to be more easily assimilated by the body and therefore more utilized as well. Do not add more lemon juice than what is necessary as the taste can become too tart--a little is all you need.</p>

<IMG SRC="logo3.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ><H1>Business Opportunity</H1> 
<B><P>You can now make money in a home business opportunity from Life Plus just by referring all natural nutritional supplements that can improve both your health and your pocketbook.</P>
<H2>Choose Your Advantage!</H2> 
<P><I>The most important thing is our health...</I> 
<BR><BR> 
<HR>
 Visit our <A HREF="index.html">home page</A> for more exciting and healthful products!</P> 

<P><P>




<P>Life Plus is an excellent home business opportunity. In order to receive bonus checks from Life Plus, all you do is make referrals and purchase a minimum of $40 of Life Plus products or literature each 
month. That's it!</P>
<P>There is <B>no required inventory to buy, no product to ship, and no money to collect.</B> It can all 
be done with toll free numbers, credit cards and friendly service. It's called networking. Before you know 
it, the referrals begin building!</P>
<P>
Now Life Plus has made it even easier and more financially rewarding for you to refer these wonderful products to others! It's called the Monthly Automatic Qualifying (MAQ) Dividend Program. Here's how it works:</P>
<P>
The MAQ (pronounced mack) Program is designed to make certain that you don't miss your bonus check because you forgot to place your $40 minimum qualifying order that month and that you don't run out of the products that you take on a regular basis! There are two plans to choose from: Plan A or Plan B. <B>Plan A</B> will automatically ship you the products you select each month. <B>Plan B</B> is a backup plan that says Life Plus will ship you your pre-determined product <I>only if</I> you have not qualified by placing your $40 minimum order by midnight the 25th of each month. <P>
<P>
Now here's the really exciting part! Life Plus will pay you an <I>additional 20%</I> on the initial purchase of your referrals! This means if you sign up as a MAQ member, <B>you will receive 25% </B>of the initial purchase of every single person you sponsor up to a $200 bonus per referral! This is an incredible deal! You get the benefits of being healthy, helping those you know to be healthy <I>and </I>make money doing it!</P>
<P>
It's easy to become a MAQ member. Just call Life Plus at <B>1-800-572-8446 toll-free</B> within the US or Canada or call the US and 1-501-698-2311 and ask for a <B>MAQ application form</B>. Our international distributors can request an application form from us via e-mail and we will mail you one so that you can save the cost of the long-distance phone call!</P> 
<P>
Become a MAQ member today and see your income soar!</P>
<P>
Tell a few friends about Life Plus. Then have fun and enjoy the healthier and more successful lifestyle that your new Life Plus business can provide for you!! Because your friends will tell their friends who will tell their friends and so on and so on......</P>
<P>
Good luck with your new business and remember that we are always here to help you be successful, because frankly, if you're successful, we're successful!

<b><CENTER>How simple referrals can make even your wildest dreams come true</b>
</font><br>

</center>

<p>
Have you ever gone to a movie or a restaurant and told others how great it was? That is called a "referral." Have you ever referred anyone to a product, a store, or a company you like? Sure you have.

<p>
	Life Plus expanded this simple referral concept by creating an income opportunity for you. As a Life Plus member, you can make referrals from your home by phone and mail.

<p>
	You don't have to stock products. You don't pay fees to register or to receive royalty checks each month.

<p>
	You purchase great products at true wholesale for your own use direct from the manufacturer.

<p>
	When you refer new members to Life Plus yourself, they become first level to you and start new legs. Members that they refer become second level to you. This can continue through an infinite number of levels.

<p>
	You earn a five percent Royalty on the purchases of those members in your first two levels and ten percent on levels three, four, five and six. In addition, you can earn up to a six percent Infinity Bonus on the purchases of those members in your additional levels.
<P>
<H2>If you refer just one person each month, who in turn refers just one person each month, your downline will grow like this:</H2><P>

</TR>
</TABLE>


<p>
	Call Life Plus and introduce your referral to one of our friendly representatives. They will register them and process their order immediately.

<p>
	Then, each month when you purchase at least a minimum of only $40 worth of qualifying products for your own use, you will receive your Royalties.

<p>
	Our system incorporates the principle of the multiplication of efforts of others. The first U.S. billionaire, J. Paul Getty said, "I'd rather have 1% of the efforts of others than 100% of what I can do."

<p>
	In fact, if you refer two people each month and help them do the same for nine months, you could have more income than earning monthly interest on a millionaire's nestegg in the bank.

<p>
	Your efforts combined with the resources at Life Plus can create income beyond your dreams.

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your financial
representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048) or 
<A HREF="prospectus.html"><B>request a prospectus now.</B></A> 
Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send
money. Remember that there is no assurance that the objective of any
mutual fund will be achieved, and mutual fund returns and net asset
values fluctuate. Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which
may be more or less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to
maintain a net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no
assurance that they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or
guaranteed by the U.S. government.

Where is my money? Why is it there? How is it doing? These are the
questions that every investor needs to ask. But it's a broader curiosity
that leads an individual investor to want to know more about what
happens when investment dollars are put to work.
<P>

There are few subjects that are as engrossing as investing can be. For
those who like to measure change and plot performance progress, the
investment world offers plenty of analytical tools. Yet others develop
an interest in investing as a means to an end. These curious investors
apply what they know about investing as they pursue lifetime goals:
financing a child's education, acquiring a vacation home or providing
for a carefree retirement. 
<P>

Whatever the source of your curiosity, we hope to pique it in Snapshots,
quick glimpses of the state of the U.S. economy and financial markets,
and The Longer View, a series of articles on general investing topics.

Kemper Funds believes that working with financial representatives is an
investor's best approach for achieving his or her goals in today's
complex and global investment markets. Kemper Funds are offered by
many financial representatives, including broker/dealers, financial
planners, insurance agents and bank investment counselors. 
<P>

This part of Kemper.com is restricted because communications created for
registered financial representatives do not include the same disclosures
required of
communications for the general public or fund shareholders. A registered
representative is someone who has completed extensive coursework in investment
company products. Much of the information presented in this area is
available, with additional disclosure, elsewhere on the site. Other material was
created for Kemper Funds' sales force and not relevant to the general
public.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048), 
<A HREF="prospectus_email.html">
e-mail us your request</A> for a prospectus through the mail or 
<A HREF="prospectus_download.html">

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

Any overviews herein are intended to be general in nature and for current
interest. While helpful, these overviews are no substitute for
professional tax, financial or legal advice. Investors should seek
such professional advice for their particular situation. Neither
Kemper Distributors, Inc. nor any of its affiliates or representatives
is providing tax, financial or legal advice.

Kemper Funds originated in Chicago in 1948, when five entrepreneurs formed a mutual fund to capitalize on a technological breakthrough called television. Much - the company's name, ownership and scope of its funds' investments - has changed since then. While Kemper headquarters today remain in Chicago, the company's reach extends far and wide. We share our success with the many friends, neighbors and partners we invite you to meet on the following pages.

<FONT SIZE=-1><I>A new WETA series<BR>underwritten by Kemper Funds management</I>
</FONT>

<P>



According to the <A HREF="http://www.ncoa.org">National Council on Aging</A>, someone will turn 50 every 7.5 seconds from now until 2014. But what does it mean to be a mid-lifer? What are the options? The possibilities? The realities? Mid-life is a time of dramatic change. Today's mid-life generation is uniquely positioned to experience this time as no generation has before -- they are healthier than their parents were; they have more choices; and they will live longer.

<P>

<I>In the Prime</I> explores being in the prime of life today. Part of a multimedia project from WETA, Washington, D.C., <I>In the Prime</I> is a 26-part, weekly, half-hour television series that can be seen on public television stations nationwide (<A HREF="intheprime_times.html">check local listings</A>). Hosted by veteran journalist Deborah Potter, <I>In the Prime</I> presents personal profiles, commentaries, and studio discussions with experts to address issues such as love, career, family, money, retirement, responsibility, mortality, and the many approaches to a physically and spiritually healthy life.

<P>

The very idea of mid-life is an evolving one. Since 1900, the average life expectancy has grown more than it had in the previous 2,000 years, according to Dr. Robert Butler of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. Not so very long ago, people could well expect to die by the age of 50. Today retirement age is creeping upward. Now instead of retiring at 65, some people are continuing to work; others have set a much earlier retirement goal and leave the work world at 50 or 55 to pursue a dream -- from sailing around the world to returning to school, to moving to a rural setting from a city.

<P>

"Today the mentality of being 50 is more like being 40 was years ago," says Phylis Geller, executive producer of the series, and senior vice president of cultural programming and new media for WETA, Washington, D.C. "It's a whole new environment with so many exciting options. <I>In the Prime</I> is a sort of road map that will present all of the avenues for today's mid-lifers."

<P>

<I>In the Prime</I> introduces viewers to some of the people who have chosen to see the second half of their lives in terms of freedom and opportunity, rather than resignation and regret. Together with guests as varied as comedian Tom Smothers, Sydney Biddle Barrows (the "Mayflower Madam"), poet Judith Viorst, financial adviser John McIntyre, The New Yorker writer Brendan Gill, restaurateur Nora Pouillon, feminist author Letty Cottin Pogrebin, spiritual philosopher Deepak Chopra, and many others, Potter reviews the life choices associated with being over 45.

<P>

"What people are pursuing at mid-life is different from what they pursued in their youth. They often begin to look inward and sense that it's time to shift their focus to more fundamental things," says senior producer Phil O'Connor.

<P>

The series reviews how people assess themselves as they approach mid-life; how they evaluate where they are in terms of their early expectations and how they see their future; how they approach romantic relationships, both old and new; and how they look at nonretirement, divorce, creativity, and work. <I>In the Prime</I> looks at the possibilities for mid-lifers in the current climate of corporate America, at the capacity to learn after a certain age, and at facing serious illness and the alternative treatments to traditional Western medicine, and explores what it means to be a true adult.

<P>

Host Deborah Potter has more than 20 years of experience in broadcast journalism. She served as the Washington correspondent for CNN from 1991 to 1994, and was with CBS News for 13 years as White House, State Department, and congressional correspondent.

<P>

The television series is part of a multimedia project that includes print, online, and video components. <I>In the Prime</I> is a production of WETA, Washington, D.C., with funding provided by Kemper Funds. Executive producer is Phylis Geller; Phil O'Connor is senior producer. Associate producers are Anna Chen and Janice Holland.

<P>

<A HREF="http://www.weta.org/itp/"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../gifs/friendslist_weta_logo.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
WETA</A>, Washington, D.C., is the third largest producer of programs for public television, including the award-winning series The Civil War, Baseball, In Performance at the White House, and The Kennedy Center Presents. Other cultural programming series debuting this fall include The West and National Geographic's Inside the White House. Sharon Percy Rockefeller is president and CEO of WETA.

<IMG SRC="gifs/aboutzki_head.gif" ALT="About Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.">
<BR>
Kemper Funds originated in 1948, when five entrepreneurs formed a mutual fund to capitalize on a technological
breakthrough called television.  They started Television Shares Management Corporation, and introduced their first
mutual fund, the Television Fund - which focused on the success and technological advances related to the television
industry.  Over the years, that fund evolved to what is now known as <A HREF="../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology
Fund.</A> 
<P>

In 1963, Television Shares Management Corporation was repositioned for broader appeal, taking on the new corporate
name Supervised Investors Services, Inc. ("SIS").  Through the 1960s, the company introduced three more mutual funds
-- Balanced Income Fund (now known as <A HREF="../funds/totalreturn.html">Kemper Total Return Fund</A>) which invested in both
stocks and bonds, Supervised Investors Growth Fund (now <A HREF="../funds/growth.html">Kemper Growth Fund</A>) and Summit Fund
(now <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A>).  
<P>

In 1970, Kemper Corporation acquired all the outstanding stock of SIS, and successfully combined the predominantly
fixed-income expertise of Kemper with the solid equity management of SIS.  Through the 1970s, the company diversified
its product line, adding <A HREF="../funds/preservation.html">Kemper Income and Capital Preservation Fund</A>, an
investment-grade bond fund, and <A HREF="../funds/money_market.html">Kemper Money Market Fund</A>, one of the nation's first
money market funds.  
<P>


SIS became Kemper Financial Services, Inc. in 1976.  That same year, Kemper pioneered a fully managed tax-exempt
income fund, <A HREF="../funds/muni_bond.html">Kemper Municipal Bond Fund</A> -- the nation's first municipal bond fund. 
Kemper was also one of the first in the industry to offer government securities portfolios.  More recently, Kemper
introduced its <A HREF="../funds/retire_series.html">Retirement Fund Series</A>, which combines zero-coupon bonds and equity
securities, and <A HREF="../funds/valuegrowth.html">Kemper Value+Growth Fund</A>, which combines both value and growth stocks
in the same portfolio using the expertise of two separate and distinct investment managers.  
<P>


In January 1996, Kemper Financial Services became part of the Zurich family and, in March 1996,  took the name Zurich
Kemper Investments, Inc. ("ZKI").  As investment manager of the Kemper Funds, ZKI is one of the nation's largest asset
managers.  The Kemper Funds family is comprised of more than 70 portfolios including growth- and value-style equity
funds, international funds, U.S. government and corporate bond funds, municipal bond funds, money market funds and
closed-end funds.  Together, this adds up to over $45 billion in assets and more than 3 million shareholder accounts.
<P>

You may <A HREF="../prospectus.html">download a Kemper Funds prospectus now</A>, request one from your financial
representative or call Kemper Shareholder Services at 1-800-621-1048.  The prospectuses contain more complete
information including management fees and expenses.  Please read them carefully before you invest or send money.

<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper_head.gif" ALT="Introducing Kemper Funds">
<BR>

Kemper Funds strive to provide high-quality asset management based on teamwork,
a clearly defined investment style and thorough research.  Below, you'll find
some general information about the types of funds managed by <A
HREF="aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.</A> and our investment
philosophy.  
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper1_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Money Funds">
<BR>

Kemper Money Funds feature a conservative approach to money management,
emphasizing stability of principal, competitive long-term returns and easy
liquidity.  And Kemper Money Funds can be used for a variety of purposes -- an
emergency fund, rainy day savings, short-term investment goals, or a temporary
"parking place" for your money while you decide where to invest.  With more than
$5 billion in assets under management and a track record spanning more than 20
years, Kemper Money Funds offer investors the confidence that comes with
experience.  
<P>

<A HREF="../funds/mmfunds.html">Kemper Money Funds</A> offer a choice of three
portfolios:
<P>
<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="../funds/money_market.html">Kemper Money Market Fund</A> invests primarily
in short-term, high-quality obligations of major banks and corporations.
<P>

<LI> <A HREF="../funds/govt_sec_port.html">Kemper Government Money Fund</A> adds an extra
degree of safety by investing only in U.S. Treasury securities and other
obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies and
related repurchase agreements.
<P>

<LI> <A HREF="../funds/tax_exempt.html">Kemper Tax-Free Money Fund</A> offers current
income that is exempt from federal income taxes* by investing in short-term,
high-quality municipal securities. 
<P>
</UL>

A Kemper Money Funds investment also offers a variety of access features,
including checkwriting and the MoneyPLUS cash management feature.  Consult the
<A HREF="../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> for details, including fees for the
MoneyPLUS feature, or call Kemper Shareholder Services at 1-800-621-1048. 
<P>
 
<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper2_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Income Funds">
<BR>

We believe few fund companies can match Kemper's time-tested experience,
research capabilities and presence in today's sophisticated bond market.  Kemper
has spent over 20 years managing income mutual funds.  That's longer than 94% of
all mutual fund companies. **
<P>

In the high yield arena alone, Kemper manages over $3.5 billion.  And with over
$8 billion in U.S. government funds assets, Kemper is a prominent presence in
the government securities marketplace. 
<P>

In managing the <A HREF="../funds/income.html">Income Funds</A>, we emphasize credit and
sector analysis, seeking to balance a competitive current yield with
opportunities for total return.  Subject to the particular policies of a
portfolio, our management team employs flexibility to shift among corporate,
treasury and mortgage-backed securities as opportunities and market conditions
warrant and as applicable portfolio policies and restrictions permit. 
<P>




<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper3_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Tax-Free Income Funds">
<BR>

Recognizing the need for investments that offer tax-free income*, Kemper created
America's first tax-free mutual fund, <A HREF="../funds/muni_bond.html">Kemper Municipal
Bond Fund</A>, back in 1976.  Today, Kemper manages over $5.0 billion of
tax-free mutual fund assets.    
<P>

In managing its tax-free investments, Kemper emphasizes quality.  Each of the
portfolios holds at least 90% of assets in investment-grade bonds. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper4_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Capital Growth Funds">
<BR>
Of the more than 500 companies that offer mutual funds, more than 80% don't have
a single equity fund that's over 25 years old, according to Lipper Analytical
Services, Inc. (as of 12/31/95).  Kemper has three -- and each has provided
investors with outstanding long-term performance.  Kemper <A
HREF="../funds/capgrowth.html">Capital Growth Funds</A> also offer style diversification,
from two separate and distinctly specialized investment managers: growth-style
management from Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc., and value-style management from
Dreman Value Advisors, Inc.***  Of course, there is no guarantee that a
particular management style will be successful. 
<P>

On the growth side, Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. emphasizes "growth at the
right price."  Using a disciplined team approach, Kemper analysts use
fundamental research to identify quality growth companies whose stocks are
selling at reasonable prices and whose earnings are growing faster than the
market average.  Characteristics of these companies include strong management,
industry leadership, a high return on equity, a low dividend/high reinvestment
rate and recession resistance.  Stocks must pass an intensive screening process
based on relative price/earnings ratios, relative profitability, present values
and momentum characteristics.
<P>

In evaluating value stocks, Dreman Value Advisors, Inc. focuses on companies
that are out of favor with investors because the market underestimates their
value or overlooks their potential.  Stocks become undervalued as a result of
overreaction by investors to unfavorable news about a company, industry or the
stock market in general.  Or, they can become undervalued as a result of a
market decline, poor economic conditions, tax-loss selling or actual or
anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the company.  Because the company
is out of favor, its stock trades at a price/earning ratio (P/E) that is lower
than its potential might suggest.  P/Es of value stocks are generally lower than
the overall market and lower than growth stock P/Es. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper5_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Horizon Fund">
<BR>

Few investors have 100 percent of their funds in stocks or 100 percent in the
bond market.  Deciding how much to invest in each -- an ongoing process called
asset allocation -- could be the most important investment decision you'll make. 
An important consideration is how soon will you need your invested dollars.  A
financial representative can help you answer that question, as well as other
considerations such as your specific investment objectives and risk tolerance. 
When you have, Kemper Horizon Fund can help by providing three diversified
portfolios of equity and fixed income securities designed for investors with
different investment horizons.
<P>

<A HREF="../funds/horiz20.html">Kemper Horizon 20+ Portfolio</A> emphasizes growth of
capital with income generation as a secondary objective.  <A
HREF="../funds/horiz10.html">Kemper Horizon 10+ Portfolio</A> seeks a balance of growth
and income with moderate risk.  And <A HREF="../funds/horiz5.html">Kemper Horizon 5
Portfolio</A> seeks income while your capital is being preserved, with growth of
capital as a secondary objective. For more information, <A
HREF="../prospectus.html">download a prospectus now.</A>
<P>
   
<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper6_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper International and Global
Funds">
<BR>

Kemper's London-based management team has a worldwide network of investment
contacts that provides greater access to foreign markets. This allows for a
better understanding of each market, and a closer examination of growth rates,
market niches, balance sheets, and even local issues. Our global research
efforts for <A HREF="../funds/intlglobal.html">Kemper International and Global Funds</A>
cover hundreds of foreign companies, as well as contact with banks, investment
houses and economists worldwide. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>
Returns and net asset values fluctuate.  Shares are not insured or guaranteed
and are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less than
original cost.  Kemper Money Market Fund seeks to maintain a net asset value of
$1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that it will.  Money Fund shares
are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated
securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper High Yield
Fund).  For portfolios that invest internationally (principally Kemper
International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund and Kemper Diversified Income
Fund) there are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that may
adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully discussed in
the funds' prospectuses.
<P>

Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity and
Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Funds) presents greater risk of loss than
investment in large companies.  Concentration in certain market sectors
(Kemper-Dreman High Return) presents special risk considerations.   
<P>

*  Except as otherwise described in the prospectus, income from tax-free funds
may be subject to state and local taxes and, for some investors, the alternative
minimum tax.

Kemper has been an industry leader in developing innovative mutual 
fund concepts:
<P>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>
<A HREF="../funds/mmfunds.html">Kemper Money Market Fund</A> was one of the nation's first money market
funds. (1974)

<LI>
<A HREF="../funds/muni_bond.html">Kemper Municipal Bond Fund</A> was 
the nation's first municipal bond mutual fund. (1976)

<LI>
Kemper Investment Portfolios was one of the first 12-b1 fund families,
enabling investors to invest 100 percent of their money upfront and pay
the cost of distribution over time. (1984).

<LI>
KemFlex was one of the first sophisticated retirement plan recordkeeping
systems to be introduced by a mutual fund distributor, thereby
simplifying plan administration and reducing plan cost. (1988)

<LI>
Kemper addressed the long-term goals - and security concerns - of many
investors with the introduction of the <A HREF="../funds/retire_series.html"> 
Kemper Retirement Fund</A> series,
which guarantees the return of original investments at a set date if
held until maturity and dividends are reinvested. (Investors who redeem
prior to maturity or do not reinvest dividends do not benefit from the
guarantee.) (1990)

<LI>
With PREFERRED K, Kemper created an integrated turnkey approach for
implementing cost-effective 401(k) programs. (1991)

<LI>
Kemper introduced a worldwide fund with the guaranteed return of the
original investment at maturity - <A HREF="../funds/worldwide.html">
Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund</A>. (Investors
who redeem prior to maturity or do not reinvest dividends do not benefit
from the guarantee). (1994)

Supplied with a steady stream of government reports, corporate earnings
releases, analysts' forecasts and miscellaneous other data,
market-watchers are never at a loss for information. Their challenge: To
understand what's in each snapshot - as well as in the surrounding
environment that an individual market report may not have captured.
<P>

Here's where you'll find current market news, including our outlook and economic 
interpretations by John Silvia, chief economist for Kemper Funds' management. 
Because of the changing nature of this information, you'll
want to check back here often.

Of course, markets rise and fall. But individual
investors can't afford to be erratic. As significant and as interesting
as financial market news may be, it's essential for investors to
maintain a certain perspective. Taking a longer view, considering basic
investment principles and tactics, can help a curious investor be a calm
investor.
<P>

Think of The Longer View as your gateway to general investment and
educational information.

<P>
Kemper manages seven closed-end funds designed to meet varying financial goals. Six funds invest in the fixed-income or municipal markets while one fund invests primarily in Spanish equities. 
<P>
A closed-end fund differs from an "open-end" fund (commonly referred to as a "mutual fund") in several important ways:<BR>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>A closed-end fund is usually capitalized through a one-time public offering. New shares may be created only in certain circumstances -- to satisfy dividend reinvestment plan requirements with respect to income and capital gains distributions and occasionally rights offerings, for example. By contrast, an open-end fund continuously issues new shares.
<LI>Once issued, the shares of a closed-end fund are not redeemable by the fund and are exchangeable only in the open market, generally by a listing on a recognized stock exchange.  Shares of Kemper's closed-end funds are traded on the <A HREF="http://www.nyse.com/">New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.chicagostockex.com/">Chicago Stock Exchange (CSE)</A>. Shares of an open-end fund, by contrast, are redeemable by the fund at any time.
<LI>Because the supply of shares of a closed-end fund is finite, the market price of a closed-end fund share is based upon the forces of supply and demand. 
Shares may trade at either above or below their net asset value (NAV) based on their perceived value in the marketplace. This price differential is referred to as a premium or discount to NAV.  Again, by contrast, an open-end fund stands ready at all times to redeem its shares at their current NAV.
<LI>Because all trading of a closed-end fund's shares takes place in the open market, the portfolio manager of a closed-end fund does not need to worry about maintaining cash balances to fund share redemptions. This tends to give the manager more latitude to fully invest the portfolio and to consider a broader range of portfolio securities.

At Kemper Funds, we believe that establishing a relationship with
a professional financial representative is the best way to take
advantage of today's investment alternatives. Mutual funds are excellent
building blocks for your portfolio, with their built-in diversification,
professional management and convenience. And, with over 6,000 funds
available today, we believe the best way to choose among them is with
the guidance and advice of a professional financial advisor.

<P>

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048), 
<A HREF="../prospectus_email.html">
e-mail us your request</A> for a prospectus through the mail or 
<A HREF="../prospectus_download.html">

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048),

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<IMG SRC="gifs/performyield_head.gif" ALT="Performance And Yield Notes">
<BR>

Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares are not insured or guaranteed and
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Money fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments. Total return
calculations assume that you reinvested your dividends. Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/performyield_subhead.gif" ALT="Special Risks">
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund,
Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
<P>

Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of the following
unmanaged indices: the Standard &#38; Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&#38;P Actuaries World Index, which is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total 
return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government 
bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which 
is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Florida Tax-Free Income Fund, Kemper Intermediate
Municipal Bond Fund, Kemper Michigan Tax-Free Income Fund, Kemper New
Jersey Tax-Free Income Fund, Kemper Ohio Tax-Free Income Fund, Kemper
Pennsylvania Tax-Free Income Fund, Kemper Texas Tax-Free Income Fund, 
Kemper Value+Growth Fund and Kemper-Dreman Funds include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by
Kemper Financial Services, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for Kemper Florida Tax-Free Income Fund are no longer in effect
and expenses are generally being reinstated for Kemper Ohio Tax-Free
Income Fund and Kemper Texas Tax-Free Income Fund. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.
<P>

Performance of fund classes will differ.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The economy provides an environment, but the markets are where
investments perform. Securities are bought and sold in many types and
sizes of markets. There are money markets for short-term investors, U.S.
and foreign markets for equities investors and a wide range of U.S. and
foreign government and corporate markets for income investors. Any
number of variables - corporate earnings, government stability,
interest rate movements, just to name a few - influence these markets
and, by extension, your success as an investor.

<IMG SRC="gifs/dear_subhead.gif"><BR>

As we approach the close of 1996, it's remarkable how eventful the year has been and yet, economically, we are essentially where we were one year ago. 
<P>
The fundamentals of the economy are remarkably similar today to what they were in 1995. Long-term interest rates are approximately 6.5% compared to 6.3% in November 1995. The economy is growing at a rate of approximately 2.2%. Inflation continues to be well under control, at about 3.0%.  
<P>
One significant difference between today and one year ago is that stock prices are on average up 20%. While price movements were more volatile in 1996 than in the past few years, the patient investor was amply rewarded. The prime element sending the stock market higher was strong positive cash flows. Such liquidity in an environment of modestly increasing corporate profits and relatively stable interest rates pushed stocks higher for most of the year. 
<P>
This higher stock market has caused many market observers to worry. While we cannot ignore what has happened, we find no reason to be bearish over the long term. The environment is benign to favorable for financial assets. Given steady interest rates, moderate economic growth and continued moderate corporate earnings growth, there are few excesses in the system.  In fact, real interest rates are probably too high considering our outlook for inflation, and we may see them decline over time.
<P>
Naturally, we cannot rule out the possibility of a market correction. But, in our belief, the downside would appear to be limited to 5% to 8%, which is the size of a typical correction based on historical data. As we have said in previous outlooks, three elements tend to move the market:
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE> 
<LI><B>Earnings.</B> We forecast corporate earnings to range between 0% and 5% on average for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500* in 1997 -- not as high as in recent previous years but positive nonetheless.
<P>
<LI><B>Interest rates.</B> Rates should remain stable, and short-term interest rates may even decline.
<P>
<LI><B>Liquidity.</B> Investors, through mutual funds, 401(k)s and qualified contribution plans in particular, will continue to create strong demand for securities.
</UL>
<P>
In order to move the market more than would be expected in a typical decline, one or more of these elements will have to turn negative in 1997, and, while future conditions cannot be predicted with certainty, we fail to see what would materially change our outlook. Our outlook going forward is that 1997 should be a lot like 1996.
<P>
While the economy continued along a relatively consistent path, the United States took some politically significant steps in 1996. First, of course, President Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress were re-elected by the voters. In the first few days after the general election, especially, investors demonstrated their support for such a balance in our leadership. But of much greater long-term significance is the expressed commitment by both parties to balance the federal budget and address certain entitlement programs. The first year after an election can be a fertile time to accomplish major initiatives, and we are hopeful that progress can be made.
<P>
The future of the Social Security system, which many experts believe will run out of money about 20 years from now, will be a subject in which you can expect Zurich Kemper Investments to play a leadership role. The possible solutions for "fixing Social Security" are finite: raise Social Security taxes, reduce benefits, raise the retirement age, change inflation assumptions or pursue a higher rate of return on assets contributed by workers. We believe that a bipartisan solution will be worked out, which will include giving individuals the option of investing a portion of their Social Security contributions in an account earmarked for them. This change is needed to return credibility to the system, which many Americans have lost faith in. What to do with Social Security is a debate that spans generations and promises to occupy much attention in the coming years. As we hope to help advance constructive debate, we'll be advocating partial privatization for this federal program while maintaining a safety net for many low-wage earners and providing a seamless transition for seniors near or in retirement.
<P>
With this letter as an economic backdrop, we encourage you to read the following detailed report of your fund, including an interview with your fund's portfolio management. Thank you for your continued support. We appreciate the opportunity to serve your investment needs.

Most investing is done for the long term. But investors who are looking
for a temporary stopping place or who have only a short time for their
money to work have certain needs. If you're a short-term investor, your
desire to maintain a stable principal may guide the investment decisions
you make. We have some ideas just for you.

<BR>
As an investor, you have a schedule of your own. You know when your
child will be entering college or the number of years until you plan to
retire, for example. But what can be complicated about investing is that
your investing cycle - when you invest and when you use the proceeds -
takes place within the realm of a broader cycle. Your objective as an
investor is to find a way to dovetail your investing cycle with the
unpredictable ups and downs of the overall economy. 

<P>

Planning for Your Child's Future includes what you can do with your own
investments as well as the possibilities with a child's portfolio.
<P>

Be sure to visit Your Retirement for insights on the all-important task
of planning for your retirement.

<BLOCKQUOTE>


In January, Kemper Financial Services, Inc. became an indirect subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Group. In March, KFS changed its name to <A HREF="../about/aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.</A> "The name is different," says Stephen B. Timbers, president, chief executive and chief investment officer, "but our fundamental mission is the same: To manufacture and distribute high quality investment management products and services to individuals and institutions and to help them achieve their long-term financial goals. Our goal is to fulfill this mission better than anyone else in the investment management business."
<P>
The transfer of ownership provided an occasion for us to update our look. Specifically, at the bottom right-hand of every page of Kemper.com, you'll see our new Kemper Funds logo, which includes a "wealthmark." The wealthmark relates to both our Midwest home base and to the concept of harvest.

The site was established as an extension of the services we provide to our shareholders and to the financial representatives who offer Kemper Funds to the investing public.

In August, a second site, <A HREF="http://www.kempercash.com/">kempercash.com</A> debuted. The site, which focuses on money market funds only, is written from the view of an experienced investor based on a private island in the South Pacific.

In addition to its five-star overall rating, <A HREF="../funds/high_return.html">Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund</A> received five stars for the one-, three- and five-year periods.  It was rated among 2,864, 1,724, 1,031 and 575 domestic equity funds for the one-, three- and five-year periods, respectively.   
<P>
<A HREF="../funds/smallcap.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A>  also received five stars for the three-year period in the small company category. For the one-year period, the fund's rating is four stars or "above average." 
<P>
Ten percent of the funds in a rating category receive five stars, and the next 22.5 percent receive four stars.  Morningstar proprietary ratings reflect risk-adjusted performance through October 31, 1996. Ratings are calculated from the funds' three-, five-, and, where applicable, 10-year returns (with fee adjustments) in excess of 90-day Treasury bill returns.  The one-year rating is calculated using the same methodology, but is not a component of the overall rating. Ratings are subject to change every month. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Kemper Funds management proudly sponsors seven professional golfers participating in the 1996 PGA and Senior PGA Tours. While each golfer plays as an individual, each member of our "team" wears the Kemper Funds name on either their chest or on their hat. As you watch their progress this season, whether on television, in print publication coverage or in person, look for the Kemper Funds name.

is 5.75% for Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full
annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. For C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% CDSC 
for shares redeemed within one year.
Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<BR>
Concerns about rising interest rates, the
possibility of higher price inflation and Federal Reserve tightening
of credit continue to contribute to considerable market volatility. But while
the professional investors  tend to debate every economic release,
individuals who invest in mutual funds for the long term have been
wise to stay the course. Indeed, several recent economic measures
are quite reassuring and argue in favor of a continued healthy
economy with low inflation.
<P>
The economy expanded at a 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter,
the fastest pace since the second quarter of 1994. This robust
growth is welcome in general but has tended to roil markets, which
fear strong growth will lead to overheating and inflationary pressures.
So far, however, such fears have been largely unwarranted. With
the exception of food prices, whose increases were weather-related,
there have been no significant signs of inflationary pressures.
As it has so often recently, the economy is in the process of
slowing itself down. While the Federal Reserve Board stands by
ready to attempt to moderate economic growth with either interest
rate cuts or increases, such intervention can run the risk of
going too far in one direction. It appears that our economy today
is self-regulating.
<P>
Based on these snapshots of the economy, then, we look for a relatively
calmer remainder of the year. Our forecast calls for growth to slow
down in the fourth quarter, to result in an advance
of about 2.5% for the entire year. Assuming that bond and stock
market investors concur that there is no chance of an overheating
economy or significantly rising interest rates, the markets should
relax, as well. 
<P>
Our market forecast 10 months into the year is not much different
from what we forecasted in January. The bond market, which is
climbing back from a decline this year, may produce a 5% total
return in 1996. The stock market, after the correction is completed,
may advance 10% to 15% for the year. Naturally, future market conditions
cannot be predicted with assurance.
<P>
In addition, we are projecting that long-term (30-year) interest
rates will hover in the 6.5% to 7.0% range. Short-term interest
rates may drop below their current levels. Finally, we would be
surprised if the Federal Reserve Board moved to adjust interest
rates either way more than 25 basis points for the remainder of
the year.
<P>
Given the economic environment, we do not look for an upset in
the upcoming presidential election. Much more interesting will
be which party wins the most congressional seats. If the Democrats
regain control of Congress, a bond market selloff could be expected.
<P>
While U.S. markets are expected to provide modest returns, we
continue to advocate the benefits of diversification into alternate
markets. Many overseas markets are forecasted to grow at a rate
well above our 2.5% growth expectation for the U.S., and there
are many equity and fixed-income opportunities abroad. The value
of the U.S. dollar, always a concern to international investors,
will probably not strengthen much against other currencies for
the foreseeable future.
<P>
Thank you for your continued support. We appreciate the opportunity to serve your investment
needs.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 5.75% for Kemper Growth Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 5.75% for Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full
annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. For C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% CDSC 
for shares redeemed within one year. Sales charges are reduced or 
eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<H3>KEMPER FUNDS GROUP JOINS SCHWAB'S INSTITUTIONAL ONESOURCE</H3>
<P>
<B>CHICAGO</B> (October 31) -- Kemper Funds management today announced
that it has signed an agreement with Charles Schwab &amp; Co.
to offer Class A shares of 22 mutual funds at net asset value
through Schwab's Institutional OneSource program. Kemper recently
began offering its funds to advisors at net asset value through
Fidelity's Institutional FundsNetwork and Jack White &amp; Co.'s
NoFee Network, and is currently in negotiations with several other
fund &quot;supermarket&quot; programs.
<P>
&quot;Schwab's Institutional OneSource was the next logical step
for us in gaining a stronger foothold in the burgeoning fee-based
advisory channel,&quot; said John Norris, first vice president
and head of the registered investment advisor unit at Kemper Distributors,
Inc., the principal underwriter and distributor for the Kemper
Funds. &quot;In order to be well-positioned in the future, we
need to form relationships with established distribution outlets
that cater to this very important and growing segment of our business.
Schwab is a market leader in providing registered investment advisors
with superior back-office services, so it was very natural for
us to gravitate toward them.&quot;
<P>
Norris emphasized that Kemper remains fully committed to selling
its funds through investment professionals. &quot;We believe in
the power of financial advice and we will continue to expand distribution
relationships with programs where financial advisors are providing
their services to customers.&quot;
<P>
<A HREF="../aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.</A> (ZKI), is the investment advisor
to the <A HREF="../aboutkemper.html"> Kemper Funds</A>, which consists of 30 open-end funds with
over 70 portfolios and seven closed-end funds. Kemper Funds has
nearly $45 billion in assets. ZKI is part of Zurich Insurance
Group, a global organization headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland,
that provides services in life and property-casualty insurance,
reinsurance and asset management in more than 45 countries.

<H3>KEMPER FUNDS SURVEY FINDS TWO OUT OF THREE &quot;EMPTY NESTERS&quot;
GAIN $5,000+ ANNUAL BOOST WHEN KIDS FLY THE COOP; 
DESPITE CONCERNS  ABOUT THE FUTURE, FEW DIVERTING MOST OF
&quot;PARENTAL BONUS&quot; TO RETIREMENT SAVINGS</H3>
<P>
 <B>CHICAGO</B> (August 23) - After decades of paying for their
children's food, clothing, education, sports equipment, dance
lessons and orthodontia, a vast majority of &quot;empty nesters&quot;
enjoyed a significant monetary boost after their children left
home, yet few are diverting most of this &quot;parental bonus&quot;
to their own retirement savings, according to the recent survey
<I><B>Kemper Funds/Age Wave Lifestage Monitor: A National Survey
of Empty Nest Couples.</B></I>
<P>
 The Kemper Funds/Age Wave Lifestage Monitor in March polled by
mail 1,007 married Americans between the ages of 40 and 59, with
incomes of more than $50,000 and whose children had left home
and become financially independent within the past four years.
<P>
 &quot;For many years, Americans have been telling us that they've
had to sacrifice their own retirement savings needs in part to
meet the financial needs of their children,&quot; said William
E. Chapman II, president of Kemper Retirement Plans Group. &quot;So
it's somewhat surprising that once that hurdle is removed, few were willing
to divert the lion's share of that income boost into retirement
savings -- despite the fact that most expressed concern about the amount of money they had saved for retirement so far.&quot;
<P>
  A vast majority (84.5%) of empty nesters surveyed reported that
they received a parental bonus - a boost in income - once their
children left home, finished school and became financially independent.
Of those, two-thirds (66.8%) reported having a boost of income
of $5,000 or more a year; approximately one-third (34.6%) reported
having a boost of more than $10,000 a year; a little less than
one third (29.6%) reported a boost of $1,000 to $4,999, while
3.2% reported having a $1,000 or less annual boost.
<P>
 Even though well over half of those surveyed (60.4%) said they
had not saved enough for retirement, few seem willing to use the
&quot;found&quot; money that came as a result of their children
becoming financially independent for that purpose. Only 40.7%
of those surveyed said that they were spending &quot;all&quot;
or &quot;most&quot; of the parental bonus on retirement. A little
more than half (55.7%) were earmarking only &quot;some&quot; for
retirement savings, and 3.6% were using &quot;none&quot; for retirement.
<P>
 &quot;Our survey uncovered that the parental bonus amounts to
anywhere from a 10% to 20% boost annually,&quot; Chapman pointed
out. &quot;If you pause a moment to think about it, that amount
significantly exceeds projected wage increases expected this year.
What's more, the wage and salary increases are an even smaller
percentage once you take into account taxes. Empty nesters may
be missing a golden opportunity to make up for lost time if they're
not directing this parental bonus to their retirement savings.&quot;
<P>
 Chapman advises that when children leave home, it's a good time
for parents to reassess their financial goals, savings and investment
plans. &quot;Most Americans understand that a change in lifestyle
-- be it getting married, changing jobs, buying a home, or retiring
- requires that they re-examine and modify their financial goals
and objectives. Like those lifestages, having your children leave
home is a critical time for this reassessment.&quot;
<P>
 A significant portion of the parental bonus is being diverted
to debt payments and travel. About one in five (18.4%) of those
surveyed who reported a boost in income when their children left
home said they were spending &quot;all&quot; or &quot;most&quot;
of the parental bonus paying off debts, and 11.7% were spending
&quot;all&quot; or &quot;most&quot; on traveling.
<P>
 Of those who reported some excess income after their children
left, the following number of respondents spent at least &quot;some&quot;
of the parental bonus on:
<UL>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>entertainment/dining (100%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>charitable giving (87.5%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>traveling (81.4%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>&quot;buying things we couldn't afford before&quot; (74.7%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>hobbies (70.4%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>helping children with expenses (69.5%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>remodeling their home (62.9%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>grandchildren (58.8%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>retirement savings (55.7%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>paying off debts (49.3%)
</UL>

<P>
<B>Home, sweet home</B>
<P>
 Few empty nesters are willing to trade in their home for a smaller
version after their children left home. Only 11.8% of respondents
reported moving to a smaller home. Of those who did move, only
14.4% said they did so because they wanted more money to invest;
38.1% said they moved because they didn't need the space of their
former residence.
<P>
<B>Empty nesters welcome boomerang children, but aren't yet
sandwiched</B>
<P>
 &quot;One explanation as to why empty nesters are reluctant to
move to a smaller home is that they may not be convinced that
those kids are gone for good,&quot; Chapman noted. 
<P>
 In fact, one third (33.7%) of empty nesters surveyed have experienced
boomerang children - who leave their parents' home for a brief
period, but return at some point thereafter. And as mentioned
earlier, about three-quarters of the respondents said they were
using some of the parental bonus &quot;to help their children
out&quot; after they had flown the coop. 
<P>
 But contrary to the predictions of some demographers, most empty
nesters haven't yet felt the crunch of the &quot;sandwich,&quot;
in which they are simultaneously responsible for the well-being
of both their children and their parents or other elderly relatives.
Less than one-quarter (22.2%) reported that they were caregivers
for elderly relatives. Of those who are caregivers, very few (13.4%)
are financially responsible for those elderly relatives. Interestingly,
roughly two-thirds (63.4%) of respondents who said they were caregivers
also reported that they managed their elderly relatives' financial
affairs.<P>
<P>

<B>Lots of toys for tots, less money for ABCs</B>
<P>
 Among those empty nesters surveyed, 59.6% reported having grandchildren.
Of those with grandchildren, 20.8% reported spending more than
$1,000 on annual savings for their grandchildren's education or
investments. More than double that amount (45.1%) spent $1,000
per year on toys, clothes and entertainment for their grandkids.
<P>
 &quot;Grandparents often are more motivated by their grandchildren's
gratitude to indulge their most immediate needs and desires, rather
than to provide for their grandchildren's future financial needs,&quot;
Chapman said.

<H3>KEMPER MONEY FUNDS BUILD A SOUTH PACIFIC HIDE-AWAY ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB</H3>
<P>
<B>CHICAGO</B> (August 19) -- Have a question about money market funds?
 If you do, it's time to pay a visit to a mysterious millionaire
located at <A HREF="http://www.kempercash.com">kempercash.com.</A>  This experienced investor, based on
a private island in the South Pacific, guides visitors through
the essentials of money market funds.
<P>
 &quot;While islands in the South Pacific usually don't come to
mind when you think about money funds, we thought this would be
an unusual 'location' for our new web site,&quot; said Mike Harrington,
the Kemper Funds Group senior vice president for money fund marketing.
 &quot;Our goal was to create a relaxed site on an essential,
yet overlooked, investment.&quot;
<P>
 Harrington added that while several large fund families, including
Kemper Funds, have web sites featuring their entire investment
line-up, this is the first site that just focuses on a particular
fund category.
<P>
Drawing on his years of investment experience, the site's host
provides comprehensive information on how to select a money fund.
 His &quot;Financial Jargon to Plain English Dictionary,&quot;
which defines relevant terms such as commercial paper and repurchase
agreements, is designed to, &quot;...help make you fluent when
talking about money fund investments.&quot;  Current 7-day yields
and competitive rankings for Kemper Money Market Fund, Kemper
Government Money Fund and Kemper Tax-Free Money Fund are available.
 The site also allows visitors to try two different investment
scenarios with Kemper Money Market Fund.
<P>
 Harrington stated that the site will be expanded to offer new
features and to reflect visitor feedback.  The site just established
reciprocal links with the IBC/Financial Data web site and will
soon add the Kemper Money Funds prospectus and an application.
 <P>
 The <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> for the Kemper Money Funds containing more complete
information, including management fees and expenses, is available
by calling 800/537-6001.  Investors should read it carefully before investing
or sending money.  Money funds seek to maintain a net asset value
of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
 Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>
<A HREF="../../about/aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.</A> (ZKI), formerly Kemper Financial
Services, Inc., is one of the largest investment managers headquartered
in North America, having more than $78 billion in assets under management.  ZKI is the
investment advisor to the Kemper Funds.
<P>
 The Kemper Family of Funds consists of 36 funds, with over 70
portfolios, representing approximately $45 billion in assets and

<H3>PATRICK ADAMS NAMED PORTFOLIO MANAGER OF KEMPER FUNDS FLAGSHIP GROWTH EQUITY FUND</H3>

<P>
 <B>CHICAGO</B> (June 3) -- In a move designed to further strengthen
its position as a leading equity mutual fund manager, Kemper Funds
management today announced that Patrick S. Adams, 35, has been
named portfolio manager of the $2.6 billion <A HREF="../../funds/growth.html">Kemper Growth Fund</A>,
the company's flagship growth equity mutual fund.  Adams replaces
chief investment officer for equities, Steven H. Reynolds, who
has been the Fund's interim manager since September 1995.  Adams
will report directly to Reynolds.
<P>
 &quot;We are thrilled to have a person of Pat's caliber at the
helm of our flagship growth equity fund,&quot; said Reynolds.
 &quot;His experience as a growth manager and his impressive record
will not only benefit our current Kemper Growth Fund shareholders,
but will enhance our ability to provide consistent, quality, growth-style
investment management expertise.&quot;
<P>
 Adams joins Kemper from Founders Asset Management in Denver,
Colo., where he managed the $400 million Founders Blue Chip Fund
and the $160 million Founders Balanced Fund.  Previously, he was
director of research and senior portfolio manager at
First Of America Investment Corporation, the investment manager
for the Parkstone Group of Funds.  From 1990 to 1992, he managed
the Parkstone Equity Fund, a $600 million growth fund.
<P>
 The addition of Adams to Kemper Funds' equity investment team
is the latest action by Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. (ZKI),
the investment adviser to the Kemper Funds, in its plan to further
strengthen its  equity investment capabilities.  In August 1995,
a company subsidiary acquired substantially all of the assets
of Dreman Value Management, L.P., enabling the company to provide
retail and institutional clients with an enhanced product offering
that includes the value style of equity investing.  As part of
the acquisition, Kemper assumed management responsibility for
the <A  HREF="../../funds/high_return.html">Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund</A>,
<A  HREF="../../funds/contrarian.html">Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund</A>
and <A  HREF="../../funds/smallcap.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A>. 
Shortly after the Dreman acquisition, Kemper hired veteran portfolio manager Steven Reynolds
from Alliance Capital Management to oversee and direct the company's
equity investment department.
<P>
 In addition to assuming responsibility for the Kemper-Dreman
Funds, the company has also expanded its equity product offering
considerably since August of 1995 by introducing three new funds:
<A  HREF="../../funds/valuegrowth.html">Kemper Value+Growth Fund</A>,
<A  HREF="../../funds/horiz20.html">Kemper Horizon Fund</A> and
<A  HREF="../../funds/europe.html">Kemper Europe Fund</A>.

<P>
 &quot;These bold actions on the equity side of our investment
management business support our company's strategic plan for growth
and success, and we will continue to aggressively implement our
expansion plan to help ensure our position as one of the leading
equity mutual fund managers in the industry,&quot; said Stephen
B. Timbers, chief executive officer and chief investment officer
at ZKI.
<P>
 Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Financial
Services, Inc., is one of the largest investment managers headquartered
in North America.  Together with its affiliates, ZKI has more
than $79 billion in assets under management.  The company operates
with three strategic business units: retail mutual funds, retirement
plans and institutional asset management.  ZKI is the investment
adviser to the Kemper Funds and is part of Zurich Insurance Group,
a global organization headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, that
provides services in life and non-life insurance, reinsurance

<H3>KEMPER FUNDS MARKS 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF NATION'S FIRST RETAIL MUNICIPAL
BOND FUND</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (April 23) -- Twenty years ago this month Kemper Financial Services launched 
the <A HREF="../../funds/muni_bond.html">Kemper Municipal Bond Fund</A>, the nation's first municipal 
bond fund designed for individual investors.  The municipal bond mutual fund management was 
pioneered largely through the efforts and vision of the fund's first manager, the late Robert J. Butler.
<P>

"Bob Butler was noted for his work in developing new investment products, 
including the Kemper Municipal Bond Fund.  The introduction of a municipal bond fund 
tailored for individual investors represented a major innovation in tax-free investing and 
underscored Kemper's reputation as an innovator in the mutual fund arena," said Chris 
Mier, senior vice president and portfolio manager for all of Kemper's tax-free income funds. 
"The Kemper Municipal Bond Fund paved the way for wider participation in the tax-exempt 
market by individuals with small sums to invest."
<P>

From its inception date on April 20, 1976, the Kemper Municipal Bond Fund has had 
only three portfolio managers -- Robert Butler (1976 - 1985), J. Patrick Beimford (1985 - 
1992) and Chris Mier (1989 - present).  Kemper manages 10 
<A HREF="../../funds/taxfree.html">tax-free income funds</A>, including an intermediate-term fund and 
eight single state funds, representing assets of more than $5 billion.
<P>

<B>The Municipal Bond Market: Then and Now</B>
<P>

Chris Mier, a 20-year veteran of the municipal bond market, points out a number of 
significant changes in the municipal bond industry during the past two decades.
<P>

"While the municipal bond market has grown in size and sophistication, it is still a 
diffuse, over-the-counter market with no central trading arena.  What has changed are the 
make-up of the market, the players, the technology and the sophistication of portfolio 
management practices."  In particular, Mier cites:
<UL>
<LI>Market participants:  "Twenty years ago, most muni bond investors typically were banks, 
bank trust departments and property-casualty insurers.  Today, individual investors 
account for approximately two-thirds of muni bond holdings acting through mutual 
funds, trust departments and on their own behalf."
</LI><P>
<LI>Credit quality:  "Increasingly, insurance has become a major feature of the municipal 
marketplace.  In 1976, insurance on municipal bonds didn't exist.  In 1995, more than 
43 percent of new issuance came to the market insured."
</LI><P>
<LI>Market composition:  "In 1976, tax-free investing was fairly simple.  Plain vanilla general 
obligation bonds comprised roughly half of the municipal market.  Changes in tax laws 
at the federal and state levels altered the ways in which municipalities and states finance 
their capital needs.  At present, revenue bonds make up 62 percent of the muni bond 
market, and general obligation bonds now make up less than 38 percent."
</LI><P>
<LI>Technological advancements:  "Price information is more readily available today, 
resulting in narrower bid-ask spreads and a more efficient market.  Additionally, more 
professional investors are employing sophisticated analytical tools.  Today, fund 
managers are focused on complex strategies involving management of duration, 
convexity and option-adjusted spreads in the marketplace.  In the past, portfolio 
managers used a 'basis book' to calculate yields.  Now they use desktop computer 
systems to compute duration and other financial information."
</LI>
</UL>

<B>The Future</B>
<P>
Over the next several years, Mier sees a continuation of some of the trends that have 
helped shape the municipal bond market over the previous 20 years.
<P>

"Portfolio managers will make greater use of technology in order to employ more 
sophisticated trading techniques as well as sophisticated risk management and 
performance attribution tools," said Mier.
<P>

<H3>ZURICH KEMPER INVESTMENTS LAUNCHES NEW RETIREMENT PLANS UNIT</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (April 2) -- As part of a strategic plan to further 
strengthen its position as a leading provider of qualified retirement 
plan products and services, Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. 
(formerly Kemper Financial Services, Inc.) has formed a new strategic 
business unit, Kemper Retirement Plans Group.
<P>

"The formation of a separate, stand alone business unit to support and 
service qualified plans underscores our commitment to this increasingly 
important marketplace," said Stephen B. Timbers, president, chief 
executive officer and chief investment officer of Zurich Kemper 
Investments, Inc.
<P>

Separately, the company announced that William E. Chapman II has been 
named president of the Kemper Retirement Plans unit.  Chapman was formerly 
executive vice president of marketing and product management for Kemper.  
He has more than 30 years experience in the retirement plans business.
<P>

"Bill Chapman is a seasoned veteran and an accomplished executive with a 
tremendous wealth of knowledge and expertise in the qualified plans arena," 
said Timbers.  "Under his capable direction, we are confident that our 
retirement plan business will grow significantly and that in a few short 
years Kemper will be recognized as one of the leading providers of 
retirement plan products and services to businesses of all sizes."
<P>

"Our vision is clear: by the year 2000, we expect to be the acknowledged 
leader in the retirement plan business in a much broader sense than we are 
today," said Chapman.  "One of our first priorities is to increase our 
sales capability to support the broker-sold market and at the same time, 
hire salespeople to directly market to larger plan sponsors."
<P>

Chapman cited several other factors that he believes will drive Kemper's 
success in the coming years.  These factors include superior recordkeeping; 
innovative and broad use of technology to service the needs of 
participants, plan sponsors and administrators; and investment products 
that "make sense" to plan participants and address their investment needs 
and expectations.
<P>

With more than 45 years of professional investment management experience, 
Kemper has long been a household name for investment products and services. 
 Kemper is an experienced qualified plan provider who currently serves more 
than 8,000 plans and manages more than $4 billion in retirement plan 
assets.  The company believes it was the first to dispatch a field sales 
force committed exclusively to supporting qualified plan sales, and also 
the first to establish a fully dedicated in-house retirement plan marketing 
staff to market the company's retirement plans.
<P>

Kemper Retirement Plans is a unit of Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. (ZKI). 
 ZKI is the investment manager for the <A HREF="../../funds/kemperfunds.html">Kemper Funds</A>.  
Kemper Funds consists of 61 open-end portfolios and seven closed-end portfolios.  It has nearly 3 
million shareholder accounts and approximately $45 billion in retail assets.
<P>

<A HREF="../../prospectus.html">Prospectuses</A> for the Kemper Funds are available from the 
principal underwriter, Kemper Distributors, Inc.  They contain more complete information including 
fees and expenses and should be read carefully before investing or sending money.

in Zurich, Switzerland that provides services in life and non-life 
insurance, reinsurance and asset management in more than 45 countries.

<H3>KEMPER FUNDS FORMS NEW DISTRIBUTION UNIT FOR FEE-BASED ADVISERS AND MUTUAL FUND WRAP PROGRAMS</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (Mar. 20) -- Kemper Funds management today announced the formation 
of a new distribution unit to focus on the growing fee-based adviser and mutual fund wrap 
marketplace.
<P>

"While we are fully committed to selling our funds through the traditional channels 
of distribution, we recognize the increasingly important role of registered investment 
advisers and fee-based programs," said Jim Greenawalt, executive vice president, director of 
sales for Kemper Distributors, Inc., the principal underwriter and distributor for the 
Kemper Funds.  "We have always believed in and have stressed the importance of investors 
working with professional financial advisers when it comes to making their investment 
decisions.  And, as long as a customer is working directly with a financial adviser, we will be 
flexible with our pricing structure."
<P>

Kemper has hired John A. Norris as a first vice president to head up the new 
registered investment adviser unit.  Norris was previously a senior vice president at Cozad 
Asset Management, Inc.  He will seek to form strategic alliances with various fee-based 
mutual fund wrap programs.
<P>

"We expect to further strengthen our relationships with our key broker/dealer clients 
as they expand their fee-based activities," said Norris.
<P>

Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. (ZKI), formerly Kemper Financial Services, Inc., is 
one of the largest investment managers headquartered in North America, having more than 
$79 billion in assets under management.  ZKI is the investment advisor to the 
<A HREF="../../funds/kemperfunds.html">Kemper Funds</A> and is part of Zurich Insurance Group, 
a global organization headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland that provides services in life and non-life 
insurance, reinsurance and asset management in more than 45 countries.
<P>

has nearly 3 million shareholder accounts and $45 billion in assets.  Kemper Distributors, 
Inc. (KDI), a subsidiary of ZKI, is the principal underwriter and distributor of the Kemper 
Funds.

CHICAGO (January 4, 1996) - Zurich Insurance Group and Insurance
Partners today announced the completion of the acquisition of Kemper

valued at more than $2 billion. Kemper common stockholders will receive
cash consideration of $49.80 per share in the merger.

Rolf H&uuml;ppi, chairman and chief executive officer of The Zurich Insurance
Group said, "The completion of this transaction marks a significant step
toward implementing our financial services strategy. With the
acquisition, Zurich will be able to move closer to our goal of deriving
30 percent of our total revenues from life insurance operations and
build a solid foundation for its worldwide asset management business."
Mr. H&uuml;ppi continued, "We appreciate the efforts of the management and
staff of Kemper over the past months during this transition period."
<P>

Kemper Corporation, a financial services holding company with principal
operations in asset management and life insurance, had approximately $98
billion in life insurance premiums in force; KFS ranked as the nation's
13th largest mutual fund family with $42 billion in mutual fund assets
under management and managed $21 billion in institutional assets.

<H3>KEMPER ROLLS OUT EXECUTIVE PLUS - A RETIREMENT PLAN SOLUTION FOR KEY
EXECUTIVES</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (November 28) - Kemper today announced the introduction of
Executive Plus, a new turnkey nonqualified deferred compensation program
for key executives that can offer a solution to the sometimes
restrictive requirements of qualified retirement plans.
<P>

"Executive Plus is a retirement option for 401(k) plan sponsors looking
to provide additional tax-deferred investing opportunities to key
executives," said Ed Miner, first vice president of Kemper's qualified
plans area. Last year's tax code changes lowered the maximum
compensation on which qualified plan benefits can be based to $150,000,
making it difficult for executives to accumulate desired retirement
assets in traditional qualified plans. Additionally, many sponsors have
had to further reduce executive 401(k) salary deferral levels below the
$9,240 limit in order to pass nondiscrimination tests.
<P>

"Under Executive Plus a participant may defer compensation on a pre-tax
basis until those dollars are needed for retirement. Contributions and
any investment earnings generally are not taxable to the participant
until they are received," Miner said. 
<P>

"In addition, the employer also may contribute to the nonqualified plan
on behalf of the participant. These contributions, as well as
compensation deferred by participants, are not tax-deductible until they
are paid to the participant, usually at retirement."
<P>

Some of the benefits of Executive Plus include:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
A flexible plan agreement
<P>

<LI>
Safe harbor model rabbi trust
<P>

<LI>
Corporate trustee services through Trust Company of America, Inc. (Not
affiliated with Kemper. The trustee services will be provided through a
separate agreement with that company.)
<P>

Opportunity for current Kemper qualified plan clients to combine
nonqualified plan assets with assets in a Kemper qualified plan to
produce pricing breaks.
</UL>

<BR>

Unlike qualified plans, nonqualified programs have no contribution
dollar limits or employee coverage, eligibility or participation
requirements. As a result, their sponsors avoid complex reporting and
compliance testing necessary for qualified plans. Generally, reporting
involves only a one-time filing with the Department of Labor. Plan
adoption is easier because a sponsor avoids many of the formal set-up
requirements of a qualified plan. 
<P>

Usually, nonqualified plans are sponsored by C corporations. Because the
owners of S corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships are
taxed as pass-through entities, nonqualified deferred compensation plans
do not provide effective deferral of compensation for owners of these
entities.
<P>

Program costs vary by provider but typically involve fees for legal
counsel corporate trustee services and the plan's funding mechanism. For
more information about Executive Plus, employers should talk with their
financial representative or call Kemper Sales Support at 1-800-621-5027

<H3>KEMPER FINANCIAL COMPLETES ACQUISITION
OF DREMAN VALUE MANAGEMENT ASSETS; NAMES PRESIDENT &amp; CEO OF ACQUIRED
OPERATIONS</H3>


<B>CHICAGO</B> (August 24) - Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (KFS), a
subsidiary of Kemper Corporation (NYSE: KEM) and the investment advisor
to the Kemper Mutual Funds, today announced the completion of the
acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Dreman Value
Management, L.P. (DVM), including assignment of the Dreman mutual funds
advisory contracts. Specific terms of the transaction were not
disclosed.
<P>

Separately, the company announced that James R. Neel has been named
president and chief executive officer of Kemper Advisors, Inc., a
subsidiary of KFS and the investment advisor to the Kemper-Dreman funds.
<P>

The Dreman mutual funds will be renamed as follows: 
the <A HREF="../../funds/high_return.html"> Kemper-Dreman
High Return Fund</A>, the <A HREF="../../funds/smallcap.html">
 Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A>, the
<A HREF="../../funds/contrarian.html"> Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund</A> 
and the Kemper-Dreman Fixed Income Fund.
<P>

"The closing of this transaction is significant because it immediately
allows us to provide retail and institutional clients with an enhanced
product offering that includes the value style of equity investing,"
said Stephen B. Timbers, chairman and chief executive officer of KFS.
"Furthermore, the acquisition affords Kemper tremendous flexibility in
bringing new products to market."
<P>

As previously reported, the investment functions of KFS and the acquired
operation will remain separate. David Dreman will remain as chairman of
the acquired operation. "We are extremely pleased that David will
continue to play an integral role in the new company, including his
active participation in managing key retail and institutional
portfolios," said Timbers.
<P>

The acquired operation will continue to be based in New Jersey. "By
keeping the investment functions separate, we believe that the
operations will retain the integrity of their investment process and
discipline," said Timbers.
<P>

Neel most recently was an executive vice president and equity portfolio
manager for Kemper Financial's institutional accounts. Prior to that he
managed several of the Kemper retail mutual funds and served as chief
equity strategist. He has been with KFS for six years. Before joining
KFS, Neel was with Loomis Sayles &amp; Co. where he managed a variety of
investment portfolios.
<P>

"We are delighted to have a person of Jim's caliber in the role of
president and CEO," said Timbers. "He is a highly qualified and
recognized professional in the investment community. His experience
coupled with his knowledge of Kemper will benefit him significantly in
his new position."
<P>

KFS has approximately $43.7 billion in mutual fund assets under
management, including 30 open-end funds and seven closed-end funds, as
of July 31, 1995. KFS' domestic institutional subsidiary, Kemper Asset
Management Company, has approximately $5.3 billion under management, not
including assets managed for Kemper Corporation's affiliates and the
Kemper National Insurance Companies. The acquired operation currently
has approximately $1.5 billion of institutional assets under management.
<P>

Kemper Financial Services, Inc. is one of the nation's largest asset
managers with more than $63 billion under management. It is a subsidiary
of Kemper Corporation, a holding company with principal operations in
asset management and life insurance.

<H3>CHANGING DEFINITION OF RETIREMENT:
<BR>
MAJORITY OF AMERICANS EXPECT TO WORK DURING RETIREMENT,  ACCORDING TO
KEMPER-ROPER RETIREMENT MONITOR
</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (June 15) - A majority of working Americans believe they will be
forced to continue to work during retirement in order to make ends meet
and maintain their desired standard of living, according to a poll
released today by Kemper and Roper-Starch Worldwide.
<P>

The "Kemper-Roper Retirement Monitor" polled 2,086 randomly selected
Americans about their attitudes and expectations regarding retirement.
The survey included representation from demographic age groups
including: 20-Somethings (aged 20-29), Baby Boomers (aged 30-49),
Pre-retirees (aged 50-64) and Retirees (aged 65 and older). The survey
has a margin of error of plus/minus two percent.
<P>

"For Americans under the age of 50, the word "retirement" has taken on
new meaning," said William E. Chapman II, executive vice president of
Kemper. "When America's younger generations hit retirement age, it won't
necessarily mean the end of their working years - especially if they
want to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. Their challenge is to plan
carefully in an environment that is much more dynamic than their parents
had to contend with."
<P>

<B>Wages to replace Social Security, savings shortfalls</B>
<P>

"The old yardsticks by which current retirees measure their success in
funding a comfortable retirement no longer apply to younger Americans,"
noted Chapman. "These younger generations will try to fill the gap left
by what they expect to be limited Social Security benefits, diminished
health-care support and the lack of their own savings with wages earned
during retirement," Chapman predicted, and pointed to a number of
findings to support that claim:
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
A vast majority of the two younger generations surveyed - 71% of Baby
Boomers and 81% of 20-Somethings - believe that Social Security will not
be there for them. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Some 65% of Baby Boomers and 74% of 20-Somethings acknowledged that
they were not saving enough for retirement. Paying off a mortgage,
reducing credit card debt, and the costs of raising children are cited
as barriers to saving more.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Despite their pessimistic expectations about government benefits they
might receive in retirement and their inadequate level of savings, 61%
of 20-Somethings and 68% of Baby Boomers believe that they will have
enough to live comfortably during retirement. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Nearly six out of 10 of working Americans surveyed believe that they
will need to work - at least part-time - during their retirement years.
Fortunately, perhaps, the same amount of respondents said they <B><I>want</I></B> to
continue working after retirement, regardless of their financial status.

<P>

<B>20-Somethings, Boomers and Pre-retirees seek more advice</B>
<P>

"Clearly, most Americans understand the importance of carefully planning
for retirement, so attitude is not the problem," Chapman said. "Rather,
changing political and economic conditions are causing uncertainty.
Despite the dearth of information available on retirement planning,
Americans are still clamoring for help." 
<P>

An overwhelming majority of 20-Somethings (69%), Baby Boomers (65%), and
Pre-Retirees (65%) said that their respective generations need more help
planning for retirement. Roughly one in three of 20-Somethings and Baby
Boomers and one in five Pre-Retirees feel "uncertain" or "at a total
loss" when it comes to planning for their own retirement.
<P>

When asked who they did or will turn to for advice on most of their
retirement planning, Americans cite a number of sources: a broker or
financial advisor (39%); spouse (37%); friends (24%); parents (23%);
other family members (15%); personal finance magazines (12%); research
publications (6%); and on-line financial services (3%).
<P>

Six out of 10 Americans felt they need a broker or financial advisor to
help them cut through the clutter and deal with all the information out
there about investments. Yet most weren't very confident in their
ability to chose a broker or financial advisor. More than half of the
20-Somethings and Baby Boomers feel either "uncertain" or "at a total
loss" when it comes to knowing how to select a broker or financial
advisor. 
<P>

<B>Among the survey's other key findings:</B>
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
When asked what one piece of advice they would give younger generations
about saving for retirement, retirees said "start saving early" (62%),
and "take advantage of company sponsored savings plans (18%). Few
mentioned "save more money" (8%). Not surprisingly, 47% of retirees said
they did not start saving early enough for retirement. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Only one in four retirees said they were able to accurately predict
their financial needs before they retired. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Americans across all groups named company sponsored plans - including
401(k)
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
(52%) and 403(b) (4%) plans - as their top retirement savings vehicle,
followed by savings accounts (44%), mutual funds (40%), life insurance
(39%) and IRA or Keogh accounts (39%). 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Roughly two out of three Americans say that they share the
decision-making about investing for retirement with their spouse.

<H3>"20-SOMETHINGS" NO SLACKERS WHEN IT COMES TO RETIREMENT PLANNING, 
ACCORDING TO KEMPER-ROPER RETIREMENT MONITOR</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (June 15) - When it comes to retirement, Americans in their 20s
shatter the "slacker" myth of being lost and living for the now,
according to a poll released today by Kemper and Roper-Starch Worldwide.
<P>

The "Kemper-Roper Retirement Monitor" polled 2,086 randomly selected
Americans about their attitudes and expectations regarding retirement.
The survey included representation from demographic age groups
including: 20-Somethings (aged 20-29), Baby Boomers (aged 30-49),
Pre-retirees (aged 50-64) and Retirees (aged 65 and older). The survey
has a margin of error of plus/minus two percent.
<P>

"The so-called '20-Something' generation shows surprising sophistication
about issues pertaining to planning, saving, and investing for
retirement," said William E. Chapman II, executive vice president of
Kemper. "They are cognizant of their responsibility to plan, are willing
to hold off on personal consumption in order to save for retirement, and
have thought seriously about their future and their retirement."
<P>

<B>Among the survey's key findings:</B>
<P>

<UL>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Half (50%) of 20-Somethings said they had started putting money away for
retirement within the last one to five years. In contrast, 40% of Baby
Boomers aged 40 to 44, and 35% of Boomers aged 45 to 49, waited until at
least their 30s to start saving for retirement.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
61% of Americans in their 20s said they or their spouse had put money
aside for retirement in either savings or investments, while 71% of Baby
Boomers said the same.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
58% of 20-Somethings said they or their spouse had put money into a
401(K), somewhat more than 52% of the Baby Boomers who indicated that
they had done so.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Roughly three out of four 20-Somethings said that retirement is a
priority in their savings plan; 20-Somethings are as likely as Baby
Boomers to say that retirement is something they think a great deal
about. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
20-Somethings (55%) were as likely as Baby Boomers (53%) to say they are
prepared to reduce personal spending now in order to save for
retirement.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
About one in four 20-Somethings reported that they had increased the
amount of money they put into retirement savings during the past year;
39% of Baby Boomers reported doing the same.

<H3>FIVE THINGS INVESTORS SHOULD KNOW BEFORE
CHOOSING A MONEY MARKET FUND</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (May 31) - Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (KFS), the investment
adviser to Kemper Money Market Fund, today announced it is offering a
free brochure to help savers and investors make wise decisions when
selecting a money market fund. Titled <EM><STRONG>Shopping Around for a Money Market
Fund? Five Things You Should Know Before You Invest</EM></STRONG>, 
the brochure can be obtained by calling 1-800-694-1080, 
ext. 501.
<P>

The brochure identifies five important considerations in choosing a
money market fund and offers guidelines for understanding each
consideration.
<P>

"Money market funds are an essential building block for any sound
financial plan. They are designed to deliver money market yields and to
maintain stability of principal," said Michele Rudin, director of retail
money fund marketing at KFS. "Yet, some money market funds have turned
to risky strategies to deliver higher yields. Helping to educate
investors on how to make sound investment decisions is one of our
primary goals."
<P>

According to the money fund specialists at Kemper, whether a person is a
conservative saver or a savvy investor, there are a few things he or she
should know before choosing a money market fund, including:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
consider your tax bracket and the benefits of taxable versus tax-
exempt income
<P>

<LI>
look for consistent performance over time, not just today's hottest
yields
<P>

<LI>
check out the fund's expenses and how big a bite they will take out 
of your return
<P>

<LI>
think about the account services you will use and find out if they 
will cost you extra
<P>

<LI>
take a look at the fund's sponsor and track record
</UL>

<BR>

Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (KFS) was formed in 1948 when five Chicago 
entrepreneurs formed a mutual fund to capitalize on a technological breakthrough called 
television. They started Television Shares Management Corporation, and their Television 
Fund was the first to focus on the success and technological advances related to the 
television industry. Through successful innovation and diversification, KFS has enjoyed 
more than four decades of growth and prosperity. From its predecessor company 
managing a single mutual fund in 1948, KFS has grown to manage more than 28 different 
open-end mutual fund offerings as well as several closed-end funds. With more than $63 
billion in assets under management, KFS is one of the nation's largest asset management 
firms and a recognized leader in the financial services industry.

Zurich companies comply with federal, state and local laws governing
employment and business practices, and provide equal employment opportunities
to all applicants and employees in a manner that will not discriminate against
any person because of race, color, religion, age, sex. national origin,
disability or other status protected by applicable law.<BR>
<BR>
Carefully read the following statements <STRONG>BEFORE</STRONG> agreeing
below.<BR>
<BR>
I understand that accuracy and completeness of the information provided
on this application are required. I understand that any misstatement or
omission of fact on this application may result in the failure to be hired
or discharged.<BR>
<BR>
I understand that it is a requirement of employment that I be bonded (at
the expense of the employer) and that my employment is therefore subject
to my acceptance by the bonding company.<BR>
<BR>
I authorize Zurich to make a thorough investigation of my past employment,
education and other activities and release from all liability all persons
and entities supplying such information. I understand that it is the practice
of this company to obtain fingerprints of all employees and submit them
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I agree, if employed, to permit
Zurich to obtain my fingerprints.<BR>
<BR>
I understand that some positions at Zurich have special continuing qualification
requirements, such as the acquisition and maintenance of a license and/or
the passing of an examination after employment begins, or such other qualification
requirements as may be established by the company, and acknowledge that
employment in any position must terminate if a job qualification requirement
is not met.<BR>
<BR>
I understand that as part of the normal procedure for processing my employment
application, a consumer report may be prepared. Such reports may include
information as to credit standing, character and general reputation. I also
understand that I have the right to make a written request within a reasonable
period of time to receive additional detailed information about the nature
and scope of this investigation.<BR>
<BR>
In the event that I am hired, and as a requirement of any employment with
Zurich, I agree to conform to the rules and standards of conduct of my employing
company. I understand that my employment can be terminated for any or no
reason and with or without notice, at any time, at the option of either
the company or myself. I understand that no employee or agent of Zurich
is authorized to offer me an employment relationship other than one that
is terminable at will.<BR>
<BR>
I also understand and agree that the terms and conditions of my employment
(other than my at-will status) as well as any employee benefits with Zurich
may be changed or discontinued at any time with or without notice.

Career change. Health concerns. Money issues in a relationship.
<P>
Chances are that either you or someone you know is experiencing
one or more of these issues in everyday life. If so, you may benefit
from viewing one of the new self-help videotapes produced by WETA
in Washington, D.C., in conjunction with the new public television
series &quot;In the Prime.&quot; &quot;In the Prime,&quot; a 26-part
television series dealing with issues and topics for people who
are in the prime of their life, was underwritten by Kemper Funds
Group. 
<P>
<I>Couples and Money</I> Psychotherapist Olivia Mellan is a ground-breaker
in the field of money psychology and conflict resolution. Mellan
explains what makes people irrational about money and identifies
money myths, money personalities and the dynamics of couples and
money.
<P>
<I>The Mind-Body Connection</I> James S. Gordon, M.D., a Harvard
Medical School graduate, takes an approach that emphasizes the
power of self-care through self-awareness, meditation, relaxation,
self-hypnosis, nutrition and exercise. This video shows how these
techniques and approaches -- from acupuncture to herbalism, from
meditation to massage -- improve health and treat serious illnesses.

<P>
<I>Changing Careers</I> Through a series of simple exercises,
motivational speaker, author and career specialist Carole Hyatt
helps viewers identify their own &quot;strands&quot; and explore
how to reweave them into new patterns to create their next careers.
<P>
As the national underwriter of &quot;In the Prime,&quot; Kemper
Funds Group can offer these videos at a significant discount.
When offered through normal channels, the videos sell for $24.95
each with postage and handling. But you can purchase each for
only $14.95 with postage and handling by calling (800) 498-4041.
That's a $10 savings on each video.
<P>
 &quot;In the Prime&quot; can be seen weekly throughout most of
the country on the local PBS affiliate. <A HREF="intheprime_times.html">Check local listings</A>
for times.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 5.75% for Kemper Technology Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 5.75% for Kemper Total Return Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 4.50% for Kemper Income and Capital Preservation Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 5.75% for Kemper Value+Growth Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. For C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% 
CDSC for shares redeemed within one year. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 5.75% for Kemper Horizon 20+ Portfolio. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full
annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. For C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% CDSC for shares redeemed within one year. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048),

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell

contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 5.75% for Kemper Horizon 5 Portfolio. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full
annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. For C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% CDSC for shares redeemed within one year. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.

ALT="Small Businesses To Benefit From Pension Law Changes">

<BR CLEAR=ALL> 

With the new pension law changes, small businesses are expected

to be among the biggest winners.  In fact, according to estimates

by the <A HREF="http://www.dol.gov">U.S. Department of Labor</A> 

and the Profit Sharing/401(k)

Council of America, at least 10 million workers could benefit

from the changes in the pension laws.

<P>

One of the most critical pieces of the legislation includes a

new savings plan option called SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match

Plan for Employees).  With SIMPLE, employers of 100 or fewer employees

would be able to set up a plan using a one-page form.  In addition,

the cumbersome task of conducting nondiscrimination testing will

no longer be required, making it even easier to set up a plan.

 

<P>

SIMPLE contributions will be immediately vested and fully portable,

making it easier for employers to accept plan rollovers.  Employers

must contribute 3 percent of pay for participating employees or

2 percent of pay for all employees earning at least $5,000, whether

or not they participate.  Under a special rule, the match could

be reduced (but not below 1 percent) in not more than two out

of any five years.  As incentive to keep participants in the plan,

the distribution penalty tax is increased to 25 percent under

SIMPLE and applies to distributions made within the first two

years the employee first participates in the plan.

<P>

The new laws now allow tax-exempt organizations, other than state

and local governments, to offer 401(k) plans to their workers.

 Further changes include the repeal of the family aggregation

law, which will now enable relatives who work in a family business

to earn their own retirement benefits without undue restrictions.

<P>

Consult your tax or legal advisor for a better understanding of

the new legislation and how it may impact your business. If you

know his or her e-mail address, <A HREF="mailto:">

send an e-mail now</A>.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="gifs/helpprotect_head.gif" ALT="Help Protect Your Company's Retirement Plan From Claims"><BR> 
A decision by the Supreme Court this past March (<I>Varity Corp.
v. Howe</I>) ruled that plan beneficiaries may sue on their own
behalf for breaches of fiduciary duty under ERISA.  This was allowed
even though ERISA had historically prohibited participants from
bringing suit on their own behalf.  The decision concluded that
ERISA Sec. 502(a)(3) was intended to be a general &quot;catch-all&quot;
that would protect plan participants and beneficiaries, by allowing
participants to bring claims on their own behalf, as well as on
the behalf of the plan itself, in the case of an employer's alleged
misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty.
<P>
Now some employers fear that they could be more vulnerable to
litigation.  Although more suits may indeed be filed as a result
of the Supreme Court ruling, you may help protect your interests
through proper plan communication and documentation.
<P>
<I><B>Comprehensive written documents</B></I>
<BR>
All of your company's benefits plans should be in writing. The
company's right to make changes to the plan should be clearly
spelled out in plan documentation. 
<P>
<I><B>Oral communication</B></I>
<BR>
Any communication about the plan, written or oral, could be used
in litigation.  Therefore, consider limiting the number of approved
plan spokespersons and refrain from oral statements about the
plan as much as possible.  A centralized benefits plan department
can help control the flow of information and make it less likely
that inappropriate information is communicated.
<P>
With proper plan disclosure you may be able to limit your company's
risk.  Consult your financial or tax advisor to ensure that your
plan's documentation is appropriate. If you know his or her e-mail
address, <A HREF="mailto:">

<IMG SRC="gifs/dolpushes_head.gif" ALT="The DOL Pushes For Better Investment Education">
<BR> 

Workers are increasingly finding themselves responsible for the
investment management of their retirement savings.  The reason?
 The growing popularity of participant-directed individual account
retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans. An advantage of these
plans is that they remove the burden of investment allocation
from employers.  In return, workers hold ultimate control over
their accounts and are oftentimes given more flexibility in their
investment options.
<P>
Although such plans are generally viewed as positive, the 
<A HREF="http://www.dol.gov">U.S. Department of Labor 
(DOL)</A> has become concerned.  The DOL fears
that participants may not understand investment principles well
enough to make informed decisions that will ensure an adequate
retirement income.  In addition, the responsibility of choosing
investments may frighten workers who do not understand investment
principles, thus deterring them from plan participation.
<P>
To combat these drawbacks, many employers and plan sponsors have
provided workers with basic investment education programs.  Many
others, however, have held back.  They fear that their investment
education may be construed as offering &quot;investment advice&quot;
under section 3 (21) (A) (ii) of ERISA, which could give rise
to fiduciary status and potential liabilities.  
<P>
In an effort to promote better investment education by employers,
the DOL recently published <A HREF="http://www.benefitslink.com/erisaregs/96-1.html">
<I>Interpretive Bulletin 96-1</I></A>.
 The bulletin clarifies the differences between investment education
and investment advice. It also identifies four categories of investment
education, which are summarized below.
<P>
<I><B>1) Plan Information</B></I>
<BR>
Any materials that explain the operation of the plan, its investment
alternatives, the benefits of enrolling, the advantages of increasing
contributions and how preretirement withdrawals may lessen retirement
income.
<P>
<I><B>2) General Financial and Investment Information</B></I>
<BR>
Information that explains such topics as risk and return, diversification,
dollar cost averaging, compounded return, tax deferred investment,
effects of inflation, determining time horizons, and other similar
financial and investment concepts.
<P>
<I><B>3) Asset Allocation Models</B></I> 
<BR>
Materials that illustrate different portfolio asset allocations
based on various time horizons and risk profiles and are based
on generally accepted investment theories and principles.
<P>
<I><B>4)  Interactive Investment Materials</B></I> 
<BR>
Worksheets, software and similar materials, which provide a participant
the means to estimate future retirement income needs and assess
the impact of different asset allocations on retirement income.
<P>
Ongoing investment education can play a crucial role in helping
your workers understand what it takes to invest successfully.
 A better understanding by employees may also expand your plan's
participation and contribution rates.  As always, contact your
financial or legal advisor if you have questions about your company's
investment education programs.  If you know his or her e-mail
address, <A HREF="mailto:">send an e-mail now</A>.

 ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 5.75% for Kemper Asian Growth Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048),

<P>
Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

* Since fund's inception<BR>
# Portfolios are subject

sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 5.75% for Kemper Quantitative Equity Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. For Class C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% CDSC for shares redeemed within one year. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 4.50% for Kemper Diversified Income Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 4.50% for Kemper U.S. Mortgage Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject to

sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 2.75% for Kemper Intermediate Municipal Bond Fund. 
The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

<FONT SIZE=-1>*Based upon the fund's yield and the 37.1% federal income tax rate.
The SEC Yield for Class A, B and C shares would have been 3.66%, 2.98%
and 3.08%, respectively, if expenses were not being absorbed.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

# Portfolios are subject to change.<BR> 
## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 3.5% for Kemper Adjustable Rate U.S. Government Fund. The CDSC schedule 
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. 
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level. 
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are 
reduced or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<BR>

As you know, Kemper Funds believes that working with a financial representative is the best way to evaluate today's investment alternatives.

<P>

"Financial representative" is a catch-all term for the licensed professionals who represent others' financial interests. Investors today have their choice of where they meet their representative (at a brokerage office, at a financial institution or in their home, for example), the level of service (from full to limited) they want to receive, and how services will be compensated for. And, as markets become increasingly complex and global, an increasing number of financial representatives have continued with their education. 

<P>

Do you need help in deciphering your financial representative's business card? Despite the many possible affiliations and designations, almost every financial representative comes from one of four basic disciplines. Here's a quick portrait of each "type."

<P>

<B>The accountant</B><BR>
You expect a certified public accountant (CPA) to be able to advise you on audit, accounting and tax issues. To offer more encompassing help, including personal income tax planning, investment planning and estate planning, many CPAs also have sought accreditation from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as a Personal Financial Specialist (PFS). A PFS must have several hours of planning experience over a three-year period, pass a comprehensive exam and submit references. Reaccreditation is required every three years.

<P>

<B>The insurance agent</B><BR>
To be serving as a financial representative, an insurance agent can be expected to have a license to sell securities as well as insurance. Insurance agents' interest in the spectrum of personal financial management has led to the creation of a Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) designation. Accreditation requires coursework (in investments, income taxation and estate and financial planning), a minimum of three years of experience and adherence to a code of ethics. Chartered life underwriters (CLUs) qualify for a fast track to the ChFC, but the designation is not 
exclusive to the insurance industry. The American College, Bryn Mawr, Pa., awards the ChFC.  

<P>

<B>The financial planner</B><BR>
Financial planners represent a broad view, offering advice in investment planning (including mutual funds and individual securities), insurance, taxes, retirement, estate and investment planning. A certified financial planner (CFP) has completed extensive education, examination, experience and ethics requirements set by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Denver.  While almost half of all CFPs work for financial planning firms, they're also employed at securities, accounting and insurance firms and banks.

<P>

<B>The broker</B><BR>
Brokers are sales representatives who work for a brokerage firm, also known as a broker/dealer. They are registered with the National Association of Securities Dealers and have passed a qualifying examination. Because theyíre trained in securities laws, their expertise is in the selection and monitoring of stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other financial products. But while the generic "broker" gives you an idea of the representative's training, it does not satisfactorily describe the scope of his or her service. That's why many of those with a foundation in brokerage prefer 
to call themselves financial consultants or advisors. Many brokers also have 
additional designations, such as the CFP.

A financial representative can become your trusted partner for the
long-run. He or she will get to know you and work with you, to help you
reach a lifetime of financial goals.
<P>

<STRONG>Here's what you should expect from the start...</STRONG>
<P>

<STRONG>A detailed analysis of your financial situation.</STRONG> Your representative can
examine your current investments, income and tax situation, to analyze
your current level of "fiscal fitness."
<P>

<STRONG>A clear definition of your goals.</STRONG> Together, you and your financial
representative can formalize your goals - for the near-term (buy a new
house in a few years?), and for the long-run (college for children?
retirement?).
<P>

<STRONG>An individualized strategy to help reach your goals.</STRONG> Most likely, your
investment plan will include a combination of investments that address
your time and safety requirements. Your portfolio will be uniquely yours
- geared toward helping to meet your financial needs now, and later. 
<P>

<STRONG>Regular portfolio reviews.</STRONG>
You and your financial representative should periodically review your
investments to be sure you're on track to reaching your goals.
Similarly, you should talk with your representative throughout various
life stages. Marriage, new babies, retirement, aging parents, new jobs -
all of these might warrant a change in your investment strategy.
<P>

<STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>Do you really need a professional financial representative? </FONT SIZE=+1></STRONG>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Yes, if you agree with these statements....</FONT SIZE=+1>

my investments, and would rather leave the detailed analysis up to an
investment professional.

Your financial representative is a licensed professional, trained to
have an in-depth understanding of the financial markets. What's more, he
or she is expected to maintain the highest level of integrity and
respect in dealing with clients.
<P>

Entrusting your investments to an investment professional can actually
lift a weight off your shoulders. 
<P>

<STRONG>Why? Because your financial representative can...</STRONG>
<P>

<STRONG>Evaluate and help choose the best investments alternatives for you.</STRONG> Your
representative can pre-screen investment choices, and present you with
the ones that make the most sense for your situation. 
<P>

<STRONG>Help you manage risk.</STRONG> Investing to build capital always involves some degree of risk. A
financial representative can help you find the most comfortable
combination of risk and reward for you, based on your goals and
time-frame. Likewise, he or she can help you employ a variety of
risk-reduction strategies to help protect your investments.
<P>

<STRONG>Monitor the markets - and everything that impacts them.</STRONG> You won't have
to worry and watch the markets, because that's your representative's
full-time job. He or she will help keep your focus on long-term results
- and put short-term ups and downs in perspective. This can help reduce
losses due to "panic selling" - losses that result from selling
investments at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. 
<P>

<STRONG>Relieve you of administrative details.</STRONG> Your investment transactions can
go much more smoothly when handled by a professional financial
representative. In fact, he or she can take most of the time-consuming,
but necessary, paperwork off your hands. And, if you make all of your
investments through one representative, matters like address, telephone
number, and name changes can be handled with one phone call.
Furthermore, your representative can even help you organize and report
your investments' performance at tax-time.

Mutual fund investors who worked with a professional financial
representative have reaped greater rewards!
<P>

A well-chosen group of mutual funds can make an excellent cornerstone
for a results-oriented investment portfolio. And, studies have shown
that investors who use professional financial representatives - taking
advantage of their experience and guidance - have achieved better
results than investors who chose to go it alone.
<P>

<STRONG>See for yourself...</STRONG>
<P>

A study of 1,000 equity and fixed income mutual funds showed that
investors who bought funds through a professional financial
representative had better investment results than those who purchased
funds themselves - 15% better in equity funds and 9% better in fixed
income funds.* 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1> *Source: Dalbar, Inc. study "Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior"
(6/30/94). This information is historical and does not represent future
results. Also, there can be no guarantee that a particular investor's
results will be improved through professional advice. The study compared
cumulative investment returns over the period 12/31/92 to 12/30/94 for a
wide variety of equity and fixed income funds sold directly to investors
and sold through financial representatives. Performance information does
not consider the effect of sales charges paid by investors who worked
with financial representatives. Source of investment information was the
Investment Company Institute.</FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>

<STRONG>
Here's how your financial representative's experience and guidance can
help provide this exceptional benefit...</STRONG>
<P>

<STRONG>Encouragement to stay the course.</STRONG> A long-term perspective is one of the
best predictors of financial success. And, because studies have shown
that investors who worked with a professional financial representative
held their mutual fund investments longer than those who did not (3.2
vs. 2 years respectively for equity funds, and 2.9 vs. 1.7 years for
fixed income funds)** - they may have greater potential for success in
the long-run. 
<P>

<STRONG>Information about emerging opportunities.</STRONG> As an investment professional,
it's your financial representative's job to stay abreast of (and let you
know about) new investment opportunities. On the other hand, an investor
working alone would have to do lots of homework, including reading a
variety of financial publications and investment newsletters, to gain
timely awareness of such opportunities.
<P>

<STRONG>Advice when it's time to move.</STRONG> Should you move quickly to take advantage
of a new opportunity? Or should you stick with your current investments?
With a professional financial representative at your side, you can be
confident that you're making educated choices based on time-tested
experience. And that's the best feeling of all.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales
charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 4.50% for Kemper California Tax-Free Income Fund. 
The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.
<BR>
*Based upon the fund's yield and the 42.9% combined federal and
State of California income tax rate.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1> # Portfolios are subject
to change.<BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 4.50% for Kemper Michigan Tax-Free Income Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses. 
<BR>
*Based upon the fund's yield and the 39.9% combined Michigan and
federal income tax rate.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject
to change. <BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 4.50% for Kemper New York Tax-Free Income Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.
<BR>

*Based upon the fund's yield and the
44.3% combined federal and
state of New York and New York City income tax rate.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject to
change. <BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 4.50% for Kemper Pennsylvania Tax-Free Income Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

Of all the decisions you'll make about investing, this may be one of the biggest: Growth or Value?
<P>
When it comes to stock investing, there are two ways to take the bull by the horns, two well-known styles of equity management -- growth and value. Both offer a long-term, disciplined approach to capital appreciation, but the two styles go about their business in fundamentally different ways.
<P>
Growth or value? Is one style better than the other? It's an important decision, one that every investor should consider. And yet, many continue to seesaw between styles, an approach that too often misses the bull's-eye.

<B>Why Kemper Asian Growth Fund makes sense</B>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>Ability to invest in developing or emerging countries
<LI>Experienced management
<LI>Potential to increase returns
</UL>

<P>

Fund Objective: Long-term capital growth, by investing in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of equity securities of Asian companies.

<P>

<B>Ability to invest in developing or emerging countries</B><BR>
The fund invests primarily in Asian equity securities believed to have potential for capital growth. The fund invests primarily in developing or "emerging" economies.

<P>

For example:
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>China
<LI>Indonesia
<LI>Korea
<LI>Malaysia
<LI>Philippines
<LI>Thailand
<LI>Taiwan
</UL>

As a policy, the fund will invest in Japan only when economic conditions warrant and then only on a limited basis. However, the fund may invest without limit in developed countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore.

<P>

Portfolio Manager: Andrew Mason, director of Asian Equities. Prior to joining Zurich Kemper Investments, Mr. Mason was portfolio manager of the Asian and Japanese portfolios for a United Kingdom pension fund and has 14 years of international investment experience..

<P>

Kemper has been managing international equities since 1981---longer than 94% of the companies managing international equities.*<BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/nl_confirm_head.gif" ALT="News About Your Transaction Confirmation Statements">

<BR>

<BODY>
If you've recently made an account transaction or changed any
of the services or features on your account, you probably noticed
a few changes in your confirmation statement.  In late August,
we introduced the second phase of our project to consolidate your
transaction confirmation statements.  Now, when several changes
or transactions occur on your Kemper Funds accounts during the
same day, you'll receive one consolidated statement, instead of
separate statements for each individual transaction. 
<P>
For example, an exchange of shares from one fund to another would
previously prompt two statements:  one confirming a redemption
and one confirming a purchase.  Now, one statement confirms both
transactions.  
<P>
Another difference you'll notice is that your transaction confirmation
statement no longer shows any prior account transactions.  Previously,
your statement included your transactions year-to-date or the
last 18 transactions on your account, whichever was the smallest
number of transactions.  Now, you'll see only the transaction
that prompted the statement.  This change should help to eliminate
confusion by differentiating transaction confirmation statements
from quarterly account statements.    
<P>
&quot;We're very pleased to introduce this new phase in our consolidated
statement project,&quot;  says Ann Laughlin, first vice president
of Kemper Shareholder Marketing and Broker Communications.  &quot;By
simplifying the way in which we report transactions and consolidating
daily account activity onto one statement, we hope to eliminate
confusion<I> and</I> help to reduce fund expenses.&quot; 
<P>
Transaction confirmation statements now have the same look and
format as your quarterly statement.  No matter what type of statement
you receive from us, information such as the date of your statement,
your fund and account numbers and the tax identification number
on your account can always be found in the same place.  Transaction
confirmation statements will be consolidated in the same manner
as your quarterly statements:  All accounts with the same registration,
address and tax identification number will appear on one statement,
unless you have requested otherwise.

<IMG SRC="gifs/nl_hold_head.gif" ALT="Hold Period Reduced">

<BR>
<BODY>
Kemper Funds has reduced the 15 calendar day &quot;hold&quot;
policy on purchases made by check or ACH transfer.  The primary
purpose of such a hold period - a common restriction among mutual
funds and banks - is to protect you and the fund from fraud and
theft.  However, we found that the waiting period could be reduced
to 10 calendar days without compromising security.  Of course,
for most Kemper Funds, which are generally used as long-term investments,
a hold period is seldom a problem.  But short-term investors,
particularly those in Kemper Money Funds, may appreciate the
greater flexibility and liquidity of a shorter hold period.

<IMG SRC="gifs/nl_five_head.gif" ALT="Five Stars For Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund">

<BR>
<A HREF="../funds/smallcap.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A> was recently awarded Morningstar's
5-star &quot;highest&quot; rating for its overall performance
and performance over the three years ended July 31, 1996 in the
small company category.  For the one-year period, the fund's rating
is 4-stars, or &quot;above average.&quot;*  &quot;We're thrilled
to see this fund recognized for its outstanding performance,&quot;
says Jim Neel, president of Dreman Value Advisors, Inc.  &quot;It's
a proven winner that continues to offer an attractive opportunity
for long-term investors.&quot;  Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value
Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in small
capitalization stocks ($100 million to $1 billion) diversified
across at least 15 industries.
<P>
Earlier this year, the fund gained a new portfolio manager.  Steven
Stokes, a chartered financial analyst, joined Dreman Value Advisors,
Inc. as managing director.  In addition to his work on the Small
Cap Value Fund, he is portfolio manager for approximately $200
million in institutional assets.  Stokes stresses that Kemper-Dreman
Small Cap Value Fund's investment strategy and style remain unchanged.
 &quot;The philosophy takes precedence over personality,&quot;
he says.  &quot;We'll continue to pursue attractively priced stocks
with strong fundamentals - the strategy that has contributed to
the fund's strong performance since its inception in 1992.&quot;
 
<P>


<I>Returns are historical and do not reflect future performance.
 Returns and net asset values fluctuate.  Shares are redeemable
at net asset value, which may be more or less than original cost.</I>
<P>
<I>* Morningstar ratings range from five stars (highest) to
one star (lowest) and represent its assessment of the historical
risk level and total return of a fund relative to its class as
a weighted average for the three-, five- and 10-year periods.
 Ratings are not absolute or predictive of future performance.</I>
<P>
<I>Average annual total return measures net investment income
and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming
reinvestment of dividends and adjustment for the maximum applicable
sales charge of 5.75%.  Average annual total return reflects annualized
change.  Returns and rankings are historical and do not reflect
future performance.  Performance shown is for Class A shares.
 Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under certain conditions
as described in the fund's prospectus.  Performance of other classes
will vary from that shown because of differences in sales charges
and fees paid by shareholders investing in different classes.</I>
<P>
<I>Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. rankings are based upon
changes in net asset value with dividends reinvested and do not
include the effect of sales charges.  If they did, results may
have been less favorable.  Investment in small companies presents
greater risk than investment in larger, more established companies.</I>

you already have, please contact your financial representative,

<IMG SRC="gifs/nl_yrend_head.gif" ALT="We're Improving Your Year-end Statement">

<BR>
<BODY>
We're planning a number of enhancements for your 1996 year-end
account statement to provide a more comprehensive overview of
the performance of your Kemper Funds investments.  
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>If you have multiple accounts, the first part of your statement,
the portfolio summary, reports on your entire Kemper Funds portfolio.
 The summary will now include your initial investment amount*,
any subsequent purchases you've made, any amounts withdrawn and
the change in your account value as of December 31.  We'll also
include your investments' market value as of the beginning of
the statement period, allowing you to compare it to the current
market value.
<P>
<LI>Similar to the portfolio summary, for each of your accounts,
we will show your initial investment amount*, subsequent purchases
you've made, any amounts withdrawn and the change in your account
value as of December 31.
<P>
<LI>If you've held your account for two years or more, you'll
also receive a &quot;Personal Performance&quot; summary showing
the one-year total return on each of your accounts, as well as
their average annual total return since inception* and a graphic
illustration for each of your Kemper fund accounts.
<P>
<LI>The taxable income portion of your dividend summary will be
expanded to show ordinary income (which includes both your income
dividends and short-term capital gains) and long-term capital
gains.  
</UL>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=1>* For accounts established prior to December 31, 1989, the market value as of December 31, 1989, will be used in place of your initial investment amount and as a starting point for calculating your average annual total return.
<P>

For Kemper-Dreman accounts established after September 11, 1995, the market value as of September 11, 1995, will be used in place of your initial investment amount and as a starting point for calculating your average annual total return.
</FONT SIZE=1>
<P>

A detailed explanation of the enhanced year-end statement will
be in the next issue of <I>Kemper Fundamentals</I>.  You'll receive
it, along with your statement, in early January, 1997.

<IMG SRC = "gifs/p_adams_head.gif" ALT = "Meet The Newest Member Of Our Equity Investment Team">
<BR>
<B>Patrick S. Adams</B>, 35, in June was named portfolio manager of the $2.6 billion <A  HREF="../funds/growth.html">Kemper Growth Fund</A>, our flagship growth equity
mutual fund. Adams, who brings an impressive record as a growth
investment style manager, is the latest in a series of enhancements
to Kemper's equity investment team in the last year.
<P>
As part of an August 1995 acquisition, Kemper through its new
wholly owned subsidiary Dreman Value Advisors, Inc. (DVA) assumed
management responsibility for <A  HREF="../funds/high_return.html">Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund</A>,
<A  HREF="../funds/contrarian.html">Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund</A> and <A  HREF="../funds/smallcap.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value
Fund</A>.
<P>
With the acquisition of DVA came the value investing style of
David Dreman, who is generally considered the pioneer of a contrarian
investment strategy. Dreman is the chairman of DVA and manages
Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund.  Christian Bertelsen in March joined DVA as chief
investment officer and portfolio manager of Kemper-Dreman Contrarian
Fund. Bertelsen has an outstanding track record as an investment
manager and practitioner of the contrarian investment strategy.
<P>
Shortly after the DVA acquisition, Kemper hired veteran portfolio
manager Steven Reynolds to oversee and direct the company's equity
investment department. Reynolds served as interim manager for
Kemper Growth Fund until Adams joined Kemper in June.
<P>
In addition to assuming responsibility for the Kemper-Dreman Funds,
the company in the last year introduced four new equity funds:
<A  HREF="../funds/europe.html">Kemper Europe Fund</A>, <A  HREF="../funds/assetallocation.html">Kemper Horizon Fund</A>, <A  HREF="../funds/valuegrowth.html">Kemper Value+Growth
Fund</A> and <A  HREF="../funds/quantitative.html">Kemper Quantitative Equity Fund</A>.

<IMG SRC = "gifs/new_name_head.gif" ALT = "A New Name: Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.">
<BR>
In January, Kemper Financial Services, Inc. became an indirect subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Group. "The name is different," says Stephen B. Timbers, president, chief executive and chief investment officer, "but our fundamental mission is the same: To manufacture and distribute high quality investment management products and services to individuals and institutions and to help them achieve their long-term financial goals. Our goal is to fulfill this mission better than anyone else in the investment management business."
<P>


<IMG SRC="gifs/new_name1_subhead.gif" ALT="About the Parent Company">
<BR>
With nearly $70 billion in total assets at year-end 1994, the Zurich Insurance Group ranks among the largest international insurance organizations in the world. Zurich is a company with four core businesses, three of them insurance-related: property-casualty, life and reinsurance. The purchase of Kemper reflects its commitment to the fourth business - asset management - and to its goal to become a world leader in the global financial services market.<P>

Zurich is a public company, traded under the symbols ZURN (Telekurs) and ZURZn (Reuters) on the Swiss Stock Exchange. <P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/nl_deposit_head.gif" ALT="Direct Deposit Your Government Check">

<BR>

<BODY>

Why leave the delivery of your government check to chance?  By

filling out a single form, you can avoid those time-consuming

trips to the bank and rest assured that your check won't be stolen,

lost or delayed in the mail. If you receive a Social Security

check or other government payments on a regular basis, you've

probably been contacted in recent months about having your checks

deposited directly into your bank account

<P>

<B>A trend of the future</B>  

<P>

The U.S. Treasury Department this summer announced that

all Social Security recipients who apply for benefits after August

1, 1996, will have their checks automatically deposited into their

bank accounts whenever possible.  In addition, by 1999 all federal

payments, including salaries and other benefits such as those

paid to veterans, will be issued electronically.  Jim Hagedorn,

the Treasury Department's director of public affairs for the financial

management service, reports that converting to electronic payments

could save the government as much as $500 million over the next

five years and eliminate about 100,000 check thefts and forgeries

a year.

<P>

<B>Kemper Funds can help</B>

<P>

As an alternative to your bank account, consider having your government

checks deposited directly into your Kemper Money Funds account.

 Kemper Money Funds offer the opportunity to earn higher yields

<I>and</I> easy access to your money - as of September 5, 1996,

Kemper Money Market Fund's current 7-day yield was 5.04% while

the average bank money fund yield was 2.65%* - and many checking

accounts don't pay interest. Of

course, unlike bank products, no money fund is insured or guaranteed

by the U.S. government and there is no assurance that any fund

can maintain a $1.00 share value. Bank products offer fixed or variable 
rates and principal is fixed and may be insured. 

<P>

Once your government check is deposited into your Kemper Money

Fund, you can write an unlimited amount of checks (for $500 or

more) each month free, or use our EXPRESS-Transfer service to

transfer as little as $100 into your bank savings or checking

account.  You can also exchange a portion of the deposit to another

Kemper fund for long-term income or growth opportunities.  Plus,

you can make and verify account transactions 24-hours a day via

our automated phone service, KemperACCESS.  

<P>

Kemper's three money funds offer you these services and attractive

yields while maintaining a conservative investment philosophy

that emphasizes quality and consistency, not risk-taking.

<P>

To receive a Government Direct Deposit form, contact the government

agency that issues your checks.  Or, call Kemper Shareholder Services

at 1-800-621-1048.  Our representatives can provide the necessary

form (ask for Form 93) and answer your questions about Kemper

Money Funds' performance and services. 

<P>

* Yield shown is the average annualized net investment income

per share.  Past performance is historical and is no guarantee

of future results.  Yields will fluctuate.  Bank interest rate

shown is for the 100 leading banks and thrifts as of 9/5/96 according

to <I>Bank Rate Monitor</I>.

Q:  On a recent trip overseas, I was unable to reach Kemper Funds
Shareholder Services by using the general 800-number.  How can
I get information about my account or initiate a transaction when
I'm not in the U.S.?

A:  The easiest way to contact Kemper Funds when you're abroad
is through the Internet. Send an e-mail to info@kemper.com and
we'll respond with an e-mail within 24 hours.  For security reasons,
however, we ask that you don't send account-specific information
via e-mail.
<P>
If you need to reach us by telephone to initiate a transaction,
you can call us collect at 1-312-781-1121 Monday through Friday, between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.,
Central Standard Time.  For your convenience, we've added this
number to the contact information shown on the back of your account

<IMG SRC = "gifs/no_match_head.gif" ALT = "Why Published Investment Returns May Not Match Your Experience">
<BR>
How much did my investment return? That's usually the bottomline
for investors.But the actual annual return on your invested dollars may never
match the annual total returns that you read in the newspaper
or even in your fund's shareholder report. Remember that your
investment's progress will be the result of many factors.
<P>
We've prepared the following hypothetical illustration to explain
the difference between the published return and an individual's
actual experience. In each of the scenarios shown, the shareholders
had a total of $10,000 in the same hypothetical fund on the last
day of the one-year period from April 30, 1995, through April
30, 1996. Yet, the actual returns on their investments varied
significantly.
<P>
To produce the returns presented below, we've used Towers Data
Systems data based on the actual performance of the <A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">Standard &amp;
Poor's 500</A> over a recent one-year period (April 30, 1995, through
April 30, 1996). The S&amp;P 500 is an unmanaged index of common
stocks that is generally considered representative of the U.S.
stock market. Investments cannot be made directly in this index.
As you know, the stock market enjoyed a generally upward performance
during this one-year period. The high point of the period was
reached on February 12, 1996, and the low point reached on January
10, 1996. For this illustration, however, absolute performance
is not relevant, and we could have used any one-year period to
demonstrate how returns vary according to several factors.
<P>
<B>Hypothetical illustration</B>
<BR>
News item: XYZ Equity Fund today reported a total return of 30.14%
for the one-year period that ended April 30, 1996.
<BR>
The calculation of this return used the same assumptions that
your account statement, shareholder report and most published
listings use: That the full sum was invested on the first day
of the one-year period, that the shareholder did not add to or
subtract from the invested amount and that all income and capital
gain dividends were reinvested. The following illustrate how the
actual returns earned by various XYZ Equity Fund shareholders
might have been quite different from the published 30.14% return.

<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/no_match_table.gif" ALT="hypothetical examples">
<BR>

<FONT SIZE=1>
The above hypothetical examples are for illustrative purposes
only and are not intended to represent performance of any specific
investment, which may fluctuate.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/no_match_table2.gif" ALT="Income dividends + Capital gain dividends + Changes in the value of your fund's shares = Your fund's total return">
<P>

Today, the best measure of your investment progress is the portion
of your quarterly account statement that details the change in
the total value of your invested dollars. But Kemper Funds recognizes
that you need to evaluate your investment's long-term performance,
taking into consideration your individual account activity. Toward
that end, we are working on developing an account statement with
annual total return figures that reflect your activity. Watch
for more information in this section of Kemper.com on your Personal Performance.

<IMG SRC="gifs/reinvestment_subhead.gif" ALT="If you've redeemed a
Kemper mutual fund and you'd like to return, we'd love to have you
back.">
<BR>
By acting within six months of your redemption of your Class A Shares or
the equivalent, you can take advantage of Kemper's reinvestment
privilege, which allows you to reinvest all or a portion of your
redemption proceeds in the same Kemper fund or Class A Shares of another
Kemper fund without opening a new account or paying a new sales charge.
This privilege is not applicable to Class A Shares of Kemper Cash
Reserves Fund purchased directly at net asset value.
<P>

For Class B shareholders, the privilege enables you to reinvest all or a
portion of your redemption proceeds in the same fund or Class B Shares
of another fund - plus Kemper will reinvest the amount of contingent
deferred sales charge that was imposed upon the redemption proceeds
that you reinvest. If you reinvest, you will receive the original
purchase date on the reinvested shares. (The original purchase date is a
consideration when determining any future contingent deferred sales
charge. However, depending on your particular situation, this will not
be your purchase date for tax purposes. When calculating your holding
period for capital gains purposes, you will need to use your new
purchase date.)
<P>

Call Kemper Shareholder Services for a reinvestment certificate - or send us a
reinvestment check with a letter stating your intention to return - and
welcome back!

Your automated teller machine will ask you for one, your credit card
issuer will ask you for another and don't try to retrieve your voice
mail messages if you don't remember its code. You also need a Personal
Identification Number (PIN) in order to access Kemper's automated
telephone response system - your preassigned KemperACCESS PIN is the
last four digits of your Social Security number. 

<P>

Are you feeling overwhelmed by all the numbers and codes that today's
technologies are imposing on you? Remember that you can change your
KemperACCESS PIN at any time. Some shareholders prefer to adopt a
four-letter code (the letters correspond to numbers on the telephone keypad)
 that fits their personality and is therefore more memorable.

<P>

In order to change your PIN, just dial KemperACCESS (1-800-972-3060) and
follow its series of prompts. Of course, once you've changed your code,
be sure to keep it to yourself. 

<P>

KemperACCESS provides up-to-date Kemper fund and account information 24
hours a day, seven days a week. Your account balance, most recent
transactions, dividend earnings, current yields and returns and current
net asset values all are available from KemperACCESS. Selected account
transactions also are available.

<IMG SRC="gifs/tracking_head.gif" ALT="Tracking Your Kemper Fund
Investment">
<BR>

To keep an eye on the progress of your investment, you can turn to many sources
of information. Here's a quick review of what Kemper provides:
<P>

<UL>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Your quarterly statement.</B> You'll find your fund's year-to-date
total return through the end of the previous month and its average
annual
total returns as of the closing date of the previous quarter shown in
the fund summary of your quarterly statement. 
<P>

Total return and average annual total return are a measure of net
investment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments,
assuming that dividends are reinvested. While total returns are not
adjusted, average annual total returns are adjusted for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the
end of the period. Average annual total return reflects annualized
change while total return reflects aggregate change. 
<P>

Our goal is to mail your statement as close to the end of the quarter as
possible, which restricts our ability to print your fund's returns as of
the date of the close of that quarter. 
<P>
 
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B> KemperACCESS.</B> For up-to-date Kemper fund and account information 24
hours a day, seven days a week, call our automated telephone response
system. By calling 1-800-972-3060 on a touch-tone telephone, you can
receive the following information:
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Account balance <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Most recent transactions <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Dividend earnings <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Current yields and returns <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Current net asset values <BR>
<BR>

Selected account transactions also are available.
<P>

Are you a first-time caller? Don't be stumped when asked to enter your
Personal Identification Number (PIN) - your PIN is the last four digits
of your Social Security number. (You can change your PIN by following
KemperACCESS instructions.)
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B><I>Instant Profiles.</I></B> This quarterly publication presents performance
data about each fund in the Kemper family of funds. Asset size,
portfolio
composition and applicable duration and maturity information also are
reported. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Annual and semiannual shareholder reports.</B> A comprehensive report
of your fund's six-month performance is mailed to you twice a year. In it
you will find an economic overview from Kemper's chief investment
officer, a question-and-answer with the fund's portfolio manager and
detailed performance and financial data.
</UL>

<BR>

Reminder: Please remember that the performance of your individual
investment may differ from the total return reported by your fund. The
total return on your investment will depend on when you purchased your
shares, at what price and how you handle dividends and other
distributions. Your financial representative is the best source you can
turn to for help in reviewing your Kemper investment.

<BR>
When in doubt, diversify. Diversification - investment in a variety of
mutual funds, for example - is a time-tested way of reducing the risk
associated with the often unpredictable financial markets. 

<P>

As a shareholder in the Kemper family of funds, you have lots of
flexibility to diversify your holdings. Before taking any action,
however, be sure to consult with your financial representative. (If you know your representative's e-mail address, <A HREF="mailto:">click here</A> to send him or her an e-mail now.)

<P>

These shareholder privileges support diversification:

<P>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>You can exchange funds. You can move all or a portion of your shares
from one Kemper fund to another fund within the same class of shares
without incurring additional sales charges (except as noted below). 

<P>

Fund exchanges are subject to the following conditions - and please
note that Kemper's exchange privilege may be modified, suspended or
terminated at any time.
	
	<P>
	
<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
	<LI>If you exchange shares into a Kemper fund in which you do not
	currently have an open account, the minimum exchange is $1,000.	
	
	<P>
	
	<LI>Shares purchased by check or ACH transaction 
	may be exchanged after they have been owned for at least 15 days.
	Once shares are exchanged, they must remain in the fund for a minimum
	of 15 days before they can be exchanged again. This latter rule does not
	apply to Kemper Money Funds or Kemper Cash Reserves Fund.
	
	<P>
	
	<LI>Your exchange from shares of Kemper Money Funds into any	
	other Kemper mutual fund will be subject to an applicable sales
	charge. However, exchanges of shares that you acquired through
	reinvesting your dividends are not subject to any sales charge upon
	exchange. To find out the amount of your Kemper Money Funds
	investment attributable to reinvested dividends, call Shareholder
	Services.
	
	<P>
	
	<LI>Fund exchanges are taxable transactions. The Internal Revenue
	Service considers an exchange to be the redemption of shares of
	one fund (a sale) and a new investment (a purchase) into another
	fund.

</UL>

<BR>

<LI>You can arrange to exchange an amount systematically from one fund
into another fund* each month. In order to exercise the 
<A HREF="../shareholders/forms.html">
Systematic
Exchange Privilege,</A> the accounts you are exchanging to and from must
each have a value of at least $1,000. There is a $100 minimum that can
be automatically exchanged each month.

<P>

<LI>You can arrange to have dividends from one fund automatically invested
into shares of another Kemper fund*. You must have a minimum balance of
$1,000 in the account from which you are moving dividends and $1,000 in
the account into which you are investing the dividends. Shares purchased
by reinvested dividends are always bought at net asset value - you do
not pay a sales charge.

<P>

<LI>You can arrange to have a certain amount (a minimum of $50 each month)
invested into a Kemper fund account each month**. Call Shareholder
Services to learn more about Kemper's three automatic investment plans
(<A HREF="../shareholders/forms.html">Bank Direct Deposit, Payroll Direct Deposit and Government Direct
Deposit</A>). An automatic investment plan does not guarantee a profit or
protect against a loss in a declining market.

<P>

</UL>
 
*<EM> This privilege is not available to Kemper Retirement Fund Series and
Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund shareholders.</EM>
<BR>
** <EM>Investment may be subject to a sales charge. Please consult your fund
prospectus for additional information.</EM>

<P>

An investment in Kemper Money Funds is neither insured nor
guaranteed by the U.S. government. There can be no assurance that the
funds will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per
share.

<P>

<EM>To obtain a Kemper Funds prospectus in addition to those you
already have, please call Shareholder Services or 
<A HREF="../prospectus.html">request one now.</A> 
The prospectus contains
more complete information including management fees and expenses. Please
read it carefully before you invest or send money.</EM>

<IMG SRC="gifs/certificates_head.gif" ALT="Your Reinvestment Privilege">
<BR>
<IMG SRC="gifs/certificates_subhead.gif" ALT="Do you have share
certificates for your fund investment?">
<BR>
Your privileges as a Kemper Funds shareholder are designed to give you
maximum flexibility to adjust your investment portfolio as the general
market conditions or your individual investment objectives change. But
if you have share certificates for your funds, you should know
that your flexibility to move your shares is limited. 

<P>

The traditional purpose of share certificates - which was to provide
proof of ownership - has been rendered almost obsolete. Today, the
securities industry has the capability to settle trades and maintain
investors' positions electronically. The existence of the paper
documents and your possession of them, though, can keep you from taking
full advantage of your privileges.

<P>

Some examples: You cannot redeem shares by telephone or wire transfer or
use the telephone exchange privilege if share certificates have been
issued. The systematic exchange and the systematic withdrawal plan are
two privileges that cannot be established for fund accounts whose shares
are held in certificate form. If you want to exchange shares that you
hold in certificate form, you must first return them to Kemper.

<P>

Considering these limitations and the risks involved if a certificate is
lost or destroyed - a bond worth 2% or more of the certificate value is
normally required to replace the certificate, Kemper strongly recommends
that you not request your shares in certificate form and that you return
any certificates you may have.

<P>

Please return your certificates <EM>by registered mail</EM> to the
following
address:

<P>

<DL><DD>
Kemper Service Company
<BR>
Special Functions Department
<BR>
811 Main Street
<BR>
Kansas City, MO 64105
</DL>
<P>

Please do not endorse your certificates or sign them in any way. Once we
receive them, you will be notified that your certificated shares have been 
deposited in your account.

Are you getting married in the morning? Or is there any other pending
event - the coming of age of a minor on a custodial account, the
addition of a companion as a joint tenant, the death of a joint tenant -
that will affect the ownership of your mutual fund account?

<P>

Any change in the ownership of your Kemper Funds account requires transferring the
shares to a new Kemper account. And, for security reasons, not all
privileges from your original account can be transferred. However, you
can easily establish privileges on your new account by completing a
Kemper Account Privileges Form, which can be requested from Shareholder
Services.

<P>

While visiting Kemper.com, you can go to <A HREF="forms.html">
Printable Forms</A> and print one or more forms that enable you to 
establish individual privileges. Just complete, sign and return 
to Kemper at the address shown on the form.

Many long-time banking relationships have been ended lately as bank
customers react negatively to increased service charges or service
changes as a result of changes in bank ownership.

<P>

If you've recently switched banks, please remember to notify Kemper if
you take advantage of any shareholder privileges that involve transfers
to or from your bank account. 

<P>

These are the specific instances when your Kemper mutual fund account
records need to be updated when you change banks:

<P>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>If you've signed up for the wire redemption privilege, which enables
you to sell all or a portion of your shares and have the proceeds wired
from your fund account to your bank account.

<P>

<LI>If you automatically invest a certain amount each month from your
checking or savings account.	

<P>

<LI>If you've signed up for the EXPRESS-Transfer privilege, which enables
you to use electronic funds transfer to move money between your bank,
savings institution or credit union and a Kemper account.

<P>

<LI>If you've arranged to have your dividends automatically deposited into
your bank account.

<P>

<LI>If you systematically withdraw a certain amount from your Kemper
mutual fund account and have it deposited into your bank account.

</UL>
<BR>

Shareholder Services will be happy to send you the appropriate form that
you'll need to complete in order to supply us with your new bank account
information.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When assessing the return of your mutual fund investment, you should
consider it in context of the markets in which the fund strives to
perform.
<P>

The most widely quoted measure of the performance of the financial
markets is the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Unfortunately, "the Dow"
may provide very little insight on how your mutual fund investment is
progressing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a group of 30 blue chip
industrial stocks. 
<P>

More useful to you will be the performance of the particular index - an
unmanaged group of similar investments - that your mutual fund uses as
a benchmark for its investment objective. 
<P>

Comparing your fund against its index can be enlightening. Note, though,
that a fund's return will depend upon its specific investments. To
understand why your fund outperformed or underperformed its index, it
may also be helpful to compare the composition of your fund's portfolio
with the composition of the index over the same period of time.
Significant performance differences may arise if your fund and the index
were invested in different companies and industries throughout the
period. Other factors, such as cash flows in and out of a fund and fees
and expenses, may affect the relationship between fund performance and
the index.
<P>

<STRONG>Which broad market index would you like to compare your fund's 
performance against?</STRONG> (The graph will present the comparative
total returns for Class A shares of your fund for the last 10 years 
and year-to-date, through the most recent quarter end, unadjusted for 
a <A HREF="salescharges.html">sales charge</A>. Multiple classes not 
available for Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund and Kemper Retirement Fund;
fund performance shown.)

<IMG SRC="howmarkets/gifs/howmarkets_head.gif" ALT="How The Markets React">
<BR>
8:30 A.M. EASTERN STANDARD TIME, THE FIRST FRIDAY OF EVERY MONTH: The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a division of the Labor Department, releases an <A HREF="ftp://STATS.bls.gov/pub/news.release/empsit.txt">employment situation report</A> that regularly influences the behavior of both the bond and equity markets in which mutual funds invest.
<P>
Using the data included in the report -- the unemployment rate, the size of nonfarm payrolls, average workweek and hourly earnings -- investors, economists and others make additional estimates about other aspects of the economy for which data are not yet available. These computations take place almost instantaneously and, within 15 minutes of the release of the report, the bond markets react to what the "news" is saying abut the economy.  By the time the stock markets open, within the hour, equity investors' reaction also will be apparent.
<P>
With the help of Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. Chief Economist John Silvia, we've prepared a quick review of how information can be derived from the employment conditions report. 
<P>
December 6, 1996: THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION FOR NOVEMBER 1996<BR>
<I>For more information about any one of these economic measures, just click on the gear or read below.</I>


<P>

<IMG WIDTH=435 HEIGHT=300 BORDER=0 SRC="howmarkets/gifs/howmarkets_anim.gif" USEMAP="#howmarketsreact.map">
<P>

<B>Unemployment rate</B><BR>
Economists believe that the unemployment rate associated with "full employment" is 6 percent -- when fewer than 6 percent of the population is unemployed, wages tend to rise as employers bid for scarce labor.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 5.4%<BR>Change: +0.2</B>
<P>

<B>The number of people employed</B><BR>
The number of people employed is a measure of the economy's strength.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 120 million<BR>Change: +118,000</B>
<P>

<B>Consumer confidence</B> <I>(measured by the University of Michigan index)</I><BR>
Confidence tends to rise and fall with employment news.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 98.9<BR>Change: +2.4%</B>
<P>

<B>Where people are employed</B><BR>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>Manufacturing<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 18.2 million<BR>Change: +9,000</B>
<LI>Construction<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 5.4 million<BR>Change: +14,000</B>
<LI>Services<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 96.0 million<BR>Change: +96,000</B>
<LI>Government<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 19.5 million<BR>Change: -22,000</B>
</UL>
Detail on the sectors that are hiring is especially important to the stock markets.
 
<P>
<B>Tax revenue</B><BR>
The employment level will affect the amount of revenue to be generated by income taxes.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: $918 billion<BR>Change: +0.6%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Hours worked</B><BR>
An increase in the average hours worked in a week can indicate a business upturn -- employers usually extend the number of hours their current employees work as a prelude to hiring more.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 34.5 / week<BR>Change: +0.2%</B>
<P>

<B>Industrial production</B> <I>(measured by an index)</I><BR>
Actual production figures are available later in the month, but early insights can be gained by reviewing the number of hours worked in the manufacturing sector.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 1.23<BR>Change: +0.4%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Capacity utilization</B><BR>
This rate, the subject of its own report later in the month, seeks to measure the operating capacity of factories. At full capacity -- generally believed to be around 82 percent -- inflation has historically tended to rise.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 83.4%<BR>Change: +0.2%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>How much workers are paid</B><BR>
With the total number of workers known, the next logical question is "How much are they being paid?" -- and do these hourly earnings represent an increase or a decrease?<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: $413.66 / week<BR>Change: +$5.49</B>
<P>

<B>Personal income</B><BR>
The level of earnings will determine the amount that people have to spend on necessities and luxuries.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: $6.6 trillion<BR>Change: +0.4%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Consumer spending</B><BR>
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the United States' gross domestic product (GDP). Once employment totals are known, market observers can make some educated guesses about income and consumption.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: $5.6 trillion<BR>Change: +0.5%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Retail sales</B><BR>
Strong retail sales, including auto sales, can contribute to corporate profits, which pleases stock market investors. Bond market investors worry that strong sales can lead to an inflationary economy.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: $214 billion<BR>Change: +0.4%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Housing starts</B><BR>
When growth is anticipated, builders make more plans. Economic weakness or higher interest rates discourage building plans.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 1.46 million<BR>Change: -2.0%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Gross domestic product (GDP)</B><BR>
Market observers track the change in gross domestic product (GDP) -- the dollar value of all goods and services produced in the United States -- as a measure of how fast the economy is growing. The Federal Reserve Board says it considers 2.5 percent to 3 percent an acceptable, noninflationary growth rate. Official GDP numbers are released and revised continually, but the employment conditions report makes it possible to do a quick calculation: Multiplying the number of people working X the average hours worked has produced a rough GDP that has historically been quite close to the GDP data released weeks and months later.<BR>
<B>September 1996 level: $6.9 trillion<BR>Change: +2.0% 3rd quarter</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Federal Reserve Board policy</B><BR>
Based on the rough GDP and inflation data that's derived, the Federal Reserve Board will not raise rates.
<P>

<B>Bond markets</B><BR>		
Because the value of fixed-income investments can be jeopardized by inflation, bond markets will be mixed in their reaction to signs of a slowing economy and rising inflation.<BR>
<B>Silvia's analysis of the December 6, 1996, report: Bond rates will stay fairly steady in a narrow trading range.</B>
<P>

<B>Stock markets</B><BR>
Equity investors are encouraged by news that can support corporate profits. But while they favor a healthy economy, they, too, worry about inflation's potential to erode value.<BR>
<B>Silvia's analysis of the December 6, 1996, report: The report of large wage increases along with slower but still positive growth suggests a more cautious outlook on profits.</B>
<P>

<B>Interest rates</B><BR>
The current short-term federal funds rate is 5.26%.

<IMG SRC = "gifs/inflation_tamed_head.gif" ALT = "Inflation: Tamed!">
<BR>
Is it true? Can it be possible that inflation - the beast that once intimidated us all - has been tamed? Citing persistently low levels of inflation even during recent strong economic growth, many economists including Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. Chief Economist John Silvia believe that the Federal Reserve Board has largely succeeded in controlling inflation. If it's true that the lion will roar no more (or at least for the foreseeable future), there may be some issues that you need to rethink.
<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/inflation_tamed1_subhead.gif" ALT = "Putting puny into perspective...">
<BR>
At its highest in the last 45 years, consumer price inflation was 14.6 percent in March 1980. You would have needed almost 15 percent just to have forward motion in either the return on your investments or in a salary increase. Now, with inflation averaging about 3.5 percent in the last five years, you don't need double-digits to make the kind of progress that you did during high inflation periods. True, the numbers are punier, but low inflation may mean that you can keep more of what you earn.
<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/inflation_tamed2_subhead.gif" ALT = "A house is a home...">
<BR>
And that may be just about it. Residential real estate's ability to keep up with what was then the high rate of inflation in the 1970s and 1980s provided many homeowners with a nest egg they could live in. But the absence of inflation in today's environment begs the question: If housing keeps pace with inflation and inflation has been de-fanged to about 3 percent, how will tomorrow's nest eggs be built? According to Silvia, many Americans are substituting financial assets for real estate assets as their prime way of building net worth. Rather than being counseled to stretch themselves to buy a home today, younger Americans are now being urged to invest. 
<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/inflation_tamed3_subhead.gif" ALT = "Consume if you must...">
<BR>
But savvy shoppers are learning to postpone their buying as long as they can. That's a departure from the 1970s and 1980s when Americans bought as soon as they could rather than run the risk of paying higher prices later. Silvia says the low inflation environment has made it possible for discounters like Wal-Mart and Home Depot to exist. "You have to have stable prices in order for someone to come in and make a business out of discounting those prices," he says.
<P>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/inflation_tamed4_subhead.gif" ALT = "But never a borrower be...">
<BR>
Borrowing makes some sense when you can borrow today and pay your creditor with dollars that will be worth less tomorrow. That's not true in 1996, especially if your borrowing takes the form of charging to a 19.8 percent credit card account at a time when inflation is averaging 3 percent. You're providing your lender with a very high, very real return of approximately 16.8 percent. 
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG SRC = "gifs/inflation_tamed5_subhead.gif" ALT = "The Risk Persists">
<BR>
While it may seem to be under control for now, inflation continues to represent a risk for investors. Even if the U.S. economy continued in its current 3 percent inflation bliss for the next 20 years, the purchasing power of $1 would be reduced to 55 cents by 2016. That's why investment experts continue to recommend investments that have historically outpaced inflation.

<P>

Psychology is a key consideration to financial market and economic
analysis. In fact, psychology is a required course for undergraduate
students in economics. Consumer purchases of homes and autos rise when
households feel good about their jobs and their future. In contrast,
when consumers are uncertain, auto and home sales weaken. Psychology is
also key to business spending. Survey results on business optimism show
that firms buy more equipment and hire more workers when their
confidence is fairly high that the economy will continue to grow.
<P>

One psychological indicator, the monthly University of Michigan's
Consumer Sentiment Index, is considered a leading indicator of the
direction of the economy. When the consumer is reported to be
"cautious," for example, the economy may be headed for a slowdown. For
business sentiment, surveys by organizations such as the Conference
Board offer a reliable view of hiring plans and capital spending
intentions.
<P>

Consumer psychology, however, can be tricky. Purchasing in the United
States does not rise and fall solely with the spirits of the American
consumers. Because Americans are conditioned to watch for sales, buying
activity can often be skewed by price. 
<P>

As an example, let's consider the advertising and promotion techniques
used by auto manufacturers. For years, the U.S. auto industry sold autos
by offering rebates. What happened? Consumers caught on quickly and
started to insist on rebates before they would buy. Auto companies were
then forced to use more frequent rebates and broaden the availability of
autos sold with rebates. 
<P>

Today, the U.S. economy has a similar problem. For several years now,
the inflation rate has fallen steadily. Consumers have come to expect
it. As a result, housing markets have become dependent on prospective
home buyers waiting for a decline in mortgage rates. Across the board,
consumers will tend to postpone purchases because they expect inflation
to fall, not rise. Sales of consumer durables such as furniture, carpets
and even autos all have seen the impact of this changed consumer
psychology. How different this is from the buy-now (before prices rise
again) psychology of the 1970s!
<P>

But consumers cannot help but react to economic news. In the second half of 1995, the economy slowed down. Employment growth, in
particular, fell off. Seeing this, consumers became less confident about
their jobs - which, in turn, set off a chain reaction. Reduced
confidence in job security prompted some consumers to reduce spending.
Business optimism also turned cautious as economic weakness in Mexico
and the consumer spending slowdown reduced profit and sales
expectations. Job security, not wages, became a key focus of households.
<P>

As the country moves through this stage of the economic cycle, another
factor is influencing consumer psychology today. Consumer expectations
toward retirement also have changed, as most Americans expect that they
will have to provide more and more of their own retirement income. Less
financial support will come via Social Security benefits. To be prepared, U.S. households
have started to raise their savings rates in recent years. This change
has shifted consumer budgets toward more investment in financial assets
(for example: mutual funds, equities, bank deposits, life insurance) and
less spending on real assets (consumer goods).
<P>

Where consumer confidence goes from here depends upon employment
prospects and interest rate trends. For as long as employment growth is
positive, consumer psychology will probably remain positive but
cautious. Positive consumer sentiment should suggest continued economic
growth. The pace of growth, however, is likely to reflect Americans'
new-found caution on job security.

<IMG SRC="gifs/gamefedfund_head.gif" ALT="The Game Of Federal Funding">
<BR>

In a roundabout way, when you invest in a U.S. government mutual fund,
you participate in funding the operations of the U.S. government.
Securities that government mutual funds invest in include securities
issued by the U.S. Treasury, its agencies and instrumentalities. 
<P>

"Think of the federal government as a corporation, and the U.S. Treasury
as the corporation's treasurer," says Kemper Portfolio Strategist Rob
Schumacher. "The government has business to do (projects to spend money
on such as defense, social programs and so on) and the treasurer is in
charge of making sure that the necessary resources are available."
<P>

How much money does the country need to run? In 1996, the budget
proposal is for $1.6 trillion. Payroll and corporate taxes provide some
of
what's needed. But because the country's spending has exceeded its
revenue
every year since 1969, the government borrows heavily to pay for all of
what it wants to do. In fact, the U.S. government securities market is
the largest securities market in the world. In a typical week (we'll use
the week starting February 5, 1996 as an example), the U.S. Treasury
will
borrow more than $19 billion to meet its maturing obligations and
projected cash needs.
<P>

Although opinions differ about the appropriateness of Uncle Sam's
spending habits, its system for raising funds is impressive. (As
Schumacher says, "When you owe people several trillion dollars, you have
to have a very efficient method of making sure that you can meet your
obligations.")
<P>

Unlike what other borrowers might encounter, the government has no
problem raising funds because the securities the U.S. Treasury issues
are direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury - they're backed by the
"full faith and credit" of the United States. Mutual funds, institutions
and individuals are among the groups willing to invest in these
securities. (Of course, mutual fund shares are not guaranteed.)
<P>

In order to meet its financing requirements (which include making
interest payments due on its debt), the Treasury auctions securities of
varying maturities. Most of the funds are borrowed for a short time, and
13-week and
26-week Treasury bills are auctioned every week. Treasuries of longer
maturities are auctioned less frequently.
<P>

Perhaps the greatest variable in the process is the price that the
government will have to pay for funds it borrows. This "price" is
influenced by interest rates as set by the Federal Reserve Board and the
open market. 
<P>

And, Schumacher says, it's in the monitoring of interest rates where the
professional management of a government income mutual fund can provide
value to fund shareholders. "What are interest rates going to do? What
maturity Treasury securities should the fund be investing in for maximum
performance?" According to Schumacher, "These are the questions the
professional manager deals with every day."

<P>

Interest rates come in several different sizes: short, intermediate and
long. They also have different "flavors": the rates that are available
on U.S. Treasury, corporate and municipal securities. Finally, rates
reflect the push and pull of different forces: growth, inflation,
deficits and currency fluctuations.
<P>

The behavior of interest rates is of more than academic interest.
Investors in money market funds and fixed-income funds, for example, own
different types of securities with different maturities. Whether short-
and long-term interest rates move together or apart will determine the
relative performance of these funds.
<P>

First, let's take a look at the various sizes of interest rates.
Short-term rates refer to rates on instruments such as bank loans or
U.S. Treasury bills that are fewer than two years in maturity. Rates on
instruments between two and seven years in maturity are considered
intermediate term; long-term rates are those paid on instruments that
are seven or more years to maturity. Securities with a longer time
exposure have a greater possibility of inflation, recession or default. 
<P>

Interest rates also vary by the flavor of the security. Because they are
often tax-exempt, municipal securities (which are issued by state and
local governments and agencies) tend to offer lower interest rates than
government or corporate securities. Corporate securities are considered
more risky than governments and therefore interest rates on corporates
tend to be higher than those on governments.
<P>

In 1994, a fascinating year for watching interest rates, we saw a divergence in the performance of both different size
and flavor interest rates. Short rates such as the prime rate charged on
bank loans responded as the Federal Reserve Board steadily increased the
rates it charged on the overnight lending of reserves. When the Federal
Reserve raises the rates it charges banks, that affects the returns an
investor can expect on securities.
<P>

Long rates rose along with short rates as long-term (bond) investors
believed that the Fed was raising short rates in response to
expectations of stronger growth and higher inflation. But while short
and intermediate rates tend to be driven by Fed policy, long rates react
to an array of investor expectations - expectations of currency
stability and fiscal deficits as well as of economic growth and
inflation. 
<P>

The difference in factors that determine rates was clearly evident by
the fourth quarter of 1994. The Fed was still raising short rates. But,
by then, long rates had stabilized and even started to decline. Why? The
market expectations that influence long rates had changed. Financial
markets started to expect that economic growth would slow and inflation
would not rise. Short rates, on the other hand, continued to react to
the Fed's actions.
<P>

Interest rate flavors acted differently as well. Rates on corporate
securities, in particular, did not rise as much Treasuries. Corporate
credit quality was expected to improve as the economy looked stronger
and therefore the traditional difference between what an investor might
earn on a corporate versus a Treasury security narrowed even as interest
rates, in general, rose. Municipal rates, meanwhile, reflected the
relative supply/demand of their own market more than the overall shift
of economic expectations.

<P>


The daily news is filled with economic reports that could conceivably
affect the value of your investments. What should keep you up at night
and what can you afford to ignore? We'll attempt to turn the lights on
some of the risks that could threaten your sleep.
<P>

Risks are inherent in all our activities. As individuals and as
investors, we must understand those risks particularly as they apply to
an economic forecast. At Kemper, our outlook is for steady economic
growth without a rapid rise in inflation. 
<P>

But what are the risks associated with this forecast? How can we
recognize the risks? If risks become realities, what are we likely to
see? Three risks to our forecast are associated with inflation
expectations, the dollar and consumer confidence.
<P>

Inflation expectations are a key factor influencing the trend in
long-term interest rates. Recent data suggest that Americans expect
inflation to rise at a rate of three percent or so. The risk is that
inflation could rise by more than that. 
<P>

You've probably heard or read the news that prices on commodities,
particularly those used in the production of goods for consumers and
businesses, have risen recently. Prices paid and prices received by
purchasing managers have been higher in recent months. Energy prices are
also up. 
<P>

If these commodity prices are perceived as becoming widespread or begin
to filter into consumer products, then inflation expectations may rise.
Investors can be expected to start to factor higher inflation into their
pricing and they'll require higher interest rates to compensate for the
risk of such higher inflation. If that happens, interest rates could
rise higher than our forecast expects and this could reduce economic
growth more than expected.
<P>

Another recent economic newsmaker has been the value of the U.S. dollar.
For some time, financial markets were concerned about the dollar's
depreciation against the Japanese yen. 
<P>

Dollar fluctuations are normal. Each year the dollar appreciates against
some currencies while it depreciates against other currencies. 
<P>

What happens if the dollar continues to depreciate against the same
currency? This depreciation would tend to discourage
foreign investors from buying U.S. securities - particularly U.S.
Treasury bonds. When foreigners think the dollar is weak, they expect to
be compensated with higher interest rates. When higher rates have to be
paid and the U.S. Treasury's cost of borrowing rises, interest rates
rise across the board. This hinders both U.S. economic growth and investment
performance.
<P>

Consumer confidence is a third risk. From 1991 through mid-1994, consumer
confidence rose in an environment of improving job growth and lower
interest rates. 
<P>

Spending by consumers represents approximately two-thirds of total
spending in the economy - so you can see that consumer confidence is
important. But when interest rates are rising and job growth is slowing,
there is a risk that consumer confidence will falter. A decline in
consumer confidence, then, has the result of slowing growth further.
<P>

Over the next year, these three risks - inflation, the dollar and
consumer confidence - do not appear sufficiently high to threaten
continued economic growth. Consider them benign boogiemen. 
<P>

But the threat they represent can change over time and, of course,
non-economic risks (such as politics and war) can make them even
scarier. Because the risk profile of the economy for 1996 remains low
and the probability of continued economic growth high, we think that now
is a good time for you to get your sleep.

<P>

Concerns about the availability and financing of health care in the future are the 
primary focus of government and household planning today. For investors, the 
health care debate provides added emphasis to the need for retirement planning 
and the need for investment vehicles to provide for health care expenditures 
associated with retirement funding. 
<P>

Let's review the two different sets of pressures that are forcing today's debate on the 
future of health care.
<P>

Budget deficit reduction at the federal government level is the first pressure. The 
task of reducing federal deficits to somewhere close to balanced over the next seven 
years requires the government to slow down the growth of its spending on health 
care. Programs such as Medicare will still grow but the rate of growth 
must be reduced.  Although the elderly will be responsible for paying higher 
Medicare premiums, their responsibility will equal less than one-third of their 
Medicare bill, with the other two-thirds of the bill continuing to be paid for by taxpayers. 
<P>

Reducing the pace of federal spending on health care, then, means that more of the 
burden of retirees' health care must be borne by retirees themselves. Higher co-payments and alternative ways of delivering health care are among the solutions to 
be considered.
<P>

Demographics are the second pressure forcing the debate. The baby boom will soon 
start its inevitable march into retirement, and this will balloon the demand for 
Medicare services. Certainly the federal taxpayer cannot support the baby boom at 
the same level of retiree health benefits as is being done for the current generation 
of retirees. Future retirees will have to provide more for their own health care. 
<P>

The United States is not alone in insisting on this. The retirement financing burden 
has already forced change in pension programs in Germany and Sweden. As in other 
countries, the political transition can be expected to meet resistance, however. The 
elderly, a strong voting bloc in the U.S., will continue to fight for the preservation of 
retiree benefits, and there are many politicians who are willing to play along in the 
interest of gathering votes. 
<P>

How will health care be funded? Retirement planning has been developed to meet 
funding needs. As a result of federal deficit reduction, the present Baby Boomers 
and Generation Xers need to increase the amount they invest from their current 
income to provide for a retirement that assumes a greater responsibility for their 
health care costs.
<P>

Knowing that their retirement has to provide for everyday living and health care 
expenses, will workers today try to set aside incrementally more for the future? Yes, 
at least that's my expectation. Proposals for expanded Individual Retirement 
Account (IRA) and 401(k) programs also reflect this thinking. The rational 
individual, if he or she wants to enjoy the retirement standard of living that others 
enjoyed before cuts in federal benefits, would be expected to increase investment 
now.  Private funding by individuals must make up the shortfall in public funding for retirement.
<P>

Without increased private funding, the quality of the retirement experience will 
indeed diminish for future retirees. Present retirees benefited from an unusual 
coincidence of generous government benefits, demographics and unexpected 
health care improvements. Future generations will not likely benefit from at least the 
first two. However, we are starting to see some innovations designed with 
tomorrow's retiree in mind.  Through the development of new payment systems and 
pricing policies, health care providers such as hospitals, insurers and doctors also 
have started to alter their means of helping patients finance their health care.

<P>
Mobility is a characteristic of American life.  We love our cars.  We "go away" to college.   We change homes and careers several times in our lives.  However, it is income and class mobility that truly differentiates the American way of life from the rest of the globe.  America was settled by people from all lands who sought a "better life" for their subsequent generations relative to the life that was possible in the "old country."  Our parents ingrained in us that we could "do better."
<P>
Official U.S. Treasury data* illustrate the income mobility of Americans.  A recent study divided households into five groups (quintiles).  One conclusion from the study: In the three lowest quintiles, one-third or fewer of the taxpayers in the quintile at the beginning of the sample period were in the same quintile at the end of the sample period just nine years later. Two out of three taxpayers had improved their earnings sufficiently to move out of the bottom earning quintile.
<P>
Income mobility can be dramatic.  More taxpayers in the bottom quintile moved to the top quintile over the nine-year period than stayed in the bottom quintile. Only 14 percent of households in the lowest quintile at the start of this study remained in the lowest quintile 9 years later at the end of the study.  One quarter (25 percent) entered the middle class (the third percentile). That's in just nine years!  Think about the mobility between generations!  

<P>

What's the explanation for this mobility?  Education and freedom, two aspects of American life that we take for granted, are really quite unique in the world and are key to mobility.  Rigid social societies, such as Mexico or Iran, have seen violent revolutions as a consequence of angry people who felt trapped in their position. In the United States, access to high school education and the many levels of college education offer people of all ages the opportunity to gather skills necessary for a better job (i.e., income mobility).  

<P>

Freedom allows people, once they have skills, to apply anywhere they want for a job that uses their skills.  In some countries, individuals can make money but still not move out of their class. This is true of Indian and Chinese entrepreneurs in southeast Asia and Africa.  In the U.S., where people can relocate, change jobs within a career and change careers, labor mobility reduces the average cost of labor and the average level of unemployment.

<P>

Education and freedom are unique to the American experience because it is so 
accessible to everyone -- especially because it has the ability to make the greatest impact on those in the lowest quintile.

<P>

My own career is an example of this.  My father never went to high school, my mother graduated from high school but never thought of college. But because I had the advantage of my parents' savings, a scholarship and federal loans, I was able to go to college and beyond that to get my doctorate in economics. Then I exercised my freedom to make a choice by applying for and getting a faculty position at Indiana University.  Then I was free again to move to Chicago and work at Kemper. 

<P>

With Kemper, shareholders are attempting to provide mutual funds to provide for the American dream of income mobility for their children.  It's our job -- and one we take seriously -- to help them realize that dream.

ALT="What's So Special About 6 Percent?">
<BR>

To market-watchers, plenty. A 6 percent yield on a 30-year Treasury bond is a benchmark for the economy. A higher cost of borrowing (when yields exceed 6 percent) limits the possibilities for corporations and consumers. 

<P>

Long-term yields have been as high as 8 percent in 1990, 1992 and 1994 -- which experts do not like to see. Why should Treasuries, which represent insignificant risk, yield 8 percent when the historical average return on stocks* -- an inherently riskier investment -- is 10 percent?

<P>

So, what's so special about 6 percent? Why not 5 percent or even less? Naturally, the lower the interest rates, the better for the economy. However, 6 percent is about as low as 30-year bonds have gone since they were introduced in 1977. (The yield was at its lowest, 5.78 percent, in the fall of 1993.) 

<P>

John Silvia, chief economist for Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc., is among those who look for the 6 percent barrier to be broken over the long run. "Interest rates seem low to us because of recent history," Silvia says. "But when you consider our real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of approximately 2.5 percent and our approximate 3 percent inflation rate, rates ought to be about 5.5 or 5.75 percent. That's assuming that the Federal Reserve maintains its focus on reducing inflation over time and that the federal budget deficit is eliminated over the next several years. Investors earning above 6 percent are getting a fair return given these possible outcomes."

<P>

<I>*From 1928 through 1995, the <A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">Standard & Poor's 500</A> returned an annual rate of 10.14 percent, according to Towers Data Systems. The S&P 500 is an unmanaged index that's generally considered representative of the U.S. stock market.

Supplied with a steady stream of government reports, corporate earnings
releases, analysts' forecasts and miscellaneous other data,
market-watchers are never at a loss for information. Their challenge: To
understand what's in each snapshot - as well as in the surrounding
environment that an individual market report may not have captured.
<P>

Here's where you'll find current market news, including our outlook and economic 
interpretations by John Silvia, chief economist for Kemper Funds' management. 
Because of the changing nature of this information, you'll
want to check back here often.

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048),

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<BR><BR>

Any overviews herein are intended to be general in nature and for current
interest. While helpful, these overviews are no substitute for
professional tax, financial or legal advice. Investors should seek
such professional advice for their particular situation. Neither

He writes on a broad range of economic subjects and his articles have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, The Far Eastern Economic Review, The Financial Times of London, The New York Times, The Nihon Kezai Shimbun, The Financial Analyst Journal, The Harvard Business Review, Foreign Policy and other publications. In 1978, he was appointed a member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board TaskForce on the Conceptual Framework (for accounting standards) because of articles he wrote on inflation accounting. He has frequently testified before Congressional committees on domestic and international economic policy issues and done briefings for senior officials in the executive branch, including President Bush. Since 1990, he also has been a consultant to the U.S. Department of Defense on how changes in the global economy are affecting U.S. security relationships.

<P>
The President has confirmed that the U.S. Treasury will begin
to issue inflation adjusted bonds in January of 1997.  The introduction
of the index linked bond represents a potentially important development
both for the future structure of the public debt as well as the
yield benchmarks which will be used to measure investment performance
in the fund management industry.  Investors have long used government
securities as a proxy for risk free returns in the financial markets.
 The introduction of the index linked bonds will now offer a proxy
for measuring inflation adjusted risk free return.
<P>
The U.S. will be the seventh OECD country to introduce index linked
government debt.  It already exists in Britain, Sweden, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and Iceland.  Some Latin American nations
also have offered inflation adjusted securities in the past but
they were designed to help their populations cope with hyper-inflation,
not moderate G-7 style inflation.  The British government introduced
the first G-7 index linked bonds in August 1981 and the initial
security offered a real yield of only 2.0% plus a tax free principal
adjustment for inflation.  At first, the securities were offered
only to pension funds but the rules were later modified to permit
purchases by individuals.
<P>
When the UK government introduced its first index linked bond,
many institutional investors responded positively because of their
disastrous experience with inflation during the 1970's.  In the
mid-1970's, conventional British government bonds had lost over
half of their value in nominal terms because Britain's inflation
rate had shot up to 30%.   In 1981, investors also had more modest
expectations of potential returns from securities than exist today.
 Between 1750 and 1950, the average yield on UK government securities
had been about 3.0% with an all time low of 2.21% in 1897.  The
British government's credit standing was so high that it was even
able to finance the First World War by selling bonds with a coupon
yield of 5.0%.   While commodity prices had fluctuated in a wide
range because of wars and changes in the global economy, the overall
British price level had been remarkably stable for nearly two
hundred years.  As a result, many pension funds perceived that
a government security which offered  a guaranteed real return
of 2.0% was an attractive asset.  High income individuals also
were attracted to the prospect of a bond principal inflation adjustment
which was free of income tax.  As a result of this investor support,
the UK government was able to sell over 6 billion pounds of index
linked debt during the first two years after their introduction
compared to a conventional debt stock of 150 billion pounds.
<P>
Between 1981 and 1995, the UK government's index linked securities
produced a cumulative nominal return of 154% and a cumulative
real yield of 40%.  But as the UK economy entered a period of
sustained disinflation after 1980, the return on index linked
securities significantly underperformed other asset classes, such
as equities and conventional government bonds.  Between 1981 and
1995, the UK stock market rose 5.7 times in nominal terms and
by nearly 3 times in real terms.  The price of conventional government
bonds rose by 72% while the real yield on long-term government
securities averaged 3.7%.  The real yield on Treasury bills also
averaged about 5.3% during the period 1981-1995 compared to 2.9%
on the index linked security.  <I>But while the index linked security
did not out perform conventional financial assets, it did produce
a better return than other traditional inflation hedges such as
gold and property.</I>  The British property market boomed during
the mid-1980's because of easy monetary policy but it slumped
so sharply during the early 1990's that index linked securities have out performed 
property for the period since they were introduced.  The nominal
yield on British property has averaged just under 9.0% since 1981
compared to an average nominal yield of 10% on the index linked
bonds.  The gold price peaked at $800 per ounce in 1980 and currently
sells for about $380 per ounce.
<P>
As a result of Britain's greatly improved inflation performance
under Mrs. Thatcher, the market for index linked securities never
developed  the breadth and liquidity of other asset markets. 
But the British government has been attempting to improve the market's liquidity
by doing about 15% of its recent funding in the index linked securities.
 As a result, the stock of index linked debt has expanded to 40
billion pounds compared to a net government debt stock of 260
billion pounds.
<P>
The introduction of index linked debt has produced major interest
cost savings for the British government.  The nominal yield on
index linked debt has averaged about 100-200 basis points below
the yields on other government securities.  The only cost to the
government has been the lost tax receipts from the inflation adjustment
for the depreciating real value of  bond principal.  But the savings
from reduced interest payments have been immediate while the tax
losses from indexation will be felt over the long term.  Before
the index linked bond  was introduced, the UK government had collected
tax on all interest income but it had exempted bonds from capital
gains taxation if they were held for longer than one year.

<B>August 26, 1996</B>
<P>

Several Wall Street newsletters are now suggesting that a victory for the Dole-Kemp ticket in the presidential election would boost equity prices by lowering capital gains taxes while increasing long-term bond yields because of investor concerns about a return to large federal budget deficits. 
<P>
While it is natural for investors to be concerned about the budgetary affects of Republican promises to reduce taxes, the history of the past ten years should have demonstrated that it is the nation's savings and investment balance, not just budget deficits, which determine interest rates.  As a result the impact of the  Dole economic program on bond yields will depend upon how it influences the country's private savings behavior and demand for capital, not just the federal government's deficit.  Several factors suggest that the Dole program will have a less damaging impact on either the federal deficit or interest rates than many Wall Street pundits now fear.
<P>
First, under current law, no administration can enact a tax cut unless there are offsetting spending cuts.  This law was enacted in order to force the Congress to adhere to long-term targets for deficit reduction and it is doubtful that a president as cautious about fiscal policy as Mr. Dole would repeal it.  Indeed, the threat of a bond market collapse would probably constrain Congress from repealing the law even if the Dole-Kemp administration decided to revert to high deficit fiscal policy. As the ratio of federal debt to GDP is now about 55% compared to 28% when Ronald Reagan became president, the markets will be far less tolerant of large scale fiscal stimulus than they were during the early 1980's
<P>
Secondly, the Dole administration has a broad based economic growth agenda of which personal tax cuts are only one part.  The Dole program is also committed to reducing the cost of government regulation and the legal system on U.S. business, slashing capital gains taxes and slowing the growth of Federal spending.  Regulatory cost push has played such a major role in driving up business costs during the past three decades that there is a stronger statistical relationship between the number of pages in the federal register and interest rates than between federal deficits and interest rates.  The register peaked at nearly 90,000 pages during the high inflation era of the late 1970's and fell steadily to a trough of 49,000 during the late 1980's.  The Clinton administration has pushed it back to 70,000, so if a Dole White House could reduce it back to Reagan era levels there would be potential benefits for both inflation and interest rates.
<P>
If the Dole program encourages corporations to invest more aggressively, interest rates could rise because of strong demand for capital in the private sector, not increased government borrowing.  But, as the Dole program has far more modest tax incentives for investment than the Reagan program of 1981, it will probably only have a modest impact on private capital demands and interest rates.  The Reagan program directly subsidized investment through large increases in depreciation allowances whereas the Dole program is focused on capital gains relief and regulatory reform.
<P>
The overall scope of  the Dole fiscal program is also very modest compared to the tax changes which occurred during the Reagan years.  The Dole program would reduce the top marginal tax rate to 34% whereas during the Reagan years it declined to 28%.  If Congress enacted every tax change proposed by the Dole-Kemp platform without cutting spending, the net fiscal stimulus to the economy would be only $58 billion during 1998 compared to a nominal GDP of $8 trillion.  It is also quite likely that the capital gains tax cut would produce such a huge revenue windfall that the federal deficit would shrink during the twelve to twenty four months after the
 enactment of the Dole tax program.  As a result of the equity bull market since 1991, the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP in the U.S. is now 95% compared to a previous all time peak of 82% in 1929 and a sixty year moving average of 48%.  If the household sector could realize capital gains with a tax rate of only 14%, there would be a realignment of portfolios on a scale so large that the Treasury would experience a massive revenue windfall.
<P>
Thirdly, the presidential campaign cannot be viewed in isolation from the congressional election campaign.  Under the influence of consultant Richard Morris, the President recast himself as a conservative on many social and economic issues during the first half of 1996 but the Democratic Party in the Congress remains far to the left of the President.  During most of the 20th Century, the Congressional Democratic Party was well balanced between membership from the rural south and the urban northeast and middle west.  During the 1990's, though, the Democratic Party has lost most of its congressional membership in the south and became heavily dependent upon the urban centers of the Northeast, the middle west, and California.  In the House, for example, the Republicans now have 78 of the 125 seats in the old southern confederacy  compared to only 6 in 1960.  As a result of  the pending retirement of many long-term Democratic incumbents, the Republican share of southern seats could easily rise to 90-100 this autumn even if the party loses seats elsewhere in the country.  If the Democratic Party regains control of the House with only 20-30 southern seats, many of their most influential committee chairmen will be far to the left not just of current Republican chairmen but also of previous Democratic chairmen.  The contrast between a house speaker Richard Gephardt and the old Democratic house speaker, Tom Foley, would also be very striking.  After flirting with so-called "new Democrat" themes in the mid-1980's, Rep. Gephardt has devoted most of the past decade to promoting protectionist trade policies and new forms of federal intervention in the economy.  President Clinton  has so far resisted most of the congressional Democrats' economic proposals,  but as a result of his apparent flexibility on many issues, the financial markets are uncertain about how he would manage a more left wing Democratic Congress if he is reelected to a second term.  The great fear haunting the U.S. bond market today is not a Dole-Kemp victory in the Presidential election and the enactment of a modest Republican tax cut program.  It is what would happen to government spending, the cost of federal regulation, and trade policy in the event that the Democrats made a sweep of both the White House and the Congress.  Such a sweep would probably encourage an immediate wave of selling by foreign investors in the U.S. bond market and a slump in the stock markets of emerging market economies sensitive to U.S. trade policy.

<b>An address given to the National Conference of State Legislatures, St. Louis, July 28, 1996</b><br>
<br>

<p>
America's system of federalism will face unique challenges during the
late 1990's and early years of the 21st century.<p>
<p>
The Congress wants to devolve more responsibilities to the states at the same
time that the costs of funding traditional services, such as Medicare and
education, are projected to rise sharply.  As a result of the long expansion
which the U.S. economy has enjoyed since 1991, most states are currently in
good fiscal shape but the late 1990's could produce great financial stresses
for them if their increased responsibilities coincide with a recession.
Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that devolution against a
background of recession could set the stage for other radical policy changes,
such as the privatization of many state owned enterprises and services.<p>
<p>
The fiscal challenge which will confront American states during the late 1990's
has several dimensions.<p>
<p>
First, the Congress wants to reduce the aid which it provides to American
states as well as to alter the formulas through which it is distributed.  In
the budget debate, six months ago, the Congress wanted to reduce federal
assistance to the states by 26%.  It is doubtful that future cuts will be that
large but it is not difficult to imagine cuts of 15-20% if Congress continues
to push for a balanced federal budget by the year 2000.   The pressure to
reduce federal laid to the states does not just reflect the political ideology
of the newly ascendant Republican Party.  It is also a by-product of
demographic factors.  The population of the U.S. will age steadily during the
next few decades and cause entitlement spending for the retired to rise
sharply.  The federal government share of GDP will also increase significantly
unless other forms of spending are curtailed.  The problem of demography in the
U.S. is much less serious than in other industrial countries because of its
high level of immigration and higher birthrate but aging is still a general
problem for all the industrial nations.  In fact, two thirds of all the people
who have ever lived to the age of 65 in the long history of mankind are alive
today.  Such simple facts reveal more about the forces driving public spending
in the modern world than all the political science journals which debate the
philosophical implications of public spending choices.<p>
<p>
Secondly, the Congress wants to shift from open ended matching grant assistance
to the states to block grants.  Under the new system, the states would receive
a fixed sum of money and be given more flexibility in how they chose to spend
it.  But in contrast to the current system, their aid would not increase
automatically in response to some economic shock, such as a recession.  The new
system of financing would represent a sharp break with the pattern of financing
which has prevailed during most of the modern era under both Democratic and
Republican administrations.  During the Bush administration, for example,
federal aid to the states rose from $124 billion to $194 billion.  Much of the
increase resulted from the impact of the 1990-1991 recession on social service
programs. But part of it also resulted from the states shifting Medicaid costs
to the federal government as well as increases in matching grants from other
federally mandated programs.  As a result of the growth of federal spending
during the Bush years, aid to the states is currently equal to about 3.2% of
GDP compared to a post war peak of 3.6% of GDP in 1973, 1.9% in 1965, and 0.9%
in 1940.<p>
<p>
Thirdly, despite the sharp drop in the U.S. inflation rate, the federal budget
is projecting that Medicaid spending will continue to rise at a 8% annual rate.
In the federal budget,  Medicaid expenditures will grow from $168 billion to
$267 billion.  As the states account for about 43% of Medicaid spending, their
outlays will also expand.  Some states are trying to control costs by forcing
their recipients to use HMO's, but in many states there is so much public
hostility to HMO's that legislatures are enacting laws which require them to be
less severe in rationing their services.<p>
<p>
Fourthly, the population of school age children is once again expanding.  It is
projected to grow from 47 million in 1991 to 56 million in 2004, surpassing the
old 1971 peak of 51 million.  The GAO says that the U.S. needs to spend $112
billion on new school construction compared to recent outlays of $3 billion per
annum.<p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the U.S. electorate remains hostile to the idea of tax increases.
Almost none were enacted by state legislatures during the past two years while
the Congress itself flirted with the idea of reducing federal gasoline taxes a
few months ago.<p>
<p>
There is also growing public opposition to the spread of gambling.  Lotteries
will probably continue to generate revenue equal to about 2.5% of state tax
receipts, but there will be far more restrictions on the introduction of new
casinos.  It appears that only three states will permit the establishment of
significant casino industries.  They are Nevada, New Jersey and Mississippi.
<p>
<p>
The good news is that state governments are in better fiscal shape to confront
these challenges then at any other time during the past decade.<p>
<p>
The economy has enjoyed five years of steady growth, so the state and local
government sector enjoys a healthy budget surplus.  There also have been far
fewer  regional disparities in the national economy's performance during the
current expansion than was the case during the 1970's and 1980's.<p>
<p>
In the 1970's, the U.S. economy's growth leaders were states producing oil and
other commodities enjoying sharply higher prices.  In the 1980's, there were
booms on both coasts while the middle west suffered from the overvalued dollar
and the western states were crippled by collapsing commodity prices and bankin
crisis.  In the early 1990's, new England and California experienced severe
slumps but both have recovered during recent years while other regions have
continued to enjoy steady growth.<p>
<p>
As a result of the length and breadth of the national expansion, the state and
local government sector currently enjoys a budget surplus of $40 billion
excluding pension funds compared to $11 billion five years ago.  The surplus as
a share of GDP is only about 0.6% or well below the 1.2% peak of the 1980's
business cycle but it is a respectable number for an expansion which has been
characterized by such low inflation.<p>
<p>
The U.S. economy's current cyclical environment is exceptionally benign for the
sixth year of a business cycle.  The unemployment rate has dropped to 5.3% but
inflation is still only about 3.0% excluding food and fuel.    The growth rate
of real output is likely to average about 2.6% this year compared to 2.0% last
year and 3.5% during 1994.<p>
<p>
The economy's outstanding inflation performance has surprised many analysts and
explains why the business cycle has been so prolonged.  The Federal Reserve has
had no incentive to surpress the expansion in order to promote price
stability.<p>
<p>
There are several factors which explain why the U.S. economy has been able to
enjoy such a benign combination of low unemployment and low inflation.<p>
First, the current business cycle has enjoyed some very positive supply side
characteristics.  There has been such robust business investment that during
the past two years the growth rate of manufacturing capacity has accelerated to
nearly 4.5% from 2.0% during the early 1990's.<p>
<p>
Secondly, U.S. firms have been very aggressive in controlling costs and
boosting productivity.  The restructuring has created social concerns about
employment stability, especially in large companies, but the growth of profits
has helped to set the stage for an extraordinary boom in job creation.  Total
employment has expanded by over 10 million spare jobs since 1992 whereas during
the period 1988-1992 it grew by only about 3.5 million jobs.<p>
<p>
Thirdly, American firms have been on the cutting edge of developing and
introducing new technology. In the U.S., the ratio of computers to workers is
now at 57 per 100 in the corporate sector compared to 20 in Western Europe, 16
in Japan, and 4 in southeast Asia. There are new technology oriented companies
on the stock market with capitalizations of $2-3 billion which did not exist
three years ago.  The Internet firm, Netscape, now has a market capitalization
of $3.9 billion compared to zero two years ago.  The capitalization of
Microsoft has expanded from $24 billion in 1992 to $75 billion recently.  IBM's
market capitalization has even rebounded to $55.5 from $28.5 billion in late
1992 but is still far below its peak of over $100 billion in the late 1980's.<p>
<p>
Fourthly, the Federal Reserve has done an excellent job of managing the
business cycle.  There was an upsurge of output growth during 1994 which
strained available inventories and caused commodity prices to rise sharply.
This change in the price environment could have set the stage for an
acceleration in the inflation rate but the Fed moved quickly to reduce the
economy's growth rate to the 2.0-2.5% range from 3.5-4.0% in order to restrain
inflationary pressures  As a result, commodity prices corrected and the Fed was
able to ease monetary policy during early 1995.  The Fed will face new
challenges in restraining inflation later this year but it enjoys so much
credibility that the price of restraining inflation will be much less severe
than during the business cycles of the 1970's and early 1980's.<p>
