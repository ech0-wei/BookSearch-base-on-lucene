<p>Needle exchange talking points </p>

<p>Origins of the University of California study </p>

<p>Former drug czar Bob Martinez and former Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) director Bill Roper decide in Summer '91 that
objective review of data on needle exchange programs (NEPs) is
needed </p>

<p>University of California (UC), Berkeley and UC San Francisco
agree to do the work </p>

<p>Study is funded by CDC through a Cooperative Agreement with
the Association of Schools of Public Health </p>

<p>Pls are Arthur Reingold (UC Berkeley) and Philip R. Lee (UC
San Francisco) </p>

<p>Lee leaves 7/1/94 to be Assistant Secretary for Health;
replaced as Pl by Peter Lurie, formerly Project Director </p>

<p>Approximate total cost of study $400,000 </p>

<p>Work begins 4/1/92 </p>

<p>The University of California study </p>

<p>3 volumes, &gt;700 pages </p>

<p>Entailed review of 2000 documents, visits to 23 programs in 15
cities in 4 countries, interviews with almost 250 individuals,
mail survey of programs not visited, mathematical modeling of
cost-effectiveness </p>

<p>Conclusions: </p>

<p>available [data] provide no evidence that needle exchange
programs increase the amount of drug use by needle exchange
program clients or change overall community levels of
non-injection and injection drug use.&quot; (page 18 of report
Summary) </p>

<p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that it is likely that NEPs
decrease the rate of new HIV infection: (page 26) </p>

<p>1. Biologic plausibility; removing potentially infected
syringes from circulation and replacing them with clean ones must
decrease new infections </p>

<p>2. Behavioral data: 10/14 studies showed a decrease in HIV
risk behavior (the sharing of syringes) and none showed an
increase </p>

<p>3. Three- to four-fold decrease in new hepatitis B infections
[with later data this increased to seven- to eight-fold for
hepatitis B and C infection] </p>

<p>4. Mathematical models from New Haven (33% decrease in new HIV
infections) and by the UC study model (15-17% </p>

<p>Recommendations (page 27): </p>

<p>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services.&quot; </p>

<p>Substantial federal funds should be committed to both
providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into
these programs. </p>

<p>State governments in the ten states and the District of
Columbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws. </p>

<p>States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to
syringes. </p>

<p>Report released 9/30/93 </p>

<p>About 12,000 copies of various volumes of the report
distributed </p>

<p>The first review </p>

<p>On October 15, 1993, Joe Boufford, Principal Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Health (Lee's office), writes to CDC Director David
Satcher requesting a review of the UC report and providing
opinions and recommendations for federal action in response to
needle exchange. </p>

<p>CDC consults with NIH (NIDA), FDA, HRSA and SAMSHA (Substance
Abuse Mental Health Services Administration). Their comments are
attached as tabs to the review. </p>

<p>Conclusions: </p>

<p>The UC research team has done a careful and scientifically
sound compilation and review of all the available data on needle
exchange and the availability of needles and syringes to
injection drug users.&quot; (page 1) The UC team used stringent
scientific standards in its analysis and interpretation of the
collected published and unpublished studies ... The UC report is
the most extensive and comprehensive study of needle exchange
ever published.&quot; (page 6) </p>

<p>After reviewing several lines of evidence similar to the four
points listed above, the review concludes: Taken together, these
observations indicate that NEPs are likely to reduce HIV
transmission, even though the epidemiologic studies of NEPs do
not definitively demonstrate decreases or increases in HIV
transmission.&quot; (page 2) Several findings strongly support
the conclusion that NEPs reduce HIV transmission.&quot; (page 10)
</p>

<p>No data exists indicating increases related to NEPs in either
drug use or in the number of discarded syringes.&quot; (page 2)
We agree with the UC team conclusion that available data are
quite limited but provide no evidence of any NEP-related
increases in community levels of drug use.&quot; (page 10) </p>

<p>&quot;... we believe that the benefits of NEPs as a component
of a comprehensive HIV prevention program for drug users exceed
the theoretical risks of such programs.&quot; (page 2) </p>

<p>&quot;We conclude that the ban on Federal funding of NEPs
should be lifted to allow communities and States to use Federal
funds to support NEPs as components of comprehensive HIV
prevention programs.&quot; (page 2) </p>

<p>&quot;We also recommend that States consider the repeal of
laws requiring a physician's prescription to buy needles and
syringes and the removal of criminal penalties for the possession
of needles and syringes&quot; (page 2) </p>

<p>Fate of the first review </p>

<p>Review signed by Satcher and sent to Boufford on December 10,
1993. </p>

<p>Review has never been made public. </p>

<p>Rep. Henry Waxman obtained a copy, but only under condition
that it not be released to the public. </p>

<p>Review not disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act; a
request by San Francisco Chronicle for the review was denied
recently. </p>

<p>Only real press coverage is reference to the coverup on CNN in
August 1994 and in San Francisco Chronicle in December 1994. </p>

<p>The second review </p>

<p>In fall 1994, Brian Biles of the Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Health, wrote to CDC asking for an update on
information since the University of California Report. </p>

<p>This second review, much shorter and less expansive than the
first review, is sent to the Associate Director for HIV/AIDS
(James Curran) by the Assistant Director for Substance Abuse and
HIV Prevention (T. Stephen Jones) on November 22, 1994, and
presumably forwarded on to the Office of the Assistant Secretary
for Health. </p>

<p>The review contains the following: </p>

<p>Summary of new evidence from New York City showing a decrease
in HIV transmission among NEP clients that concludes that
although the numbers are small, the evidence is plausible.&quot;
(page 1 ). </p>

<p>Three additional studies with evidence of decreases in HIV
risk behavior (page 3). </p>

<p>No evidence of increased drug use in a San Francisco study
(page 3). </p>

<p>New data showing that the decrease in hepatitis B and C
infections associated with needle exchange is now seven- to
eight-fold. 'this study demonstrates more clearly than any
previous research that use of NEPs is associated with decreases
in blood borne infections.&quot; (Page 4) </p>

<p>Data from Montreal showing higher HIV infection rates, higher
rates of HIV risk behaviors and higher rates of new HIV infection
among NEP clients that &quot;require further study.&quot; (page
5) This finding is most reasonably interpreted as showing that
NEPs are reaching the drug users at highest risk for HIV (a good
thing). </p>

<p>No formal recommendations with respect to federal policy. </p>

<p>The existence of this review has never been made public. </p>

<p>Public health significance </p>

<p>Approximately 1/3 of all AIDS cases occur among injections
drug users, their sex partners and their children. </p>

<p>Only about 15% of injectors are in drug treatment on any given
day. </p>

<p>Over 10,000 drug users, their sex partners and their children
contract HIV each year. This is 1-2 preventable HIV infections
per hour. Needle exchange may decrease new HIV infections by 33%,
according to the New Haven mathematical model. </p>

<p>1. ISSUE </p>

<p>On October 15, 1993, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Health requested that the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) review the University of California (UC)
research report on needle exchange (executive summary at Tab A)
and provide recommendations and opinions on Federal action in
response to needle exchange to the Principal Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General. </p>

<p>The UC report and recommendations were reviewed by CDC staff.

(SAMHSA) (Tab C), the Health Services and Resources
Administration (HSRA) (Tab D), and the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) (Tab E). Comments on this report to you were
also requested from these agencies. The agencies were not asked
for final concurrence on the CDC response. The attached comments
(Tabs B-E) were provided by the Principal AIDS Coordinators of
the four agencies. </p>

<p>2. SUMMARY </p>

<p>The UC research team has done a careful and scientifically
sound compilation and review of all the available data on needle
exchange and the availability of needles and syringes to
injection drug users (IDUs). The UC team also gathered new data
through surveys of needle exchange programs (NEPs), key informant
interviews, and focus groups of IDUs. </p>

<p>NEPs are intended to decrease human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) transmission associated with injection drug use by
replacing used, potentially HIV-infected syringes with sterile
ones. They also can help IDUs obtain drug treatment and other
public health services. The emergence of more than three dozen
NEPs in the United States suggests an increasing acceptance of
these programs as part of a community response to the dual
epidemics of injection drug use and HIV infection. However, in
some communities, NEPs have been very controversial. Some law
enforcement, drug treatment, and community leaders are concerned
that these programs give &quot;the wrong message&quot; about drug
use and may reduce law enforcement agencies' ability to combat
drug use and associated violence. Other concerns are that NEPs
have not been shown to be effective in eliminating HIV
transmission and may draw scarce resources away from other,
possibly more effective, programs such as drug treatment. </p>

<p>The CDC concurs with the UC findings that (1) NEPs are
effective in removing used, sometimes HIV-contaminated needles
and syringes from circulation and replacing them with sterile
ones, (2) IDUs using NEPs decrease HIV drug-risk behaviors (e.g.,
decreased sharing of injection equipment, decreased frequency of
injection), (3) NEPs are effective in recruiting IDUs to enter
drug treatment, (4) HIV prevalence in syringes returned to NEPs
decreases, and (5) mathematical models of NEPs estimate
substantial decreases in HIV transmission among NEP clients.
Taken together, these observations indicate that NEPs are likely
to reduce HIV transmission, even though the epidemiologic studies
of NEPs do not definitively demonstrate decreases or increases in
HIV transmission. The existing epidemiologic studies are limited
in their ability to detect such changes. No data exists
indicating increases related to NEPs in either drug use or in the
number of discarded syringes. W8 endorse the UC report
recommendation that additional research and evaluation on NEPs is
a high priority to further assess the impact of these programs-s
and the relative effectiveness of various models of delivery of
NEP services. </p>

<p>Two other issues have prompted reconsideration of Federal
policy on needle exchange: (1) the magnitude of the HIV epidemic
among IDUs and the related epidemics among their sex partners and
newborns in many areas of this country and (2) the limitations of
alternative intervention options to prevent drug-related HIV
transmission (e.g., limited capacity of drug treatment available
to IDUs and limitations of bleach disinfection of injection
equipment). Based on these observations and the weight of data
presented in the UC report, we believe that the benefits of NEPs
as a component of a comprehensive HIV prevention program for drug
users exceed the theoretical risks of such programs. We conclude
that the ban on Federal funding of NEPs should be lifted to allow
communities and States to use Federal funds to support NEPs as
components of comprehensive HIV prevention programs. We recommend
that NEPs receiving Federal funds be linked to substance abuse
treatment programs and other HIV prevention services. We also
recommend that such programs be required to include evaluation
components to validate their effectiveness. </p>

<p>Increasing the ability of IDUs to obtain and possess sterile
needles and syringes should decrease HIV transmission for those
who will not or cannot stop injecting drugs. Therefore, we also
recommend that States consider the repeal of laws requiring a
physician's prescription to buy needles and syringes and the
removal of criminal penalities[sic] for the possession of needles
and syringes, while maintaining the criminal penalties on other
drug use equipment. Additional evaluation of these interventions
is crucial. </p>

<p>3. BACKGROUND </p>

<p>The substantial role of injection drug use in the HIV/AIDS
epidemic </p>

<p>One-third of reported U.S. AIDS cases are related directly or
indirectly to injection drug use[1]. A disproportionate number of
AIDS cases among people of color in the United States is related
to infection drug use. In 1992, almost half of all AIDS cases
reported among African Americans (49 percent) and Hispanics (48
percent) were directly or indirectly related to injection drug
use. </p>

<p>The majority of reported AIDS cases among women and children
in the United States are related to injection drug use. Among
adult and adolescent women reported with AIDS in this country,
nearly three-quarters (71 percent) were directly or indirectly
related to injection drug use; 50 percent of women with AIDS
reported injecting drugs and an additional 21 percent reported
sexual contact with a male who injected drugs. Two-thirds (66
percent) of children with perinatally acquired AIDS had mothers
who reported injecting drugs themselves and/or having sex with an
IDU. </p>

<p>Preventing HIV/AIDS associated with injection drug use </p>

<p>Use of drug injection equipment (especially needles and
syringes) by more than one person (often called
&quot;sharing&quot; or &quot;multiperson use&quot;) is the
primary mechanism for the spread of HIV related to injection drug
use. Sexual transmission among IDUs also occurs. Several cultural
and social factors are associated with the multiperson use of
needles and syringes and other injection equipment. However,
legal restrictions on the purchasing and possession of needles
and syringes by IDUs are central factors in the multiperson use
of needles and syringes. IDUs' access to and legal ability to
possess sterile needles and syringes are limited by a variety of
State and Federal laws, including (1) prescription laws[2], (2)
drug paraphernalia laws[3], and (3) the </p>

<p>[1]AIDS cases associated with injection drug use include AIDS
cases among a) heterosexual men and all women who report
injecting drugs, b) men who have sex with men who also inject
drugs, c) men and women who do not inject drugs but have
heterosexual relations with drug injectors, and d) newborn
children whose mothers inject drugs or have sex with male drug
injectors. </p>

<p>[2]A State law that requires a physician's prescription as a
condition for sale of needles and syringes in pharmacies (in 10
States and the District of Columbia}. </p>

<p>Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act[4]. In
States without prescription laws, the selective refusal of some
pharmacists to sell needles and syringes to persons who might be
IDUs is an additional barrier. </p>

<p>In its July 1991 report on &quot;The Twin Epidemics of
Substance Use and HIV, n the National Commission on AIDS
recommended: &quot;Remove legal barriers to the purchase and
possession of injection equipment. Such legal barriers... limit
the availability of new/clean injection equipment and therefore
encourage the sharing of injection equipment, and the increase in
HIV transmission. </p>

<p>Prevention and treatment for drug dependency and addiction are
important HIV prevention strategies. However, only 10 to 20
percent of all drug users are in drug treatment programs at any
given time. Drug treatment capacity is not expected to increase
substantially in the near future, and the capacity will remain
smaller than that required to provide drug treatment for all who
need it and are willing to start. In addition, a substantial
proportion of IDUs are unable or unwilling to stop injecting
drugs and start drug treatment. </p>

<p>Outreach programs are another component of HIV prevention for
IDUs. In addition to providing condoms and advising drug users to
start drug treatment and to decrease drug use, since the
mid-1980s, outreach workers have advocated the use of household
bleach to disinfect drug-injection equipment (particularly
needles and syringes). In April 1993, the CDC, the Center for
Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) of SAMHSA, and the National
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) of NIH issued an HIV Prevention
Bulletin describing the limitations of bleach disinfection of
needles and syringes and indicating that (1) sterile, never-used
needles-and syringes are-safer than bleach-disinfected,
previously used needles and syringes and (2) bleach disinfection
is useful only when there is no other safer option. In this
statement, Public Health Service (PHS) agencies clearly pointed
out the limitations of one of the few HIV risk-reduction
interventions for IDUs who share needles and syringes. </p>

<p>[3]A State (or local) law that places criminal penalties on
the possession and distribution of needles and syringes and other
equipment used in the consumption or manufacture of drugs (in 46
States and the District of Columbia. </p>

<p>[4]The Act includes needles and syringes in the list of drug
paraphernalia that cannot be transported by the U.S. Postal
Service or any other means of interstate conveyance. </p>

<p>4. LEGAL RESTRICTIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDING OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE
PROGRAMS IS THE UNITED STATES </p>

<p>Congress has included provisions in at least six laws
restricting the use of Federal funds for NEPs. For example, the
FY 1994 Appropriations Act for the Department states that
&quot;no funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry
out any program of distribution of sterile needles for hypodermic
injection of any illegal drug, unless the Surgeon General of the
United States determines that such programs are effective in
preventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of
illegal drugs, except that such funds may be used for such
purposes in furtherance of demonstrations or studies authorized
in the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (Public Law 102-321).&quot; </p>

<p>5. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORT (&quot;THE PUBLIC
HEALTH IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES
AND ABROAD&quot;) </p>

<p>This project was carried out by a team of researchers at the
School of Public Health of the University of California,
Berkeley, and the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the
University of-California, San Francisco. The study began in April
1992 and was supported by funds from the CDC through a
cooperative agreement with the Association of Schools of Public
Health. </p>

<p>The project staff gathered nearly 2,000 &quot;data
sources,&quot; including journal articles (475), conference
abstracts (381), reports (236), and unpublished materials (159).
Between May and September 1992, the team carried out site visits
to 15 cities (10 in the United States, -3-in Canada, and 2 in
Europe). During these site visits, structured observations of 33
needle exchange sessions were made. In addition, 110 key
informants (including NEP staff, public health officials, and
community leaders supporting and opposing the NEP) were
interviewed, and 18 focus groups of clients and non-clients of
the-NEPs (12-9 IDUs ~ participated in the focus groups or
individual interviews) were held by the UC project staff. UC
project staff obtained extensive information on the budgets of
the NEPs visited. To obtain a more complete picture of the NEPs
in the United States, the project staff conducted a postal survey
of 20 NEPs not visited. </p>

<p>The major findings of the UC study are presented in a Summary,
Conclusion, and Recommendations document (43 pages). The detailed
analysis and findings of the UC study are presented in Volume One
(519 pages). Volume Two, a city-by-city description of NEP
activities and related information from the site visits to nine
U.S. and three Canadian cities, will be available in late
December 1993. </p>

<p>Drafts of all chapters of the UC report were reviewed by a
distinguished panel of expert reviewers representing a range of
opinions on needle exchange (Dr. Mindy Fullilove, Dr. Don Des
Jarlais, Dr. Ed Kaplan, Dr. Herbert Kleber, Dr. Douglas Owens,
Dr. Beny Primm, and Ms. Beth Weinstein). </p>

<p>The UC teas used stringent scientific standards in its
analysis and interpretation of the collected published and
unpublished studies on NEPs and needle and syringe availability.
The UC report is the most extensive and comprehensive study of
needle exchange ever published. </p>

<p>6. NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA </p>

<p>The information in this section on NEPs in the United States
and Canada is derived from the UC report. </p>

<p>The first NEP to provide comprehensive services in the United
States opened in 1988 in Tacoma, Washington. As of September 1,
1993, there were at least 37 NEPs operating in 30 cities in 12
States. By June 1993, more than 5.4 million syringes had been
distributed (almost always in exchange for used syringes) by NEPs
in the United States. In calendar year 1992, U.S. NEPs
distributed more than 2.4 million syringes. </p>

<p>Needle exchange has provoked intense political debate at the
national level and in some States (e.g., California, New York)
and cities (e.g., Baltimore, New York City, Boston, Berkeley).
Nonetheless, in many cities (e.g., Seattle, Tacoma, San
Francisco, Honolulu,- New Haven), large-scale NEPs have been
established with substantial community support. In New York City,
after years of intense political debate, five NEPs were legally
opened in 1992 and now distribute about one million syringes a
year. The UC team collected U.S. public opinion polls that-at-
included questions regarding needle availability needle cleaning.
These public opinion polls indicate that approximately half of
the general public has supported harm reduction efforts,
including needle cleaning, legalization of needles sales, needle
exchange, and needle distribution. While this public support has
tended to increase over time and has been somewhat higher for
needle exchange than for needle distribution, needle exchange
remains a controversial issue. </p>

<p>Substantial variations exist among U.S. NEPs in legal status,
administrative structure, and sources of funding. Nineteen U.S.
NEPs are &quot;legal,&quot;[5] eight are
&quot;illegal-tolerated,&quot;[6] and six are
&quot;illegal-underground.&quot;[7] Six U.S. NEPs are
administered by State or local governments, six by
community-based organizations (CBOs with government sponsorship,
eight by CBOs without government sponsorship, and thirteen by
what the UC report called &quot;activist&quot; organizations.
Private donations are a major source of funding at 19 U.S. NEPs,
more than any other source of funding. Fourteen NEPs are
financially supported by foundation grants, 12 by funds from a
CBO and/or activist organization administering the NEP, 12 by
city or county government, and 4 by State governments. Fifteen
U.S. NEPs depend entirely on volunteer staff, and all but seven
NEPs use volunteers. Twenty-seven of 33 U.S. NEPs surveyed or
visited have &quot;one-for-one rules&quot; (one sterile syringe
is given out for each syringe turned in). Seventeen NEPs provide
'starter needles&quot; (one or more [usually three] syringes
provided to new NEP clients without requiring turn-in of used
syringes). Ten NEPs have limits on the number of syringes that
can be exchanged. Rules governing the exchange procedures are
generally well enforced. </p>

<p>U.S. NEPs serve ethnically diverse IDU populations that
generally reflect local ethnic and racial patterns. The mean age
of U.S. NEP clients ranges from 33-41 years with a mean duration
of drug injection ranging from 7-20 years. NEPs successfully
reach IDUs who are not enrolled in drug treatment, with studies
in the United States reporting one-third to one-half of NEP
clients having no prior exposure to drug treatment. NEP clients
are at significant risk for drug-related HIV transmission with 10
to 60 percent reporting some needle sharing and about one-third
reported sharing needles in the month preceding interview. </p>

<p>U.S. NEPs are reaching thousands of IDUs in the 30 cities in
which they operate. In addition to needle exchange, a variety of
public health services are provided on site or are available by
referral, including drug treatment, HIV counseling and testing,
primary medical care, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted
disease screening and treatment, and social services. The UC team
found that among NEPs visited with data on these activities, six
NEPs had referred more than 2,000 drug users to drug treatment
and that more than 800 drug users had started drug treatment
after referral by four NEPs. </p>

<p>[5]An NEP in a State that does not have a prescription law or
an NEP that has a specific exemption to the prescription law. </p>

<p>[6]In a state with a prescription law, an NEP which a locally
elected body (e.g., city council) has voted to support or
approve. </p>

<p>[7]In a State with a prescription law, an illegal-underground
NEP which has not been supported by a locally elected body. </p>

<p>The median annual budget of U.S. and Canadian needle exchange
programs visited is relatively low at 5169,000, with government
run programs tending to have larger budgets. Some NEPs are more
expensive because they also provide substantial additional
services such as drug treatment referrals. </p>

<p>The UC team extensively reviewed the previously published
mathematical models that estimated the impact of NEPs on HIV
transmission, and developed additional models of the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NEPs in the United
States. These efforts, in agreement with other independent
reviews (e.g., the General Accounting Office [GAO] review),
confirmed the theoretical and technical validity of the model
used to estimate the impact of the New Haven NEP. Applied to
other cities, a simplified version of this model predicted
reductions ranging from 17 to 70 percent in new drug-related HIV
infections among NEP clients. In one of the cities, the estimated
cost-per-HIV-infection-averted by NEPs was between S3,700 and
$12,000. These estimated costs of preventing an HIV infection
compare very favorably with the costs of other lifesaving
programs and are much less than the present value of the lifetime
costs of medical care for a person with HIV infection ($119,000)
. </p>

<p>The UC report also reviews the development of NEPs in Canada,
where the federal government provided leadership and initial
funding (requiring provincial matching funds) for HIV prevention
programs for drug users, including NEPs. In Canada all NEPs are
legal, and there has been very limited community or professional
opposition to the NEPs. Since the first Canadian NEPs were opened
in 1989, the number of cities with active NEPs has steadily
increased to a total of 28 cities in early 1993. More than 2.5
million syringes were distributed through December 1992 by the
five Canadian NEPs visited by the UC team. </p>

<p>7. IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ON DRUG USE </p>

<p>Accurate measurement of drug use patterns and numbers of drug
users in communities is technically very challenging, in part
because drug use is-an illegal activity. Therefore-, it is
extremely difficult to quantitatively assess the impact of NEPs
on community drug use. </p>

<p>The UC report provides data on both the behavior of NEP
clients and community measures of drug use. The UC report clearly
documents that substantial numbers of IDUs (both clients and
non-clients of the NEP) have been referred to drug treatment
programs, a substantial step in reducing drug use by those
individuals and in the community. The UC report presents the
results of 26 evaluations in the United States and abroad that
provide information on changes in drug-risk behavior among IDUs
who were using NEPs; 16 of the 26 were judged to be of acceptable
scientific quality. Although not definitive, the majority of
these studies found that drug-related risk behaviors for HIV
transmission were significantly reduced among NEP clients. </p>

<p>In addition, the UC team reviewed national drug use indicators
and the findings of IDU focus groups. The limited data for U.S.
cities with NEPs from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), Drug
Use Forecasting (DUF) system, and Uniform Crime Reports do not
show clear trends in patterns of drug use in those cities with
NEPs. The IDU focus groups conducted in cities with NEPs
consistently indicated that the participants believed that NEPs
would have little effect on drug use in the community. </p>

<p>We agree with the UC team conclusion that available data are
quite limited but provide no evidence of any NEP-related
increases in community levels of drug use. However, the
limitations of both available research methods and existing data
addressing this issue underline the need for continuing
evaluation and research on the impact of NEPs on drug use.
Additional evaluation and research and the development of new
research methods in this area should be a component of Federally
supported NEPs. </p>

<p>A key concern of NEP opponents is that these programs will
directly or indirectly increase drug use. Opponents view NEPs as
directly increasing drug use by providing the means (needles and
syringes) to inject drugs. They also see NEPs as indirectly
promoting drug use by appearing to condone and facilitate drug
use and thereby undermining the credibility of society's message
that using drugs is illegal, unhealthy and morally wrong.
However, no study in the United States or abroad was found that
showed that NEPs increase community drug use. </p>

<p>8. IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ON PREVENTING HIV
INFECTION </p>

<p>A major question in the policy debate over NEPs is their
effectiveness in preventing-HIV infection among IDU-s-and-their
contacts. Several findings strongly support the conclusion that
NEPs reduce HIV transmission. First, the process of needle
exchange removes used, often HIV-contaminated, needles and
syringes from the hands of IDUs and replaces them with sterile
needles and syringes. Second, NEPs are often effective in
referring NEP client and non-client IDUs to drug treatment
programs. Third, NEP clients report decreases in their HIV drug
risk behaviors. Fourth, mathematical models of the impact of NEPs
in New Haven and other cities consistently estimate substantial
reductions (ranging from 17 to 70 percent) in HIV transmission
for the IDUs using NEPs and their sex partners and children.
Fifth, there is some evidence that hepatitis B infection is
reduced by NEPs. On the other hand, epidemiologic studies which
directly address HIV prevalence and incidence in relation to NEPs
have been methodologically weak. One case-control study (in
Amsterdam) found no protective effect of the NEP on HIV
seroconversion among IDUs. However, the Amsterdam study was not
primarily designed to test NEP effectiveness and included only a
limited number (31) of new HIV infections. We concur with the UC
conclusion that the relationship between NEPs and HIV infection
may be very difficult to determine conclusively. </p>

<p>9. REVIEW OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p>In this section, the recommendations of the UC study are
reviewed. </p>

<p>&quot;Recommendations for the federal government </p>

<p>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services. </p>

<p>Substantial federal funds should be committed both to
providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into
these programs. </p>

<p>CDC comment: </p>

<p>Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate with the
minor modifications indicated in this section. </p>

<p>Given the significance of injection drug use in HIV
transmission in the United States, it is important to implement
NEPs as one possible component of comprehensive HIV prevention
programs for drug users. Comprehensive programs should include
increases in drug treatment, street and community outreach to
drug users, and effective school and community-based programs to
prevent initiation of drug use. The ban on Federal funding of
NEP-s should be removed-to allow States-and-communities the
option of including NEPs in comprehensive programs. NEPs will be
more readily integrated into comprehensive programs when there is
evidence of substantial local support for NEPs as indicated by
any of the following: requests for an NEP from a State or local
HIV community planning process; substantial funding for NEPs from
local and/or State government or nongovernmental organizations;
and efforts to reform the laws limiting the sale or possession of
needles and syringes. </p>

<p>The PHS should fund additional evaluations of NEPs[8] to
gather more data on the impact of these programs and to assess
the relative effectiveness of various models of delivery of NEP
services. Additional research is needed on the initiation of drug
use and drug injection and changes in community drug use,
particularly in communities with high prevalence of drug use, as
they relate to NEPs and other interventions that increase the
availability of sterile needles and syringes. PHS agencies
supporting research on NEPs should develop and promote the use of
standardized data elements, methods of data collection, and
protocols for evaluation and analysis. </p>

<p>State governments in the ten states and the District of
Columbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws. </p>

<p>- States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to
syringes. </p>

<p>CDC comment: </p>

<p>Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate with the
modifications indicated in this section. </p>

<p>Although the major focus of the UC report was NEPs, there is
ample evidence of the importance of allowing access to sterile
needles and syringes for drug users who will not or cannot stop
injecting drugs. In the United States and other countries,
difficulty in obtaining and/or possessing needles and syringes
contributes to multiperson use of needles and syringes and
thereby to HIV transmission. NEPs can provide only a part of the
increased access to needles and syringes that is needed to
prevent HIV infection in IDUs, their sex partners and children.
Changing the prescription and paraphernalia laws would increase
IDU access to sterile needles and syringes with little or no
expenditure of public funds. </p>

<p>An ongoing CDC and Connecticut evaluation of 1992 changes in
the prescription and drug paraphernalia laws in Connecticut[9]
provides convincing evidence of the potential benefit of these
recommendations. The evaluation found (1) steady increases of
&quot;non-prescription&quot; purchases of needles and syringes
from pharmacies, (2) that IDUs reported their primary source of
needles and syringes shifted from street/black-market purchases
to pharmacy purchases and (3) that sharing (&quot;multiperson
use&quot;) of needles and syringes decreased from 52 percent
prior to the new laws to 32 percent 8 to 12 months after the new
laws were implemented. Similar increases in pharmacy purchases
and decreases in sharing of needles and syringes were found in
France after a prescription law was repealed in 1987. </p>

<p>[9]In 1992, Connecticut removed all criminal penalties for (a)
the sale, without a prescription, of up to 10 needles and
syringes and (b) the possession of up to 10 needles and syringes.
</p>

<p>The implementation of these recommendations is primarily the
responsibility of State governments. We recommend that the
Federal government and others support strong evaluation studies
of the impact of changes in these laws on drug use patterns and
HIV transmission risk behaviors. The use of standardized research
methods yielding comparable results should be encouraged. </p>

<p>&quot;Recommendations for local governments and communities </p>

<p>Local governments should enter into discussions with local
community groups to develop a comprehensive approach to
preventing HIV in injection drug users. their sex partners. and
their offspring. This approach should include needle exchange
programs and the expansion of drug treatment services. </p>

<p>Local communities should seek to further increase sterile
syringe availability by encouraging the sale, distribution. or
exchange of syringes by pharmacists.&quot; </p>

<p>CDC comment: </p>

<p>Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate. </p>

<p>The experience with implementing NEPs in the United States and
other countries indicates that NEPs are better accepted and
operate more efficiently when there is extensive community
involvement in planning how the NEP services will be provided.
NEPs should be components of comprehensive, multifaceted HIV
prevention programs for IDUs. </p>

<p>Pharmacy sale of sterile needles and syringes is-an--important
component in increasing the availability of sterile injection
equipment to IDUs. Retail pharmacies could provide widespread
access to sterile needles and syringes, especially in areas where
NEPs would be impractical (e.g., rural areas). Pharmacists are
important &quot;gate keepers&quot; for the availability of
sterile needles and syringes. Many pharmacists will need training
to realize the importance of their public health role in helping
ensure the availability of sterile needles and syringes to IDUs. </p>

<p>10 . INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF STERILE NEEDLES AND
SYRINGES </p>

<p>CDC believes that increasing the availability of sterile
needles and syringes is appropriate Federal policy for the
following reasons: </p>

<p>(1) HIV transmission associated with injection drug use is a
major contributor to the growth of the current AIDS epidemic in
the United States. Injection-related HIV transmission has caused
increases in the number of AIDS cases among women and children,
in heterosexually acquired HIV infections and in cases of
tuberculosis. </p>

<p>(2) Restrictions on access to and the possession of needles
and syringes increase the multiperson use (&quot;sharing&quot;)
of drug injection equipment that transmits HIV. </p>

<p>(3) A recent bulletin from the CDC, NIDA, and CSAT indicates
that bleach disinfection of used drug injection equipment is not
as safe as using sterile needles and syringes. Such disinfection
is recommended only when sterile needles and syringes are not
available. </p>

<p>(4) Evaluation of NEPs in the United States and other
countries indicates that these programs can provide services to
large numbers of IDUs, remove millions of used needles and
syringes from circulation, and increase access to drug treatment
and other high priority public health services. </p>

<p>(5) The preponderance of evidence indicates that NEPs diminish
HIV transmission without increasing drug use. </p>

<p>(6) Evaluation of changes in the prescription and drug
paraphernalia laws in Connecticut indicates that drug users
change their usual source of needles and syringes from street and
&quot;black market&quot; purchases to purchases -from pharmacies
and substantially decrease sharing of injection equipment. </p>

<p>We recommend that the PHS adopt a policy goal of increasing
the availability of sterile needles and syringes for IDUs. This
specific HIV prevention strategy would be one component of
comprehensive, multifaceted HIV prevention programs for IDUs. The
following activities should be considered to implement this
policy: </p>

<p>Allow Federal funding of NEPs, especially when these NEPs
would also provide their clients with access to HIV counseling
and other priority public health programs (e.g., drug treatment
and tuberculosis screening and treatment). Programs that receive
Federal funding should have substantial evaluation and/or
research components, either as part of the project or as a
separately funded activity. </p>

<p>Continue funding for research and evaluation studies of the
impact of NEPs on HIV risk behaviors and HIV infection. </p>

<p>(1) the repeal of State laws requiring a physician's
prescription for the purchase of sterile needles and syringes,
(2) the repeal of State and municipal laws and regulations making
the possession of needles and syringes a crime, and 3) the
removal of needles and syringes from the list of materials
covered by the Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act.
Evaluations of the impact of these changes should be funded </p>

<p>Work with the professional associations of pharmacists and
pharmacies to develop policies that increase the pharmacy-based
availability of sterile needles and syringes. </p>

<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p>

<p>THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORT (THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT
OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p>How and Why did Needle Exchange Programs Develop? </p>

<p>Needle exchange programs have continued to increase in number
in the U.S. and by September 1, 1993 at least 37 active programs
exist. The evolution of needle exchange programs in the U.S. has
been characterized by growing efforts to accommodate the concerns
of local communities. increasing likelihood of being legal,
growing institutionalization, and increasing federal funding of
research, although a ban on federal funding for program services
remains in effect. </p>

<p>How do Needle Exchange Programs Operate? </p>

<p>About one-half of U.S. needle exchange programs are legal, but
funding is often unstable and most programs rely on volunteer
services to operate. All but six U.S. needle exchange programs
require one-for-one exchanges and rules governing the) exchange
of syringes are generally well enforced. In addition to having
distributed over 5.4 million syringes, U.S. needle exchange
programs provide a variety of services ranging from condom and
bleach distribution to drug treatment referrals. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Act as Bridges to Public Health
Services? </p>

<p>Some needle exchange programs have made significant numbers of
referrals to drug abuse treatment and other public health
services, but referrals are limited by the paucity of drug
treatment slots. Integrating needle exchange programs into the
existing public health system is a likely future direction for
these programs. </p>

<p>How Much Does It Cost to Operate Needle Exchange Programs? </p>

<p>The median annual budget of U.S. and Canadian needle exchange
programs visited is relatively low at $169,000, with
government-run programs tending to be more expensive. Some needle
exchange programs are more expensive because they also provide
substantial non-exchange services such as drug treatment
referrals. The annual cost of funding an average needle exchange
program would support about 60 methadone maintenance slots for
one year. </p>

<p>Who Are the IDUs who Use Needle Exchange Programs? </p>

<p>Although needle exchange program clients vary from location to
location, the programs generally reach a group of injection drug
users with long histories of drug injection who remain at
significant risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection. Needle exchange program clients in the U.S. have had
less exposure to drug abuse treatment than IDUs not using the
programs. </p>

<p>What Proportion of All Injection Drug Users in a Community
Uses the Needle Exchange Program? </p>

<p>Studies of adequately-funded needle exchange programs suggest
that the programs do have the potential to serve significant
proportions of the local injecting drug user population. While
some needle exchange programs appear to have reached large
proportions of local drug injectors at least once, others are
reaching only a small fraction of them. Consequently other
methods of increasing sterile needle availability must be
explored. </p>

<p>What Are the Community Responses to Needle Exchange Programs? </p>

<p>Unlike in many foreign countries, including Canada, proposals
to establish needle exchange programs in the U.S. have often
encountered strong opposition from a variety of different
communities. Consultation with affected communities can address
many of the concerns raised. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Result in Changes in Community
Levels of Drug Use? </p>

<p>Although quantitative data are difficult to-obtain, those
available provide no evidence that--needle exchange programs
increase the amount of drug use by needle exchange program
clients or change overall community levels of non injection and
injection drug use. This conclusion is supported by interviews
with needle exchange program clients and by injecting drug users
not using the programs who did not believe that increased needle
availability would increase drug use. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect the Number of Discarded
Syringes? </p>

<p>Needle exchange programs in the U.S. have not been shown to
increase the total number of discarded syringes and can be
expected to result in fewer discarded syringes. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect Rates of HIV drug and/or
Sex Risk Behaviors? </p>

<p>The majority of studies of needle exchange program clients
demonstrate decreased ratios of HIV drug risk behavior, but not
decreased ratios of HIV sex risk behavior. </p>

<p>What is the Role of Studies of Syringes in injection Drug Use
Research? </p>

<p>The limitations of using the testing of syringes-as a measure
of injecting drug users' behavior or behavior change can be
minimized by following syringe characteristics over time,. or by
comparing characteristics of syringes returned by needle exchange
program clients with those obtained from non-clients of the
program. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect Rates of Diseases Related
to Injection Drug Use Other than HIV? </p>

<p>Studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on
injection-related infectious diseases other than HIV provide
limited evidence that needle exchange programs are associated
with reductions in subcutaneous abscesses and hepatitis B among
injecting drug users. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect HIV Infection Rates? </p>

<p>Studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on HIV
infection rates do not and, in part due to the need for large
sample sizes and the multiple impediments to randomization,
probably cannot provide clear evidence that needle exchange
programs decrease HIV infection rates. However, needle exchange
programs do not appear to be associated with increased rates of
HIV infection. </p>

<p>Are Needle Exchange Programs Cost-effective in Preventing HIV
Infection? </p>

<p>Multiple mathematical models of needle exchange program impact
support the findings of the New Haven Model. These models suggest
that needle exchange programs can prevent significant numbers of
infections among clients of the programs, their drug an sex
partners, and their children. In almost ail cases, the cost per
HIV infection averted is far below the $119,000 lifetime cost of
treating an HIV-infected person. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p>Recommendations for the federal government </p>

<p>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services. </p>

<p>Substantial federal funds should be committed both to
providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into
these programs. </p>

<p>Recommendations for state governments </p>

<p>State governments in the ten states and the District of
Columbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws.[1]
</p>

<p>States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to
syringes.[2] </p>

<p>Recommendations for local governments and communities </p>

<p>Local governments should enter into discussions with local
community groups to develop a comprehensive approach to
preventing HIV in injecting drug users, their sex partners, and
their offspring. This approach should include needle exchange
programs and the expansion of drug treatment services </p>

<p>Local communities should seek to further increase sterile
syringe availability by encouraging the sale, distribution, or
exchange of syringes by pharmacists. </p>

<p>Recommendations for researchers </p>

<p>Descriptions of the &quot;kinetics&quot; and determinants of
needle use patterns: injection drug users sources of needles.
methods of disposal of needles, frequency of needle re-use, and
needle-sharing patterns. How do these change when a needle
exchange program or other changes in needle availability are
implemented? </p>

<p>Evaluations of &quot;natural experiments&quot; in which needle
availability laws </p>

<p>pharmacy based syringe sale, distribution, or exchange and to
identify the barriers to their participation. </p>

<p>Assessments of the effects of design features of needle
exchange programs (e.g., administering bodies, site
characteristics, opening hours, and program rules} upon process
measures of needle exchange programs (e.g., needles distributed,
drug treatment referrals discarding of needles). </p>

<p>Ethnographic and other qualitative research to assess the
factors involved in drug use initiation and in transitions
between various routes of drug use. </p>

<p>Case-control studies of the relationship between use of the
needle exchange program and acute hepatitis 8, particularly in
cities with active surveillance for the infection. </p>

<p>Large, multi-center case-control studies within existing
cohorts of injecting drug users to assess whether use of the
needle exchange program is associated with hepatitis B or HIV
seroconversion </p>

<p>Mathematical modeling using program data and behavior change
evaluations to determine which aspects of program design
determine effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. </p>

<p>[1]Prescription laws preclude the purchase of a syringe
without a prescription. limiting sterile syringe availability and
creating a risk of arrest for needle exchange program staff and
clients. </p>

<p>[2]Paraphernalia laws exist in 46 states and the District of
Columbia and preclude the possession or distribution or syringes
except for legitimate medical purposes. Conviction under a
paraphernalia law is a felony or a misdemeanor </p>

<p>Subject: Comments on the CDC's Draft Response on Needle
Exchange </p>

<p>We have reviewed the draft CDC response to the Office of the
Assistant Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General regarding
the University of California report on needle exchange. In
addition to the comments provided in our earlier review of the
report (included as Tab B in the CDC draft response), we provide
the following comments that are specific to the draft CDC
response letter: </p>

<p>1. Agency Position Issue </p>

<p>Page 1: The second paragraph implies that the NIH, along with
SAMHSA, HRSA, and the FDA, has provided &quot;recommendation for
needle exchange.&quot; This is either inaccurate or misleading.
We suggest that the wording &quot;And recommendations for needle
exchange&quot; be dropped from the sentence. </p>

<p>2. Research </p>

<p>The CDC draft response appropriately includes an emphasis on
the need for increasing research and evaluation of needle
exchange programs (NEPs) and other related aspects of HIV and
drug abuse. </p>

<p>However, in light of the reported gaps in information
concerning the efficacy and impact of needle exchange programs,
requiring evaluation to be an integral component of any federally
funded NEP becomes critical if we are to take an iterative
approach to this issue. </p>

<p>The following text changes are recommended: </p>

<p>Page 2: In the last sentence of the second paragraph the word
&quot;include&quot; should be change (sic) to
&quot;require&quot;; </p>

<p>Page 11: The first sentence of the last paragraph should be
&quot;The PHS should require substantial evaluation be part of
any federally funded NEP so as to continue to gather more data on
the impact...&quot;; and, </p>

<p>Page 15: The last sentence of the first paragraph should be
changed to read, &quot;Programs that receive Federal funding
should be required to have substantial evaluation and/or research
components, either as part of the project or as a separately
funded activity.&quot; </p>

<p>3. Agency Designation </p>

<p>Page 4: The fourth paragraph lists the CDC, CSAT and NIDA as
co-sponsors of a bleach use guidance. For parity , all agencies
should be designated. This could be achieved by indicating
CSAT/SAMHSA and NIDA/NIH, or by stating, &quot; The National
Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of
Health,...&quot; </p>

<p>Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions of
need further information. </p>

<p>SUBJECT: NIH comments on- the University of California Report,
</p>

<p>&quot; Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the
United States and Abroad. &quot; </p>

<p>We have reviewed the report, &quot;The Public Health Impact of
Needle Exchange Programs in the United states and Abroad, &quot;
from a research perspective, We have provided several points for
your consideration in your response on needle exchange to the
Assistant Secretary for Health: </p>

<p>1. This report is a good initial analysis of this issue and
serves as a useful starting point for further examination; </p>

<p>2. Utilizing needle/syringe exchange (NSE) programs as an HIV
prevention strategy is a complex issue. The current state of the
science with respect to this issue is neither complete nor
comprehensive, .requiring further study on this, as well as,
alternative behavioral interventions; </p>

<p>2. There are a number of significant issues and problems with
respect to needle exchange program that the data available to the
University of California have not addressed (see attached
analysis); </p>

<p>3. The report appropriately suggests a substantial federal
commitment to research in this area. Such support should include,
but should not be limited to, .funding for: 1) building
substantiai evaluation and/or research components into existing
NSEs; 2) research demonstration projects that address NSE
program: design issues; 3. research on other forms of
need~e/syringe distribution (e.g., pharmacy or vending machinP
strategies); and, 4) research on the relationships and impact of
NSEs on other prevention strategies (e.g., bleach use) and other
non-injecting at-risk populations (e.g., non-injecting drug users
who trade sex or money for drugs). In addition, until more is
definitively known and has been time tested, any NSE service
programs funded should have appropriate research and/or
evaluation components built into them as a prerequisite for
Federal funding. </p>

<p>For a more detailed analysis of the specific research issues
and questions that remain unanswered by the report, we have
attached comments on the report provided by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse. </p>

<p>Topic: Comments on University of California Report, &quot; The
Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United
States and Abroad&quot; </p>

<p>In general, medical/public health interventions, like
medications, may be evaluated within a framework that examines
safety, efficacy, side effects, deleterious effects and both
positive and negative interactions with other treatments or
conditions. With respect to any of the effects, questions include
what subpopulations are likely to experience the effect and how
long it is likely to last, including recommendations with respect
to the length of treatment. In fact, to the degree to which this
Report provides the equivalent of a section of the Physician's
Desk Reference(PDR) devoted to needle/syringe exchange (NSE) it
will be helpful all who are concerned with the implications of
NSEs. </p>

<p>Viewing this Report in the aforementioned framework it becomes
clear that with respect to overall &quot;effects&quot; NSE is
associated in the aggregate with reductions in self reports of
needle-related HIV risk behavior. </p>

<p>However, a major problem with the existing data examined by
the Report is the lack of sensitivity of the data to detection of
adverse effects of NSE on individuals or subpopulations and
interaction with, for example, the various modalities of drug
abuse treatment. There is no equivalent of studies that search
for individuals who purport to have experienced &quot;adverse
reactions&quot; or negative consequences or interactions that may
be attributable to participation in NSE. It is questionable
whether in the context of medications development the Federal
Government would approve and/or provide funds for a medication
for which this type of data were not available. </p>

<p>In the spirit of seeking the information that would be needed
for a complete PDR section on needle/syringe exchange, we will
review some concerns about the potential adverse impact and
interactions of NSE. </p>

<p>One major concern of critics of NSEs as an AIDS intervention
effort is the degree to which the availability of sterile
needles/syringes would server to promote drug use. While the
needle exchange studies reported from around the world from the
last two world AIDS conferences do not, and perhaps cannot, prove
that the presence and/or use of a needle exchange does not
increase drug use, there have been no reports that confirm such
an increase. However, there are a number of direct and indirect
ways in which drug use maybe promoted for individuals and
subpopulations that have not been addressed by existing data. For
example, one wonders what happens to the drug use of individuals
who seek drug treatment through an NSE and are told that there is
no slot available for them. </p>

<p>Analogous to that for needle/syringe exchange, the criticism
of the potential for increasing injection drug use was raised for
bleach distribution. This particular criticism (although not all
criticisms) with respect to bleach was, in the aggregate and
within limits, refuted by the results of the National AIDS
Demonstration Research data which is consistent with the model
that when contact is established with drug users, trust is build,
information is imparted and risky behavior is reduced, despite
the fact that safe needle use is also being assisted at the same
time(XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX). Nonetheless, the demonstration of
beneficial effects does not preclude the simultaneous existence
of deleterious effects. </p>

<p>NSEs may not be uniformly effective in acting as a bridge to
other public health services, depending on such factors as to
what degree the services are &quot;on-site&quot; versus
&quot;remote&quot; as well as &quot;immediately available&quot;
versus &quot;requiring waiting&quot;. Studies of the service
linkage process suggest that higher rates of successful
engagement with other services will be attained for those
services that are on-site and immediately available. It would be
useful to attempt to characterize users and non-users of
additional services and to delineate those factors that affect
these decisions. </p>

<p>Inconsistent of infrequent users of the NSEs may remain and be
stabilized at high risk behavior levels. With respect to the
inconsistent or infrequent users of the NSEs, it will be
important to determine the factors influencing periods of use
versus non-user. More over, looking at NSEs as an
&quot;innovation&quot; with respect to injection drug user, the
literature of models of [LINE LOST IN COPYING - Ed.] middle and
late adopters of NSEs may be useful in terms of delineating
populations with distinct patterns of motivations, risk factors
and responses to the NSEs. </p>

<p>Change or lack of change in the micro-structure, i.e.,
details, of behaviors associated with drug use may negate
beneficial effects of NSEs. In looking at drug risk behaviors, it
is important to attempt to assess whether NSEs affect rate of
sharing of cookers, cotton, water, etc. as well as such practices
as frontloading, backloading and booting. With respect to drug
risk behaviors it is thus important to examine NSE effects on
behavioral norms of (1) non-NSE-users and (2) drug using
non-injectors as well as (3) NSE users. </p>

<p>NSE users may sell paraphernalia or exchange it for drugs or
sex. In fact, the possibility should be examined that
non-injectors may use the NSEs as a source for paraphernalia that
may used in transactions with injectors. </p>

<p>The rate at which NSE users (versus NSE non-users) initiate
new injectors and influence other IDUs to utilize or not utilize
the NSE should be examined. Moreover, questions of the influence
of the NSE on injections frequency should be examined closely.
For individuals, the availability of clean paraphernalia may
remove one brake on increasing the frequency of injection. </p>

<p>Certainly, NSE effects on the number of IDUs entering drug
treatment need to be examined. However, the fate of IDUs who have
used the NSE prior to entry into drug treatment should also be
examined. NSE participants or injections drug users whose network
includes NSE participants may relapse to needle use and/or drop
out of drug treatment at a higher rate than NSE non-users. </p>

<p>NSE effects on social network may lead to problems. Since NSEs
imply a high rate of flow of IDUs through the neighborhood
surrounding the site, there may be a tendency for dealers,
operators of shooting galleries and/or crack houses and
prostitutes to relocate to the same area. If possible, these
effects and their implications should be assessed. The potential
effects of NSEs on setting up bridges between networks of IDUs in
high and low HIV seroprevalence neighborhoods should be examined.
If NSEs serve to create such bridges they would, especially
through inconsistent seropositive users, serve as conduits to
facilitate viral spread. If data are generated on local changes
in seroprevcalence and/or seroincidence over time in areas
surrounding NSEs, (including baseline levels prior to the
establishment of the NSE and changes during the growth of the
NSE), then some of these questions may be able to be addressed.
Data pertinent to the perceived effects of participation in the
NSE on the sexual, social and drug-using networks of the
individuals would also be helpful in beginning to address these
hypotheses. </p>

<p>Additional network effects may occur or existing network
effects may be potentiated if NSE sites are located close to drug
treatment programs (methadone or drug free programs), hospitals,
psychiatric facilities, homeless shelters or other facilities
that attract concentrations of individuals who are vulnerable to
initiating drug injections, relapsing to drug use or injections,
having sex with injections users or becoming victims of crime
associated with injections users. </p>

<p>As is addressed in the Report, the surveyed NSEs varied
greatly in along many parameters including estimates of the
proportions of injection drug users reached by the program, the
amount of education offered, the degree to which injection
equipment beyond needles/syringes were distributed, emphasis on
drug treatment referrals, costs, the extent of ongoing
evaluation, acceptance by the local community, legal
acceptance/tolerance, etc. These are major program design and
feasibility that could determine differences between highly
effective programs and those with a substantial negative impact.
Support for grams without consideration of these issues would be
the equivalent of support for all treatment programs in any area
in the absence of standards and quality assurance. </p>

<p>Finally, the interrelationships between NSEs and the use of
bleach need to be examined. For example, we have evidence that
even IDUs who use bleach tend to not use it effectively. Does the
existence of needles from NSEs decrease the probability that IDUs
will even attempt to use bleach if the share? Will they feel that
the needles are at least relatively safer and thus real that
bleach use is not necessary? Does the distribution of bleach
increase the probability that IDUs will share NSE distributed
needles? Are NSEs attempting to intervene in terms of education
with respect to bleach use? </p>

<p>This, of course is not an exhaustive list of questions or
issues, but is meant to represent a set of problems whose
existence has not been addressed by the data available to the
University of California study. </p>

<p>However, even in the absence of Federal Support, NSE is a
growing part of HIV prevention efforts. This Report appropriately
suggests a substantial Federal commitment to research in this
area. With respect to the funding of services, it appears
reasonable, as the Report suggests, that the ban on funding be
lifted. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, it would appear prudent in light of the
incomplete data and the aforementioned set of concerns that no
services e funded that do not included a substantial evaluation
component with appropriate instrumentation and methodologies to
identify adverse as well as beneficial contribution of these
programs to HIV and other infectious disease transmission and
drug use patterns. Perhaps as a prelude to defining standards for
Federal funding of NSE services, there should be funding for
incorporating evaluation in existing NSEs and setting up
research/demonstrations projects that address NSE program design
issues. </p>

<p>Beyond the issue of NSEs per se, the argument is made in this
Report in favor of immediate implementation of the entire variety
of interventions that increase the availability of sterile
needles/syringes, including pharmacy sales and the abolition of
prescription and paraphernalia laws. Given the stated priority of
the objective, presumably this support would extend to other
forms of needle/syringe distribution, e.g., vending machines like
those used in Europe. </p>

<p>While the objective appears reasonable, it would be helpful if
the Report addressed more of the complexities of this issue so
that sterile needle/syringes are not viewed as a &quot;magic
bullet&quot; that obviates the need to continue work on
behavioral interventions. For example, there have been extensive
observations of &quot;secondary sharing&quot; in which addicts in
groups use frontloading and backloading to distribute
&quot;cooked&quot; drugs to their syringes. In these situation if
an addict brings his/her own syringe, but has previously used the
syringe even once and engaged in &quot;booting&quot; (drawing
blood back into the syringe and reinjecting after initial
injection to make sure that any residual drug in the syringe is
used), blood may be distributed to others' syringes. Moreover,
contaminants of &quot;cookers', &quot;cotton&quot; and
&quot;rinse water&quot; may be similarly distributed. </p>

<p>Finally, all strategies for distributing needles/syringes may
not be equivalent. For example, it is questionable whether
pharmacies will provide other forms of injections equipment, HIV
education, HIV testing and counseling, referral to drug treatment
programs, on-site medical car, etc. Similarly, these service
would presumable not be available through such distribution
sources as vending machines. </p>

<p>NOTE TO: George Lewis </p>

<p>RE Comments on Needle Exchange Study </p>

<p>As you may be aware, Beny asked me to review this report
during the early of it's preparation earlier this year. While the
final summary report does reflect many of the changes we
recommended, there are several noteworthy areas which warrant
some attention. </p>

<p>Page 4, Paragraph 4. The report indicates that, &quot;although
NEPs may make referral to drug treatment an important part of
their services, they acknowledge that many IDUs, including some
in drug treatment programs, continue to inject drugs and share
injection equipment. They therefore seek to reduce the harm
associated with these practices...&quot;. While there may be some
injecting drug users in certain treatment modalities who continue
to inject drugs, the reference here implies that this practice
has more significance than the evidence warrants. More
importantly, the statement, in a somewhat convoluted fashion,
implies that referral to treatment in contrast to NEP does not
offer assurance that drug users will not inject drugs. </p>

<p>Page 11, Paragraph 5. The report notes that. NEPs vary greatly
with respect to the emphasis they place upon making referrals to
drug treatment and other public health services. This stems in
part from the desire to make the NEP &quot;user friendly&quot;,
the recognition that many active IDUs express no interest in
entering drug treatment, and the related belief that an over
emphasis on drug treatment could alienated potential NEP
clients.&quot; This assertion for which two literature references
are cited is a dangerously misleading generalization. First it is
unclear what the authors mean by &quot;user-friendly&quot;. This
implies that drug treatment is somehow not user friendly which is
clearly not the case. Secondly, the references to drug treatment
are based published papers which were published before OTI/CSAT
came into existence, a development which has had an enormous
effect on the nature and quality of national drug treatment
services. We must remember that many of staff of these NEPs are
only casually familiar with the various treatment modalities, the
behavioral characteristics of drug using populations and are
generally not qualified to make determinations about who is
interested in treatment or not. In point of fact many drug users
are not interested in treatment, enter treatment for many other
reasons, e.g. secure primary care or to take a respite from their
addiction lifestyle, other than to address their addictions. It
does not follow, even from the limited evidence provided in the
cited studies, that emphasizing or overemphasizing treatment
produces alienation. finally, the determination of who should be
referred or not should never be left to so-called perceptions of
staff regarding &quot;readiness for treatment&quot;. </p>

<p>Page 12, Conclusion. There are a number of reasons why
referrals to drug treatment are limited other than the paucity of
drug treatment slots. One important consideration which may be a
limiting factor to referrals may in fact have more to do with how
various NEPs have evolved in relation to drug treatment programs
in the same area. It is abundantly clear that these programs have
not been in philosophical agreement regarding how to address the
needs of the addict. </p>

<p>Page 13, Conclusion. I don't think there is any serious
disagreement that the cost of NEPs are substantially cheaper than
any form of treatment including methadone. It is also true that
NEP is cheaper than coronary angioplasty, renal dialysis and a
range of other health care expenditure. The reference made to
methadone seems to suggest that there is contrast, or perhaps
imply that there is tacit substitution effect. The reference made
to methadone should be deleted since its incorporation in the
context of the conclusion is largely irrelevant. </p>

<p>Page 14, Paragraph 5. Our understanding of injecting drug use
among women is not as well developed as for men. While there is
evidence which suggest that men initiate women, this is by no
means an absolute. the fact remains that there are IDU
populations of women which operate independently from those of
men. Our limited knowledge of injecting behaviors among women
clearly indicates that there may be other factors involved with
respect to injecting behavior which may make it problematic to
apply NEP directed at male IDUs to female IDUs. </p>

<p>Page 16, Conclusion. The conclusion tragically fails to
appreciate the full range of antipathy and fear which African
Americans communities have for the &quot;symbolic
sanctioning&quot; of drug abuse by endorsing NEP in their
communities. After years of &quot;Just Say No&quot;, the
perception of many leaders in these communities is that NEP
represents a step back and not forward. Irrespective of whether
this perception is valid or not, the presence of these compelling
beliefs cannot be dismissed lightly. It is insulting to these
communities, also contrary to all of our Public Health platitudes
around cultural sensitivity to dismiss these visceral community
concerns by stating that &quot;newer African American
organizations established specifically to address HIV prevention
generally support NEP as did several mayors...&quot; This
statement literally indicates that the view of traditional
leaders from the African American communities and from church
leaders can and should be ignored in favor of those who support
NEP. This statement by it's intent, fosters divisiveness and is
antithetical to efforts made by other segments of public health
including those concerned with preventing HIV disease to engage
and not alienate the African American community. </p>

<p>Page 18, Conclusion. The overall issue here is the question
which frames this section, &quot;Do NEPs result in changes in
community levels of drug use?&quot; Clearly this is very complex
question which could not be answered within the scope of the
study, but one which nonetheless warrants a poignant level of
inquiry. However, the conclusion seems to go beyond the paucity
of evidence to conclude that there is &quot;no evidence that NEPs
increase the amount of drug use by NEP clients or change overall
community levels of non-injection and injection drug use.&quot;
This convoluted logic would have us believe that if it cannot be
established that NEP has an effect on drug use, then the absence
of correlates, irrespective of methodological limitations, is
tantamount to saying it has no effect. This conclusion is further
supported by indicating that interview with NEP clients and by
IDUs not using NEP, confirmed that they did not believe that
increase needle availability would increase drug use. It is not
clear how these two groups would qualify to speculate on new
incidence, especially by younger members of the community. In
general, this ipso facto logic is not only distressing, but
raises very real questions overall scientific validity of this
report. </p>

<p>Page 21, Conclusion. Though the majority of studies cited
indicated a decreased rate of HIV drug risk behavior, the real
issue here which is not addressed are whether these behavioral
changes are sustainable overtime. While there are clearly
compelling finding of short term behavioral change, these
indications do not provide definitive conclusions regarding the
effectiveness of NEP overtime. The proper statement of this
conclusion should insert the caveat that the studies reviewed do
not conclusive evidence at this time that these behaviors are
sustained overtime. </p>

<p>We at HRSA have reviewed this very thorough report on needle
exchange programs and concur with its major finding and
recommendations. We believe that needle exchange programs
definitely have a place in what must necessarily be a
comprehensive approach to the prevention of HIV infection among
drug users. In addition, we were pleased that the report went
beyond needle exchange programs per se to discuss the need for
changes in current prescription and paraphernalia laws at the
State level. </p>

<p>Subject: Draft Response on Needle Exchange </p>

<p>To: James Curran, M.D., M.P.H. </p>

<p>Associate Director for HIV/AIDS, CDC </p>

<p>In general we think the CDC's draft response to Jo Ivey
Boufford, M.D. concerning the University of California report on
needle exchange programs did an excellent job of covering the
salient issues. We do have a number of specific comments, which
follow: </p>

<p>page 2, paragraph 2: </p>

<p>We suggest adding a sentence to the effect that :
&quot;Substance abuse treatment programs also require substantial
funding increases in order to accommodate the needs of
individuals who decide they want to enter treatment as a result
of their involvement in needle exchange and other outreach
efforts to IDUs. </p>

<p>page 7, first paragraph: </p>

<p>We think it is important to mention the fact that needle
exchange remains an issue of special concern issue among
African-American and other minority politicians and community
leaders. Whether or not we think this concern is justified, we
need to acknowledge that it exists. </p>

<p>page 8, last paragraph: </p>

<p>We think it should be acknowledged that the degree to which
new HIV infections are reduced is strongly affected by (1) the
&quot;penetration&quot; of needle exchange in a particular city
and (2) the complexity of the drug-using populations and network
in particular communities (i.e., the number of, and kinds of
connections between, drug injection networks). </p>

<p>page 9, &quot;Impact of Needle Exchange Programs on Drug
Use&quot;: </p>

<p>Again, we think it is crucial to acknowledge and discuss the
fact that many African-American and other minority politicians
and community leaders fear that needle exchange programs condone
drug use and should be opposed on those grounds. </p>

<p>The last paragraph in this section should provide more
specific data to address this concern. </p>

<p>page 10, last paragraph: </p>

<p>The fifth sentence should read, &quot;Third, NEP clients
report decreases in their HIV drug-risk behaviors.&quot; </p>

<p>We disagree that the relationship between NEPs and HIV
infection may be impossible to study conclusively, particularly
since &quot;conclusiveness&quot; depends on the criteria being
used. This issue could be studied with several replications
(different cities or neighborhoods) to obtain better data than
now exist on this point. </p>

<p>page 11, last paragraph: </p>

<p>We suggest adding a sentence to the effect that, &quot;The CDC
should develop and foster the use of standardized data elements,
methods of data collection, and protocols for
evaluation/analysis.&quot; </p>

<p>page 12 first paragraph: </p>

<p>In the last sentence, we suggest adding the phrase,
&quot;using standardized methodologies.&quot; </p>

<p>page 15, first paragraph: </p>

<p>Again, we suggest adding to the last sentence's phrase about
the use of standardized data collection and evaluation
methodologies. </p>

<p>We appreciate the opportunity to review this response. </p>

<p>Office of the Associate Director for HIV/AIDS </p>

<p>To: Associate Director for HIV/AIDS </p>

<p>Re: Request for Update on Needle Exchange Studies and Laws
Related to Needle and Syringe Sale and/or Possession </p>

<p>1. Background </p>

<p>The following information is provided in response to the
request of Brian Biles, Office of the Assistant Secretary for
Health, for an update on (a) studies of needle exchange programs
(NEPs) since the 1993 release of the University of California
(UC) three-volume, 700 page report on NEPs[1] and (b) recent
developments related to laws related to NEPs and possessions
and/pr sale of syringes. </p>

<p>2. New York City NEP evaluation reported at 1994 APHA
Conference </p>

<p>* At the 1994 American Public Health Association (APHA)
Conference, Dr. Don Des Jarlais presented and estimate of an
approximate 50% reduction in rates of new HIV infections among
injecting drug users (IDUs) using NEPs in New York City (NYC). </p>

<p>* This estimate was based on several small follow-up studies
of HIV incidence among IDUs using NEPs compared to HIV incidence
among IDUs in a vaccine preparedness cohort and cohort studies in
methadone maintenance.[2] A manuscript based the APHA oral
presentation is being prepared. Until this study is more fully
described, it is difficult to assess the basis for this estimate
of NEP impacting NYC. However, although the numbers are small,
the estimate is plausible. </p>

<p>3. Legal aspects of needle exchange, possession, and sale of
syringes </p>

<p>* In 1993 and 1994, three states (Maryland, Massachusetts, and
Rhode Island) enacted laws authorizing pilot NEPs; two states
(Connecticut and Hawaii) enacted laws expanding existing NEP
legislation. </p>

<p>* In September 1994, the Mayor and City Council o Los Angeles
declared a &quot;local state of emergency.&quot; The declaration
was based on &quot;... finding that an emergency in connection
with the AIDS epidemic and the transmission of HIV through
contaminated needles does exist, and that this emergency
threatens to cause extraordinary loss of life.&quot;[3] This
state of emergency was used as a basis for authorizing support
for &quot;responsible&quot; NEPs. </p>

<p>* In 1993 and 1994, similar declarations of states of
emergency have been made in nine other California cities and
counties - Alameda, Berkeley, Marin, Oakland, Salinas, San
Francisco, Santa Clara, Sonoma, and West Hollywood. </p>

<p>* A major reason for NEPs is the existence of several laws
that restrict the purchase, distribution, and possession of
syringes. These laws include &quot;prescription laws,&quot; under
which a prescription is required to purchase syringes and
&quot;drug paraphernalia laws,&quot; which establish felony
and/or misdemeanor criminal penalties for the possession and/or
distribution of syringes for nonmedical purposes. About nine
states have prescription laws and more than 40 states have drug
paraphernalia laws. In 1993, Maine repealed its prescription law.
</p>

<p>* In 1992, Connecticut partially repealed it drug
paraphernalia and prescription laws. The new laws allow purchase
of as many as 10 syringes without a prescription and possession
of as many as 10 syringes without a medical condition. A CDC and
Connecticut Health Department evaluation of the impact of these
new laws found that IDUs reported substantially less multiperson
use (&quot;sharing&quot;) of injection equipment. Also, after the
change in the laws, more than 80% of Connecticut pharmacies sell
syringes without a prescription and, for drug injectors, there
was a dramatic shift from &quot;black market&quot; sources of
syringes to purchases in pharmacies[4]. </p>

<p>4. Limitations of bleach disinfection and recommendation to
use sterile syringes </p>

<p>Several studies published in a special section of the July
1994 &quot;Journal of AIDS&quot; indicate that while bleach
disinfection can reduce the HIV transmission risk of IDU reuse of
syringes, it is not as safe as using a new, sterile syringe. The
following quotation summarizes the argument: </p>

<p>We reiterate that IDUs who cannot stop injecting drugs should
use sterile needles and syringes; ideally only once and then
safely dispose of them. IDUs should be told never to re-use
injection equipment that had been previously used by someone
else.... If one re-uses injection equipment, consistent and
thorough cleaning of equipment with disinfectants, such as
full-strength household bleach for longer rather than shorter
periods of time, should decrease, but may not eliminate the HIV
transmission risk[5]. </p>

<p>The following sections present additional information on NEPs
that has become available since the release of the UC report. </p>

<p>5. Decreases in HIV risk behaviors among NEP clients </p>

<p>The following data from San Francisco and New York, cities
with high volume NEPs, indicate decreases in HIV risk behaviors
reported by NEP clients: </p>

<p>* Decrease in needle-sharing rates associated with increased
use of the NEP among street recruited San Francisco IDUs[6]. </p>

<p>* Reduction in needle-sharing rates among IDUs attending NEPs
in New York City[7]. </p>

<p>* Reductions in the proportions of IDUs attending drug
detoxification programs in New York City who injected with a use
syringe and who lent used syringes to others, associated with the
opening of NEPs in that city. </p>

<p>6. No evidence of an increase in drug use in San Francisco, a
city with a high-volume NEP </p>

<p>The San Francisco NEP opened in 1987. It is a now one of the
highest volume NEPs in the United States; 343,888 syringes were
exchanged during the Spring of 1992. The following data come from
repeated surveys (from 1988 to 1992) of IDUs in San Francisco: </p>

<p>* The median number of injections decreased from 1.9 per day
in the Fall of 1987 to 0.7 per day in the Spring of 1992.[6] </p>

<p>* The mean age of IDUs in the repeated surveys in San
Francisco increased from 36 years in the Spring of 1987 to 42
years in the Spring of 1992[6]. </p>

<p>* The proportion of San Francisco IDUs reporting that they
first injected drugs in the previous year decreased from 3.0% in
the Spring of 1989 to 1.1% in the Spring of 1992[6]. </p>

<p>Taken together, the last two finding suggest that significant
numbers of persons have not begun injecting drugs in a city with
a high-volume NEP. </p>

<p>7. Increase in estimated reduction of HIV incidence among IDUs
using the New Haven NEP </p>

<p>Earlier estimates derived from mathematical models indicated
that the rate of HIV infection among clients of the NEP in New
Haven, CT, was reduced by 33% by their use of the NEP. Updated
estimates from that model suggest that the reduction is more than
40%[9]. </p>

<p>8. Lower incidence of hepatitis B and C among IDUs using the
Tacoma NEP </p>

<p>A study of hepatitis B and C among IDUs in Tacoma, Washington,
using multivariate analysis to adjust for the demographic
characteristics of the IDUs found that, compared with nonusers of
the NEP, IDUs who had ever used the Tacoma NEP were seven times
less likely to become infected with hepatitis B and eight times
less likely to become infected with hepatitis C[10]. This study
demonstrates more clearly than any previous research that use of
NEPs is associated with decreases in blood -borne infections. </p>

<p>9. Substantial entry in to drug treatment of New Haven NEP
clients </p>

<p>Between September 1992 and July 1993, 112 of 596 NEP clients
(19%) in New Haven entered drug treatment. In addition, 205 IDUs
who did not exchange syringes were referred to drug treatment by
the NEP[11]. </p>

<p>10. Substantial IDU utilization of high-volume NEPs </p>

<p>One issue about NEPs is how much they will be used by IDUs.
Studies from tow cities with high-volume NEPs, New York City and
San Francisco, indicate that substantial proportions of IDUs
surveyed report use of the NEPs. </p>

<p>* Des Jarlais reported data indicating that in 1993 nearly
half (46%) of IDUs surveyed in New York City had used an NEP[2]. </p>

<p>* Surveys of IDUs in San Francisco in the Spring of 1992 found
that 45% &quot;usually&quot; obtained their syringes from the San
Francisco NEP[6]. </p>

<p>11. Increasing Number of NEPs in the United States </p>

<p>The UC report found at least 37 active NEPs in the United
States as of September 1993. As of October 1994, an estimated 70
NEPs were in operation in the United States[12]. </p>

<p>12. Support from the general public for NEPs for AIDS
prevention </p>

<p>In the first national opinion poll on NEPs, a 1994 national
telephone survey of 1,001 people, the majority (55%) of
respondents favored &quot;Implementing needle exchange programs
to reduce the spread of diseases such as AIDS.&quot;[13] </p>

<p>13. Support for federal funding of NEPs from the National
Academy of Sciences </p>

<p>A study on AIDS behavioral research published in 1994 by the
Institute of Medicine, described NEPs as &quot;highly
promising&quot; and called for the lifting of the ban on the use
of federal funds for NEP services. &quot;The weight of evidence
suggests that needle exchange does more good than harm,&quot;
concluded the authors[14]. </p>

<p>14. High HIV seroconversion among Montreal IDUs </p>

<p>The highest levels of HIV seroprevalence among IDUs in Canada
have been reported from Montreal. Bruneau reports from the St.
Luc IDU cohort that among 850 IDUs recruited 1989-1993, the half
(54%) reporting use of a Montreal NEP had higher HIV
seroprevalence (18.2% vs. 5.6%) compared with nonattenders. Among
the 507 IDUs with multiple visits to the study site, the
seroconversion rate was higher (11.6 vs 3.5 per 100 person-years
[p&lt;0.0001]) among IDUs using NEP[15]. </p>

<p>A study of incarcerated IDUs found that IDUs using a Montreal
NEP reported higher rates of HIV risk behaviors (vs. IDUs who did
not use a NEP). Montreal NEP attenders were more likely than
non-attenders, to have same sex partners, to work in the sex
industry, to report injecting with needles used by an
HIV-infected IDU, and re-use borrowed injection equipment without
cleaning[16]. </p>

<p>The higher HIV seroprevalence, HIV seroconversion, and HIV
risk factors among IDUs attending the Montreal NEP require
furthers study. </p>

<p>15. Comments and conclusions </p>

<p>Since the 1993 release of the UC report: </p>

<p>* The number of U.S. NEPs has increased, and more states and
localities have approved NEPs by legislation or declaration of
sates of emergency; </p>

<p>* In communities with high-volume NEPs, substantial
proportions of IDUs report using the NEP; </p>

<p>* Biological evidence suggests decreases of bloodborne virus
transmission among NEP clients, with the evidence stronger for
hepatitis than HIV; </p>

<p>* There is additional evidence that in most cities with NEPs,
NEP clients have lower rates of HIV risk behaviors; and </p>

<p>* Higher HIV seroconversion rates among IDUs using the
Montreal NEP were documented and must be further investigated. </p>

<p>Appendix IV </p>

<p>Legal Barriers to Federal Funding of Needle Exchange Programs </p>

<p>EXCERPTED FROM March 1993 report by General Accounting Office
(GAO), titled &quot;NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS -- Research Suggests
Promise as an AIDS Prevention Strategy. </p>

<p>Since 1988, Congress has passed at least six laws (in addition
to the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration
(ADAMHA) Reorganization Act of 1992) that contain provisions
prohibiting or restricting use of federal funding for needle
exchange programs and activities. These provisions are contained
in: </p>

<p>the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Amendments Act of 1988; the Health Omnibus Programs Extension of
1988; </p>

<p>the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of
1990; and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts of 1990,
1991, and 1993 (the Appropriations Act of 1992 did not contain
such a provision). </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Amendments Act of 1988 required states, as a condition for
receiving ADAMHA block grant funds under title XIX of the PHS
Act, to agree that funds would not be used to carry out any
programs of distributing sterile needles for the hypodermic
injection of any illegal drug or distributing bleach for the
purpose of cleansing needles for such hypodermic injection
....&quot; </p>

<p>This provision was repealed by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act
(1992). </p>

<p>The Health Omnibus Programs Extension of 1988 authorizes funds
and programs aimed at combating the AIDS epidemic and preventing
its transmission. Among other things, the act authorizes grants
and contracts through the Director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases to assist public and nonprofit
private entities in conducting research and training in advanced
diagnostic, prevention, and treatment methods for AIDS. These
grants may be used to operate demonstration projects in long-term
monitoring and outpatient treatment of HIV-infected individuals.
The act also authorizes funds for AIDS education. Additionally,
the Director of the National Institutes of Health is to establish
projects to promote cooperation among public health agencies and
with private entities in research concerned with the diagnosis,
prevention, and treatment of A[DS. The act provides further: </p>

<p>None of the funds provided under this Act or an amendment made
by this Act shall be used to provide individuals with hypodermic
needles or syringes so that such individuals may use illegal
drugs, unless the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service
determines that a demonstration needle exchange program would be
effective in reducing drug abuse and the risk that the public
will become infected with the etiologic agent for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.&quot; </p>

<p>The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of
l990 (42 U.S.C.  300ff et seq.) authorizes grants to localities
disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. The act
prohibits use of funds made available under this Act, or an
amendment made by this Act . . . to provide individuals with
hypodermic needles or syringes so that such individuals may use
illegal drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and
Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts of l990 and
1991 contained identical prohibitions regarding needle exchange
programs (section 520 of P.L. 101-166 and section 512 of P.L.
101-517). The provision stated: </p>

<p>None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to
carry out any program of distributing sterile needles for the
hypodermic injection of any illegal drug unless the President of
the United States certifies that such programs are effective in
stopping the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of
illegal drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>In contrast, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act
of 1993, states in section 514 of the General Provisions&quot;: </p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no funds
appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry out any
program of distributing sterile needles for the hypodermic
injection of any illegal drug unless the Surgeon General of the
United States determines that such programs are effective in
preventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of
illegal drugs, except that such funds may be used for such
purposes in furtherance of demonstrations or studies authorized
in the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (P L. 102-321).&quot; <br>

<p> Introduction </p>

<p> The Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control held a </p>

<p> 2day hearing in the 2d session of the 100th Congress to </p>

<p> examine the legalization of all illicit narcotics. </p>

<p> These informational hearings, entitled &quot;Legalization of </p>

<p> Illicit Drugs: Impact and Feasibility,&quot; were held in </p>

<p> response to public debate that began in early 1988, after </p>

<p> the mayor of Baltimore told a Washington, DC meeting of </p>

<p> the U.S. Conference of Mayors that existing U.S. drug </p>

<p> policy had failed. The mayor suggested legalization and </p>

<p> decriminalization as possible approaches to solving the </p>

<p> problem. </p>

<p> The hearings were designed to consider the seriousness of </p>

<p> a variety of legalization proposals that had been offered </p>

<p> by drug policy observers who, after the Baltimore mayor's </p>

<p> call for a look at legalization, stepped up their own </p>

<p> criticisms of U.S. antidrug policy. In effect, they </p>

<p> pronounced the symbolic war on drugs lost. </p>

<p> Now that the hearings have been completed, and testimony </p>

<p> has been studied and restudied, the committee, led by </p>

<p> Chairman Charles B. Rangel and Ranking Member Benjamin </p>

<p> Gilman, has produced a list of findings resulting from the </p>

<p> many hours of testimony. </p>

<p> The findings are not for any specific legislative purpose. </p>

<p> Instead, they are intended solely as an advisory to any </p>

<p> Members of the U.S. Congress and the public as to what the </p>

<p> committee believes was established by the proceedings. </p>

<p> How the Hearings Evolved </p>

<p> In the spring of 1988, Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke was </p>

<p> speaking to his colleagues at the U.S. Conference of </p>

<p> Mayors annual meeting on crime and drugs. During the </p>

<p> speech, Mayor Schmoke surprised the gathering when he </p>

<p> suggested that elected officials should consider the </p>

<p> legalization or the decriminalization of illicit drugs in </p>

<p> response to America's escalating drug crisis. </p>

<p> In his speech, Mayor Schmoke criticized America's current </p>

<p> antidrug approach as a wasteful proposition bent too far </p>

<p> toward law enforcement and not far enough toward treatment </p>

<p> and rehabilitation of drug addicts. Recalling his days as </p>

<p> a prosecuting attorney, Mayor Schmoke cited what he viewed </p>

<p> as the miniscule impact of arrests and convictions of drug </p>

<p> traffickers and drug users on the overall drug problem. </p>

<p> Schmoke's comments were the proverbial &quot;shots heard
around </p>

<p> the world,&quot; as few, if any, public officials had treaded
</p>

<p> into such politically explosive waters before on the </p>

<p> sensitive narcotics issue. </p>

<p> Select Committee Chairman Rangel (D-NY) responded almost </p>

<p> immediately to Mayor Schmoke's legalization calls. </p>

<p> Chairman Rangel decried the notion as stemming from </p>

<p> frustration and exhasperation with the Nation's </p>

<p> mushrooming drug crisis. Chairman Rangel contended in </p>

<p> interviews and opinion articles that legalization would be </p>

<p> a tactical error in the war on drugs that would quite </p>

<p> possibly lead to a nation full of drug addicts. </p>

<p> Throughout the ensuing months after the hearing was </p>

<p> announced, people on both sides of the issue began </p>

<p> tangling publicly over the question. An informal national </p>

<p> debate had begun, and many looked toward the hearings </p>

<p> scheduled by Chairman Rangel as a final commentary on the </p>

<p> subject at least for the time being. </p>

<p> in calling for the hearings, Chairman Rangel expressed a </p>

<p> desire to get to the heart of suggestions being proposed </p>

<p> by legalization proponents. Although pro-legalization </p>

<p> advocates claimed they were simply calling for a debate on </p>

<p> the issue, Chairman Rangel impressed upon them that they </p>

<p> should come forward with specific plans and proposals, </p>

<p> rather than just debate the subject. Chairman Rangel made </p>

<p> a special plea with public officials suggesting </p>

<p> legalization or decriminalization to come forward with </p>

<p> specifics to satisfy the burden of their responsibility to </p>

<p> the American public. </p>

<p> Throughout the debate, Chairman Rangel asked legalization </p>

<p> advocates a series of questions in order that they might </p>

<p> clarify their positions. Among them: </p>

<p> (1) has anybody ever considered which narcotic and </p>

<p> psychotropic drugs might be legalized? </p>

<p> (2) would we allow all drugs to become legally sold and </p>

<p> used, or would we select the most abused few, such as </p>

<p> cocaine, heroin, and marijuana? </p>

<p> (3) who would administer the dosages-the State or the </p>

<p> individual? </p>

<p> (4) what quantity of drugs would each individual be </p>

<p> allowed to get? </p>

<p> (5) what about addicts, would we not have to give them </p>

<p> more in order to satisfy their craving, or would we give </p>

<p> them enough just to whet their appetites? </p>

<p> (6) what do we do about those who are experimenting? Do </p>

<p> we sell them drugs, too, and encourage them to pick up the </p>

<p> habit? (7) furthermore, will the government establish tax- </p>

<p> supported facilities to sell these drugs? </p>

<p> (8) would we get the supply from the same foreign </p>

<p> countries that support our habit now, or would we create </p>

<p> our own internal sources? </p>

<p> (9) would there be an age limit on purchases, as is the </p>

<p> case with alcohol? </p>

<p> (10) how many people are projected to become addicts as a </p>

<p> result of legalization? </p>

<p> (11) what about pilots, railroad engineers, surgeons, </p>

<p> police, cross-country truckers and nuclear plant employees </p>

<p> who want to use marijuana and cocaine during off-duty </p>

<p> hours? </p>

<p> (12) what about crack cocaine as a legalized drug? Would </p>

<p> we want to legalize something as harmful and as </p>

<p> destructive to our youth as this? </p>

<p> Legalization: A Recurring Theme </p>

<p> The legalization debate seems to rise to the surface when </p>

<p> the drug crisis reaches alarming levels, as it has </p>

<p> recently. The drug issue eventually moved to the top of </p>

<p> the list of Americans' concerns during 1988, given the </p>

<p> spate of news stories on the growing influence of the </p>

<p> narcotics trade in everyday lives. </p>

<p> Throughout the year, there were revelations from the </p>

<p> Select Committee on Narcotics and other congressional </p>

<p> committees about the suspected involvement of some foreign </p>

<p> leaders in the drug trade. Americans were also bombarded </p>

<p> by reports of the increased prevalence of deadly, </p>

<p> addictive crack cocaine; growing gang involvement in the </p>

<p> narcotics trade; a tripling of cocaine imports to the </p>

<p> United States in the 1980's; a significant rise in drug- </p>

<p> related violence sparked by tension between warring </p>

<p> traffickers and by street dealers bent on attention- </p>

<p> getting retaliatory tactics. </p>

<p> At the time of the hearing, one major news poll revealed </p>

<p> that the American public was more concerned about the </p>

<p> crisis of illegal drugs than about any other issue- </p>

<p> including the budget deficit. </p>

<p> The ABC News polling data also indicated that Americans </p>

<p> were wary of legalization, Nine out of ten opposed </p>

<p> legalizing all drugs and about 50 percent of the </p>

<p> respondents feared drug use would rise under legalization. </p>

<p> In a Gallup survey released 2 months prior to the hearing, </p>

<p> about 75 percent of those surveyed were opposed and nearly </p>

<p> 70 percent felt that legalization would aggravate the </p>

<p> Nation's drug problem. </p>

<p> Through the years, advocates of legalization have favored </p>

<p> an end to existing drug laws, often using the end of </p>

<p> Prohibition in the 1930's and the end of organized crime's </p>

<p> involvement in the illegal liquor trade as an example in </p>

<p> making their case. </p>

<p> Chairman Rangel, on the other hand, asked of legalization </p>

<p> advocates in 1988: What drugs would we legalize? Who </p>

<p> would manufacture and distribute them? In what </p>

<p> neighborhoods would they be sold and marketed? Would </p>

<p> crack cocaine be legalized in a legalization scheme? </p>

<p> Would there be age and quantity limits on purchases? How </p>

<p> much would we give addicts, enough to satisfy their </p>

<p> craving? </p>

<p> Other opponents of the legalization theory suggested that </p>

<p> in addition to a potential meteoric rise in addictions, </p>

<p> there is no guarantee that the black market for drugs </p>

<p> would close down, especially if restrictions are placed on </p>

<p> purchase quantity and on the quality of various narcotic </p>

<p> substances. </p>

<p> Overview of the Proceedings </p>

<p> Thursday and Friday, September 29 and 30, 1988, were 2 </p>

<p> significant days in the 100th Congress regarding the drug </p>

<p> issue. In those 2 days, a total of 34 witnesses </p>

<p> representing Congress, law enforcement, government, </p>

<p> academia, and various drug-related interest groups </p>

<p> testified before the Select Committee on Narcotics on </p>

<p> legalization. </p>

<p> By the time the hearing commenced, the legalization issue </p>

<p> had gained such national exposure that the proceedings </p>

<p> were carried live over public television and public radio, </p>

<p> and was covered by a large contingent of print media. At </p>

<p> this point and time in 1988, legalization was a very </p>

<p> important topic to many Americans concerned about the </p>

<p> worsening drug crisis. </p>

<p> In addition to the announced lineup of witnesses, several </p>

<p> Members of Congress who do not serve on the Select </p>

<p> Committee on Narcotics offered testimony on the subject. </p>

<p> Representative Carroll Hubbard (D-KY) and Representative </p>

<p> Roy Dyson (D-MD) both told the panel that the Nation's </p>

<p> drug crisis had become more than just a problem in urban </p>

<p> America. In rural areas served by both those Members, </p>

<p> there has been a noticeable increase in narcotics-related </p>

<p> problems. Representative Benjamin Cardin (D-MD) warned </p>

<p> about the confused messages that would be sent to the </p>

<p> youth if drugs were legalized. Representative Kwesi Mfume </p>

<p> (D-MD) also outlined his opposition, but said that more </p>

<p> attention should be given to demand reduction. </p>

<p> Following is a summary of the statement of each witness. </p>

<p> The summary is intended to capture the essence of what the </p>

<p> witness presented to the panel in his or her opening </p>

<p> statement, and is not a verbatim translation of the actual </p>

<p> testimony. </p>

<p> Findings </p>

<p> 1. The ideas and recommendations of pro-legalization </p>

<p> forces remain varied and wide ranging. There is no </p>

<p> commonly agreed upon approach that should be taken to </p>

<p> legalize illicit narcotics. </p>

<p> 2. The American public remains largely opposed to the </p>

<p> notion of legalizing illicit drugs. </p>

<p> 3. There is no data to support the theory that </p>

<p> legalizing illicit drugs would result in less crime, more </p>

<p> affordable narcotics or decreased drug experimentation, </p>

<p> abuse or addiction. </p>

<p> 4. There is no agreement on the types of currently </p>

<p> illicit drugs that should be considered for </p>

<p> legalization. </p>

<p> 5. No definitive information exists that would show how </p>

<p> America's youth would be affected by legalization, whether </p>

<p> positively or negatively. </p>

<p> 6. There should be a stepped up effort to look at the </p>

<p> expansion of treatment and rehabilitation resources around </p>

<p> the country. </p>

<p> 7. The Federal war on drugs must devote more resources </p>

<p> to curbing drug trafficking and abuse in major U.S. </p>

<p> cities. </p>

<p> 8. Narcotics law enforcement efforts need to be </p>

<p> improved, especially in major U.S. cities) </p>

<p> 9. Training for the staff of drug abuse treatment </p>

<p> centers needs to be expanded and improved. </p>

<p> 10. Federal drug abuse policies need more input from </p>

<p> residents of major American cities and not just from </p>

<p> governmental leaders,police chiefs, and substance abuse </p>

<p> professionals. </p>

<p> 11. The burden of proof regarding the benefits of drug </p>

<p> legalization must be placed on the advocates of such a </p>

<p> policy. Until the proponents of drug legalization can </p>

<p> demonstrate that the benefits of such a policy outweigh </p>

<p> the risks to health and drug-related violeiiee, drug </p>

<p> legalization should be rejected. </p>

<p> 12. American schools should continue to convey the </p>

<p> message that drug abuse is against the law, harmful to </p>

<p> health, and a detriment to optimal academic performance. </p>

<p> 13. Employee assistance programs [EAP's] in government </p>

<p> and industry must be strengthened to help employees and </p>

<p> their families deal effectively with drug abuse, </p>

<p> 14. We have not yet begun to fight the war. </p>

<p> Consequently, legalization should not be considered an </p>

<p> alternative. </p>

<p> Summary of Statements by Members of Congress </p>

<p> CHAIRMAN CHARLES B. RANGEL (D-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROT. </p>

<p> Legalization has been widely discussed in academic </p>

<p> settings, and on radio and TV talk shows. But this is the </p>

<p> first time in a long time the issue has made its way to </p>

<p> the Congress. </p>

<p> Most of those who have been advocating legalization have </p>

<p> been calling for either a debate, a discussion or a </p>

<p> consideration. But after an advance reading of some of </p>

<p> the testimony, it does not appear that any of the </p>

<p> witnesses are truly'advocating legalization. </p>

<p> Some are saying legalization ought to be discussed because </p>

<p> the war on drugs is being lost with law enforcement. But </p>

<p> the Nation has yet to declare a real war on drugs. </p>

<p> For 8 years, the Congress has met resistance to antidrug </p>

<p> efforts. The Reagan administration has shied away from </p>

<p> providing funds to State and local governments so that </p>

<p> they can fight the war on drugs. </p>

<p> How can we say we have a war on drugs when a total of </p>

<p> 2,800 DEA men and women are dedicated to fighting the war </p>

<p> on drugs at the Federal level? </p>

<p> Some legalization proponents are calling for a greater </p>

<p> educational and rehabilitative commitment, but we do not </p>

<p> even have a single federally run rehabilitation program. </p>

<p> Some say we must do more with drug education, but so far </p>

<p> we have only had slogans like &quot;Just Say No&quot; and
&quot;Zero </p>

<p> Tolerance.&quot; </p>

<p> No opium or coca leaves are grown in this country, yet the </p>

<p> Secretary of State never utters his contempt for the </p>

<p> nations where these poisons are grown. </p>

<p> Legalization proponents must be prepared to discuss their </p>

<p> ideas and recommendations in detail. </p>

<p> HON. LAWRENCE COUGHLIN (R-PA), RANKING MINORITY MEMBER, </p>

<p> SELECT COMMITTEE: ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Having a hearing on legalization could send a wrong </p>

<p> message to America's young people that drugs are OK. </p>

<p> Having a discussion could be a copout in the war on drugs. </p>

<p> The hope is that the hearing will not be interpreted as an </p>

<p> indication that legalization is being suggested. </p>

<p> To quote the attorney general of Pennsylvania, Leroy </p>

<p> Zimmerman, &quot;In Philadelphia, over 50 percent of the
child </p>

<p> abuse fatalities involved parents who heavily used </p>

<p> cocaine. Cheaper, legal cocaine would result in more </p>

<p> children dying and more babies being born addicted.&quot; </p>

<p> HoN. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN (R-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Drug kingpins are Continuing to cash in on America's </p>

<p> insatiable appetite for illicit drugs. These </p>

<p> multinational criminal syndicates have built evil empires </p>

<p> from the drug trade. </p>

<p> The power of the drug trade threatens the authority of </p>

<p> governments worldwide. Colombia, for example, is </p>

<p> virtually under siege from the traffickers, </p>

<p> When the narcotics trade recently offered the Colombian </p>

<p> people the money to pay off the nation's foreign debt, the </p>

<p> people refused, resisting the financial temptation and </p>

<p> opting to take the moral high ground. </p>

<p> Those calling for legalization in America are seeking to </p>

<p> compromise the same values and morals that remain at stake </p>

<p> in Colombia. They are looking to cut a deal with the drug </p>

<p> trade. </p>

<p> Legalization would not put an end to the international </p>

<p> cartels, who would figure out ways to adapt and penetrate </p>

<p> the U.S. market. It would not end drug-related crime, as </p>

<p> many addicts on the street would continue to commit </p>

<p> criminal acts because of impaired judgment and instability </p>

<p> from illicit drug use. </p>

<p> It is hoped that fresh, new ideas will emerge from the </p>

<p> hearings that will make the Nation more effective in the </p>

<p> war on drugs. </p>

<p> HON. FORTNEY H. (PETE) STARK (D-CA), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> In New York and Oakland, only about 10 percent of the </p>

<p> cocaine and heroin addicts are able to be treated for </p>

<p> their addictions. In both cities, people seeking drug </p>

<p> treatment are required to wait at least 6 months for </p>

<p> treatment. Drug-related crime has skyrocketed as a result </p>

<p> of a lack of treatment slots. </p>

<p> Legalization is not the answer. We must find a way to </p>

<p> treat the drug abuser. </p>

<p> I am introducing a bill to provide treatment for addicts </p>

<p> seeking help. The bill would be financed through the </p>

<p> Social Security Programs' disability insurance provisions </p>

<p> and utilize a Medicare-like payment principal for </p>

<p> outpatient and inpatient services. </p>

<p> HoN. JAMES H. SCHEUER(D-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The ultimate copout in the war on drugs is to stand pat </p>

<p> with the current ineffective drug control policy. Pumping </p>

<p> more resources into a transparently failed system would be </p>

<p> an admission of defeat in the war on drugs. </p>

<p> Our system has totally failed. If seizures, arrests, and </p>

<p> convictions are going up, then so is violence and </p>

<p> addiction. We must end the preoccupation with the </p>

<p> criminal justice aspect of the problem and focus more on </p>

<p> education and treatment. </p>

<p> A new system and a new strategy would involve changing </p>

<p> people's behavior. We have successfully changed attitudes </p>

<p> and behavior on alcohol and tobacco consumption. </p>

<p> The question is, How do we reduce the demand for drugs? </p>

<p> We need to examine the costs and benefits of police </p>

<p> crackdowns. We have to address a broad spectrum of </p>

<p> options and put substantially more resources into those </p>

<p> programs that really work. </p>

<p> HON. CARDISS COLLINS (D-IL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Drugs have been a problem for many years. It is one of </p>

<p> the greatest public evils in the United States. </p>

<p> The present administration has demonstrated a profound </p>

<p> lack of understanding on the drug issue. The First Lady </p>

<p> has told us to &quot;Just Say No,&quot; while the President
has said </p>

<p> no to an effective policy to rapidly eradicate drug crops </p>

<p> from society. </p>

<p> It seems incontrovertible that the immediate effect of </p>

<p> legalization would be rampant drug use. This would occur </p>

<p> for at least a short period, as the lion that has been </p>

<p> held captive for many years would be let out of the den. </p>

<p> Even if legalization were to have the desired effect, it </p>

<p> would not work until the lion became accustomed to the new </p>

<p> liberties. That could be a very long time, and the Nation </p>

<p> could not afford to wait. </p>

<p> Legalization could lead to a legal and constitutional </p>

<p> quagmire, in which the newly legal rights of individuals </p>

<p> must be merged with the obligation to protect society. </p>

<p> HON. DANIEL K. AKAKA (D-HI), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The issue is not whether we ought to sanction the use of </p>

<p> drugs, but whether legalization can break the stranglehold </p>

<p> that drugs have had on our communities. </p>

<p> We have contended that drugs affect all of us, not just </p>

<p> users and pushers. That has never been more apparent than </p>

<p> it is today. </p>

<p> HON. FRANK J. GUARINI (D-NJ), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Legalization is not the cure for the Nation's drug </p>

<p> problems. It is the wrong policy, and it sends the wrong </p>

<p> signal. It sends the signal to the drug lords that the </p>

<p> Nation has lost, and they have won. It tells America's </p>

<p> youth that the U.S. Government says yes to drugs. </p>

<p> People should be motivated so that they don't need drugs. </p>

<p> They need to be given something to believe in. A sense of </p>

<p> purpose and a spirit of idealism need to be renewed in </p>

<p> America. Hope and dreams should replace despair and </p>

<p> hunger. </p>

<p> There should be a dialog on the issue, as it may in the </p>

<p> long run contribute to bringing an end to the drug crisis. </p>

<p> HoN. DANTE B. FASCELL (D-FL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The fight against drugs must focus on interdiction, </p>

<p> education, and rehabilitation. We just passed an oninibus </p>

<p> drug bill in the House, but no matter how vigorously we </p>

<p> attack the problem, we must key on reducing demand. </p>

<p> The issue should be discussed, and all views should get a </p>

<p> fair hearing. But legalization and decriminalization are </p>

<p> not the solutions to the drug problem. </p>

<p> A clear connection has been established between crime and </p>

<p> drugs. While many individuals commit crimes to get drugs, </p>

<p> others who commit crimes are found to have used illicit </p>

<p> drugs just prior to the commission of the crime. </p>

<p> Legalization will compound the situation because drugs </p>

<p> will be easier to obtain. It sends a misguided and </p>

<p> contradictory signal. </p>

<p> If drugs were legalized, how would we be able to tell our </p>

<p> kids to stay off drugs? How can we urge other countries </p>

<p> to work with us in interdiction and eradication efforts? </p>

<p> We must increase aid to State and local law agencies. </p>

<p> Efforts must be concentrated on interdiction, demand </p>

<p> reduction, and on rehabilitation and education. </p>

<p> HON. WILLIAM J. HUGHES (D-NJ), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> I am very much opposed to legalization. This view comes </p>

<p> after reflecting on 24 years as either a prosecutor or a </p>

<p> Member of Congress. </p>

<p> Where in the entire world has legalization worked? </p>

<p> Witnesses would do well to indicate this to the committee </p>

<p> in testimony. Also, indicate to the committee how the </p>

<p> profits are going to be removed from the drug trade under </p>

<p> legalization. The black market will not be eliminated. </p>

<p> Policies of recent years are workable if they are followed </p>

<p> with the proper commitment. To date, the commitment has </p>

<p> not been made in terms of effort and resources. </p>

<p> The Nation's strategy is good. Many of the provisions in </p>

<p> the omnibus drug bill advance us in the right direction. </p>

<p> Once the Nation gets serious about the problem, we will </p>

<p> begin to turn the corner. </p>

<p> HoN. SOLOMON P. ORTIZ (D-TX), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Drugs take away the God-given gift of human potential that </p>

<p> we all have. Illegal drugs are damaging our children, our </p>

<p> communities and our Nation as a whole. None of this would </p>

<p> change under legalization. </p>

<p> The question of legalization is not one of economics or </p>

<p> money or the black market. </p>

<p> The position of those who advocate legalization is </p>

<p> recognized. But when reasonable people discuss </p>

<p> unreasonable proposals, it is a sad commentary on the </p>

<p> impact that illegal drugs have had on society. </p>

<p> HoN. KWEISI MFUMF (D-MD), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> I am extremely opposed to the concept of legalization. </p>

<p> However, it is important that the debate take place. </p>

<p> Both sides in the debate agree on one thing: Illicit drugs </p>

<p> are tearing our Nation apart. It is estimated that some </p>

<p> 23 million Americans use illicit drugs once monthly. A </p>

<p> total of 6 million of these people use cocaine. Young </p>

<p> people in the United States use illicit drugs more than </p>

<p> their counterparts in any other nation of the world. </p>

<p> Proponents argue that legalization would remove the profit </p>

<p> motive. That may very well be, but drug use is driven by </p>

<p> demand and that's where more attention needs to be focused </p>

<p> nationally. </p>

<p> History shows that drugs made legal for adult consumption </p>

<p> cannot be kept out of the hands of children. Under </p>

<p> legalization, more children and young people would </p>

<p> experiment with drugs, as is the case with alcohol. It </p>

<p> has been estimated that about 75 percent of all drug users </p>

<p> become addicted. </p>

<p> Proponents often point to England and Holland as models </p>

<p> for a legalization proposal. But the concept has not </p>

<p> worked in either of those two countries. The policy of </p>

<p> legalized heroin had to be discontinued in England as the </p>

<p> number of heroin users increased and the black market </p>

<p> continued to thrive. In Amsterdam, Holland, where </p>

<p> marijuana is legal, crime and hard drug use remains a </p>

<p> problem. </p>

<p> An additional consideration is the threat of babies born </p>

<p> to drugaddicted mothers. That probably would be </p>

<p> exacerbated under legalization. So would other problems, </p>

<p> such as car and train accidents and corruption. </p>

<p> The U.S. focus on eliminating the drug problem should </p>

<p> expand beyond the one-dimensional effort to stop the </p>

<p> supply. More focus should be placed on demand reduction, </p>

<p> specifically treatment and rehabilitation. </p>

<p> If the United States is fighting a war on drugs, the </p>

<p> battlefields are not in Colombia and Bolivia, but rather </p>

<p> in our schools and our communities. </p>

<p> HON. MICHAEL OXLEY (R-OH), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The idea of legalization should not even be dignified with </p>

<p> a 2-day hearing by the committee. </p>

<p> Consideration of the notion of legalization sends a bad </p>

<p> message to the rest of the Nation and to the rest of the </p>

<p> world. America's teenagers who may be considering </p>

<p> experimenting with drugs may see that legalization is </p>

<p> being considered and think that it is now OK to use drugs. </p>

<p> Legalization is unacceptable in a civilized society. </p>

<p> My hope for an outcome to the hearings is that the book on </p>

<p> legalization will be closed once and for all. </p>

<p> HON. Tom LEWIS (R-FL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE </p>

<p> AND CONTROL </p>

<p> It is contradictory that those committed to fighting drugs </p>

<p> have agreed to give a hearing to the legalization issue. </p>

<p> Making drugs more affordable and more available could be </p>

<p> detrimental to society. Particularly objectionable is the </p>

<p> view of legalization advocates that the government itself </p>

<p> can make a profit from the drug trade. </p>

<p> Legalizing drug profits and making dealers out of the </p>

<p> government and private citizens is appalling. </p>

<p> HON. CARROLL HUBBARD, JR. (D-KY) </p>

<p> The urban drug problem is well known. But the war on </p>

<p> drugs needs to be fought in rural America, as well. The </p>

<p> drug problem is acute and serious in outlying areas. </p>

<p> In my own congressional district, in western Kentucky, the </p>

<p> U.S. Customs Service is aware of the severity of the drug </p>

<p> problem. They and the Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<p> know of contraband-carrying flights from Colombia and </p>

<p> Mexico that arrive at our rural airports. These small </p>

<p> airports are safer for drug dealers than flying into </p>

<p> places like New Orleans and Miami. </p>

<p> I hope that the Congress will be able to lead the public </p>

<p> and our government away from legalization. I hope that </p>

<p> those who are proposing legalization would realize that </p>

<p> more people would experiment with drugs under Such a plan. </p>

<p> In my district, even the schools are not immune to the </p>

<p> drug trade. At a grand jury hearing last December in </p>

<p> Bowling Green, I testified that there were individuals </p>

<p> selling drugs to Western Kentucky University students. My </p>

<p> wife and I received death threats as a result of my </p>

<p> testimony, in which names were revealed. </p>

<p> Like others, I wonder what we can do to increase education </p>

<p> about drug abuse, and move as a nation toward a spiritual, </p>

<p> rather than chemical, dependence. </p>

<p> HON. ROBERT GARCIA (D-NY) </p>

<p> Legalization poses dangerous repercussions for the Nation. </p>

<p> It cannot be risked. It could not be sustained. </p>

<p> The legalization proposal comes at a time when public </p>

<p> opinion toward drug abuse is beginning to take a turn for </p>

<p> the positive, and after the House has just passed major </p>

<p> antidrug legislation to improve on the 1986 antidrug bill. </p>

<p> Given the problems we continue to experience with tobacco </p>

<p> and alcohol, the risks of legalization are just too great. </p>

<p> The biggest concern about legalization is the effect that </p>

<p> it would have on America's youth. Legalization would </p>

<p> result in the widespread use of drugs, especially among </p>

<p> youth. The greatest impact would be felt in minority </p>

<p> communities and in the inner city. </p>

<p> As long as there are drug users who cannot afford drugs </p>

<p> legally, there will be a black market. Unless we legalize </p>

<p> all drugs-including crack, PCP, LSD-and unless we make </p>

<p> them universally available, there will be crime. </p>

<p> Legalization fails to take into account whether special </p>

<p> restrictions would have to be placed on pilots, law </p>

<p> officers, truck drivers and others in hazardous </p>

<p> occupations. It also fails to consider the spread of AIDS </p>

<p> through intravenous drug use. </p>

<p> HON. Roy DYSON (D-MD) </p>

<p> Legalization is a foolhardy and reckless proposal that </p>

<p> would have a negative impact on the family. </p>

<p> The drug problem has filtered down to rural America. In </p>

<p> one of the counties located in my district, the number of </p>

<p> drug offenses rose 114 percent from 1986 to 1987. </p>

<p> Activists like Timothy Leary, Alan Ginsberg and Jerry </p>

<p> Rubin 20 years ago advocated that drug use was okay and </p>

<p> should be accepted as a form of escapism from the rough </p>

<p> times of the real world. But over the past 20 years, we </p>

<p> have seen the personal and financial ruin that drug use </p>

<p> brings about. </p>

<p> Under legalization, America would become enslaved to </p>

<p> drugs. Decriminalization is simply a backdoor way of </p>

<p> legalizing narcotics. </p>

<p> Legalization would send a bad message. It would increase </p>

<p> drug use and addiction. It would result in the </p>

<p> expenditure of billions of additional dollars in health </p>

<p> care costs and in lost productivity. </p>

<p> We must begin teaching our children at an early age about </p>

<p> the dangers of harmful drugs. Though education must play </p>

<p> a vital role in our antidrug efforts, we must still </p>

<p> initiate stiff sanctions against those who grow, use and </p>

<p> sell illicit narcotics. </p>

<p> HoN. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN (D-MD) </p>

<p> In a survey of my Third Congressional District (portions </p>

<p> of Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Howard County), 69 </p>

<p> percent of the respondents oppose legalization and </p>

<p> decriminalization. </p>

<p> A war on drugs cannot be won unless the profit is taken </p>

<p> out of the drug trade. But decriminalization is not the </p>

<p> way to accomplish that. </p>

<p> Constituents are saying that our discussions on the </p>

<p> national drug debate should also take into account the </p>

<p> damage from other harmful substances, such as alcohol and </p>

<p> cigarettes. </p>

<p> More money should be focused on establishing effective </p>

<p> treatment and education programs if a real war on drugs is </p>

<p> going to be waged. </p>

<p> What is needed is a comprehensive approach combining </p>

<p> foreign and domestic policy sensitive to the urgency of </p>

<p> interdiction efforts, stricter enforcement, more resources </p>

<p> to educate our youth to the dangers of drugs and treatment </p>

<p> programs without waiting lists. </p>

<p> Summary of Testimony From Thursday, September 29, 1988 </p>

<p> MAYOR KURT L, SCHMOKE, BALTIMORE </p>

<p> America needs to reexamine its current drug policy. The </p>

<p> Nation is spending about $10 billion annually to enforce </p>

<p> drug laws that are catching only a fraction of the </p>

<p> violators. </p>

<p> The drug problem in America is defined in two components: </p>

<p> addiction and crime. Law enforcement is unable to resolve </p>

<p> either of these two problems and actually has worsened the </p>

<p> crime problem. The black market is a result of the </p>

<p> manufacture and sale of cocaine being criminalized and </p>

<p> profits from drug sale-, are enormous because the </p>

<p> substances cannot be obtained legally. </p>

<p> Nationwide, there were 750,000 drug arrests in 1987 and </p>

<p> Baltimore had 12,000 drug arrests, yet both represent only </p>

<p> a fraction of the drug violators. Prisons and jails are </p>

<p> packed with drug offenders, One-third of all Federal </p>

<p> prisoners are incarcerated on drug offenses. </p>

<p> Cigarettes kill hundreds of thousands, but no move has </p>

<p> been made to make them illegal. Antismoking campaigns and </p>

<p> other </p>

<p> Neither PCP nor LSD should be legalized. But a </p>

<p> maintenance system involving designated hospitals should </p>

<p> be implemented for cocaine and heroin abusers, with the </p>

<p> opportunity for abusers to enroll in a treatment program </p>

<p> aimed at reducing the intake of either of these drugs down </p>

<p> to zero. </p>

<p> MAYOR EDWARD I. KOCH OF NEW YORK CITY </p>

<p> Mayor Schmoke's proposal to maintain heroin and cocaine </p>

<p> addicts is not new. The concept has been tried in Great </p>

<p> Britain, and it has failed. Addiction and crime both rose </p>

<p> as a result of doctorprescribed drug maintenance in that </p>

<p> country. </p>

<p> Legally received cocaine could be turned into the </p>

<p> derivative crack by mixing in baking soda or some other </p>

<p> base in the heating process. This would be a </p>

<p> surreptitious way for crack addicts to obtain their fix if </p>

<p> cocaine and heroin were legalized and prescribed. </p>

<p> Organized crime still, would play a role in drug </p>

<p> production and distribution for those who are either </p>

<p> underage or cannot get the amount and quality they desire. </p>

<p> In Great Britain, 84 percent of the government-registered </p>

<p> addicts during that country's heroin maintenance program </p>

<p> were discovered to be using other drugs illicitly. </p>

<p> With a population of 240 million people and about 6 </p>

<p> million regular drug users in that group, drugs still </p>

<p> remain unacceptable and drug users remain a sizable </p>

<p> minority in the Nation. If legalization were to go into </p>

<p> effect, there would be a gradual acceptability that would </p>

<p> lead to an increase in users. </p>

<p> There is little distinction between decriminalization and </p>

<p> legalization, and both are bad ideas that should be </p>

<p> opposed. </p>

<p> MAYOR DENNIS CALLAHAN OF ANNAPOLIS, MD </p>

<p> The most compelling argument for not supporting the notion </p>

<p> of legalization comes from the problems our society </p>

<p> currently experiences with alcohol. According to the </p>

<p> Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, alcohol </p>

<p> abuse costs America about $117 billion annually in </p>

<p> medical, property, productivity and other losses. Of this </p>

<p> amount, only about $2,5 billion related to law enforcement </p>

<p> costs while the rest concerned accidents and other </p>

<p> problems associated with the abuse of alcohol. </p>

<p> Even marijuana should not be legalized. Advocates for </p>

<p> legalizing only this drug claim an overdose of it would </p>

<p> only put the user to sleep, but they could be asleep while </p>

<p> at the controls of a locomotive or another vehicle. </p>

<p> In Alaska, marijuana can be grown legally on private plots </p>

<p> and it can be consumed on the premises. A survey of </p>

<p> 250,000 high school students done by the Atlanta-based </p>

<p> organization, Parents' Resource Institute, indicates that </p>

<p> about one in five of those surveyed admitted to smoking </p>

<p> marijuana. About one in two of those surveyed in Alaska </p>

<p> admitted to smoking marijuana. It appears that the </p>

<p> sanctioning of marijuana use has contributed significantly </p>

<p> to the much higher usage figure in this State compared to </p>

<p> the rest of the Nation. </p>

<p> HoN. JACK LAWN, ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT </p>

<p> ADMINISTRATION </p>

<p> Drugs are not bad because they are illegal. Instead, </p>

<p> drugs are illegal because they are bad, and legalization </p>

<p> advocates are missing the point in blaming drug laws for </p>

<p> the crime and violence that has resulted from the Nation's </p>

<p> drug crisis. </p>

<p> The problems that we continue to experience with legalized </p>

<p> alcohol use provide strong evidence that legalization </p>

<p> would be a bad idea. Greater availability results in </p>

<p> greater use and greater abuse. </p>

<p> The National Council on Alcoholism reports that one of </p>

<p> every three American adults contends that alcohol has </p>

<p> brought them family trouble. About 100,000 10- and 11- </p>

<p> year-olds reported getting drunk once weekly in 1985, and </p>

<p> about 100,000 deaths a year in the United States can be </p>

<p> attributed to alcoholism. Of that number, 23,000 are </p>

<p> killed on highways and cirrhosis of the liver is the </p>

<p> sixthleading cause of death in America. </p>

<p> The United States is signatory to the Single Convention on </p>

<p> Drugs of 1961, and to the Convention of Psychotropic Drugs </p>

<p> of 1971. Both these treaties require the country to </p>

<p> establish and maintain effective controls on illicit </p>

<p> substances. The sanctity of these treaties and U.S. </p>

<p> credibility in the international right against drug abuse </p>

<p> would be severely damaged if these substances were </p>

<p> legalized. </p>

<p> Legalization would adversely affect.young people and the </p>

<p> crime rate. The American public has said in recent </p>

<p> opinion polls that it opposes legalization. </p>

<p> Legalization is a simple answer to a complex problem. The </p>

<p> answer in fighting the drug crisis comes from focusing </p>

<p> more on demand reduction efforts. </p>

<p> ARTHUR C. &quot;CAPPY&quot; EADS, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD,
NATIONAL </p>

<p> DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, 27TH </p>

<p> JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, BELTON, TX </p>

<p> The whole notion of legalizing drugs ignores the reason </p>

<p> why drugs were made illegal in the first place. They are </p>

<p> bad for the user, the community and society as a whole. </p>

<p> Drug use often translates into child neglect and abuse, </p>

<p> runaways, molestation and other crimes and maladies that </p>

<p> result from individuals being under the influence of </p>

<p> drugs. </p>

<p> It is wrong to assume that funding for enforcement versus </p>

<p> funding for treatment and rehabilitation are distinctly </p>

<p> different, and that they are competing categories, as both </p>

<p> areas must be adequately funded for an effective antidrug </p>

<p> strategy. Effective treatment programs are essential in </p>

<p> sentencing drug offenders, while sanctions against drug </p>

<p> use are critical components of a treatment and prevention </p>

<p> strategy. </p>

<p> We have yet to implement in the United States, a full- </p>

<p> scale attack on the drug problem combining law </p>

<p> enforcement, treatment and prevention efforts into an </p>

<p> effective strategy. </p>

<p> HON. STERLING JOHNSON, JR., SPECIAL NARCOTICS PROSECUTOR, </p>

<p> NEW YORK CITY </p>

<p> Calls for legalization are borne from frustration with an </p>

<p> inadequate response from the executive branch of the </p>

<p> government. Unfortunately, not one single piece of </p>

<p> antidrug legislation has come from the executive branch of </p>

<p> the government. The only major antidrug legislation has </p>

<p> come from Congress. </p>

<p> It is improbable that heroin addicts could be </p>

<p> maintained, as Mayor Schmoke contends. If an addict's </p>

<p> habit is maintained at a certain level, over time the </p>

<p> level of that addict's habit will rise. The black market </p>

<p> would remain in existence under legalization. Further, </p>

<p> the matter of whether doctors, pilots and other people in </p>

<p> sensitive occupations would be allowed to use legal drugs </p>

<p> must be examined closely. </p>

<p> Legalized drugs will not stop crime, and the experience </p>

<p> with prescribed heroin in Great Britain provides evidence </p>

<p> that a downward trend in crime is not necessarily the case </p>

<p> of lessened restrictions on drug use. </p>

<p> Finally, the concept of free needles, which is supported </p>

<p> by Mayor Schmoke and also New York Citv Mayor Koch, is a </p>

<p> bad idea. It sends out erroneous signals that conflict </p>

<p> with any and all efforts to put an end to the use of </p>

<p> harmful illicit drugs. </p>

<p> JERALD VAUGHN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL </p>

<p> ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE </p>

<p> The IACP represents more than 15,000 top-level law </p>

<p> enforcement executives in the United States. The group is </p>

<p> unequivocally opposed to drug legalization. </p>

<p> Overcrowded jails and prisons and loaded court dockets </p>

<p> indicate success, rather than failure, of law enforcement </p>

<p> in the battle against illicit drugs. Money is not being </p>

<p> wasted on law enforcement, as only 3 percent of all </p>

<p> expenditures at the Federal, State and local level involve </p>

<p> the civil and criminal justice system. A total of 1.4 </p>

<p> percent of Government spending goes toward the provision </p>

<p> of law enforcement services, and less than 1 percent of </p>

<p> the Federal budget is earmarked for law enforcement. </p>

<p> Less than 500,000 law enforcement officers are assigned to </p>

<p> protect more than 245 million American citizens, and the </p>

<p> lead antidrug agency has just 3,000 officers. </p>

<p> The IACP, in conjunction with the Justice Department, the </p>

<p> Bureau of Justice Assistance and DEA, called together law </p>

<p> enforcement authorities from all levels for five drug </p>

<p> strategy sessions in 1987. A major finding from those </p>

<p> sessions was that crime could be reduced through </p>

<p> cooperative community strategies. This information was </p>

<p> produced in manual form. </p>

<p> The United States has seen fit to protect Americans from </p>

<p> substances that may be harmful through the regulation of </p>

<p> the sale and distribution of these products. There has </p>

<p> lieen little complaint about the infringement on </p>

<p> individual rights in the process. It is understood that </p>

<p> these products-meats, milk, prescription drugs, serums and </p>

<p> vaccines-are regulated because the manufacturer alone </p>

<p> cannot be depended upon to put the interests of the </p>

<p> consumer ahead of the interests of profit. </p>

<p> Legalization is not a realistic option. At best, it is a </p>

<p> last resort when all else has truly failed. </p>

<p> WILLIAM CHAMBLISS, PH.D., PROFESSOR, GEORGE WASHINGTON </p>

<p> UNIVERSITY </p>

<p> The drug trade was estimated at about $1 billion a year 50 </p>

<p> years ago in 1938. Today, it is valued at somewhere </p>

<p> around $130 billion, which is larger than the gross </p>

<p> national product of most nations in the world and many </p>

<p> multinational corporations, </p>

<p> Drug profits remain essential to the survival of organized </p>

<p> crime. Churning out these profits and protecting them </p>

<p> involves engendering corruption of law enforcement </p>

<p> authorities, and this remains an ongoing goal of organized </p>

<p> crime, which remains a hazard of trying to stop the flow </p>

<p> and use of drugs by criminalizing it. </p>

<p> Because of the level of poverty and other factors, it is </p>

<p> impossible to expect a complete end to the drug trade even </p>

<p> if police were able to arrest each and every drug pusher </p>

<p> tomorrow. The costs of enforcing drug laws outweighs the </p>

<p> benefits, </p>

<p> A new drug policy should first take into account that </p>

<p> marijuana should be considered separately from such </p>

<p> substances as cocaine and heroin. States that have </p>

<p> decriminalized marijuana have had positive experiences as </p>

<p> a result. </p>

<p> Although the experiment with prescribed heroin in Great </p>

<p> Britain has not been totally successful, it is more </p>

<p> successful than what the United States has experienced </p>

<p> with criminalized heroin. Both heroin and cocaine should </p>

<p> be legalized and dispensed by medical professionals. </p>

<p> DR. CHARLES R. SCHUSTER, PH.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL </p>

<p> INSTITUTE </p>

<p> ON DRUG ABUSE </p>

<p> NIDA is strongly opposed to the legalization of illicit </p>

<p> narcotics. </p>

<p> First, there are a series of questions-including the many </p>

<p> posed by Chairman Rangel-that must be answered before we </p>

<p> can even begin to consider something as complicated as </p>

<p> legalization. For example, the pharmacological effects of </p>

<p> cocaine differ so that it is impossible to consider how </p>

<p> much would be considered enough, or a legal limit. </p>

<p> Second, there appears to be an attitude readjustment </p>

<p> occurring regarding drug abuse. According to the latest </p>

<p> national high school survey on drug abuse, drugs are being </p>

<p> seen by this group as more dangerous and there is a </p>

<p> reporting of more self-abstention from illicit drug use </p>

<p> than in other recent high school surveys. </p>

<p> In the 1980 survey, 11 percent of the respondents reported </p>

<p> daily marijuana use. The 1986-87 survey indicated that </p>

<p> figure had dropped to 3.3 percent. </p>

<p> As attitudes among adults and teenagers change, so will </p>

<p> behavior. What is also needed are more good treatment </p>

<p> programs, since we know that effective treatment works. </p>

<p> DR. ARNOLD TREBACH, PH.D., FOUNDER, DRUG POLICY INSTITUTE </p>

<p> America would be better off if all drug laws were removed </p>

<p> today. Americans are at their best when they negotiate </p>

<p> settlements, and at their worst when arguments are pushed </p>

<p> to the wall. </p>

<p> It is absolutely essential that we remove laws restricting </p>

<p> use of marijuana and heroin for medicinal purposes. It is </p>

<p> also important to begin viewing drug addicts from a </p>

<p> different perspective. We should be more concerned about </p>

<p> getting them treatment rather than branding them </p>

<p> criminals. This would include some form of maintenance, </p>

<p> which is admittedly controversial. </p>

<p> There should be limited experimentation with recreational </p>

<p> drugs. The 1973 Nixon Commission on Marijuana and Drug </p>

<p> Abuse as well as the 1982 report of the National Academy </p>

<p> of Sciences suggest an attempt at limited </p>

<p> decriminalization or legalization. </p>

<p> ADM. JAMES WATKINS, U.S. NAVV (RET.), CHAIRMAN, </p>

<p> PRESIDENT'S </p>

<p> AIDS COMMISSION </p>

<p> An emerging problem stemming from rampant drug abuse is </p>

<p> that of AIDS. One of the conduits of the deadly HIV virus </p>

<p> that leads to AIDS is contact with an individual who is an </p>

<p> abuser of drugs intravenously. </p>

<p> The IV drug abusers make up only 25 percent of all AIDS </p>

<p> victims, but about 70 percent of heterosexual native </p>

<p> citizens have contracted the disease from contact with an </p>

<p> intravenous drug abuser. About 70 percent of perinatal </p>

<p> AIDS cases involve a parent who is either an IV drug </p>

<p> abuser or who has a sexual partner who abuses drugs </p>

<p> intravenously. </p>

<p> More treatment is needed for IV drug abusers. There are </p>

<p> some 1.2 million IV drug abusers in the United States, but </p>

<p> only about 148,000 are in some form of treatment at any </p>

<p> given time. </p>

<p> What is needed is a full-scale effort that addresses both </p>

<p> supply and demand. </p>

<p> During its time as functioning body, the President's AIDS </p>

<p> Commission heard testimony regarding the use of needle </p>

<p> exchange programs. The overriding opinion of many black </p>

<p> leaders who testified at an inquiry held in New York City </p>

<p> is that IV drug abuse is killing the black community. </p>

<p> However, these same leaders were opposed to needle </p>

<p> exchange programs, and view them as a copout answer to a </p>

<p> very serious problem. They are considered the first step </p>

<p> to full-fledged legalization. </p>

<p> The most important thing that can be done to lick the drug </p>

<p> problem is to help young people avoid using drugs in the </p>

<p> first place. </p>

<p> DR. TOD MIKURIYA, M.D., PSYCHIATRIST, BERKELEY, CA </p>

<p> It is good to see an increase in public awareness about </p>

<p> the dangers of alcohol and tobacco and about the </p>

<p> increasing tendency to classify them as drugs of abuse. </p>

<p> While we focus heavily on the problems of drugs like </p>

<p> cocaine and crack, very little attention has been paid to </p>

<p> the problems caused by poisoning from alcohol and tobacco. </p>

<p> We need to move closer to acceptance of these substances </p>

<p> as dangerous drugs. </p>

<p> A comprehensive proposal regarding drug use in America </p>

<p> would encompass the following six points: </p>

<p> (1) The removal of product liability exemptions for </p>

<p> alcohol. </p>

<p> (2) The removal of price supports for tobacco. </p>

<p> (3) The establishment of a drug users' cooperative. </p>

<p> (4) The legalization of home cultivation of cannabis. </p>

<p> (5) The disallowance of searches of citizens' homes </p>

<p> without a warrant. </p>

<p> (6) A testing of those who test others for drug use. </p>

<p> JOHN GUSTAFSON, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NEW YORK DIVISION OF </p>

<p> SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES </p>

<p> Our agency oversees about 400 local treatment and </p>

<p> prevention programs, with a capacity to treat 46,000 </p>

<p> people and to provide counseling services to another </p>

<p> 17,000. </p>

<p> About 22 percent of New York's population has abused some </p>

<p> type of substance within the last 6 months. Half of this </p>

<p> number abuses drugs on a regular basis. More than 600,000 </p>

<p> people art- considered non-narcotic substance abusers and </p>

<p> about 260,000 are narcotics addicts. </p>

<p> The social and health consequences of legalization would </p>

<p> be too great. Legalization advocates are ignoring the </p>

<p> seductive properties of drugs like cocaine, which </p>

<p> laboratory tests show leave the user craving for more. </p>

<p> While alcohol Prohibition may have been a law enforcement </p>

<p> failure, it was a success healthwise. During the 1920's, </p>

<p> alcohol-related mental illness declined significantly, but </p>

<p> shot back up after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. </p>

<p> From 1917 until 1921, New York State made narcotics </p>

<p> available through clinics. But that practice was </p>

<p> discontinued after it was discovered that many people were </p>

<p> supplementing their legal supply with drugs purchased from </p>

<p> the black market. This is a lesson for those considering </p>

<p> legalization today. </p>

<p> We cannot overlook the impact that legalization would have </p>

<p> on health and health care systems. Many illicit drugs </p>

<p> lead to chronic health problems for users, and this </p>

<p> problem would be pronounced under legalization. </p>

<p> STEVEN WISOTSKY, PROFESSOR OF LAW, NOVA UNIVERSITY </p>

<p> An independent national commission should be set up to </p>

<p> take a fresh look at U.S. drug policy. Such a commission </p>

<p> should have two fundamental goals: To reduce drug abuse, </p>

<p> and to reduce the social problems stemming from the </p>

<p> existence of the black market illicit drug trade. </p>

<p> A clear definition should be reached and agreed upon in </p>

<p> terms of what &quot;the drug problem&quot; in America is. Is
it </p>

<p> drug use in general? Is it drug use by children and </p>

<p> teenagers? Is it drug use that proves to be injurious to </p>

<p> others or to the drug users themselves? Is it the black </p>

<p> market and the events associated with that market in terms </p>

<p> of crime and violence? </p>

<p> Detailed studies and polls should be conducted to </p>

<p> determine how drugs should be legalized. This should be </p>

<p> along the lines of marketing surveys done to prepare for </p>

<p> the sale and distribution of other products. </p>

<p> For example, focus groups can be set up, and groups of </p>

<p> individuals-such as prison volunteers serving life </p>

<p> sentences-can be used for tracking the effects of certain </p>

<p> drugs and also for gauging the addictive qualities of </p>

<p> narcotics. </p>

<p> Among the priorities of drug control should be the </p>

<p> protection of children, the protection of the safety and </p>

<p> health of the public and the preservation of individual </p>

<p> liberties in the process. </p>

<p> The real moral high ground in finding a Solution to the </p>

<p> drug crisis is one that will allow responsible, competent </p>

<p> adults to have the freedom of choice so long as they do </p>

<p> not intrude on the rights and privileges of others. No </p>

<p> drug control policy should affront the Constitution. </p>

<p> DR. MITCHELL ROSENTHAL, M.D., PRESIDENT, PHOENIX HOUSE, </p>

<p> NEW YORK, NY </p>

<p> Drug legalization would increase drug use and would </p>

<p> further aggravate all the destabilizing influences that </p>

<p> plague societv today. </p>

<p> Addiction to illicit drugs has an enormous impact on the </p>

<p> character, behavior and values of the abuser. While just </p>

<p> as many cigarette smokers have become dependent on that </p>

<p> product, the number of cocaine users, the power of cocaine </p>

<p> addiction and the amounts that addicts would use if it </p>

<p> were readily available and less expensive is ignored by </p>

<p> those pushing legalization. </p>

<p> Illicit drug use rapidly diminishes one's ability to lead </p>

<p> a normal, productive life. Drug abuse causes self- </p>

<p> destructive behavior, lowering the self-esteem and </p>

<p> creating the potential for violent, antisocial behavior. </p>

<p> Projections that drug use would double or even triple </p>

<p> under legalization should be taken seriously. The </p>

<p> greatest increase would come from those between the ages </p>

<p> of 12 and 21 years old. Projections of drug-related </p>

<p> deaths post-legalization range from 100,000 to 500,000. </p>

<p> The social order will suffer. Drug users are generally </p>

<p> irresponsible people whose deviant behavior ranges from </p>

<p> destroying relationships to inability to lead productive </p>

<p> work lives to crime. All of these possibilities will be </p>

<p> raised with legalized drugs. </p>

<p> We can realistically expect to overcome the drug crisis </p>

<p> with a shifting public attitude and a stronger effort to </p>

<p> enforce drug laws on the street. </p>

<p> ETHAN NADELMANN, PH.D., ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, PRINCETON </p>

<p> UNIVERSITY </p>

<p> Neither legalization nor decriminalization should be </p>

<p> considered a surrender. They are the policies that drug </p>

<p> dealers fear most. </p>

<p> What is legalization? It is a model of analysis. It is a </p>

<p> cost benefit analysis of current policies. We have to </p>

<p> look at our policy and costs and compare to other systems </p>

<p> and figure out which has the most benefits for the money- </p>

<p> What is the drug problem? This must be defined before </p>

<p> going further. In the 1920's, people did not talk of
&quot;the </p>

<p> alcohol problem.&quot; Instead, they separated the problem
into </p>

<p> one of crime--the Al Capone types and their influence on </p>

<p> the consumption of alcoholand into another category of </p>

<p> alcohol abuse. It was decided that Prohibition was not </p>

<p> worth the costs, even if it reduced abuse to a degree. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, today the drug problem is not separated as </p>

<p> such and &quot;the drug problem&quot; is defined as both
crime and </p>

<p> abuse. </p>

<p> We will not be able to move forward until we make the </p>

<p> distinction as was made with alcohol in the 1920's. </p>

<p> Nearly 20 percent of all State and local resources go to </p>

<p> fighting drugs, In Washington, DC, more than half the </p>

<p> people in jail are there on drug-related charges, and the </p>

<p> figure in New York City is about 40 percent. </p>

<p> SUE RUSCHE, NATIONAL DRUG INFORMATION CENTER, FAMILIES IN </p>

<p> ACTION </p>

<p> It is important that the perspective of families be </p>

<p> included in the national debate on legalization. </p>

<p> In looking at both the alcohol and cigarette industries </p>

<p> they spent more on advertising in the previous year than </p>

<p> Congress appropriated to fight the drug crisis. We do not </p>

<p> need any more legal industries of this sort amassing large </p>

<p> profits in selling their products to our children and to </p>

<p> ourselves. </p>

<p> Some legalization proponents make the argument that </p>

<p> alcohol is legal and is not sold to young people. But </p>

<p> alcohol sales to minors are routine as sales clerks fail </p>

<p> to ask for identification or look the other way when </p>

<p> obviously underage young people make an alcohol purchase. </p>

<p> If we cannot expect the alcohol and tobacco industry to </p>

<p> prevent sales to minors, then how can we expect a cocaine </p>

<p> or opiate industry from doing the same? </p>

<p> At the very least, illicit drugs are as harmful as alcohol </p>

<p> and tobacco. Fewer people die from them than from alcohol </p>

<p> and tobacco because fewer people use them, and fewer </p>

<p> people use them because they are illegal. There are 18 </p>

<p> million marijuana users compared to 116 million alcohol </p>

<p> users; and there are 6 million cocaine users compared to </p>

<p> 60 million tobacco users. </p>

<p> Alcohol and tobacco are leading killers in the United </p>

<p> States. We do not live with alcohol and tobacco, we die </p>

<p> with them. It would take two walls like the Vietnam </p>

<p> Memorial shrine in Washington, DC to memorialize all those </p>

<p> killed by alcohol in a year. It would take 7 to 10 walls </p>

<p> to cover all those who die from tobacco. </p>

<p> Some say taxes from drugs sales could go toward treatment </p>

<p> and education, but no money from the sale of alcohol and </p>

<p> tobacco ever goes toward education and treatment for those </p>

<p> problems. </p>

<p> Legalization would not eliminate profits- They would </p>

<p> simply be shifted from the drug traffickers on the street </p>

<p> to the people who run legitimate businesses. </p>

<p> It is unreasonable to think that drug use would not </p>

<p> increase under legalization. A total of 11 States have </p>

<p> decriminalized marijuana. From 1972 to 1978, in those </p>

<p> States, marijuana use, as a result of the </p>

<p> decriminalization, rose 125 percent among young adults, </p>

<p> 130 percent among high school seniors, 200 percent among </p>

<p> older adults and 240 percent among teenagers. </p>

<p> We are beginning to see drug use drop off in this country. </p>

<p> We would like to see the Congress create a National Drug </p>

<p> Corps similar to the Peace Corps, where parents and </p>

<p> children could be trained to give I or 2 years of service </p>

<p> fighting drug abuse in their communities. </p>

<p> Summary of Testimony From Friday, September 30,1988 </p>

<p> DR. DAVID F. MUSTO, M.D., DRUG HISTORIAN, YALE UNIVERSiry </p>

<p> Around the turn of the century, drugs such as cocaine, </p>

<p> heroin and morphine were legally sold and consumed in the </p>

<p> United States, Consumption of these drugs reached a peak </p>

<p> around 1890 to 1900. </p>

<p> Because of the high rate of consumption and the effects </p>

<p> these then-legal narcotics were having on individuals and </p>

<p> families, America moved toward enacting laws and controls </p>

<p> that have led to today's drug laws. </p>

<p> We are currently experiencing our second epidemic with </p>

<p> cocaine. The first occurred around the mid 1880's, when </p>

<p> this drug was made available in 14 different forms. One </p>

<p> could smoke it, rub it on in a salve, inject it, or even </p>

<p> sniff it. </p>

<p> Cocaine's image as the &quot;All-American tonic&quot; ended
around </p>

<p> 1900, when it came to be known as the most dangerous drug </p>

<p> in the country. The first congressionally passed </p>

<p> legislation regulating cocaine was in 1914, and was called </p>

<p> the Harrison Narcotics Act. </p>

<p> A key to reducing the demand for drugs will be a changing </p>

<p> of the public's attitudes. </p>

<p> Those supporting a look-see at legalization must be </p>

<p> reminded that there are many things in our society that we </p>

<p> do not attempt a look-see because we know in advance it is </p>

<p> bad and would lead to worse problems. One of them, for </p>

<p> example, is racial discrimination. We ask for laws </p>

<p> restricting it because we know it is bad. </p>

<p> Ending the drug crisis will be a very gradual thing. It </p>

<p> cannot be done in just 2 or 3 years. Drug use in America </p>

<p> peaked around 1979, and at that time there was a call for </p>

<p> legalization. </p>

<p> The argument for legalizing cocaine in the 1970's was that </p>

<p> cocaine was a harmless drug unless misused. Today, the </p>

<p> argument is that legalizing it will remove the criminal </p>

<p> influence. We now see cocaine as bad in itself, and this </p>

<p> is a tremendous attitude turnaround that can be used as a </p>

<p> foundation for a further decline in cocaine usage. </p>

<p> DR. DALE MASI, PROFESSOR, SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK AND </p>

<p> COMMUNITY PLANNING, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND </p>

<p> The workplace cannot afford the legalization of illicit </p>

<p> drugs. </p>

<p> In previous testimony before the Select Committee on </p>

<p> Narcotics Abuse and Control, my position was that there </p>

<p> was a dramatic need for an increase in industry drug </p>

<p> programs in this country. That need is greater today: </p>

<p> (1) A majority of illicit drug users are in the </p>

<p> workplace. </p>

<p> (2) Alcohol is the primary drug of abuse in the </p>

<p> workplace. </p>

<p> (3) Prescription drugs are the second largest drug of </p>

<p> abuse in the workplace. </p>

<p> (4) The most recent surveys indicate that 19- to 25-year- </p>

<p> olds are the biggest abusers of cocaine, with 25- to 30- </p>

<p> year-olds being the second largest group. If cocaine is </p>

<p> legalized, it would outdistance both alcohol and </p>

<p> prescription drugs as the most abused drug in the </p>

<p> workplace. </p>

<p> Drug abuse in the workplace translates into escalating </p>

<p> health insurance bills. In addition, it contributes to </p>

<p> the problems of absenteeism, sick leave, accidents, other </p>

<p> rising health costs and more worker compensation claims. </p>

<p> More emphasis will have to be placed on companies </p>

<p> educating workers about the dangers of drug abuse, as has </p>

<p> been the case with tobacco. Few companies, a study by </p>

<p> Cook and Harrell shows, have drug education promotion </p>

<p> programs. The IBM Corp. stands out as a model for the </p>

<p> rest of the industry in the country. </p>

<p> Schools of medicine, social work and psychology today </p>

<p> rarely require that students take a course in alcohol or </p>

<p> drug addiction. Fewer schools of psychology require a </p>

<p> course in drug addiction than was the case in 1950. The </p>

<p> council on social work education, the accrediting arm for </p>

<p> such schools, does not even require that such courses be </p>

<p> taught for master's and social work candidates. </p>

<p> We need employee assistance programs that concentrate on </p>

<p> reaching employees early. New funds are needed for </p>

<p> meaningful programs, especially outpatient services. </p>

<p> DR. LAWRENCE BROWN, M.D., CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR, DEPARTMENT </p>

<p> OF MEDICINE, HARLEM HOSPITAL CENTER AND THE COLLEGE OF </p>

<p> PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS </p>

<p> Legalization advocates seem to be motivated by two </p>

<p> arguments, One is that current response to the drug crisis </p>

<p> has been shamefully inadequate. Number two, legalization </p>

<p> appears to represent a reasonable alternative to the </p>

<p> current response. </p>

<p> Our current policy on drug abuse can be addressed from two </p>

<p> angles. We can look at it either from the perspective of </p>

<p> those who use drugs, or from the perspective of the </p>

<p> consequences of drug use. </p>

<p> A most common problem of those admitted to Harlem Hospital </p>

<p> for treatment of kidney failure and in need of dialysis is </p>

<p> prior drug abuse. </p>

<p> Our approach to drug abuse as a nation is that we continue </p>

<p> to view it as a stigma, rather than the public health </p>

<p> problem that it truly is. </p>

<p> It is ridiculous that so little of the educational </p>

<p> training involves the study of drug abuse, Professional </p>

<p> and health professional schools should be encouraged to </p>

<p> try to include drug abuse studies in their curriculums. </p>

<p> Existing drug treatment facilities must be improved as </p>

<p> well. The least attractive facilities are often allocated </p>

<p> for outpatient drug treatment services. An expansion of </p>

<p> treatment capability must focus on both quality and </p>

<p> quantity. </p>

<p> The legalization debate provides the country with an </p>

<p> excellent opportunity to reassess Federal drug policy. </p>

<p> These discussions will far exceed their potential if they </p>

<p> are used to chart a bold new course in responding to </p>

<p> America's drug crisis. </p>

<p> DAVID BOAZ, VICE PRESIDENT FOR PUBLIC POLICY AFFAIRS, CATO </p>

<p> INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> Alcohol did not cause high crime rates in the 1920's. </p>

<p> Prohibition of alcohol was the problem. With today's drug </p>

<p> crisis, it is not the drugs, but rather the prohibition of </p>

<p> these drugs that are causing problems with crime and </p>

<p> violence. </p>

<p> There are six ways in which drug laws impact negatively on </p>

<p> society: </p>

<p> (1) Drug laws drive up the price. Users are forced to </p>

<p> commit crimes to support their habits. Prohibition pushes </p>

<p> some prices as much as 100 times higher than normal. Some </p>

<p> experts say half the crime in major cities results from </p>

<p> drug prohibition and many policemen will say the same </p>

<p> thing if they were free to express themselves honestly. </p>

<p> (2) Drug laws cause corruption. The extraordinary </p>

<p> profits become an irresistible temptation to policemen. </p>

<p> (3) Buyers are forced to come in contact with criminals, </p>

<p> unlike those who purchase alcohol without the help of </p>

<p> criminal,q because it is no longer illegal. </p>

<p> (4) Intense law enforcement forces the creation of </p>

<p> stronger, more potent drugs. Crack, for example, is a </p>

<p> result of drug prohibition. </p>

<p> (5) Civil liberties are abused under drug prohibition. </p>

<p> (6) A final negative result of drug prohibition is that </p>

<p> it leads to futility. In the case of today's drug crisis, </p>

<p> the drug war simply is not working. </p>

<p> GLORIA WHITFIELD (RECOVERED DRUG ADDICT), VOCATIONAL </p>

<p> REHARILITATION SPECIALIST, REHABILITATION SERVICES </p>

<p> ADMINISTRATION) DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT, </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> As a rehabilitation specialist in drug and alcohol abuse, </p>

<p> it is frightening to consider what the caseload would be </p>

<p> if drugs were legalized. </p>

<p> How can anyone with any insight or perception believe that </p>

<p> legalizing drugs would be the answer to the drug crisis? </p>

<p> If the main reason to legalize drugs is to remove the </p>

<p> profit from the criminals and drug traffickers, then it is </p>

<p> also saying that the U.S. Government &quot;wants a piece of
the </p>

<p> action.&quot; Uncle Sam would become the biggest dope pusher
of </p>

<p> all time. </p>

<p> Generations of young Americans are dying from drug abuse. </p>

<p> Minds and motivation are being destroyed. Families are </p>

<p> being destroyed. America is being weakened. </p>

<p> Legalization could not be accomplished without having to </p>

<p> rely on imports. Small, drug-producing countries would </p>

<p> soon become superpowers and nations with gross national </p>

<p> products inflated by cocaine and heroin production would </p>

<p> have access to nuclear warheads. </p>

<p> Fraudulent prescriptions are already a big business in the </p>

<p> United States. </p>

<p> The future for America would be very dim under </p>

<p> legalization. Medical schools, laws schools and other </p>

<p> institutions of higher learning would not touch students </p>

<p> who use drugs, even if they were legal, because it is </p>

<p> known that drug users are a detriment to themselves. </p>

<p> Under legalization, there would not be enough hospitals to </p>

<p> take care of everybody. Doctors and nurses would be in </p>

<p> demand like never before. Long lines of dope fiends </p>

<p> waiting for a fix or a hit would replace the winos in the </p>

<p> streets. </p>

<p> Those favoring legalization are being insensitive. </p>

<p> Legalization is a further step toward the perpetuation of </p>

<p> evil influence over society, rather than a positive step </p>

<p> toward resolving some of the criminal problems in society </p>

<p> like poverty, insufficient health care, and insufficient </p>

<p> education. </p>

<p> America should wage a real war against drugs, using any </p>

<p> means necessary to prevent it from entering our ports and </p>

<p> coming across our borders. </p>

<p> RICHARD KAREL, JOURNALIST </p>

<p> Across the board legalization is not the answer to the </p>

<p> drug crisis that plagues the country today. More </p>

<p> dangerous drugs should continue to be prohibited, while </p>

<p> less dangerous narcotics be made legally available. </p>

<p> During the time that America was under alcohol </p>

<p> Prohibition, Great Britain was attacking the alcohol </p>

<p> problem through a combination of higher taxes, rationing </p>

<p> and limited hours of distribution. When the Volstead Act </p>

<p> was repealed, alcohol abuse rose in the United States </p>

<p> while Great Britain had already began experiencing a </p>

<p> leveling off of alcohol use. Alcohol abuse has remained </p>

<p> relatively low since. </p>

<p> Recent Studies indicate a decrease in cirrhosis of the </p>

<p> liver in the United States despite alcohol being a legal </p>

<p> substance. With tobacco, limited restrictions and </p>

<p> education have cut sales of this product to minors. </p>

<p> Prohibition is neither necessary nor advisable for either </p>

<p> of these products. </p>

<p> The focus should be on keeping dangerous drugs like crack </p>

<p> and PCP away from children, and on preventing clinically </p>

<p> controlled drugs from being diverted. This would provide </p>

<p> a moral justification for the antidrug activities of law </p>

<p> enforcement. </p>

<p> PAUL MOORE, DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR, THE SCOTT NEWMAN CENTER, </p>

<p> Los ANGELES, CA </p>

<p> The Newman Center unequivocally opposes drug legalization. </p>

<p> The more time spent debating the issue, the more </p>

<p> credibility it receives. </p>

<p> Time should be spent developing more sound policies </p>

<p> regarding treatment, rehabilitation and prevention. </p>

<p> Society seems to be hooked on hyped miracle solutions that </p>

<p> look good but would not work. </p>

<p> Drugs, drug abuse and the associated crime are all </p>

<p> symptoms of deeply rooted problems in our society. Drugs </p>

<p> did not invent poverty, broken homes, latchkey children, </p>

<p> greed or the human desire for a quick- 'ix. Drugs did not </p>

<p> contribute to the general breakdown of moral and ethical </p>

<p> values. Without drugs, these problems would not disappear </p>

<p> and with drugs they are pronounced. </p>

<p> There is a perception that the drug problem can be </p>

<p> sanitized through legalization, giving residents of </p>

<p> ghettos and barrios all they want so long as they refrain </p>

<p> from committing crimes against the rest of society. </p>

<p> The threat of legalization is that it stands to send a </p>

<p> whole new set of mixed messages to America's youth. Drugs </p>

<p> already have a glamorous image. </p>

<p> If drugs were legalized, the gains from national efforts </p>

<p> of the past decade-such as a decrease in consumption and a </p>

<p> change in attitude of the Nation's youth-would be lost. </p>

<p> MARVIN MILLER, MEMBER, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, NORML, </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> Drugs are a problem and they create a tremendous strain on </p>

<p> the Nation's financial resources. </p>

<p> It is commonly known that there are no funds available for </p>

<p> desperately needed educational and training programs. The </p>

<p> underground narcotics trade is being allowed to run </p>

<p> rampant and control the marketplace. It controls purity </p>

<p> as well. All iirugs are, being treated as if they are the </p>

<p> same. </p>

<p> A combined total of $10 billion is spent annually on State </p>

<p> and Federal antidrug efforts. Most of this expenditure </p>

<p> goes for enforcing marijuana possession laws. About 40 </p>

<p> percent of all drug arrests relate to marijuana. Of the </p>

<p> 40-percent figure, 9 of 10 cases involve simple </p>

<p> possession. </p>

<p> There are some 50 million marijuana smokers in the United </p>

<p> States. They are otherwise law-abiding citizens who pay </p>

<p> taxes and are productive. </p>

<p> The Nation's $10 billion antidrug budget allots only about </p>

<p> 5 percent for education programs. No money exists for </p>

<p> national education or treatment programs. </p>

<p> NORML has put together a bill to make marijuana available </p>

<p> legally as a controlled and regulated substance. </p>

<p> An administrative law judge has ruled that marijuana is </p>

<p> the most benign substance known to man. It is not </p>

<p> addictive. It does not generate violence. </p>

<p> The Nation should look at new ways to battle the drug </p>

<p> crisis. Not every drug can be legalized, yet at the same </p>

<p> time, 50 million marijuana using Americans should not be </p>

<p> branded criminals. </p>

<p> RAY WHITFIELD (RECOVERED DRUG ADDICT), DRUG ABUSE </p>

<p> CONSULTANT, WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> Legalization is not a positive proposal. It is based on </p>

<p> what may be a false assumption, that legalization is a </p>

<p> proposal intended to reduce drug abuse. </p>

<p> Drug-related murders would not necessarily decrease as a </p>

<p> result of legalization. Drug-related murder should take </p>

<p> into account drug related death, which is less glamorous, </p>

<p> but also a tragic consequence of drug abuse. </p>

<p> Many in our society have turned to drug abuse simply </p>

<p> because they are hopeless and helpless. Drugs ease the </p>

<p> pain of their reality. Many people have lived lives much </p>

<p> worse than what the criminal justice system can mete out. </p>

<p> The Nation's Government has been duplicitous in dealing </p>

<p> with the drug crisis. While Government does not </p>

<p> officially sanction drug use, it has pushed policies that </p>

<p> contribute to it-such as the lack of antidrug education </p>

<p> and treatment centers in ghettos during the 1940's, 1950's </p>

<p> and 1960's, and the closing of the only two Federal </p>

<p> treatment centers in Lexington, KY and Texas. </p>

<p> Drugs generally have not been considered a national </p>

<p> problem so long as there was the perception that it was a </p>

<p> problem of minoritics and poor whites. Middle and upper </p>

<p> income individuals, meanwhile, generally have looked at </p>

<p> cocaine as a suitable, nonaddictive drug. </p>

<p> Now that cocaine and its negative consequences have </p>

<p> reached suburbia, it is a national problem. This is </p>

<p> duplicity. </p>

<p> Drug abuse is not the root problem. It is a very </p>

<p> destructive symptom of other maladies. </p>

<p> SENAT0R JOSEPH GALIBER, NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY </p>

<p> In the last 20 years or so, little or nothing has happened </p>

<p> in terms of solving the Nation's drug crisis. </p>

<p> I introduced a bill in the State assembly earlier this </p>

<p> year to set up a commission to study legalization and </p>

<p> decriminalization in the State of New York. </p>

<p> America has always been the noble experiment on freedom </p>

<p> that other nations around the world have looked to as an </p>

<p> example. But now, out of frustration, Americans are </p>

<p> beginning to espouse violations of freedoms and civil </p>

<p> liberties as the answer to this frustration. </p>

<p> Drug trafficking must be eliminated through the </p>

<p> legalization of narcotics. </p>

<p> Responsible officials are suggesting arming our police </p>

<p> with more powerful weapons. They have suggested shooting </p>

<p> down suspicious planes. They have called for a doubling </p>

<p> of agents and resources, martial law and the death penalty </p>

<p> for drug traffickers. </p>

<p> We fail to realize the coexistence of two separate </p>

<p> problems regarding the Nation's drug crisis. There is </p>

<p> drug abuse and there is drug trafficking. It is the </p>

<p> trafficking that causes shootouts, raids, deaths and </p>

<p> injuries. If all drugs were legalized right now and given </p>

<p> away free, then the traffickers would cease coming in </p>

<p> immediately. The profit would be gone. </p>

<p> Drug abuse would not be eliminated under legalization, but </p>

<p> the horrible problems associated with the drug trade would </p>

<p> be gone. </p>

<p> The questions posed by Chairman Rangel can be answered in </p>

<p> the context of the alcohol industry: </p>

<p> Question. What narcotics and drugs would be legalized? </p>

<p> Answer. All. </p>

<p> Question. Who would be allowed to buy these narcotics? </p>

<p> Would there be an age limit? </p>

<p> Answer. The same limitations as those for purchasing </p>

<p> alcohol. </p>

<p> Question. Would we sell drugs to people who just want to </p>

<p> experiment and encourage them to pick up the habit? </p>

<p> Answer. We would sell drugs in the same fashion and with </p>

<p> the same restrictions as the selling of alcohol. </p>

<p> Question. Where would these drugs be sold? </p>

<p> Answer. In the same places and under the same controls as </p>

<p> alcohol, </p>

<p> Question. Where would we obtain our supply of these legal </p>

<p> drugs? </p>

<p> Answer. In the same way that there are manufacturers of </p>

<p> alcohol. </p>

<p> Do you for one minute think the tobacco industry has not </p>

<p> put together long ago contingency plans to produce </p>

<p> marijuana cigarettes when legalization becomes a reality? </p>

<p> Question. Would private industry be allowed to </p>

<p> participate in this market? </p>

<p> Answer. Of course. In the same way as in alcohol. </p>

<p> Question. If drugs would become legal, would we allow </p>

<p> pilots, railroad workers and nuclear plant employees to </p>

<p> use them? </p>

<p> Answer. Do we permit them to use alcohol? </p>

<p> Question. If drugs were legalized, how would we back up </p>

<p> our argument with our children and youth that drugs are </p>

<p> harmful? </p>

<p> Answer. In the same way that we do with alcohol. </p>

<p> The Volstead Act, which made liquor illegal, created </p>

<p> violence, warfare, bloodshed, corruption, illicit dealers </p>

<p> and sellers on a sale that was unprecedented until now. </p>

<p> Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past by continuing </p>

<p> to escalate a war which is totally unnecessary. </p>

<p> ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF HON. LARRY SMITH OF FLORIDA </p>

<p> Legalization will not alleviate the drug problem. Drugs </p>

<p> such as heroin and cocaine destroy both the mind and the </p>

<p> body. The new form of cocaine known as crack or rock is </p>

<p> highly addictive. Legalizing drugs would be the same as </p>

<p> admitting that we, as a people and society, cannot control </p>

<p> our actions and prefer self-destruction. Who among us </p>

<p> wants the U.S. Government to be in the business of </p>

<p> distributing cocaine, heroin, PCP or any other killing, </p>

<p> brutalizing substance? </p>

<p> Very few people believe that legalized drugs would reduce </p>

<p> the impact of drug abuse on society. Such a proposal </p>

<p> might eliminate some of the existing criminal element </p>

<p> involved in drug trafficking, but it would not stop </p>

<p> somebo4y (whether the government, tobacco companies, or </p>

<p> pharmaceutical companies) from profiting from the human </p>

<p> misery associated with drug use and abuse. </p>

<p> If we would not legalize drugs for juveniles (and we would </p>

<p> not), a flourishing market would still exist to sell to </p>

<p> them illegally. What about crime? If we distribute or </p>

<p> make legal drugs that cloud the mind or remove </p>

<p> inhibitions, does anyone believe that there will be less </p>

<p> crime? Does anyone believe that people who are on only a </p>

<p> fixed ration of free or legal drugs will not want more and </p>

<p> that someone will sell it to them illegally? And that to </p>

<p> pay for those extra&quot; drugs the drug users will not
commit </p>

<p> crimes? </p>

<p> Congress should do everything it can to eliminate drug </p>

<p> trafficking and drug abuse. The task will not be easy, </p>

<p> but that does not mean that we cannot try to alleviate </p>

<p> this devastating problem. Legalization would be the easy </p>

<p> way out, but it would not solve the underlying problem. </p>

<h1>The Anaheim Park Ordinance </h1>

<p> In our continuing effort to bring to you the news on this
issue, we ran across the following item. It seems that the city
of Anaheim, California (Disneyland, USA) decided to pass an
ordinance banning anyone who had ever been convicted of a drug
offense from visiting a public park. I could go on for hours
describing all the reasons this is a really dumb idea, but let it
suffice to say that the ordinance was repealed after the local
probation officers complained that their office was right across
from a park and the ordinance would mean that many of the people
they had to deal with would have no place to sit while waiting
for their appointments. </p>

<p> Just another outstandingly dumb approach to the drug problem.

<h1>DRUGS AND THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY </h1>

<p>[Page: E2111] </p>

<p><b>HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON OF NEW YORK</b> </p>

<p>in the House of Representatives </p>

<p>Thursday, October 6, 1994 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, it was recently brought to my
attention that drug legalization advocates are using the
electronic information superhighway to organize the legalization
movement and share information on drug use. The information
superhighway was certainly not created to propagate such
misinformation and the criminal activity associated with it. This
use was brought to my attention by drug legalization opponents
who use the information superhighway everyday in their vocations.
</p>

<p>Apparently, the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws recently entered remarks which I personally made
in opposition to drug legalization on this House floor as an
example of `rabid, right-wing prohibitionist propaganda.' Because
I believe, along with 95 percent of America, that the use of
illicit drugs is wrong, I was singled out as an enemy of drug
users. </p>

<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, I am honored. The use of illegal drugs in
an anathema to the social and moral fabric of our Nation.
President Reagan's and President Bush's `War on Drugs ' was
premised on the belief that society was better served and
protected if our Nation universally and actively opposed drug
use. This program worked as planned. The use of cocaine,
marijuana, heroin, and most other illegal drugs declined. Our
Nation's young children and teenagers who grew up during the
1980's were told and made aware of the evils and the hardships
associated with drug use. I fear for the kind of message the
children growing up in the 1990's are receiving. Pro-drug use and
legalization messages on the information superhighway through
Internet are wrong. </p>

<p>I was appalled to learn that this information even includes
such things as tips on growing marijuana and ways to evade law
enforcement. As more and more Americans jump onto this latest
technological advancement, more and more citizens will have
access to this ill-advised information. For example, the
information superhighway is now available in most elementary and
secondary schools and in many American homes. Now elementary
students like my own grandson can obtain valuable information
about an obscure nation in the South Pacific during a social
studies class and then flip a screen to discover the glories of
drug use and criminal activity. </p>

<p>Drug legalization advocates from all over the country are
using this universal technology to further their movement and
deceive more Americans. As Congress reviews this very important
technology during the 104th Congress, the use of this service by
pro-drug organizations and individuals for the propagation of
this ilk must be addressed. As a nation founded on the freedoms
of speech and press, the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness must not be trampled by the disease of illegal drugs
.<br>

<p>[Page: E499] </p>

<p><b>HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON OF NEW YORK</b> </p>

<p>in the House of Representatives </p>

<p>Thursday, March 2, 1995 </p>

<p><b>A Note to Readers: </b>If you want some current
information, direct from Europe, to compare with Mr. Solomon's
statements here, take a look at <a
href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~mlap/">DrugText Europe</a>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, let me commend to you the following
article written by a distinguished doctor and chairman of the
International Drug Strategy Institute, Eric A. Voth, M.D. Dr.
Voth advocates retaining tough drug laws to guard against rising
crime and experimentation. Citing Holland as an example, the
legalization of drugs has resulted in greatly increased crime and
addiction. The only way to combat the increase of drug use in
this country is to stand firm against recent attempt by prodrug
groups to mute public awareness. These groups attempt to disguise
the dangers of drug abuse and consequently jeopardize future
generations. </p>

<p>REPEATING HISTORY'S MISTAKES </p>

<p>The international drug policy debate rages regarding decisions
whether to fundamentally change drug policy toward legalization
or decriminalization of drug use, or to remain with restrictive
policies. If we examine two examples of softening of drug policy,
we will find ample reason to continue with restrictive policy. </p>

<p>In the mid to late 1970's during the Carter administration,
drug policy visibly softened. Several states decriminalized
marijuana, and in fact Alaska legalized marijuana. Drug policy
`specialists' in their infinite wisdom supported the flawed
concept called `responsible use' of drugs as a way that users
could maintain personal use of drugs and avoid the ravages of
addiction and physical problems. </p>

<p>Permissive drug policy originated with organizations like the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. President
Carter's drug policy advisor Peter Bourne, as well as others like
Arnold Trebach, Mathea Falco, Peter Reuter, Mark Kleiman helped
to press for the lenient policy. </p>

<p>Interestingly, during that time the use of marijuana and other
drugs drastically increased. Use also increased in adolescents
despite the fact that drugs never become legal or decriminalized
for that age group. The use of marijuana among high school
students in Oregon during decriminalization was double that of
the national average. National averages of marijuana use among
high school seniors increased to 50% of seniors having used in
the previous year, and 10.7% used daily. </p>

<p>Ultimately, parents began to object to the rampant use of
drugs , especially marijuana, among their children. In the early
1980's the `parents' anti-drug movement began. Because of the
drastic failure of lenient drug policies, steady pressure was
exerted at national and local levels for restrictive drug
policies. A huge national wave of high quality research,
grassroots prevention organizations, and tightening of drug laws
began. </p>

<p>Predictably, the use of drugs among `recreational' users
dropped. High school seniors use of marijuana dropped to 23% of
seniors using within the last year and 2% using on a daily basis.
The use among hard addicts did not drop. Strangely the cry has
been sounded by some that the drug war did not work. That outcry,
however, was almost exclusively being sounded by individuals who
favored legalization or decriminalization back in the 1970's. The
same individuals who called for soft policy in the earlier era
are calling for the new harm reduction policy today. Hidden
within such policy is the intent to gain decriminalization of
drugs . </p>

<p>Holland has decriminalized drugs and tried harm reduction.
Since the softening of drug policy there, shootings have
increased 40%, robberies 62%, and car thefts 62%. This experiment
which was meant to decrease organized crime has resulted in an
increase in organized crime families from 3 in 1988 to 93 today. </p>

<p>The number of registered marijuana addicts has risen 30% and
the number of other addicts has risen 22%. </p>

<p>The major difference between today and the 1970's is that the
prolegalization effort is more organized and better funded. The
millionaire Richard Dennis from Chicago has given millions to the
drug legalization effort. Billionaire George Soros has given $6
million to the Drug Policy Foundation to help seek legalization
of drugs . He created the Open Society Fund which in turn funds
Mathea Falco's Drug Strategies organization. Steadily, these
groups put a happy and acceptable face on the idea of drug
legalization or decriminalization. </p>

<p>Their public relation campaign has softened public attitudes.
Moves such as full page ads in national newspapers suggesting
alternatives to drug policy are examples. Organized efforts at
such ideas as hemp as a fiber alternative, medical marijuana,
needle exchanges, therapeutic LSD, and others pervade the media.
The Internet is bristling with pro-drug talk groups discussing
recent drug experiences and how and where to obtain drugs . </p>

<p>In the face of these facts, the holdovers from the 70's drug
policy makers are still asking for lenient drug laws. A
substantial number of today's addicts started their use under the
lenient policies of the 1970's. We have had our experience with
decriminalization, and it is time that we recognize it and put
that concept to bed. </p>

<p>The only hope for drug policy is a concerted effort of drug
prevention which upholds the notion of no drug use, drug
interdiction, and drug treatment. If we soften our hold on an
already vexing problem, we will lose the war. </p>

<p> UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES </p>

<p> CONSTITUENT ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEM </p>

<p> We welcome your inquiry to the House of Representatives
Constituent Electronic Mail System. Currently, fifty Members of
the U.S. House of Representatives have been assigned public
electronic mailboxes that may be accessed by their constituents.
The nature and character of the incoming electronic mail has
demonstrated that this capability will be an invaluable source of
information on constituent opinion. We are now in the process of
expanding the project to other Members of Congress, as technical,
budgetary and staffing constraints allow. </p>

<p> Because this program is intended to provide an additional
vehicle for Members to communicate with their constitutents, it
is critical that you include your name and address in your mail
message, preferably at the top of the message. Most Congressional
offices have adequate staff resources to respond only to their
constituents and your inclusion of your full name and mailing
address will insure that your Member can identify your residence
within his or her Congressional District. A number of House
committees and leadership offices have also been assigned public
electronic mailboxes. The names and electronic mailbox addresses
of these offices are listed below after the information about
participating Representatives. </p>

<p> The Document Room of the U.S. House of Representatives has
also been assigned an electronic public mailbox. The name and
electronic mailbox address of the House Document Room is listed
below after the information about participating committees. The
House Document room distributes House Bills, Resolutions,
Reports, Documents, and Public Laws for the 104th Congress. House
Reports, Documents, and Public Laws for the 103rd Congress are
also maintained. The public can obtain 2 copies of up to 12
different House documents per day. Customers should include their
telephone number with their mailing address. All document orders
will be filled and mailed the same day they are received. For
more detailed information or questions, call the Document Room at
(202) 225-3456, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Please
review the list of participating Representatives below, and if
the Congressional District in which you reside is listed, follow
the instructions to begin communicating by electronic mail with
your epresentative. If your Representative is not yet on-line,
please be patient. </p>

<h2><font size="3">THE &quot;SCIENTIFIC&quot; JUSTIFICATION FOR
URINE DRUG TESTING</font></h2>

<p><font size="3">John Morgan, Medical professor and acting
Chairman of Pharmacology, City University of New York Medical
School</font></p>

<p><font size="3">KANSAS LAW REVIEW, 1988, Vol. 36, pp. 683-697</font></p>

<hr>

<h3><font size="3">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">Just as drug use is often ceremonial and
ritualistic, discussions about those problems have a communal,
worshipful character. Individuals have to speak out of strong
conviction, and congregational beliefs are strengthened in a
confirmation of faith and shared attitudes. In recent years, the
experiences described above have been characterized by an
important cohesive element, a shared litany.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Since 1984, when urine testing of unimpaired
civilian workers began to expand rapidly, its public supporters
have used a common set of statements, ideas, and statistics to
justify the imposition of the forced detection and testing of
urine for illegal drugs. The use of this religious language is
not without a purpose. Litany is seldom questioned, nor is the
speaker of litany often called upon to prove the truth of his
statements, even when they involve things material and not
spiritual. I believe this common set of statements used by those
justifying and selling urine tests is repeated, polished, and
accepted with a minimal offering of proof. In this article, I
will identify these statements, search for their sources, and
examine their accuracy.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3">II. THE FIRESTONE &quot;STUDY&quot;</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">Obviously, statements concerning the job
performance of drug users have an impact on their employers. From
the earliest days of the debate, a series of statistics about
drug-using workers, their poor productivity, and high cost to
ther company have been presented. In one of the first proceedings
of a meeting directed to the issues of drug abuse in the
workplace, Robert Angarola and Judith Brunton stated:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A recent study....suggests that drug users were
almost four times as likely to be involved in a plant accident
and were two and one-half times as likely to be absent from work
for more than a week than employees who did not use drugs. Drug
users were five times as likely to file workers' compensation
claims and they received three times the average level of sick
benefits. (1) Further, the drug users were &quot;repeatedly
involved in grievance procedures.&quot; The Angarola-Brunton
document was published in 1984 but they and others had begun
making the remarks frequently by then</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In 1987 testimony before the U.S. House of
Representatives, by Mark de Bernardo of the United States Chamber
of Commerce:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">'recreational' drug users are</font></p>

<p><font size="3">-----2.2 times more likely to request early
dismissal or time off... </font></p>

<p><font size="3">--3.6 times more likely to injure themselves or
another person in a workplace accident</font></p>

<p><font size="3">--5.0 times more likely to file a worker's
compensation claim. (3)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For at least five years, these statistics and
others like them have been voiced and published by testing
advocates, although seldom with de Bernardo's decimal-point
precision. Those whom I have quoted seem to be referring to any
user of illegal drugs and de Bernardo specifically speaks of
recreational drug user. Yet, one might wonder how these data were
gathered, particularly since drug testing in the workplace is
proposed to uncover the secret user. How were these users
described by Angarola and de Bernardo (and many others) found and
analyzed? The answer, as is often the case is simple. They were
not.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The most important source for dissemination of
these statistics seems to be the Drug Abuse and Alcoholism
Newsletter of Dr. Sidney Cohen. (4) This monthly newsletter is
widely distributed and has been collected and published. In the
August 1983 newsletter, Cohen discussed a study by the Firestone
Tire and Rubber Company and constructed the quotable statements
which have appeared and reappeared: &quot;Drug users were five
times as likely to file a Workers' Compensation claim, and they
received three times the average level of sick benefits.&quot;
(5)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Firestone &quot;Study&quot; has never been
published. Thus, Cohen's newsletter seems to be the source of all
such statements. Yet, Cohen gave no attribution nor sources, and
when I wrote to him in 1985 he answered that he did not have a
copy of the study and suggested I write Firestone. After a number
of calls and queries I received a two page document from
Firestone's Medical Director, E. Gates Morgan. The report apears
to be an in-house newsletter. (6) In it, a Mr. Ed Johnson is
interviewed about the Employer Assistance Program
(&quot;EAP&quot;) at Firestone. There are some statements
pertaining to absenteeism, but these are not documented, and more
importantly, refer only to a few alcoholics who have been served
by the Firestone EAP. The statistics generated (if these
calculations based on alcoholics were actually made) have nothing
to do with drug users, recreational or otherwise.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The statistics cited about absenteeism and
workers' compensation claims may have been derived from
interviews with alcoholic workers enrolled in the EAP at
Firestone. These people were not identified by urine testing for
alcohol, but were referred because they or others perceived that
their lives were falling apart. They, unlike workers randomly
tested for drug use, were dysfunctional. To use them as a
justification for testing unimpaired workers is like demanding
that all workers have mandatory periodic rectal temperatures
taken because a case of tuberculosis was found in the workplace.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3">III. THE RTI STUDY FOR DIMINISHED PRODUCTIVITY</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">The Research Triangle Institute
(&quot;RTI&quot;) of North Carolina issued a report in 1984 that
attempted to calculate the economic cost to society of alcohol
and drug abuse and mental illness. (7) It appears to be the
source of the claim that drug abuse costs the United States
thirty-four billion dollars a year in lost productivity. (8)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This claim seems to indicate that somehow
individual worker productivity was assessed by some quantitative
measure and was noted to be seriously diminished. I often ask my
students how they would design a study which might quantify the
effect of drug use or abuse on productivity and they generate
interesting ideas and designs. None, however, have ever come up
with anything as creative as the RTI report.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The National Institute on Drug Abuse
(&quot;NIDA&quot;) Household Survey is the actual source of the
RTI statistics. (9) The RTI analysis itself does not include any
studies about productivity, dor does it document that drug use
was associated with any diminished productivity. The RTI report
relied on the 1982 version of the Household Survey, which
included a question to the adult (older than eighteen years of
age) respondents about daily marijuana use. If the respondent
stated that he or she had ever used marijuana daily for twenty or
thirty days in one month, this respondent's household income was
compared to another household without a daily user. The user
households were estimated to have a household income
approximately twenty-eight percent less than those households
that did not have such an interviewee. According to the RTI
report: &quot;These result have been used to calculate the
reduced productivity due to daily marijuana use. Once again, the
prevalence rates of ever using marijuana daily in the labor force
by age and sex groups....were applied to the number of persons in
the labor force from those groups that experienced
reducedproductivity. This number was multiplied by the expected
productivity in the workplace and in the household and then by
the impairment rate (27.9 percent) to produce the final value:
The loss due to marijuana abuse was estimated at $34.2 billion
for 1980.&quot; (10)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This somewhat opaque quotation means that the
$34 billion &quot;lost&quot; to drug-induced diminished
productivity and the one-third reduction is productivity of the
drug user come from a very unusual calculation. The homes with
daily users had a reduced household income. Because the daily
users all were between eighteen and thirty-four years of age, the
proportion of the work force represented by them was multiplied
by total income expected and this was multiplied by the reduction
figure to generate the $34 billion guess. I have never seen a
published analysis of the RTI study. It is a complex and detailed
document of one hundred thirty-seven pages whose appendices
number nearly one hundred thirty more. Although many of its
assumptions regarding the cost of alcohol and drug abuse are
questionable, I have focused only on the loss of productivity
formulation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The reduced income figure itself may be
incorrect. It relies upon reports from interviewees that they
used drugs and relies upon their estimates of household income.
The income data were grouped in seven broad categories with
intervals as broad as $10,000. (11) To generate the reduction
figure with categories like this amounts to measuring centimeters
using a device graduated in meters. The control households were
generated by selecting a household whose respondent resembled the
marijuana use respondent. This meant that the two respondents
resembled each other in regard to age, education, marital status,
and occupation. (12) The similarities did not include race,
location, or nonchildren resident(s) in the household. Therefore,
a twenty-four year-old single black, high school graduate
brick-layer who smokes marijuana and lives with his grandmother
and uncle in Harlem, could have his family income compared to a
twenty-four year-old single white, high school graduate,
brick-layer living with his parents in an affluent New Jersey
suburb. If the household in Harlem had a lower income, it would
be attributed to diminished productivity caused by marijuana use.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As the RTI authors noted, however, the
association between marijuana use and reduced income is not
necessarily causal. (13) Although age and occupation were
similar, the user may not have concerned himself with income and
may have made other job choices. (14) Moreover, the heavy use of
marijuana could have been secondary to job loss in a poor
economy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This manipulation, which assigned lost
productivity to sometime past heavy use of marijuana, did not
show any association with current use of marijuana (or any other
drug), nor could it show any productivity decrease due to past
use of any other drug. It also could not show any effect of any
drug use in any person greater than age thirty-five. (15) Thus,
according to the study, regular use of marijuana in the past on
the part of females aged twenty-five to thirty-four cost the
nation $2,396,000,000. (16) However, marijuana use by females
greater than thirty-four, cost the nation nothing. (17) In males
aged twenty to twenty-four, regular marijuana use in the past
would have cost the economy $6,723,000,000. (18) On this basis,
however, any use of cocaine, prescription drugs, or phencyclidine
(PCP) by this group cost the nation nothing. Of course, the study
really does not indicate this because its inadequacy prevented
any such calculations. Its inadequacy regarding the marijuana
calculations should be viewed in the same fashion. To stand in
front of an audience and say that drug use cost the nation $34
billion dollars in decreased productivity is foolish and
improper. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Readers may have noted that the past paragraphs
followed the mode of the RTI report and used income and
productivity as equivalents. I do not believe they are
equivalents. Are those who choose to work in positions where they
earn less than the maximum possible less productive? If so, a
judge is less productive than a practicing lawyer, a medical
school professor is less productive than a practicing physician,
a farmer is less productive than a florist, and an elementary
school teacher is less productive than an owner of a day-care
center.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3">IV ILLEGAL DRUG USE IS DECLINING</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">In an affidavit filed in support of the federal
government's attempt to promote urine testing of certain federal
employees under the President's executive order, J. Michael Walsh
characterized the drug problems in America as pervasive:
&quot;Overall, 70.4 million Americans age 12 and over 37% of the
population have used marijuana, cocaine or other illicit drugs at
least once in their lifetime. Nineteen percent of the population
age 12 and over 36.8 million have used illicit drugs at least
once in the past year, and 12 % at least once during the month
prior to being surveyed.&quot; (19)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Walsh himself later notes that of the 70.4
million Americans who have tried an illicit drug at least once in
their lives, for most (sixty two million) that drug was
marijuana. (20) Many of the proponents of testing use such data.
Proponents, however, do not often seem to notice that this same
data reveals that almost fifty percent of those who have ever
used an illegal drug at least once have not used an illegal drug
in the past year and perhaps never will again. (21)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The sources of these data are important and
interesting and merit careful attention. There are two important
surveys funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse from which
most of our knowledge about the use of illegal drugs in the
United States is derived. These surveys are the National
Household Survey and the annual High School Senior Survey. (22)
Both surveys, however, were not constructed to signal serious
heavy drug use: &quot;The unique contribution of serveys of the
general population lies in their ability to furnish prevalence
estimates that include many forms of drug use that never come to
the attention of medical and legal authorities.....Survey
responses permit classification of drug-using behavior along a
continuum of involvement, substituting empirical for arbitrary
definitions of medically or socially pathologic conditions, and
emphasizing the typical nature of the phenomenon rather than its
most dramatic manifestations.&quot; (23)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">These words from the forward to the National
Household Survey published in 1983 seem particularly calm in the
light of the frequent repetition of its glaring numbers to induce
employers and others to join in the zealot's game. The National
Household Survey is a general population survey of household
members aged twelve and above and has been conducted every two to
three years since 1971. It excludes individuals in
institutionalized settings (colleges, prisons, military bases)
and, therefore, as conservative. Because each respondent gives
general data, it can monitor trends by age and sex and other
demographic variables.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The annual High School Senior Survey obtains
self-reported information from approximately 130 high schools in
the continental United States. Between 16,000 and 18,000 seniors
are surveyed. In addition, the investigators construct a sub
sample of individuals from each class who are followed, yielding
a longitudinal study. These two surveys do not yield a horrible
story of an American decline into profligate drug use, but
exactly the opposite. Table I depicts data from the Household
Survy regarding marijuana use over time. (24) Since 1979, the
data indicate a significant decline in use among the two
important youth groups. In the eighteen to twenty-five group, the
percentage of the population that had ever used marijuana
declined from 68.2% to 60.5% Those who had used marijuana in the
year preceeding the survey declined from 46.9% to 37% and in the
last month preceeding the survey, from 35.4% to 21.9%.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Unable to duplicate Tables, charts, and graphs
which follow in original text)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">These national trends also are reflected in the
High School Senior Survey (Table II). (25) The apex of marijuana
use in this group also was noted in 1979 and has steadily
declined. Marijuana use in the month preceeding the survey fell
from 33.7% to 23.4%. Daily use has steadily declined from 10.3%
to 4.0%</font></p>

<p><font size="3">During the growing clamor to test working
Americans, interest in marijuana, the most widely-accepted
illegal drug, has declined, and declined significantly. This fact
is not stressed by those frequently quoting the two survey
instruments. The use of cocaine shows a different but still
hopeful pattern. Between 1974 and 1985, the lifetime prevalence
of cocaine use increased from 5.4 million users to 22.2 million
users. (26) However, the trend in the High School Senior Survy
showed a distinct leveling off between 1982 and 1985 with a
slight decrease. (27) In 1987, cocaine use by high school
students and young adults dropped twenty percent. (28) Again, a
quarter of those reporting cocaine use had not used the drug in
the last year. The decline noted for marijuana has occurred in
most drug categories in the High School Survey including a
decline in current and daily use of alcohol. (29)</font></p>

<h2><font size="3">THE 'SCIENTIFIC' JUSTIFICATION FOR URINE DRUG
SCREENING</font></h2>

<p><font size="3">Dr. John Morgan</font></p>

<p><font size="3">KANSAS LAW REVIEW, VOL. 36, 1988, PP. 683-697
(PART II)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">V. INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND RAILROAD EMPLOYEES</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Among the fears fueling the drive to test is
the specter of industrial accidents and the likelihood of
intoxicated workers harming other workers and the public. The
lack of data that drug use in industry is harmful or an important
cause of accidents does not deter the frequent attribution of
accidents to drug use. Nowhere is this discussion more focused
than on transportation. It is impossible to raise arguments about
testing without provoking commentary on intoxicated airplane
pilots and locomotive engineers. Perhaps the strongest impetus to
testing occurred on January 4, 1987, when a Conrail engineer, who
later tested positive for marijuana, ignored a number of warning
devices and pulled his train into the path of an Amtrak
Metroliner. (30) Sixteen people were killed. (31)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">From February 10, 1986 to January 15, 1987,
under the auspices of the Federal Railroad Administration
(&quot;FRA&quot;), most American rail carriers conducted an
incident-based testing program. Any train accident or incident
associated with a fatality, injury, or nontrivial property damage
resulted in the testing of all operating personnel--- including
the train crews, dispatcher, and policemen. One hundred
seventy-five events in the year led to the testing of 759
employees. (32) Of the 759 employees sampled, 43 tested positive
for controlled substances including alcohol. (33) Of the
forty-three positives, the drugs identified were as follows:
Alcohol = 9 (1.2%) Illicit drugs = 29 (3.8%) Other controlled
substances = 14 (1.8%). (34)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The FRA made public the specific results only
for the alcohol and illicit drug positives, so it was not
possible to know which licit drugs (one assumes obtained by
prescription) were identified in the fourteen workers. Of the
twenty-nine (3.8%)positives for illicit drugs, eighteen had only
THC carboxylic acid (marijuana metabolite). five had only
benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite) and six had both. (35) One
individual who tested positive for methamphetamine also had
tested positive for marijuana and is included in the eighteen.
Despite its listing as illicit, methamphetamine is still
available in the United States as a licit appetite depressant.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The FRA document correctly noted that these
&quot;data are not conclusive of alcohol/drug role in industrial
accidents.&quot; (36) Indeed, of the twenty-nine, at least seven
had job classifications which would seem to place them at a
distance from operating decisions (track patrolman, ticket taker,
conductor, road master). (37) This costly program is not cited
for what appears to be significant evidence that illicit drugs do
not play an obvious role in industrial rail accidents.
Furthermore, there is no reason to believe that an investigation
of other industrial accidents would yield a different picture.
VI. MARIJUANA ISSUES</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Because most workplace positives are due to
marijuana metabolite and most arguments revolve around the
putative dangers of off-the-job marijuana use, the details of
cannabinoid testing are important. A review of these details is,
however, beyond the scope of this article. (38) However, three
points involving marijuana that are commonly used to provoke
testingt merit some discussion. First, the fat storage and
carry-over effect of marijuana. Second, the airplane simuator
testing study. Finally, the growing potency of domestically
available marijuana.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A. Fat Storage and Effect</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The persistence and storage of THC and other
cannainoids after use is subject to much discussion and
misunderstanding. Figure 1 depicts the length of time THC remains
in the plasma after an individual smokes marijuana containing
delta-9-THC (the intoxicating ingredient in marijuana). (39) The
pattern of distribution follows, with some simplification, what
pharmacologists refer to as a two-compartment model. The drug
initially enters the blood stream (compartment I) and then is
rapidly distributed to the deep compartment II, which is most of
the body. The initial rapidly declining concentration curve
represents the disappearance from the blood stream through
distribution. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Unable to show Figure 1)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Three to four hours after the initial
ingestion, the concentration of delta-9-THC has fallen below 2-5
ng. ml in the blood. (40) This concentration represents the
minimal effective concentration. (41) Below this concentration in
the blood, the drug exerts no demonstrable effect. We assume that
like other drugs, the concentration has fallen so that the
complementary concentration in the brain and other receptor
tissue is below the threshold which will produce an effect.
However, delta-9-THC remains in the body.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The second phase of the disapearance curve is
nearly level because its decline is so gradual. This phase
represents to some degree the drug's redistribution from
compartment II to compartment I. This slow decline is used to
calculate the terminal half-life (T 1/2) of THC. A low
concentration, say 1.0 ng ml, will take more than twenty-four
hours to fall to .05 ng / ml. (42) Actually, it probably takes
even more time, but an accurate calculation is difficult because
of the inability to measure extremely low concentrations.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This slow decline is the source of the
popularly-held concept that THC persists in the body's fat. From
this another speculation usually follows. The speculation is that
the THC still is exerting some effect. Current evidence simply
says this is not so. There are many speculations about the
long-lasting effects of THC, but in the nearly thirty years since
delta-9-THC was discovered, nothing has been verified. The brain
actually contains little fat and there is no evidence to support
the idea that the drug particularly persists there. Frequent
users will carry the drug and its metabolites with them--even to
the workplace--but they also will carry some amount of
organochlorine pesticide, lead, and the hydrocarbon solvent used
at work. We might better and more profitably examine the long
term effects of these substances.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">B. Airplane Simulator Testing In Private Pilots</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To justify the intrusion of testing, studies
purporting to show a lasting effect of marijuana have been widely
cited. Marijuana users and their defenders frequently state that
marijuana use-off-the-job is no different than alcohol use
off-the -job. The effects of marijuana and the selective
impairment generated by its use dissipate within three to four
hours and generally correlate with the decline in serum
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to levels of less than 5 ng / ml. (43)
The studies of Herbert Moskowitz and Robert Petersen that
indicate impairment of some psychomotor function for up to eight
hours (44) are puzzling and not entirely scientifically
acceptable. However, assuming they are correct, they still do not
indicate that off-the-job drug use causes on-the-job impairment.
A study by Dr. Jerome Yesavage is another matter. (45) This study
using flight simulators has been widely discussed and previously
used as a strategic justification for urine testing. (46) The
study identifies significant impairment twenty-four hours after
smoking marijuana in a group of volunteer pilots who performed on
a flight simulator. (47) These conclusions are striking and have
not yet been replicated or confirmed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">After careful analysis of the article, I think
that the experimental methodology was so flawed that the study
does not prove impairment at twenty-four hours. (48) Briefly, the
study was uncontrolled and, therefore, scientifically unreliable.
The subjects were studied with no placebos or attempts to conceal
the active treatment. Subject efforts at a control run were
compared to their efforts after they, and the investigators, knew
that they had consumed an active drug. This violates elementary
rules of study design and constitutes a serious flaw in the
study. The study also fails to deal with the characteristics and
prior drug experience of the volunteers, the issues of repeated
testing and training upon the simulator, and the generation of a
large number of simulator-generated measures some of which may
have varied by chance. (49)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">C. THC Content (Potency) of Domestically
Available Marijuana</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A commonly stated and widely accepted belief is
that marijuana's past record of causing minimal harm to users was
based on the use of low-grade material. Many plants, particularly
those growing wild, have a low content of delta-9-THC. (50) It is
often stated that the THC content has increased greatly. In fact,
critics and proponents of testing sound like dealers extolling
the power of Hawaiian and California grown material. &quot;A
glance at the percentages of THC in confiscated marijuana
would....[indicate] that marijuana is now as strong as hashish in
THC content,&quot; (51) This particular claim also has been
difficult to document. However, NIDA has funded a THC analysis
program at the University of Mississippi since 1980. Under the
program, the University analyzes plants received chiefly by law
enforcement agents, both federal (Drug Enforcement Agency) and a
variety of city and state criminal agencies. The accompanying
table lists the findings since 1980. (52)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Year # of samples Mean THC% 1980 35 4.64 1981
129 2.92 1982 148 2.57 1983 387 1.98 1984 330 2.55 1985 842 2.21
1986 800 1.86 1987 (Sept 100 2.5</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The sampling is irregular but chiefly reflects
material seized by these agencies from the back yards, frms, and
even indoor hydroponic systems of growers. The most suspect year,
1980, of course, is the only one in which the mean percentage
exceeded three percent. There has been no real change and
certainly no real increase in marijuana potency in the 1980's.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Interestingly, significant variation in THC
content of marijuana does not necessarily result in greater
delivery. In a study of the delivery of THC into smoke under
standard conditions, 16-19% of the THC content of a cigarette
actually appeared in the smoke. (53) Increasing the THC content
under some circumstances did not influence delivery. For example,
cigarettes carefully prepared to contain 1.6% THC and 3.1% THC
delivered the same amount of THC in smoke. (54)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">VII. CONCLUSIONS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This article has examined a series of
rationales for the imposition of urine testing onto unimpaired
American workers. I have tried in good faith to examine the
arguments from the perspective of empirical studies and
appropriate analysis. I have accused, not subtly, the proponents
of testing of zealotry and improper use of statistics and data to
support a moral stance. To some degree my bias as a civil
libertarian has affected my evaluation. In the long run, however,
the truth about this conflict will depend upon ideas and data and
not biography. Urine testing is a wrong-headed intervention into
the lives of some by those with power over them. It is not a
search for illness but a search for deviance conducted in an
un-American manner. Drug abuse is a specter of the 1980's
resembling the specter of domestic communism of the 1950's. Under
the guise of helping, the proponents of testing are creating
enormous harm. Urine testing is simply drug abuse abuse. </font></p>

<h1><font size="3">Test Negative A look at the
&quot;evidence&quot; justifying illicit-drug tests</font></h1>

<p><font size="3">SCIENCE and the CITIZEN</font></p>

<p><font size="3">SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN March 1990, p. 18</font></p>

<p><font size="3">John Morgan</font></p>

<p><font size="3">More than eight million working Americans had
their urine tested for illegal drugs in 1989, and as many as 15
million will undergo such testing this year, according to the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The fraction of
companies that subject employees or job applicants to testing has
jumped from 21 percent in 1986 to more than 50 percent last year,
according to the American Management Association. The trend seems
likely to continue: a majority of the respondents to a recent
Gallup poll favored random drug testing of all workers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">What underlies the broad acceptance of a
practice that conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia
has called a &quot;needless indignity?&quot; One factor may be
the alarming statistics cited by testing advocates to demonstrate
the high costs of drug abuse. Examination of some of these claims
suggests that they do not always accurately reflect the research
on which they are based. In fact, some of the data could be used
to &quot;prove&quot; that drug use has negligible or even
beneficial effects. Consider these examples.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Last year President George Bush declared that
&quot;drug abuse among American workers costs businesses anywhere
from $60 billion to $100 billion a year in lost productivity,
absenteeism, drug-related accidents, medical claims and
theft.&quot; Variants of this statistic abound in discussions
about drug abuse and are commonly repeated without qualification
by the media. Yet all such claims derive from a single study, one
that &quot;was based upon assumptions which need additional
validation,&quot; according to an assessment last year by NIDA,
the chief federal agency sponsoring research on substance abuse.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The study grew out of a survey of some 3,700
households by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in 1982. The
RTI group found that the average reported income of households
with at least one person who admitted to having ever used
marijuana daily (20 days or more in a 30-day period) was 28
percent lower than the average reported income of otherwise
similar households. The RTI researchers defined that difference
in income as &quot;loss due to marijuana use&quot;; the total
loss, when extrapolated to the general population, came to $26
billion. The researchers then added on the estimated costs of
drug-related crime, health problems and accidents to arrive at a
grand total of $47 billion for &quot;costs to society of drug
abuse.&quot; This figure-- &quot;adjusted&quot; to account for
inflation and population increase -- represents the basis of
Bush's statement, according to Henrick J. Harwood, who headed the
RTI study and is now in the White House drug-policy office.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The RTI survey included questions on current
drug use (at least once within the past month). Yet according to
Harwood there was no significant difference between the income of
households with current users of any illegal drug -- including
marijuana, cocaine and heroin -- and the income of otherwise
similar households. Does this mean that current use of even hard
drugs -- as opposed to perhaps a single marijuana binge in the
distant past -- does not lead to any &quot;loss&quot;? &quot;You
would be on safe ground saying that,&quot; Harwood replies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Officials of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have
testified before Congress and at national conferences on drug
abuse that employees who use drugs are &quot;3.6 times more
likely to injure themselves or another person in a workplace
accident....[and] five times more likely to file a workers'
compensation claim.&quot; The pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-La
Roche, which is leading an antidrug campaign among businesses
(and has a big share of the drug-testing market), also
promulgates this claim in &quot;educational&quot; literature.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In fact, the study on which the claim is based
has &quot;nothing to do with [illegal] drug users,&quot;
according to a 1988 article in the University of Kansas Law
Review by John P. Morgan of the City University of New York
Medical School. Morgan, an authority on drug testing, has traced
the Chamber of Commerce claim to an informal study by the
Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of employees undergoing
treatment for alcholism.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In an interview with SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, J.
Michael Walsh, who heads NIDA's applied research division and is
a strong supporter of workplace testing, singled out two studies
that he said showed drug users are more likely to cause
accidents, miss work and use health benefits. The studies were
done at two utilities: the Utah Power and Light Company and the
Georgia Power Company. The 12 workers in Utah and the 116 in
Georgia who served as the primary research subjects were tested
&quot;for cause&quot;: they had either been involved in
accidents, exhibited other &quot;problem&quot; behavior
(commonly, high absenteeism) or submitted to treatment for
alcoholism or drug abuse. Critics point out that it should not be
terribly surprising if these subjects exhibited the cited traits
at a higher-than-average rate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">What may be surprising is that, according to a
report published by NIDA last year, Utah Power and Light actually
&quot;spent $215 per employee per year less on the drug abusers
in health insurance benefits than on the control group.&quot;
Those who tested positive at Georgia Power had a higher promotion
rate than the company average. Moreover, Georgia workers testing
positive only for marijuana (about 35 percent of all the
positives) exhibited absenteeism some 30 percent lower than
average. Nationwide, Morgan says, marijuana accounts for up to 90
percent of all positive findings, both because it is by far the
most widely used illegal drug and because it persists in urine
for up to a month (compared with two days for most other drugs).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Perhaps the study most publicized of late by
testing proponents involves employees of the U.S. Postal Service.
The service tested 4,396 new hirees in 1987 and 1988 and --
keeping the test results confidential -- tracked the performance
of positives (9 percent of the total) and negatives. By last
September, the service reported, 15.4 percent of the positives
and 10.5 of the negatives had been fired: the positives had also
taken an average of six more sick days a year.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This study may be distorted by more subtle
biases --related to race, age or gender --than those displayed by
the utility studies, according to Theodore H. Rosen, a
psychologist and a consultant on drug testing. Indeed, Jacques L.
Normand, who headed the study, acknowledges that minority postal
workers tested positive at a much higher rate than nonminority
workers and that previous studies have shown minorities to have
higher absenteeism.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Morgan points out, moreover, that the Postal
Service study (like all those cited above) has not been published
in a peer-reviewed journal. In fact, he says, only one study
comparing the work of drug-test positives and negatives has
passed peer review. Last year, in the JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL
MEDICINE, David C. Parish of the Mercer University School of
Medicine in Georgia reported on a study of 180 hospital
employees, 22 of whom had tested positive after being hired.
Parish examined supervisor evaluations and other indexes and
found &quot;no difference between drug-positive and drug-negative
employees&quot; at the end of one year. He noted, however, that
11 of the negatives had been fired during that period and none of
the positives.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Proponents of testing often imply that drug use
among workers is growing. A Hoffman-La Roche brochure, for
example, quotes Walsh pronouncing that &quot;the problem of drug
abuse has become so widespread in America that every company must
assume that its employees will eventually be faced with a
substance abuse problem.&quot; Yet in 1989 NIDA reported that
illegal drug use has been decreasing for 10 years and that the
decline has accelerated over the last five years. From 1985 to
1988 the number of current users (at least once in the last
month) of marijuana and cocaine dropped by 33 and 50 percent,
respectively.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To be sure, a subset of this group of current
users is increasing: NIDA estimated that from 1985 to 1988 the
number of people using cocaine at least once a week rose from
647,000 to 862,000 and daily users increased from 246,000 to
292,000. NIDA found that addiction to cocaine (including
&quot;crack&quot;) is particularly severe among the unemployed --
who are beyond the reach of workplace testing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Clearly, the U.S. has a drug-abuse problem.
Could it be that neither indiscriminate testing of workers --
which could cost upward of $500 million this year -- nor the
dissemination of alarmist information by testing advocates is
helping to resolve that problem? </font></p>

<h1><font size="3">FED PANEL SAYS VALUE OF WORKPLACE DRUG TESTING
UNPROVEN</font></h1>

<p><font size="3">Forensic Drug Abuse Advisor Vo. 7 (1) January
1995, p.6</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Subcommittees of the National Research Council
and the Institute of Medicine have completed a study assessing
the extent of drug use in the workplace, and the impact of drug
abuse on job performance. Drug testers may be a little upset by
some of its conclusions, since the study raises important
questions about the scientific rationale for workplace drug
testing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Workplace drug testing is a very big business.
The study group estimates that the United States is spending at
least 1.2 billion dollars per year on drug testing (24 million
tests per year at an estimated total cost of $50 each), not
counting any money spent on time lost from work attributable to
the testing process. Statistical evidence from a variety of
sources suggest that, except for alcohol, drug use in the
workplace has been steadily decreasing for the last 15 years (the
percentage of heavy drinkers in the population appears to be
unchanged). In 1990, the overall rate for workers admitting to
having used an illicit drug some time during the preceding month
was 7%. However, today in some areas, such as the air transport
and nuclear industry, the rate is well below 1%.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">No study has ever demonstrated that this
decrease is due to the work testing program, nor has it been
demonstrated with any certainty that, in commonly used doses, any
of the widely abused drugs significantly impacts on job
performance. There is, however, good evidence that drug users are
more likely to be absent from work, and there is also good
evidence that alcohol abuse is associated with increased
occupational injuries.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The committee felt that much of the data
reviewed for its report was flawed, or at least of dubious
statistical power, and they concluded that &quot;the preventive
effects of drug-testing programs have never been adequately
demonstrated.&quot; As Craig Zwerling pointed out in a recent
issue of JAMA, Journal of the American Medical Association (272
[18] 1467-1468), the conclusion reached by the study group was
the same as that reached in a 1992 study, namely that there was
&quot;almost no credible warrant of effectiveness.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Zwerling also went on to note that &quot;a
large industry of drug testers has arisen with a financial stake
in expanding the market for workplace drug tests. The industry
includes the companies that manufacture the equipment and
chemicals used in drug testing, the laboratories that carry out
the test, the companies that collect the urine specimens, the
medical review officers (MRO's) who review the test results, and
the consultants who advise companies on drug testing.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The study was sponsored by NIDA (National
Institute on Drug Abuse) and the results have been published in
book form by the National Academy Press. The full title is
&quot;Under the Influence? Drugs and the American Work
Force,&quot; Normand, J, Lempert, R, and O'Brien, C eds.
(Committee on Drug Use in the Workplace, National Research
Council / Institute of Medicine). 321 pp $39.95, ISBN
0-309-04885-0</font></p>

<p><font size="3">COMMENT: This book should be required reading.
Somebody has to do the studies to prove that the whole process
works. But who is going to put up the money to do the studies?
NIDA has just as big a vested interest in maintaining the status
quo as the drug testing companies, and the reagent manufacturers.
In fact, it may be too late to ever do the studies that would
justify the money and effort being spent on these programs. </font></p>

<h1><font size="3">THE DRUG - TEST SCAM</font></h1>

<p><font size="3">by Ian Williams Goddard</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Alas, the sorry sound of a Big Lie crashing: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The stereotype of the lazy, illicit-drug using
bum promotes an acceptance of claims that il- licit drug use
imposes heavy economic burdens upon businesses and society, and
consequently that universal drug testing is the most cost-
effective reaction to this unprofitable burden. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">But how true are these claims, which seem to
enjoy the support of reputable scientific re- search?Under
examination these claims are proven to be nothing more than a
greedy scam designed to expand the bureaucratic empires and
profits of a few by sacrificing the most fundamental liberties of
the many.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">ILLICIT DRUG USERS WORK MORE</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Contradicting the &quot;unproductive drug
user&quot; stereotype, while the National Household Sur- vey on
Drug Abuse [1] finds that 71% of il- licit-drug users are
employed, U.S. Depart- ment of Labor statistics [2] show that
only 65% of those 20 and over are employed. From the data we can
extrapolate that the aver- age illicit-drug user is more likely
to be employed than the average person [3].</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The evidence suggests that, while not favor-
able to police-state mega profits, the most true-to-life
stereotype could be: &quot;The pro- ductive and motivated drug
user.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Why might this be so? It's possible that the
desire for the reward of drug intoxication acts as astronger
incentive to work more (in an effort to earn the money necessary
to purchase the drug-reward) than non-drug rewards act as an
incentive for nonusers to work more. Such is Economics 101: the
higher the reward, the higher the output to acquire it; or, the
sweeter the carrot on the stick, the faster the horse will run
after it. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">ILLICIT DRUG USERS COST LESS &amp; WORK HARDER</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The journal SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN [4] cited a
study of workers at two utility companies: Utah Power &amp; Light
and Georgia Power Company. The workers who tested positive for
illicit drugs were found to (a) cost employers $215 less per
worker per year in health insurance, and (b) have a higher rate
of promotion. Work- ers testing positive for cannabis only had an
absentee rate 30% lower than average. The logical conclusion:
illicit users were less costly to employers while at the same
time being more productive and reliable. More for less! -- now
there's a deal.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE [5]
published a study that found &quot;no difference between
drug-positive and drug-negative em- ployees.&quot;However, the
study's author ob- served that during the study, 11 of the non-
users were fired while none of the users were fired. Ironically,
once the study end- ed, all of the users could have been fired
for using the &quot;wrong&quot; drugs, regardless of their
productivity and professionalism.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The claim that illicit-drug use costs busi-
nesses X billion dollars per year, is der- ived from a 1982 study
by the Research Tri- angle Institute. The study found that house-
holds with at least one member who used can- nabis daily at some
point in their life had a 28% lower income than the average
house- hold income. Yet the study also showed that those
currently using any illicit drug had an income equivalent to the
average [4]. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">If we conclude that because cannabis use pre-
ceded a lower income, therefore, cannabis use caused a lower
income(a post hoc ergo prop- ter hoc fallacy), then we must also
conclude based on the data that if you used cannabis in the past,
you should start using it again to increase your income to
current-user rates. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Interesting to note:if current drug users earn
more than former users, this supports the theory that drug
rewards are a more powerful incentive for work than nondrug
rewards.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">THE RIGGING OF RESEARCH</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In an effort to push Congress to pass manda-
tory illicit-drug-testing legislation, U.S. Chamber of Commerce
officials, in testimony before Congress, claimed that research
showed illicit-drug users were &quot;3.6 times more like- ly to
injure themselves or another person in a workplace
accident...[and] five times more likely to file a workers'
compensation claim.&quot; However, as SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN [4]
observed:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In fact, the study on which the claim is based
has &quot;nothing to do with [illicit] drug users,&quot;
according to a 1988 article in the University of Kansas Law Re-
view by John P. Morgan of the City University of New York Med-
ical School. Morgan, an author- ity on drug testing, has traced
the Chamber of Commerce claim to an informal study by the Fire-
stone Tire and Rubber Company of employees undergoing treatment
for alcoholism. ^^^^^^^^^^ Using the devastating effects of the
govern- ment subsidized drug alcohol to initiate a leg- islative
pogrom against safer, albeit, illicit drugs -- an obvious and
shameless scam. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">This scam is promoted not only by governmental
interests in an effort to expand bureaucratic empires,but also by
private interests in an effort to maximize profits, as the
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN observed: &quot;The pharmaceutical giant
Hoffman-La Roche, which is leading an anti- drug campaign among
businesses (and has a big share of the drug-testing market), also
promul- gates this claim in 'educational' literature.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN observed other errors in
the research promoted by the GovtMedia that purports to show that
drug users are bad for business. For example, a study that found
a higher absentee rate among users failed to note that most users
in the study were minor- ities, and minorities have an absentee
rate, regardless of drug use, identical to the rate observed in
the study.Logic therefore dic- tates, contrary to the GovtMedia's
conclusion, that NO statistically significant correlation between
drug use and absenteeism was found.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">CONCLUSIONARY OVERVIEW</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ultimately, the drug-testing and drug-rehab-
ilitation program is a massive cannabis-user- identification and
reeducation pogrom. This is because 90% of drug-positive urine
tests are for cannabis, which is due to the fact that inactive
metabolites of THC remain in the urine for up to 30 days after a
single use, whereas most other drugs are out of the system in a
day or even less. But why sacri- fice primary liberties for
cannabis control?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Not only is cannabis one of the safest known
drugs [6], and, as we have just observed, is correlated to better
employee performance, but there is no established correlation
bet- ween cannabis and motor-skill impairment; thus, unlike legal
alcohol, it cannot even be said to impair driving skills, which
is a major drug testing pretext. Observing the safety of cannabis
use, the National High- way Traffic Safety Administration [7]
said:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">No clear relationship has ever been
demonstrated between mari- juana smoking and either serious- ly
impaired driving performance or the risk of accident involve-
ment... [T]here is little if any evidence to indicate that
drivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely to
cause serious accidents than drug free drivers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The most exhaustive review of the research
clearly confirms that there is simply no compelling case for the
intrusive Orwellian surveillance of private activity that is im-
posed by drug testing.As Dr. John Morgan, director of
pharmacology at City University of New York Medical School,
wisely observed: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Urine testing is ... a method for surveillance,
not a tool for safety.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Indeed, drug testing is not about safety or job
performance; drug testing is a necessary feature of the
Surveillance State that is now being built around us to ensure
total cradle- to-grave surveillance and control of workers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">While it's been said that those who are will-
ing to give up liberty for safety will soon have neither,in the
case of illicit-drug testing -- which cannot even promise improv-
ed safety -- we can say that those who are willing to give up
liberty for nothing will soon have only that for which they
surrend- ered their priceless liberty: nothing. </font></p>

this give the illicit users an unfair advantage in this analysis?
No, because the EPR for ages 18-19 is roughly 1 to 3% lower than
for ages 20 and above (likely due to being in school);this lower
rate of employment for ages 18-19 would serve only to lower the
il- licit-user EPR results.Therefore, the inclu- sion of ages

<p><font size="4">URINALYSIS OR UROMANCY? THE UNTOLD COSTS OF
DRUG TESTING ABUSE</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dale Gieringer, Ph.D.,</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A paper for the Drug Policy Foundation
Published in &quot;Strategies for Change: New Directions in Drug
Policy (1992)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Among the impositions on personal privacy
introduced in the Reagan-Bush era, few are more intrusive but
less questioned than drug urinalysis. Relatively unknown at the
start of the eighties, urinalysis has now become a condition for
employment in over half of America's major companies, as well as
for insurance, child custody, security clearance, and freedom
from jail on probation or parole. While urinalysis has been
challenged by civil libertarians, courts have generally upheld it
in the face of strong public support. Opponents have objected
that drug testing is an unwarranted violation of privacy and a
search without probable cause, bu supporters have successfully
countered that the supposed hazards of drug abuse necessitate
urine testing. What is all too rarely challenged in this debate
is the scientific rationale of urinalysis as a means of detecting
drug abuse in the first place. The facts that urinalysis does not
detect whether someone is impaired or under the influence of
drugs; rather it detects the presence of non-psychoactive drug
metabolites that may linger in the system days or weeks after
use. In this respect urinalysis differs from the familiar alcohol
breathalyzer and blood tests, which detect whether one is
actually under the influence (as it turns out, alcohol is unique
in this regard: for other drugs, there is no simple relation
between impairment and concentration in bodily fluids). Thus it
is not only possible, but entirely likely that someone whose
urine tests positive for drugs is altogether competent and
unimpaired. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">As it happens, urinalysis is particularly
sensitive to marijuana, a single use of which can register
positive for as long as a week, long after any effects have
vanished; heavy users may register positive for as long as 4-6
weeks. Thus, urinalysis precludes even the most innocent, weekend
smoking of marijuana as &quot;drug abuse.&quot; Ironically,
urinalysis is considerably more tolerant of harder drugs such as
cocaine and heroin, which generally wash out in 2-3 days at most.
Other commonly used psychoactive drugs, including nicotine,
tranquilizers, and psychedelic drugs such as LSD are generally
not tested for.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Above all, urinalysis doesn't detect America's
number one drug of abuse, alcohol. Thus urinalysis in no way
assures a drug-free workplace. Instead, it encourages
substitution of alcohol and other non-tested drugs for marijuana,
cocaine, opiates and amphetamine.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Drug urinalysis is therefore an inherently
flawed technology. On one hand, it arbitrarily treats even the
most occasional marijuana users as &quot;drug abuse,&quot;
despite the substantial evidence that moderate marijuana use is
harmless. On the other hand, it ignores flagrant alcoholism. The
upshot is that urinalysis disqualifies many productive, competent
workers who enjoy non-traditional drugs in their free time, while
completely ignoring the majority of drug abusers, who are
alcoholics. All of this raises obvious questions about the value
of drug urinalylsis.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Morally, urinalysis can be compared to randomly
searching workers' homes and garbage cans and branding them
alcohol abusers if empty liquor bottles are found. Though it
might seem that Americans would strenuously object to such
warrantless searches of their homes, polls have shown strong
public support for searching their bladder contents, especially
in jobs deemed safety-critical.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">URINALYSIS: AN UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGY</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Despite the public support for drug testing,
urinalysis is a remarkably unproven technology. Were urinalysis a
life-saving new drug, it would have had to undergo years of
painstaking premarket testing in order to meet FDA regulations,
requiring it to be proven fully &quot;safe and effective&quot; in
rigorous, double-blind studies. Yet the fact is that urinalysis
has been imposed on millions of American workers involuntarily
without so much as a single scientifically controlled study to
show that it is a safe or effective means of promoting workplace
safety. Moreover, unlike drug consumers, urinalysis subjects
receive no warning labels informing them of what they are being
tested for, nor of the risks, accepted usage or implications of
the tests.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A close inspection of the evidence for drug
testing shows that it rests largely on exaggerated, distorted and
unfounded claims, as shown in critical reviews in Scientific
American and elsewhere. (1) For instance, testing advocates have
cited a Research Triangle Institute survey purporting to show
that the income loss due to marijuana use was some $26 billion;
yet the same data showed no difference at all in income between
non-users and current users of marijuana or other drugs. Other,
non-peer-reviewed studies by employers have likewise been
misinterpreted to support urinalysis: for instance, a pair of
studies at Utah Power and Light Co. and Georgia Power Co.
purporting to show that drug users pose a high risk of accidents
and absenteeism only looked at users who had exhibited problem
behavior on lthe job. Not surprisingly, this population had worse
than average work records. Nonetheless, Utah Power found thalt
drug users cost $215 less in health insurance benefits, while
Georgia Power found lower rates of absenteeism in workers who
tested positive only for marijuana!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only a handful of published studies have
compared the performance of drug-positive workers with others,
with similar, mixed results. A one-year follow-up study of 180
new employeees at a Georgia hospital found no relationship
between drug screen results and subsequent job performance. It
concluded, &quot;The data presently available do not support the
thesis that positive drug screening predicts poor job
performance.&quot; (2) Nonetheless, the U.S. government has
recently ordered random testing of its VA hospital employees. The
most extensive and widely cited research on workplace drug
testing comes from the U.S. Postal Service, which tracked the job
performance of new employees according to prior drug screen
results. Test results were not used in hiring decisions, but were
evaluated to determine their relation to job performance one year
later. The first study, which tracked the performance of 2533
postal workers in Boston, reported that drug-positive workers had
a statistically 50% higher rate of dismissals, reprimands,
injuries, accidents and absenteeism. (3) However, the authors
noted that this difference was &quot;much less than previously
estimated.&quot; Looked at another way, the Boston data actually
showed that the great majority of drug-positive users were
reliable: fully 86% of marijuana-positive workers were
discipline-free after one year, versus 91% for non-users; 74%
were accident-free, versus 81% for non-users; and 71% were still
on the job, versus 81% for non-users. Thus, on the average,
marijuana-positive workers were 90% as reliable as clean-urine
ones. Surprisingly, cocaine-positive workers fared even better,
being over 95% as reliable in most categories. The Boston
findings regarding accidents and injuries were subsequently
contradicted by a second, larger, study of 4,396 postal workers
nationwide, which found no relation at all between drug test
results and injuries or accidents. (4) The Boston accident
findings had previously been criticized on methodological
grounds. The second Postal Service study did find that those who
tested positive for illicit drugs had a 50% higher rate of
absenteeism and dismissals. Yet once again, they showed that
drug-using workers were largely reliable: drug users had a 93.4%
attendance record, versus 95.8% for others, and 85% of users kept
their jobs, versus 89.5% of non-users.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Boston data were later analyzed in a
cost-benefit study, which found that drug screening would be
marginally economical, to the tune of about $162 per
drug-positive worker rejected. (5) However, the authors cautioned
that these results were highly sensitive to variations in the
extent of drug use and cost of urine testing, and that there were
likely to be many situations where drug testing was not
cost-effective. They concluded that companies &quot;should
carefully weigh the costs and benefits&quot; in their particular
industry. Had the authors examined the second Post Service study,
they would presumably have found even slimmer benefits from urine
testing, since there would have been no savings from accidents or
injuries. Furthermore, their analysis undoubtedly overstated the
potential value of drug urine testing, since they assumed that
all drug-positive workers would be screened out. In practice,
however, drug-using workers are apt to avoid detection, either by
discontinuing use temporarily beforehand or by other evasion
techniques described below. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">VICTIMS OF URINALYSIS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">While the benefits of drug testing to employers
appear dubious and unproven, the costs to the workforce have
scarcely been examined at all. Nonetheless, it is clear that
urinalysis imposes significant costs on workers. To begin with,
it forces millions of innocent employees to submit to scrutiny of
intimate bodily fluids in a way that many regard as degrading and
obnoxious. This is especially trying for the unfortunate minority
sufering &quot;blushing kidneys,&quot; who are unable to produce
urine on demand. At least one urinalysis victim has even been
hospitalized for water poisoning after being required to drink
three liters of water in order to make her give urine. (6)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Urinalysis is especially burdensome and
offensive to those otherwise responsible, productive workers who
do not abuse drugs on the job but enjoy indulging them in their
free time at home. Principal among these are the nation's 20 or
30 million marijuana users, the great majority of whom are
occasional users. (7) Due to the oversensitivity of urine tests
to marijuana, pot smokers constitute the great majority of
urinalysis victims: up to 90% of drug-positive test results are
for marijuana. (8) Urinalysis forces these workers either to give
up a valued pleasure, or to risk losing employment, insurance, or
other benefits and rights.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">California NORML (National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws) is one of several organizations
offering drug testing advice via a telephone hotline, over which
we have received scores of complaints from victims of drug
testing abuse. Included are truck drivers, airline attendants,
office workers, mechanics, nurses and other employees with
impeccable work records, who have lost long-held jobs on account
of their urine chemistry, often against the wishes of their own
supervisors and co-workers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One urinalysis victim, Mike Beatty, says he
lost $500,000 in Air Force retirement benefits after discharged
for using marijuana solely on the evidence of one bad urine test.
Beatty says that he used to smoke pot regularly, but like most
fellow servicemen gave it up when urine testing was instituted.
Nonetheless, he relates, he continued to socialize with pot
smokers, and had the misfortune of accidentally consuming a
marijuana brownie at a party shortly before a drug test. Beatty
says that before his discharge he was &quot;humiliated&quot; by
Air Force personnel with sexual aspersions and investigations
into his wife's private sex life.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another urinalysis victim named Don was fired
from an ARCO truck driving job after 19 years on the job.
&quot;It didn't even occur to me that I had a problem.&quot; he
said. &quot;I thought they were looking for coke.&quot; Don, who
had an excellent work record and seniority, complains that ARCO
never explained the implications of its drug testing policy.
After losing his job and pension benefits, he was forced to sell
his house and settlle for a much lower-paying job. &quot;You can
count me as a victim of drug testing,&quot; he says.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Jim is outstanding at what he does,&quot;
reads the employee evaluation file of another urinalysis victim,
a tractor trailer driver who was fired under Department of
Transportation drug testing regulations. &quot;Excellent safe
driving awareness,&quot; &quot;great initiative,&quot;
&quot;demonstrated dedication and consistency,&quot; read other
testimonials in Jim's file. Jim, who admits t being a weekend
marijuana smoker, was fired after five lyears on the job despite
having the highest possible job safety rating with his company.
&quot;My employer couldn't believe it,&quot; says another woman
who was fired from a job with a major retail store after failing
a surprise drug test. Like many other drug testing victims, the
woman was tested after being &quot;promoted&quot; to a higher
position.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Drug testing has destroyed my attitude
towards my job and my government,&quot; says another utility
worker, who was forced into an &quot;employee assistance
program&quot; for a positive urine test. &quot;They treat me like
a drug addict,&quot; he says, echoing the complaint of many pot
smokers, &quot;and they go home and get drunk every night.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">DEALING WITH DRUG TESTS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The most common question received on the
California NORML hotline is how to deal with a urine test for
marijuana. The most obvious advice is to abstain from suspect
substances before the test. Many callers are surprised to learn
that occasional, weekend use typically washes out in as few as
2-5 days. Most regular smokers commonly pass within a couple of
weeks, though very heavy use can be detected for as long as six
weeks. However, exceptions can occur. NORML has heard from
callers who have reported flunking as long as 10 days after a
single, isolated use, while other, regular smokers have been
known to pass within hours of last use. Such reports only
emphasize the essential capriciousness and unreliability of drug
urinalysis.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For pot smokers facing drug tests on short
notice, the simplest and most effective advice is to drink large
volumes of liquids immediately before the test. The purpose of
this is to dilute the concentration of drug metabolites in the
urine below the threshold of detection (usually 100 nanograms per
milliliter for the commonly used EMIT test). Test subjects are
also advised to avoid giving urine that has accumulated in the
bladder overnight, since this tends to be high in metabolites.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Although reliable information on urinalysis
evasion is hard to come by, reports from underground
investigators agree that urine dilution can be quite effective.
Most regular smokers are able to pass within a week or two, and
sometimes much sooner, though exceptions occur. (9) Dilution can
be boosted by taking diuretics, which stimulate urination;
however, the most effective of these are available only on
prescription. A number of diets and wash-out regimes have been
proposed for persons who have several days to prepare; however,
none of these have been scientifically validated. It is possible
for laboratories to detect dilute urine by special tests for
specific gravity, creatanin content, etc.; however, such tests
are expensive and rarely used. On rare occasion, subjects are
asked to take a second test after submitting a sample that has
been found to be too watery. Of course, this gives them more time
to clear up.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Becuase urine dilution is far from 100%
reliable, especially for regular users caught unawares, there is
a natural demand for surer methods. Many users experiment with
oral &quot;drug screens&quot; that are rumored to avert positive
urine tests. Included are certain vitamins, vinegar, zinc
sulfate, and goldenseal root, as well as some overpriced special
formulas and herb teas sold on the underground market. Despite
glowing testimonials from some lucky users, these nostrums have
no good scientific foundation and have been found to be
unreliable in underground investigations.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A more reliable, if ethically dubious, way to
foil urine tests is to furtively tamper with the sample. One
popular trick is to adulterate the sample with one of a number of
household products that are known to interfere with the common
EMIT test so as to produce a false negative for marijuana. (10)
Popular adulterants include detergent, salt, bleach and Drano
crystals, which can be concealed under the fingernails. However,
such substances may be detectable by sight or smell by diligent
lab technicians. A more sophisticated, less easily detected
adulterant is currently sold on lthe underground market. (11) and
has been proven to be quite reliable at producing false negatives
for marijuana (the manufacturer was compelled to move operations
when the Texas legislature passed a bill outlawing sale of urine
adulterants) (12)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another, more cumbersome trick is to substitute
clean urine for one's own when delivering the sample. A
surprising number of American workers appear to have rigged
themselves up with substitute urine samples by methods elaborated
in Abby Hoffman's book, &quot;Steal This Urine Test.&quot; (13)
In order to discourage such cheating, many labs now measure the
temperature of each sample.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another, surer safeguard against tampering is
to require that subjects be carefully observed during urination.
However, aside from the armed forces and criminal justice system,
few testers resort to such extreme measures. Most tests
accordingly provide leeway for evasive sleights of hand. One
regrettable side-effect of drug testing is thus to favor those
more unscrupulous drug users who are willing to resort to
tampering and similar evasion techniques, whereas honest users
must either give up or face the risk of being fired. In a similar
way, dishonesty is favored on questionnaires asking about illicit
drug use: those drug users who are honest about their use are
routinely turned down, with the result that only dishonest users
are hired.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">PRE-EMPLOYMENT TESTS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In general, the common pre-employment urine
screen is by far the easiest kind of test to deal with, insofar
as prospective employees need only avoid incriminating substances
for the time they are on the job market. However, a surprising
number of ignorant job applicants are unaware that they should be
prepared for urine tests in the first place. Most pot smokers
appear to have little problem abstaining for job tests, given the
low addictiveness of marijuana. Only rarely has California NORML
encountered long-term heavy users who complain of difficulty in
giving up pot for a while.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Nonetheless, pre-employment tests can still be
a problem even for moderate users if they happen to encounter a
surprise job opportunity. In addition, many companies require
drug screens of employees when they are promoted. As a result,
many workers whose efforts have won them a promotion end up being
fired instead on account of bad urine chemistry. Employees may
also face urine tests unexpectedly when their company is sold to
new management. In such cases, the new owners may demand a sudden
spot urine check of the entire workforce, effectively purging it
of anyone who has had the bad luck to indulge a suspect substance
too recently. Victims of such abuses generally have no legal
recourse against dismissal, and can also expect to lose
unemployment benefits.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">NORML has heard from many otherwise blameless
pot smokers who have lost jobs thanks to drug testing. Few cases
better illustrate the absurd lengths to which urinalysis is
carried than that of a newly &quot;promoted&quot; radio
programmer who found himself fired for a positive marijuana test.
The employee, who admitted to being a weekend pot smoker, had
been working for a San Francisco &quot;60's golden oldies&quot;
FM station!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Many NORML callers complain of having been
coerced into drug testing programs they don't understand or
approve of, with little explanation of how the policy will be
administered. &quot;It was very manipulative,&quot; recounts one
woman concerning her employer's efforts to make her sign a form
consenting to urinalysis. &quot;They told us of course we
wouldn't be randomly tested; we would only be tested on
cause,&quot; she relates, &quot;But the form specifically stated
we would agree to random testing.&quot; Many employees receive no
disclosure statements at all, leaving them vulnerable to
arbitrary decisions. Some workers complain of being fired for a
single bad test, after being given the impression that they would
be eligible for a rehabilitation program instead. Many employees
complain about being &quot;singled out&quot; for drug tests
because they are unpopular with their supervisor or manager.
Others report being told by their managers that they will be
protected from urine tests because they are valued employees.
Some employees receive advance warning about impending tests,
giving them time to prepare; others are taken by surprise.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Because blood and urine samples are used for
many other medical tests, subjects do not necessarily know when
they are being drug tested. A Nevada mother told the NORML
hotline that she had been unwittingly blood-tested for marijuana
in a maternity ward, in what she had been told was a blood test
for AIDS. She said her family was subsequently visited by
plainclothes police demanding that they refer their newborn to a
hospital ward for drug-addicted babies, or else give up custody.
Another woman relates giving a urine specimen for what she was
told was a pre-employment drug test, and losing the job when the
employer inspected it to find out that whe was pregnant instead!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Continued)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">URINALYSIS OR UROMANCY PART II</font></p>

<p><font size="3">RANDOM URINALYSIS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">By far the most dreaded and intrusive form of
drug testing is the random test, which is specifically designed
to take workers by surprise. Under random testing, workers may be
called on to provide a urine sample at any time, typically on no
more than an hour or two's notice (however, in some shops,
workers have been known to receive as much as a weeks' advance
alert). A corollary of random urinalysis is to prevent workers
from using any marijuana, even at home on weekends, at the risk
of losing their jobs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">While private employers have tended to shy wawy
from random testing on grounds of expense, government drug
warriors have successfully campaigned to impose random testing
through federal regulations. Random urinalysis is now required
for the military, many public employees and contractors, and the
nation's entire interstate transportation workforce -- including
not only airline pilots, train engineers and truck drivers, but
also flight attendants, mechanics, and gas pipeline workers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The NORML hotline receives many complaints
about random testing from transportation workers. Most not only
resent the intrusion on their private lives, but also insist that
illicit drug abuse is not a safety problem. &quot;Alcohol is the
worst abused drug, especially pilots,&quot; says one angry flight
attendant, a view repeatedly expressed by others in the industry.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">According to air industry spokesmen, not a
single passenger airline crash had been attributed to alcohol or
drug abuse. (14) Administration officials lamely pointed to a
1988 plane crash in Durango, Colorado, in which the pilot's blood
showed evidence of cocaine use. Yet investigators determined that
the pilot was not high at the time of the crash, and it was the
co-pilot who was controlling the plane at the time of the crash!
(15) The fact that drug testing is widely opposed by the very
airline workers whose lives are most at stake would seem to raise
obvious questions about the supposed dangers of drug abuse in the
air industry.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Drug testing of transportation workers was
mandated by Congress in response to a highly publicized 1987
train collision in which 16 passengers were killed. (16) The
accident was blamed on the negligence of an engineer and
brakeman, who were determined to have been smoking marijuana
shortly before the crash. A subsequent investigation revealed
that both men had an extensive record of drunken driving offenses
and were known to be problem drinkers. Furthermore, some of the
train's safety equipment had been disabled. The engineer admitted
to culpability for ignoring warning signals, but denied that
marijuana had anything to do with the accident. An investigation
by the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the
railroad should undertake management reforms and equipment
improvements, but did not recommend drug testing. Nonetheless,
Transportation Secretary James Burnley argued for drug testing,
pointing to evidence that a significant percentage of
accident-involved rail personnel tested positive for drugs. (17)
In fact, however, Federal Railroad Administration statistics
showed that only 4-6% of &quot;reasonable cause&quot; urine tests
were positive for drugs or alcohol, (18) half of what might have
been expected for a normal cross-section of the workforce! (19)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The ultimate impact of random testing
regulations remains to be seen, as testing is still being phased
in within the transportation industry. Many workers have
responded by adjusting their drug use, however grudgingly. Others
persist in risking a urine positive, relying on one or another
evasion techniques to minimize their risks. Relatively few are
actually caught: airlines report fewer than 1% of employees test
urine positive. (20) Included are an unfortunate number of very
occasional users: NORML has heard from more than one flight
attendant dismissed for indulging a rare joint with an old
friend.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Many workers report turning to alcohol as a
substitute for marijuana. &quot;I'm drinking a lot more
now,&quot; says one trucker, echoing a common complaint of many
drug-tested workers who say they use pot to control alcoholism.
Other drug-tested workers report widespread alcohol abuse among
their fellows: &quot;You see guys stumbling in here drunk from
the management on down,&quot; says a Customs employee,
&quot;There are guys drinking alcohol first thing in the
morning.&quot; Another employee told NORML that workers at his
job had started smoking heroin instead of pot. Meanwhile, in the
military, LSD is said to have become the illicit drug of choice
due to its relative undetectability. (21) It is tempting to
speculated that recent reports of a parallel upsurge in alcohol
and LSD use among young persons reflect a broader social trend
created by the incentives of drug urinalysis. (22)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">URINALYSIS: &quot;ON-CAUSE&quot; OR NO CAUSE?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In many workplaces, employees are subject to
&quot;on-cause&quot; testing whenever they have an accident.
While such testing might seem unobjectionable, it is often abused
so as to inculpate innocent workers. For instance, a diesel
mechanic told NORML that he had been ordered to take a urine test
following a minor workplace accident on a Friday, and that his
drug test was scheduled for Monday, three days after the
accident. The worker was rightly concerned that he might be fired
because he had recently smoked marijuana at home. Ironically,
however, three days would have been ample time to pass the test
had he actually been under the influence of any other
drug--cocaine, heroin, alcohol or speed--at the time of the
accident!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In another case, a woman reported that her
husband, a print shop worker with eight years' seniority, had
flunked a drug test for marijuana after receiving a minor finger
cut in an accident caused by another worker. Not only was her
husband fired for an accident that wasn't his fault, but the
family also lost health insurance coverage for their son, who had
serious medical problems costing $1200 per month. Like other
urine testing victims, the woman charged that the company had
financial motivations to fire her husband, namely the family's
insurance costs. Urinalysis abuse is a phenomenon that extends
beyond the job market. For instance, some insurance companies
require drug urinalysis as part of their physical exams.
Applicants are routinely denied insurance if they are found to
use marijuana, despite the fact that there is not an iota of
actuarial evidence showing marijuana adversely affects life
expectancy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Urinalysis has also come to figure in custody
battles between estranged couples. One husband told California
NORML that he had been directed by a court to submit to
urinalysis after his wife had accused him of being a marijuana
smoker, a condition widely presumed to compromise parental
fitness. He complained that he was given no time to prepare for
the test, despite the fact that his wife, who had demanded the
test, had three weeks to prepare a clean sample of her own.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another arena where urinalysis is widely abused
is the prison system, where it is often imposed indiscriminately
as a condition of probation or parole. As a result, many
non-violent offenders face substantial prison time for simply
smoking a joint. For instance, a California woman with a long
history of medical marijuana use for migraines was sentenced to 8
months in jail on charges of marijuana transportation. The judge
explained that he could not give her a suspended sentence because
in that case she would be subject to drug testing, which she
would almost certainly fail, thereby ending up with a substantial
sentence. Drug use violations have been reported to constitute
45% of all parole violations in California, which in turn account
for nearly half of all prison admissions. (23) The use of
marijuana screening appears especially dubious in light of the
fact that marijuana tends to suppress violence, whereas the
nearest substitute, alcohol, tends to aggravate it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">California NORML has heard from several medical
marijuana patients with drug testing problems. &quot;Pot makes me
feel better,&quot; complains a government worker with psoriatic
arthritis, &quot;I can't take alcohol.&quot; Other patients are
threatened with drug testing programs following convictions for
marijuana offenses. Although marijuana is not an approved
medication, patients may be able to pass urinalysis by obtaining
a prescription for Marinol, the government-approved synthetic
marijuana substitute. Since Marinol reacts exactly like
marijuana, patients could presumably obtain a medical exemption
for a positive urine test. Unfortunately, however, prescriptions
for Marinol are not easy to come by and federal regulations
forbid its use outside of cancer chemotherapy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One common concern about drug testing is the
danger of &quot;false positives,&quot; in which subjects are
erroneously accused of drug use. Contrary to rumor, neither
passive smoking nor drug interactions are likely to cause false
marijuana positives. Only in the most unlikely conditions, such
as sitting for hours on end in a closet full of heavy pot
smokers, has passive smoking been shown to produce a level of
urine metabolites high enough to be detected on the standart EMIT
test. (24) Likewise, no drug is known to cause a false positive
for marijuana, but certain over-the-counter medicines can trigger
the test for amphetamines and poppy seeds can be confused with
opiates (it used to be that ibuprofen interfered somewhat with
marijuana tests, but this problem has been fixed). (25) Such
problems are supposed to be sorted out by medical review
officers, the reliability of whom can only be speculated on.
However, NORML has not heard any complaints about false positives
from drug interactions.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The important question remains whether false
positives may be caused by lab error. Early surveys of drug
testing labs reported remarkably high error rates. However,
industry and government have taken steps to insure against false
positives for the sake of public credibility and liability. By
requiring accurate gas chromatograph confirmation tests of
positive samples and regulating the chain of custody, selected
labs have demonstrated false positive rates as low as zero in
10,000 -- 48,000 samples in proficiency tests (false negatives,
in which drug use is not detected, run around 3%) (26)
Nonetheless, given the profusion of unregulated labs, higher
error rates may well be common. It should be noted that even if
false positives occur in as few as one in 100,000 tests, hundreds
of Americans per year can expect to be falsely branded as illicit
drug users.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">California NORML has heard from three or four
persons claiming to be victims of &quot;false positives&quot; for
marijuana. Claims of this kind are by nature suspicious and
difficult to verify. On one occasion, however, I personally
observed what appeared to be a serious lapse of security in a
local clinic that administers drug tests to probationers for
local corrections authorities. I had come there to have some
experimental specimens tested, and was told to place them on a
shelf. While I waited for an attendant to record and label the
samples, a nurse came in and deposited another unlabeled specimen
jar on the shelf next to mine. Had I not brought the situation to
the attendant's attention, it would have been child's play to
switch and mislabel the samples by error or mischief.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">UROMANCY: AN OBSOLESCENT TECHNOLOGY?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The full toll of drug urine victims has yet to
be scientifically investigated. Nothing is known about the number
of false positives, nor the number of responsible workers
disqualified for urine positives, nor the costs to their
families, the economy, and welfare roles, nor the extent to which
drug urinalysis has aggravated abuse of alcohol, tobacco and
other untested drugs. As for the purported benefits of testing,
these too are unclear. Given the potential for drug substitution,
however, it may be doubted whether they will prove significant.
Indeed, a pair of recent studies suggest that the recent decline
in marijuana use has led to an increase in drug-abuse emergencies
and auto fatalities due to alcohol and other drugs. (27)
Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics lhas reported a jump in
job-related sickness and injuries to a record 6.8 million in
1990, or 8.8 out of 100 workers, the highest rate since 1979,
before drug testing began! All of this raises obvious questions
about the purported benefits of drug urinalysis. Insofar as the
evidence for drug testing rests more on faith than science, it
might aptly be called &quot;uromancy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The case for drug urinalysis is further
undermined by the fact that there exist alternative means for
detecting impairment. Most promising of these are performance
tests, which measure reaction time, alertness, and agility at
various tasks. Computer-based performance tests are now on the
market and have started to be used in some workplaces. (28)
Performance tests have the obvious advantage of measuring actual
impairment, regardless of the cause. Unlike urinalysis, they can
detect problems caused by alcohol and other, untested drugs, as
well as stress, fatigue, and emotional distress. In addition,
they have the important advantage of disregarding private
behavior that is irrelevant to job performance.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another, often ignored alternative to
urinalysis is blood testing. Although blood tests are even more
physically invasive than urine tests, they provide a much better
indication of current impairment, since they detect the active
presence of psychoactive drugs in the system rather than inactive
urinemetabolites. Because blood tests are less sensitive to
behaviorally irrelevant, past drug use than urine tests, they are
commonly used in forensic studies of accident victimes to
determine whether the subject was under the influence of drugs.
Unfortunately, blood tests are at best an imperfect indicator of
intoxication for drugs other than alcohol, and it is impossible
to determine fixed thresholds for impairment. In the case of
marijuana, THC blood levels decline quite rapidly to negligible
levels in as little as two hours for occasional lusers, although
chronic users can manifest detectable levels for a couple of
days. Blood tests may therefore offer a useful way for occasional
drug users to establish their innocence of being under the
influence. The case can be made that any worker accused of
on-the-job drug abuse should have the option of taking a blood or
impairment test to prove his or her competence (in California,
motorists accused of driving under the influence of drugs have
the option of blood or urine tests; unfortunately, few if any
drivers understand the dramatic differences in sensitivit;y
between the two).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another, more sinister alternative to
urinalysis is hair testing, which is even more sensitive to past
drug use than urinalysis. Promoters claim to detect drug use for
months and even years, far longer than any pharmacological impact
on health. Despite the fact that hair testing has unresolved
technical problems and is considered to be an unproven technology
by the scientific community, (29) it is already being marketed
and used by some private employers and has been boosted by
federal officials like Drug Czars William Bennett and Bob
Martinez. The one advantage of hair testing is that is is less
invasive of bodily privacy than blood or urine testing, although
some persons, such as those of the Sikh religion, object to
having their hair disturbed. However, because hair testing is
also much more indiscriminate than other technologies in
distinguishing harmless drug use from abuse, it poses enen
greater potential costs to society, the economy, and civil
liberties.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The choice betwee hair testing and performance
testing marks a crucial crossroads for the nation's drug policy.
While the outcome remains to be seen, there are good reasons to
think that urine and hair testing will eventually be rejected for
all but forensic purposes, given their basic inability to measure
competence. Drug urine testing is perhaps best understood as a
tool for imposing social conformity that has aptly been described
as &quot;chemical McCarthyism.&quot; (30) Like the loyalty oath
of the fifties, urinalysis seeks to impose &quot;politically
correct&quot; attitudes in the workforce. As drugs have replaced
Communism as domestic enemy number one, so the question,
&quot;Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist
party?&quot; has been replaced by, &quot;Are you now or have you
been the user of a controlled substance?&quot; When the current
anti-drug hysteria subsides, the absurdity of this question will
become apparent.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Technologically, drug urine testing can best be
compared to that other tool of McCarthyism, the polygraph. Like
the polygraph, drug testing rests on the spurious premise that
the human mind can be read via crude physiological measures. Like
the polygraph, drug testing is inherently misleading and
endangers innocent parties. Time has revealed the polygraph to be
an essentially flawed technology, and it has now been outlawed
for most purposes (ironically, by the very same Congress that
eagerly embraced random urinalysis). In the fullness of time, it
can be expected that the same will happen to drug urinalysis. As
the costs of drug testing are examined more closely, it is apt to
be seen that human beings are best judged by their perormance,
not the chemicals in their urine.</font></p>

<h1><font size="3">Meta-Analysis of Adolescent Crime and
Substance Use, 1981-1995</font></h1>

<p><font size="3">Gordon E. Kenney, Ph.D. The University of
Memphis Memphis, Tennessee, USA 38152 </font><a
href="mailto:gkenney@memphis.edu"><font size="3">gkenney@memphis.edu</font></a></p>

<p><font size="3">December, 1996</font></p>

<p><font size="3">INTRODUCTION </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The use of psychoactive substances has been
cited by drug enforcement officials as a cause of criminal
behavior. Apart from the manufacture, sale, and/or delivery of
illicit substances, substance *use* has been regarded as a
primary precipitant of criminal behavior, especially violent
behavior (e.g., Drug Enforcement Administration, 1994). To date,
however, it seems that such assertions have been based on
anecdotal evidence, with little, if any, empirical support. Even
data from the federal government fails to support such a link.
For example, during 9 contemporaneous reporting periods between
1972 and 1990, the correlations between adolescent (ages 17 and
younger) violent, property, and overall crime rates and mean
adolescent (ages 12-17) usage rates for 10 substances (both licit
and illicit) were .09, .27, and .20, respectively (Federal Bureau
of Investigation, 1972-90; National Institute on Drug Abuse,
1991). These correlations can hardly be viewed as suggestive of
any meaningful relationships between crime and substance use.
Such evidence, however, is circumstantial. Other indicators are
needed to establish any real relationship, whether large or
small, between crime and drug use.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The purpose of this study was to excavate the
body of recent scholarly research in this domain for any evidence
concerning the role of substance use in criminal acts perpetuated
by adolescents and to summarize these findings using
meta-analysis (Wolf, 1986).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">METHOD &amp; PROCEDURES </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Scholarly research products of a primary nature
were gleaned from social science databases (including
Dissertation Abstracts International, Educational Resources
Information Clearinghouse, PsycLit, and metropolitan Memphis,
Tennessee, book holdings). The search was limited to studies
concerning adolescent criminology reported between 1981 and 1995.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Resultant inferential statistics from each
study pertaining to general delinquency, reoffense, and/or
violence as each related to substance use were converted to
effect sizes in the form of r using Wolf's (1986) formulae. The r
statistic, here used as an effect size, remains essentially a
correlation coefficient which ranges from -1.0 to +1.0, where
-1.0 constitutes a perfect negative relationship, +1.0
constitutes a perfect positive relationship, and 0.0 constitutes
absolutely no relationship. A squared correlation coefficient
(r^2) represents the percentage of shared variance among the
variables in question.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">RESULTS </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Fifteen (15) primary research studies were
found which met the aforementioned criteria (see Table 1). Of
these, 13 were conducted in 10 states in the United States, and 2
were conducted in Canada. There were 6 research articles from
refereed journals, 6 dissertations/theses, 2 unpublished
conference research presentations, and 1 unpublished research
report. A total of 3,583 adolescent offenders were involved in
these 15 studies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The mean unweighted r for the relationship
between adolescent crime and substance use was .22 (df = 13, not
significant), with a median of .17, and a range of .00 to .68.
The amount of shared variance between overall adolescent crime
and substance use was about 5%. The strength of these effect size
estimates was considered low.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only 4 of the studies investigated the
relationship between adolescent violent crime and substance use
(total number of offenders studied was 834). The mean unweighted
r for these studies was .10 (df = 13, not significant), with a
median of .08, and a range of .07 to .15. The amount of shared
variance between violent adolescent crime and substance use was
1%. These effect size estimates were considered very low.</font></p>

range of .00 to .68. This effect size was considered low. The
effect sizes based on geography were not considered to be
substantially different.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Gender, ethnocultural heritage, property
crimes, and particular substances used were not evaluated because
these variables were seldom noted in more than a few of the
selected studies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">CONCLUSIONS The relationship between adolescent
crime and substance use was found to be small. Overall, substance
use accounted for only about 5% of the variance associated with
overall adolescent criminal behavior, and less than 1% of the
variance associated with adolescent violent behavior. These
findings were remarkably similar to those involving federal
government data noted earlier. Neither temporal nor geographic
patterns were observed concerning the effect size estimates
reported in the 15 studies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Therefore, assertions about the precipitous
role of substance use in adolescent crime do not appear to be
supported by the body of recent scholarly research in this area.
Similar investigations concerning adult crime and substance use
are warranted before any definite conclusions may be reached
about this controversial issue. It is clear, however, that
adolescent substance use, though a crime in and of itself, is not
fundamentally related to broader indices of adolescent crime.</font></p>

<h1><font size="3">1994 American Management Survey on workplace
drug testing.</font></h1>

<hr>

<p><font size="3">The following is taken from the 1994 American
Management Survey on workplace drug testing. (Unpublished)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The survey responses are for January 1994 and
represent the American Management Association (AMA's) corporate
membership of 7000 U.S. organizations, which employ in total a
quarter of the American workforce.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">According to the survey. . . . </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The percentage of companies that drug test
employees rose from 84.8 % (January 1993) to 87.2% (January 1994)
This represents an increase of over 300% since 1987.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Business category is the most important factor
in the occurrence of testing programs. The two categories most
likely to test are manufacturing firms (93%) and transportation
companies (92%). Size also plays a role -- 91% of organizations
with more than 1000 employees test, though smaller ones aren't
far behind (81%). Geographically, there are fairly substantial
variations too: companies in the desert and mountain states of
the West are the most likely to test (91%), while companies in
New England are the least likely (68%).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">53% of companies that test do so under
government mandate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The test-positive rate, which had fallen
steadily since 1989, levelled in 1993, at 2.5%. The AMA
attributes this not to lesser use, but to the fact that
test-positives rates fell consistently only as the testing pool
increased -- the levelling in 1993 and 1994 reflects the
levelling in the growth of testing programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There is a direct correlation between the
increase in testing and the decrease in test-positive rates.
According to the AMA, this is not because testing acts as a
deterrent to drug use, but rather because as more employees are
being tested for reasons other than suspicion of use, the
test-positive rate would naturally fall.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Among companies that perform random testing,
the 1993 test-positive rate was 2.1%. Among those companies that
test only for cause, the rate was 11.1%.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Companies that offer drug education programs as
well as testing have lower test-positive rates than those that
provide only testing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only 5% of companies neither test employees nor
offer drug education programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Action on test-positive employees: 31% of
companies dismiss test-positives, and more than half of these
offer no other alternative. The rest regard firing as a last
resort, after counselling and disciplinary actions have been
trlied.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">68% of companies test new hires. Tests are
rarely given as part of the application process per se; instead
testing occurs when the applicant has already been offered the
job. The offer is then conditional on the applicant passing the
test. 1% of companies that test new hires will hire
test-positives on a probationary basis; 95% specifically state
that test-positives will not be hired, the rest take other
actions, such as retesting at a later date. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">METHODS -- 82.1% use urine testing. 12.9% use
blood testing. 1.1% use hair testing. 0.9% use performance
testing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Of those who use urine testing, only 70% retest
an initial positive with a more rigorous, confirmatory test. 13%
repeat the same procedure on the same sample. 5% take and test a
new sample. 7% perform no validation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only 79% of those that urine test use
NIDA-certified labs. Only 48% use a medical review officer (MRO)
to analyze test findings, judge them against the testee's medical
history, and render a verdict.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only 6% of firms that test pay lower insurance
premiums because of their programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;It may seem reasonable to assume that
drug testing has a deterrent effect on drug use. . . . However,
no finding of this eight-year AMA survey effort can confirm as a
statistical certainty that testing does in fact deter use. . . .
Testing cannot and should not be expected to take the place of
good supervision. The American Management Association has
consistently advised that. . . . Actions regarding employee
discipline be performance-based.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">SIMPLE WAY TO BEAT URINE TESTS -- JUST DRINK
WATER</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Report from American Academy of Forensic
Sciences</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Forensic Drug Abuse Advisor, Vol. 6, Issue 3,
March 1994</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Workplace drug testing programs can be foiled
by adulterating the specimen, and the adulterants can be added
inside or outside of the body. Last summer it became apparent
that many peole were cheating by adding solutions of concentrated
glutaraldehyde (Urinaid) to their voided sample. New data,
presented in February at the annual meeting of the American
Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS), suggests that there is a
simpler way to foil urine screening tests: drink lots of water.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Edward Cone of the Addiction Research
Center (ARC) in Baltimore, described the results of a study he
had undertaken at the request of Donna Smith, Acting Director of
the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Office of Drug
Enforcement. Smith was concerned that advertising claims for some
herbal teas and &quot;internal cleansing&quot; agents might
actually be true. Cone was at first skeptical, but, as he
reported at the AAFS meeting, the study was a
&quot;sleeper.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cone set up a series of experiments designed to
assess the effect of various measures on &quot;in vivo
adulteration.&quot; Two of the most popular &quot;teas&quot; were
chosen for study; Naturally Klean Herbal Tea&quot; and
&quot;Golden Seal&quot; root capsules. Healthy drug-free
volunteers with a history of recent drug use were recruited for
the study. They were housed in a closed ward for six weeks. The
participants were tested under a number of different protocols
during that six week period.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At 9:00 AM on the morning of Day One the study
subjects smoked a standardized marijuana cigarette (3.58% THC).
On Day Three they snorted 40 mg of cocaine. Twenty three hours
after each drug was given, they drank one of the following
combinations: (1) &quot;Naturally Klean Herbal Tea&quot; in one
gallon of water, (2) one gallon of water without any
&quot;cleansing agent&quot; (3) one gallon of water with 50 mg of
hydrochlorothiadize (a diuretic), (4) four &quot;Golden
Seal&quot; capsules and one gallon of water, or (5) twelve ounces
of water. Each participant was tested under each protocol and all
of the urine was collected.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The urine specimens were then tested by EMIT II
assay for cannabinoids at a 50 ng / ml cutoff, and cocaine at a
300 ng / ml cutoff. Specific gravity and creatinine content was
measured for each sample, and the two indicators were found to
co-vary almost identically. Just drinking 12 ounces of water was
enough to cause a significant decrease in both specific gravity
and creatinine, but not enough to cause a negative test response.
For example, urine cannabinoids levels which were higher than
10,000 ng / ml dropped to the low 100's after drinking 12 ounces
of water. After drinking a gallon of water, with or without one
of the &quot;cleansing agents&quot; added, it only took an hour
for the specific gravity to drop to less than 1.005.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">When one gallon of water was drunk, not only
did specific gravity fall to very low levels (creatinine&lt;20,
and specific gravity &lt;1.003), but the marijuana assay turned
negative and stayed that way, even after specific gravity levels
had returned to normal! The cocaine tests turned negative for a
few hours, but then turned positive again. The same results were
observed whether or not tea was used, however, when diuretics
were given, the test for both cannabinoids and cocaine turned
negative and stayed that way.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cone concluded that &quot;drug test outcome is
highly susceptible to water dilution; and the effects of dilution
are reflected concurrently in creatinine and specific gravity
measures.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">COMMENT: This observation will cause some
consternation in the drug testing community, and create more
problems than glutaraldehyde and Urinaid adulteration did. It is
not that difficult to develop detection strategies for chemicals
like glutaraldehyde. That may explain why the practice is already
starting to disappear, but setting standards for dilution will be
much more difficult. Eventually, it may be necessary to measure
drug / creatinine ratios to rule out dilution. Since tests may
remain negative even after the specific gravity returns toward
normal, it appears that low specific gravities cannot be relied
upn to reveal &quot;adulterated&quot; specimens. </font></p>

and the </p>

628-0871 * FAX (202) 628-1091 </p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to speak before
the Subcommittee today on these important issues. </p>

<p>The drug problem in our society is clearly one which is very
serious and which concerns all Americans. Although substance
abuse cuts across, all class and racial lines, the impact of the
drug problem has probably been greatest among low-income and
minority communities. In my testimony today, I would like to
focus in particular on the impact of the war on drugs as it
affects Black and Hispanic communities. </p>

<p><b>YOUNG BLACK MEN AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM</b> </p>

<p>In February of this year, my organization released a report on
race and the criminal justice system. The report, &quot;Young
Black Men and the Criminal Justice System: A Growing National
Problem,&quot; received extensive attention and shocked much of
the nation. The report documented that almost one out of four
Black men in the age group 20-29 is under the control of the
criminal justice system -- prison, jail, probation or parole.
This contrasts with one in sixteen white males and one in ten
Hispanic males. </p>

<p>These figures for Black males, shocking as they are, actually
understate the extent of the problem since our study only did a
one-day count of the criminal justice system. If we were able to
calculate the rates for an entire year, or ten-year period, the
number of Black males under criminal justice control would be
considerably higher than one in four. </p>

<p>There is also strong reason to believe that the figures for
Hispanics represent an undercount. There has been a great deal of
inconsistency in the way in which Hispanics are counted in
criminal justice populations, and for many categories, there
exist a large number of offenders for whom no data exist on
ethnicity. Because of this, it is reasonable to conclude that the
rate of criminal justice control for young Hispanic males is
higher than one in ten. Also, since Hispanics are counted in the
white criminal justice populations, the rate of criminal justice
control for non-Hispanic whites is therefore less than the one in
sixteen which we were able to document. </p>

<p>Our report further found that the number of young Black men in
the criminal justice system -- 609,690 -- far exceeded the number
of Black men of all ages enrolled in higher education -- 436,000.
These two figures taken together paint a very disturbing picture.
</p>

<p>As we noted in our report: </p>

<p>For the Black community in general, nearly one-fourth of its
young men are under the control of the criminal justice system at
a time when their peers are beginning families, learning
constructive life skills, and starting careers .... Unless the
criminal justice system can be used to assist more young Black
males in pursuing these objectives, any potential positive
contributions they can make to the community will be delayed, or
lost forever. </p>

<p>Our report estimated that the direct costs to the criminal
justice system for the control of the 609,000 Black men in their
twenties was $2.5 billion. Each offender who is incarcerated in a
state prison costs the taxpayers at least $16,000 a year.<u> l</u>/
Corrections costs have now reached the point where they are
having a serious impact on state funding for necessary social
services. In Michigan, for example, state spending for
corrections increased from 2.8 percent of the budget in 1984 to
7.2 percent in 1988.<u>2</u>/ The National Conference of State
Legislators reports that state spending on corrections increased
by an average of 14.2 percent last year, contributing to
&quot;serious budget problems&quot; that more than half the
states will face in 1990.<u>3/</u> </p>

<p><b>WHY ARE SO MANY YOUNG BLACK MALES UNDER THE CONTROL</b> </p>

<p><b>OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM?</b> </p>

<p>It is important to analyze the factors which have led us to
this distressing situation. The reasons behind this are complex.
Many are long-standing problems; others are a result of more
recent criminal justice policies. I would like to outline some of
the primary causes of this problem, and then to discuss the
impact which the war on drugs has had. </p>

<p>1. <u>&quot;Get Tough&quot; Sentencing Policies</u> </p>

<p>The U.S. Sentencing Commission and legislatures in almost all
fifty states have adopted a variety of increasingly harsh
sentencing laws in the past decade. In addition, parole release
policies have become more restrictive in many states. The
combined impact of these policies is that our prison and jail
populations have doubled in the past decade, to the point where
there are now more than one million Americans behind bars.
Prisons in 41 states are under court order regarding overcrowding
and conditions of confinement. Record numbers of offenders are
now also straining our probation and parole systems. </p>

<p>Mandatory minimum drug sentencing laws have played a
significant role in leading to these higher rates of criminal
justice control, particularly in regard to prison populations.
Two recent highly publicized cases illustrate this: </p>

<p>The <u>American Lawyer</u> reported on the case of Susana
Sanchez-Robles, a migrant worker and mother of five whose husband
had left her, leaving the family on welfare. Ms. Sanchez-Robles
drove a drug-laden van across the border from Mexico, and
received a mandatory ten-year prison term. Her five-year old
cries every evening. Says Ms. Sanchez-Robles: &quot;I try to feel
strong, but my strength is just totally defeated when I remember
my children.<u>4/</u> </p>

<p>Richard Winrow is a 22-year old Los Angeles man who was
abandoned by his father as a boy. He and his seven siblings grew
up poor, and Winrow ended up dropping out of high school and
working at low-wage jobs. A recent conviction for possession of 5
1/2 ounces of cocaine, a relatively small amount, was his third
drug offense. Under new federal drug laws, Winrow was sentenced
to life without the possibility of parole.<u>5/</u> </p>

<p>The dramatic increases in incarceration, parole and probation
rates resulting from our &quot;get tough&quot; policies have
affected all segments of society. The increase, however, has been
most significant for Blacks and other minorities, who were
already disproportionately represented in the system. </p>

<p>The rise in criminal justice populations has occurred without
any clear-cut relationship to the crime rate. FBI reports for the
past decade indicate that crime rates have had periods of both
decline and increase during these years, but that overall there
was only a 2 percent increase in crime rates between 1979-88.
Crime rates rose again in 1989, even though the nation recorded
the highest increase ever in its prison population. </p>

Drug War or a<b> </b>Hardened Criminal?&quot;<u> The Los Angeles
Times</u>, March 11, 1990. </p>

<p>2. <u>Criminal Justice Focus on Crimes of the Poor</u> </p>

<p>The criminal justice system has historically been focused much
more on &quot;crime in the streets&quot; than &quot;crime in the
suites.&quot; Although we have seen some change in recent years
in the prosecution of white collar offenses, crimes of the poor
have always received greater attention from the criminal justice
system. Since Blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately
represented among low-income people, this has contributed to
their over-representation in the criminal justice system. This
does not imply that crimes of the poor are necessarily either
more or less serious than crimes of the wealthy, but rather, that
we have a system that functions at least in part in a very
discretionary manner. </p>

<p>3. <u>Race and the Criminal Justice System</u> </p>

<p>There has been a good deal of debate about the extent to which
race influences criminal justice decision making. A recent study
by the RAND Corporation concludes that race was not a factor in
sentencing decisions in California.<u>6</u>/ It is important to
note, though, that California has a relatively rigid determinate
sentencing system, which allows for less variability in
sentencing outcomes than in many other states. </p>

<p>6 &quot;Race and Imprisonment Decisions in California,&quot;
Stephen Klein, Joan Petersilia, Susan Turner, <u>Science</u>,
February 16, 1990. </p>

<p>Our report found evidence that the criminal justice system may
be treating Black offenders differently than white offenders. The
number of young white males who are incarcerated, 247,000,
slightly exceeds the number of incarcerated Black males, 212,000.
The number of white males receiving probation, though, 697,000,
vastly exceeds the figure for Black males, 305,000. While the
nature of the offense or prior criminal history may explain these
figures, a close examination of this disparity should be
undertaken to determine to what extent racial bias is a factor. </p>

<p>As the authors of the RAND study point out, as well as many
others, race may play a more prominent role at the level of
arrest and prosecution, where greater discretion may be exercised
by police and prosecutors. This discretion may not always be
racially motivated, but it may have a racial impact. To the
extent that this is the case, a task for the courts is to attempt
to offset any disparity that may have occurred through
appropriate sentencing. </p>

<p>4. <u>Declining Social and Economic Support in Black
Communities</u> </p>

<p>The relationship between social and economic conditions and
individual crime rates is a complex one. Not all poor people or
unemployed people commit crimes, nor do all wealthy or employed
persons refrain from committing crimes. Personality traits,
family support, community constraints, and other factors all
influence individual behavior and the propensity to commit crime.
</p>

<p>Yet, as criminologist Elliott Currie has noted, &quot;The
evidence for a strong association, between inequality and crime
is overwhelming ... It isn't, accidental, then, that among
developed countries, the United States is afflicted
simultaneously with the worst rates of violent crime, the widest
spread of income inequality, and the most severe public policies
toward the disadvantaged.&quot;7/ </p>

<p>The stresses, strains, and lack of opportunity present in so
many minority communities increase the likelihood, that
individuals within that community will engage in criminal
activities, whether as a means of obtaining money, to support a
drug habit, for a challenge, or for other reasons. </p>

<p>Given these factors, we need to look at the deteriorating
social and economic support in the Black community. Essentially,
we find that on a broad range of variables, the situation of
Blacks in our society has declined over the past decade. The
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that total
appropriations for low income programs that are not entitlements
fell by 54 percent from FY 81 to FY 88, when adjusted for
inflation. This included support for job training, health and
social services, and housing programs. Also, although the number
of Americans living below the poverty line increased by 3.2
million during this period, spending for food stamps decreased by
15 percent when adjusted for inflation. Black households make up
36 percent of all households receiving food stamps. Overall,
these cuts affect Blacks and other minorities disproportionately,
since they are disproportionately poor.<u>8</u>/ </p>

<p>5. <u>Lack of Opportunity and Sense of Hopelessness</u> </p>

<p>An additional factor contributing to this situation is the
most difficult to quantify, yet in some ways the most
significant. In many communities today, young people growing up
have little hope for the future. It is one thing for a college
student to work at a fast food restaurant as a summer job. It is
entirely different for a young person to take on this kind of job
when there is little, expectation of rising above this entry
level. </p>

<p>The numbers in our report were not as shocking to most people
in the Black community. Instead they confirmed what many have
recognized for years: for Black males, the criminal justice
system has become almost an inevitable aspect of growing up. This
is not to say that it is a &quot;rite of passage,&quot; or an
event that is welcomed, but merely, that it is viewed as a part
of the life cycle which is almost unavoidable. This is a very sad
commentary on our society. </p>

Income, Employment, and Poverty</u>. Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, Washington, D.C., October 1988. </p>

<p><b>THE &quot;WAR ON DRUGS&quot; AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM</b> </p>

<p>A final factor contributing to increased involvement in the
criminal justice system, particularly, among Black Americans, is
the war on drugs, and the means by which this war is being waged.
This has been the result of two factors. </p>

<p>First, the drug problem has been defined basically as a law
enforcement problem, and not a social problem. In terms of our
political rhetoric, our<b> </b>funding priorities, and our policy
discussions, we have primarily chosen an approach which
emphasizes police and prisons over prevention and treatment. This
is not a new approach, or one which Mr. Bennett's office has
initiated unilaterally. Most states and localities have taken
this approach for many years, with unfortunately, little impact
on either drug use, availability or drug-related crime. </p>

<p>Second, although drug use and abuse occurs among all groups in
society, drug law enforcement is disproportionately weighted
toward inner city, low-income drug use, again primarily affecting
Blacks and Hispanics. A few statistics, illustrate this problem.
FBI data indicate that Blacks make-up an increasing percentage of
drug arrests, having increased from 30 to 38 percent of the total
between 1984 and 1988. According to the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, Blacks make up only 12 percent of those who use
illegal drugs.9/ </p>

<p>In Florida, Blacks now make up 73.3 percent of all prison
admissions for drug offenses, compared to 53.6 percent for all
other offenses.10/ </p>

<p>If the war on drugs continues in its present fashion, our
prisons will become increasingly filled with Black youth. The
plight of young Black men and the Black community which we
described in our report will only worsen. </p>

<p><b>POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</b> </p>

<p>I do not believe that, the large number of Black males within
the criminal justice system necessarily represents an intended
consequence of our crime control policies. Unfortunately,
however, as an <u>unintended</u> consequence of scores of
individual sentencing laws, use of discretion in the criminal
justice system, and funding priorities, we have created a true
crisis for the Black community, for the criminal justice system,
and for a nation that hopes to provide freedom and opportunity
for all citizens. A continuation of the war on drugs in the
manner in which it has been fought, no matter how well-intended,
will only exacerbate this situation. </p>

<p>If we wish to address this problem in a serious manner,
policymakers and criminal justice leaders need to respond in a
comprehensive manner. Elements of such a strategy include: </p>

<p>9 Sam Meddis, &quot;Drug arrest rate is higher for blacks; <u>USA
Today</u>, December 20, 1989. </p>

<p>10 Austin, James and Aaron David McVey, &quot;The Impact of
the War on Drugs,&quot; National Council on Crime and
Delinquency, San Francisco, 1989. </p>

<p>1. <u>Increase Diversion from the Criminal Justice System</u> </p>

<p>Many young and minor offenders are only stigmatized by their
contact with the criminal justice system, without necessarily
receiving either appropriate supervision or support.
Opportunities exist to divert many of these offenders to
organizations and individuals who can better focus on the
problems of Black, Hispanic, and poor youth. </p>

<p>*As a result of our report, for example, Black community
leaders in Memphis have formed a chapter of the 100 Black Men
Incorporated. The group's goal is to reduce the number of Black
men going into the criminal justice system. Its activities will
include establishing mentor programs, developing mechanisms for
keeping Black youth in school, and working with young offenders
in the juvenile justice system. </p>

<p>Policymakers can encourage development of programs such as
these, and court officials can divert more defendants into them,
thereby beginning to reduce the extent of criminal justice
control in many communities. </p>

<p>2. <u>Sentencing to Ameliorate Racial Disparities</u> </p>

<p>Judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and probation officers
all have a unique and important opportunity to lessen the drastic
impact which the justice system has had on Blacks and Hispanics.
That opportunity comes at the time of sentencing. The courtroom
sentencing process should include a full examination of the
circumstances of both victim and offender, and an analysis of
community support and supervision mechanisms which may be able to
contribute to appropriate sentencing options. The goals of this
process should be several: to assess public safety concerns; to
restore victims to the extent possible; to order appropriate and
constructive sanctions in the community; and, to reduce the
chances that offenders will return to the system. As an
organization familiar with sentencing programs and sentencing
reform efforts throughout the country, our staff knows that these
are attainable goals. </p>

<p>Court officials should also establish mechanisms to monitor
whether minority offenders are appropriately represented in
non-incarcerate sentencing alternatives, such as community
corrections programs, house arrest and electronic monitoring. If
disparities exist, an analysis of the reasons for this should be
undertaken. In the juvenile justice area, The National Council of
Juvenile and Family Court Judges is currently developing policy
recommendations to respond to the disproportionate incarceration
of minority youth. These may serve as a model which could be
adopted for the criminal justice system. </p>

<p>3. <u>Restore Appropriate Judicial Discretion</u> </p>

<p>White collar offenders such as Ivan Boesky and Oliver North
receive a full consideration of appropriate sentencing options.
For many of the indigent defendants filling up our nation's
prisons, mandatory and guideline sentencing virtually prohibit
any consideration of alternative sentencing options. Abuse of
judicial discretion needs to be carefully monitored, but use of
judicial discretion to respond to individual and community needs
at sentencing should be encouraged. </p>

<p>4. <u>Encourage Courts to Make Greater Use of Alternatives to
Incarceration</u> </p>

<p>Incarceration is by far the most costly component of the
criminal justice system. It has also not proved to be very
productive as a means of reducing crime. A variety of
community-based sanctions exist which have been demonstrated to
be appropriate punishments for a wide range of offenders. These
include restitution to victims, community service work, intensive
probation supervision, and provisions for treatment programs,
education, and employment. </p>

<p>My organization, The Sentencing Project, has helped develop
many programs that offer courts alternatives to prison in a range
of cases, and we have seen courts accept these alternatives in
well over half the cases presented. We know that judges can and
will make more use of alternatives, if given the opportunity to
do so at sentencing. </p>

<p>5. <u>Reduce Lengthy and Inefficient Prison Terms</u> </p>

<p>Mandatory sentencing laws and lengthier prison terms have
resulted in high costs, with only relatively modest gains in
crime control. Prisoners are prevented from committing crimes in
the community while they are locked up but this represents only a
small fraction of all crimes. A 1978 report by the National
Academy of Sciences concluded that to achieve a 10 percent
reduction in crime, New York would have had to increase its
prison population by 263 percent and Massachusetts by 310
percent.<u>11</u>/ </p>

<p>The massive increase in incarceration and lengthening of
prison terms provides almost no long-term benefits in reduction
of recidivism. The most recent Justice Department study of this
issue shows that recidivism rates, while very high, are virtually
identical for prisoners who serve anywhere from one to five
years.<u>12/</u> Therefore, &quot;getting tough&quot; results in
high corrections costs, but leaves us with offenders who are no
less likely to commit future crimes. </p>

<p>Reducing lengthy prison terms by itself is not the answer to
crime. What it would accomplish though, is to relieve the burden
on an overcrowded system to reduce the impact of the system on
minorities, and to free up tax dollars to be used for prevention,
a more effective means of crime control. </p>

Incapacitation: Estimating the Effects of Criminal Sanctions on
Crime Rates</u>, National Academy of Sciences, Washington, 1978. </p>

<p>12 Bureau of Justice Statistics, &quot;Recidivism of Prisoners
Released in 1983,&quot; Washington, D.C., April 1989. </p>

<p>6. <u>Require Racial/Ethnic Impact Statements from the Office
of National Drug Control Policy</u> </p>

<p>Given the serious impact of drugs and the drug war on minority
communities, I would suggest that the Office of National Drug
Control Policy be required to submit an annual report on the
impact of its policies and funding priorities on racial and
ethnic communities. Such a report might include the degree to
which funding is made available to minority communities and
organizations, the impact of prosecution and incarceration on
these communities, and the number of persons receiving drug
treatment services. This type of analysis would help to provide a
focus for policy considerations regarding minority communities. </p>

<p>7. <u>Develop More Accurate Reporting Methods for Hispanics</u>
</p>

<p>As noted above, there is reason to believe that Hispanics are
undercounted in the criminal justice system due to
inconsistencies in reporting methods and lack of data. It is
important to develop policies and procedures that are consistent
nationwide in order to assess the impact of criminal justice
policies on Hispanic communities, and to enable the criminal
justice system to respond more appropriately to its varied
populations. </p>

<p>8. <u>Restore a Balanced Perspective on the Relative Role of
Criminal Justice Sanctions and Social and Economic Supports</u> </p>

<p>The criminal justice system does not necessarily provide the
best forum for reducing crime. As the American Bar Association
Criminal Justice Section's Special Committee on Criminal Justice
in a Free Society reported, of approximately 34 million serious
crimes committed against persons or property in 1986, 31 million
never resulted in arrest and only several hundred thousand
resulted in felony convictions and imprisonment. Simply put, law
enforcement and court officials could, under the best of
conditions, effectively prosecute and punish only a small portion
of overall criminal activity.13/ </p>

<p>Our continued excessive emphasis on a law enforcement strategy
to fight drugs fails to address the root causes of the drug
problem. Our emphasis on punitive criminal justice remedies
distracts us from more fundamental and potentially far-reaching
questions: why is it that citizens of one of the wealthiest
nations and of all social classes use illegal substances to the
extent that Americans do today? </p>

<p>For inner city and low-income communities, these root causes
are certainly more closely tied to poverty, lack of opportunity,
poor education and health care, and lack of hope for the future,
than to any lack of jail and prison cells. </p>

<p>At the same time we have been waging a law enforcement war,
with its own negative effects upon young Black males, conditions
for Black communities have worsened on other fronts as well. A
new study by the National Center for Children in Poverty of
Columbia University documents that half of Black children and 40
percent of Hispanic children under the age of six now live in
poverty.<u>14</u>/ It should be clear to those of us within the
criminal justice system as well as others, that unless we
effectively address issues of poverty immediately, we are likely
to see the next generation of Black males enter the criminal
justice system at a rate even higher than one in four. </p>

<p>We have a choice. We can spend money on prisons, and on
policies that are guaranteed to fill them with people who don't
need to be in them, including many young Black men, <u>or</u> we
can spend more time, energy, creativity and money to keep more
people out of the system entirely. Funding for poverty-fighting,
crime-preventing programs should be viewed from the long-term
perspective, as a preventive measure which will reduce criminal
justice costs in the future. </p>

(Chicago 1988) pp. 4,5. </p>

<p>14 Spencer Rich, &quot;Report Says Children Under 6 Have
Highest Poverty Rate,&quot;<u> The Washington Post</u>, April<b> </b>15,
1990. </p>

<p><b>CONCLUSION</b> </p>

<p>Of the scores of editorials which appeared in response to our
report (see Appendix) almost all uniformly endorsed the range of
policy recommendations I have suggested here. This reaction shows
that the public may be much more ready for change than many
policymakers have led us to believe. </p>

<p>The funding and policy decisions we make today regarding our
approach to the drug problem will have a direct impact on the
next generation of Black men. As an editorial in the <u>Charleston
(S.C.) Post/Courier</u> noted, &quot;If the festering cycle of
poverty, violence and hate is not broken, more black men will be
doomed to lives of crime and years behind bars.&quot; </p>

BARS </h3>

<h5><i>The numbers point to a need for preventive programs </i></h5>

<p>DETROIT FREE PRESS/THURSDAY, MARCH 1, 1990 </p>

<p>It is a haunting snapshot: </p>

<ul>
    <li>One million persons in U.S. jails and prisons, a number
        matched only by the Soviet Union. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Almost one in four black men between 20 and 29 in prison
        or jail, on probation or parole on a single day in, 1989.
        (Over the course of the year, the number of individuals
        under the criminal justice system's control would be a
        good bit higher.) Comparable figures for white men are
        one in 16 and for Hispanic males one in 10. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The number of young black men under the control of the
        criminal justice system - 609,690 - exceeds the total
        number of black men enrolled in college in 1986 -
        436,000. For white males, the figures are 4.6 million in
        higher education and just more than one million in the
        criminal justice system. </li>
</ul>

<p>Those and other facts are contained in a new report by the
Sentencing Project, which argues persuasively that it's time for
a look at hard goals and means in the criminal justice system.
Even if the cost of incarcerating or otherwise controlling young
black males weren't an astronomical 2.5 billion, even if prison
overcrowding weren't a national scandal, even if the prison
buildup in Michigan and elsewhere weren't diverting attention
from other problems that would be true. The need for a
reassessment is made more compelling by the nationwide phenomenon
that more and longer sentences have come at a time of declining
crime rates. </p>

<p>The importance that the report by the Washington-based,
nonprofit organization places on the racial and ethnic
disparities that exist is appropriate. In assessing the impact of
the present system on the black community, though, it seems to
ignore that the vast majority of the victims of these youthful
black offenders were black as well. The current, &quot;get
tough&quot; stance of the system is popular among blacks, who
long saw crime in their communities ignored. </p>

<p>The report, however, reasonably suggests a look at
alternatives to incarceration, as well as more treatment programs
and greater use of victim restitution programs. </p>

<p>For some time - including 1986 when our year-long emphasis was
a &quot;generation worth saving&quot; - we've written about the
need for a long term strategy for intervening early to help
salvage the lives of young people. </p>

<p>Ten or 20 years from now, we'll be decrying similar - or worse
- findings if prevention, rather than reaction, doesn't emerge as
our top priority. </p>

<h3><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22">BLACKS
IN PRISON </h3>

<p>THE BIRMINGHAM NEWS, BIRMINGHAM, ALA., D. 169,060, AL-144, FEB
28, 1990 </p>

<p>It would be easy to jump to conclusions about a new study that
indicates one in four black men between the ages of 20 and 29 is
either in prison or jail on probation or parole. See, some will
say, I told you blacks were more likely to be criminals. </p>

<p>That's not what the study says. What it does say is that young
black men make up a much higher percentage of the prison
population than they should. </p>

<p>Lack of education, lack of job opportunities, a welfare system
that has weakened families without curing poverty and a drug
culture that has taken root in poor neighborhoods all have more
to do with why people become criminals than skin color. </p>

<p>The statistics in <u>The Sentencing Project</u> report raise a
number of questions. For example, in 1989 there were 247,930
whites in state prisons, jails and federal prisons, compared to
212,252 blacks. </p>

<p>With blacks comprising only about 12 percent of the entire
U.S. population, those numbers should not be so close to equal.
But they are. Why then, given a nearly equal number of blacks and
whites in prison, are there more than twice as many whites on
probation or parole (806,578) than blacks (397,438)? </p>

<p>Crime rates nationally rose only 2 percent between 1979 and
1988, yet the number of prison inmates doubled during that time.
In other words, there hasn't been more crime, but there has been
a tougher attitude toward criminals. More of them are being sent
to jail and more of those being sent are black. </p>

<p>As a result, 23 percent of all young black men (609,690) are
to some degree<b> </b>under the control of the criminal justice
system, compared to 6 percent of young white men (1,054,508).
More young black men are getting their higher education in the
criminal justice system than in college (436,000). </p>

<p>The Sentencing Project said the cost of incarcerating or
monitoring convicted young black men has reached $2.5 billion a
year. Then it pointed out that although the prison population has
tripled since 1973, victimization rates have only dropped 5
percent. </p>

<p>The Project suggests more alternative sentencing - victims
restitution, community service, etc. - as a cost-effective way to
keep young blacks out of prison. We agree. But those actions only
address the problem after it has become a problem, which is the
shortcoming of the U.S. criminal justice system. </p>

<p>This nation needs a more effective system that interacts with
public education and social services to reach young people, black
and white, before they become criminals. </p>

<p>Locking them up is a belated and costly answer. </p>

<h3><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22">A
LOST GENERATION </h3>

<p>The San Diego Union, San Diego, Calif., D. 252,686, March 1,
1990, BURRELLE'S </p>

<p>It is a national tragedy that one of every four black American
men in their 20's has been convicted of a crime. This disturbing
statistic has complex roots in a drug-ridden society where
incentives to work for a better life have been steadily
undermined. </p>

<p>According to a study released by the Sentencing Project, a
Washington-based nonprofit group, 25 percent of black men in
their 20s are in jail, in prison or on probation or parole. This
number refers only to those actually convicted of does not
include suspects who are arrested and released. By contrast only
about 6 percent of white men in their 20s are being held or
supervised by criminal courts. </p>

<p>Marc Mauer, author of the re port, rightly points out that
America now faces the frightening prospect of &quot;writing off
an entire generation of black men, from leading productive
lives.'' </p>

<p>The implications of the report are ominous. From almost every
standpoint - education, health, income, mortality and family
unity - black men are one of the nation's most troubled groups.
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan , who is
known for alarmist statements, puts it aptly: &quot; Not since
slavery has so much calamity and ongoing catastrophe been visited
on black males.&quot; </p>

<p>The causes of the crisis are many and varied. Drug abuse
obviously is a prime factor. Poverty and lack of employment add
to the problem. Well-intentioned welfare programs have eroded
traditional values and helped create a permanent underclass.
Despite the best efforts of legislators, discrimination still
exists. Most of these causes are exacerbated by inadequate
education, poor self-esteem and resultant feelings of despair. </p>

<p>Herb Cawthorne, chairman of San Diego's Black Federation,
agrees that better education and more job opportunities would
reduce the crime rate among young black men. But he also
perceives the need to address what he calls &quot; this serious,
systemic problem&quot; in a practical way by urging blacks to
stand up and help themselves. </p>

<p>&quot;They must not think their situation is hopeless,&quot;
he says. &quot;When that happens, anger and resentment build up
toward society and irresponsible behavior results.&quot; </p>

<p>The Sentencing Project report makes no attempt to explain why
so many black men run afoul of the law but contends that it is
counterproductive merely to lock them up. Mr. Mauer recommends
alternatives such as forcing criminals to repay their victims or
work on community projects. </p>

<p>The report's main contribution is to spur national debate on a
subject that has become too critical to neglect. We as a nation
must recognize that far too many young black men are in deep
trouble. A battle must be waged to break the festering cycle of

<h3><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22">GENERATION
OF BLACK MALES NOW AT RISK </h3>

<p>Rockford Register Star, Rockford, Il, Saturday March 3, 1990 </p>

<p>There are truly shocking implications in a new study report
showing that nearly one in every four American black males in
their 20s is behind bars or on probation or parole. This terrible
statistic suggests, as one of the authors of the study puts it,
that the nation now risks &quot; the possibility of writing off
an entire generation of black men from leading productive
lives.&quot; </p>

<p>The causes of this frightening situation are of both recent
and long-standing issue. Obviously, the familiar factor of
grinding poverty in the black underclass is involved. Widespread
disintegration of black families, for a number of reasons, is
another cause. The growth of the crack-cocaine culture in urban
ghettos is yet another. </p>

<p>On top of all that, there has been in recent years the spread
of get-tough policies in dealing with street crime - more
prisons, longer sentences, more mandatory sentences. If the
product of this popular strategy is the loss of a whole
generation of black men, it would seem to merit rethinking. </p>

<p>That's also the attitude of The Sentencing Project, the
nonprofit organization that sponsored the study report. It calls
for reforms in the criminal justice system calculated to make
first-time lawbreakers less likely to become repeat offenders. </p>

<p>The point is well made. For 20 years, the popular approach to
crime has been to hire more police, build more prisons, appoint
tougher judges, hand down sterner sentences - and for all of that
we find that crime rates have only increased. Alternatives along
the lines suggested by the Sentencing Project merit exploration. </p>

<p>These would include alternative punishments (restitution to
victims, community service) and programs of drug treatment,
employment training and education for first-time offenders.
Prison should be last resort after alternatives have failed, as
the study report recommends. </p>

<p>In recent decades, this nation has spent hundreds of billions,
even trillions, of dollars to defend itself against the menace of
international communism. With that threat now on the wane,
perhaps it is time that we devote more of our resources to saving
the country from the awful consequences that are sure to accrue
from the moral and economic incapacitation of an entire
generation of black men by lives of crime. </p>

<h3><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22">A
GENERATION IS UNDER ARREST </h3>

<p>DURHAM MORNING HERALD, DURHAM, NC, DAILY 46,324, TUESDAY MAR
6, 1990, BURRELLE'S </p>

<p>One black man behind bars, on probation or on parole is an
individual; two-thirds of a million is a statistic. That's how
we've looked at the growing plight of young black males, as
statistics rather than individuals. </p>

<p>A study released a few days ago by the Sentencing Project, a
non-profit organization that promotes alternative punishments and
sentencing reform, helps put the problems of black males in
stunning perspective. </p>

<p>Analyzing figures obtained from the U.S. Justice Department,
researchers concluded that one in four black males between the
ages of 20 and 29 is in trouble with the law. He is either in
jail, on probation or on parole. </p>

<p>If these figures are accurate - the Justice Department didn't
dispute them - they reveal the outline of a social disaster whose
repercussions will be with us for a long time. Consider: </p>

<ul>
    <li>609,690 young blacks were under control of the criminal
        justice system in mid 1989. That's 23 percent of the
        entire black male population aged 20-29. </li>
    <li>Although 1,054,058 white men in the same age category
        were under control of the criminal justice system, they
        represented only 6.2 percent of the 20-29 age group. </li>
    <li>The number of black men in college was roughly 436,000. </li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, more young black men face officers of the law
than face professors of English. It's hard not to agree with Marc
Mauer, author of The Sentencing Project study, when he says,
&quot;We now risk the possibility of writing off an entire
generation of black men from leading productive lives.&quot; </p>

<p>Indeed, that already may be happening. Young black men are 10
times more likely to be murdered than their white counterparts.
Murder is the primary cause of death among black males aged 15 to
44 - a death rate so high it has become the major factor in the
falling life expectancy of American blacks as a whole. </p>

<p>Mr. Mauer argues against building more prison cells, the
approach generally favored in North Carolina, and putting more
stress on counseling, dispute resolution and other alternatives
to prison. He would also give judges broad sentencing guidelines
that would allow them to tailor a criminal's punishment to his
situation. </p>

<p>Mr. Mauer's recommendations address only the surface tension
of a much deeper pool of problems. The driving forces behind the
failure of so many young black men to thrive in today's society
can be traced to an environment of crime, drugs and family
disintegration. </p>

<p>There is no simple answer to what is happening to them, but
one place to start looking for it is in jobs. The federal
government's Job Corps program now takes about 65,000 youngsters
a year, a figure that could be doubled by Congress at the cost of
two B-2 bombers. Congress should also consider some form of
voluntary national service, perhaps along the lines of the
Depression-era Civilian Corps, to teach job skills and foster a
sense of self- achievement. </p>

<p>Business can help through innovative hiring practices and by
supporting school reform. Professionals and other well-educated
people can give a few hours a month to tutoring programs. Only
when the young black male emerges as a whole person rather than a
statistic in such endeavors will we see not only the measure of
his problems, but also the opportunities to help him. </p>

<h3><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22">WASTING
A GENERATION OF YOUNG BLACKS IN PRISONS </h3>

<p>CALIFORNIAN, EL CAJON, CA, DAILY 22,337, SATURDAY MAR 3, 1990 </p>

<p>More depressing news is difficult to imagine: One in every
four black men in their 20s is in jail, in prison, on probation
or parole. At a time when they should be graduating from colleges
and universities, settling into good jobs, getting married and
raising families, many of them sit in fetid prison cells, doing
nothing constructive for themselves or for society. </p>

<p>Martin Luther King chanted the refrain &quot;Free at
last,&quot; but loosing the shackles of bondage caused by
discriminatory practices unfortunately did not improve by much
the status of what has been called the vast
&quot;underclass&quot; of blacks with no jobs, little education,
and no future. </p>

<p>&quot;We now risk the possibility of writing off an entire
generation of black men from leading productive lives,&quot; said
Marc Mauer, author of a report by <u>The Sentencing Project</u>,
a Washington based group lobbying for alternatives to
incarceration. &quot;This has ominous implications for the black
community. We really don't know what it will mean for the future
because we have never had a situation like this before.&quot; </p>

<p>A quarter of a century, more or less, has passed since the
civil rights marches of the 1960s, the burning of Watts and the
rage of probably a dozen cities in this country. How far have we
come? Not far at all. </p>

<p>Although blacks make up only about 12 percent of the nation's
population, there are more black inmates in state prisons than
whites. Among the young males, 23 percent of the blacks end up in
prison or on probation or parole; 6 percent of the whites in the
same age category are in that predicament. </p>

<p>At the beginning of the conservative era with the inauguration
of Ronald Reagan, there was much talk of establishing
&quot;enterprise zones&quot; in the ghettos of large cities. This
was to be the Republican answer to &quot;throwing money at
problems.&quot; </p>

<p>If there are any models of &quot;enterprise zones&quot; that
have brought economic vitality to the most depressed areas of
large cities, they must be the best-kept secrets of the
Reagan-Bush and Bush-Quayle administrations. With unemployment at
high levels, black youths turn to drug trade for their
livelihood. </p>

<p>A completely separate report prepared for the University of
California reveals that the number of blacks entering the UC
system is low - only 4.5 percent of black high school graduates
in California are eligible compared to 14.1 percent of the white
graduates. </p>

<p>One more door is closed that, if opened, would change the
picture for the future of young blacks. </p>

<p>It should come as no surprise that the cost of incarcerating
the large numbers of blacks in prison, and supervising them while
they are on probation or parole, is staggering. It's put at $2.5
billion. </p>

<p>What a colossal waste when so much could be done with that
money to teach young blacks the skills necessary for good-paying
jobs or improve their educational levels so they could go on to
college and be rewarded with positions that offer prestige and
compensation equal to what their white counterparts receive. </p>

<p>We are preparing for a blighted future when so many young
blacks view entry into the drug trade as their only way out of
poverty and squalor. It will require a national administration
with a more realistic grasp of what is needed to reverse this
ominous trend than the platitudes and empty symbolism offered by
the Bushes and the Qualyes. (dch) <br>

<p>Re: Criminal Justice System reforms </p>

<p>Gentlemen: </p>

<p>From time to time you have published articles concerning the
Criminal Justice System of New York State, and have commented on
various proposals to reform the system. In this regard, the
Correctional Association of New York is probably the most
knowledgeable state-wide group which studies the problems and
recommends legislation to amend various sections of the New York
State Penal Law and Criminal Procedure Law. </p>

<p>Over the past several years, I have studied and suggested
various reforms, which, if enacted, would reduce the number of
inmates serving indeterminate sentences of imprisonment in the
State prison system. </p>

<p>The second felony offender law (Penal Law70.06) mandates
prison sentences of defendants convicted of any felony (whether
violent or not) during the ten years period following the first
felony offense (again whether violent or not). Because of this
law, there are thousands of prisoners serving time in
correctional facilities for low grade non-violent felony
convictions, and who must serve one-half of their maximum
sentences before parole consideration (as compared to first
felony offenders which must serve only one-third of their maximum
sentences). Judges have no discretion in sentencing second felony
offenders. </p>

<p>The Correctional Association, Governor Cuomo, and many others,
have annually urged the Legislature to repeal the second felony
offender law and authorize judges to impose prison sentences, or
alternative non-prison sentences, depending on mitigating or
aggravating factors in each case. I believe this has never come
about because the legislators fear being perceived as &quot;soft
on crime.&quot; </p>

<p>Other reforms are badly needed. Under the Rockefeller drug
laws (Penal Law Article 220-Controlled Substance Offenses),
offenders must be sentenced to prison regardless of whether the
offender is a &quot;street seller&quot; (probably an addict
selling to support his own addiction), or a higher level seller.
Most offenders convicted of these crimes receive no treatment for
their addiction. The Penal Law should be amended to authorize
judges to impose alternate sentences coupled with drug treatment
in the community. Here again, legislators fear being labeled
&quot;soft on crime&quot;. </p>

<p>The third area where reform is badly needed is the granting of
good behavior time to imprisoned convicts to reduce their
sentences. When the new Penal Law was enacted in the mid-sixties,
it provided that an inmates' good behavior time could only be
applied to one-third of the maximum sentence (Penal Law 70.30
(4) Corrections Law 703-b) . The former Penal Law-applied the
good time to the minimum sentence. Under that earlier law,
Inmates had an incentive to reduce their minimum sentence by
complying with all the rules and regulations governing good
behavior. There is no longer such incentive available to today's
convict. </p>

<p>The Correctional Association has championed the repeal of the
mandatory second felony offender law, and giving discretion to
judges to impose an alternate sentence. The Association also
recommends legislation to apply good behavior time to the minimum
sentence. In this regard, I am enclosing a copy of the
Correctional Association Newsletter published this past March,
which sets forth the position of the Association and its reasons.
I am also enclosing a copy of a pessimistic Correctional
Association letter to me dated June 8, 1993. </p>

<p>These reforms have been included in the Governor's criminal
justice proposals for several years. I am enclosing a copy of a
letter to me dated June 17, 1993, from Counsel to the New York
State Director of Criminal Justice, with a frank conclusion that
the Governor's proposals are not likely to be enacted. </p>

<p>In addition to the Correctional Association position, the New
York State Commissioner of Correctional Services, Thomas A.
Coughlin III, has spoken out strongly in favor of the proposed
reforms. I am enclosing a copy of his testimony given at a
meeting of the Assembly Codes Committee on June 8, 1993. He
comments as to several reforms in the system, and the reasons why
the law should be modified or changed, including the harsh
Rockefeller drug laws, and the rigidity of the second felony
offender law. Mr. Coughlin's views are shared by Governor Cuomo,
but no action has been taken by the Legislature because of the
fear of being labeled &quot;soft on crime.&quot; I believe that
if the members of the Legislature would consider these reforms on
the merits, and explain the reasons to their constituents, this
would eliminate the &quot;soft on crime&quot; aspect of the
reforms. </p>

<p>On March 23, 1993, you published an extensive article written
by Francis X. Clines, beginning on page B-1, concerning the
harshness of the drug laws, and told the story of inmate Lawrence
V. Cipollone, who is serving a lengthy drug sentence and is
seeking executive clemency from the Governor later this year. I,
and many others, are actively supporting Mr. Cipollone's request.
On July 27, 1993, you published an article concerning the
Governor's December 29, 113,12, grant of executive clemency to
Lawrence Snider, an inmate serving time for drug offenses. The
article was written by Peter Marks, and started on page A-1. It
reviews the harshness of the Rockefeller drug laws as they punish
a low-level street drug seller. </p>

<p>While on the subject of executive clemency, there is a
remarkable story concerning Mr. Thomas E. Ventura of 278 North
Country Road, Miller Place, Long Island, which might be of
interest to you in subsequent articles on this subject. In the
fall of 1974, Mr. Ventura, age 23 at that time, was charged in
Suffolk County with sale and possession of more than one ounce of
marijuana on November 4, 1974. He was also charged with sale and
possession of more than one ounce of cocaine on December 4, 1974.
He was convicted as charged, after a jury trial on October
5,1978. On November 2, 1978, he was sentenced to life
imprisonment, with a minimum of fifteen years. His conviction was
affirmed by the Appellate Division on November 10, 1980, and
Leave to Appeal to the Court of Appeals was denied on December
15, 1980. </p>

<p>While in prison, Mr. Ventura began an extensive educational
effort. </p>

<p>It included: (1) 1980-Osborn School, Auburn Correctional
Facility-Mechanical Drafting. (2) 1983-Ulster County Community
College- an Associate Degree in Liberal Arts, maintaining a grade
point average of 4.0. (3) 1985-State University of New York at
New Paltz, a Bachelor of Arts Degree, majoring in psychology and
sociology. His grade point average was 3.96, and he graduated <u>summa
cum laude</u>, and was Valedictorian of his class. Mr. Ventura
applied for Executive Clemency in 1986, after serving seven and
one-half years, (one-half of his minimum sentence). I had
extensive correspondence with Mr. Ventura in the fall of 1986
concerning his application. After reviewing the situation on
November 13, 1986, I recommended that Governor Cuomo grant
clemency to Mr. Ventura. There were compelling reasons for the
Governor's action. Mr. Ventura's application was also supported
by the then District Attorney of Suffolk County, Patrick Henry,
and many other persons within the correctional system, who were
familiar with Mr. Ventura's accomplishments while in prison. </p>

<p>On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1986, Governor Cuomo granted
clemency, and Mr. Ventura was conditionally released on parole
several days later. After his release, Mr. Ventura began the
study of law at Touro Law School in Huntington. He received his
Juris Doctor Degree on May 30, 1993. Mr. Ventura received the
American Jurisprudence Award For Excellence. He also served as
Editor-in-Chief of the Law Journal. While attending law school,
Mr. Ventura served as: (1) student library assistant; (2) an
intern with the Touro Criminal Law Clinic; and (3) law intern
judicial clerk with Hon. Alfred E. Lama of the New York State
Supreme Court. He is presently serving as a law intern in the
office of Scott Zamek, Esq., of Melville. </p>

<p>I believe that Mr. Ventura's outstanding rehabilitation while
in prison and his activities after release could be the subject
of a <u>New York Times</u> article at an appropriate time. His
story demonstrates the harshness of the Rockefeller drug laws.
After being found guilty of sale and possession of a small amount
of narcotic drugs, Mr. Ventura's life sentence was mandated. </p>

<p>In an interesting recent development, a Long Termers (those
serving sentences of more than ten years) Committee at Woodbourne
Prison has begun publication of a Newsletter containing their
hopes for criminal justice reforms, including the proposal to
change the application of good behavior time to the minimum
sentence. These Newsletters are excellently written, and the
Committee is attempting to promulgate the Newsletter to a wide
spectrum of individuals and organizations concerned with reforms
of the Criminal Justice System. I am enclosing copies of the
March, April-May, June and July Newsletters, and a copy of the
inmates' letter to me. The work of this Committee should be
publicized as much as possible, especially to legislators and
appropriate state officials. </p>

<p>One might ask why I am so concerned with Criminal Justice
System reform. I have acquired knowledge and experience during my
many years service in the State judiciary. I have been a trial
judge in the County Court of Suffolk County and subsequently in
the Criminal Term of the New York State Supreme Court for over
thirty years. I have presided over hundreds of criminal trials,
pre-trial and post-trial hearings, sentencing proceedings and
miscellaneous criminal court matters. Since 1985, In addition to
my other duties, I serve as an Associate Justice of the Appellate
Term of the Supreme Court in the Ninth and Tenth Judicial
Districts. Over one-half of the appeals are from convictions in
the local criminal courts (District Courts of Nassau and Suffolk,
City Courts in the Ninth Judicial District, and Town and Village
Courts in both judicial districts). </p>

<p>When I first came on the bench, I had wide discretion to
impose sentences, both of imprisonment, and alternate sentences
within the community, mainly sentences of probation. Over the
ensuing years, the Penal Law has been amended so as to mandate
sentences of imprisonment for a large number of crimes. No longer
have judges authority to choose an appropriate sentence based
upon the facts of the crime, the criminals background and other
factors. In recent years, judges have become &quot;rubber
stamps&quot;, imposing bargained-for sentences between the
District Attorney and the offender. A judge generally takes no
part in the sentence bargaining, which is first presented to him
at the guilty plea proceeding. The only right reserved by the
judge is to permit a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea if the
judge has decided, after reviewing the written presentence
investigation, to impose a stiffer sentence than the one
bargained-for. A defendant in this situation may either accept
the judge's intended sentence, or withdraw his guilty plea, and
either be tried or to attempt to negotiate another sentence. </p>

<p>There is little chance of the present Legislature amending the
Penal Law to give judges discretion in determining appropriate
sentences. Here again, the legislators perception of the voters
being against them as being &quot;soft on crime&quot;, prevents
serious legislative consideration of these needed reforms in the
Criminal Justice System. </p>

<p>In this letter, I have attempted to set forth what many of us
believe should be done to reform the New York State's Criminal
Justice System. In an effort to obtain greater coverage of this
subject, I have written several times to the Long Island
newspaper <u>Newsday</u>, and I am enclosing copies of my letters
of March 25, 1993, and April 12, 1993, and a copy of my April 12,
1993 letter to the New York State Director of Criminal Justice. </p>

<p>My present effort is to obtain wide promulgation of these
important issues. I am confident that<u> The New York Times</u>,
as the quintessential leader of newspapers published in New York
State, will, at an appropriate time, add its voice to these
efforts. </p>

<p>I believe that this inaction is predicated on their belief
that supporting these reforms would lead to a perception by the

unfortunate. I am attempting to promulgate my views and those of

<h2 align="center">AMERICA HELD PRISONER </h2>

<p align="center"><b>by Hugh Downs</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>Recorded: April 14, 1994</b> </p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>I received a letter from Mr. Clifford A. Schaffer recently.
Clifford Schaffer is the co-author of the Resolution for a
Federal Commission on Drug Policy, the now famous Hoover
Resolution that seeks to end the violence caused by the infamous
war on drugs. </p>

<p>I long ago realized that a shooting war waged against a
medical condition is inappropriate. I have never really
understood why it is that so many individuals in the government
could have chosen such an ill-advised and disastrous course, and
perhaps I never will understand. But Mr. Schaffer tells me that
the situation is worse than I had imagined. </p>

<p>I should say at the outset that I learned that Clifford
Schaffer is the man who coined that most quotable of quotes,
&quot;More Colombians die from American tobacco than the number
of Americans who die from Colombian cocaine.&quot; I have found
this particular fact a sobering notion to ponder and have
repeated it, even on this program. Now that I know the source, he
should get credit. His letter contained many such startling facts
about the bloody and unjust &quot;war against drugs&quot; --
facts that made me stop and wonder why we continue to fight it.
Mr. Schaffer tells me that in six short years, in the year 2000,
the United States of America will have a prison population bigger
than all the Nazi concentration camps put together. </p>

<p>Let's put this projection into perspective. Mr. Schaffer says,
&quot;Right now we have about 1.3 million people in prison. More
than 600,000 of them are there for non-violent drug offenses. For
every person who died from illegal drugs last year, 150 people
went to prison. Most of them were black men.&quot; </p>

<p>The expense of maintaining a prison population is staggering.
If nearly half of them don't belong there, then something is
terribly wrong. </p>

<p>As the drug war escalates, more prisoners will be taken and
more dead and wounded will litter our streets. Remember, by the
year 2000 we will have more prisoners than all the Nazi
concentration camps combined. Mr. Schaffer's prediction seems
almost incredible, but one look down the street will convince
almost anybody that America is a dangerous place. Many foreign
governments routinely issue warnings to their traveling citizens
that America is a dangerous place. We are, after all, at war. </p>

<p>Drug warriors justify their war against the American people by
claiming that certain illegal drugs are killing our children,
killing adults, and generally ruining our society. But look at
the figures on drugs and death. In a typical year, the
approximate number of people who die from taking cocaine hovers
around 2,500 people. Heroin deaths are less than that, at about
2,000. To give some perspective to these numbers, it's useful to
bear in mind that 2,000 people die every year from taking
aspirin, too. Aspirin can cause catastrophic intestinal bleeding
and death. And can be easily used to that effect, legally, by
suicides. </p>

<p>Tobacco which, so far, is still a legal drug, kills around
400,000 people every year. The government supports tobacco
production, and helps to sell American tobacco products around
the world. Another 50,000 people die from sidestream tobacco
smoke. These deaths occur in people who don't smoke at all; they
just happen to inhale other people's smoke. Ironically, tobacco
is considered such an acceptable drug that, according to Peter
McWilliams, four major tobacco companies (in other words, drug
dealers) became &quot;partners&quot; in the anti-drug group
Partnership for a Drug-Free America. </p>

<p>Every year, approximately 10,000 people die from prescription
drugs. Some of these deaths are due to miscalculated
self-medication; others are due to interaction with existing
medical conditions (or with other drugs) that were unforeseen or
ignored by the prescribing physician; and I'd guess that some of
these deaths were intentional suicides too. </p>

<p>The total number of deaths due to all the illegal drugs
combined is about 4,500 people. Now compare 4,500 deaths with the
number of deaths due to prescription drugs, alcohol (which is
about 80,000 people), tobacco, over-the-counter aspirin, and
sidestream smoke. The total number of deaths due to these legal
drugs is well over 500,000 people -- every year. The
multi-billion dollar drug war ignores the half-a-million deaths
due to legal drugs and instead makes the illogical claim that
4,500 deaths due to illegal drugs justifies a multi-billion
dollar shooting war. </p>

<p>So far, I have not mentioned marijuana. Marijuana is illegal
and tens of thousands of non-violent people are in prison because
of it. There are no deaths attributed to marijuana use. Nobody
dies. In fact, Mr. Schaffer tells us that &quot;Even the DEA
itself says that there has not been a recorded death due to
marijuana in the history of the United States.&quot; </p>

<p>Apparently, millions of Americans continue to smoke marijuana
regardless of the law and regardless of the war waged against
them. Neither prohibitive law nor official brutality seems to
have it's intended effect. </p>

<p>There is something else about marijuana which grabs our
attention. Marijuana is also a pharmaceutical drug that has
established therapeutic use in a variety of medical conditions.
But, since it is caught up in the hysteria of the drug war,
doctors are prohibited from conducting research on marijuana and
patients are deprived of its benefits. </p>

<p>A recently published book called Marihuana, the Forbidden
Medicine tells all. The authors of this book are Lester Grinspoon
and James Bakalar. Dr. Grinspoon is a medical doctor and an
associate professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School.
Mr. Bakalar is an associate editor of the Harvard Mental Health
Letter and a lecturer in law in the Department of Psychiatry at
Harvard. </p>

<p>The authors record a surprising number of therapeutic uses for
marijuana -- the list considers more than twenty years of
research. Marijuana counteracts the violent effects of
chemotherapy used in cancer treatment --- and to those who say
that marijuana must be bad because it is smoked and smoking is
bad, Dr. Grinspoon points out that the more powerful strains of
marijuana found today actually require less smoking to obtain
therapeutic levels. Patients consistently report that synthetic
versions do not work. </p>

<p>The pressure on the eyes resulting from glaucoma is relieved
with marihuana use. The amelioration of other conditions, too,
are on record; and conditions that include epilepsy, multiple
sclerosis, paraplegia and quadriplegia; AIDS; chronic pain;
migraine; pruritis; menstrual cramps and labor pain; and even
depression and other mood disorders. </p>

<p>It makes you stop and think. Here is a weed, growing wild that
millions use whether there is a law against it or not. It kills
no one. It has been in continuous use for about 5,000 years that
we know of, and it has recognized medical applications. And yet
the government is waging a deadly and expensive war against it. </p>

<p>This mystery deepens considerably when we learn that the
government sits on an impressive pile of studies that recommend
the decriminalization of, not only marijuana, but of several
other drugs as well. </p>

<p>In 1944, there was the LaGuardia Committee Report; in 1967
there was the Baroness Wootton Report published by the government
of Great Britain. In 1969, the Canadian government published the
Report of the Canadian Government Commission of Inquiry into the
Non-Medical Use of Drugs. In 1972, there was Dealing with Drug
Abuse: A Report to the Ford Foundation. Also in 1972 the
Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs came out. </p>

<p>In 1973, the US Federal Government itself published the Report
of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse. In 1980,
the United States Drug Abuse Council published The Facts About
Drug Abuse. In 9182 there was An Analysis of Marijuana Policy and
most recently, the state of California's study titled, The Report
of the California State Research Advisory Panel. </p>

<p>All of these official studies urge decriminalization. The also
add the sensible caution that all drugs are dangerous drugs. Many
drug war proponents are aware of these studies but mysteriously,
they continue a reign of bloodshed in spite of the evidence. They
continue to panic the nation with myths and half truths about
drug use. Based on fictions, and fallacies, the drug warriors
extract billions of dollars from the public treasury and ruin the
lives of people who, in many cases, are already in ruinous
condition and need medical attention. </p>

<p>At the beginning of their book, Dr. Grinspoon and Mr. Bakalar
quote another, earlier Harvard professor, Alfred North Whitehead.
Whitehead said, &quot;The rejection of any source of evidence is
always treason to that ultimate rationalism which urges forward
science and philosophy alike.&quot; </p>

<p>Many Americans are in step with this sentiment and condemn
those people who champion violence and drug hysteria as
committing precisely this kind of treason. The evidence that
urges use to decriminalize drugs and stop the violence is
plentiful. </p>

<p>I find it hard to imagine that the drug warriors are really so
dull-witted that they cannot grasp this evidence or that they
cannot grasp the findings of their peers. In fact, it is entirely
possible that some of them actually do grasp the facts and
dishonestly argue against them. But why would anyone do that? </p>

<p>Dr. Grinspoon and Mr. Bakalar make a fascinating suggestion as
to why this could be true. They say, &quot;Attitudes toward
minorities, work, worldly success and failure, sex and family
life may be the real issues in the controversy about drugs. Drugs
are symbols charged with cultural tension. Repressed anxieties
may be displaced onto drug users as a form of scapegoating.&quot;
</p>

<p>The authors point out that &quot;We do not fine or jail the
patients of someone who practices medicine without a license, or
the customers of a manufacturer who disobeys consumer protection
laws, yet mere possession of cannabis and other illicit
psychoactive drugs is a Federal crime. The metaphor of war is
rarely invoked in the name of consumer protection but constantly
used in the assault on psychoactive drugs. The reason is that
laws controlling these drugs are ultimately aimed not at consumer
protection but at containing what is believed to be a threat to
the social fabric and moral order.&quot; </p>

<p>But, in light of all the government studies, and the growing
number of Americans who have signed the Hoover Institution's
Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy, it is right
to wonder if the drug soldiers themselves might not have fallen
over on the wrong side of the moral fence. <br>

<h2>PCP and Violence </h2>

<p><b>excerpted from : Drug Abuse and Drug Abuse Research, an
annual report to congress by the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human
Services, pg. 153. (1991)</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;There are two aspects to phencyclidine (PCP)
intoxication that have warranted particular attention by the
general public, as well as by law-enforcement and clinical
personnel. Both aspects concern the relationship between
phencyclidine abuse and aggressive behavior. There are reports of
increased aggressiveness and 'super-human' strength that develop
in some people who take phencyclidine. </p>

<p>Recent studies, including those of men arrested for criminal
activity in Washington D.C. and New York City (Wish 1986) and
evaluations of published clinical reports of phencyclidine
intoxication (Brecher et al. 1988), indicate that if
phencyclidine induces violent, criminal behavior, it does so only
extremely infrequently. </p>

<p>Although Wish (1986) noted that most men who had urines
positive for phencyclidine were younger than those who had taken
no drugs or other drugs, their crimes were likely to be less
aggressive than the crimes of those who had not taken
phencyclidine. </p>

<p>Khajawall et al. (1982) found no difference in the behavior of
clients admitted for phencyclidine detoxification and those
admitted for opioid detoxification. Thus, phencylidine-induced
aggression appears to be a rare phenomenon, if it occurs at
all.&quot; </p>

<p>MARIJUANA...THE INSIDIOUS DRUG </p>

<p>(Books Pot Safari and Marijuana Alert, Peggy Mann, McGraw
Hill) </p>

<p>THC </p>

<p>Known &gt;300 years for its psychoactivity </p>

<p>delta-nine tetrahydrocannabinol </p>

<p>a) regular grade </p>

<p>b) Sensimilla </p>

<p>c) Hashish </p>

<p>d) Hash oil </p>

<p>Needs heat activation (smoking, tea or brownies) </p>

<p>Currently, plain marijuana up to 9x stronger than in 1973. </p>

<p>1973 1983 </p>

<p>reg 0.5% THC 3.5% THC </p>

<p>sensi 6% 10-12% </p>

<p>hashish 8% 15% </p>

<p>oil 15-30% 20-60% </p>

<p>Regular grade...seeds etc. Backyard variety </p>

<p>Sensimilla &quot;preferred&quot; mature seedless female plants
grown away </p>

<p>from male. The largest cash crop of California, Oregon and
Hawaii </p>

<p>and second nationally behind corn. One plant costs $200 to
grow, </p>

<p>worth up to $2500. 25% is grown in US national forests, often </p>

<p>booby-trapped. In 1975 worth $400 per pound, now $3500 per
pound. </p>

<p>In Ohio in 1987 25% of plants confiscated, about 255000 plants
</p>

<p>left or $540 million. </p>

<p>Hashish...made in Pakistan/Afganistan and imported.
Deteriorates </p>

<p>at about 10% per month. </p>

<p>Hash Oil is the concentrated form which is put on a cigarette
to </p>

<p>double the potency. </p>

<p>PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>More carcinogens than tobacco. More lung irritation than
tobacco. </p>

<p>More number of carcinogens than tobacco. </p>

<p>If ingested has erratic absorption and is deactivated in the </p>

<p>liver like narcotics are...thus less potent but longer high. </p>

<p>If smoked, about 100% of the THC is absorbed into the </p>

<p>pulmonary system and then into the fatty system ie. brain, </p>

<p>testicles and ovaries, heart. </p>

<p>See reddened eyes and increased heart rate due to THC. </p>

<p>ANIMAL STUDIES </p>

<p>THC attaches to the cerebellum, spinal cord and hippocampus. </p>

<p>Hippocampus is responsible for short term memory. If removed--
</p>

<p>global amnesia. THC in rats causes brain cell death. </p>

<p>Monkey studies...smoke 5 days/week x 1 year then free x 1 </p>

<p>year caused profound lack of interest in learning and no
memory. </p>

<p>Same experiment smoking weekend only caused moderade damage
and </p>

<p>loss of memory. These were permanent changes. </p>

<p>Does it do this in humans? Our current users will be the </p>

<p>guinea pigs for this experiment. Scientists expect the answer
to </p>

<p>be yes. </p>

<p>EFFECTS IN HUMANS </p>

<p>Affects behavioural mood and memory functions. Decreases
cerebral </p>

<p>blood flow while smoking. </p>

<p>Of students failing or leaving school, 1/25 were not pot </p>

<p>users, 3/5 of students regularly smoking pot failed. </p>

<p>Flight simulator and pilors after 1 cigarette...each pilot </p>

<p>did significantly worse with one pilot missing the runway. </p>

<p>Significantly, all pilots thought they were doing very well. </p>

<p>The single greatest risk factor for cocaine abuse is </p>

<p>marijuana use before age 15. </p>

<p>AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME </p>

<p>1. Loss of interest, apathy, desire to work </p>

<p>2. Fatigue, loss of energy/tiredness </p>

<p>3. Depression/attacks of rage when provoked </p>

<p>4. Slovenliness in habits and appearance </p>

<p>For chronic users, clearly has been shown that memory tests
and </p>

<p>auditory and visual retention tests were poorly done even
after 6 </p>

<p>weeks of sobriety. </p>

<p>In a study of alcohol/pot related accidents, suggested pot may
be </p>

<p>responsible for more accidents than alcohol (due to impaired </p>

<p>judgement etc) </p>

<p>In a number of cases, heavy use 4-5x a week up to 15
cigarettes </p>

<p>per cay caused amnesia for the first 7-8 days of sobriety. </p>

<p>Amnesia was not recognized by the user. </p>

<p>Sheba=PCP added. Smells like embalming fluid </p>

<p>Few drops of vinegar in urine will give negative marijuana
test </p>

<p>Drug screen 50-75 level CANNOT BE PASSIVE. No false positives.
It </p>

<p>is like a fingerprint. In a job screen should always do a </p>

<p>confirmation titer if a screen is positive. </p>

<p>CHEMICALS IN MARIJUANA </p>

<p>421 chemicals. 65 are different cannabinols which are </p>

<p>psychoactive (delta-nine most) Others include non-cannabinols </p>

<p>such as toxins, carcinogens (such as tar, just like the tar on
the </p>

<p>road) and inactive or potentiating agents </p>

<p>Alcohol takes 6-8 hours to get out of body </p>

<p>THC is fat-soluble, and 50% will be in the body 1-2 weeks
later. </p>

<p>May take up to 4 months to get all out. Heavy use for 6-12
months </p>

<p>will give positive drug screen 4-6 weeks later. </p>

<p>A chronic pot user is raraly sober. Subclinical </p>

<p>intoxication. 2-3 times a week sufficient for this. Level </p>

<p>released from fat as acute level drops. Stored in all fat and </p>

<p>also in the basic building cells of the body. </p>

<p>Damage is DOSE RELATED. Depends on frequency and on </p>

<p>concentration. The more mature the person the less permanent </p>

<p>damage. Symptoms are insidious and subtle and can parallel </p>

<p>adolescent adjustment symptoms. THC exaggerates these
symptoms, </p>

<p>makes them more profound and often permanent. Saturation in
the </p>

<p>brain causes memory impairment, concentration impairment and </p>

<p>motivation impairment. Can be a major personality change. As
the </p>

<p>brain level decreased THC moves from other body fat to the
brain </p>

<p>to keep the brain saturated. Can actually prevent the
cognitive </p>

<p>changes needed for an adolescent to change to an adult,
leaving </p>

<p>him/her with poor social judgement, poor attention span,
confusion </p>

<p>and anxiety and loss of train of thought. Occasionally
produces </p>

<p>hyperactive/aggressive/agitated person instead of apathy. This
</p>

<p>damage can occur in MONTHS rather than years. ALL USERS </p>

<p>REGARDLESS OF AGE AND ABILITY HAVE DECREASED ABILITY IN
COMPARISON </p>

<p>TO THEIR POTENTIAL ABILITY. Regression to immaturity can occur
</p>

<p>and can be irreversible. A teenager can develop, for example,
a </p>

<p>mental age of 11 and thus not be able to complete school work </p>

<p>causing a dropout from school. </p>

<p>Pot more potent than in past years, age of onset much earlier </p>

<p>and thus the profile of a marijuana user is changing. </p>

<p>a) much higher suicidal ideation and depression </p>

<p>b) 1/3 show borderline schizophrenia traits with disorganized </p>

<p>thought patterns. </p>

<p>c) Paranoia increasing </p>

<p>d) Lots of similarities to a senile adult. Difference in time </p>

<p>perception (10 minutes seems like 1 hour). Erratic junk foods.
</p>

<p>Poor judgement. Cannot self-correct. Much like Altzheimer's </p>

<p>disease. </p>

<p>e) As use continues with subacute intoxication, decreasing </p>

<p>cognitive ability, decline in emotional life, much increase in
</p>

<p>stubbornness. More fatigue, decreased ability to do complex </p>

<p>tasks, no self-insight, no idea of time and dates, impaired
short- </p>

<p>term meory and occasionally long-term as well. With Moderate
dose </p>

<p>get profound gross impairment of motor skills. (See how much
like </p>

<p>brain-damaged adult?) With high dose can get hallucinations. </p>

<p>Feel that THC may be the cause of massive adolescent
psychiatric </p>

<p>problems. MUCH PROOF HERE and much refusal of the user to take
</p>

<p>this information seriously...still relying on the information
from </p>

<p>the 1960s that THC was not harmful. User does not wish to look
</p>

<p>the data straight in the eyes. </p>

<p>Major driving impairments...&quot;behavioural toxicity&quot;.
The </p>

<p>stoned person does not perceive the dangers. He can briefly
hide </p>

<p>the influence and pay attention but easily loses focus. Coming
</p>

<p>down from a high may be the worst for motor skills.
Occasionally </p>

<p>get a triggered unexpected after-high. </p>

<p>39% more likely to have a driving accident if smoke THC and </p>

<p>drive. Reckless driving, failure to yield, failure to stop. </p>

<p>How to tell if the memory/behavior is THC? STOP for two </p>

<p>months and see if symptoms go away. </p>

<p>MARIJUANA ADDICT </p>

<p>1. First stage is exposure. </p>

<p>2. Second stage...the person learns the mood swing, starts to
use </p>

<p>it as a drug and seek it and plan for its use = second stage
of </p>

<p>addiction. </p>

<p>3. Third stage..user becomes preoccupied with the mood swing. </p>

<p>Develops tolerance. May use 3-4 x per day up to 15 per day =
much </p>

<p>increased tolerance. Develops a preoccupied with chemical </p>

<p>dependence life style. </p>

<p>4. In the fourth stage the addict is using the drug to be
NORMAL. </p>

<p>Uses first in the AM, last at night, using it just to
function. </p>

<p>*Stages three and four...the patient usually cannot stop on
his </p>

<p>own but needs a formal treatment program. </p>

<p>For those who have smoked more than 1000x in three or four
years: </p>

<p>70-80% have tried cocaine </p>

<p>1/3 have tried heroin </p>

<p>Only 0-1% of heroin users never smoked pot. </p>

<p>The percentage of use of cocaine is directly related to the </p>

<p>frequency of use of pot. </p>

<p>In stage four with increased tolerance the addict uses more </p>

<p>of the higher grade THC, starts mixing drugs, seeks out more
heavy </p>

<p>using friends. The addict is very seriously disabled with
social </p>

<p>and psychological disabilities, panic attacks, nausea et.c Ego
</p>

<p>deterioration develops (with the denial that the drug causes
the </p>

<p>problem, it follows that the person himself must be causing
the </p>

<p>problem. This brings out guilt and shame which recycles to use
of </p>

<p>more drugs). </p>

<p>See social and school deterioration, dropping off team, </p>

<p>dropping hobbies. Finally psychotic-like fog in thinking. </p>

<p>**This can last as long as two or more years after drug
cessation. </p>

<p>SYMPTOMS CHECKLIST FOR LEVEL OF ADDICTION </p>

<p>Three predominant symptoms are </p>

<p>a) progressive chemical use </p>

<p>b) chemically oriented lifestyle </p>

<p>c) increasing tolerance </p>

<p>Parents should be aware...addicted teenager will use avoidance
</p>

<p>techniques, visine in eyes, frequently changes the room (more
drug </p>

<p>oriented pictures etc) dropping grades. </p>

<p>Often a strong family history of chemical dependency or
alcohol </p>

<p>dependency. Usage of THC not hereditary but the addiction </p>

<p>development probably is. </p>

<p>TREATMENT </p>

<p>Marijuana is an isolator. Questions asked are &quot;Where did
you </p>

<p>get it&quot; and &quot;How can I get some&quot;. NOT a drug
that explores </p>

<p>feelings. Feelings (mad glad sad) tend to be suppressed. </p>

<p>Treatment must explore feelings and teach its vocabulary.
Group </p>

<p>therapy can help. </p>

<p>Treatment must teach alternative ways to cope...how to handle </p>

<p>a headache (user does not handle pain well...has avoided the </p>

<p>feeling of pain in the past). Must set rules and limits. Must </p>

<p>address the amotivational syndrome in the treatment program. </p>

<p>Avoid the assignment to &quot;read a book and write how to
talk </p>

<p>with people&quot; but give the assignment to DO the behavior.
Remember </p>

<p>the immaturity and the age level caused by the drug when
making </p>

<p>assignments. </p>

<p>Treat the denial. &quot;No big thing&quot; is not true. You
have </p>

<p>school failures, family dysfunctions etc. </p>

<p>Work with the twenty harmfuls to get to deal in reality. </p>

<p>encourage that what is real within the group can occur outside
of </p>

<p>the group as well. <br>

departments during fiscal year 1990 was $20.6 billion </p>

<p>(employing 460,000 full-time people). This was 20 percent more
than in 1987, when local police expenditures were $17.2 billion. <b>(LEMAS

<h2>The Human Cost of Punishment: People of Color Bear the Brunt </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">If incarceration trends continue, we will have 7.5
million people in prison before the turn of the century. Of
those, four million will be Black. There are only 5.5 million
Black men between 18 and 39 in the nation. </p>

<p><b>(National Council on Crime and Delinquency, Crime Reduction
Policy, 1992)</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">23 percent of all Black men are caught up in the
criminal justice system: in prison, on probation or on parole.
There are more Black men in prison today than in college. For
every Latino male with a college degree, there are 24 behind
bars. 60 percent of inmates are either Black or Latino. (<b>Washington

12 percent were Latino; 61 percent of state prison inmates in

<h2>Imprisonment and Crime </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">The states with the lowest crime rates have the
lowest imprisonment rates, and states with the highest crime
rates have the highest imprisonment rates There is no evidence
that imprisonment reduces crime. <b>(James Austin and Marc Mauer,
USA Today, January 27, 1994</b>) </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22"
height="22">San Diego and Dallas have about the same rate of
police-to-population ratio, yet Dallas has twice as much crime
reported to the police. Cleveland and San Diego, meanwhile, have
comparable crime rates even though Cleveland has twice as many
police per capita. Moreover, Washington, D.C., has both the
highest murder rate and the most police per square foot of any
city in the Western world. There doesnt seem to be any direct
relationship between the amount of police and the crime rate. </p>

<p>Even if the nation's police forces were doubled from 1 to 2
million, we could still expect, at best, only a modest decrease
in crimes. My conclusion is that there is no law enforcement
solution to the crime problem. The factors that affect crime age,
sex, race, social class, poverty, unemployment rates,
illegitimacy, AFDC all those kinds of things are really beyond
the reach of a law enforcement community. And, therefore, crime
cannot really be materially affected by the use of law
enforcement, or even correctional strategies. <b>(Richard Moran,
Professor of Criminology, Mount Holyoke College, in an interview
with NPR)</b> <br>

<h1>FACTS ABOUT MARIJUANA </h1>

<h2>Marijuana: Drug of Deception </h2>

<p><b>A publication of the Lions Club</b> </p>

<p>This is the full text - unedited -- of a brochure on marijuana
put out by the Lions Club International. </p>

<p>The statements made about marijuana range from laughable to
ridiculous. None of them, that I can find, are supported by any
kind of scientific evidence, except maybe for that stuff about
the red eyes. They even say that marijuana use causes weight
loss! Curiously, they do not mention &quot;the munchies.&quot; </p>

<p>Readers are encouraged to write to the Lions Club at the
address below and correct their misinformation by pointing to
these web pages. </p>

<hr>

<p>Marijuana is made from the leaves, small stems, and flowering
tops of the Cannabis sativa plant. Marijuana, also called pot,
grass, weed, is usually smoked in a loosely- rolled joint or in a
pipe. It has a sweet, lingering odor. </p>

<p>Marijuana causes the user to experience a feeling of
well-being---of detachment from ordinary circumstances. This
&quot;high&quot; is usually followed by feelings of depression. </p>

<p>Marijuana is not just one substance; it contains more than 400
chemicals. The most widely known compund in this group is
commonly called THC (delta- 9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol). </p>

<p>THC is the primary mind-altering ingredient in marijuana. A
portion of THC is absorbed into fatty tissue in the brain and
reproductive organs, and in most other organs as well. It takes
the body at least 30 days to eliminate all effects of smoking one
marijuana joint. </p>

<p>Marijuana is up to ten times more potent today than that which
was produced in the 1960s. </p>

<p>Some experts previously thought Marijuana to be harmless. It
is now known that the reasons users can stop smoking without
feeling severe withdrawal symptoms is because of the body's
storage of THC. Effects of Marijuana on the body </p>

<p>* Marijuana reduces brain energy, impairing the users' ability
to remember, feel, think, anticipate, and predict. </p>

<p>* Because THC is stored in fatty tissues and works like a
time-release capsule, regular marijuana smoking produces a
constant state of sedation. </p>

<p>* Since THC remains in the center of motivation of the brain,
it weakens the users' ability to live drug-free. </p>

<p>* The lungs of marijuana smokers are highly susceptible to
emphysema and bronchitis. </p>

<p>* Research shows that marijuana contains cancer-causing
agents. </p>

<p>* Marijuana impairs normal sexual development in both males
and females. </p>

<p>* Heartbeat rate increses by as much as 50% through marijuana
use. Results are chest pains, and possible heart disease. </p>

<p>* Regular use causes a decrease in the blood supply to the
heart, and diminishes white cell production. </p>

<p>* The body adjusts to regular use, making it essential to
increase the amount used in order to achieve a &quot;high&quot;. </p>

<p>* Continual marijuana use deteriorates the body's immune
system. </p>

<p>Symptoms of Marijuana use </p>

<p>* Marked change in behavior patterns </p>

<p>* Carelessness about personal appearance </p>

<p>* Lack of motivation </p>

<p>* Reduction of short-term memory </p>

<p>* Excessive irritability </p>

<p>* Red eyes and fatigue </p>

<p>* Abrupt mood changes/outbursts of anger </p>

<p>* Less concern for the feelings of others </p>

<p>* Bouts of depression/paranoia </p>

<p>* Inability to react quickly/decreased coordination </p>

<p>* Inability to get along with family/co-workers/peers </p>

<p>* Loss of weight </p>

<p>* Sleeplessness [to go with the fatigue I suppose] </p>

<p>* Short concentration-span </p>

<p>* Highly susceptible to common infections </p>

<p>* Expressionless speech/blank stares </p>

<p>* Faulty perception (cannot accurately judge distances, speed
or time) </p>

<p>* Decreased academic or work performance </p>

<p>Marijuana connection </p>

<p>Some researchers have found a direct link between increased
marijuana use, and </p>

<p>--juvenile and young adult crime such as theft </p>

<p>--truancy and school drop-out rate </p>

<p>--psychiatric referrals of adolescents and young adults </p>

<p>--cases of teenage chronic organic brain syndrome (burnout) </p>

<p>Lions Drug Awareness Program </p>

<p>Since its inception in 1984, the Lions Drug Awareness Program
has emphasized prevention through education. Lions are working
together to join families, educators, and other key leaders in a
concentrated effort to create drug-free communities. </p>

<p>Lions' primary focus is Lions-Quest &quot;Skills for
Adolescence,&quot; and Lions-Quest &quot;Skills for
Growing.&quot; These positive prevention curricula span
Kindergarten through eighth grade, and are helping young people
choose healthy lifestyles. </p>

<h1>Three articles on the Drug Problem </h1>

<p><b>From the Economist May 15 -21, 1993</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>In 1883, Benjamin Ward Richardson, a distinguished British
doctor, denounced the evils of drinking tea. He said it caused an
&quot;extremely nervous semi-hysterical condition&quot;. In 1936,
an article in the American Journal of Nursing claimed that a
marijuana taker &quot;will suddenly turn with murderous violence
upon whomever is nearest to him&quot;. Tea and marijuana have
three things in common: they alter the moods of those who take
them, they are regarded as tolerable safe, and they are
addictive. </p>

<p>Attitudes to addiction are complicated and often
contradictory. Tea and marijuana are in themselves fairly
harmless, yet tea is generally legal and marijuana is not.
Tobacco and cocaine are harmful but, again, tobacco is almost
universally allowed, whereas most readers of The Economist live
in countries which may imprison you for possessing cocaine. </p>

<p>Throw in the joker of addictions which come not in syringes or
cigarettes, but in casinos and computer cartridges, and you have
a fine arena for combat between libertarians and puritans. </p>

<p>This battle, always lively, has just become hotter. On April
28th Bill Clinton appointed Lee Brown, a former policeman, as
America's new &quot;drug tsar&quot;, and thus leader of the
worlds toughest prohibition programme. Ten days before, Italians
had voted to move in the other direction by scrapping the
harshest measures of their drug laws. </p>

<p>Such boldness is rare. The attitude of most electorates and
governments is to deplore the problems that the illegal drug
trade brings, view the whole matter with distaste, and sit on the
status quo--a policy of sweeping prohibition. Yet the problems
cannot be ignored. The crime to which some addicts resort to
finance their habits, and in which the suppliers of illegal drugs
habitually engage, exacts its price in victims' lives, not just
money. The illegal trade in drugs supports organised crime the
world over. It pulls drug-takers into a world of filthy needles,
poisoned doses and pushers bent upon selling them more addictive
and dangerous fixes. </p>

<p>Yet most people still balk at exploring ways in which a legal
regime might undermine such effects. Their refusal owes something
to a distaste for addiction in itself. This is an argument shot
through with inconsistency. The strongest disapproval often comes
from those who scream about liberties if their own particular
indulgences--for assault rifles, say--are attacked. Addiction to
cigarettes is reckoned to be the chief avoidable cause of death
in the world. Alcohol deprives boozers of their livers and their
memories, and ends the lives of all too many innocents who get
smashed on the roads by the inebriated. Yet here the idea of
dissuasion within the law is broadly accepted. </p>

<p>A much sounder basis for doubt is the worry that legalisation
would increase drug-taking, and that rising consumption and
addiction would overwhelm the gains to be had from getting drugs
within the law. Yet legalisation should not be taken to mean a
lawless free-for-all, with no restraint on the supply or use of
drugs. Done properly, it would allow governments to take control
of the distribution and quality of these substances away from the
criminals. Quality control is decisive, because much of the
damage done by drugs bought on street corners is caused by
adulterated products; in much the same way, carelessly distilled
hooch can cause blindness. </p>

<p>Supply would be regulated by a system of government licences
analogous to those already in force for tobacco and alcohol (and
which would serve, among other things, to keep drugs out of the
hands of children), backed by strict policing and heavy
penalties. The toughness of the regime would rise with the
addictiveness of the drug in question--a light touch for
marijuana, an extremely dissuasive one for heroin.Such
legalisation would not magically dispense with the need for
policemen, but it would make the needed policing more manageable.
</p>

<p>Particularly in the business of softer drugs, where the taxes
can be lower and the restrictions less onerous, and where the
first trial steps towards legalisation should take place, it
would undermine the &quot;risk premium&quot; that provides drug
cartels with their profits. Taxes raised on what is reckoned to
be the world's largest untaxed industry would help governments
spend money on treatment and education, which would do more good
than the billions currently spent on attempting to throttle the
criminal supply of drugs of all sorts. </p>

<p>The Quest for Soma </p>

<p>There is another consideration, one for the future. The
illegality of drugs, coupled with distaste for pleasurable
addiction, is skewing research. Progress is being made by
scientists in understanding both what causes the pleasure of
drugs and what makes the pleasure so hard to give up. Currently
such research is obliged to have only one aim--unhooking existing
addicts. </p>

<p>It might have another. In many areas of pharmacology,
researchers are exploring the idea of &quot;designer drugs&quot;,
chemicals tailored to fit harmlessly into human biochemistry.
Addiction research should be encouraged to do the same: to move
beyond devising better therapies for those who wish to kick the
drug habit, into the invention of safer, more effective and less
habit-forming highs. At the moment it cannot, for a safe drug
equals a &quot;substance abuse&quot; equals a crime. </p>

<p>The fact remains that any legal regime which lowers the
economic incentive for drugs-crime will surely boost drug
consumption. The question is by how much. One possible pointer is
that, when asked, people say it will not rise a lot. In opinion
polls, Americans generally insist that they would not be
persuaded by legalisation to try drugs they are not taking now.
There is some reason to believe them, despite the first instinct
to be sceptical, since they already have access to plenty of
mindbending substances, from alcohol and tobacco to diet pills. </p>

<p>Then there is reassurance from experiments. The American
states that decriminalised marijuana during the 1970s saw no
divergence in the consumption of the drug from that in
neighbouring states which continued to prohibit it. Extensive
experience with decriminalisation in Holland shows that not only
is there no accompanying surge in consumption--allowing for the
inrush of addicts from more restrictive countries--but related
crime falls when drugs are legalised. </p>

<p>One further argument is used by defenders of the status quo.
They say that, even if the case for exploring legalisation were
conceded by governments, public resistance would doom the idea.
This is hardly surprising, given the way governments the would
over have for decades hammered home the dogma of prohibition. A
more rational discussion could do much to change public opinion.
Only a few years before alcohol prohibition was repealed in the
United States in 1933, public sentiment was similarly dominated
by the opinions of the country's prohibitionist leaders. </p>

<p>There are signs that public instincts are changing. In recent
months a growing number of federal judges and lawyers have voiced
their exasperation with America's approach to drugs. Their
objections led politicians in Washington to hold a meeting
earlier this month to rethink the country's failed drugs
policies. Janet Reno, the attorney-general, started the day be
describing her doubts about America's current approach. It ended,
significantly, with a discussion of the merits of legalisation.
Neither Mr. Brown nor Ms. Reno, and certainly not their boss Mr.
Clinton, has so far supported legalisation. But they have done
what no American administration has dared do in living
memory--set the scene for a proper debate. </p>

<h2>Drugs policy: The enemy within </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>A quiet revolt has been taking place in courtrooms across
America. It has been led by judges disillusioned with the
country's war on drugs. On April 29th Harold Greene, a prominent
federal judge in Washington, ruled that important elements of the
mandatory sentencing laws for drugs offenders were
unconstitutional. Less than two weeks earlier, two senior federal
judges, Jack Weinstein, and Whitman Knapp, of New York, had
announced that they would no longer preside over drugs cases. In
recent months, a number of federal judges have taken such a
stance. It might be a sign, much further down the road, of a
change in policy. Lee Brown, the former New York police chief who
was appointed as &quot;drug tsar&quot; by Bill Clinton on April
28th, is thought to be a good appointment. Apart from that, Mr
Clinton has not done much with drugs policy. Granted, he has been
in office a short while, and has had much to occupy him. But his
drug-policy staff has been cut, and the budget request he has
sent to Congress looks just like the one sent by George Bush. He
has asked for much the same amount of money, divided up in the
same way: two-thirds of the money to criminal-enforcement
efforts, one-third to treatment. </p>

<p>Some had hoped for a change of emphasis. Although the
&quot;war on drugs&quot; was first promoted by Richard Nixon in
1972, it was not until George Bush's term that the war began in
earnest. Mr Bush appointed though-talking drug tsars and spent
$40 billion to attack traffickers abroad and punish pushers and
users at home. The result has been disappointing. cocaine is
available about as freely and cheaply today as in 1989.
Drug-related violence in the cities is still high.The most
praiseworthy part of the Bush policy was a drop in overall
cocaine-taking. But hard-core addicts, who account for
four-fifths of all consumption, are taking as much as ever. Mark
Kleiman, of Harvard University, argues that Mr Bush's policies,
put in place soon after the peak in cocaine's popularity, did
little to affect a decline already under way. Changing fashion
(including the recent surge in heroin-taking) probably deserves
the credit for that. </p>

<p>If casual consumption of cocaine is down, it may well be the
result of education and treatment programmes rather than criminal
enforcement. But enforcement has been, and remains, the core of
American policy. Presidents, naturally, do not want to be seen to
condone the taking of drugs; the public temper is for stiff
penalties and the locking up of offenders, not tender care. But
the effect of the policy, as the American Bar Association pointed
out in a recent report, is that the country's prisons are filled
not only with drug-handlers but also with drug-takers, and cannot
cope with the numbers. Neal Sonnett, the head of the ABA's
criminal-justice section, notes with particular alarm the sharp
rise in incarceration of low-level drug offenders, which has
hindered efforts to fight more serious, and violent, crime. He
thinks the criminal-justice system may be &quot;on the point of
collapse&quot;. If it is, it will be for reasons to do with
overall levels of sentencing for many sorts of crimes, not merely
those related to drugs. But such arguments livened up a drugs
meeting held in Washington on May 7th to rethink America's
policies. At the start of the day Janet Reno, the
attorney-general, admitted dissatisfaction with the present
emphasis on enforcement efforts, and suggested the mandatory
sentencing guidelines might be reviewed. The speech confirmed
hints from Mr. Clinton that, despite his status-quo budget, he
plants to cut back on enforcement efforts, especially overseas,
in favour of trying to reduce demand at home. Another significant
aspect of the meeting was the openness of debate. Prohibition was
not unquestioningly supported. Ethan Nadelmann, a drugs expert
who heads the Princeton Working Group, which is developing
alternative ideas to prohibition, notes that legalisation of
drugs was given a serious hearing. The way forward, he believes,
is towards &quot;harm reduction&quot;. Such efforts, like the one
supported by Kurt Schmoke, the mayor of Baltimore, build on
programmes from parts of Europe and Australia which treat
drug-taking not as a criminal matter, but more as an issue of
personal choice and public health. </p>

<p>A small chorus has applauded such a shift in resources,
arguing that prohibition of drugs will always fail so long as
Americans remain so determined to get hold of them. Mr. Clinton,
who got himself in plenty of trouble during the campaign for not
inhaling marijuana, is unlikely to go that far. </p>

<h2>High and hooked </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p><b>A better understanding of how addictions work could provide
benefits for science, for medicine and for recreation </b></p>

<p>In 1964 Aryeh Routtenberg stuck electrodes into the brains of
his experimental rats. The electrodes were so positioned that
current flowing though them caused a particular pleasure. For one
hour a day, each rat could control this current by means of a
lever in its cage. Another lever, which also worked for just that
one hour, controlled the food supply. There was no contest
between the levers. The rats, too busy mainlining current to stop
for food, wasted away to ecstatic death. </p>

<p>The link between pleasure and addiction is not always so
extreme, but more mundane addictions have brought about millions
of less dramatic deaths outside the laboratory, and caused untold
misery and pain. The substances to which people get addicted,
though, also bring great pleasure to billions--some addicted,
some not. They are the basis of several multi-billion dollar
industries around the world. Some 60m Americans smoke tobacco;
three-quarters of West European adults drink alcohol; no one
knows how many people around the world consume caffeine in tea,
coffee or cola. Figures for illegal drugs are harder to come by,
but around 2m Americans are thought to take cocaine, and many
more than that have smokes marijuana. </p>

<p>Not all the people who indulge in these tastes are
addicts--that is, they do not depend on their habit in a way that
seems clearly abnormal to the bulk of people who do not share
their tastes. Though almost everyone who smokes tobacco is
hooked, drinkers are not necessarily alcoholics and not all
heroin users are hopeless junkies. Pleasure and the addiction
need not come together--either can be present without the other.
yet the two are obviously connected. Neuroscientists are now
using the tools of molecular biology to find the links between
them, deep in the recesses of the brain. </p>

<p><b>The kick from cocaine</b> </p>

<p>The cerebral nooks and crannies of interest are those between
nerve cells--synapses. To jump over the gap between two cells, a
nerve impulse has to be translated from electricity to chemicals
and back. The first cell releases a chemical called a
neurotransmitter into the synaptic gap. These molecules are then
picked up by receptor proteins on the surface of the second cell.
The neurotransmitter fits the receptor as a key fits a lock. The
unlocking of the receptor leads to the creation or suppression of
a nerve impulse in the second cell. </p>

<p>There are many different types of neurotransmitter, and thus
of synapse; different pathways in the brain need their different
properties. It is by subverting some of these synapses, and thus
some of the brain's pathways, that drugs produce pleasure. it is
through changing them in a more fundamental way that the drugs
cause addiction. </p>

<p>The first evidence for this is almost 20 years old. Recently
it has started to pile up quite quickly. In 1975 Solomon Snyder,
at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Hans Kosterlitz of the
University of Aberdeen in Scotland and John Hughes of
Parke-Davis, and English pharmaceuticals company, found out how
heroin, then drug-du-jour for worried policy-makers, works. Dr.
Snyder discovered there was a receptor protein in mammalian
brains which heroin would stick to. Dr. Kosterlitz and Dr. Hughes
reasoned that nature was unlikely to have produced such a lock
without also evolving a key. </p>

<p>Working independently, they found a chemical in the body that
fitted into the same receptor as heroin; Dr. Kosterlitz named it
&quot;endorphin&quot;. This type of neurotransmitter (there are,
it turns out, at least three different endorphins) damps down
pain by suppressing the signals which transmit it; it also
provides feelings of well-being. heroin acts as an ill-fitting
key which can open the lock but cannot then be withdrawn. The
synapse is over-stimulated. Unusually pleasurable sensations
result. </p>

<p>If you replace heroin and endorphins with nicotine and the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine, or with caffeine and adenosine,
or Valium and gamma-amino butyric acid, or marijuana and
anadamide, the same story can be told. Other drugs work in
slightly more subtle ways. Alcohol does not mimic a
neurotransmitter, but at least some of its effects come from
messing up the same synapses that heroin works on. Cocaine, which
has replaced heroin as the drug of concern in America, and has
thus been extensively researched, works on nerves that use the
neurotransmitter dopamine. These nerves are found in, among other
places, the mesolimbic system--the part of the brain which seems
to generate emotion. Cocaine subverts the pathway not by binding
to dopamine receptors, but by sticking to a molecule called,
inelegantly, the dopamine re-uptake transporter. </p>

<p>Nerve cells, canny little things, recycle their
neurtransmitters. Receptor molecules spit out their
neurotransmitters once they have served their purpose, and the
cell whence they came mops them up for reuse. Block this
re-uptake, and the transmitters will just sit in the synaptic
gap, stimulating the receptors again and again and again. Another
strategy is to jam the re-uptake system open, so that dopamine
flows though it the wrong way all the time, keeping the gap
suffused with the neurotransmitter. That is what amphetamines do.
</p>

<p>The fact that amphetamines and cocaine work in similar ways
will come as no surprise to anyone who has tried both. The nature
of the high a drug provides depends on the type of
neurotransmitter it interferes with. but the brain is a complex
place; the separate systems within it that use different
neurotransmitters all interact. A drug acting on one set of
synapses can have secondary and tertiary effects all over the
place. That is why drug experiences are so varied. The range of
things that can be addictive, though, is wider even than the
range of available drugs. Foreign bodies in the synapses are not
an absolute prerequisite for an addiction. Something as
straightforward as healthy exercise can, in the extreme, hook. In
the case of exercise it appears that the body becomes addicted to
the endorphins it produces to ameliorate the pain and stress. </p>

<p>Other behaviours that carry an intensity with them--and thus
presumable overstimulate some parts of the brain's wiring--can
produce similar effects, though the synapses involved have yet to
be charted. Gambling has many of the characteristics of drug
taking--a euphoric high, and a craving in the addict. Some people
believe themselves addicted to sex; lawyers in England recently
convinced a jury that a teenage hacker was addicted to computing.
</p>

<p>It is easy to see some such &quot;addictions&quot; as excuses,
especially as the term resists strict definition. But addiction
to chemicals is clearly real, and there seems no reason to
believe that compulsive chemical-taking is necessarily in a
different class from other acquired compulsive habits. Anyway,
chemical dependency is easier to study than other sorts. That is
why it has been possible to locate the roots of pleasure in the
synapses--and why it has been possible to find the roots of
withdrawal there, too. </p>

<p><b>Cold turkey </b></p>

<p>Clinically, addiction can be characterised by two things:
craving and withdrawal. Craving is still the subject of a certain
amount of scientific handwaving. The best the psychologists can
do is describe the process as one of positive
reinforcement--which means that if you like something, you will
tend to do it again. Having their receptors overstimulated is
something people tend to like a lot. How this &quot;liking&quot;
translates into neural circuitry is not yet clear. </p>

<p>Withdrawal, the physical and mental turmoil that follows when
an addiction is interrupted, is proving more tractable to
experimental analysis. A suggestive picture of how it works can
be pieced together, as long as you do not mind taking the pieces
from different studies of different drugs: work on cocaine by
Nora Volcow at Brookhaven National Laboratory, among others; on
cocaine and amphetamines by Bruce Cohen of McLean Hospital in
Boston; on heroin by Zvi Vogel at the Weizmann Institute in
Rehovot in Israel and Antol Shofelmeer at the Free University in
Amsterdam; an on benzodiazepines (such as Valium) by Erick Sigel
at the University of Berne. </p>

<p>Again, the synapse is the scene of the action. Most biological
systems have feedback mechanisms that help smooth out the little
fluctuations that life throws at them. Synapses are no exception.
The receiving cell can adjust itself to changes in the behaviour
of the transmitting cell in two ways. It can finetune the signal
the receptors pass on, and it can change the number of receptors.
The receptor molecules are conduits for information, with one end
outside the cell and the other inside. When a neurotransmitter
attaches itself outside, the part on the inside changes its
shape. In this new shape, it can accommodate molecules called
G-proteins, which hang around inside the cell. These G-proteins
are, themselves, also shape-changers. Interacting with the
receptor activates the G-proteins; these then head off to spread
the word via yet more molecules, called second messengers. </p>

<p>the second messengers tell the cell about the signal from the
neurotransmitters. One part of the cell that listens is the
system which sends out and suppresses nerve impulses. Another
avid audience is made up of the enzymes which add phosphate
groups to proteins, some of which help in the production of
impulses. More messages make them more active, and more likely to
add phosphate to receptor molecules. A phosphorylated receptor is
an unhappy receptor. It is reluctant to accommodate G-proteins
and thus to bring information in from the outside. The nucleus,
which controls the production of proteins, and also listens to
the second messengers. Lots of chatter from them suggests to the
nucleus that there are too many receptors at the synapse, so it
brings their manufacture to a halt. Insert an addictive drug into
the system and the din from the second messengers becomes
deafening. The result is fewer receptor molecules. Both the
phosphorylation of receptors and their absence means that it
takes more of the drug to obtain the same effect. Those high
doses, in turn, lead to even less sensitive synapses. And they
also lead to synapses that can no longer function without the
drug. The cell gets used to damming the flood of drug-induced
noise in order to be able to deal with the faint whispers of
reality that float on top of it. Remove the drug, and the normal
signals can no longer get over the barrier that has been erected.
The system goes from getting too much of the neurotransmitter's
effects to not enough; heaven turns to hell. </p>

<p>Put this way, the molecular picture seems obvious. It fits
with a common experience of addiction, that of needing to do more
and more of the drug just to keep from feeling bad. Of course, it
cannot be that simple--after all drugs that work on the same
neurotransmitter may vary in their addictiveness. And people
vary, too, in their susceptibility to addiction. Then again,
addictions to substances that affect different types of synapse
can be quite similar--and some people seem to be prone to
addiction per se, rather than just to have a weakness for a
particular substance. And the fact that addiction remains after
withdrawal has ended--a fact attested to at Alcoholics Anonymous
every day--suggests there is a more general problem to look at. </p>

<p><b>Dopamine heads</b> </p>

<p>For more evidence that addictions have something in common in
the way they act on the brain as a whole, no matter which
pathways they stimulate, look at the pictures on this page. </p>

<p>Edythe London, who works at America's National Institute on
Drug Abuse, studies glucose metabolism in the brains of people
with addictions. Glucose is the body's principal fuel, so its use
is a good index of how active an area is. Dr London's pictures
show that, in certain parts of the brain, addicts use less
glucose than non-addicts do. The difference applies regardless of
what drug is being used, and it is still visible when they are
not under the influence. </p>

<p>Other clues to a general theory of addiction have led
researchers to focus on the dopamine system--even when looking at
drugs which do not affect dopamine receptors. There is evidence
that many, and possibly all, addictions affect the dopamine cells
in the brain's mesolimbic system. In the case of cocaine this
effect is direct, which may account for the drug's peculiar
potency. for other drugs it seems to be indirect, brought about
by connections between the dopamine system and the other
neurotransmitter systems. </p>

<p>Inside the dopamine system, the researchers' attention has
lighted on D2. it should come as no surprise by now to hear that
D2 is a protein found in synapses, one of the three different
receptor proteins for dopamine. The detailed make-up of these
proteins can vary from person to person--variation that comes
from differences in the gene which describes the protein. So the
different variants of D2 are inherited. </p>

<p>It was inheritance that led the researchers to D2. In the
1970s a series of Danish studies compared the children and
step-children of alcoholic fathers. The former proved more likely
to succumb to the same addiction. This, and the evidence that
identical twins are more likely to share an alcoholic fate than
are non-identical twins, suggested that genes were playing a
role. In 1990, to great excitement, Kenneth Blum of the
University of Texas at San Antonio, and Ernest Noble of the
University of California, Los Angeles, announced that they had
found a gene peculiarly common among alcoholics. It described a
form of the D2 receptor known as A1. </p>

<p>This was challenged by several researchers, most notably
Kenneth Kidd, of Yale. Dr. Kidd points out that different ethnic
groups have different frequencies of A1, which could confuse the
statistics. Others, convinced by Dr. Blum, Dr. Noble and
subsequent work, have suggested that A1 frequencies may actually
explain differences in alcoholism between ethnic groups, though
this is far from certain. In 1992 George Uhl, of Johns Hopkins,
found that a second variant of D2, known as B1, seemed peculiarly
common in people addicted to tobacco, cocaine, heroin,
tranquillizers, marijuana and amphetamines as well as
alcohol--almost the whole list of commonly addictive substances.
This is at least as controversial as the original finding; its
meaning is not clear, nor is the nature of the difference between
the different D2s. </p>

<p>To link small variations in a single protein with the
existence of an all-purpose &quot;addictive personality&quot; is
to go a long way too far. But there is evidence in one case for a
link between personality and withdrawal symptoms--and to link
withdrawal symptoms to specific molecules is not too farfetched.
About 40% of people prescribed courses of benzodiazepines to
treat anxiety or insomnia can suffer some withdrawal
symptoms--souped-up versions of the symptoms the drugs are used
to treat--after the course of medication is finished. Peter
Tyrer, who worked at St. Charles' Hospital in London, has found
that the people who suffer withdrawal share not a specific
protein, but rather specific personality traits: insecurity,
inability to make decisions, an over-reliance on the opinions of
others. Spot them, and you can save people from withdrawal. </p>

<p><b>Better living through chemistry</b> </p>

<p>The links between proteins, the lowly building blocks of the
brain, and personalities, the high abstractions of the mind, are
undoubtedly going to be convoluted--but evidence from both ends
suggests they are there to be found. What are the pharmaceutical
companies, to which this should be of interest, doing about it? </p>

<p>Some work is going into drugs to treat drug addiction.
Naltrexone keeps heroin from activating endorphin receptors,
without activating them itself. Methadone works in the same way
as heroin, but less effectively; it thus provides a way off
heroin that minimises withdrawal symptoms. Similar approaches to
cocaine are being tried. Drugs which act on dopamine pathways in
general may have widespread effects on addiction. </p>

<p>but drugs to defeat dependence are not the only possibilities.
Some of the damage that comes from drug addiction, especially the
physical damage, comes from secondary aspects of the drug. Lung
cancer, for examples, is caused by the substances that accompany
nicotine in tobacco smoke, not by nicotine itself. It might be
possible to get rid of some of these problems without getting rid
of the pleasure, even if it is not possible to get rid of the
addictions. Another option is to develop tests which could tell
people if they were at risk of falling under a particular spell
so that they could choose their pleasures wisely. </p>

<p>Eventually, an understanding of neurotransmitters, receptors,
G-proteins, and second messengers might allow pleasure and
addiction to be decoupled--or at least allow withdrawal to be
suppressed. Though, on the face of it, the effects that cause
pleasure in the short term are those that cause addiction in the
long term, there is a lot of variability in the system that might
be exploited. Techniques like those used to target specific
dopamine receptors in the treatment of Parkinson's disease,
might, at least in principle, be used to fine tune a drug's
effects at the synapse and produce low-addiction highs. And pure
substances tailored to neurotransmitter sites would have a good
chance of being free of unpleasant side effects elsewhere in the
body. That would not create a brave new world; it might, perhaps,
create a slightly happier one. <br>

<h1>ABC News WAR ON DRUGS: </h1>

<h2>SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS: A Summary </h2>

<p>This is a summary of the major points of the show, as written
by Jim Hoffman </p>

<hr>

<p>On Thursday evening (Apr 6, 1995) ABC news aired the special
report: WAR ON DRUGS: SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS, which explored
harm reduction policy alternatives to the 'WAR ON DRUGS' as
practiced in the United States. </p>

<p>Although limited in scope -- the only drugs mentioned were
heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, and marijuana, with the focus being
on heroin -- I found the quality of the show very encouraging. </p>

<p>I encourage everyone to contact ABC News and commend them for
airing this special. For those who missed it, I have provided a
synopsis below. </p>

<p>Note: quotes are not necessarily verbatim; Names may be
misspelled. </p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ </p>

<p>AMERICA'S WAR ON DRUGS: SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS: A SUMMARY </p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ </p>

<p>STATED PURPOSE: </p>

<p>The claimed purpose of the show was 'not to advocate specific
policy' but to 'open up the discussion' and consider new
approaches, as this issue 'deserves debate'. It advised viewers
not to dismiss approaches just because they seem too radical. </p>

<p>TOPIC: </p>

<p>The show focused on those approaches to the drug problem known
as 'harm reduction'. Although marijuana was touched on several
times, the focus was on 'hard drugs' such as heroin. </p>

<p>FORMAT: </p>

<p>The show was composed primarily of excerpts of interviews with
various people, primarily advocates of harm reduction, stitched
together with narrative by Catherine Cryer and footage of police
raids, prisons, people shooting drugs, etc. </p>

<p>It is sprinkled with assertions by drug war zealot
extraordinaire William Bennet, </p>

<p>which are in most cases followed by refutations which look
much more reasoned. </p>

<p>SUMMARY: </p>

<p>The show opened with some observations: </p>

<p>* We are losing the 'War on Drugs'. </p>

<p>* There is a striking lack of public debate about alternatives
to current policies. </p>

<p>* The crime problem cannot be addressed without addressing the
drug problem. </p>

<p>and some facts: </p>

<p>* The 'War on Drugs' is the longest running war in US history.
</p>

<p>* Over 300,000 people are in prison for drug law violations. </p>

<p>* There are as many illegal drugs on the streets today as
ever. </p>

<p>It then interviewed Jim Montgomery, a paraplegic who was
sentenced to life imprisonment for 2 ounces of cannabis (later
reduced to 10 years) in Oklahoma. (He had no prior criminal
record.) He smokes marijuana to relieve the pain of his broken
back. </p>

<p>It quotes his attorney pointing out that violent offenders are
released from jail to make room for people like Jim Montgomery. </p>

<p>Next, three influential advocates of harm reduction in the USA
are introduced: </p>

<p>Conservative California Judge James Gray: </p>

<p>* declares the War on Drugs has turned into a war on our
people. </p>

<p>* points out nothing is accomplished by imprisoning drug
users. </p>

<p>* favors government regulated distribution of drugs coupled
with education. </p>

<p>Baltimore mayor Kurt Shmoke: </p>

<p>* points out violence in the drug trade is caused by profits,
not by drugs themselves. </p>

<p>* advocates taking the profit out of drug distribution,
through government distribution and a focus on education and
treatment. </p>

<p>* points out only 20% of addicts can get treatment. </p>

<p>New Haven police chief Nick Pastor: </p>

<p>* is shown interacting with inner-city youth talking about
drugs. </p>

<p>William Bennet summarizes the prohibitionist mindset: </p>

<p>'You will never persuade the citizens of this country that
drugs should be legalized.' 'It (drug use) is a deadly and
poisonous activity.' 'We must never admit defeat in the war on
drugs.' 'People should be imprisoned for long periods of time for
using drugs.' </p>

<p>Next it moves to Europe and looks at the experiences with harm
reduction in </p>

<p>Holland and Britain. </p>

<p>Holland </p>

<p>* Use of cannabis is tolerated (scenes of people smoking up in
coffee shops). </p>

<p>* Tolerance of cannabis is attributed for the prevention of
the use of hard drugs by youth. </p>

<p>* A large proportion of crime is caused by foreign tourists
comming from countries with more repressive drug policies. </p>

<p>* Prosecution is reserved for large distributors, not users of
even hard drugs. </p>

<p>* Since free needle exchanges were introduced the HIV
infection rate among IV drug users dropped from 11% to 4%, now
one of lowest in world. </p>

<p>* Public policy seeks to keep addicts healthy, productive
citizens. </p>

<p>* There is still a black market in hard drugs, which many
believe will not be eliminated until complete legalization is
implemented. </p>

<p>* Holland is pressured by the US to roll back its harm
reduction policy. </p>

<p>Britain </p>

<p>* Heroin maintenance, which seeks to stabilize and help
addicts by providing pharmaceutical heroin, is practiced. </p>

<p>* The physical health of junkies is ruined by adulterants in
illicit heroin. </p>

<p>(Pharmaceutical heroin can be used lifelong without medical
consequences.) </p>

<p>* People on heroin maintenance are able to lead relatively
normal healthy lives. </p>

<p>* If given a chance, most people mature out of addiction, so
heroin maintenance </p>

<p>buys time, allowing the user to build a life as an alternative
to addiction. </p>

<p>* A 15-fold reduction in crimes by addicts on heroin
maintenance has been documented. </p>

<p>* Many on heroin maintenance are eventually successful in
kicking the addiction. </p>

<p>Back to the USA ... </p>

<p>treatment: </p>

<p>* America's lack of commitment to treatment is highlighted. </p>

<p>* The success rate of treatment (American style) is at best
25%. </p>

<p>AIDS infection </p>

<p>* Ethen Nadelman, a harm reduction proponent, questions the
morality of policies </p>

<p>which result in IV drug users getting HIV, perhaps infecting
their lovers and children, and producing a huge economic burden
on society. </p>

<p>* A study of the effectiveness of needle exchange programs in
New York shows a drop in HIV infection among IV drug users from
6% to 2%. </p>

<p>Marijuana </p>

<p>* Dr. Lester Grinspoon, (author of Marijuana Forbidden
Medicine (not mentioned)) </p>

<p>dispels gateway theory of cannabis. He says cannabis is 'less
of a problem than tobacco or alcohol by orders of magnitude'. </p>

<p>* US Government reports dispel gateway theory. </p>

<p>* The 1972 Schafer Commission, appointed by Richard Nixon,
recommends the legalization of the possession and sale of small
quantities of cannabis. </p>

<p>* The partial adoption of this strategy in California saved
billions of dollars. </p>

<p>* The nation's leaders purposely ignore findings of Schafer
Commission. </p>

<p>William Bennet again </p>

<p>'law enforcement is very effective prevention' </p>

<p>'harm reduction policies would immediately lead to 50 million
hard drug users </p>

<p>in the USA' </p>

<p>* These assertions are both made to look rather dubious by
subsequent rebuttals. </p>

<p>Drugs and children </p>

<p>* PDFA commercials initially had &quot;great impact&quot; in
discouraging drug use. </p>

<p>* The lack of education has recently led to increased use
among kids. </p>

<p>(These two points I take issue with, as I attribute the
increase to a loss </p>

<p>of credibility brought about by exaggeration in 'drug
education'.) </p>

<p>* Due to prohibition there are pushers in schools - drugs are
readily available </p>

<p>in spite of (or because of) prohibition. </p>

<p>Memorable metaphor </p>

<p>Kurt Shmoke describes the drug war as a 'domestic Vietnam'. <br>

<p>Your Child and Stimulants </p>

<p><b>Growing up and exploring limits.</b> </p>

<p>from &quot;your child and stimulants, ISBN 90-71187-53-5, </p>

<p>Netherlands Institute on Alcohol and Drugs, The Netherlands. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h3>Trying is learning </h3>

<p>Young people will try out everything: arrive home late, drink
more alcohol than thirst dictates, challenge parents by ignoring
rules and generally pay no attention to well meant advice. One
moment they may reject any support the family may want to offer,
the next moment they apparently invite it. Similarly, one moment
they may wish to be left alone, the next they may look for warmth
and comfort. </p>

<p>You as a parent are almost certain to regognise this type of
behavior, if only because we all, at one stage, went through a
phase like this. This kind of &quot;testing&quot; behavior does
of course have a function. Young people have to try out different
things in order to be able to determine their own position and
their own behavior. </p>

<p>Anyone who is trying to discover what the limits are will have
first have to go beyond them. There is therefore no great cause
for alarm: for most adoloscents this is a normal step in their
development toward independence. Most young people are most
heavily influenced by the codes and norms that exist in their
peer group, for instance in the way they dress. It may surprise
you, but it is of the greatest importance to your child. It may
make the difference between belonging to the group or not, and
young people in particular want to be part of the group. </p>

<h3>First experience of stimulants </h3>

<p>Tobacco, alcohol, drugs and certain types of medicine can
endanger a person's health. Even so, they are widely used because
they provide a certain degree of enjoyment and pleasure as does
gambling. </p>

<p>Such stimulants are very easy to get hold of. Most children go
through a phase in which they want to try out that which is
unknown to them. It is therefore highly likely that your child,
also, will at one point be confronted with the choice;
&quot;shall I use this or shall I not use this.&quot; Your child
is perfectly capable to decide responsibly for him or herself. </p>

<p>The crucial question is how this decision will be perceived by
peers. If the decision matches the norms of the peer group, then
there is nothing to worry about. It is when the decision is
rejected that problems arise. For instance, when most members of
the peer group are used to drinking a lot of alcohol it may be
difficult for an individual child to say no to alcohol. Only very
few children are able to resist this kind of peer pressure
successfully and avoid placing themselves outside the group. </p>

<h3>The freedom to choose </h3>

<p>Every person has the right to make his own choices. Those who
are growing up still have to learn to deal with that freedom, if
only because their educators are not always present. Parents can
of course offer guidance but at the end of the way young people
have to be responsible for their own behavior. They therefore
must explore the limits of their own freedom, including
stimulants. </p>

<p>However,this is not all. There are a number of stimulants that
are highly addictive (see table at end). It is obvious that such
substances should never be offered to youngsters just to try them
out. In this respect, a gambling machine can cause similar
addiction. </p>

<h3>Minimizing the risks </h3>

<p>There is always a certain risk involved in trying out
stimulants. This does not necessarily mean, however, that you
should forbid their use just like that. If you do so your child
will simply try them out when you are not present thus making it
impossible for you to exert any kind of influence whatsoever.
Amuch better way of trying to minimize possible risk is to
monitor and guide your child as much as possible in this process
of trying out. </p>

<h2>THE STIMULANTS </h2>

<h3>The importance of knowledge </h3>

<p>If you want to talk about stimulants effectively and sensibly
it is important that you have the right basic knowledge about
them. Knowledge can take away unfounded fear. Lots of people
believe that smoking marijuana automatically leads to dependency
on hard drugs. This is absolutely not the case. The word
addiction, used in a general sense, often leads to all kinds of
misunderstandings. People can also be addicted to food or work
for instance. That is why the other term &quot;dependency&quot;
is used, and there is a difference between physical dependency
and mental dependency. </p>

<p>Physical dependency means that a person's body adjusts to a
substance that the person uses intensively. </p>

<p>Without that substance the body no longer functions prperly.
When the substance is withheld, different kinds of withdrawal
systoms bnegin to surface such as fever or nausea. </p>

<p>The use of certain substances has to be progressive in order
to achieve the same effect. This is what is called
&quot;tolerance&quot;. Physical dependency and tolerance are both
determined to a large extent by the stimulant and not the user. </p>

<p>Mental dependency is entirely different. It is determined to a
large extent by the user and not the stimulant. Mental dependency
is a simple matter of &quot;feeling good&quot; something tastes
&quot;good&quot; or makes you feel &quot;good&quot;, so much so
that you cannot do without it. The desire for the substance is
very strong and completely dominates a person's thinking. </p>

<p>The tables below illustrate mental dependency, physical
dependency, tolerance, short-term effects and long-term effects,
based on intensive use of stimulants. </p>

<p>We warn you that this overview is necessarily concise and
therfore not entirely complete. </p>

<h3>ALCOHOL </h3>

<p>mental dependency - high risk </p>

<p>physical dependency- yes </p>

<p>tolerance -yes </p>

<p>short term effect - person feels less inhibited (one or two
glasses), </p>

<p>sedating ( more than one or two glasses) impairs sense of
judgement, delayed </p>

<p>response, leads to over-confidence and indiffrence </p>

<p>long-term effects - serious damage to liver, brain, heart and
stomach. </p>

<p>important - dangerous in combination with other stimulants </p>

<h3>CAFFEINE (coffee, tea, cola) </h3>

<p>mental dependency - small chance </p>

<p>physical dependency - small chance </p>

<p>tolerance - yes </p>

<p>short-term effects - enhances concentration, suppresses
tiredness. </p>

<p>long-term effects - sleeplessness, restlessness </p>

<p>important - intensive use carries risk of cardio vascular
diseases. </p>

<h3>CANNABIS (marijuana, hash) </h3>

<p>mental dependency - small chance </p>

<p>physical dependency - no </p>

<p>tolerance - no </p>

<p>short-term effects - relaxing, boosts emotions, impairs
concentration and </p>

<p>response. High dose may lead to loss of consciousness. </p>

<p>Long-term effects - lung cancer </p>

<p>important - in combination with alcohol increases the effects
of alcohol </p>

<p>considerably. Risk of overdose when eaten (spacecake) </p>

<h3>COCAINE (including base &amp; crack) </h3>

<p>mental derpendency - high risk </p>

<p>physical dependency - no </p>

<p>tolerance - no </p>

<p>short-term effects - stimulating, surpresses tiredness and
appetite </p>

<p>long-terms effects - loss of weight, sleeplessness, delusions </p>

<p>important - exhaustion, dpression after stopping. the smokable
form of </p>

<p>cocaine is called crack or base. crack causes a much greater
degree of </p>

<p>dependency than cocaine. </p>

<h3>TRANQUILLIZERS </h3>

<p>mental dependency - high risk </p>

<p>physical dependency - small chance </p>

<p>tolernace - yes </p>

<p>short-term effects - relaxing, sedating, indifference,
overconfidence </p>

<p>long-terms effects - weight gain, inactivity, muscular
weakness </p>

<p>important - in combination with alcohol increases the effects
of alcohol </p>

<p>considerably. </p>

<h3>OPIATES (opium, morphine, heroin, methadone) </h3>

<p>mental dependency - high risk </p>

<p>physical dependency yes </p>

<p>tolerance - yes </p>

<p>short-term effects - decreased awareness of pain, euphoria,
reduced </p>

<p>awareness of fear, emotional numbness, constipation </p>

<p>long-term effects - indifference, reduced sexual activity </p>

<p>important - malnutrition, neglect of the body due to
indiffrence </p>

<h3>AMPHETAMINES (uppers) </h3>

<p>mental dependency - high risk </p>

<p>physical depency - no </p>

<p>tolerance - yes </p>

<p>short-term effects - increased ability to concentrate,
tiredness and sleep </p>

<p>are surpressed. loss of appetite, overconfidence </p>

<p>long-term effects - restlessness, irritablity, loss of weight,
fears and </p>

<p>suspicions, delusions and agressiveness </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>We wish to express our sincere appreciation to the students
who assisted us in the preparation of the tables at Appendix A.
Because the drug statutes of the several states are particularly
confusing and difficult to find, and because so many
jurisdictions have recently changed their drug laws, the
preparation of the chart required long, tedious work which so
many were kind enough to perform. To them, our most sincere
thanks. </p>

<p>We should like to thank especially Michael A. Cohen, John F.
Kuether, W. Tracey Shaw, Alan K. Smith, and Allan J. Tanenbaum,
all students at the University of Virginia School of Law, whose
research assistance and tireless effort were invaluable. </p>

<p>We are particularly indebted to Professor Jerry Mandel who
supplied us with much of the raw data used in the historical case
studies in this Article. In his excellent article on drug
statistics in the Stanford Low Review, Problems with Official
Drug Statistics, 21 STAN. L. REV. 991 (1969), Professor Mandel
suggested in a footnote that someone should attempt a history of
the passage of anti-marijuana legislation. We have followed his
suggestion and earnestly hope that our product will fill this
gap. </p>

<p>A modified and expanded version of this Article will be
published in book form in the spring of 1971.</p>

<h1>The Report of the California Research Advisory Panel </h1>

<p>The Drug Policy<b> </b>Foundation's </p>

<p>LEGISLATIVE FORUM ON DRUG POLICY </p>

<p>State Capitol, January 27, 1992 </p>

<p><b>FREDERICK H. MEYERS, M.D.</b> </p>

<p>Professor of Pharmacology, University of California, San
Francisco, CA </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Note from Cliff Schaffer: This was sent to me personally by
Dr. Meyers, with a few of his own hand written notes. He was the
head of the Research Advisory Panel for the State of California
and states that this speech paraphrases the conclusions of the
Research Advisory Panel. </p>

<hr>

<p>The premise of this meeting--- that the legislature must at
this time accept the suggestions of the nominal experts in
problems of drug abuse here assembled and begin the
decriminalization of drug use-- appears at first glance to be
presumptuous. It is not, however, if one considers our
deteriorating social and economic state and the forbidding
prospect of the adjustments that must<b> </b>be made by the
legislature at this session. </p>

<p>I think that no area of informed, disinterested thinking will
challenge the conclusion that whatever we have attempted by
legislation to regulate the use of the emotionally loaded street
drugs --- that is, excluding the laudable alcohol---has been
palpably damaging. The prohibition or legal approach has not been
merely ineffective but that approach, rather than the effects of
the drugs themselves, is responsible for the individual and
societal damage that so appropriately concerns us. Heroin, indeed
the non-medical use of narcotics in general, cannot be inherently
too dangerous or harmful or the legislature would not have
mandated the provision of methadone, a pharmacologically
equivalent narcotic, to some of our heroin habituated citizens. </p>

<p>It is, then, the reaction of society to the use of certain
drugs rather than the drug effects themselves that cause the
problems and damage that concern us. </p>

<p>I react to these problems as I see them in individual patients
and am most concerned about the damage imposed on the individual
by social drug use less dangerous to society than the use of
alcohol and by compulsive drug use that is not that different
from cigarette smoking. The physical damage and consequent cost
to society in medical care is much less with heroin, but,
cigarettes being legal and relatively inexpensive, the smoker is
not subject to the risk of prosecution or of being driven to
criminal activity. </p>

<p>A California legislator in 1992 would, I should think, be more
interested in the expense involved to the state and recognize an
area where budgetary relief can be achieved with a social and
humanitarian gain rather than the curtailment of a program of
some value. The financial burden at each governmental level of
enforcing laws whose violation cannot be managed by ordinary
police tactics is significant. Even greater is the expense and
disorganization imposed by the associated criminal activity on
police, jail, court, prison, probation and parole activities. </p>

<p>Now in deciding whether to accept my thesis, be influenced by
your own observations and common sense, which will establish the
clinching argument: all of the enforcement activity of the past
fifty years has been wasted in that the use of more and more
varied drugs has grown progressively to its present level. </p>

<p>Before discussing what changes should be made and in what
order, I will acknowledge and meet the fear of legislators that a
show of rationality will be interpreted as being &quot;soft on
drugs&quot;. This idea will be imposed, and the conclusions
presented here today will be challenged only by agents of what I
call the enforcement industry. (Or at least the <u>administrators</u>
of those agencies. I have not recently met an agent or
investigator working at the street level who thinks that the war
on drugs has been or can be won, and I do work with peace
officers.) </p>

<p>Workers in the enforcement area are given to protecting a
special position within police work. They are not disinterested
informants just as I am not a disinterested informant in matters
of pay and privilege for U.C. professors. They have great
influence on those citizens who depend on the daily media, press
or TV, or who confuse TV dramas with reality. The daily press is
not required to be accurate or comprehensive or to provide
follow-up; it is required only to report more or less accurately
whatever information, misleading or otherwise, is provided by an
informant who may not even be identified. Thus we have had a long
series of largest ever seizures, biggest dealer ever, etc, but it
is street level users who resorted to crime to
&quot;maintain&quot; who congest our system of criminal justice,
and we see no relief in the face of more and more money for
enforcement. </p>

<p>I insist that if you examine more deliberate, quality
journalism from as liberal as one dares to be today, for example,
<i>The Nation </i>, across the spectrum to Buckley's conservative
journal; if you examine the technical literature of medicine,
sociology and even economics and if you note the names and
positions of people supportive of organizations such as the Drug
Policy Foundation, you will agree with my statement above that no
area of informed, disinterested thought disagrees with the
conclusions of this meeting. Their agreement is often expressed
in terms of legalization of drugs, but, except for radicals like
Buckley and Greenspan, decriminalization is meant. </p>

<p>The time for academic discussion has passed. Now it is time to
think tactically, no longer asking if the drug laws should be
changed to achieve decriminalization but looking at what changes
should be made and in what order. </p>

<p>My discussion from here on, that is, the changes and tactics
suggested to the legislature, is almost entirely quotes or
paraphrases from a report to the legislature by the Research
Advisory Panel. I do not appear as a representative of that
group, but I see no reason why I should not exploit the
competence and effort reflected in the report. </p>

<p>The panel first established three prior cautions or bases for
deriving the changes: </p>

<p>1. Differentiate different drugs and different routes of
administration. Do not discuss the drug problem. </p>

<p>2. Separate drug effects from associated criminal activity. </p>

<p>3. Consider the risk/benefit ratio for any change. The goal is
to reduce the damage </p>

<p>done by a drug without significant increase in its use. No
unregulated (legalized) drug nor any industry comparable to
cigarette or alcohol industry proselytizing for drug use. </p>

<p>The panel then suggests a stepwise approach by the
legislature. The three changes suggested for the first year would
demonstrate that change could be safely accomplished and prepare
the public for more comprehensive revisions. </p>

<p>The suggested legislative changes are: </p>

<p><b><u>Allow Cultivation of Marihuana for Personal Use </u></b></p>

<p>Insofar as damage to the individual and society is concerned,
the quantitatively most important drugs are alcohol and nicotine
in the form of cigarettes. There remains, then, as the other
quantitatively important drug, marijuana, which has become, for a
large fraction of the population, a social drug comparable to
alcohol in pattern of use and approaching alcohol in extent of
usage. </p>

<p>Marijuana is a disinhibiting drug used socially to relieve
anxiety and as such has many liabilities in common with alcohol.
I acknowledge that marijuana is not without its effect on the
individual user and would not suggest any change that carried the
risk of a great increase in the use of marijuana. I resist the
use of the word &quot;legalization&quot; in relation to any drug,
including marijuana. On the other hand, an objective
consideration of marijuana shows that it is responsible for far
less damage to the individual and to society than are alcohol and
cigarettes. A further consideration in forming a reaction to the
wide use of marijuana is that is a source of conflict between
generations and of disrespect for the law. The huge cost of
attempting to enforce these disrespected laws and to punish their
infraction by people who do not feel guilty is, in my opinion,
entirely wasteful and damaging and the monies should be applied
in areas of greater need. </p>

<p>Also important is the economic and, to some extent, criminal
activity associated with the marketplace of marijuana. At the
moment, we are adding millions to our trade deficit, off of the
books to be sure, by our purchases of marijuana in Colombia,
Mexico, Thailand, and elsewhere. Yet, thanks to a previous action
of the California Legislature, the product of this illegal
activity may be possessed and used by the citizen with the
possibility of only minor sanctions. This change has not lead to
any disastrous consequences. On the contrary, it has reduced the
tension between generations and decriminalized to some extent the
generally sanctioned use of this new social drug by large numbers
of people. </p>

<p>This new situation, for which we applaud the Legislature, is
however, not stable, in the sense that the failure to act in
relation to the supply of the drug leaves unmet the question of
the still illegal market and the economic problem that that
entails. If this disparity could be resolved there would be
economic gain and a great simplification of law enforcement which
now devotes a considerable effort to seizing a small fraction of
the illegal importations or cultivations. </p>

<p>I therefore suggest that the law be changed to permit
cultivation for personal use. Such cultivation would be permitted
only on property serving as the residence for the individual,
this is, it would not authorize the cultivation of fifty plants
on a National forest and it would not permit the possession
outside of the home of more than the present one ounce, nor would
it sanction the provision to others in or out of the residence
whether by sale or in the form &quot;parties&quot;. </p>

<p>Any change regulating the provision of this drug <u>must</u>
be made in such a way that we do not see the development of
another industry comparable to the alcohol or cigarette industry.
Permitting the restricted cultivation would avoid that evil but
achieve an of the gains promised above. </p>

<p>There are people, including I am sure some legislators, who,
out of genuine concern rather than mere timidity, will wonder
whether such a change, however, warranted by social and economic
gains, would not also result in increased use. I do not dismiss
this justifiable concern out of hand. the Panel insisted, and I
agree, that no attitude of approval of marijuana, or alcohol, or
tobacco be projected. I would be a prohibitionist if prohibition
would work. To the extent that prohibition creates a marketplace
or social conflict, we suggest more flexible, practical, and
humane policies. It does ,however, appear that the supply and
experience with marihuana is such that a </p>

<p>plateau has been reached and that usage over foreseeable
circumstances will remain about at its present level, as is the
case with alcohol. </p>

<p><b><u>Remove Penalties for Possession of Needles and Syringes</u></b>
</p>

<p>The statement that heroin is inherently not a dangerous drug
has been weakened by the appearance in the community of the AIDS
virus. This virus is transmitted, among other ways, by the use by
one persons of paraphernalia for injection contaminated with the
blood of an infected person. The AIDS virus has already spread
through the, drug-using community to an extent that varies with
the sanitary practices of the local population. The prevalence of
infection is much higher, for example, in New York City than in
San Francisco and lower throughout the balance of California than
in San Francisco. There is thus some urgency and advantage in
instituting control methods. </p>

<p>There are two suggested methods of controlling the spread of
this relatively new virus. The first, demonstrably ineffective,
is to adopt a moralizing attitude, continue our current practices
and simple add the individual tragedy and economic burden to the
community of more AIDS patients. Such an attitude is consistent
with the feeling that heroin users (and gays and psychotics) are
better dead and is genocidal. </p>

<p>The other method of controlling the spread of the AIDS virus
would be to encourage sanitary practices at the time of injection
by <u>making</u> it possible for each heroin user to use his own
&quot;outfit&quot;, that is, syringe and needle, rather than
accept the risk of using one contaminated with another addict's
blood. This would become permissible as well as possible if the
intravenous (IV) drug user were permitted to legally possess his
own syringe and needle. </p>

<p>Heroin users understandably try to avoid carrying supplies of
their drug and their injecting paraphernalia any more than is
absolutely necessary since the mere possession of the substance
and the equipment is a punishable crime. The possession of
paraphernalia is defined as a misdemeanor. The availability of
the charge becomes a convenient mean of harassing the addict and
of subjecting him, in effect, to a three-day jail sentence
without trial. A person with a prior drug related conviction must
be especially careful since, in such a situation, even the
possession of an ordinary spoon can be construed, according to
the statute, as possession of paraphernalia. As a result, users
are reluctant to carry their own outfits and, their compulsion
being upon them, are quite likely to use whatever equipment is
available at the site of drug purchase. People driven by the
compulsion that the heroin user feels, and given their choice
between using someone else's outfit and being without their drug
will use the possibly contaminated equipment. Laudable as the
&quot;needle&quot; exchange programs are and admirable as I find
their practitioners, they (and the impending legislative respond)
are inadequate. The situation is too urgent for an
&quot;experimental&quot; program in one city and statutory change
is the definitive change needed to permit education in </p>

<p>proper practices by the junkie. </p>

<p><b><u>Prohibit (legal or illegal) Drug Use in Special State
Establishments</u></b> </p>

<p>At the same time that we carry out what will be seen as a
liberalization of some drug regulations we should demonstrate
that our ultimate goal is the reduction of all drug use. The
effectiveness of education in reducing drug abuse is obviously
disappointing. Not even the success in controlling cigarette
smoking extends to the youthful population. However, it is from
the successful imposition and acceptance of restrictions on
smoking by the adult population that we must learn. Drug
education efforts have focused largely on the populations that we
consider to be deviant and at risk, that is, young people and
minority groups. Our efforts to limit the use of quantitatively
important drugs should act to influence the entire population so
that an unambiguous attitude of disapproval is projected. </p>

<p>The amazing progress in dissuading people from the use of
tobacco, suggests additional action in relation to alcohol,
already a regulated drug. That prohibition is not feasible has
certainly been adequately demonstrated, but restricted use of
alcohol in inappropriate places is justifiable and would be an
essential step in projecting the attitudinal change desired. </p>

<p>The Panel applauds the establishment of tobacco free areas in
State institutions. As a condition of their funding the
Legislature should now insist that certain agencies within the
State system not sell or provide alcoholic beverages within the
confines of their campus or building. This should be immediately
applied to any medical center campus or hospital. Doctors and
other care-givers have a generally favored status and acquire
with that a special responsibility to project an attitude of
disapproval about the use of any disabling drug while they are
accepting responsibility for a dependent patient. Certainly the
State acquires a liability in providing alcohol to individuals
who are then going to drive or see patients. More importantly,
such use then projects an attitude totally at odds with that
which we claim throughout our discussions as desirable. </p>

<p>Similarly, it is impossible to rationalize the use of a
depressant drug, clearly shown to impair performance after small
doses, on a University or State University campus dedicated to
intellectual activity. </p>

<p><b><u>Conclusion</u></b> </p>

<p>These changes are minor indeed. However, they would achieve
some real progress and, equally important, would demonstrate to
the alarmed citizenry that constructive change is possible and
permit a freer discussion next year. I hope that the Legislature
senses the urgency in the situation in our state. I close by
threatening you with the aphorism of Francis Bacon of 400 hundred
years ago, &quot;He that will not apply new remedies must accept
new evils; for time is the great innovator.&quot; <br>

<h1>A WISER COURSE: ENDING DRUG PROHIBITION </h1>

<p><b>by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York</b> </p>

<p>June, 1994 </p>

<hr>

<p>The June 1994 issue of &quot;The Record,&quot; the official
publication of the Association of the Bar of the City of New
York, will include a recently released report by the
Association's Special Committee on Drugs and the Law. The report
is entitled &quot;A Wiser Course: Ending Drug Prohibition&quot;
(the &quot;Report&quot;). In typewritten form, the Report is 83
pages long and has 203 footnotes of sources and authorities. </p>

<p>On June 15, 1994, the New York Law Journal (the daily
newspaper for lawyers in New York) printed on page one a news
article about the Report. Unfortunately, the rest of the
&quot;media&quot; (e.g., the New York Times, The Daily News,
Newsday, ABC, CBS, NBC, C-SPAN, TBS) have failed, at least so
far, to take any notice of this Report. </p>

<p>To get the word out about this Report, the Association has
given permission for the Report to be distributed on the
Internet. A full-length copy of the Report (about 96,388 bytes
but without the 203 footnotes) is posted here for your reading
enjoyment. The dissent is also reproduced at the end. </p>

<h1>A WISER COURSE: ENDING DRUG PROHIBITION </h1>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION </h2>

<p>In 1986, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York,
responding to a general perception that criminal and civil </p>

<p>sanctions against the manufacture, distribution, or possession
of drugs were not &quot;solving,&quot; or even ameliorating, the
problems associated with drug use in our society, formed a
Special Committee on Drugs and the Law (the
&quot;Committee&quot;) to study our current drug laws and to
report its recommendations on the wisdom of such laws. </p>

<p>The Committee has considered the complex legal, social,
medical, economic, and political issues raised by our nation's
current drug control policies. Despite billions of dollars spent
on law enforcement, criminal prosecution, and incarceration
during the past 80 years, the United States has made little or no
progress toward reducing drug use or solving its &quot;drug
problem.&quot; On the contrary, illegal drug use remains a
pervasive and powerful influence in our cities and in the nation
at large. Beyond the continuing availability and consumption of
drugs, the unintended consequences of our current prohibition
policy are ubiquitous: our courts, both state and federal, are
jammed; our prison populations are burgeoning; urban and ghetto
children, as well as adults, are frequent victims of violent
&quot;turf wars&quot;; our civil liberties are being eroded,
along with our society's respect for the rule of law generally;
our public health is threatened; the enjoyment of urban life has
declined; and our nation's institutions, as well as those of our
South and Central American neighbors, are undermined by the
immense wealth accumulated illegally under the current
prohibition policies. </p>

<p>The Committee has concluded, in some cases reluctantly, that
the costs of drug prohibition are simply too high and its
benefits too dubious. </p>

<p>The Committee recognizes that calling for an end to drug
prohibition cannot be either the end of our inquiry or the sum of
our recommendations. There are several difficult questions that
remain to be answered: What forms of governmental regulation, if
any, are appropriate instead of prohibition? To what degree, if
any, should private distribution of drugs be permitted? Is a
regulatory regime similar to one now used to control alcoholic
beverages appropriate for some, if not all, drugs? How should a
new regulatory regime treat children, adolescents, or pregnant
women? What kinds of prevention and treatment programs should
there be and how should they be funded? </p>

<p>These and other issues demand both the urgent attention and
honest judgment of our Committee and, more broadly, our society. </p>

<p>The Committee believes the necessary inquiry cannot begin in
earnest so long as our nation remains committed to the illusion
that drug use can be prohibited at an acceptable cost. Only by
recognizing that this is no longer true can we fashion a method
of controlling drugs other than the current coercive drug laws,
which have been largely ineffective and which are sapping the
vitality of our cities, our legal system, and our society as a
whole. It is the Committee's hope that this report will advance
the discussion of this important issue. </p>

<h2>II. THE COSTS OF PROHIBITION </h2>

<h3>A. DISTORTION OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM </h3>

<p>At a time of ever-increasing competition for scarce public
funds, the volume of drug prosecutions and convictions continues
to increase, as does the strain on judicial budgets, personnel,
and facilities in the federal and state systems. The added
burdens on the judiciary due to drug prosecutions have
substantially diminished the courts' capacity to manage the civil
docket. Criminal cases take priority, with civil jury trials
relegated to the bottom of an increasing waiting list. Some
courts, for purely budgetary reasons, have been forced to suspend
all civil jury trials for periods of time. </p>

<h4>1. New York State </h4>

<p>The majority of drug cases are handled by state and local
courts. Consequently, it is instructive to review first the
impact of these increased caseloads and costs on New York State. </p>

<p>In 1991, New York State spent a total of $8,641,418,000 for
all judicial and legal services (including police protection,
$3,662,389,000; courts, $932,314,000; prosecution and legal
services, $461,790,000; and public defense, 197,194,000). It is
difficult to obtain specific dollar figures for the cost of drug
arrests and prosecutions in New York State, but by combining the
available data on caseloads and judicial costs it is possible to
make some rough estimates. In 1987, total arrests in New York
State were 481,676, whereas in 1991 the total was 506,710, an
increase of 5.2%. During the same period, felony drug arrests
rose from 42,655 (approximately 9% of total arrests) in 1987 to
54,184 in 1991 (11% of all arrests), a 27% increase. By contrast,
between 1987 and 1991, misdemeanor drug arrests dropped from
53,621 to 36,489, a decrease of 32%. In 1991 a tremendous volume
of caseload activity confronted the Judiciary's judges and
nonjudicial personnel. Nearly 79,000 felony indictments and
superior court informations were filed in Supreme and County
Courts throughout New York. That number represents a 54% increase
compared with 1985. Most of the statewide increase was the result
of phenomenal caseload increases in New York City. This year, the
Supreme Court Criminal Term in New York City received over 52,000
felony filings, an astonishing 70% increase since 1985. The
remarkable level in felony filings is primarily caused by
increases in drug-related filings. </p>

<p>. . . Unquestionably, these caseload increases are the product
of the drug crisis which, perhaps for the first time in our
State's history, threatens to test our ability to administer
justice on the local level, not just in New York City, but
statewide. </p>

<p>The increasing number of drug prosecutions in New York's
courts has taken its toll on the judicial system. One New York
State Supreme Court Justice has summarized the impact of the
so-called &quot;war on drugs&quot; on New York's criminal justice
system as follows: </p>

<p>Our court calendars groan under the burden of ever-increasing
new drug cases. New York City's Corrections Department estimates
that 70 percent of its inmates are charged with drug-related
crimes. Yet these ever-growing prosecutions and incarcerations
are having little or no impact on drug crimes. In 1980 only 11
percent of the total inmate population was incarcerated for drug
offenses, yet by 1992 this figure rose to 44 percent. At a cost
of $30,000 per year to maintain each prisoner, our state spent
over $195 million in 1992 to confine drug offenders alone. Last
year the state's Office of Court Administration requested an
additional $40 million just to cover the expense of drug cases.
Since the advent of crack a decade ago, the city has hired 9,000
new police, 700 additional assistant district attorneys, and has
added 18,000 new cells on Rikers Island. The total cost: $591
million a year. </p>

<h4>2. Other States </h4>

<p>State court convictions for drug law violations have increased
dramatically nationwide since the mid-1980s. Between 1986 and
1988, there was a nearly 70% increase in the number of persons
convicted of felony drug trafficking or possession charges (from
135,000 to 225,000). The number of persons convicted who received
state prison sentences rose from 49,900 to 92,500. In 1988, drug
offenses accounted for approximately one-third of all felony
convictions in all state courts. </p>

<h4>3. Federal Courts </h4>

<p>The case loads and concomitant costs of managing drug cases in
federal courts also have increased substantially over the past
decade. In 1982, the budget for prosecution of all federal drug
cases in the United States was $78.9 million; in 1993, the budget
was ten times as much -- $795.9 million. In federal district
courts in 1989, a total of 54,643 criminal cases were prosecuted;
of those 16,834 (approximately 30%) were for drug offenses. In
1990, 19,271 defendants were prosecuted for drug offenses; of
those 3,083 were not convicted, and 16,188 were convicted: 13,036
by guilty plea (81%), and 3,121 after trial (19%). Between July
1992 and June 1993, 50,366 defendants were convicted in the
federal courts, and 27% of these (18,576) were convicted of
federal drug offenses. Expenses associated with appeals of
federal drug cases rose from $8.2 million in 1982 to $104.2
million budgeted in 1993. A significant portion of this increase
resulted from appeals filings in drug-related cases, which
totalled 1,583 in 1981, 4,386 in 1989, and 5,658 in 1990 (a 29%
increase from the previous year alone and, overall, a 383%
increase in ten years). In 1991, there were 5,570 federal
drug-related appeals filed. </p>

<h4>4. The Judiciary is Impatient with the Present System </h4>

<p>Federal and state judges throughout the United States have
publicly expressed frustration with the present laws prohibiting
drugs, and some senior federal judges have even refused to sit on
drug cases. In the Southern District of New York and in the
Eastern District of New York, Judges Whitman Knapp, Robert Sweet,
and Jack Weinstein have spoken out publicly against the present
laws and their associated draconian penalties, and Judges Knapp
and Weinstein have refused, as is their right as senior judges,
to preside over drug trials and sentences. State judges in New
York have also protested the increasing time on their calendars
that drug cases take and the Second Offender sentencing rule that
compels them to give lengthy prison sentences to second-time drug
offenders. These judges seek a solution to the &quot;war on
drugs&quot; before the whole judicial system breaks down under
the strain. </p>

<h4>5. Efforts to Handle Court Congestion </h4>

<p>Because of the enormous increase in drug cases, especially in
large urban areas, several stop-gap solutions are being pursued
to balance limited court resources against the burgeoning
caseloads. In New York City and New Orleans, for instance,
special narcotics divisions have been established to expedite
processing of drug felonies. These experimental programs are
designed to hear cases just prior to grand jury proceedings with
the goal of inducing defendants to accept plea bargains that are
better than would be expected if the case proceeded through the
grand jury process. Also, special court parts -- staffed by
personnel with expertise in drug cases, addiction, and community
treatment centers -- have been established in New York City to
deal exclusively with drug cases. Unfortunately, none of these
short-term solutions will correct the fundamental distortion of
the priorities of the state and federal judicial systems caused
by the &quot;war on drugs.&quot; </p>

<h3>B. THE PRISON STATE </h3>

<p>One of the most tangible, measurable effects of the &quot;war
on drugs,&quot; has been the creation of a &quot;prison
state&quot;. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
statistics, one million arrests are made annually for violations
of the federal and state drug laws. As a result of these massive
numbers of arrests each year, &quot;the United States has a
higher proportion of its population incarcerated than any other
country in the world for which reliable statistics are
available.&quot; </p>

<p>Incarceration in America is now at an all-time high. From 1925
through 1973, the American prison population fluctuated between
90 and 120 people in prison per 100,000 of the population; in
1973 the rate was 98 per 100,000, a ten-year low. </p>

<p>Between 1973 and 1980, however, there was a 40% increase, to
135 people in prison per 100,000; and by 1986, following the
start of the modern &quot;war on drugs,&quot; the incarceration
rate had jumped to 200 per 100,000. In 1993, the rate of
Americans serving prison time stood at 325 per 100,000. In 1993,
the number of inmates in federal and state prisons in New York
increased by 4.6%, to 64,600. </p>

<p>On average, it costs $20,000 per year to maintain one
prisoner, $100,000 to build a single prison cell, and $20,000 per
year to staff a prison cell. </p>

<p>More than one in forty American males between the ages 14 and
34 are locked up. </p>

<p>Between 1980 and 1990, the total prison population in the
United States increased by 133% to over 771,000 prisoners. </p>

<p>In 1993, the total prison population reached 949,000, nearly
three times as many as in 1980. During the 1980s, new
imprisonments on drug charges increased over 1,000%. </p>

<p>Drug offenders have accounted for an increasing percentage of
the population in State and Federal correctional facilities. </p>

<p>Drug offenders constituted an estimated 22% of the State
prison population in 1991, up from 6% of the population in 1979.
In Federal correctional facilities, drug offenders accounted for
61% of the population, up from 16% in 1970, 25% in 1980, and 52%
in 1990. </p>

<p>The vast majority of the prison population increase during the
1980s, which doubled the number of persons under custody for all
charges, involved drug law violations. Due to the great increase
in drug-related incarcerations, the federal and state prison
systems are overwhelmed, as reported almost daily in the
newspapers. Prison overcrowding persists despite an unprecedented
boom in prison construction. For example, between 1983 and 1992,
New York State built 29 prisons, increasing the number of prisons
in the state to 68 and the inmate capacity from 29,253 to 57,862.
</p>

<p>No one wants overcrowding. It riles inmates, strains prison
guards, encourages the spread of illness and generally makes
prisons more volatile places. In the past, when there was money
to spend, the solution to overcrowding would have been clear --
create more space. Not any more. With money scarce and a sense
that more prison beds have not resulted in less crime, many
lawmakers are being forced to conclude they can no longer build
their way out of the problem. </p>

<p>According to the United States Department of Justice,
&quot;drug offenders&quot; are becoming a larger share of the
prison population for two reasons: first, the likelihood that a
conviction will result in incarceration is increasing; and
second, those convicted on drug charges are receiving longer
prison sentences. </p>

<p>Mandatory sentencing laws, such as the federal sentencing
guidelines, exacerbate the problem by forcing judges to impose
lengthy sentences for simple possession of small amounts of
drugs. These laws, first passed in the 1970s but increasingly
relied on as a weapon in the &quot;drug war&quot; in recent
years, have in large measure been responsible for today's severe
overcrowding. Mandatory minimum sentences require judges to
impose a statutorily-defined minimum period of incarceration
without the possibility of parole, with no consideration of the
specific facts of the crime or any mitigating circumstances.
Faced with mandatory sentences laws, there has been at a growing
movement at the state level to minimize their draconian effects.
In New York, for example, the courts had been cooperating with
prosecutors and defense attorneys to avoid the harsh effects on
second-time drug offenders. New York's Governor, Mario Cuomo, in
his 1994 budget message has asked the Legislature to restore
discretion to judges meting out second-time drug felony sentences
&quot;to relieve overcrowding in state prisons.&quot; </p>

<p>For all of the extra burden on the prison and judicial systems
and on the taxpayer caused by the &quot;war on drugs,&quot;
American society has little to show for it. &quot;If such
toughness had much to do with crime, you'd think we'd have seen
some results by now. But . . . overall crime has decreased only
6% since 1973; violent crimes are up 24%. The National Research
Council of the National Academy of Sciences recently concluded
that a tripling of time served by violent offenders since 1975
had `apparently very little' impact on violent crime.&quot; With
61% of today's federal inmates incarcerated on drug law
convictions, judiciary and corrections overcrowding and escalated
costs would necessarily be reduced were the current drug policy
altered toward a less punitive, more humane approach which
removes the profit motive fueling the black market in illegal
drugs. </p>

<h3>C. EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL LIBERTIES </h3>

<p>One of the more insidious effects of the &quot;war on
drugs&quot; has been the gradual erosion of the rule of law and
the public's civil liberties. Several interrelated elements
contribute to this particularly destructive consequence of the
current drug laws. </p>

<h4>1. Perception of Ineffectiveness </h4>

<p>Politicians from the President of the United States to mayors
running in local elections are importuned by the people for the
assurance that increasing crime and the criminal element be
contained in our society. Our country, with the highest rate of
drug abuse of any industrial country in the world, also has the
largest budget in the world to enforce its laws prohibiting
drugs. Despite huge increases in the federal government's budget
for the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; the so-called &quot;drug
problem&quot; with all of its ramifications, has not
significantly abated. The public's perception of its political
leaders' ineffectiveness in alleviating drug-related violence
adds to the general atmosphere of lawlessness and breeds cynicism
and disrespect for the law. Instead of progress since the first
federal anti-drug law was passed in 1914, nearly 80 years of drug
prohibition have yielded few inroads against the sale or use of
drugs. This, understandably, suggests to the public that the law
itself is an ineffectual tool for dealing with the issue. </p>

<h4>2. Perception of a Self-Perpetuating System </h4>

<p>The large sums of money appropriated for law-enforcement
create enormous, self-perpetuating bureaucratic agencies, such as
the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (&quot;DEA&quot;),
which fight for independence and scarce public resources while
making little headway against the &quot;drug problem.&quot; These
agencies have ample motivation to exaggerate or distort the
extent and danger of &quot;drug abuse&quot; so as to justify (and
thereby insure) their continued existence. Being inherently
biased, they have great potential to ignore the public's true
welfare. </p>

<h4>3. Police Corruption </h4>

<p>The fact that drug prohibition breeds corruption has been
known for decades. Every day there are news stories of law
enforcement officers being arrested for their involvement with
drug dealers. The sums of money involved in the drug business are
too great and too inviting for the law enforcers not to seek
their share. Corrupt police behavior creates a further
disillusioned public. In addition, just as organized crime became
entrenched during Prohibition, the current prohibitionist regime
is currently subsidizing the mafia and other organized crime
groups because of the highly inflated prices on the black market.
</p>

<h4>4. Poor Children are Victims of the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; </h4>

<p>There is no reason to believe that recognized market forces
cease to apply where the drug business is concerned. There is
public recognition that youths and unemployed adults often cannot
just say &quot;no&quot; to drugs when saying &quot;yes&quot; as a
dealer or a dealer's helper is much more profitable than are the
alternatives. Children living in poor, urban neighborhoods are
particularly susceptible to being drawn into illegal drug-related
activities by visions of status and easy money. Laws against
drugs thus discourage many youths and adults from productive
legitimate employment that would benefit society. </p>

<h4>5. Selective Prosecution </h4>

<p>Criminal prosecutions for violations of the federal and state
drug laws appear to be disproportionately directed against
minorities. Understandably, there is widespread public concern
that the drug laws are selectively enforced with vigor against
the poor and disenfranchised, while rich and middle class drug
users are permitted to indulge without serious fear of legal
consequences. </p>

<h4>6. Erosion of Constitutional Rights </h4>

<p>The pursuit of a &quot;drug-free&quot; society has resulted in
a panoply of intrusions into the lives of United States citizens:
The Bill of Rights is in danger of becoming meaningless in cases
involving drugs. Tenants charged with no crime are evicted from
homes where police believe drugs are being sold. Public housing
projects are sealed for house-to-house inspections. The Supreme
Court has permitted warrantless searches of automobiles, the use
of anonymous tips and drug-courier profiles as the basis for
police searches, and the seizure of lawyers' fees in drug cases.
Property on which marijuana plants are found can be forfeited
even if the owner is charged with no crime. Prosecutors have been
allowed to try the same person at the state and federal levels
for the same drug-related crime. </p>

<p>A few examples will illustrate the erosion in individual civil
liberties occasioned by the &quot;war on drugs.&quot; In 1991,
the United States Supreme Court in Florida v. Bostick, upheld the
constitutionality of a police tactic of boarding long- distance
buses and asking permission to search passengers' baggage,
overruling the Florida Supreme Court's ruling that such an
encounter with the police is so inherently coercive that no
consent given for such a search could be truly voluntary. The
Florida v. Bostick decision was merely one of a number of rulings
since the early 1980s which authorized police stops and
questioning of airline, train, and bus passengers without the
level of suspicion generally required for Fourth Amendment search
and seizure purposes. </p>

<p>The search for tell-tale evidence of drug use has even
descended to the level of compelling federal employees to give
urine samples for analysis, without regard to whether such a
privacy intrusion is related to job performance. The public --
led by the government -- appears to be willing to jump on the
bandwagon &quot;to restrict civil liberties, and even accept
warrantless searches of homes and cars, in order to reduce the
use of illicit drugs.&quot; </p>

<h4>7. Forfeiture's Heavy Hand </h4>

<p>Forfeiture has become one of the most publicized and
controversial weapons in the government's anti-drug arsenal. Any
assumption, however, that the law would be deployed only against
&quot;drug kingpins&quot; and major players has proved
unwarranted as small time dealers and marginal users are more
often targeted: Under Zero Tolerance, which targets casual drug
users, the government has seized thousands of cars, boats, and
homes because occupants or guests allegedly carried drugs. In
1990, seizures exceeded $527 million, and they are expected to
exceed $700 million in 1991. The U.S. Marshalls Services now has
a $1.4 billion inventory of seized assets including more than
30,000 homes, cars, businesses and other property. </p>

<p>In the fiscal year 1993, &quot;the DEA made 14,430 domestic
seizures of nondrug property, valued at approximately $669
million.&quot; Moreover, forfeitures have become a popular way to
generate additional revenue. </p>

<p>The in rem nature of a civil forfeiture proceeding, replete
with its many procedural pitfalls, rests on the legal fiction
that the property itself is guilty of wrongdoing. The uneven
burdens of proof assigned the parties reveals the imbalance in
the system. To prevail, the government need only have reasonable
grounds to believe the property is subject to forfeiture. It
falls to the claimant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the negative proposition that the property was
&quot;innocent.&quot; As a result of the over-zealous application
of the forfeiture statutes, the judiciary has attempted to curb
some of the more visible excesses. For instance, absent exigent
circumstances, pre-hearing seizures of homes, where the tenants
were either evicted outright or were permitted to stay at the
sufferance of the United States Marshall, are no longer
tolerated. And the forfeiture of real property is now expressly
subject to the limitations of Eighth Amendment proportionality
analysis. </p>

<p>A claimant's ability to defend against a forfeiture has long
been compromised by the maze of rules allowing for the freezing
of assets, which alone often discourages private counsel from
taking on a case. Too often, the failure to secure experienced
counsel results in the loss of the property. Finally, with news
accounts of law enforcement personnel driving around in expensive
cars seized during drug operations, reports of police helicopters
with sophisticated detection equipment hovering over homes, and
the intrusive subpoenaing of records from bona fide businesses
(such as those offering hydroponic gardening equipment), it is
clear that forfeiture laws require an overhaul. </p>

<h4>8. Erosion of Privacy Rights </h4>

<p>Although the Ninth Amendment guarantees that &quot;[t]he
enumeration in the Constitution of rights shall not be construed
to deny or disparage others retained by the people,&quot; our
society has struggled to find a balance between individual
liberty and privacy and governmental intrusion. Although the
United States Supreme Court has recognized certain activities as
being beyond the reach of most state or federal governmental
intrusion (e.g., birth control, abortion during the first
trimester, and the possession of adult pornography in the home),
drug use has never been found to be within the &quot;right of
privacy&quot; that the Court has forged. Because the law, as it
stands today, does not recognize the right to use drugs, the
&quot;war on drugs&quot; has become &quot;in effect, if not in
intention, a war on drug users.&quot; Year after year, state and
federal laws that prohibit the possession of drugs, demonize and
criminalize the users of drugs, estimated to be at least 20
million in the United States alone. Yet, &quot;[d]rugs have been
used to alter consciousness in most societies throughout history,
and different drugs have been considered acceptable at different
times and places.&quot; As Lester Grinspoon and James B. Bakalar
have stated: </p>

<p>Of all the Prohibition era mistakes we are now repeating, the
most serious is trying to free society of drugs by the use of
force. There is no reason to believe that the inclination to
ingest substances that alter consciousness can be eradicated. A
drug-free society is an impossible and probably an undesirable
dream. . . . Our present drug policies are immoral because they
require a war of annihilation against a wrongly chosen enemy. We
will never be able to regulate the use of consciousness-altering
drugs effectively until our ends are changed along with the means
that serve them. </p>

<p>Ending drug prohibition would enable the Court and our society
to recognize the right of individuals to alter their
consciousness (the most private of matters), so long as they do
not harm the persons or property of others. </p>

<h3>D. PROHIBITION-INDUCED VIOLENCE </h3>

<p>In New York and elsewhere in the United States, wild shootouts
in urban areas are frequently publicized. These reports reveal
that innocent bystanders in these areas are often caught in the
cross-fire. It is, however, far from clear that the use of or
need for prohibited drugs causes this sort of violent crime.
Rather, the available evidence tends to support the conclusion
that it is the prohibitionist laws against drugs that cause the
violent crimes that people generally deplore. </p>

<p>So-called &quot;drug-related crime&quot; is often related only
indirectly to the drugs themselves, resulting instead from the
illegal black market in drugs that is, in turn, spawned by laws
prohibiting the legal sale of drugs. For example, the Los Angeles
police have long known that the lucrative black market in cocaine
has provided the incentive (as well as the financing) for the
bloody gang turf wars in that city. Similarly, it is estimated
that 40% of the homicides in a study of 414 homicides in New York
City precincts were indirectly attributable to black market
trafficking in drugs. Further supporting the fact that it is drug
prohibition rather than drug use which is causing the alarming
&quot;drug-related&quot; violence saturating our culture is the
historical precedent of alcohol Prohibition which was accompanied
by the same type of violence. </p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that black markets would not
disappear with the ending of drug prohibition. Common sense
indicates that without the immense profits guaranteed by the
necessarily restricted nature of the outlets, there would be
little advantage to maintaining such black markets. The current
patterns of drug-sale related turf violence would be
substantially, if not wholly, undermined. </p>

<h3>E. PROHIBITION'S FAILURE TO LIMIT DRUG USE </h3>

<p>Proponents of the &quot;war on drugs&quot; often eagerly
declare that the draconian prohibitionist laws of the state and
federal government are causing a decline in drug use. The
evidence, however, tends to show that &quot;the number of heavy
drug users in the United States is undiminished.&quot; In
addition, recent surveys show an increasing number of high school
students using marijuana and lysergic acid diethylamide
(&quot;LSD&quot;). Even proponents of the &quot;war on
drugs&quot; candidly admit that &quot;drug abuse cannot be
entirely eliminated.&quot; Some experts have estimated that the
government has spent close to $500 billion dollars over the past
20 years to enforce the prohibitionist laws against drugs, while
during the same period use levels rose and the number of arrests
and the amounts of drugs seized increased unabated annually.
750,000 people were incarcerated for violating the prohibitionist
drug laws during a twenty-year period, costing an average of $25
billion annually and $61 billion for 1991 alone. </p>

<p>Although the vast majority of Americans polled stated that
they would not take now-prohibited drugs if they were legalized,
many people voice the concern that use would escalate sharply
upon legalization. Implicit in the idea that use of drugs would
rise upon legalization is the assumption that the current
prohibitionist laws discourage many people from using them. The
available evidence tends to show that Americans can and do
voluntarily control their use of drugs. </p>

<p>The recent decline in middle class use of drugs as well as
recent declines in alcohol and tobacco consumption have been
attributed by many experts to factors (such as education, health
and fitness awareness, and social pressures) other than the
prohibitionist laws against drugs. Experts have recognized these
other factors as the basis for the current levels of use of drugs
(including alcohol and tobacco) rather than the existence of
prohibitionist laws. Indeed some observers have cited the
prohibitionist laws against drugs as a significant factor leading
to increased use and greater numbers of addicts than we would
otherwise have: [T]he growth of addiction over the last four
decades in the US had little to do with price reductions or, for
that matter, with the growth of real income. The crucial factor
in the spread of the drug habit has been the unrelenting pressure
exerted by legions of street pushers in the continuing endeavor
to widen the circle of the customers. In other words, the crucial
factor in spreading the drug habit has been the super profits
made possible only by governments' illegalization of the
trade.&quot; </p>

<p>It is impossible to prove the levels of post- legalization use
of now-prohibited drugs, but reasonable extrapolations may be
made by referring to similar experiences in this country and
abroad. </p>

<p>Prohibition of alcohol in the United States earlier in this
century is a basis for comparison, albeit an imperfect one. A
review of alcohol consumption patterns during and after
Prohibition shows that during most of the Prohibition era per
capita alcohol consumption actually increased. After
&quot;Prohibition's repeal in 1933, consumption remained fairly
stable until after the Second World War when, without any change
in public policy, it began increasing.&quot; The prohibitionist
laws, therefore, seem to have little impact on an individual's
decision whether to use drugs. Another useful example is the
experience of the ten states that decriminalized the possession
of small amounts of marijuana for personal consumption in the
1970s. There was no increase in the level of marijuana use in
those states. Indeed marijuana consumption declined in those
states just as it did in states that retained criminal sanctions
against marijuana. In 1976, the Dutch decriminalized marijuana
consumption, although possession and small sales technically
remained illegal. The level of use actually declined after
decriminalization. Indeed marijuana use in the Netherlands is
substantially lower than in countries waging a &quot;war on
drugs,&quot; including the United States and, at least until
recently, Germany. Among Dutch youths aged 17-18, only 17.7% used
marijuana at least once in their lifetimes, as opposed to 43.7%
of Americans. Only 4.6% of the Dutch had used marijuana at least
once in the past month, as opposed to 16.7% of the Americans. </p>

<p>While indicating clearly that prohibitionist laws do not
prevent the use of drugs, these statistics also tend to show that
legalizing now-prohibited drugs, at least marijuana, does not
inevitably cause an increase in use. Under an exception to the
British prohibitionist system, doctors may provide prohibited
drugs to addicts. Dr. John Marks of Liverpool commenced such a
program in 1982, and, to his astonishment, he noted that the
number of new addicts decreased in Liverpool while in a nearby
town operating under prohibition the rate of new addicts was
twelve-fold higher. Dr. Marks attributed the decline in the
number of new addicts to the fact that addicts received their
needed drugs from his program for pennies, thus there was no
longer any need for addicts to bring in new customers to raise
enough money to support their habits. Others addressing the issue
of whether the levels of use of now prohibited drugs would
escalate to overwhelming proportions after legalization (as many
prohibitionists have predicted) have likened possible patterns of
illegal drug use to patterns of alcohol use, with which we have a
solid familiarity. They point out that Western cultures have
handled alcohol consumption with tolerable skill for centuries
and point out that most of the American population that drinks
occasionally, or even every day, exercises moderation. </p>

<p>Indeed the available data indicate that the vast majority of
the American population that uses now-prohibited drugs does so
with moderation. According to United States government
statistics, more than 75 million persons in the United States
household population have used prohibited drugs. The National
Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that close to 40 million
Americans continue to consume these substances. Yet, only a
comparatively minuscule number of deaths due to drug overdoses,
4,242, occurred in 1991 according to medical examiner data
compiled by the Drug Abuse Warning Network. Once the distinction
between use of prohibited drugs and abuse is acknowledged, the
available statistics show that the vast majority of Americans who
use drugs do not abuse them. </p>

<p>Based on our experience with American states' and foreign
decriminalization of marijuana, it appears that decriminalization
does not lead to greater levels of use nor to abuse. Likewise
there is evidence to support the proposition that the
decriminalization of the so-called &quot;hard drugs&quot; does
not lead to increased rates of addiction. Perhaps most
importantly, data analysis strongly indicates that social factors
wholly apart from the criminalization of drugs account in the
greatest measure for reduced rates of use. Based on the evidence,
it would not be unfair to say that the predicted,
post-legalization explosion in the use of drugs has been greatly
overstated and that use in continued moderation would be the much
more likely result. European countries, such as the Netherlands,
have benefitted from an approach to drugs that focuses on
&quot;harm reduction&quot; rather than draconian measures to
enforce prohibition. </p>

<h3>F. PROHIBITION THREATENS PUBLIC HEALTH </h3>

<h4>1. Spread of Disease </h4>

<h5>a. Sharing Needles </h5>

<p>Because the possession of hypodermic needles is generally
illegal, users of injectable drugs routinely share needles and
syringes with one another, often in &quot;shooting
galleries&quot; where dozens of addicts may line up to use a
single needle rented out by the dealers and not sterilized
between uses. This sharing of needles has become a major source
of transmission of blood-borne diseases such as acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (&quot;AIDS&quot;) and hepatitis. According
to a recent national review, &quot;more than 33% of new AIDS
cases occur among injecting drug users or people having sexual
contact with them.&quot; In New York State, the majority of new
AIDS cases since 1988 have been reported among users of
injectable drugs and their sexual partners. Both the Centers for
Disease Control and the New York State Department of Health have
estimated that more than 75% of pediatric AIDS cases are children
whose mothers either injected drugs or were the sexual partners
of persons who injected drugs. The data suggest, at the very
least, that sterile hypodermic needles should be readily and
freely available to drug users. So long as drug use remains
unlawful, however, free needle distribution is not likely to
attract a substantial portion of the user population. In
response, some courts have circumscribed laws dealing with the
unlawful possession of hypodermic needles by applying defenses of
medical necessity. </p>

<h5>b. Trading Sex for Drugs </h5>

<p>Because illicit drugs are expensive, many addicts turn to
prostitution to make money to support their habits, or exchange
sexual services directly for drugs. Prostitute drug addicts often
do not protect themselves from contracting sexually transmitted
diseases carried by their customers, and they pass such diseases
on to other customers, their lovers, and their children. The
crack epidemic, in particular, has been blamed for the recently
noted resurgence of syphilis and other sexually transmitted
diseases. </p>

<p>Dr. Robert Rolfs of the Centers for Disease Control placed the
blame squarely on cocaine and its high cost: People -- especially
women -- have high-risk sex and practice prostitution to support
their habits. And it is occurring in a relatively poor population
where people have a lot of things that prevent their access to
treatment. Therefore, they stay infected longer and are more
likely to pass their infections on to others. Fewer addicts would
be forced to resort to prostitution if the current prohibitions
against drugs were lifted. </p>

<h5>c. Neglect of Health </h5>

<p>Because of addicts' preoccupation with obtaining and using
drugs, and the debilitating effects of some of the drugs
themselves, many addicts are in very poor health. Malnutrition is
a frequent problem and, in turn, contributes to many others.
Addicts' poor health makes them especially susceptible to
diseases ranging from scurvy and shingles to tuberculosis and the
flu. Addicts are also more likely to contract communicable
diseases and therefore more likely to spread them. The
interrelated urban problems of homelessness and illegal drug
abuse have contributed to the development of multi-drug-resistant
strains of diseases such as tuberculosis, which was once thought
to be on the verge of eradication. These more virulent diseases
know few geographical limitations and pose risks to the general
population. </p>

<h5>d. Avoidance of the Health-Care System </h5>

<p>Individuals who use illegal drugs often put off addressing
their health problems for fear of prosecution or other adverse
consequences (e.g., rebuffs by doctors, loss of job). This
reluctance to seek medical care is compounded by the fact that
many drug addicts have no private physicians and rely instead on
public hospitals or clinics for any care they might get.
Prohibition, therefore, has perverse results on health; drug
abusers tend to enter the health-care system only if and when
their need for care is acute, which is also when care is most
costly to deliver. If, for example, a woman avoids pre-natal
care, she may give birth to a baby with low birth weight and
other medical difficulties. If a drug abuser puts off seeking
treatment for illnesses and injuries, he or she may end up in the
emergency room and the intensive care ward. Mothers and pregnant
women face the additional and justifiable fear that any
detectable drug use may be reported as a possible indication of
child abuse or neglect. In many large city hospitals, the urine
of newborn babies is tested for prohibited drugs, and mothers
whose babies test positive for pre-natal exposure are reported to
the child abuse authorities. </p>

<p>Until recently, in New York City, such babies were routinely
kept from their mothers pending investigations that often lasted
many months, interfering with normal bonding and necessarily
adversely affecting the infant's development and relationship
with the parent. Moreover, these women have, in some
jurisdictions, been prosecuted for pre-partum distribution of
prohibited drugs. </p>

<p>In addition to the obvious costs to the individuals who become
infected with catastrophic illnesses directly through drug use,
and the high costs to the health care system of treating them,
prohibition contributes to the spread of such diseases throughout
society, particularly to the sexual partners and children of
infected drug users. Left untreated, users and addicts are more
likely to give birth to unhealthy children, to abuse or neglect
their children after they are born, or to have their children
placed in foster care. </p>

<h4>2. Lack of Information and Quality Control </h4>

<h5>a. Adulterated Drugs, Designer Drugs, and Drugs of Unknown
Potency </h5>

<p>Because drugs are manufactured and distributed in secret, it
is impossible for users to guard against adulteration or to
determine the purity and potency of the drugs they use. The
problem is compounded by drug growers, manufacturers, and
distributors who, to minimize the risks of apprehension, develop
and purvey the drug varieties that pack the most intoxicating
effect into the smallest package. According to an experienced New
York City researcher, The fact that cocaine, heroin and related
drugs are illegal encourages the use of injection. Severe
statutory restrictions greatly increase the cost of illicit
substances to nonmedical users. Injecting provides a way to
economize. Injectable forms of opiates and coca are much more
concentrated than traditional forms, such as opium or coca tea.
Injection provides an intense and economical effect by maximizing
the amount of drug that reaches the brain. People who sniff or
smoke drugs say that if they inject they need only one third of
the amount of the drug to maintain a habit. </p>

<p>Because the injection forms of illicit drugs are concentrated,
they are [also] relatively easier to ship. It has been
demonstrated that, as law enforcement and criminal penalties
intensify, dealers also find other ways to economize by inventing
new drugs -- so-called &quot;designer drugs&quot; -- that are not
yet prohibited. This places the ill-informed consumers of such
drugs at greater risk of overdose and other health problems.
Illnesses and deaths have resulted from (1) the introduction of
dangerous substances into drugs that could otherwise have been
used with greater safety, (2) inadvertent overdoses due to
variations in potency, and (3) the development of &quot;designer
drugs&quot; intended to give the effect of familiar intoxicants
with new chemical compositions that put them beyond the reach of
current laws. Just as the prohibition against alcohol led to
sales of poisonous wood alcohol and the prohibition against
abortion led to coat-hanger abortions, the prohibition against
drug manufacture, sale, and possession results in unnecessary
deaths due to adulteration, variable purity, and &quot;designer
drugs.&quot; This contrasts sharply with the government's current
regulation of alcoholic beverages, which ensures that the
beverages are pure and that buyers know how strong they are and
what some of their health effects may be. </p>

<p>Experts have noted that heightened efforts to enforce drug
laws and amend them to encompass new formulations or ban
precursor substances may only push dealers to take greater risks,
selling ever more potentially dangerous substances. </p>

<h5>b. Lack of Knowledge About Safer Use </h5>

<p>Because many drugs are outlawed, individuals considering drug
use rarely have access to accurate information about the effects
of drugs. While a cautious user may err on the side of avoiding
certain activities while under the use of drugs, he or she may
have no way of knowing, beyond trial and error, the possible
adverse health consequences of certain combinations of drugs and
his or her individual tolerance for particular substances.
Because of its penchant for exaggeration and cartoonish treatment
of the issues, most current education about drugs is not taken
seriously by young people. As a result, it is far less effective
than other health education (e.g., about nutrition, fitness, and
smoking cigarettes). </p>

<h5>c. Using Alcohol and Tobacco Instead of &quot;Soft
Drugs&quot; </h5>

<p>Alcohol and tobacco are completely legal yet do much more
harm, statistically speaking, than illegal drug use. It is also
generally recognized that alcohol, at least when used to excess,
can cause aggressive, anti-social behavior. The current
prohibitionist laws against marijuana, generally considered an
&quot;a-motivational&quot; drug, and other so-called &quot;soft
drugs&quot; have the effect of influencing some people to choose
alcohol over these &quot;soft drugs.&quot; Peter Reuter, an
economist at the Rand Corporation, concludes that &quot;If
marijuana is a substitute for alcohol . . . , alcohol is, by
definition, a substitute for marijuana. Thus tough marijuana
enforcement must increase drinking.&quot; Similarly, Frank
Chaloupka, an economist at the University of Illinois, found
through statistical analysis &quot;that states without criminal
sanctions against marijuana possession suffered fewer auto
fatalities.&quot; Finally, Karen Model, a Ph.D. candidate at
Harvard, found that &quot;states decriminalizing marijuana
reported lower overall rates of drug- and alcohol-related
emergencies.&quot; To the extent that users are choosing alcohol
rather than marijuana or other &quot;soft drugs,&quot; the
overall public health effects are probably worse than they would
be otherwise. </p>

<h4>3. Injuries Due to Violence </h4>

<p>The high prices commanded by prohibited drugs create
competition among groups and individuals willing to break the law
to supply drugs to consumers. Their competition often becomes
violent and has contributed to the build-up of arms and the
pervasiveness of violence in many areas. Gunshot wounds and other
traumas due to the illegal drug business have become commonplace
in big-city hospital emergency rooms. Not only traffickers, but
also law enforcement officers and innocent bystanders are often
the victims. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently noted: </p>

<p>The victims of the[] gun battles [of street-level drug
dealers] are innocent bystanders -- and often young children.
Last year alone, about 500 New York City children were shot; of
these, 89 were innocent bystanders hit by crossfire. The cost of
prohibiting drugs must be measured in terms of lost lives and
expensive medical care and include the hidden costs of lost
productivity and the psychological damage to individuals and
entire communities living in fear, helpless and hopeless. </p>

<p>With the possible exceptions of cocaine and PCP, drugs
themselves do not generally cause violent behavior. It is,
instead, turf wars for the control of black markets and the drug
users' need for money to purchase such substances that leads to
violence. Indeed, marijuana and heroin have been shown to render
their users disinclined to violence or incapable of violence
while under the influence. These substances are much less
dangerous in this regard than alcohol. </p>

<h4>4. Diversion of Resources from Treatment and Prevention </h4>

<p>Prohibition diverts money that could otherwise be used for
preventing and treating drug abuse. Federal anti-drug legislation
provides a single budget for &quot;supply reduction&quot; and
&quot;demand reduction&quot; efforts. Law enforcement agencies
have always received much more than prevention, treatment, and
research programs combined. The ABA recently reported that
&quot;[s]ince the early 1980s, treatment has been a declining
priority. In 1991, treatment received 14% of the $10.5 billion
federal drug budget compared to 25% ten years earlier.&quot;
During the same period, &quot;federal spending on law enforcement
increased 737%, with interdiction efforts leading the
increase.&quot; Ending drug prohibition would, by definition,
eliminate the need for any special law enforcement funds for drug
interdiction. It would also allow for the redirection of law
enforcement resources to concentrate on violent crime and quality
of life issues. </p>

<h4>5. The Sense of Treating Drugs as a Public Health Problem </h4>

<h5>a. Treatment Works </h5>

<p>The vast majority of resources in the United States available
to meet this country's &quot;drug problem&quot; have been
utilized for interdiction rather than education and treatment.
This allocation of resources has skewed the public's perception
of the problem, which is seen largely as one of law enforcement.
However, drug abuse and drug addiction are fundamentally a public
health problem. </p>

<p>Reallocation of resources away from interdiction and into
education and treatment is essential to the successful management
of this problem. Drug abuse and drug addiction are health
problems that can be treated. Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, former
Deputy Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
now Medical Director of the Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse and lecturer in psychiatry at Columbia University College
of Physicians and Surgeons, has identified a basic fallacy
responsible for the predominant pessimistic outlook: </p>

<p>Drug dependence has been viewed as a chronic relapsing illness
with an unfavorable prognosis. However, there are thousands of
formerly dependent individuals in the United States and elsewhere
who have remained off both illicit drugs and excess use of licit
drugs like alcohol for decades, functioning as productive
citizens . . . . [T]here are already effective methods of
treatment if the right approach [and] the right person can be
brought together. </p>

<p>No one should conclude that treatment is not effective just
because drug abuse, like alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking,
often cannot be &quot;cured&quot; with a single treatment effort.
Most people who do conquer drug addiction succeed only after
multiple efforts and relapses. Because effective treatment
depends on finding the best method of helping a particular person
at a particular time, several attempts may be needed to discover
what will work. </p>

<h5>b. Self-Help Groups </h5>

<p>Some substance abusers manage their problem with the help of
Alcoholics Anonymous (&quot;AA&quot;), Narcotics Anonymous
(&quot;NA&quot;) or similar groups. These voluntary self-help
associations offer the structure of a program following
&quot;twelve steps&quot; to sobriety and the support of fellow
abusers in different stages of recovery. Since these groups
maintain members' confidentiality and do not keep records of
attendance at meetings, their success has not been measured
statistically; however, anecdotal evidence of their effectiveness
is strong. Additionally, many respected treatment programs rely
on methods developed by the self-help groups and prescribe
attendance at AA and NA meetings for their patients. </p>

<h5>c. Therapeutic Communities </h5>

<p>One of the best-known methods of professional treatment for
drug abuse is a highly structured, long-term residential
inpatient program known as a therapeutic community. The Committee
visited three therapeutic community facilities in New York City
-- programs operated by Daytop Village, Project Return and
Phoenix House. Patients in therapeutic communities generally
spend one to two years, sometimes more, living and working in the
facility. Through individual counseling and group therapy, the
patients address the causes and effects of their substance abuse
and other problems and attempt to rebuild their lives free of
drugs. Education, vocational training and work experience are
important components of the treatment, because therapeutic
community patients frequently lack necessary skills for making
their own way in society. Successful patients gradually re-enter
the outside world, first obtaining jobs and ultimately moving to
homes outside the program. While many patients drop out of these
challenging and restrictive programs, research has shown that
three-quarters of the patients who stay for the prescribed course
of treatment remained drug-free seven years later. One study
found that 56% of the individuals entering residential treatment
(including those who dropped out) no longer used heroin or
cocaine one year later. By the end of the study, more than 80% of
the patients no longer used any prohibited drug other than
marijuana. Another different national study that focused on
opiate addicts revealed that nearly three quarters (74%) of the
addicts who entered therapeutic communities were not using
opiates regularly (i.e., on a daily basis) three years later. </p>

<h5>d. Other Inpatient Drug-Free Treatment Programs </h5>

<p>Substance abusers with health insurance or other means of
payment often seek residential treatment in less restrictive
settings and for shorter periods of time. Two of the best-known
programs providing this sort of inpatient treatment are the Betty
Ford Center in Palm Springs, California, and the Hazelden program
in Minnesota. Patients usually participate in intensive
individual counseling, group therapy, and AA or NA meetings.
Patients most commonly stay for four weeks and are then
discharged to &quot;aftercare&quot; programs for continuing
outpatient treatment or are advised to seek AA or NA meetings in
the community. Many prominent citizens have testified publicly to
the efficacy and value of these sorts of treatment programs. </p>

<h5>e. Outpatient Methadone Maintenance Programs </h5>

<p>Methadone maintenance is the most widely used treatment for
narcotics addiction in the United States. Drs. Vincent P. Dole
and Marie Nyswander developed the treatment at Rockefeller
University in the early 1960s. Heroin addicts who are medicated
with an appropriate daily dose of methadone, a long-acting
synthetic opiate, lose the desire to use heroin but do not
experience either withdrawal symptoms or the euphoric or
impairing effects of narcotic use. Methadone patients can
function normally and perform successfully in the workplace in
jobs ranging from attorney to architect to bus driver. </p>

<p>In the early stages of treatment, methadone patients visit the
program daily to receive their doses. They are granted more
flexible schedules as they show progress in treatment by
remaining free of other drugs, maintaining steady employment, and
making progress in other areas. Methadone programs also provide
counseling and other health care and usually arrange for
vocational rehabilitation, education, and other services. </p>

<p>Successful methadone patients may remain in treatment for many
years, often at reduced doses; and some eventually leave
treatment entirely. </p>

<p>A high proportion of methadone patients stay in treatment
(more than two-thirds, by many reports), and more than 85% of
those remaining in treatment for a year never use heroin again. A
substantial proportion also stop using alcohol and other drugs.
The results of research assessing the effectiveness of methadone
maintenance have been strikingly consistent. One major study
found that, within a year of beginning treatment, 70% of those
who had entered methadone treatment were no longer using heroin.
After three years, use by patients who had remained with the
program for at least three months had declined by almost 85%.
Another study examining AIDS infection among injection drug users
found that methadone maintenance treatment effectively reduced
intravenous drug use by 71%. An earlier study had found that more
than three quarters of the patients who entered methadone
maintenance treatment were still not regularly using opiates
three years later. </p>

<h5>f. Outpatient Drug-Free Therapy </h5>

<p>Substance abusers who cannot commit themselves to inpatient
treatment and do not want methadone treatment (or would not
benefit from it because their primary drug of abuse is not
heroin) can participate in a variety of outpatient drug-free
therapies, including the full range of &quot;talk&quot;
therapies, supervised twelve-step programs, and programs that use
acupuncture to reduce the craving for drugs. Outpatient programs
often are recommended as follow-ups to short-term hospital-based
&quot;detoxification&quot; programs, which generally are
effective only for short-term crisis intervention purposes. </p>

<p>The Committee visited the Lincoln Hospital Substance Abuse
Division in New York City, which has been treating drug abuse
patients with acupuncture for more than 15 years. </p>

<p>Acupuncture treatment, which involves the insertion of five
needles in the outer ear while the patients sit quietly in a
common room for 30 to 45 minutes, is meant to control withdrawal
symptoms and the craving for drugs and to have a general calming
effect. At Lincoln Hospital it is used in combination with group
counseling on the Narcotics Anonymous model, as well as
urinalysis monitoring. Like methadone treatment, acupuncture
begins as a daily treatment, with successful patients
&quot;graduating&quot; to less frequent schedules. Outpatient
drug-free treatment programs, whether they employ acupuncture or
not, differ in the nature, length and frequency of treatment
sessions. </p>

<p>The usefulness of acupuncture treatment for substance abuse
has been demonstrated in several studies. Outpatient programs,
generally, have demonstrated a fair amount of success in treating
substance abusers. One national study found that nearly
three-quarters of the patients who entered outpatient drug-free
programs for opiate abuse were not using opiates regularly three
years later. A later study of similar scope revealed that, after
a year in treatment, 42% of the regular cocaine users who stayed
in outpatient drug-free treatment for at least three months had
stopped using cocaine completely. Over three to five years,
regular heroin use by patients who had received treatment for at
least three months fell by half, and fewer than 20% of the
patients who stayed in treatment for at least three months were
regular users of any prohibited drug except marijuana. </p>

<h4>6. Empirical Research on Effective Drug Treatment </h4>

<p>Virtually all studies conducted over the last 20 years show
that the most commonly practiced methods of treatment do work.
Treatment has been shown to reduce substance abuse and ameliorate
its consequences. The outcome of treatment has not been found to
differ significantly with the type of treatment received.
Methadone programs, inpatient residential programs, and
outpatient drug-free programs all show dramatic results. </p>

<h5>a. Studies Examining the Effects of Treatment on Substance
Use </h5>

<p>The most comprehensive study of the effectiveness of drug
treatment, the Treatment Outcomes Prospective Survey
(&quot;TOPS&quot;) funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(&quot;NIDA&quot;), strongly confirmed the efficacy of treatment
in reducing drug use. For up to five years after their treatment,
TOPS followed 10,000 substance abusers who had been admitted to
37 different treatment programs across the country. The programs
included residential and outpatient drug-free programs and
outpatient methadone maintenance programs. Heroin and cocaine use
declined significantly for patients in all treatment modalities.
After a year in treatment, heroin use by patients in methadone
maintenance programs declined by 70%, while 75% of outpatient
drug-free patients and 56% of residential treatment patients had
stopped using heroin or cocaine. By the end of the study, fewer
than 20% of the patients regularly used any illegal drug except
marijuana, and 40% to 50% of the patients abstained altogether. </p>

<p>Other studies have reached virtually identical conclusions. A
study sponsored by NIDA to address the risk of AIDS infection for
injection drug users found that methadone maintenance treatment
effectively reduced intravenous drug use by 71% among those who
remained in the program for one year. An earlier NIDA study based
on the Drug Abuse Report Program (&quot;DARP&quot;) tracked the
drug use of 44,000 opiate addicts admitted to treatment between
1969 and 1974. The study found that most patients stopped using
opiates daily and had not resumed daily use three years after
they were discharged from treatment. More than three quarters of
the patients who entered methadone maintenance treatment (76%)
and nearly three quarters of the patients who entered therapeutic
communities (74%) or outpatient drug-free programs (72%) were
still not using opiates regularly three years later. A recent
follow-up study of 405 of the original 44,000 addicts found that
74% were not using heroin regularly twelve years after their
treatment ended. </p>

<p>Researchers have uniformly concluded that the three most
common forms of treatment are effective despite &quot;the variety
of problems suffered by clients, their long histories of deviant
and debilitating lifestyles, and a lack of support in the
community&quot; that lead so many addicts not to complete
treatment programs at all. Researchers also agree that the longer
addicts remain in treatment, the better their chances of success.
National studies of the behavior of thousands of addicts have
shown that, while one-third of the patients who stay in treatment
for more than three months are still not using drugs a year
later, two-thirds of those who stay in treatment for a year or
more stay off drugs. </p>

<h5>b. Studies Examining the Effects of Drug </h5>

<p>Treatment on the Consequences of Drug Abuse </p>

<p>Researchers have studied the impact of drug treatment on many
of the health and social problems that drug abuse contributes to
-- the spread of AIDS and other diseases, premature death, crime,
unemployment, costly medical care -- as one way of assessing the
success of drug treatment. Their studies have shown that
treatment reduces these associated consequences of drug abuse.
Treatment prevents the transmission of HIV and other blood-borne
diseases that spread when addicts share needles or sell sex for
drugs. Two studies have shown that the rate of HIV infection
among heroin addicts in New York City not in treatment (46%-47%)
is twice the rate of infection among addicts in methadone
treatment programs (23%-27%), and a recent study found that none
of a group of methadone patients with ten or more years in
treatment tested positive for HIV. </p>

<p>Research has shown that treatment also prevents crime. The
TOPS survey found that, in the six months following treatment,
97% of the residential therapeutic community clients and 70% of
the outpatient clients who had admitted committing predatory
crimes in the year before they entered treatment engaged in no
criminal activity at all. Three to five years after treatment,
the proportion of addicts involved in predatory crimes had fallen
by one half to two-thirds. The DARP study found that arrest rates
fell by 74% after treatment, for all treatment modalities.
Research reveals that treatment helps recovering addicts work, as
well. Only 33% of the 44,000 patients in the DARP study worked in
the year before admission to treatment, but 57% were employed in
the year following their discharge. Two- thirds of therapeutic
community patients were gainfully employed after discharge. The
employment rate of clients tracked in the TOPS study also surged.
Three to five years after patients entered treatment, the
employment of patients admitted to residential programs had
doubled over pre-treatment levels, while the employment of
addicts receiving outpatient treatment rose by more than half. </p>

<p>The costs of medical treatment for all sorts of health
problems decline when addicts receive treatment. As noted earlier
in this report, addicts themselves suffer many costly illnesses
as a result of drug use, ranging from hepatitis, syphilis and
tuberculosis to shingles, malnutrition and psychiatric problems.
In 1989, general hospital stays in which drugs or alcohol were
identified as a major factor accounted for 1.9 million days of
hospitalization in New York State alone. Using a conservatively
estimated average cost of $500 a day, that amounts to $9.5
billion worth of medical care. </p>

<p>Successful drug treatment starts addicts on their way to
physical recovery and therefore reduces these medical costs.
Successful drug treatment also prevents the spread of diseases to
others, such as children born to addicted mothers, and stems the
cost of medical care for them, as well as the cost of foster care
for children whose addicted parents cannot care for them. Other
benefits of treatment flow from its effects on criminal behavior
and employment. Treated addicts are much more likely to be
employed and therefore to contribute to the public coffers rather
than receive welfare. They make more productive employees and are
less likely to have accidents at work. Treated addicts are far
less likely to commit crimes and therefore will save society the
cost of property loss and prosecuting criminal activity. One
study that calculated the cost of crime, poor employment
activity, and medical treatment attributable to drug addiction
found that the total of these costs was ten to twenty-five times
the cost of treating drug addiction, depending on the cost of the
treatment chosen. The cost of treating an addict in a long-term
residential drug-free program, for example, was found to amount
to only four percent of the cost to society of not treating the
addict. </p>

<p>A comparison of costs also shows that treatment is much more
cost-effective than incarceration. In New York City, residential
drug treatment costs approximately $17,000 a year per treatment
bed, and outpatient treatment costs only $2,300-$4,000 a year per
treatment slot; the annual operating cost of a prison bed is
about $40,000, and the cost of building new prison cells exceeds
$100,000 each. Diverting drug abusers from prison to treatment
therefore saves New York State or City half the operating costs
of incarceration. It also alleviates the need to build expensive
new prisons. If the proven effect of treatment on criminal
recidivism is included, the savings to the criminal justice
system in the future would be even more substantial. Treatment
works and is, in fact, a much more cost-effective way of dealing
with substance abuse than arresting drug offenders and locking
them in prison. Successfully treated drug addicts give up crime,
become productive and more healthy citizens, and ultimately make
fewer demands on the public for social and medical services
throughout their lives. Their cure also reduces the overall
demand for drugs. </p>

<h4>7. Education Works </h4>

<p>One way to reduce the demand for illegal drugs is to prevent
individuals at an early and impressionable age from initiating
drug use. Using the school system and community programs to
educate children about drug use and its destructive consequences
is an idea that would undoubtedly be supported by many segments
of society. Logic suggests that education programs should be
effective in diverting young people from experimenting with
drugs. </p>

<p>Mathea Falco, in her book The Making of a Drug Free America,
details both school-based and community-based educational
programs which have proven results in preventing drug, alcohol
and tobacco use. Education has been shown to be effective in
preventing and reducing drug as well as tobacco and alcohol use
among children and teenagers. Simply to advocate
&quot;education,&quot; however, may not be enough; the assumption
that &quot;education,&quot; and any type of education program,
will be effective may be erroneous. Studies of the effectiveness
of drug education and prevention strategies seem to suggest that
long- term programs geared towards examining the &quot;social
influences&quot; leading to drug, alcohol, and tobacco use are
more successful in diverting and reducing subsequent use of
drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. These successful educational
programs are generally coupled with community and home prevention
and education programs. In contrast, certain short-term education
programs, which lack the corresponding community programs, have
not proven effective in actually reducing drug use. </p>

<h5>a. Life Skills Training Program </h5>

<p>This 15 session curriculum, which is geared towards junior
high school students, is designed to teach students personal
coping skills so that they may be better able to make decisions
and feel more confident in social situations. Evaluations of this
program, which has been taught in 150 junior high schools in New
York and New Jersey for the past ten years, show that rates of
smoking and marijuana use are one-half to three-quarters lower
among students who have participated in this program than those
who have not. </p>

<h5>b. Students Taught Awareness and Resistance </h5>

<p>This program, taught to first-year high school students,
combines a thirteen session classroom curriculum with
coordinating community, media, and family programs in an effort
to teach resistance skills to teenagers and reinforce the social
desirability of not using drugs. The program is followed-up with
a five-session booster course the following school year. This
program, in a five-year follow-up study, has been proven
effective in reducing the rate of tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol
use by 20% to 40% and cocaine use by 50%. </p>

<h5>c. Project Healthy Choices </h5>

<p>This program, geared towards sixth and seventh graders,
integrates discussions about drugs and alcohol into the everyday
curriculum by training teachers to incorporate the discussion of
drugs and alcohol into their teaching of academic subjects. This
program is currently implemented in approximately one hundred New
York City schools. It is believed that this approach will
reinforce prevention messages as the students will hear this
discussion as part of their learning on a wide variety of
subjects. The long-range effectiveness of this approach has not
yet been determined. </p>

<h5>d. Student Assistance Program </h5>

<p>This program, which has been implemented in junior and senior
high schools in twenty states, offers counseling during the
school day on a voluntary, confidential basis. A study of the
Westchester County, New York school system where the program was
originally implemented showed a significant reduction in alcohol
and marijuana use. More significantly, studies showed that the
rates of drinking and drug use were 30% lower among students at
schools which implemented the SAP program. </p>

<h5>e. Smart Moves </h5>

<p>&quot;Smart Moves&quot; is a program operated out of Boys and
Girls Clubs in the inner-cities where children live in high crime
neighborhoods. By offering after-school prevention programs and
recreational, educational, and vocational activities, this
program attempts to teach children to recognize the pressures to
use drugs and how to develop the verbal and social skills to
resist these pressures. Again, studies have shown that this type
of program can reduce cocaine and crack use and improve school
behavior and parental involvement. </p>

<h5>f. Seattle Social Development Project </h5>

<p>This comprehensive program seeks to strengthen the bond
between children from high crime neighborhoods and their families
and schools. The program provides to parents techniques to
monitor their children better; teachers get better training to
maintain order and resolve conflicts; and children, as in the
other programs, are taught skills to resist peer pressure.
Interestingly, while the program has shown results in deterring
girls from alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, it has not shown
similar effectiveness with boys. </p>

<h5>g. Programs for Children of Addicts </h5>

<p>Finally, a number of cities are attempting to develop
prevention programs geared towards the children of drug addicts.
These programs attempt to teach parents communication and
parenting skills and provide children with support and social
skills. Two such programs are &quot;Strengthening Families,&quot;
which has been implemented in Salt Lake City, Detroit, and Selma,
Alabama, and the &quot;Safe Haven&quot; program in Detroit.
Evaluations of the &quot;Strengthening Families&quot; program
suggest it strengthens family and school relationships and
affects attitudes towards alcohol and tobacco use. </p>

<p>This provides a summary of the types of successful programs
already available in the communities. Their success depends upon
a school and community commitment to implementing comprehensive
programs geared towards preventing drug use by children. The
diversity of the structure of the programs illustrates the
complexity of the problem. In addition to reaching out to the
&quot;average&quot; school age youth and warning them about the
dangers of substance abuse, there are children in high-risk homes
and crime-ridden neighborhoods who need additional support
structures to resist the pressures of drug use. </p>

<h2>III. TOWARD A NEW DRUG POLICY </h2>

<p>Joycelyn Elders, the United States Surgeon General, has
suggested that a study be made of our current drug policies and
perhaps a new drug policy adopted. Despite the Administration's
rejection of her suggestion, public perception is that she may be
right. Our government tried to prohibit alcohol consumption and
found it did not work. As demonstrated in this report, drug
prohibition is also a failure that causes more harm than the drug
use it is purportedly intended to control. The obvious answer is
that we must take the necessary steps towards a new approach to
drug policy. </p>

<p>Several different alternatives to drug prohibition are being
discussed. Federal District Judge Whitman Knapp suggests that
Congress should repeal all federal laws banning drug sales or
possession and permit states to devise alternatives to
prohibition. This is the present approach to alcohol in the
United States since the repeal of the 18th Amendment and the
Volstead Act. Federal District Judge Jack Weinstein suggests
&quot;standing down&quot; and making fewer arrests, having fewer
prosecutions, and spending more money on treatment. M.A.R.
Kleiman of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard suggests
as a solution to the drug problem a &quot;grudging
toleration&quot; allowing for sale of certain drugs through
state-regulated stores, but the strategy would be to discourage
consumption. </p>

<p>These and other alternatives to drug prohibition should be
thoroughly considered so that our society may choose a new
approach that will avoid the widespread evils caused by the
current drug laws. Any alternative to drug prohibition should
allow continued criminal sanctions against conduct affecting
others (the most obvious example being operating a vehicle while
under the influence). </p>

<p>It is the Committee's belief that a new approach to drug
policy should leave state and local governments free to employ
the full panoply of coercive penal sanctions when drug use is
relevant to conduct affecting others. For instance, as mentioned
above, operating any vehicle while under the influence of drugs
is not tolerated and that should not change. Although in New
York, voluntary intoxication remains relevant to negate specific
intent, the Legislature may wish to restore individual liability
in this area and make any intoxication that is voluntary
irrelevant as to mitigation, on the theory that by this voluntary
act the actor will be held responsible for the consequences of
his conduct while under the influence. Such a sanction is hardly
unreasonable, nor would it strike anyone as being unfair,
especially if facilities to deal with cases of actual addiction
were readily available. </p>

<p>Finally, any alternative to drug prohibition should not
preclude state and local governments from addressing
&quot;quality of life&quot; issues. Government should not be
powerless to control persons who are obviously and publicly
intoxicated. Through enforcement of the existing laws dealing
with public behavior, or appropriate amendments to such laws to
include specific conduct, government intervention would have
greater effect and would be readily accepted as appropriate by
the overwhelming majority of the population. </p>

<h2>IV. CONCLUSION </h2>

<p>The Special Committee on Drugs and the Law has spent the
better part of a decade examining this country's &quot;drug
problem&quot; and the mechanisms utilized to manage it,
principally a federal and state system of criminal proscription. </p>

<p>In recent years, the criminal penalties for possession and
distribution of proscribed drugs have increased, with mandatory
sentences being imposed at both the state and federal levels. The
prison population in the United States has more than doubled in
the past ten years, largely as the result of these prohibitionist
laws. The scarce resources of the federal and state judiciary
have been increasingly devoted to drug cases. </p>

<p>Despite all of these efforts, the drug war rages on. The
Committee recognizes the urgent and compelling need to make
additional resources available for education and treatment. We
believe that even at increased levels, however, treatment and
education are not enough to control this country's drug problem.
The Committee opposes the present prohibitionist system and
recommends the opening of a public dialog regarding new
approaches to drug policy, including legalization and regulation.

<p>SEPARATE STATEMENT TO A REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p>DRUGS AND THE LAW ENTITLED &quot;A WISER COURSE: ENDING DRUG
PROHIBITION&quot; </p>

<p>We are in agreement with the Report insofar as it calls for
the opening of a public dialog regarding new approaches to drug
policy but disagree with its conclusion that drug prohibition
should be ended. Our disagreement is based upon our concern that
the legal sale of drugs would increase substantially the number
of persons who use and/or become addicted to drugs, causing harm
not only to themselves but to society. Such harm would, in our
view, outweigh the benefits of eliminating drug prohibition. </p>

<p>1. Legalizing Drugs Would Reduce Their Cost to the Public,
Thereby Increasing Demand, Use and Addiction </p>

<p>The theory of drug legalization is that it would take the
profit motive out of illegal drug dealing, eliminating the evils
of drug prohibition. In order to accomplish this result drugs
would have to be sold at prices lower than their present illicit
levels. Many commentators have reached the conclusion that lower
prices would increase the demand for drugs. In Searching For
Alternatives - Drug-Control Policy in the United States, Edited
and With Introduction by Melvyn B. Krauss and Edward P. Lazear,
Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, Stanford,
California (1991), the authors have compiled commentar- ies from
both proponents and opponents of drug legalization, most of whom
acknowledged that lessening cost and increasing access may create
higher drug use. See, e.g., id. at 22-25; 83; 107. </p>

<p>2. The Report Fails to Provide a Concrete Proposal </p>

<p>The Report states that &quot;The Committee opposes the present
prohibitionist system . . . .&quot; However the Report provides
no concrete proposal that would permit us to determine whether
any net benefit to society would result from legaliza- tion.
Should we endorse either (i) the legal sale of crack,
amphetamines, hallucinogens and similar dangerous drugs or (ii)
the sale of drugs to minors? Certainly, if we accept the propo-
sition advanced by many commentators that the legal sale of
drugs, at lower prices than the prices of illegal drugs, would
greatly widen demand, we should reject the proposal that such
harmful substances as those mentioned above be legally sold or
that any drugs be sold to minors. On the other hand, prohibition
of sale of those substances, or of drugs generally to minors,
would give illegal drug traffickers a continuing opportunity to
exploit these markets, and thus by definition the proposal would
not end the evils of drug prohibition. </p>

<p>The Report's failure to provide a specific proposal leaves
these critical issues unresolved. We agree with the Report's
statement that &quot;These and other alternatives [types of
legalization proposals] should be thoroughly considered so that
our society may choose a new approach that will avoid the wide-
spread evils caused by the current drug laws.&quot; A simple end
to drug prohibition, however, cannot be accepted as a solution to
these evils, because the &quot;solution&quot; would produce
greater social harm than the present system. </p>

<p>3. The Report Does Not Set Forth Any Convincing Basis for Its
Conclusion That &quot;Use in Continued Moderation&quot; Would Be
The &quot;Much More Likely Result of Decriminalization&quot; </p>

<p>The Report states that &quot;the available evidence does not
support [the] assumption&quot; that the current prohibitionist
laws discourage many people from using drugs, citing: rising
levels of drug use, arrests and seizures; recent declines in
alcohol and tobacco consumption; the role of drug pushers in
boosting demand; a description of Prohibition suggesting no
correlation between prohibition and use; the results of a 1970's
experiment in which 10 states decriminalized possession of small
amounts of marijuana; and a poll taken of the general public. The
Report also cites drug use trends in the Netherlands and England,
where the problems are less severe than in the United States.
Since neither the United States nor any other developed country
has legalized the sale of drugs, there is, of course, no
empirical evidence directly on point. None of the evidence cited
in the Report refutes the strong likelihood that reducing prices
and facilitating access would significantly increase demand for
drugs. </p>

<p>Recent reductions in use of tobacco and alcohol are not
reliable guidelines for legalized drugs because the pleasure-
enhancing and tolerance-producing (i.e., addictive) characteris-
tics of cocaine, crack and heroin are far more powerful than
those of tobacco and alcohol. See, id. at 18, 24, 78. The results
of Prohibition suggests a correlation between prohibition and
use. Alcohol use declined at the outset of Prohibition and then
increased to only 60% to 70% of pre- Prohibition levels.
Immediately after Repeal, alcohol use re- mained the same, but it
increased to pre-Prohibition levels during the next decade. See,
Miron, &quot;Drug Legalization and the Consumption of Drugs: An
Economist's Perspective&quot;, published in Searching For
Alternatives - Drug-Control Policy in the United States, at id.,
pages 74 to 75. </p>

<p>England and the Netherlands both prohibit drug traf- ficking
and have relaxed enforcement only at the level of the consumer or
patient. The experiences in those countries do not provide any
basis for predictions as to the impact of drug legalization in
the United States where there are far higher levels of both
supply and demand of illegal drugs. See id. at 172-188.
Similarly, the ten states where possession of small amounts of
marijuana was decriminalized are not reliable indica- tors
because trafficking and sale continued to be prohibited. </p>

<p>4. The Report is Mistaken in Characterizing Drug Abuse as an
Individual &quot;Right&quot; rather than as a Social Evil </p>

<p>The Report argues that &quot;Ending drug prohibition would
enable the Court and our society to recognize the right of indi-
viduals to alter their consciousness (the most private of mat-
ters) so long as they do not harm others.&quot; Consistent with
this approach, the Report notes that &quot;Any alternative to
drug prohibition shall allow the continued minimal control of
conduct affecting others (the most obvious example being
operating a vehicle while under the influence).&quot; </p>

<p>In characterizing drug abuse as a &quot;right of individu-
als&quot; the Report ignores its social costs, which include
physical damage to babies born of drug using mothers; abuse
and/or neglect by users of parents, offspring, friends and
relatives; death by overdose; teen suicides; homelessness;
drug-induced altered states of consciousness producing violence,
particularly from the use of cocaine and crack; loss of
productivity of drug-using workers; waste of educational
resources used in attempts to teach drug-abusing students; the
ripple effect on the economy from the presence of large numbers
of incapacitated or impaired individu- als; and the enormous cost
of drug treatment programs. See, Commentary by various authors in
Krauss and Lazear, supra, at pages 97-107; 202-206; 227-236. </p>

<p>5. The Report Should Stress the Need to Reduce Demand for
Drugs Without Endorsing Legalization </p>

<p>The Report is enormously thoughtful and comprehensive and
deserves the most serious study. It describes accurately and
completely the importance and effectiveness of harm reduction and
drug treatment programs. For the reasons stated above, however,
the Report should not recommend ending drug prohibition. Because
of the risk of catastrophic social harm from legalization, many
of the most thoughtful recent works on this topic do not recom-
mend this approach. Mathea Falco, in The Making of a Drug-Free
America (1992), cited in the Report, urges against a &quot;bigger
drug war&quot; (emphasis supplied) and that &quot;[w]e need an
entirely differ- ent approach&quot; . . . &quot;one that puts
into practice what we have learned in recent years about reducing
the demand for drugs.&quot; Id. at 191, 201. The author points
out that &quot;. . . law enforce- ment plays an important role,
but it should not be the center- piece of drug policy.&quot; Id.
at 199. In Reckoning Drugs, the Cities, and the American Future
(1993), Elliot Currie, while noting the same evils of drug
prohibition relied upon in the Report, states: </p>

<p>&quot;. . . no one seriously doubts that legalization would
indeed increase availability, and probably lower prices for many
drugs. In turn, increased availability, as we know from the
experience with alcohol, typically leads to increased
consumption, and with it increased social and public health
costs.&quot; </p>

<p>Id. at 187. In Addiction From Biology to Drug Policy (1994),
Dr. Avram Goldstein recommends retaining the present prohibition
on heroin, cocaine and the amphetamines while endorsing a variety
of harm reduction and drug treatment methods aimed at reducing
demand. Id. at 268-285. In Drug Use in America (1994), (Peter J.
Vesturelli, Editor) Prof. Patricia A. Adler recommends a
&quot;middle ground . . . between the extremes of legalizing all
drugs and bearing the costs of the zero tolerance approach.&quot;
Id. at 260. The author endorses the regulated sale of marijuana
with the use of law enforcement savings for anti-drug abuse
programs aimed at heroin and cocaine. Id. at 262. Prof. Nadelmann
has commented, and we agree, that: &quot;Today, studies similar
to that of the Wickesham Commission and the Rockefeller
Foundation report [on prohibition and alcohol-control strategies
respectively] are necessary to any systematic evaluation of drug
prohibition and its alternatives.&quot; Krauss &amp; Lazear,
supra, at 242. </p>

<p>CONCLUSION </p>

<p>For the reasons above stated we agree with the emphasis of the
Report on further public dialog, harm reduction and drug
treatment but disagree with its conclusion that drug prohibition
should be ended. <br>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p><b>The Drug Policy Task Force, sponsored by the New York
Country Lawyers' Association, commenced its operations in the
Fall of 1993. The Task Force was established as a
&quot;blue-ribbon&quot; panel of prominent and respected
individuals, each known for his or her work, insights and
involvement in the area of drug policy reform.</b></p>

<p><b>The stated purpose of the Task Force has been to develop
and urge implementation of rational and workable alternatives to
current drug policy on both the state and federal levels.</b></p>

<p><b>In an effort to develop a comprehensive and well-balanced
approach to future drug policy, participants of the Task Force
were drawn from various disciplines, including legal, medical and
academic, as well as from each branch of government --
legislative, judicial and executive.</b></p>

<p><b>After extensive study, public hearings, discussion and
analysis of various issues within the broad scope of the drug
policy debate, this working body now offers its &quot;Report and
Recommendations&quot; for public consideration.</b></p>

<p><b>The work of the Task Froce, toward development of a
comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to an effective and
responsible drug policy, and in tackling the difficult issues
involved in this important area, is ongoing. The &quot;Report and
Recommendations&quot; which follow should be read and considered
in the context of the continuing nature of this endeavor.</b></p>

Failure Of Contemporary Drug Policy<br>
To Meet Its Stated Objectives</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>It has become a widely accepted fact that drug policy, as
employed during the past three decades by the federal government,
and in state and local jurisdictions throughout the United
States, has largely failed to meet its stated objectives. </p>

<p>Current drug policy relies on an &quot;enforcement&quot; or
&quot;penal&quot; model, emphasizing interdiction, arrest,
prosecution and incarceration of both distributors and users of
controlled substances as its primary &quot;weapons&quot; in what
has often been characterized as a &quot;war on drugs.&quot;
Commonly known substances generally designated as
&quot;controlled&quot; or illegal include: hallucinogens
(marijuana, hashish, mescaline and LSD), stimulants (amphetamines
and cocaine), and depressants (opium, heroin and barbiturates).
(1) </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the vast public resources expended on the
enforcement of penal statutes against users and distributors of
controlled substances, contemporary drug policy appears to have
failed, even on its own terms, in a number of notable respects.
These include: minimal reduction in the consumption of controlled
substances; failure to reduce violent crime; failure to markedly
reduce drug importation, distribution and street-level drug
sales; failure to reduce the widespread availability of drugs to
potential users; failure to deter individuals from becoming
involved in the drug trade; failure to impact upon the huge
profits and financial opportunity available to individual
&quot;entrepreneurs&quot; and organized underworld organizations
through engaging in the illicit drug trade; the expenditure of
great amounts of increasingly limited public resources in pursuit
of a cost-intensive &quot;penal&quot; or
&quot;law-enforcement&quot; based policy; failure to provide
meaningful treatment and other assistance to substance abusers
and their families; and failure to provide meaningful alternative
economic opportunities to those attracted to the drug trade for
lack of other available avenues for financial advancement. (2) </p>

<p>Moreover, a growing body of evidence and opinion suggests that
contemporary drug policy, as pursued in recent decades, may be
counterproductive and even harmful to the society whose public
safety it seeks to protect. This conclusion becomes more readily
apparent when one distinguishes the harms suffered by society and
its members directly attributable to the pharmacological effects
of drug use upon human behavior, from those harms resulting from
policies attempting to eradicate drug use. (3) </p>

<p>With aid of these distinctions, we see that present drug
policy appears to contribute to the increase of violence in our
communities. It does so by permitting and indeed, <i>causing</i>
the drug trade to remain a lucrative source of economic
opportunity for street dealers, drug kingpins and all those
willing to engage in the often violent, illicit, black market
trade. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the effect of present policy serves to stigmatize
and marginalize drug users, thereby inhibiting and undermining
the efforts of many such individuals to remain or become
productive, gainfully employed members of society. Furthermore,
current policy has not only failed to provide adequate access to
treatment for substance abuse, it has, in many ways, rendered the
obtaining of such treatment, and of other medical services, more
difficult and even dangerous to pursue. (4) </p>

<p>The appropriate goal of any drug policy must be to decrease
the prevalence and spread of harmful drug use and substance
abuse, and to minimize the harms associated with such problems
where they are found to exist. (5) Additionally, any policy which
creates more harmful results than the societal problems it
proposes to solve, must be re-evaluated in terms of the
advisability of further pursuit of such policy. Further, to
justify continuation of any public policy, the costs incurred
must always be weighed against the benefits derived. It is within
this context, and with these criteria in mind, that present
approaches to drug policy must be objectively assessed and, where
appropriate, alternative models for future policy evaluated and
considered. (6) </p>

<p>In making its assessment, the Task Force has concluded that
contemporary drug policy has failed by virtually every objective
standard. Accordingly, we call for a dramatic shift in thinking
and approach in development and implementation of future drug
control efforts. At this time, although not recommending
&quot;decriminalization&quot; or &quot;legalization&quot; of most
substances currently designated as &quot;controlled&quot; under
federal and state penal statutes, the Task Force does urge that
certain incremental steps be taken to alleviate the more easily
resolved economic and social costs associated with current drug
policy. These include: the decriminalization of marijuana;
further measures attempting to separate the &quot;hard&quot; drug
markets (e.g., for heroin and cocaine), from markets for
&quot;soft&quot; drugs (e.g., marijuana and hashish); the
downward modification of existing draconian sentences for other
non-violent drug offenses; the elimination of mandatory minimum
sentences in drug cases; and increased judicial discretion in the
sentencing of drug offenders, with further reliance upon drug
treatment and other diversionary programs as alternatives to
incarceration for the non-violent drug offender. Moreover, we
highly recommend the further study and serious consideration of
other alternative, non-criminal, regulatory drug control
measures, developed in accordance with a &quot;public
health&quot; rather than a &quot;penal&quot; model of drug
policy. </p>

The Costs Of<br>
Current Drug Policy</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<h3><a name="part2a"></a>A. The Economic Costs</h3>

<p>Whether viewed in isolation or on balance with the benefits
derived, there can be no question that the economic costs of
contemporary drug policy, as employed on the federal and state
levels, have proved unacceptably high. Indeed, as we face a
future of increasingly limited resources, the continuation of
present policy, with overwhelming emphasis on the arrest,
prosecution and incarceration of drug offenders, will produce
exponential growth in expenditures required to accommodate and
maintain this policy. (7) </p>

<p>As a result of the stepped up incarceration of &quot;drug
offenders&quot; during the past three decades, since the early
1970's, our nation has seen an alarming increase in the number of
individuals incarcerated within its borders. (8) Meanwhile, in
addition to all other resources utilized, the need for additional
prison beds and increased correctional budgets has also grown
exponentially, on both state and federal levels. (9) </p>

<p>Other unacceptably high costs in the present
&quot;penal-based&quot; model of drug policy have been: court
budgets strained beyond capacity, affecting the ability of our
court systems to adequately address both criminal and civil cases
coming within their respective jurisdictions; large portions of
federal, state and local law enforcement resources devoted to
drug interdiction, arrest and prosecution; large portions of
federal and state prosecutors' budgets devoted to drug cases;
increased costs for court appointed public defenders; and growing
budgets for other national and international drug enforcement
efforts -- all exacting a substantial drain on the increasingly
limited financial resources of the nation. </p>

<p>Further, the exponential growth in the number of individuals
incarcerated throughout the nation has already, and will
increasingly, cause incalculable economic costs in terms of: lost
productivity of those individuals incarcerated; state support of
families deprived of breadwinners; and the economic decline of
impoverished communities through incarceration of great numbers
of those in the prime of their productive lives, and their
reduced earning capacity upon release from prison. </p>

<h3><a name="part2b"></a>B. The Social Costs</h3>

<p>The adverse effects of current drug policy have been felt most
profoundly in the urban centers of our nation. The imposition of
penal sanctions for drug possession and sale has proven a
woefully ineffective and otherwise harmful means of attempting to
control substance abuse in communities where, for some, drugs are
often the only escape from the harsh realities of poverty. In a
climate where there is no treatment on demand, criminalizing the
substance abuser may be viewed as profoundly inhumane and
counterproductive. </p>

<p>Imprisoning individuals for drug use causes further detriment
to those individuals and their families, destroying family
cohesion and undermining rehabilitation efforts. (10) The
increase in fatherless and motherless homes, which the current
policy of emphasis on incarceration causes, is extraordinarily
disruptive to the family unit, where often, those harmed the most
are the children. The separation of children from their primary
caretakers due to long term imprisonment, often results in a
marked decline in the quality of shelter, nutrition, medical
assistance and emotional nurturing. Studies have shown that
children whose primary caretakers have spent significant amounts
of time in prison are more likely to manifest symptoms of
anxiety, depression, behavioral difficulties and juvenile
delinquency, which may often be followed by adult criminal
activity. (11) Many of these children, often left in the care of
less able caretakers, have turned to peer relationships with
gangs, seeking to establish a family substitute. (12) </p>

<p>The criminalization and consequent stigmatization of drug
users, whether or not accompanied by a period of incarceration,
&quot;marginalizes&quot; users, since a criminal record decreases
the likelihood of successful employment and complete
rehabilitation, while continuing to impact upon family finances.
This, in turn, exacerbates financial and social instability in
households, and financial and emotional instability in
neighborhoods, while burdening otherwise stretched resources of
public assistance programs. </p>

<p>Moreover, the increased enforcement of civil forfeiture laws
has further undermined the security and stability of families.
Recognizing a growing trend of evictions and asset forfeiture as
a further weapon employed in the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; entire
families have lost and continue to lose homes and other
substantial assets for the acts of a single household member,
thereby punishing even drug-free members of the community. (13) </p>

<p>The black market created by drug prohibition turns
neighborhoods into war zones -- through turf wars over the huge
profits to be made in the illicit drug industry, violent
altercations over drug transactions gone bad, and battles between
local drug dealers and law-enforcement officers. The increase in
violent street crime which this situation engenders, aggravated
by the experience of violent prison culture which incarcerated
offenders bring back to their neighborhoods upon release, creates
a dangerous situation for all members of inner city communities. </p>

<p>Moreover, the street culture of guns and violence spawned by
the drug trade spills over into other social interaction in urban
neighborhoods, with violence becoming a commonly accepted mode of
conflict resolution. Community residents live in fear of the
violent street culture generated, in large part, by the
black-market drug trade, and the increased incidence of innocent
pedestrians struck in the cross-fires or by stray bullets from
battles involving participants in the drug trade. (14) </p>

<p>History has shown us that even in an atmosphere of prohibition
and criminalization of drug dealing, participation in the drug
trade will continue to be widespread, since it indisputably
provides the greatest entrepreneurial opportunity to many in
poorer communities. There is a strong economic motivation for
young people and those who might otherwise be legally employed
and law-abiding to engage in the sale of drugs, due to the high
profits generated by the illicit industry in an environment of
drug prohibition, and the dearth of opportunities for poor,
uneducated youth in the legitimate job market. </p>

<p>Harsh sentencing laws themselves lead to the active
recruitment of children and first time offenders (frequently
women - &quot;drug mules&quot;) into the drug trade, so that
dealers themselves can escape such penalties. (15) Evidence
further reveals, that due to the great economic incentives
represented by the illicit drug trade, when one street dealer is
temporarily incapacitated by incarceration, there is a ready
supply of others waiting in the wings to fill the gap in the
market. As such, not only does the widespread incarceration of
low-level drug dealers fail to deter others from entering into
the drug trade, it arguably draws more individuals into the
illegal trade than would otherwise occur without the periodic
removal of many of its participants. (16) </p>

<p>Moreover, the deterrence rationale of harsh sentencing does
not necessarily operate among the drug dealing community as might
be anticipated, where many assume the extraordinary risks already
involved in the violent but lucrative illicit drug trade. As one
observer has noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Apprehended dealers are replaced from a seemingly
    bottomless pool, for jail is not a deterrent to those who
    daily risk death in the drug trade.&quot; (17)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, with respect to users of certain controlled
substances, it appears questionable that conventional deterrence
theory can be meaningfully applied where substance abuse may be
accompanied by physical addiction. </p>

<p>Finally, a social byproduct of the misplaced allocation of
financial resources which concentrates huge expenditures on the
apprehension and imposition of penal sanctions on drug users and
local drug dealers, is a clogged criminal justice system unable
to focus on society's larger crime problems. Courts jammed with
drug cases inevitably results in insufficient resources available
to properly attend to these and other more serious crimes
appearing on overburdened court dockets. This logjam leads to
instances of &quot;revolving door&quot; justice even for violent
criminals, since the system simply cannot handle the overload.
(18) A further result of these conditions is a perceived
trivialization of violent crime itself, reinforced by a penal
scheme which punishes drug crimes as severely or more severely
than many criminal acts of violence. </p>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part3"></a>III.<br>
Public Health Consequences<br>
Of Current Drug Policy</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>The Task Force views substance abuse as, first and foremost, a <i>public
health</i> issue. Accordingly, it appears that problems of
substance abuse would be more appropriately and effectively
addressed within our health care delivery systems, rather than by
our law enforcement agencies, courts and correctional
institutions. </p>

<p>The emphasis on a &quot;penal&quot; model of drug control
results in reduced funding for drug treatment facilities. This is
an unfortunate irony, since, as concluded by RAND researchers in
a 1994 report, a dollar's worth of drug treatment is worth seven
dollars spent on the most successful law-enforcement efforts to
curb the use of cocaine. (19) </p>

<p>Moreover, the fear of arrest, stigmatization and even removal
of their children from homes, (20) discourages substance abusers
from taking advantage of those health care and counseling
facilities which are available. (21) Pregnant women who are
substance abusers are deterred from seeking adequate prenatal
care, resulting in unhealthier children. A single positive drug
test result during pregnancy can trigger mandatory reporting
requirements. Therefore, the current policy of criminalization of
drug use amplifies potential health hazards of substance abuse,
and inhibits access to treatment, even for non-drug use related
health care. </p>

<p>Since possession and sale of any controlled substance is
illegal, dangerous drugs (which despite criminalization are still
widely available on the black market) are completely unregulated.
Under a scheme of criminalization, regulatory control is ceded to
underworld figures, including violent, predatory and often
ruthless criminals. This total lack of quality control of illicit
drugs on the market results in more dangerous, adulterated drugs
being produced and consumed, which, in turn, causes more disease
and death from the use of controlled substances than would occur
if the production and distribution of these drugs were regulated
by, for instance, U.S. Food and Drug Administration safety
regulations, warnings and other labeling requirements. (22) </p>

<p>The &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach to the &quot;drug
problem,&quot; with its primary emphasis on law enforcement and
penal sanctions, results in an absence of any quality control for
illegal drugs widely consumed throughout the nation, and a lack
of information concerning safer drug use. This presents further
serious health costs brought on by current drug policy, which
ignores the reality that some degree of drug use in our society
is inevitable. This lack of public education and safety
regulations dramatically, and unnecessarily, increases the health
risks involved in the consumption of those drugs presently
designated as illegal. </p>

<p>Accordingly, it appears that present drug control laws
themselves, have directly led to an increase in the health risks
associated with drug use and substance abuse. In addition to
those dangers posed by lack of quality control and safety
regulations governing illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia laws,
together with a failure to promote needle exchange programs, have
resulted in the preventable spread of AIDS and other similarly
transmitted diseases to users, their partners and children. (23) </p>

<p>Moreover, easier interdiction of marijuana, (with a larger
mass than other controlled substances), causes greater relative
availability of &quot;harder,&quot; stronger, more dangerous
drugs (e.g., cocaine and heroin), which are easier to conceal,
transport and distribute. Additionally, increased dangers to our
youth and others who may consume &quot;soft&quot; drugs, (e.g.,
marijuana and hashish), result from failure of current policy to
separate out the markets for &quot;hard&quot; drugs from those
for &quot;soft&quot; drugs. Therefore, since consumption of all
of these drugs is illegal, (and distributed in the same
&quot;black-market&quot;), those who only purchase and smoke
marijuana, for instance, are inevitably forced to come in contact
with a more dangerous criminal element in order to obtain this
relatively harmless substance. (24) </p>

<p>Violence associated with the illicit drug trade creates
substantial public health problems, in the form of injuries and
death. These health problems arise from effects of drug
prohibition rather than substance abuse <i>per se</i>. Evidence
suggests that gunshot wounds (due to &quot;drug-trade
related&quot; violence) are more prevalent than overdoses
(&quot;drug-induced&quot; injuries) in inner city hospital
emergency rooms of major metropolitan areas. (25) Moreover, in
addition to the empirical evidence, our nation's experience with
alcohol prohibition suggests the validity of these observations.
Once prohibition ended, so did the violence associated with black
market alcohol distribution. (26) </p>

<p>&quot;Drug prohibition&quot; also causes an increased demand
for more potent <i>legal</i> substances, like alcohol, which is
decidedly more harmful than certain controlled substances, most
notably, marijuana. (27) Moreover, current drug policy is found
to be, in ways, arbitrary and inconsistent, since it has been
proven that among the most dangerous commonly consumed drugs are
tobacco and alcohol, both of which are legal. (28) </p>

<p>Finally, current drug policy discourages research into
potentially therapeutic effects of psychotropic drugs, (29) e.g.
&quot;medical marijuana,&quot; which is known to alleviate the
suffering of cancer patients and to be therapeutically beneficial
in treatment of certain other diseases. (30) </p>

<hr>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part4"></a>IV.<br>
The Relationship of<br>
Drug Policy to Violent Crime</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>There exists a large and growing body of respected opinion and
credible evidence which suggests that contemporary drug policy
has failed to deter or reduce the prevalence of violent crime in
our communities, notwithstanding harsh treatment of drug
offenders under present &quot;penal&quot; or &quot;law
enforcement&quot; based policy. Indeed, many observers have
concluded that the current form of &quot;drug prohibition&quot;
has <i>generated</i> a great deal of violence, much of it armed
violence encountered in the lucrative underworld drug industry,
and some deriving from law enforcement efforts themselves in the
&quot;war on drugs&quot;. </p>

<p>In analyzing these issues, we take great care to distinguish
between violence caused by actual <i>drug use or substance abuse</i>
(&quot;drug-induced&quot; violence), and violence caused as a
byproduct of the high stakes involved in the illicit drug trade
(&quot;drug trade&quot; or &quot;drug prohibition&quot; related
violence). (31) This distinction is critical, because unless the
causes of crimes and violence are accurately identified, no
effective solutions can be found. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that some forms of drug use may result in
undesirable, unacceptable and anti-social behavior. (32) However,
it appears that the overwhelming causes of violent crimes, which
often find categorization under the heading of &quot;drug
related,&quot; are caused by various factors unrelated to actual
pharmacological effects of controlled substances upon human
behavior. (33) Rather, much of the violent crime can be said to
be &quot;drug prohibition-related,&quot; insofar as it results
from the high costs, huge profits and great stakes involved in
the world of drug commerce as is carried on in cities, states and
nations throughout the world. (34) Moreover, the complete banning
of all forms of use and sale of controlled substances, including
marijuana and hashish, has fostered an underworld black market,
for both &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; drugs, where
violence and weapons possession is part and parcel of doing
business under conditions of illegality. </p>

<p>In cities throughout the United States, we find a
proliferation of armed violence resulting from &quot;turf&quot;
wars for control of territory for lucrative drug sales, together
with regularly recurring dangerous and deadly altercations over
drug deals gone bad. In addition to this community-based
violence, there are &quot;shoot-outs&quot; between drug dealers
and law enforcement officers, the latter developing the need for
greater and more powerful weapons, only to be matched and then
surpassed by those in the drug trade who have enormous profits,
and personal liberty, at stake. The net result of these
circumstances has been an extraordinary casualty rate for those
involved in the drug trade, (35) injury and death to innocent
bystanders &quot;caught in the crossfires,&quot; injury and loss
of life to law enforcement officers, and a prevailing atmosphere
of violence in many inner city communities. </p>

<p>A further byproduct of these conditions is an increase of
weapons possession, and thereby, the weapons trade, where use and
sale of dangerous and increasingly powerful weapons have
proliferated. This widespread possession and use of dangerous and
deadly weapons has further resulted in the increase of armed
violence in our communities, not always directly related to local
drug wars, but fostered by the undercurrent of violence, guns and
money supported by the drug trade. </p>

<p>We note other ways in which current drug policy is likely
serving to exacerbate rather than alleviate violence in our
communities. Over the past decades, stepped up law enforcement
efforts, disproportionately carried out in our inner city
communities, have resulted in large and increasing numbers of
minority youth being brought within control of the criminal
justice system. It is reported that almost 1 in every 3 young
black men in the U.S., between the ages of 20-29, is presently
within the control of the criminal justice system -- either in
prison, on parole or on probation. (36) This figure is up from
approximately 1 in every 4 as reported just 5 years ago. (37)
Together with the destabilization of families and communities
affected by wholesale removal of young men from their ranks, many
individuals arrested and incarcerated for the inherently
&quot;non-violent&quot; offenses of drug possession or sale, are
then exposed to the violence of prison culture. This violence is,
in turn, brought back to the communities to which these members
invariably return. </p>

<p>Current drug policy's emphasis on drug arrests, prosecution
and incarceration, also indirectly increases violence by
diverting law enforcement, court and other criminal justice
resources from concentration on violent crime and violent
criminal offenders. Further, institutional pressures bear upon
prosecutors to concentrate on drug case, since the availability
of paid and trained police and other law enforcement officers, as
primary witnesses in such cases, renders prosecution of drug
cases easier and the statistical rates of conviction (or return)
more favorable. (38) This is not to discount the political
emphasis often placed on prosecution of drug cases, nor, of
course, the obligation of prosecutors to process those cases in
which legally supportable arrests under current law have been
made. The net result has been a dramatic shift in the proportion
of &quot;non-violent&quot; to &quot;violent&quot; offenders
incarcerated in jails and prisons throughout the United States --
such shift decidedly toward imprisonment of
&quot;non-violent&quot; drug offenders, (39) further stretching
resources and limiting the ability of correctional institutions
to hold and maintain &quot;violent&quot; offenders within their
walls. (40) </p>

<p>On a more global level, there can be no question that the
immense fortunes to be made by involvement in the underground,
black market world of drug commerce, has resulted in enormous
power and wealth for national and international narcotics cartels
which, in the experience of various smaller nations, has
threatened national security itself. (41) </p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that the most dangerous threats to our
security relating to drugs -- in our cities, throughout our
nation and even, internationally -- derive not from the
pharmacological effects of drug usage, but from the violence
engaged in and power amassed by an entire industry of underworld
figures, driven by the high costs and huge profits to be made in
the illicit drug trade. </p>

<p>Searching our nation's history for similar experiences from
which we may draw guidance, we turn, as many studying this issue
have, to our national experience with alcohol prohibition during
the early 20th century. (42) During that era of alcohol
prohibition, it was the <i>illegality</i> of that
&quot;controlled substance,&quot; alcohol, which drove up its
costs, caused a lucrative black market to develop, and supported
a widespread growth in wealth and power for underworld figures
and organizations. (43) This, in turn, brought on violence --
between competing bootleggers and racketeers, and between these
underworld interests and law enforcement officers -- as well as
other related and unrelated violence, much as we see today with
respect to the drug trade, although on a much larger scale. In
the case of drugs and &quot;drug prohibition,&quot; the
illegality of these substances has supported and perpetuated the
violent culture and dangerous cartels which have profited from
the resulting economic circumstances. As one commentator has
remarked: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;People aren't killing each other because they are
    high on drugs, any more than Al Capone ordered the execution
    of rival bootleggers because he was drunk.&quot; (44)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the final analysis, it appears evident that our nation's
drug policy has not only failed to resolve the problems of
violent crime, it has served to exacerbate them. Indeed, our
nation's &quot;war on drugs,&quot; as it has come to be known,
has likely had the net effect of causing a more dangerous
&quot;war&quot; to rage within our communities, with the only
vision of the future appearing to be, if present trends continue,
an increase in violence, the proliferation of weapons, a steady
supply of new community based drug dealers, and the continued
growth of ever-more dangerous &quot;kingpins&quot; and underworld
organizations -- all driven by the engine of the lucrative,
illegal drug trade. </p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that forms of
&quot;decriminalization,&quot; &quot;legalization,&quot; or
ending &quot;drug prohibition,&quot; must be seriously considered
as alternative directions for future drug strategy, however
radical such ideas may presently appear. (45) Accordingly, the
Task Force urges the further study of alternative, non-penal
based models, in development of future drug policy. </p>

<p>In summary, it is abundantly clear that, whatever the harms
presently caused by use and abuse of &quot;controlled&quot;
substances in our nation, many of the more pressing concerns with
respect to violence in our communities are unlikely to be solved
until we find a way to take the profit out of the black market
drug trade itself. If we continue to fail in addressing these
issues in an objective, rational and progressive manner, we may
find ourselves devoured by a larger, more dangerous beast of our
own creation. </p>

<hr>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part5"></a>V.<br>
Drug Policy, Drug Law<br>
Enforcement And People Of Color</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>The empirical evidence available clearly demonstrates that the
adverse effects of current drug policy impact disproportionately
on people of color. Although it is estimated that over 80% of
drug users are white, minorities comprise 74% of those
incarcerated for drug offenses. (46) Therefore, the injustices
inherent in the enforcement and criminal prosecution of drug
offenses impact more profoundly on communities of color. </p>

<p>Mandatory drug sentencing laws and the mass guilty pleas they
entail lead to insufficient checks on improper police activity,
since, generally, no trial or suppression hearings occur when a
defendant pleads guilty, at which forums improprieties on the
part of law enforcement officers may be exposed. Civil rights are
eroded with the creation of additional exceptions to the Fourth
Amendment's bar on warrantless searches (in what has effectively
become the &quot;drug exception&quot; to the U.S. Constitution),
while discriminatory stereotyping regarding the profile of a drug
dealer leads to the more frequent search and seizure of people of
color. Further, vaguely worded loitering and curfew laws,
intended to curb drug dealing, are disproportionately enforced on
inner city streets. </p>

<p>Other factors lead to a disparity in the racial makeup of
those arrested for narcotics offenses. Wealthier white drug users
make their purchases behind closed doors, in business districts
and in more isolated suburban communities, away from the eye of
law enforcement agents -- and therefore, more frequently escape
detection. On the other hand, street dealers, and many drug users
in inner city neighborhoods are considerably more exposed. </p>

<p>At the same time, a statistically high number of drug
prosecutions result in convictions. This is largely due to the
&quot;professional&quot; nature of witnesses involved in
narcotics cases, and because drug offenders are typically
apprehended as a result of &quot;buy-and-bust&quot; operations or
pursuant to &quot;observation sales,&quot; where police set up
operations in designated &quot;high crime&quot; neighborhoods, so
as to make undercover purchases from street dealers, and/or
observe and apprehend individuals involved in street sale and
purchase of narcotics. (47) Additionally, such community based
&quot;buy-and-bust&quot; and other similar operations tend to
concentrate on low level dealers and users rather than the drug
kingpins, since street sellers and purchasers are simply easier
to locate and apprehend. </p>

<p>Current drug policy has other irrational and discriminatory
consequences, e.g. the disparate treatment of crack-cocaine
offenders (generally poor people of color), versus powder-cocaine
offenders (generally white, middle-upper class), and the
inequitable prison sentences which this duplicity engenders. (48) </p>

<p>Due to lack of other forms of attention, by government and
private industry, inner city neighborhoods have become the
battleground for much of the drug trade, including enforcement
efforts by police. Moreover, the great sums of money involved in
the illegal drug trade encourages police corruption, leading to a
breakdown of appropriate law enforcement efforts in these
communities. Furthermore, broadly drafted civil forfeiture and
other similar laws, providing for the eviction of entire families
where one of its members may be involved in drug dealing, (49)
are more frequently enforced in poor communities, leading to
greater hardship in communities where higher numbers of black and
Latino people reside. </p>

<p>In summary, many of the social costs outlined in Section II(B)
above, are more profoundly felt in minority communities, to wit:
high incarceration rates, increase in fatherless and motherless
homes; active recruitment of children into the drug trade so that
dealers can escape harsh penalties of the drug laws; greater
financial and emotional instability in households; greater
financial and social instability in neighborhoods;
criminalization and stigmatization of many young members of these
communities, affecting their future employability; serious injury
to innocent bystanders caught in the &quot;cross-fires&quot; of
rival drug dealers and their battles with police; and a pervasive
street culture of guns and violence growing out of the drug trade
affecting other forms of social interaction in urban
neighborhoods, with violence becoming a commonly accepted mode of
conflict resolution. </p>

<p>Since current drug policy so profoundly and disproportionately
impacts upon people of color, review of present laws must be
undertaken to remove any discriminatory bias, and steps taken to
ensure that whatever drug control laws and strategies are
employed in the future, that they are fairly conceived and
even-handedly enforced. </p>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part6"></a>VI.<br>
The Impact Of Current<br>
Drug Policy On Women</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>Women, particularly minority women, have disproportionately
felt the adverse impact of the harsh drug sentencing laws. (50) A
study of female &quot;drug mules&quot; was conducted by the
Correctional Association of New York, (51) focused on
prosecutions occurring in Queens, New York, where JFK
International Airport serves as a major entry port for
international travel. The Correctional Association found a
startling increase in the number of women arrested and charged
with &quot;A-I&quot; felony narcotics offenses, many of whom were
first time arrestees. This was primarily a result of the combined
effect of the accessorial liability statute and the
&quot;Rockefeller Drug Laws,&quot; so that women suspected of
being used as couriers by drug smugglers frequently faced
mandatory prison sentences of 15 and 25 years-to-life, even on
their first arrest. (52) </p>

<p>The report further found that despite the fact that many of
these women claimed to be unwitting agents of drug distributors,
or marginally involved in drug operations, they did not go to
trial because of the excessively high stakes involved. Plea
bargain agreements, which guaranteed relatively short sentences
of 3 years-to-life, was &quot;too good&quot; an offer to refuse,
(although unconscionable under many individual circumstances),
given the risk of a much more severe sentence if found guilty at
trial. Many of these women were mothers, (53) unable or unwilling
to risk being separated from their children for considerably
longer periods in the event of conviction after trial, and
therefore pleaded guilty even if they were innocent or able to
present valid defenses to the offense charged. </p>

<p>In these cases, women are disproportionately affected by the
lack of judicial discretion involved in the mandatory sentences
statutes, regardless of any mitigating circumstances which may
exist. (54) Due to draconian drug laws such as these, which often
fail to distinguish between major and minor participants in drug
cases, fail to provide any relief for first time offenders, or to
allow reasonable consideration of other mitigating factors and/or
individual characteristics of the defendant, the resulting rate
of incarceration for women in Queens County, and for women
throughout the U.S., has grown dramatically in recent years. This
growth includes an increase of 275% from 1980 to 1992, in the
total number of women incarcerated in the U.S.; and an increase
of 433% during the five year period from 1986 to 1991, in the
number of women incarcerated in state prisons for drug offenses.
(55) </p>

<p>Even those women who are not defendants in drug cases are
profoundly affected by current drug policy, with its emphasis on
enforcement rather than rehabilitation. When fathers are
incarcerated for drug use or sale, it is the women who are left
to raise children in single parent households. When teenage boys
become involved in the drug trade, it is their mothers who are
evicted when civil forfeiture laws are enforced. When men who are
injection drug users share needles because of lack of
availability of clean needles, the women they sleep with risk HIV
infection. </p>

<p>For those women who have substance abuse problems, a
combination of mandatory reporting requirements and the child
abuse and neglect laws serve to deprive them of access to medical
services, pre-natal care, and even substance abuse counseling.
(56) </p>

<p>A further disturbing trend has emerged in states throughout
the nation, wherein pregnant women and new mothers, suffering
from substance abuse problems, face criminal prosecution on
serious charges, including drug distribution, assault and murder,
upon theories that such drug use, while pregnant, constitutes
&quot;delivery&quot; of drugs to the unborn fetus. (57) In these
cases, it is asserted that injury to the unborn and newly born
infant justifies imposition of severe criminal sanctions upon the
female drug user. These criminal prosecutions represent a new and
novel category of penal sanctions, (58) from which men are
entirely excluded -- another unfortunate result of our nation's
current punitive approach to drug policy. </p>

Effects Of Contemporary Drug Policy<br>
On The Integrity Of Government</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>As a general principle, where respect for the integrity of
government is severely compromised, its ability to govern and the
rule of law itself breaks down. In this regard, we note that past
decades of drug policy, characterized by use of draconian penal
sanctions, has resulted in legislative and enforcement measures
of questionable wisdom and validity. </p>

<p>Integrity of government and, specifically, respect for its
representatives in the law enforcement community has been further
eroded by repeated incidents of individual and systemic police
corruption relating to the lucrative, black-market drug trade
with which many law enforcement officers come into contact.
Meanwhile, extreme harshness of drug laws, often requiring
draconian mandatory minimum sentences in the event of conviction
after trial, causes widespread plea bargaining and entry of
guilty pleas, even where such pleas are inappropriate. This
results in insufficient checks on improper police activity,
generally tested at hearings or trial of such cases. It further
results in the criminal conviction of innocent individuals, and
incarceration of many such individuals, (albeit for shorter
periods than had they been convicted after trial). A further
product of these circumstances, is the widespread deprivation to
individuals of the right to due process of law (through inability
to risk trial), and overall loss of confidence in the ability to
obtain fair treatment in our courts of justice. </p>

<p>Furthermore, there is a growing lack of respect for a justice
system where drug use or sale, although not generally viewed as
being as dangerous or morally reprehensible as the perpetration
of violent crime (e.g., robbery, assault, murder), is
nevertheless prosecuted more frequently, and more consistently.
We must also be mindful of the &quot;trivialization&quot; of
violent criminal conduct, fostered by undue emphasis upon drug
law enforcement and by a penal scheme which punishes drug crimes
as severely or more severely than many violent crimes. In New
York, for example, the sale of a $10 dollar quantity of cocaine
(a Class B felony) is treated as severely as the serious felonies
of armed robbery and rape, and more severely than the highest
charge of assault, i.e., crimes resulting serious physical injury
(a Class C felony). (59) </p>

<p>The inordinate concentration on street-level drug users and
sellers, (generally in inner city neighborhoods, often regarded
to as &quot;high crime&quot; areas), has resulted in the
disproportionate and discriminatory impact of drug laws upon
people of color throughout our nation. (60) Moreover, widespread
injustice often results from the imposition of unduly harsh
prison sentences upon drug offenders, pursuant to mandatory
minimum sentencing statutes, even for first time offenders
playing peripheral roles in the drug offenses with which they are
charged. (61) </p>

<p>Additionally, the substantial and relentless street-level
enforcement of drug laws, targeted mainly at youth populations in
our inner city communities, (unmatched by efforts to reduce
violent crime), has resulted in an atmosphere of police at
&quot;war&quot; with the community, and garnering a growing
disrespect for law enforcement and the perpetuation of an
&quot;us-against-them&quot; mentality with respect to both the
law enforcement community and the government which it represents. </p>

<p>The erosion of civil liberties tolerated in the name of the
&quot;war on drugs,&quot; has become so extreme that some
commentators have gone so far as to claim that &quot;[t]he Bill
of Rights is in danger of becoming meaningless in cases involving
drugs.&quot; (62) </p>

<p>The perceived imperative of waging the drug war has twisted
constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and
seizures by state officials beyond all recognition, setting an
ominous precedent for the widespread violation of individual
rights which inevitably extends to other governmental activities.
What might be called the &quot;drug exception&quot; to the
Constitution threatens the civil liberties of every citizen,
since precedents set in the context of a drug case are later
cited to justify limitations of civil rights in other contexts.
As has been further noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The Supreme Court has permitted warrantless searches
    of automobiles, the use of anonymous tips and drug-courier
    profiles as the basis for police searches, and the seizure of
    lawyers' fees in drug cases. Property on which marijuana
    plants are found can be forfeited even if the owner is
    charged with no crime.&quot; (63)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also subject to continuing erosion are our citizens' rights to
privacy in the name of the &quot;drug war,&quot; represented by
unwarranted and unjustified drug testing of employees, property
searches of children, and other intrusions into the lives of
individuals not otherwise implicated in any criminal conduct so
as to justify such intrusions. For example, all federal employees
are required to submit to urine testing. (64) Such testing has
also become commonplace in private industry, not otherwise
confined by constitutional limitations but, nevertheless,
encouraged by governmental policies. </p>

<p>Serious &quot;due process&quot; and moral implications arise
through increased use of civil forfeiture laws, where innocent
families are deprived of substantial assets and, at times, their
homes, due to acts of a single household member, in which they
had no involvement and over which they had no control. For
example, the elderly mother of a drug dealer, who personally has
not participated in any illicit activities, may be evicted from
her home on the grounds that drug related activities were taking
place under her roof. Under these circumstances, the government
need only show that there existed reasonable grounds to believe
the property was subject to forfeiture -- i.e. that the home was
being used for illicit drug dealing activities. The burden of
proof then shifts to the owner (or lessee) of the property to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is
&quot;innocent&quot;. (65) Meanwhile, innocent family members of
suspected drug dealers may be rendered homeless. </p>

<p>Furthermore, there appears to have developed a trend towards
penalizing innocent property owners, where the government, unable
to succeed in its objectives through its own failed policies, has
begun to shift obligations and responsibilities for eradicating
drug activity to private citizens. For instance, in some
jurisdictions, owners of residential apartment buildings may be
deprived of their property through failure to evict suspected
drug dealers or users, even where the government, with its law
enforcement and prosecutorial powers, has been unable to convict
such individuals of any criminal activity. (66) </p>

<p>In summary, punitive, draconian, and often irrational
approaches to drug policy have, over time, caused unwarranted
encroachments upon the civil rights of those within our borders.
(67) These are often represented by exceptions to rights embodied
in the U.S. Constitution, including rights guaranteed under the
Fourth Amendment and the right of individuals to &quot;due
process of law,&quot; in diverse areas and at various levels of
governmental involvement. (68) </p>

<p>Therefore, to preserve the integrity of government itself,
particularly impacted by our nation's drug policy, we must
reassess our goals (which must be realistic), the purpose and
values implicit in those goals, as well as the means and policies
by which we hope to achieve betterment of our society. In
reassessing the appropriate direction for future drug policy, we
must first acknowledge that a drastic change in thinking and
approach is clearly called for. Our government's continued
pursuit of a failed, punitive policy, which serves not to provide
help and aid to those in need of assistance, but rather, to
&quot;criminalize,&quot; &quot;marginalize&quot; and
&quot;alienate&quot; growing numbers of its population,
ultimately causes more harm than good, garners disrespect for its
institutions, and raises the question of its ability to fairly
and effectively govern. </p>

<p>Accordingly, we must set out on a course to devise a policy
which inspires confidence for positive and meaningful progress in
combating substance abuse, violence, and other related problems
in our society. In embarking on such path, we would do well join
with the medical profession in adherence to the &quot;Hippocratic
oath,&quot; which in its most common form of expression
instructs: <i>&quot;First, do no harm&quot;</i>. </p>

Recommendations</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<h3><a name="recommend1"></a>I. Pursue Alternative Models in
Establishing<br>
Future Drug Policy</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Replace emphasis on <i>&quot;penal&quot;</i> based
        approach to drug policy with &quot;medical&quot; or other
        alternative policy models, which view substance abuse and
        related problems as primarily a <i>public health</i>
        issue. </li>
    <li>Improve and expand drug treatment, vocational support and
        diversionary programs, utilizing extensive cost savings
        derived in transition from cost-intensive
        &quot;penal&quot; based approach to drug policy. </li>
    <li>Adopt a more rational and compassionate approach to drug
        policy, founded upon the humane treatment of substance
        abusers and their families, and placing emphasis on
        assisting those drug users who need treatment in
        obtaining such treatment, rather than emphasizing arrest,
        prosecution and incarceration as a solution. </li>
    <li>Integrate drug treatment centers with other community
        based health facilities, so as to bring substance abusers
        in need of treatment within the health care system. </li>
    <li>Expand methadone maintenance programs and apply resources
        saved in transition from a &quot;penal&quot; based
        policy, to support empirical research on effective
        treatments of substance abuse problems. </li>
    <li>Apply cost-benefit analysis for all drug control policies
        implemented, to ensure that any such policy is unlikely
        to cause more harm than use of the substance(s)
        prohibited. </li>
    <li>Consider alternative drug policy models which would allow
        for government regulation and quality control for
        currently designated &quot;controlled substances,&quot;
        in an effort to further reduce health risks associated
        with purchase and consumption of unsafe adulterated drugs
        from illegal, unregulated drug markets. </li>
    <li>Seriously study and consider alternative drug policy
        models, which attempt to remove huge profits which drive
        the illegal drug trade, in an effort to decrease the
        harms associated with &quot;drug prohibition.&quot; </li>
    <li>For those controlled substances which may be
        &quot;decriminalized,&quot; (e.g., marijuana), replace
        penal sanctions with government regulation and
        appropriate taxation. </li>
    <li>Allow states to experiment with alternative approaches to
        drug policy, including non-penal based models. </li>
    <li>Study alternative drug policies, including experimental
        programs conducted in the U.S. and abroad, in an attempt
        to arrive at the best, most helpful and cost-effective
        system available. </li>
    <li>Develop and encourage pilot programs and alternative
        approaches to substance abuse issues with close
        monitoring. </li>
    <li>Create state and federal commissions, including
        representatives from each of the executive, legislative
        and judicial branches of national and local governments,
        to recommend substantial and cohesive changes in drug
        policy. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend2"></a>II. Provide Immediate Sentencing
Relief and Additional<br>
Judicial Discretion in Criminal Prosecution of Drug Cases</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Repeal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes for
        non-violent drug offenders. </li>
    <li>Revise draconian drug laws, downgrading the category of
        &quot;non-violent&quot; narcotics offenses to levels more
        commensurate with the seriousness of these offenses in
        relation to other crimes. </li>
    <li>Expand judicial discretion in sentencing drug offenders
        on both the state and federal levels, permitting judges
        to sentence individual defendants in a manner suitable to
        the circumstances of the offense and the offender. </li>
    <li>Where appropriate, permit downward modification of
        sentences for &quot;drug mules&quot; and other low-level
        participants in drug transactions. </li>
    <li>Subject to constitutional protections, provide for
        statutory relief for presently incarcerated drug
        offenders, modifying sentences to reflect proposed
        amendments to drug laws. </li>
    <li>To the extent criminalization of use and sale of
        controlled substances remains in place, avoid the present
        system's over-reliance on weight-based criteria in drug
        prosecutions, reserving more serious penalties for sales
        where aggravating factors exist, such as sale to children
        or use of violence in trade. </li>
    <li>Establish and improve diversionary and treatment programs
        and other alternative-to-incarceration programs for
        non-violent drug offenders. Encourage increased
        utilization of probation department resources toward
        facilitating expanded use of such programs by courts in
        sentencing drug offenders.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend3"></a>III. Reduce the Harms Associated
With Substance Abuse<br>
and Drug Prohibition</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Move from policy of &quot;zero tolerance,&quot; to one
        incorporating &quot;harm reduction&quot; principles,
        accepting the reality that marijuana and common
        recreational drugs, and other potentially harmful
        substances (including alcohol and tobacco), have always,
        and will continue to be consumed by some members of
        society, and concentrate efforts on reducing the harms
        associated with such use. </li>
    <li>Adjust policing priorities to concentrate enforcement
        efforts on curtailing and preventing violent criminal
        conduct, rather than emphasis on the apprehension and
        imposition of penal sanctions for use and consumption of
        drugs. </li>
    <li>Reduce the risk of young people coming into contact with
        the &quot;hard&quot; drug market by separating it out
        from the &quot;soft&quot; drug market. </li>
    <li>Expand availability of accurate information and education
        about harms which may be associated with drug use and
        substance abuse and ways to minimize those harms. </li>
    <li>Promote needle exchange programs and repeal drug
        paraphernalia laws, in order to curtail the spread of
        AIDS and other similarly transmitted diseases. </li>
    <li>Initiate measures and revise laws to promote, rather than
        hinder access of substance abusers to medical and other
        care, as may be needed. </li>
    <li>Assure doctor-patient privilege/confidentiality for those
        seeking treatment for substance abuse, pre-natal care and
        other forms of health care, to prevent fear of
        prosecution, removal of children from homes and other
        potential repercussions which discourage individuals from
        utilizing health care facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend4"></a>IV. Concentrate Law Enforcement
Resources on<br>
Reducing Violent Crime and Prosecution of<br>
Violent Criminal Offenders</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Reallocate law enforcement resources currently dedicated
        to the prosecution of non-violent drug offenders, toward
        prosecution of violent crime. </li>
    <li>Concentrate and redirect efforts of police, FBI, and
        other state, local and federal law enforcement agencies
        on investigation and arrest of violent criminal
        offenders. </li>
    <li>Reserve harsh sentencing laws, together with law
        enforcement, prosecution, court and prison resources for
        dealing with violent criminal offenders. </li>
    <li>Reject the notion that law enforcement efforts can
        eliminate drug use in our society, and redirect such
        policing efforts toward concentration on violence and
        community disruption. </li>
    <li>Attempt to eliminate causes of violent crime related to
        the lucrative illicit drug trade, by adopting policies
        which seek to remove huge profits from drug dealing and
        underworld black market narcotics distribution.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend5"></a>V. Reshape the Drug Policy Debate --
Return to<br>
Objective Analysis and Realistic Goals</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Commence objective, rational, non-partisan, and
        interdisciplinary review of current drug policy, with
        emphasis on realistic and appropriate goals to be
        achieved in dealing with problems of harmful drug use and
        substance abuse. Devise reasonable and compassionate
        means of addressing such problems. </li>
    <li>Establish constructive dialogue on drug policy reform,
        taking care to adopt terminology which distinguishes
        between harms caused by substance abuse <i>per se</i> and
        those harms caused by drug control policies themselves. </li>
    <li>Avoid use of the &quot;drug problem&quot; as
        &quot;catch-all&quot; for other societal ailments, in an
        effort to engage in a rational and honest dialogue on the
        development of a responsible drug policy. </li>
    <li>Carefully analyze, for scientific validity, claims of
        causal nexus between use of controlled substances and
        specific criminal activities. </li>
    <li>In analyzing causes of &quot;drug-related&quot; crime,
        identify and distinguish between criminal activity caused
        by: (i) use or abuse of psychoactive substances; (ii) the
        lucrative black-market drug trade; and (iii)
        implementation of current drug policy. Devise realistic
        policies which reduce, rather than perpetuate violence
        and other criminal activity. </li>
    <li>Undertake an accurate, scientific analysis of the
        pharmacological makeup, uses and effects and dangers of
        any given drug (controlled or otherwise), in order to
        inform the determination of a rational and appropriate
        policy for regulation, use and treatment of such drug. </li>
    <li>Evaluate how policies presently employed, with emphasis
        on arrest, prosecution and incarceration, work either to
        provide assistance, or to cause further harm, to those
        individuals who use drugs, their families and
        communities. </li>
    <li>Commence constructive dialogue distinguishing between
        substance abuse and drug use generally, in order to
        develop appropriate and cost-effective goals and policies
        relating to government, medical or other intervention
        into lives of citizens, minimizing involuntary
        intervention absent clear and compelling necessity. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend6"></a>VI. Implement Public Education
Campaign on<br>
Drug Use and Substance Abuse</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Increase access to and availability of accurate
        information about the harms associated with types of drug
        use and of substance abuse. </li>
    <li>Provide access to information about safe use of
        controlled substances, in the absence of abstinence, and
        ways to reduce harms associated with such use. </li>
    <li>Counteract inaccurate, misleading and divisive &quot;drug
        war&quot; propaganda, which has characterized many drug
        education campaigns initiated by advocates of &quot;zero
        tolerance&quot; drug policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend7"></a>VII. Decriminalize Marijuana</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Decriminalize marijuana, accepting that the economic and
        social costs of enforcing penal sanctions for possession
        of this relatively harmless drug can no longer be
        justified. </li>
    <li>If not decriminalized, where medically recommended,
        permit the medical use of marijuana and other controlled
        substances which have been determined by the medical
        community to be therapeutically beneficial.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend8"></a>VIII. Reverse Encroachments on Civil
Rights and<br>
Restore &quot;Due Process of Law&quot;</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Repeal draconian sentencing laws for non-violent drug
        offenses, which deprive individuals of an opportunity to
        contest charges at trial due to risk of extensive and
        unreasonable periods of incarceration. </li>
    <li>In recognition of inherent rights to privacy and personal
        autonomy, reevaluate whether, and to what degree,
        government intervention is appropriate and justifiable
        with respect to casual use of drugs by its citizens. </li>
    <li>Restore a broader application of the U.S. Constitution's
        Fourth Amendment prohibition of unjustifiable search and
        seizure by government, eliminating the &quot;drug
        exception&quot; to the Constitution which has created
        unacceptable invasions of privacy and personal freedom. </li>
    <li>Severely curtail civil forfeiture laws, to permit
        government restraint of property only upon
        &quot;reasonable cause,&quot; and allow for forfeiture of
        only those assets directly traceable to criminal
        transactions, obtained as such with knowledge of the
        owner of the property to be forfeited, and which laws are
        enforceable only upon prior notice and with the
        meaningful right to contest, in accordance with &quot;due
        process of law&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend9"></a>IX. Provide Alternative Social and
Economic<br>
Opportunity for Inner City Youth</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Declare war on causes of substance abuse, including:
        poverty; lack of education; lack of economic opportunity;
        family crises and; financial, emotional and physical
        instability. </li>
    <li>Utilize substantial savings anticipated from moving from
        cost-intensive &quot;penal based&quot; model of drug
        policy, to provide greater educational, vocational and
        recreational opportunities for youth at risk of becoming
        involved in the illegal drug trade. </li>
    <li>Expand and implement affirmative action programs designed
        to increase educational, economic and career
        opportunities for minority youth. </li>
    <li>Encourage public and private investment in poor
        communities to provide greater economic opportunities in
        the legitimate job market.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend10"></a>X. End War on Youth and Inner City
Communities --<br>
Restore Confidence and Integrity in Government</h3>

<ul>
    <li>End discriminatory enforcement of drug laws in inner city
        communities, which fall most heavily on young people of
        color. </li>
    <li>Take measures to reduce violence associated with drug
        prohibition and the lucrative, illicit drug trade it
        fosters. </li>
    <li>Take measures to avoid placing police at &quot;war&quot;
        with inner city youth, as results from current drug laws
        and enforcement policies, and work to build positive
        alliances between police, minority communities and their
        youth. </li>
    <li>Restore confidence in government by having it assist and
        work with those in need, by creation of positive
        vocational, educational, recreational and other programs,
        in place of current emphasis upon arrests, prosecution
        and incarceration which prevails as a result of present
        drug policy. </li>
    <li>Equalize penal sanctions applicable to crack-cocaine
        users and powder-cocaine users, while reducing draconian
        penalties presently applicable to each. </li>
</ul>

1550; <i>also see</i> 21 U.S.C. 802, (regarding federal
criminal classification of presently designated controlled
substances). </p>

<p>Many of the more commonly known controlled substances were not
illegal or &quot;criminalized,&quot; until passage of the
Harrison Act of 1914. Marijuana was banned in 1937. Alcohol was
banned in 1920, although &quot;decriminalized,&quot; by repeal of
the 18th Amendment in 1933. While present drug policy has
statutory &quot;roots&quot; dating back 80 years, we regard
contemporary drug policy, as characterized by the emphasis on
&quot;stepped-up&quot; law enforcement efforts and enhanced penal
sanctions, a more recent development dating back three decades,
to the early 1970's. </p>

<p>2. <i>See</i> <b>National Household Survey on Drug Abuse</b>
(1993), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which
reports that 12% of the total U.S. population, or 24 million
persons within the U.S., had used illicit drugs within the past
year. 77 million persons had used illicit drugs sometime during
their life. In a similar survey, conducted in 1994, it was found
that 10.8% of the total population, or 22.6 million persons had
used illicit drugs some time during the previous year. </p>

<p>Further, a U.S. General Accounting Office report, released in
1989, noted the following findings: that drug abuse in the United
States persisted at very high levels throughout the 1980's; that
the amount of cocaine consumed in the U.S. <i>doubled</i>, while
the price declined about 30%; that the price of heroin declined
20%, while the average purity of heroin sold had doubled; and
that marijuana, while its use declined, continued to be readily
available in most areas of the country. <i>See</i> James
Ostrowski, <i>Thinking About Drug Legalization</i>, <b>Cato
Institute Policy Analysis</b> (1989) at 28. Thus, notwithstanding
huge expenditures in waging the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; (<i>see</i>
Section IIA, <i>infra</i>), drug use remains widespread
throughout the nation, its costs have actually decreased and
potency increased. <i>See also</i>, Joseph B. Treaster, <i>Hospital
Data Show a Rise in Drug Abuse</i>, <b>New York Times</b>, July
9, 1992, at B1, (citing lower costs and greater purity of drugs,
together with more young sellers entering the drug market due to
unemployment, as reasons for upsurge in drug abuse in New York
City. Further reporting on New York State Office of Alcoholism
and Substance Abuse estimate of 200,000 heroin addicts in New
York City alone.) <i>See also</i> Association of the Bar of the
City of New York, <i>A Wiser Course: Ending Drug Prohibition</i>,
49 <b>The Record</b>, No. 5 (1994) at 544. Failures in ability of
U.S. to prevent production and importation of narcotics,
notwithstanding costly efforts, are also well documented. <i>See</i>
E. Nadelmann, <b>Cops Across Borders</b>, (1993). </p>

<p>3. In aid of more meaningful and objective analysis of what
has commonly been referred to as &quot;the drug problem,&quot;
care must be taken and appropriate distinctions made in using
terms such as: &quot;drug use,&quot; &quot;substance abuse,&quot;
&quot;drug-related crime,&quot; and &quot;drug-induced
crime.&quot; Definitions of these terms having been blurred in
the drug policy debate thus far, has led to a failure to properly
analyze and distinguish harms caused by drug use, substance
abuse, the drug-trade, and drug control policies themselves. </p>

<p>4. <i>See &quot;Public Health Consequences of Current Drug
Policy,&quot;</i> Section III, <i>infra</i>. </p>

<p>5. We acknowledge the reality, that forms of drug use and
other potentially harmful behavior have, and always will be,
engaged in by members of our society. Accordingly, we note that
policies based on &quot;zero tolerance&quot; are unrealistic,
unnecessarily harsh, and often counterproductive to reaching
those in need of assistance. </p>

<p>6. Alternative models of drug policy which merit consideration
include those incorporating principles of &quot;harm
reduction,&quot; which have received widespread acceptance among
drug policy experts and by various governments throughout the
world. &quot;Harm reduction&quot; strategies seek to analyze the
phenomenon of substance abuse in society by identifying and
isolating the actual societal harms caused by substance abuse, as
well as policies employed to defeat it, and attempting to reduce
those harms deriving from each. In seeking to reduce harms
associated with drug use, &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategies
include the expansion of needle exchange programs and methadone
clinics, and education on safe drug use for that segment of the
population who will continue to use harmful drugs. Meanwhile,
such policy redirects law-enforcement efforts from attempts to
eradicate all drug use, to concentration in areas where crime and
public disorder continue to occur. We find this approach to be
both more realistic and humane than present
&quot;zero-tolerance&quot; based policy, with all its attendant
costs, marginal results, and questionable use of available
resources. </p>

<p>7. From 1973 to 1993 the total number of inmates held in
prison and jail facilities throughout the U.S. <i>quadrupled</i>.
Having doubled from 1973 to 1983, the years from 1983 through
1993 saw the total number of prisoners held in the U.S. double
once again, from 660,800 to 1,408,685. During this period, the
number of incarcerated drug offenders rose 510%. It is estimated
that in 1990, when the number of individuals incarcerated in U.S.
jails and prison facilities reached 1.1 million, the cost of
incarcerating these individuals was approximately $20.3 billion,
with an anticipated need to <i>double</i> prison facilities in
the federal system. </p>

<p>In some states, such as New York, the figures are even more
startling, New York having seen its inmate population almost <i>triple</i>
during the period from 1981 through 1991. In only six years, from
1983 to 1989, the state saw the annual number of individuals
imprisoned for drug offenses grow 500%. By 1990, felony drug
convictions in New York represented 50% of all felony convictions
handed down by its state courts, up from 11.6% in 1980. As of
1992, New York State anticipated the need for eight new prisons,
at an approximate cost of $220 million to build one prison, and
$22.5 million per year each to operate -- totaling near term
costs of approximately $2.2 billion dollars. <i>See</i> Alan B.
Fischler, <i>The Incarceration of America</i>, <b>N.Y. Law
Journal</b>, November 6, 1992 at 2; Marc Mauer and Tracy Huling, <b>Young

<p>8. In 1991, the U.S. became the leading nation in the rate at
which it incarcerates its people. For instance, by 1991, 445 of
every 100,000 persons in the U.S. were imprisoned, a rate of
incarceration more than 2 to 3 times that of its closest
&quot;competitors&quot;, e.g. Canada and China each at 111 per
100,000, and Japan at 42 per 100,000. <i>See</i> M. Mauer, <b>Americans
Behind Bars: One Year Later</b>, The Sentencing Project (1992). </p>

<p>9. While some economic benefit is admittedly derived in those
communities where new prisons are built and to the corrections
personnel hired to staff these additional facilities, such
&quot;benefits,&quot; nevertheless, represent redirection of
increasingly limited public resources, and involve the much
greater costs associated with warehousing drug offenders. </p>

<p>10. One study noted that 62% of the children of incarcerated
women live more than 100 miles from the correctional facility,
and 47% lived 21-100 miles from the facility; Barbara Bloom, <b>Incarcerated
Mothers and Their Children: Maintaining Family Ties</b>, at
60-64. Overall, 54% of children whose mothers were incarcerated
never visited the prison facility; Barbara Bloom and David

76% of those women had at least one other family member with a
criminal record. 51% of the mothers of those women had felony
arrest records, most of which were drug related. </p>

<p>20. In New York, for example, a parent's substance abuse and
failure to cooperate with treatment is <i>prima facie</i>
evidence of &quot;neglect&quot; for the purposes of Family Court
abuse and neglect proceedings; Family Court Act 1046(a)(iii). </p>

<p>21. For example, New York State law imposes mandatory
reporting requirements on health care professionals, including
medical practitioners, social workers and counselors, requiring
them to report suspected child abuse and neglect to the Child
Welfare Administration. Since substance abuse is deemed a type of
&quot;child neglect&quot; (see note 20, above), this has a
widespread deterrent effect on access to health care by drug
users. With respect to fear of arrest and prosecution of women, <i>see

study found that needle exchange programs are likely to reduce
HIV transmission and do not increase drug use. However, its
recommendations have not been followed because of, what we
believe to be, an irrational adherence to a &quot;zero
tolerance&quot; drug policy. <i>See</i> U.C.S.F. Institute for

Young, concluding, after extensive hearings on the medicinal

therapeutically active substances known to man&quot;); <i>id.</i>
at 6. Nadelmann further reports that, in the 11 states that
decriminalized marijuana during the 1970's, rates of consumption
were indistinguishable from rates in those states that had not;
and that, in the Netherlands, where cannabis was decriminalized
in 1976, consumption among young people had actually decreased
substantially. <i>See also</i> Robert W. Sweet, <i>The Abolition

notes that decriminalization of marijuana would take 850,000
arrests out of the system. </p>

<p>It is also noteworthy, as reported in J. Ostrowski, <i>Thinking

<p>28. It is well established that alcohol causes liver disease
and tobacco is a carcinogen. Additionally, alcohol use and abuse,
when combined with other activities, i.e., operation of a motor
vehicle, has more dangerous effects than most presently illegal
substances. Furthermore, alcohol abuse has been implicated in
increased incidence of violent behavior, including domestic
violence. While not advocating a return to &quot;alcohol
prohibition,&quot; we note that in the case of alcohol,
appropriate sanctions are imposed upon harmful activities
conducted while under the influence of this intoxicant, rather
than punishment for its consumption <i>per se</i>. The
comparative statistics are also quite poignant. Alcohol and
tobacco have been directly implicated in approximately 100,000
and 300,000 deaths per year, respectively. <i>See</i> R. Sweet, <i>The
Abolition of Prohibition -- on Drugs, that is, supra</i>, at 7,
and E. Nadelmann, <i>U.S. Drug Policy: A Bad Export</i>, <b>Foreign
Policy</b>, No. 70, at 92 (Spring, 1988). Meanwhile, according to
the National Council on Alcoholism, only 3,562 people were known
to have died in 1985 from use of all illegal drugs combined,
notwithstanding 1985 having been was one of the highest for <i>per
capita</i> drug consumption. <i>Id.</i> </p>

<p>29. Extensive research in to the potential therapeutic effects
of psychedelics has been conducted by the Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). </p>

<p>30. <i>See</i> L. Grinspoon and J. Bakalar, <b>Marihuana --
The Forbidden Medicine</b>, (1993). </p>

<p>31. In studying the causes of crime, use of the term
&quot;drug related&quot; is often unhelpful and even misleading,
as it fails to distinguish between those crimes actually caused
by drug use or substance abuse (i.e. &quot;drug induced,&quot;
meaning caused by the actual psychotropic experience, or mind
and/or physical alterations brought on by use of illicit drugs),
and those resulting from participation in the violent but
lucrative drug trade under circumstances of drug prohibition,
(i.e., &quot;drug trade&quot; or &quot;drug prohibition&quot;
related crime). </p>

<p>32. A comparable distinction might be made between
&quot;alcohol-induced&quot; crime (e.g., public disorder and
accentuated violent behavior, domestic or otherwise), and
&quot;alcohol trade&quot; or &quot;alcohol prohibition&quot;
related crime brought on by the era of prohibition (1920 to
1933), which included assaults and homicides -- resulting from
turf wars between rival bootleggers, shoot outs with law
enforcement officials, transactions gone bad, etc., extortion,
bribery, and sale of adulterated and poisonous liquor. This is
not to state, however, that all occasions of casual drug use
causes behavior which is harmful or sufficiently serious as to
justify intervention by the state, either by penal or
rehabilitative measures. <i>See</i> Robert W. Sweet and Edward A.
Harris, <i>Just and Unjust Wars: The War on the War on Drugs --
Some Moral and Constitutional Dimensions of the War on Drugs</i>,
(Book Review), <b>Northwestern University L. Rev.</b>, Vol 87,
No. 4, (Summer, 1993). </p>

<p>33. <i>See</i> Testimony of John P. Morgan, Professor of
Pharmacology, City University of New York Medical School, June
1994, at jointly sponsored public hearings of the New York County
Lawyers' Association and the Association of the Bar of the City
of New York. We note, parenthetically, that of the substances
which have been most directly related to violent and other forms
of anti-social behavior, alcohol rates most highly. This is not,
however, a &quot;controlled substance,&quot; as that term is
defined by criminal statutes, nor would the Task Force recommend
a return to &quot;prohibition&quot; of alcohol, based on the
lessons learned from that failed experiment. </p>

<p>34. Certain nations have succeeded in decreasing such
&quot;drug prohibition-related&quot; violence by easing
restrictions on use and, to some extent, on sale of certain
substances which are designated as &quot;controlled&quot; in the
United States. This has decreased, to a degree, the black market
activity and thereby, the cost and violence associated with
illegal drug trade. Examples include: the Netherlands, Australia
and the United Kingdom. </p>

<p>35. We cannot fail to note here that many involved in the drug
trade, particularly in our nation's cities, are not
&quot;hardened criminals,&quot; but rather, minority youth who
are understandably attracted to the possibilities of immediate
economic advancement through participation in the drug trade. For
despite its risks, engagement in the sale of drugs represents one
of the few avenues available to such individuals in a world which
appears to present limited economic opportunity. </p>

Justice Statistics, Bulletin, <i>Prisoners in 1993</i>: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;In 1992 . . . the number of new court commitments
    for drug offenses totaled an estimated 102,000 [up from 8,900
    in 1980, <i>ed.</i>]. The number of persons admitted for drug
    offenses was nearly as large as the number admitted for
    property offenses (104,300) and larger than the number for
    violent offenses (95,300 and public-disorder offenses
    (29,400). An estimated 30.5% of all new court commitments in
    1992 were drug offenders, up from 6.8% in 1980. . . .The
    increase in drug offenders admitted to prison accounted for
    nearly 46% of the total growth in new court commitments since
    1980. . . . The growth in the number of persons arrested for
    drug law violations and the increase in the rate of
    incarceration for drug offenses account for the change in the
    prison offense distribution. Between 1980 and 1992, the
    estimated number of adult arrests for drug law violations
    increased by 108% from 471,200 to 980,700.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The resulting shift in the percentage of drug offenders held
in U.S. prisons and jail, as compared to inmates incarcerated for
other criminal offenses, is as follows: In 1983, the total drug
offenders held in federal prisons represented 27.6% of the total
inmate population. By 1993, this figure rose to 60.8%. During
that same period, the percentage of drug offenders rose in state
prisons from 7.0% to 22.5%, and in local jails from 9.3% to
23.0%. Together with the shift in the makeup of jail and prison
populations, increased drug arrests and commitment of drug
offenders during this period has resulted in a <i>doubling</i> of
the total number of individuals incarcerated in the U.S., from
660,800 in 1983 to 1,408,685 in 1993. This figure <i>quadruples</i>
the number of those incarcerated in the U.S. in 1973, just 20
years ago; M. Mauer and Tracy Huling, <b>Young Black Americans

<p>45. Actually, discussions of &quot;decriminalization&quot; or
&quot;legalization&quot; have always found wide currency,
particularly in present times, due to the overwhelming failure,
at huge cost, of a harsh law enforcement based strategy of drug
control. <i>See</i> Anthony Lewis, <i>End the War</i>, <b>New
York Times</b>, November 3, 1995, at A29; Jefferson Morely, <i>Crack
in Black and White</i>, <b>The Washington Post</b>, November 19,
1995, at C1. Further, we must be mindful that drug prohibition,
in its inception, began just 6 years prior to alcohol
prohibition, by passage of the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914, a
bill with little popular support but urged by then Secretary of
State William Jennings Bryan, a man of &quot;deep prohibitionist
and missionary convictions...'&quot; J. Ostrowski, <i>&quot;Thinking
About Drug Legalization,&quot;</i> <b>Cato Institute Policy
Analysis</b>, No. 121, at 3 (1989). While drug control has taken
on its present character as a serious law enforcement priority
during the past three decades, ironically, this same period has
been one of unprecedented growth for the underworld, illegal drug
industry, in drug usage, and in the expenditure of economic
resources fighting a futile &quot;war on drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>46. M. Mauer and Tracy Huling, <b>Young Black Americans and
the Criminal Justice System: Five Years Later</b>, The Sentencing
Project (October, 1995). This recent report found that although
African Americans represent about 13% of the total population and
13% of those who are monthly drug users, they are 35% of those
arrested for drug possession, 55% of those convicted for drug
possession, and 74% of the total serving sentences of
incarceration for drug possession. <i>See also, 1 in 3 Young
Black Men in Justice System</i>, <b>Washington Post</b>, October
5, 1995, at 1. </p>

<p>47. Such operations are rarely conducted in predominantly
white, middle and upper-class neighborhoods. </p>

<p>48. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 90% of those
convicted in 1994 for federal crack offenses were black and 3.5%
were white. For powder cocaine, 29.7% were black and 25.9% were
white (the rest were Hispanic). Under current federal law, there
is a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment for
possession of 5 grams of crack or 500 grams of powder cocaine.
The Sentencing Commission's recent proposal to remove the
100-to-1 sentencing disparity was rejected by Congress, the
Justice Department and the Clinton Administration. <i>See</i> L.

<p>50. In the five years from 1989 to 1994, black, non-hispanic
women from the ages of 20 to 29, faced the highest growth in
criminal justice &quot;control rates,&quot; (i.e., incarcerated,
on parole or on probation) which increased 78% during this
period. In the five year period from 1986 to 1991, black,
non-hispanic women overall faced the highest growth in numbers of
those incarcerated in state prisons for drug offenses, with an
increase of 828% during this period. <i>See also</i> note 56, <i>infra</i>. </p>

incarceration of women for drug offenses, in 1991, 1 in 3 woman
in state prisons was incarcerated for a drug offense, up from 1
in 8 in 1986. From 1986 to 1991, the number of female state
prisoners incarcerated for drug offenses grew from 2,370 to
12,633, for an increase of 433%. <i>Id.</i> </p>

<p>In criminal statutes, &quot;delivery&quot; of narcotics, with
or without pecuniary compensation, is generally treated under the
more serious category of sale or distribution of such narcotics, <i>(see,
for example,</i> New York State Penal Law 220.00(1), which
defines sale of narcotics as: to &quot;sell, exchange, <i>give or
dispose of to another</i> or offer or agree to do the same.&quot; <i>(Emphasis
added.)</i> Although such criminal prosecutions against women are
not presently known to have been brought in New York State, they
have been, and continue to be brought in various states
throughout the nation, (<i>see</i> <b>Reproductive Freedom News</b>, <i>supra</i>). </p>

<p>64. <i>See</i> S. Wisotsky, <b>A Society of Suspects: The War
on Drugs and Civil Liberties</b>, at 180 (1992). </p>

<p>65. The difficulty of establishing this negative proposition
is borne out by the government's own statistics, which reveal
that the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) made 14,430 domestic
seizures of nondrug property in 1993, resulting in a fiscal
windfall of approximately $670 million; <i>see</i> Drugs &amp;

Actions and Proceedings Law 715, the District Attorney can seek
fines and other sanctions against owners of such properties who
fail to commence eviction proceedings against tenants suspected
of illegal conduct, irrespective of the ability of the District
Attorney to bring or sustain criminal charges with respect to
such tenants. </p>

<p>67. We also note, with great concern, the conduct of various
governments outside our borders, both with and without direction
and encouragement provided by the United States, whose own
policies clearly take on world-wide significance. <i>See, e.g.</i>,
E. Nadelmann, <b>Cops Across Borders</b>, (1993). </p>

compromising the threshold requirement that <i>mens rea</i> be

element in imposing criminal responsibility, <i>see</i> Jack B.

<h1>Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><b>by Tod Mikuriya, M.D.<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report*, comprising some nine
volumes and 3,698 pages, is by far the most completed and
systematic study of marijuana undertaken to date. Because of the
rarity and, perhaps, the formidable size of this document, the
wealth of information contained in it has not found its way into
contemporary writings on this subject. This is indeed
unfortunate, as many of the issues concerning marijuana being
argued in the United States today were dealt with in the Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission Report. </p>

<p>It is both surprising and gratifying to note the timeless and
lucid quality of the writings of these British bureaucrats. It
would be fortunate if studies undertaken by contemporary
commissions, task force committees and study groups could measure
up to the standards of thoroughness and general objectivity
embodied in this report. In the current context of violently
polarized attitudes toward marijuana, the prospect of a study of
similar stature would be improbably if not impossible.<br>
</p>

<p><b>History of British Involvement<br>
</b></p>

<p>The British government in India had substantial knowledge of
intoxicants other than alcohol because of their active
involvement in regulation, taxation and actual trafficking in
these substances for over a hundred years prior to the Hemp Drugs
Commission investigation and report. </p>

<p>In 1790 duties on alcohol and other intoxicant drugs were
first levied by the British on Landlords in India. The regulation
of cannabis preparations was further specified in 1793 in
regulation XXXIV of that year: &quot;No personal shall
manufacture or vend any such drugs (bhang* ganja**, charas*** and
other intoxicating drugs) without a license from the collector of
the zillah_.&quot; </p>

<p>This system of regulation was instituted &quot;with a view to
check immoderation consumption, and at the same time to augment
the public revenue.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1800 in a further modification of regulation, the
manufacture and sale of charas was prohibited as &quot;being of a
most noxious quality,&quot; while daily rates of duty were
declared as the basis for taxing procedures. Curiously, in 1824
the restriction on charas was rescinded &quot;as this drug was
found on examination to be not more prejudicial to health than
ganja or other intoxicating drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1849 limits on retail sale of cannabis drugs were fixed
&quot;for better securing the abkari__ revenue of Calcutta,&quot;
and later extended to the
__________________________________________________________ </p>

<p>* Leaves and flowers of wild growing or inferior cultivated
cannabis plants. </p>

<p>** Flowering tops of the cannabis plant </p>

<p>*** Resin from the mature cannabis plant </p>

<p>_ A county-sized district or administrative division (India) </p>

<p>__ Manufacture or sale of intoxicating Liquors or drugs;
hence, an excise or internal revenue tax on such manufacture of
sale (India) </p>

<p>[Abkar: A wine seller; distiller. Also, one whose trade is
subject to abkari tax]<br>
</p>

<p>whole of Bengal. Four years later the daily tax method was
abandoned and a fee charged on a per weight basis, and in 1860 an
additional set of dealers' fees imposed. </p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that the system of the state of
Bengal was only one of several schemes among the many provinces.
Variations on this approach existed in the other states, a
function of the differing local administrations, reflecting the
degree of administrative and fiscal controls exerted by the
Imperial government. </p>

<p>There had apparently been controversies as to the possible
noxious effects of cannabis drugs, at least from the time of the
inception of British controls on these products, unless we assume
that the initial stated reasons for regulation were merely
cynical rationalizations for obtaining additional sources of
revenue. Within a country of several hundred millions of
inhabitants, divided into hundreds of regions, and with only
rudimentary &quot;homogenizing&quot; forces of effective
transportation and mass media, it is perhaps reasonable to infer
that wide variations in opinions and beliefs would be
encountered.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Formation of the Commission<br>
</b></p>

<p>On 2 March 1893 a question was raised in the British House of
Commons concerning the effects of the production and consumption
of hemp drugs in the province of Bengal, India. In response, the
Government of India convened a seven-member commission to look
into these questions, 3 July 1893. Upon the suggestion of Lord
Kimberley the scope of the investigation was expanded to include
all of India. </p>

<p>Procedures<br>
</p>

<p>The Commission actually met for the first time in Calcutta 3
August 1893. Between this date and 6 August of the following
year, when the study was finished, the Commission received
evidence from 1,455 witness. Field trips were made to thirty
cities in eight provinces and Burma from the end of October 1893
through the latter part of April 1894. Eighty-six meetings for
examination of witnesses transpired during the inquiry. Actual
participation of the members of the Commission was duly noted and
reported -- a custom that it might be worthwhile to revive:<br>
</p>

<p>The following statement shows the attendance of the members of
the Commission during the period occupied in inquiry (3rd August
1893 to April 1894):<br>

<p>29 days </p>

<p>The attendance of Raja Soshi Sikhareswar Roy was broken by
occasional absence caused by ill-health and other reasons. </p>

<p>The absence of Kanwar Harnam Singh during two short periods
was due to ill-health. The prolonged absence of Lala Nihal Chand
was due to the fact that he suffered from continued ill-health,
and was able to be with the Commission only at Calcutta at the
first; then for some part of their preliminary tour, and at a few
meetings for the examination of witnesses during the second tour.
All the members were present at Simla during the preparation of
the report. </p>

<p>Witnesses whose evidence was received by the Commission were
divided into three categories: </p>

<p>(1) Official witnesses able to give information regarding hemp
drugs, based on their official and local experience. </p>

<p>(2) Non-official witnesses of all ranks able to give
information regarding the drugs generally or in connection with
certain classes of the people. </p>

<p>To facilitate collection of information, seventy questions
framed by the Commission were given to witnesses. The written
answers to these questions constituted the bulk of the evidence
before the Commission. Where appropriate, witnesses were examined
orally for further clarification or explanation. In addition,
witnesses who had not submitted written statements were examined
orally. It was duly noted in the record which forms of testimony
had been provided by the individual witnesses.<br>
</p>

<p>The following excerpts discusses evidence received in
testimony and from other sources. Philosophic premises concerning
roles and responsibilities of the individual are outlined as a
prelude to discussing the practical issues of taxation, political
policy, public safety and health. In applying the principles of
English Common Law to peoples in a subcontinent whose beliefs and
customs varied greatly from those of Great Britain, the issues of
feasibility and the common good were of prime concern. If schemes
of regulation of intoxicants followed this rationalistic model
today, the mistakes made then might not require repeating in each
generation. Current technologic advances do not produce progress
in the area of human behavior; they only help to magnify defects
and frailties. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This monumental study exposes the overriding and pervasive
powers of contemporary collective denial and moral failure
underpinning policies of cannabis prohibition. Motivated by
convenient moralism, questions are repeatedly disingenuously
raised concerning the harm of hemp drugs, cannabis, or marijuana.
The engine of agitprop bureaucratic ire fires up. Hearings are
scheduled, witnesses heard, proceedings transcribed, summarized,
presented to the requesting organization, discussed, filed, and
forgotten. The prohibition policies go on. Enforcement,
corrections systems strain under the demands of majoritarian
magical beliefs in coercive powers of Government; promoted by
continuing self-serving Government misinformation and censorship.
From the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission's policy perspective,
today's drug polices would be unthinkable. <br>
</p>

<p>In the century since the resolution passed the British House
of Commons setting up the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission that
resulted in this massive inquiry documented in a nine volume
report there have been drastic changes in public policy in the
United States and Great Britain.<br>
</p>

<p>The Indian hemp drug regulation policies were explicitly
predicated upon optimal and minimal government intervention.<br>
</p>

<p>The subsequent century in the United States, Great Britain,
and Europe has seen pandemic spread of prohibitionist
authoritarian Government interference- the American Disease-
social experiment run amok. <br>
</p>

<p>Income taxes, mass conscription, and two world wars have seen
regression from utilitarian governance of enlightened
non-interference to intrusive majoritarian autocracy.
Authoritative Government has become authoritarian. Less and less
Government justification and demonstrated necessity are needed.
The principle of non-interference is virtually inoperative. The
space of human existence where a person reigns uncontrolled
contracts even further. The large departments of individualistic
human life are contracted or eliminated by laws, public and
corporate policy. <br>
</p>

<p>The second intervention by Government; giving advice and
promulgating information has seen a parallel degradation. From
legitimate and trustworthy dissemination of factual information
through the institutions of science and medicine to censorship,
giving bad advice, dissimulation and deception in the service of
coercion and manipulation. The ensuing chaos of ignorance,
partial truths, and outright lies has produced a cacophonous
toxic confusion surrounding the use of hemp drugs. The font of
contemporary knowledge is now a stinking swamp, hopelessly
poisoned by the ignorant fantasies, fears, and untruths resulting
from prohibitionists' drug propaganda efforts. <br>
</p>

<p>Fifty years after the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report in
America the New York Mayor's Committee on Marihuana reported on
use of the drug after a five year study, seven years after
national marijuana prohibition. The perspective was based on the
premise that departments of human life and individual circle with
uncontrolled reign did not include the right to use marihuana.
The authoritative Government intervention of Prohibition is now
accepted; the non-interference principle of the Millsean Indian
Hemp Drugs Administration policy; dead- a luxury enjoyed,
ironically, by people of India subjugated by the British
imperium.<br>
</p>

<p>Descriptions of marihuana use were now from the perspective of
studying the characteristics of the users of this illicit drug:
to what extent, method of distribution, attitude of smoker toward
society and use of the drug, relationship with eroticism, crime,
and juvenile delinquency. Discussions of legitimacy of Government
intervention are by implication discussing the relative
dangerousness of marihuana. The legitimacy of Prohibition as a
social policy was neither justified nor discussed. Religious use
or freedom is not mentioned.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad that the sociological, psychological, and
medical ills commonly attributed to marihuana have been found to
be exaggerated insofar as the City of New York is concerned. I
hasten to point out, however, that the findings are to be
interpreted only as a reassuring report of progress and not as
encouragement to indulgence, for I shall continue to enforce the
laws prohibiting the use of marihuana until and if complete
findings may justify an amendment to existing laws.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In the 1970 revision in Government marihuana prohibition
policy generated another report in 1972: Marihuana: a Signal of
Misunderstanding- First Report of the National Commission on
Marihuana and Drug Abuse. <br>
</p>

<p>Individual rights are at least discussed in order to be
heavily discounted:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;So, while we agree with the basic philosophical precept
that society may interfere with individual conduct only in the
public interest, using coercive measures only when less
restrictive measures would not suffice, this principle merely
initiates inquiry into a rational social policy but does not
identify it. We must take a careful look at this complicated
question of the social impact of private behavior. And we must
recognize at the outset the inherent difficulty in predicting
effects on the public health and welfare, and the strong
conflicting notions of what constitutes the public
interest.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Religious freedom&quot; as currently delineated by the
Government places the burden on the individual to pass certain
&quot;tests&quot; to prove that hemp drugs used for sacramental
purposes:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Cases dealing with religious freedom in other contexts
have isolated three distinct foci of inquiry when a law is
challenged as violative of the &quot;free exercise&quot; clause:
(1) Is the claimant's belief and practice really a
&quot;religion&quot; within the meaning of the First Amendment?
(2) If so, is the practice prohibited by the challenged statute
essential to the practice of the &quot;religion?&quot; (3) Even
if the answers to (1) and (2) are yes, is there nevertheless a
sufficiently compelling state interest to warrant overriding the
practice? Only when the proscribed activity is essential to a
qualified &quot;religion&quot; and the state's interest is not
overwhelming will the courts invoke the First Amendment to
invalidate an otherwise permissible legislative
proscription.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In the 1989 Carl Olsen, a white Rastafarian and director of
Iowa NORML unsuccessfully attempted a religious freedom defense
for charges of marijuana selling and importation for distribution
to other members of the Ethiopian Coptic Zion Church.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;If the 'compelling interest' test is to be applied...it
must be applied across the board, to all actions thought to be
religiously commanded... Any society adopting such a system would
be courting anarchy.... The rule respondents favor would open the
prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from
civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind- ranging from
compulsory military service....to the payment of taxes.....drug
laws.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Dutifully crafted by Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, now on the
supreme court, no question of how authoritative interference of
Government is accepted to be appropriate public policy. Religious
freedom is now restricted to activity that must be asserted and
proven rather than assumed. Proving compelling interest has
switched from the Government to the individual.<br>
</p>

<p>Departments of human life were seen not to be imperiously
guarded for the individual but regarded with mistrust and source
of opportunities for dissent against public policy. At the height
of the Vietnam war marijuana use was strongly identified with the
growing student antiwar resistance.<br>
</p>

<p>The non-intervention principle is at least recognized but the
departments of individuality and circle around the individual
were routinely stepped over by Government with justification in
this case for national security. Militarism preempted any
considerations of individual rights of privacy. Departments of
human life were small and confined to cosmetic obligatory
institutional ritual displays in the context of growing public
resistance to the American military industrial behemoth run amok
in southeast Asia.<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the cautious conclusion of the Commission to
critically examine the policies of marijuana prohibition, the
report was conspicuously rejected sight unseen by then president
Richard M. Nixon to demonstrate his being &quot;tough on
crime&quot; in a presidency struggling to end the Vietnam war. <br>
</p>

<p>Twenty-two years later on the centennial of the Indian Hemp
Drugs Commission Report finds the principle of Government
non-interference is an all but forgotten faded idealistic icon,
given hollow obeisance at state ceremonies, a quaint
philosophical curiosity of the past. The circle around the
individual is reduced to a pale, flaccid, tattered, transparent,
and permeable membrane. Intrusion is limited only by available
funding to Government interference. The worsening of the balance
of power between the individual and state has increased by an
order of magnitude, facilitated by advances in technology. <br>
</p>

<p>Toqueville in his prophetic Democracy in America warns of
dangerous forms of despotism in democratic, egalitarian America: <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;A great many persons of the present day are quite
contented with this sort of compromise between administrative
despotism and the sovereignty of the people; and they think they
have done enough for the protection of individual freedom when
they have surrendered it to the power of the nation at large.
This does not satisfy me: the nature of him I am to obey
signifies less to me than the fact of extorted obedience.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free
agency of man less useful and less frequent; it circumscribes the
will within a narrower range and gradually robs a man of all the
uses of himself. The principle of equality has prepared men for
these things; it has predisposed men to endure them and often to
look upon them as benefits.<br>
</p>

<p>After having thus successively taken each member of the
community in its powerful grasp and fashioned him at will, the
supreme power then extends its arm over the whole community. It
covers the surface of society with a network of small complicated
rules, minute and uniform, through which the most original minds
and most energetic characters cannot penetrate, to rise above the
crowd. The will of the man is not shattered, but softened, bent,
and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are
constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy,
but it prevents existence, it does not tyrannize, but it
compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till
each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid
and industrious animals, of which the government is the
shepherd.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Attacked by oaths of &quot;drug free,&quot; informers
(including children), undercover police, drug-sniffing dogs,
random and warrantless searches, child snatching, drug testing,
forfeiture of property, surveillance of bank, business,
electricity, and other records, the departments of human life
wither. The parts of human life considered reserved territory are
noticeably smaller- the individual, society and
&quot;civilization&quot; suffer the loss.<br>
</p>

<p>Review of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report is important
for perspective in assessing the legitimacy and direction of
contemporary Government drug policy in a democratic society.
Froude's theorem of functional governance: &quot;no laws are of
any service which are above the working level of public morality,
and evasion.&quot; was of importance to feudal England, the
Indian Hemp Drugs Commission in 1894 and a century later a public
policy issue of prime magnitude. <br>

<p align="center">INDIAN HEMP AND THE DOPE FIENDS OF OLD ENGLAND </p>

<p align="center"><b>A sociopolitical history of cannabis and the
British Empire 1840-1928</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Sean Blanchard &amp; Matthew J. Atha MSc</b></p>

<p>When the report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission (IHDC)
reached 1890's England it met official and public apathy. There
was no political debate. It went into the 'forget about this'
file on arrival and has stayed there ever since. There was no
publicity; The news that &quot;Ganja is not appreciably
harmful&quot; was of no concern to the majority of users, who
took cannabis products for their medical benefits. The
non-medical users were mostly artists who didn't <u>mind </u>a
little harm. Prohibitionist sentiment was concentrated on the
opium trade between India and China and on alcohol at home.
Cannabis use in England was considered negligible, and the
authorities were content to have no laws at all controlling <b>it
</b>for another thirty years.<br>
</p>

<p>When laws were later proposed, the Government paid no
attention to the evidence in their possession from the IHDC. In
India, the recommendations of the IHDC report for control by
taxes rather than prohibition went into force quietly,
standardising laws and tariffs on cannabis in all the provinces.
In March 1895, the Indian Government passed a resolution after
reviewing the report. It said that for the last twenty years
their policy had been of &quot;restraining use and improving the
revenue by the imposition of suitable taxation&quot; and
&quot;imposing as high a rate of duty as can be levied without
inducing illicit practices&quot; on the grounds that &quot;the
best way to restrict the consumption of drugs is to tax
them...&quot; So, &quot;to that policy the Governor-General...
has decided steadily to adhere.&quot;[1]<br>
</p>

<p>There was never any suggestion that the same rules might be
applied in the UK; the Empire didn't work like that. The
Governor-General (also known as Viceroy), Lord Landsdowne, was
appointed by the UK Government. When they instructed him to
commission a report, he did so, then accepted or rejected it,
passed any regulations needed, and told the UK what he'd done.
His job was to 'keep natives in their place' and help the British
get on with de, not to give advice on home affairs.<br>
</p>

<p><b>From Mother's Friend to Opium Wars<br>
</b></p>

<p>Cannabis was virtually irrelevant to 19th century England. The
drug of the century was opium, freely available to the British
population and so popular that the government went to war to
prevent the prohibitionist Chinese disrupting the trade. The
opium wars still write their history in the 1990s, as Britain is
soon due to hand back Hong Kong, the territory it won from China
and those territories leased for 150 years, in 1997.<br>
</p>

<p>Thomas De Quincy, in his 'Confessions of and English Opium
Eater' gave the first popular account of the '...marvellous
agency of opium, whether for pleasure or pain'. He may have been
the first glamouriser of the psychotropic effects of the drug,
but, for most people opium was a friend and medicine as
indispensable as aspirin or Valium in the 20th century. Godfrey's
cordial, or chemists' home-brewed versions of popular patent
medicines, were used to quiet children, while no home would be
without laudanum (alcoholic tincture of opium). Opium was first
used in the treatment of cholera in the epidemics of the early
19th century, and continued to be used for the treatment of
diarrhoea and sickness, common complaints in the less <u>than </u>hygienic
environment of the day. It was during the Crimean war that the
analgesic effects were fully exploited, and it is certain that
the widespread use of laudanum, Collis Browne's mixture or other
opium-based medicines, available to the poor for a penny a
bottle, enabled ordinary people to cope with the harsh realities
of life in Dickensian England. From the government's point of
view, it was no doubt preferable to have the poor in a state of
comfortable stupor than rioting on the streets.<br>
</p>

<p>India was not the main source of opium for the domestic
market. Most of this was grown in Turkey or Persia (Iran), as
this opium was of generally high qualify, and trade flourished in
the period following the end of the Napoleonic wars, particularly
after the treaty of Balta Limon (1838) granting the Ottoman
Empire 'most favoured nation' trading status[2]. Indian opium,
however, was responsible for one of the British Government in
India becoming the largest drug-trafficking syndicate in the
world during the latter part of the century.<br>
</p>

<p>Opium and tea were the mainstays of the British East India
Company, who had a monopoly on the opium produced in Bengal. In
1772 Warren Hastings, then chief executive of the company,
realised the potential for foreign revenue in exporting Indian
opium to China. Opium had been known in China for centuries, but </p>

<p>imports bad been banned in 1729 by decree of the Emperor. An
foreign trade was funneled through Canton, opium being smuggled
with legitimate consignments in British ships, and sold through
corrupt officials to an eager market Other traders smuggled opium
to China overland, and the consumption spread to all levels of
society, even to the personal retinue of the Emperor. Exports to
China rose from 10,000 chests ill 1820 to 40,000 chests in 1840.
By 1836, a Chinese official in Canton, Hsu Nal-chi, petitioned
the emperor to legalise the trade after witnessing the failure of
prohibition... &quot;the severer the interdicts against (opium)
became, the more widely do the evils therefrom spread.&quot; He
was summarily dismissed from his post and replaced with a
committed &quot;war on drugs&quot;-minded individual, Lin
Tse-hsu.<br>
</p>

<p>Lin was determined to wipe out the opium trade by threatening
the British merchants with the loss of the tea trade, and in 1839
forced them to surrender 20,000 chests of the drug. Captain
Charles Elliot the British Chief Superintended, retaliated by
ordering all British ships out of the Canton estuary,
transferring the tea trade to American ships who would transport
their cargoes to Hong Kong, an inconvenience, but not an
obstacle, to the trade. Instead of using Canton, smugglers would
take opium consignments ashore up and down the coast in sinall
boats, fast enough to evade the Customs craft. Meanwhile Elliot
had ordered an expeditionary force of naval steamships which
arrived in 1840 and put direct pressure on Peking. Lin was
dismissed and the trade continued uninterrupted following the
Chinese capitulation and the end of the first opium war in 1842.
To the domestic audience in the UK, Palmerston, the Prime
Minister, bad portrayed the war as an attempt to force the
Chinese to accept free trade. In reality, the only commodity
directly involved was -opium, tax revenue from which was becoming
increasingly important to the Indian Government [3]. <br>
</p>

<p>In Britain, the Conservative opposition was not satisfied with
Palmerston's explanations and they opposed the opium trade in the
1840 Commons debate. By the time they took power in 1841 their
tune had changed, and the trade continued to expand. The Chinese
government was effectively warned that no British ships should be
searched. Although fresh edicts against the drug were issued by
the Chinese, they were powerless to stop the trade following the
treaty of Nanking, which ceded Hong Kong to Britain, allowing a
bridgehead for further opium supplies. In 1856, following growing
and-British sentiment, the Chinese gave the British government a
further excuse for war by seizing the <i>Arrow, </i>a British
vessel with a crew of Chinese criminals anchored off Canton. The
fact that the <i>Arrow's </i>registration had expired,
technically justifying the Chinese action, was overlooked by
Palmerston, once again the Liberal Prime Minister after fighting
an election forced by government defeat on an opposition motion
condemning the war, and winning on a wave of patriotic fervour.<br>
</p>

<p>Lord Elgin was dispatched with an expeditionary force which
burned down the Summer Palace in Peking to impress upon the
Emperor the need to keep agreements. The main consequence of the
Second Opium War was that China was forced to legalise the trade
in opium, and were only permitted to tax the product at a level
acceptable to the British. Consumption increased from 60,000
chests in 1860 to 105,000 by 1880. The trade generated taxes to
the British Indian Government equivalent to over half their total
revenue, enough to cover the entire civil service and armed
forces budgets. In this climate, financial expediency, as so
often is the case, took precedence over the growing moral
arguments against the drug trade. <br>
</p>

<p>Following increased public pressure to end the trade, and in
response to a Parliamentary motion, the Government called a Royal
Commission on the production and consumption of opium, which was
only to consider prohibition among other options, after full
investigation. It was during these manoevres that the IHDC was
also established. The Indian Viceroy, Lord Lansdowne was against
anything that might disrupt business. Prime Minister Gladstone
was much more pro trade than he was anti drug. They packed the
opium commission with pragmatists from the Indian Civil Service,
with some of the more economically literate abolitionists, and
ensured that it would concentrate a good deal on money. It first
met in September 1893 and saw 2,500 witnesses by February '94.<br>
</p>

<p>When the report was published in '95, it said that opium was
&quot;generally used in moderation&quot;, and &quot;led to no
evident ill-effects&quot;. Even some senior anti-opiumists had
been convinced. The fact that Chinese missionaries were
overwhelmingly critical of the effects of opium, in contrast to
the Indian witnesses who were predominantly favourable towards
the drug, was put down to the fact that in India the drug is
normally taken orally, whereas in China it was generally smoked
[3]. There was only one dissent; Joseph Rowntree, one of the
committee members, was later to denounce the Commission's report
as a whitewash. By that time there was another election under
way. Prohibition had no chance under the Conservatives, and there
would be no Liberal government until 1905.(4). The government,
despite public opinion, was determined to continue the opium<br>
</p>

<p><b>&quot;The Lunatic asylums are filled with Ganja
Smokers.&quot; <br>
</b></p>

<p>The question of cannabis occasionally cropped up as an
incidental issue in skirmishes during the long legislative battle
against the opium business. As early as 1840 the pro-opium banker
William Bingham Baring MP told the Commons that if the opium
trade were suppressed then there would be a danger of users
turning to drugs &quot;infinitely more prejudicial to physical
health and energy than opium&quot;. Baring, one of 10 MPs of both
parties from the same pro-free trade family, was particularly
concerned about &quot;an exhalation of the Hemp plant, easily
collected at certain seasons, which is in every way more
injurious than the use of the poppy.&quot; [3] This was another
justification for the lucrative opium trade which flourished in a
climate of official and unofficial governmental encouragement.
However, attitudes were slowly changing and in 1875 Mark Steward
MP had proposed that the Indian Governor General be instructed to
investigate the opium trade &quot;with a view to gradual
withdrawal,&quot; and lost by 37 votes. Similar moves were
regularly defeated for the next twenty years. By April '91, a
spokesman for the Society for Suppression of the Opium Trade
(SSOT) had obtained a 30-vote majority for a motion that the
Governments' revenue from opium was &quot;Morally
indefensible&quot;.<br>
</p>

<p>On 16 July 1891 Stewart asked a three part question about
ganja [5]:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;i Whether the Secretary of State for India has seen a
report in the Allahabad Pioneer of 10 May that ganja, which is
grown sold and excised in much the same way as opium, is far more
harmful, and that &quot;the lunatic asylum of Bengal are filled
with ganja smokers.&quot; </p>

<p>ii Is he aware that<b> </b>ganja has been made illegal in
Lower Burma and that excise reports say this has been 'of
enormous benefit to the people.' </p>

<p>iii Will he call to the attention of the Governor General the
desirability of extending theprohibition to other
provinces?&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The answers to which were yes, yes, and that he would
&quot;Enquire whether further steps should be taken to limit
consumption...&quot; On 7 August 1892 those enquiries were
answered at some length. The Viceroy's office told London that
the whole question had been extensively discussed with provincial
administrations in 1871-73. They sent 174 pages of old dispatches
from Indian provincial governments to the centre, and from there
to London. After considering these, &quot;The Governor General is
of the opinion that while ganja may be among the most noxious of
all intoxicants commonly used in India... even if absolute
prohibition could be enforced, the result might be to induce the
use of more noxious drugs&quot; (e.g. datura). Apart from which
it would be impossible to enforce a prohibition. It was &quot;Our
duty to restrict consumption, but unnecessary to do more than
persevere in the policy established In 1873.&quot; These papers
languished unread in London, perhaps because there was a general
election going on.<br>
</p>

<p>The 1873 dispatches showed the pragmatism of imperial
administrators which was to be repeated by the IHDC, in very
similar words. The then Viceroy had said that while the
Government should endeavour to restrict the use of ganja, it
would be impossible to enforce general prohibition, especially
because of religious feelings in some groups and because the
plants grew freely some areas. It would be inexpedient to order
what could not be enforced... &quot;It does not appear to the
Governor-General to be specifically proved that hump incites to
crime more than other drugs or spirits.&quot; There was also some
evidence that hump, &quot;usually so noxious&quot;, might
usefully be taken for medical reasons. There was no doubt that
habitual use tended to cause insanity but not in very many cases
relative to the numbers of the insane.(6]. &quot;General opinion
seems to be that the evil effects of Ganja have been
exaggerated.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The dispatches from regional governments were more forthright.
The Lt.-Governor of the Punjab wrote that considering the
practicalities, they should not restrict hemp drug use unless
there was proof of connection with crime. Civil, police and
medical officers disagreed on the details but: &quot;His Honour
is of the opinion that if people were prohibited from using
preparations of hemp or opium, they would, in all probability,
have recourse to some other stimulant, such as alcohol, the crime
resulting from the use of which would be much greater than that
resulting from the abuse of these drugs .... It seems that the
amount of crime, violent or other, incited by ganja, is
exceedingly small... If, therefore, these preparations have no
effect on crime and only injure the persons who use them, it is
difficult to see in what manner the law can restrict their use in
a country where opium is a monopoly of the Government, the
effects of which are perhaps as injurious when taken in excess as
those of hemp.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>The local governments of Mysore, Hyderbad, Oudh, and Burma
said that as hump drugs were little used locally, not necessary.
Central Provinces sent plenty of data but no opinions. The
Northwest Provinces (later Pakistan), one of the main cannabis
growing areas, said the evidence on crime was confused, where if
the situation was bad as supposed there would surely be a
consensus. To stop production would be almost impossible, so they
could not recommend attempts to limit or stop consumption.
Bombay, Madras, and Bengal said that restrictions and taxes
already in place should be preserved. All agreed excessive use to
be somehow connected with physical harm and perhaps insanity, but
the numbers harmed were very small. Bengal sent the most
information. Asked if a particularly popular type of local ganja
was more deleterious than others, they submitted a long report on
cultivation, uses and profit margins on all hemp products by Dr
Watt, State Reporter on Economic Products. Their local product
was popular due to the quality of plants and traditional
production skills, rather than sheer strength. A table of samples
analysed for &quot;Resinous extracts or Cannabin&quot; ranged
from 1.4% (NW Province) to 12% (Madras), mostly about 4% [7]. All
of the legal trade was inside India. The state of Bengal had been
making an average 1 million rupees per year through the 1860's in
tax on ganja shops and duty at government auctions, about
100,000 - tens of millions in today's money.<br>
</p>

<p>When these papers were taken from the files, twenty years
after they were written, the August 1892 elections were under
way. The Conservatives went out and the Liberals came in. Drug
control was not high on their agenda; however, the new Home
Secretary, Foreign Secretary, and Secretary of State for India
were all known to be anti-opium, and the Prime Minister had
spoken out against it in the past. The prohibitionists knew they
might get some sort of opium control agreed if it didn't oppose
the Liberals' central Free Trade policy. Believing their moment
had come, they began to quarrel among themselves.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Criminalise it!<br>
</b></p>

<p>Before the development of the hypodermic syringe by Alexander
Wood, the main concern about opium was not the threat of
addiction, but the danger of poisoning. Only after the 1860s did
the risk of dependency start to cause concern among the medical
profession. Certainly, people would have been habituated to the
drug, but the stereotype of the drug addict had yet to gain
acceptance within the UK. Even where individuals wrote of their
habit, such as a chemists wife who had been using morphia for 30
years, described her experience in a matter of fact way, free
from any sense of stigma her major concern being the perceived
tendency of the drug to cause her to put on weight. Although the
dependency syndrome had been described two centuries earlier by
Thomas Sydenham, the risk was not taken seriously by most medical
practitioners. Following increasing reports of dependency
symptoms after 1860, culminating in a series of articles in <i>The
Practitioner </i>in<i> </i>1870, the debate on the wisdom of
permitting free access to opium accelerated. In 1878 Edward
Levinstein in Germany started the 'moral' argument about the
effect of opium on the character of the user, and was one of the
first to promote abstinence as a cure for the addict [2].<br>
</p>

<p>From the 1840s on, there were several anti-opium
organisations, all small and mostly broke. Their memberships
overlapped, but the leaders didn't get on well. None of them had
ever tried to gain mass support. The first organisation to come
out against the trade were the Birmingham Quakers. In 1869, Lord
Shaftesbury urged the Indian government to withdraw from its
monopoly position in the trade. By 1884 the Society for the Study
and Cure of Inebriety, founded by Sir Norman Kerr, aimed &quot;to
educate the professional and the public mind to the dangers of
intemperance&quot;. At that time, alcohol was the main target for
the temperance movement, whereas other, more exotic drugs were
not seen as much of a threat to respectable Britons. These drugs
were not expected to be a threat to the well-adjusted British
gentleman, and habituation among the Chinese and others was
regarded as the kind of 'filthy foreign habit' that should be
stopped for the foreigners' own good. Kerr recognised the dangers
of opium with a crusading zeal, and railed against its use,
denying any possibility that some persons could be able to
restrict their use to a moderate level. The Society for
Suppression of the Opium Trade (SSOT), founded in 1874, became
the best-known anti-opium organisation, but had always been
elitist, controlled by Quaker businessmen with knighthoods,
funded by one family. Their best argument combined economic and
humanitarian interest; other exports to China had been damaged by
the sleaziness of the opium business. Trade with China had been
stagnant between 1860-80 while business with Japan had tripled.
The SSOT moved for ending the India-China opium trade, and an
enquiry into alternate ways of making up the money. They took too
long agreeing a proposal with other lobbyists, but did manage to
force the government to concede the 1893 Royal Commission on
Opium [8].<br>
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in February '93, William Caine, MP (Bradford East),
had the papers on ganja collected the previous year placed in the
House of Commons Library. 0u the 2nd March 1893 he put a public
question to the Under-secretary of State for India. &quot;If he
will instruct the Government of India to create a commission of
experts to enquire into and report on the cultivation of and
trade in all preparations of hemp drugs in Bengal, the effects of
theft consumption on society, and on the moral condition of the
people, and the desirability of prohibiting its growth and
sale.&quot; Would he also invite written reports on the same
matters from all other provinces, and include in the commission
non-official natives of India. The Secretary of State would ask
the Viceroy to do just that, &quot;and he will be glad if the
result of this inquiry is to show that further restriction can be
placed upon the sale and consumption of these drugs.&quot;(7)
Since the Government seemed so amenable, a secondary question by
the Right Hon. Sir Charles E. Schwann, Bart, was then dropped.<br>
</p>

<p>The members of the commission were named on 3rd July, and held
their first meeting on 2nd August - a mouth before the Opium
commission began to meet. They continued until April, seeing over
800 witnesses, assembling over 3000 pages into seven volumes, and
a confidential extra volume on hemp drug use in the Army; then
the Finance and Commerce department of the Government of India
considered the report, and another British election crept closer.
It is unclear what Caine and Schwann thought they were up to.
Both were Liberals, Temperance campaigners, and probably
anti-opium. Schwann had a safe scat, a comfortable merchants'
fortune and radical opinions. Caine wrote books, including 'Young
India', 'Picturesque India' and 'A Trip Around the World.' He had
quit the Liberal Party six years earlier over the Irish question,
and been re-admitted in a new scat after losing as an
Independent; he was to lose it again in 1895. The timing, and the
request for the commission to include non-official Indians,
suggest that they were part of a faction among the
anti-opiumists, perhaps trying to stir them into holder demands
or quicker action. Perhaps they were simply trying to get in on
what looked like a winning side. Neither is recorded as ever
mentioning hemp drugs in public again.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The Dope Fiends of Old England<br>
</b></p>

<p>The international drugs trade was quite a different thing from
home consumption; for example although the British Empire
produced a great deal of the worlds' opiates, over 80% of the
opium used in the UK was from Turkey and Persia [2]. The economic
pressure for international prohibition came from traders and
nations with rival products. In the UK drug control was at first
pan of an increase in medical involvement in social policy.
Prescription by professionals had to take over from
self-medication before complete prohibition became possible.<br>
</p>

<p>There was not much openly recreational drug use in Victorian
England, other than alcohol. A few serf consciously
unconventional young artists and mystics searched for inner
experience, rejecting vulgar materialism, but the majority of
drug abusers, then as now, considered themselves to be taking
medicines, to help them work or relax. This was an age which
demanded refinement, in every sense of the term. They took
extracts, tinctures, distillations or the 'active ingredients' of
traditional medicinal plants like Indian hemp or poppies, in
amounts that would kill modern addicts. This was all for the good
of their health, so morally impeccable. They didn't do dope to
get wasted, or didn't admit to it<br>
</p>

<p>Vulgar materialism provided ever more purified forms of relief
from the stresses of righteous life, as opium was dissolved into
laudanum, concentrated into morphine, re-concentrated into
heroin. Some condemned booze while chewing opium, just as
well-known modern anti-drug campaigners have been tranquilliser
addicts. In this atmosphere Cannabis Indica was just another
potentially useful plant, which could be perhaps refined into
some sort of medicine but was quite unsuitable in natural form.
The distinction between drug use and abuse had hardly been
invented. Doctors were expensive and not well trusted, so the
poor dosed themselves with whatever remedies they could afford.
Pseudo-medical opiate use was decreasing, but still respectable;
Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Florence Nightingale had used it,
and William Wilberforce, saint of the anti-slavery movement, had
eaten twelve grains a day for thirty years. Self-medication
bluffed into non-medical use. Boozing was low class and
unfeminine, so respectable ladies took &quot;tonics.&quot; Patent
medicines were a huge business, often including alcohol, opium,
or cannabis.<br>
</p>

<p>Sales of pure morphine, cocaine, and barbiturates were
supposedly controlled by the 1868 Poisons and Pharmacy Act, but
quack nostrums and patent medicines were not, and an attempt to
extend the law in 1884 had failed. The Act only affected shops,
not users. One especially dangerous popular remedy was Collis
Brownes' Chlorodyne, containing chloroform and morphine, which
the British Medical Association campaigned through the 90's to
have banned.<br>
</p>

<p><b>&quot;One of the most valuable medicines we possess&quot; <br>
</b></p>

<p>There had been increasing medical interest in cannabis since
William O'Shaughnessy described the use of indian hemp as
medicine and intoxicant [9], relying on accounts of hashish use
from ancient Persian and Arabic sources, as well as on his own
observations in India. He described the use of hemp in the
treatment of rheumatism, hydrophobia, cholera, tetanus and
infantile convulsions, as well as describing the delirium induced
by continued use. O'Shaughnessy had written in 1839 that, with a
couple of exceptions, &quot;I have been unable to trace any
notice of the employment of this drug in Europe.&quot; However,
despite citing western works by Ainslie and von Estebeck he
managed to overlook one classic account. <br>
</p>

<p>The noted medieval herbalist, Nicholas Culpepper (1616-1654),
listed a variety of medical uses of the common european hemp
(Cannabis sativa), including anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and
antiparasitic activity [10]. Culpepper made no mention of the
psychotropic activity, although the temperate hemp he described
would normally be of low drug content and be grown for fibre.
Culpepper's work would have owed much to the folk herbalism used
by British witches, or wise women, who until the christian
persecutions had provided most primary health care to the rural
population, as well as to the monastic healers who replaced them.
By the Victorian &quot;age of reason&quot; most traditional use
had been suppressed, as the pioneer pharmacologists began to
analyse folk medicines to refine and extract the active compounds
therein. An unsuccessful attempt had been made in the 1840's to
grow hemp for medicine in the London suburb of Mitcham.
Experimenters used it for athsma and other chest problems,
sleeplessness especially in cases of opiate or alcohol
withdrawal, and with opium and bromide of potassium in treating
insanity.<br>
</p>

<p>One reason why cannabis was not as widely used as opium
products, or the newer chemical remedies, was the difficulty
found refining an &quot;active ingredient.&quot; There were
problems getting supplies of reliable strength, confusion about
apparently different products from the same plant, and
uncertainty about its effects in the body. However, it was used
to treat many disorders. In 1889, Dr E.A.Birch described in the
Lancet the successful use of cannabis indica in the treatment of
chloral hydrate and opium withdrawal, drawing attention to the
abolition of craving and the antiemetic (vomit suppressing)
effects and the stimulation of appetite in patients who would not
normally eat, or keep down, their food [111. Queen Victoria's
personal physician, J.R. Reynolds described it in 1890 as
&quot;One of the most valuable medicines we possess.&quot; In
another Lancet article published in 1890, he described the use of
cannabis indica for treating insomnia in the senile, alcoholic
delirium, neuralgia, migraine, spastic paralysis, and convulsions
[12]..He allegedly prescribed tincture of cannabis to Queen
Victoria herself for the treatment of menstrual cramps. Cannabis
tincture and an extract made from resin were available from Peter
Squire of Oxford St in 1864, and wholesale through the Society of
Apothecaries by 1871. Chemists extracted stuff they called
cannabene, cannabin tannin, cannabinnene etc. but had no idea
which, if any, was the &quot;active ingredient&quot; until
cannabinol was isolated in 1895. <br>
</p>

<p>At the same time some thought of drug-taking as a form of
poisoning, and some researchers proposed that it either caused,
or was, a type of insanity. W.W. Ireland compared the mental
state of cannabis users to delirium, with its alteration of time
and space and visual illusions. British doctors' reports from
Cairo Asylum in 1894 linked violent insanity with
&quot;Hashism&quot;(13,14) Some of the medical studies would have
been recreational use in any other context. Walter Dixon must
have tried it on himself as well as small furry animals when he
showed in 1899 that the effects vary according to type of
preparation as well as method of ingestion. He recommended
smoking for immediate effect and wrote in the British Medical
Journal, &quot;Hemp taken as an inhalation may be placed in the
same category as coffee, tea and kola. It is not dangerous and
its effects are never alarming, and I have come to regard it in
this form as a useful and refreshing stimulant and food
accessory, and one whose use does not lead to a habit which grows
upon its votary.&quot; He was to be a member of the Rolleston
Committee on Morphine and Heroin Addiction in the 1920's, who
opposed criminalising narcotics policy.<br>
</p>

<p>At the end of the century cannabis tincture became popular
again as a cure for cramps, migraine, opium addiction, withdrawal
and insomnia, but the fashion faded. In the early 1900's a
British Medical Association campaign against 'Secret Remedies'
got most of the opiates, cocaine and cannabis out of tonics and
non-prescription medicines. Doctors became responsible for most
drug distribution as the consumer beverage trade withdrew. As
drag dispensing was professionalised, substances used for
self-medication were replaced by more refined, more medically
controllable drags. The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission report made
no apparent difference to this at all, and it's quite possible
that nobody in the medical establishment read it. It held quite a
lot of scientific data but its purpose had been political rather
than medical. The political and economic interests of the British
Medical Association were quite different from those of the
Government of India.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The Cosmopolitan Dope Fiends<br>
</b></p>

<p>It is worth noting that most publications from the time refer
to &quot;Hashish,&quot; the Arabic term, Indian Hemp, or
Cannabis, rather than Charas, Ganja or Bhang, the Hindi names.
The French empire in North Africa had at least as much effect on
European cannabis use as the British empire in India. A certain
style of drug use, the Wasted Artist role, as established by the
laudanum swigging Coleridge and De Quincey early in the century,
was revived by Dr Jean Moreau in Paris after 1845. The doctor,
who experimented with hashish to treat insanity, founded the Club
des Hashishins with the writer Theophile Gautier, for non-medical
experiments. Some of the members were quite keen on a little
delirium. Gautier was a hack with brilliant friends, an 'art for
arts sake' romantic with a taste for macabre fantasy who
encouraged the Symbolist poets. Rimbaud and Verlaine shared his
drugs. Baudelaire dedicated &quot;Fleur du Mal&quot; to him, and
wrote an essay that explained their attitudes: &quot;On Hashish
and Wine as a means of expanding individuality.&quot; They
created strange, sensuous art, struck foreign poses based on
their beliefs about the romantic East, scandalised bourgeois
society [15].<br>
</p>

<p>By the 90's the club had imitators in London. If there was no
recreational drug use &quot;subculture&quot; in the 1890's, <b>one
</b>network came close. This was the circle of poets, psychics,
writers and would-be magicians around the Rhymers Club and the
Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. They didn't define their
connection by shared drug use, but they certainly included drug
experiments in their self-definition. Occult studies, drugs,
hypnotism, proto-psychiatry and new styles of arts were all
1890's fashions mingled in overlapping cliques in central London.
The Golden Dawn was established in 1888 by some occultist
Freemasons, as a society of &quot;Christian practiced magic. In
1890 Yeats and two others formed the Rhymers Club as a sort of
literary wing, drawing inspiration from the French Symbolists.
None of the Rhymers Club apart from Yeats ever achieved as much
recognition as their French heroes, but they had the style. They
were melancholy, self-dramatising, they hoped Byronic. They had
doomed love lives and nervous breakdowns, and mostly died young.
Their defiance of conventional society included such un-English
deviance as drinking black coffee and speaking comprehensible
French, as well as attempted magic, sexual permutations not
discussed in polite company, and hefty drug use.<br>
</p>

<p>Yeats and his lover Maude Gonne tried using hashish to improve
their telepathic powers. Others had a more relaxed, recreational
approach. Arthur Symons was one Rhymer who survived to he
described as &quot;highly strong, over-sensitive&quot; in the
1930's, best known for &quot;Confessions - A study in
Pathology&quot; which described his two years in an Italian
lunatic asylum and cure by near-fatal pneumonia in 1909. He was
the author of 'The Opium Smoker; &quot;I am engulfed, and drown
deliciously/soft music like a perfume, and sweet light/Golden
with audible odours exquisite/ swathe me in cerements for
eternity.../&quot;. In a biography of fellow Rhymer Ernest Dowson
he described one afternoon; a couple of ballet dancers and a poet
visiting, the host issuing tea, cakes, cigarettes and then
hashish. &quot;That slow intoxication, that elaborate experiment
in visionary sensations... he sat awaiting the magic, half shy in
the midst of that bright company of young people.&quot; Dowson
wrote poems with Latin titles <b>about </b>doomed love affairs,
and consorted with the &quot;most degraded&quot; women in
dockside dives. He experimented with mescal in 1896, with the
sexuality researcher Havelock Ellis. He died of TB in 1900, aged
32. The other poet present at the hash and tea party and the
mescal experiment was John Addington Symonds, a historian who
studied the criminal mentality - he was part blinded after
several breakdowns and TB. One of their associates, Count Eric
Stenbock, who wrote The Shadow of Death and Studies of Death, was
known for wearing a live snake around his neck; he died aged 35,
of either alcohol or opium.(13)<br>
</p>

<p>The Wasted Artists were picturesque and dramatic, and their
style became a popular image of drug abusers. Ethereal and rather
unhealthy, possibly creative but definitely pasty-faced. The
perception of a difference between drugs suitable for legitimate
use, under medical control, and drugs which can only be abused,
was extended by their example; anything they took was obviously
not doing any good for their health. Still there was no anti-drug
panic in the UK. Drugs were still seen as foreign stuff, only
used by those who wanted to act like foreigners. The artists were
added to an existing mythology of the opium addict and the opium
den, spread by popular fiction from Wilkie Collins to Oscar
Wilde, the addict over-sensitive, hollow-cheeked with torment,
the dens glided in rococo brothel style, populated by vicious
Chinese and degenerate aristocrats.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The Respectable Fear begins<br>
</b></p>

<p>The first demon dope stories came over from the USA in the mid
1890's. There were, apparently, ever-increasing numbers of Black
men with cocaine, Chinese with opium, and Mexicans with both,
plus marijuana. These coloured men were allegedly using their
fiendish substances to gain the flesh of white women, and many of
them would go crazy with big knives if frustrated in any way. The
British media only retold a few of these tales <b>at </b>first.
The pathological imagination of the US Press kept it up for the
next forty years, changing the drug and the villains' colour now
and again. Heroin was refined in 1898 but for the first few years
it was considered a miracle painkiller and cure for morphine
addiction. The subject of the grossest stories was cocaine, also
considered a miracle cure a few years earlier. The medical
enthusiasts didn't think it suitable for recreational use. The
recreational users disagreed. The alcohol prohibitionists built a
mass following and inflicted a huge social disaster on the USA.
When the alcohol ban was repealed, drug control was not. The
myths were retired for a few years, but similar stories can be
found, only slightly less racist, in the mass media today.<br>
</p>

<p>Before, during and after Prohibition, the USA lobbied for
international drugs laws, mixing economic self-interest with
moralism. The Hague Conference in 1912 agreed to the principle of
certain drugs being strictly for &quot;legitimate medical
purposes.&quot; It was never effective internationally because of
obstruction by the British opiate and German cocaine businesses.
The conference suggested an investigation of hemp, but it wasn't
followed up. The Assam Opium &amp; Ganja Committee of 1913(16)
showed that the IHDC had been forgotten or ignored in that
province of India, for instance accepting that ganja causes
insanity without calling any evidence. It did say that when ganja
prices rose users turned to opium, when opium prices rose they
turned to alcohol or, alarmingly, morphine. The number of
licensed shops in Assam had fallen from 1116 in 1878 to 347 in
1911, and the committee thought it couldn't be reduced further
without provoking unrest.<br>
</p>

<p>Recreational drug use in British literary circles in the '90s
spread through the next two decades into a wider worlds. Cocaine
use had spread well into the upper class by the First World War.
Officialdom grew concerned about officers on leave, who often
weren't afraid to wreck their health since their chances of
survival were slim. Morale would not be improved, it was felt, by
the sight of the upper ranks behaving like beasts, and it would
be worse yet if the common soldiers imitated them. There was a
press scare about the Germans using drugs and prostitutes,
collecting blackmail material. This unlikely tale and other
stories of moral degeneracy caught the imagination of the Army
Council, who banned the sale of all intoxicants to troops in mid
1916. In July the first U K law against possession of drags was
sneaked through, section 40B of the Defense of the Realm Act. It
covered cocaine and opiates; cannabis was not included, although
it had been considered. Section 40B also banned
&quot;Malththusian appliances&quot; (contraception) and quack
medicines. The same Act established legal closing times for pubs,
which caused a lot more fuss.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The post war scandal boom<br>
</b></p>

<p>Immediately after the Great War the British press got their
first US-style dope story. Actress Billie Carelton, age 21, died
supposedly from cocaine taken at an alcohol-free Victory Ball.
Her supplier was tried for manslaughter but could not be
convicted. It was just as likely the sleeping drug Veronal that
killed her, but that didn't bother the Daily Express. They
included hashish eating in the habits of a circle of degenerates
who, they said, had mined a sweet and innocent girl. In September
1920 a Dangerous Drugs Act was passed, clarifying the wartime
possession law and effectively dividing the drug trade into
medical vs criminal. It was greeted with such apathy by
Parliament <u>that </u>it was hard to make up a quorum in some of
the committees. Cannabis was still not banned.<br>
</p>

<p>Internationally, the UK government stopped blocking drug
controls after several scandals at home and reports that morphine
and cocaine addiction were spreading in the colonies. There were
more sex drugs and foreigner stories to keep up the postwar drug
scare. In 1922 the death of dancer Freda Kempton gained unwanted
publicity for Brilliant Chang, Chinese restaurant owner and
alleged dope king since 1917, handling morphine, opium and
hashish as well as cocaine. After many raids and mentions in the
press he was sentenced to 14 months - not much for such an
alleged villain - then departed in 1924. Eddie Manning, Jamaican
jazz drummer and alleged dope king, was convicted of dealing
opium and cocaine in '23. Both, it was strongly implied, had used
their dealing to get close to English girls. In 1922 three
sisters were found half dressed and unconscious in the company of
a dead Chinese man, Yee Sing a.k.a. Johnny Hop, in a sealed room
full of opium smoke above a Cardiff laundry. The girls never told
quite what had happened, so the press made it up, including a
Chinese love potion made from hashish used especially to subdue
white women, with an antidote made from geraniums.(17) Pulp
fiction by the likes of Sax Rohmer helped spread the corrupt
aristocrat and Chinese dope plot themes.<br>
</p>

<p>Despite all this advertisement, there was still no working
class drug subculture. The upmarket drug users of the 20's
continued to be found where the overlap between high society and
the arts copied what were seen as American fashions for jazz and
cocaine. Aleister Crowleys' 1922 novel, Diary of a Drug Fiend,
thinly disguised a real West End scene where cocaine was dealt in
the Cafe Royal on Regent Sweet. Crowley was a former Golden Dawn
member who publicised himself as &quot;The Wickedest Man in the
World,&quot; and ran a black magic cult largely based on sex. He
occasionally kicked his morphine habit cold turkey in front of
acolytes, to show the power of his will; he did quite a lot to
establish a link in the public mind between heavy drug use and
being a dangerous but pretentious creep. Chloroform and morphine
were popular with Lady Diana Cooper and Katherine Asquith, models
for several wild aristos in fiction. Morphine might be risky and
maybe immoral, but boozing was common, which was much worse.
Compared to these types cannabis users were sweethearts. Having
previously tried smoking it to no effect, the painter Augustus
John tried a hashish compote or jam after sardines and wine with
friends in Hampstead; &quot;...catching the eye of Iris, we were
both simultaneously seized with uncontrollable laughter, about
nothing at all...&quot; Despite the publicity, and penalties
increasing in 1922, prosecutions under the Dangerous Drugs Act
averaged a steady 60 a year for cocaine, 65 for opium. <br>
</p>

<p>Cannabis lust became illegal in the UK after the country
agreed the 1925 Geneva International Convention on Narcotics
Control. It was included in the '25 Convention with the opiates
and cocaine, because Egypt and Turkey proposed it. An Egyptian
delegate stirringly denounced &quot;Chronic Hashism&quot; which
he said caused most of the insanity in his country. It also, he
said, weakened users, gave them heart and digestive troubles and
made them look wild-eyed and stupid. India opposed including
cannabis in the Convention, as their delegate said it had been
used there since time immemorial, grew wild, and they doubted
that a prohibition could enforced. The British delegate abstained
from the vote but signed in the end. There was hardly any
parliamentary debate before it came into law as amendments to the
Dangerous Drugs Act on 281h September 1928. Despite this cannabis
offences, and 206 for opium. In 1950 for the first time there
were more prosecutions for cannabis than for opium and
manufactured drugs together - 86 against 41 opium and 42 others.
That year a series of police raids on jazz clubs produced a new
crop of stories about black men with drugs and white women, this
time involving marijuana and benzedrine. Cannabis had finally got
into the shock horror league.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Epilogue<br>
</b></p>

<p>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission finally had its moment in
Parliament in July 1967, after the Government had established an
Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence. J.J.S. Driberg, Chief of
Police and Inspector of Prisons for Assam, had given gave
evidence to the IHDC. His son Tom was a Labour MP. According to
his autobiography [18], the poet Alan Ginsberg asked Tom to
&quot;look up for him the report... in the House library I found
that my father had given evidence before this commission, putting
forward strongly the view that people living in a damp, cold
climate<u> </u>needed the traditional consolation of ganja... The
climate referred to was that of Assam, rather than England; but I
felt it was almost an act of filial piety to sign a full page
advertisement in the Times calling for a liberalisation of the
laws on pot...&quot; When it became obvious that there would be
no liberalisation, be attacked the government, his own party, in
the parliamentary debate. He said his father had told the IHDC
that when insane people were arrested a form had to be filled
saying why they were insane, and the safest thing to say was
ganja as the police knew that no further enquiry would be made.
When the government spokeswoman asked rhetorically &quot;What
sort of society will we create if everyone wants to escape from
reality 7&quot; Driberg answered that &quot;They want to escape
from this horrible society we have created.&quot; The 1968 Wooton
Committee on Cannabis was &quot;in agreement with the conclusions
reached by the IHDC... that the long-term consumption of cannabis
in moderate doses has no harmful effects.&quot; Given wide
publicity, the government couldn't completely to ignore this new
study; instead they did exactly the opposite of what it
recommended, and increased penalties for all cannabis offences in
a new 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. Cannabis use continued to
increase dramatically. By 1990 there were 40,194 convictions and
cautions for cannabis in the UK, well over 90% of all recorded
drugs crimes.<br>

<p><font size="5">CHAPTER IX</font> </p>

<p><font size="5">SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS.</font> </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Scope of this Chapter.</b> </p>

<p>431. In the instructions issued to the Commission by the
Government of India, reference is made to the use of hemp drugs
among fakirs and ascetics who are held in veneration by large
classes of the people, and to the custom, which is believed to
obtain to a large extent in Bengal, of offering an infusion of
bhang to every guest and member of the family on the last day of
the Durga Puja. The Commission were instructed to ascertain to
what extent these and similar customs prevail in Bengal and other
parts of India, and how far the use of hemp drugs forms a part of
social, or possibly religious, ceremonial or observance.
Questions 32 and 33 of the Commission's questions were intended
to elicit information on these points.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Bengal.</b> </p>

<p>432. In Bengal there is a considerable body of evidence
dealing with these customs, and more particularly with the custom
of offering an infusion of bhang on the last day of the Durga<b> </b>Puja.
Some few witnesses, it is true, state either that no social or
religious custom with which hemp drugs are connected exists, or
that they are unaware of any such custom; but the great majority
of the witnesses either give an account of them more or less
full, or allude to them briefly as matters of common notoriety.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Durga Puja.</b> </p>

<p>433. The custom of offering an infusion of the leaves of the
hemp plant to every guest and member of the family on the Bijoya
Dasami, or last day of the Durga Puja, is common in Bengal, and
may almost be said to be universal. It is alluded to by many of
the witnesses who refer to its use on this occasion as well as on
other days of the Durga Puja festival. But, while there can be no
doubt as to the existence of the custom, there is considerable
divergence of opinion as to the true nature of it. The custom
itself is a simple one. On the last day of this great festival
the male members of the family go forth to consign the image to
the waters and on their return the whole family with their guests
exchange greetings and embrace one another. During this rejoicing
a cup containing an infusion of the leaves of the hemp plant is
handed round, and all are expected to partake thereof, or at
least to place it to the lips in token of acceptance. Sweetmeats
containing hemp are also distributed. Opinion is almost equally
divided as to whether the custom is a mere social observance, or
whether it is an essential part of the religious ceremonial of
the festival. There is difference whether there is any injunction
in theof opinion among the witnesses as to <i>Shastras </i>rendering
obligatory the consumption of hemp; but Tantric religious works
sanction the use, and the custom whatever be its origin may now
be said from immemorial usage to be regarded by many people as
part of their religious observances. From the evidence of the
witnesses it would appear that there is no specific direction in
the <i>Shastras </i>of the manner in which the drug should be
used but from the references quoted it would appear that the use
alluded to is authority that of bhang in <i>the </i>form of an
infusion. Witnesses who can speak Mahamahon hopadhya Mahesa
Chandra Nyayaratna, C.I<font face="Courier New"> <font size="2"><tt>on
the subject, such as </font></tt></font><font size="4">Principal
of the Government Sanskrit College, Calcutta, testify to
religious sanction for the use of bhang or siddhi, while many
witnesses of high social position, well acquainted with the
habits of the people, as, for example, Maharaja Sir Jotindra
Mohain Tagore, K.C.S.I., Maharaja Durga Charan Law, Raja Piari
Mohan Mukharji, C.S.I., Rai Rajkumar Sarvadhikari Bahadur, Rai
Bahadur Kanai Lall . Day, C.I.E., and others, speak to the
prevalence of the custom, its intimate association with the
religious devotions of the people, and the innocent harmlessness
of the practice.<br>
</font></p>

<p><b>Other occasions on which bhang is used.</b> </p>

<p>434. The custom described above, and which refers solely to
bhang as distinguished from other preparations of the hemp plant,
is he most important occasion on which bhang is used as a part of
social or religious ceremonies; but there is evidence to show
that the drug in this form is used at other festivals. For
example, at the Holi festival, which is observed more generally
in Behar than in other parts of the Lower Provinces, bhang is
commonly consumed; and, according to many witnesses, at such
festivals as the Diwali, Chait Sankranti, Pous Sankranti,
Sripanchami, Sivachaturdasi, Ramnavami, and indeed on occasions
of weddings and many other family festivities. But, so far as the
evidence shows, the use on those occasions is a matter of social
custom observed more generally in some parts of the province than
in others, and, although nodoubt there may be some who consider
it essential to their devotions, partaking but little of the
nature of general religious observance. In Orissa bhang is
largely used by the attendants and worshippers at the temple of
Jagannath at Puri; and there appears also to exist a custom,
somewhat similar to that of the Durga Puja in Bengal, of offering
siddhi or bhang in the form of sweetmeats to the god Ganesh,
which are then eaten by the worshippers and their friends and
relatives. This festival, called the Ganesh Chaturthi, occurs in
the month of Bhadro (August-September).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Connection of ganja with the worship of Siva.</b> </p>

<p>435. It is chiefly in connection with the worship of Siva, the
Mahadeo or great god of the Hindu trinity, that the hemp plant,
and more especially perhaps ganja, is associated. The hemp plant
is popularly believed to have been a great favourite of Siva, and
there is a great deal of evidence before the Commission to show
that the drug in some form or other is now extensively used in
the exercise of the religious practices connected with this form
of worship. Reference to the almost universal use of hemp drugs
by fakirs, jogis, sanyasis, and ascetics of all classes, and more
particularly of those devoted to the worship of Siva, will be
found in the paragraphs of this report dealing with the classes
of the people who consume the drugs. These religious ascetics,
who are regarded with great veneration by the people at large,
believe that the hemp plant is a special attribute of the god
Siva, and this belief is largely shared by the people. Hence the
of many fond epithets ascribing to ganja the significance of a
divine pro-party, and the common practice of invoking the deity
in terms of adoration before placing the <i>chillum </i>or pipe
of ganja to the lips. There is evidence to show that on almost
all occasions of the worship of this god, the hemp drugs in some
form or other are used by certain classes of the people it is
established by the evidence of Mahamabopadhya Mahesa Chandra
Nyayaratna and of other witnesses that siddhi is offered to the
image of Siva at Benares, Baldynath, Tarakeswar, and elsewhere.
At the Shivratri festival, and on almost all occasions before the
on which this worship is practised, there is abundant evidence
Commission which shows not only that ganja is offered to the god
and consumed by these classes of the worshippers, but that these
customs are so intimately connected with their worship that they
may be considered to form in some sense an integral part of it.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Trinath.</b> </p>

<p>436. The special form of worship by the followers of Siva,
called the Trinath or Tinnath Mela, in which the use of ganja is
considered to be essential, is mentioned by many witnesses, and
deserves more than a passing notice. A full account of this
religious practice given by Babu Abhilas Chandra Mukharji will be
found in Vol. III Appendices of this Report. The origin of the
rite, which it is said sprang up first in Eastern Bengal, appears
to be of recent date, about the year 1867. It appears to be
observed at all times and at all seasons by Hindus and
Muhammadans alike, the latter calling it Tinlakh Pir. When an
object of special desire is fulfilled, or when a person recovers
from illness, or a son is born, or a marriage or other ceremony
is performed, the god Trinath, representing in one the Hindu
trinity, is worshipped. Originally one pice worth of ganja, one
pice worth of oil, and one pice worth of betel-nut was offered to
the god. But now ganja--it may be in large quantities--is
proffered, and during the incantations and the performance of the
ritual it is incumbent on all present to smoke. This form of
worship is shown to have spread extensively throughout Eastern
Bengal and the Surma Valley of Assam, and, according to one
witness, it has penetrated. even to Orissa. On the other hand,
there are a few witnesses who say that the practice is gradually
dying out. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Muhamadans</b> </p>

<p>437. The use of hemp drugs is as a rule in no way connected
with orthodox Muhammadan observances, whether social or
religious. The Muhammadan religion condemns such practices.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Assam..</b> </p>

<p>438. In Assam, where the use of hemp drugs is but little
practised by the Assamese proper, there appear to be no
indigenous customs connected with the drugs. But the customs
prevailing in Bengal are also found in Assam. There is evidence
as to the use of bhang or siddhi at the Durga Puja, and of ganja
by the worshippers of Siva. In Sylhet the Trinath form of worship
appears to prevail to a considerable extent. With reference to
this practice, one witness (Prasanno Kumar Das) observes that
&quot;in<i> </i>the Surma Valley ganja is offered in the name of
Pit Muhammadan saint) for the benefit of the cattle.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><b>North-Western Provinces.</b> </p>

<p>439. In the North-Western Provinces, where the celebration of
the Durga Puja is not so generally observed as in Bengal, a
con-siderable number of witnesses (some fifty in all) state that
there are no customs, religious or social, with which these drugs
are connected. But, on the other hand, there is overwhelming
evidence to establish the almost universal use by the people of
bhang at the Holi festival, and some evidence as to the common
use of ganja by certain classes of the followers of Siva at their
festivals and seasons of worship. Of the witnesses who speak to
the use of ganja in connection with religious observances, 22
state that it is essential and 92 that it is not essential. As to
whether the use of bhang should be regarded as a purely social
custom or as essential to religious observance,. the opinion of
witnesses who speak on the point is about equally divided. It is
sufficient to say that the custom is now a general one, and that
where the Holi festival is observed, there the practice of
consuming bhang during its observance is common. On other
occasions, such as the Diwali festival, marriages, and family
festivities, there is evidence to show that among certain classes
the consumption of bhang is common. Allusion is also frequently
made to the habit of using bhang, to which, for example, the
Chaubes of Mathra and Brindaban are notoriously addicted, but how
far the habit is connected with the religious observances at the
temples the evidence does not justify the formation of an
opinion. A custom is mentioned by, a Kumaon witness, Dharma Nand
Joshi, who states that a class of people called Ko<i>uls, </i>who
worship spirits, meat, fish, etc., have the bhang plant as one of
the objects of their worship.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Punnjab</b> </p>

<p>440. In the Punjab there is evidence as to the general use of
hemp by some of the followers of Siva, and especially of bhang,
at the Holi, Dasehra, Diwali, and other festivals, and on the
occasion o marriages and other family festivities. Among the
Sikhs the use of bhang as a beverage appears to be common, and to
be associated with their religious practices. The witnesses who
refer to this use by the Sikhs appear to regard it as an
essential part of their religious rites having the authority of
the Granth or Sikh scripture. Witness Sodhi Iswar Singh, Extra
Assistant Commissioner, says :&quot;As far as I know, bhang is
pounded by the Sikhs on the Dasehra day, and it is ordinarily
binding upon every Sikh to drink it as a sacred draught by mixing
water with it. <i>Legend--</i>Guru<i> </i>Gobind Singh, the tenth
guru, the founder of the Sikh religion, was on the gaddi of Baba
Nanak in the time of Emperor Aurangzeb. When the guru was at
Anandpur, tahsil Una, Hoshiarpur district, engaged in battle with
the Hill Rajas of the Simla, Kangra, and the Hoshiarpur
districts, the Rains sent an elephant, who was trained in
attacking and slaying the forces of the enemy with a sword in his
trunk and in breaking open the gates of forts, to attack and
capture the Lohgarh fort near Anandpur. The guru gave one of his
followers, Bachittar Singh, some bhang and a little of opium to
eat, and directed him to face the said elephant. This brave man
obeyed the word of command of his leader and attacked the
elephant, who was intoxicated and had achieved victories in
several battles before, with the result that the animal was
overpowered and the Hill Rajas defeated. The use of bhang,
therefore, on the Dasehra day is necessary as a sacred draught.
It is customary among the Sikhs generally to drink bhang, so that
Guru Gobind Singh has himself said the following poems in praise
of bhang: &quot;Give me, O Saki (butler), a cup of green colour
(bhang), as it is required by me at the time of battle (vide
'Suraj Parkash,' the Sikh religious book). &quot;Bhang is also
used on the Chandas day, which is a festival of the god Sheoji
Mahadeva. The Sikhs consider it binding to use it on the Dasehra
day-The quantity then taken is too small to prove
injurious.&quot; As Sikhs are absolutely prohibited by their
religion from smoking, the use of ganja and charas in this form
is not practised by them. of old Sikh times, is annually
permitted to collect without interference a boat load of bhang,
which is afterwards. distributed throughout the year to the
sadhus and beggars who are supported by the dharamsala. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Central Provinces.</b> </p>

<p>441. The evidence as to social or religious customs in the
Central Provinces is somewhat discrepant, but on the whole points
to the existence of customs akin to those existing in the
North-Western Provinces. The use of bhang at the Holi and Diwali
festivals and at marriages and such occasions, and of ganja or
bhang in connection with. the worship of Siva, is frequently
mentioned by the witnesses. A few local customs are also
mentioned by some witnesses. Regarding a custom of the Chamar
caste, the Rev. Mr. Jacob says: &quot;At Chanda; the Chamars use
ganja dust in the preparation of a beverage called <i>gulabpani, </i>which
is drunk at a ceremony called <i>dadhi </i>(the first shaving of
the beard), when no liquor is permitted.&quot; Among the Gonds,
Cowasjee Nusserwanjee Hattidaru describes the following custom as
existing:.&quot; In the funeral ceremony amongst the Gonds of
these provinces, <i>kalli </i>or flat ganja is placed over the
chest of the dead body of the Gond, and when the funeral party
returns home, a little of the ganja is burnt in the house of the
dead person, the smoke of which is supposed to reach the spirit
of the dead.&quot; Another Satpura witness, Hosen Khan, mentions
a custom of offering &quot;a<i> </i>little ganja at the Chitarai
Debis, or collections of stones with rags tied to some tree
above. They offer either a cock or a cocoanut or some ganja. It
is a custom among travellers. These Chitarai Debis are in the
open, and the travellers have a smoke at the same time.&quot; One
witness states that he has heard of the hemp plant being
worshipped in the Berars, but this is not corroborated by any of
the witnesses from these districts. Another has heard that the
Gonds in their hill homes are worshippers of the plant<br>
</p>

<p><b>Madras.</b> </p>

<p>442. In the Madras Presidency, where the use of hemp drugs is
less common than in most other provinces, many witnesses assert
that there are no customs, social or religious, with which they
are connected, and the evidence as a whole fails to establish the
prevalence of any customs so general as those connected with the
Durga Puja and the worship of Siva in Bengal or the Holi festival
in the North-Western Provinces. But there is evidence as to the
existence of customs of a less general or widespread nature. In
Ganjam, the witnesses speak to the common use bhang on the <i>Mesha
Sankranti </i>day in honour of Siva and Anjanayya, and also in
the worship of Durga. Several also allude to a custom of offering
a confection or draught containing bhang to the image at the
temples of Hanuman. At the festival of Kama, the Indian cupid,
bhang is freely made and drunk according to several witnesses.
The Rajputs or Bondilis are particularly referred to in
connection with this custom. On occasions of holidays or
gala-days, and at the Mohurram, a number of witnesses say it is
usual for Muhammadans as well as Hindus to take bhang. It is also
said that various intoxicants, including ganja, are sometimes
offered to the gods in worship, and then swallowed by those
offering them. Witness M. Sundaram Iyer, Deputy Tahsildar (60),
says: &quot;Some<i> </i>of the lower orders make use of ganja as
an offering, like cocoa-nut, plantains, liquor, and such other
articles, for certain deities, such as Mathura--veeran,
Muniappan, etc., according to the vow taken by each person. This
cannot be considered as essential, but is only a practice
observed in very rare cases. Such practice is not followed by
many people, and it is not injurious. &quot;Others allude to the
offering of ganja to Karuppannam, Kali, Mathuraveeran, Muniappan,
Karuannaswami, and Aiyaswami, more particularly in the south of
the Presidency. Mr. Azizuddin, Sahib Bahadur, Deputy Collector,
says: &quot;Neither<i> </i>the Musalman nor the Hindu religion
requires the use of these drugs on religious occasions. On the
other hand, it is prohibited. Nevertheless, in the <i>maths </i>of
bairagis, such as at Tripati, and of Muhammadan saints, such as
at Nagore Conjeveram, Arcot, and other places, the manager of the
shrine distributes ganja to all the fakirs who assemble during
the festival. In none of these places, religiously speaking,
ganja should be distributed, but, according to custom among the
fakirs, its distribution is essential.&quot; The Rev. Mr.
Campbell says that ganja is used in connection with the funeral
ceremonies observed by certain classes, but that the use is not
essential. Mr. Merriman alludes to a custom of offering and
consuming bhang at the funeral of bhang consumers.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Bombay</b> </p>

<p>443. An interesting note, entitled &quot;The Religion of
Hemp,&quot; by Mr. J. M. Campbell, C.I.E., will be found in Vol.
III Appendices. In the Bombay presidency the use of hemp in
connection with the worship of Siva, Mahadev or Shankar appears
to be very common. It is referred to by many witnesses. The
following description of this custom as prevailing in part of
Gujarat, Kaira, and probably Ahmedabad has been furnished to the
Excise Commissioner by Mr. B. E. Modi, Deputy Collector: &quot;On<i>
</i>the Shivratri day (the last day but one of the month of
Magh), sacred to the god Mahadev or Shankar, bhang water is
freely poured over the <i>lingam. </i>Mahadev is an ascetic, and
is fond of bhang, and on this day it is considered a religious
duty to offer him his favourite drink. From this day to the 11th
day of Ashad, on which day gods go to sleep, water is kept
constantly dripping upon the <i>lingam </i>of Mahadev from an
earthen pot kept above it. &quot;Somewhat similar accounts
varying in detail are given by many witnesses coming from
different parts of the province, of whom some also refer to the
habit which ganja smokers have of invoking the deity before
placing the pipe. to their lips. Others also refer to hemp as
required in the worship of Baldeo and to its use at the Shimga or
Holi festival. The Marwaris and some other classes appear to use
bhang at marriages and other festivities. Mr. Charles, Collector
of Belgaum, says that among Musalmans and Marathas the ganja
plant is offered to dead relatives who used it in their lifetime
at the time of the anniversary ceremonies of their death. There
appears to be no special custom of worshipping the hemp plant
itself. R. K. Kothavale, of Satara district, says the hemp plant
is worshipped, by one sect only, namely, by people from Northern
India and Nepal, while Mr. Lamb, Collector of Alibag, remarks
that some of the Kunbis who make Offerings to the local
divinities of their fields at the harvest season include a. small
quantity of ganja in the offerings.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Sind.</b> </p>

<p>444. In Sind the customs, both religious and' social, appear
to be much the same as in Bombay. In Karachi and some other
places bhang is generally offered to all comers on occasions of
marriages, panchayats, and other gatherings; and the custom of
freely distributing bhang as a charity to all who dare to partake
is common both at temples and at other places of resort.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Berar.</b> </p>

<p>445. In Berar there is evidence as to the use both of ganja
and bhang at the Shivratri and Holi festivals and at social
gatherings. The hemp plant itself is not worshipped, but,
according to one witness, when a consumer dies, the plant is kept
near his corpse during the funeral ceremony. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Ajmere-Merwara.</b> </p>

<p>446. At the Holi and the Shivratri and at family festivities
the drugs, especially bhang, are used. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Baluchistan.</b> </p>

<p>447. Major Gaisford, Deputy Commissioner, states that among
the Hindu sect called Barn Bargis the consumption of bhang is
regarded as essential.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Native States.</b> </p>

<p>448. From Native States there is but little information
regarding customs, either social or religious, with which these
drugs are connected. No purely local or indigenous customs have
been brought to the notice of the Commission, but there is
sufficient information to show that practices similar to those
existing in British provinces at the Holi and Shrivratri
festivals and on occasions of family rejoicings are observed by
certain classes of the people in many Native States.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Worship of the hemp plant</b> </p>

<p>449. The custom of worshipping the hemp plant, although not so
prevalent as that of offering hemp to Siva and other deities of
the Hindus, would nevertheless appear from the statements of the
witnesses to exist to some extent in some provinces of India. The
reason why this fact is not generally known may perhaps be
gathered from such statements as that of Pandit Dharma Nand
Joshi, who says that such worship is performed in secret. There
may be another cause of the denial on the part of the large
majority of Hindu witnesses of any knowledge of the existence of
a custom of worshipping the hemp plant in that the educated Hindu
will not admit that he worships the material object of his
adoration, but the deity as represented by it. The custom of
worshipping the hemp plant, though not confined to the Himalayan
districts or the northern portions of India alone, where the use
of the products of the hemp plant is more general among the
people, is less known as we go south. Still even far south, in
some of the hilly districts of the Madras Presidency and among
the rural population, the hemp plant is looked upon with some
sort of veneration. Mr. J. H. Merriman (witness No. 28, Madras)
says: <i>&quot;I </i>know of no custom of worshipping the hemp
plant, but believe it is held in a certain sort of veneration by
some classes.&quot; Mr. J. Sturrock, the Collector of Coimbatore
(witness No. 2, Madras), says: &quot;In some few localities there
is a tradition of sanctity attached to the plant, but no regular
worship. &quot;The Chairman of the Conjeveram Municipal Board,
Mr. E. Subramana Iyer (witness No. 143, Madras) says: &quot;There
is no plant to be worshipped here, but it is generally used as
sacrifices to some of the minor Hindu deities. &quot;There is a
passage quoted from <i>Rudrayanmal Danakand and Karmakaud </i>in
the report on the use of hemp drugs in the Baroda State, which
also shows that the worship of the bhang plant is enjoined in the
<i>Shastras. </i>It is thus stated: &quot;The god Shiva says to
Parvati-- 'Oh,<i> </i>goddess Parvati, hear the benefits derived
from bhang. The worship of bhang raises one to my position. In <i>Bhabishya
Puran </i>it is stated that &quot;on the 13th moon of Chaitra
(March and April) one who wishes to see the number of his sons
and grandsons increased must worship <i>Kama </i>(Cupid) in the
hemp plant, etc.&quot;.<br>
</p>

<p><b>General conclusions</b> </p>

<ol>
    <li>In summing up their conclusions on this chapter, the
        Commission would first remark that charas, which is a
        comparatively new article of consumption, has not been
        shown to be in any way connected with religious
        observance. As regards Northern India, the Commission are
        of opinion that the use of bhang is more or less common
        everywhere in connection with the social and religious
        customs of the people As regards ganja they find that
        there are certain classes in all parts, except the
        Punjab, who use the drug in connection with their social
        and religious observances. The Commission are also of
        opinion in regard to bhang that its use is considered
        essential in some religious observances by a large
        section of the community, and in regard to ganja that
        those who consider it essential are comparatively very
        few. The Commission have little doubt that interference
        with the use of hemp in connection with the customs and
        observances above referred to would be regarded by the
        consumers as an interference with long established usage
        and as an encroachment upon their religious liberty. And
        this feeling would, especially in the case of bhang,
        undoubtedly be shared to some extent by the people at
        large. Regarding Southern India, the same remarks apply
        with this reservation, that. the difference between ganja
        and bhang as materials for smoking and drinking
        respectively is much less marked there, and the
        distinction between the two forms of the drug is much
        less clearly recognised, although by the term<i> </i>&quot;bhang&quot;
        is generally meant the drug as used for drinking, and by
        &quot;ganja&quot;<i> </i>the drug as used for smoking. </li>

<p><font size="5">THE POLICY OF HEMP DRUG ADMINISTRATION<br>
</font></p>

<hr>

<p><b>General principles regarding sumptuary laws and their
application to India.</b> </p>

<p>553. The question of prohibiting the growth of the hemp plant
and the sale of ganja and allied drugs is one which stands in the
to forefront Of the present inquiry. It has been remarked by a
well known historian that &quot;no<i> </i>laws are of any service
which are above the working level of public morality, and the
deeper they are carried down into life, the larger become the
opportunities of evasion. If these words are true as applied to
England under a feudal system, they are much more true in the
present day as applied to British India. The Government of this
country has not grown out of the forces contained within it, but
has been superimposed upon them, and the paternal system of
government which may have been suitable in England during the
sixteenth century, and in, the initial development of some Indian
provinces during the period immediately following their
annexation, becomes purely visionary when public opinion is in
process of formation and the needs of the people are year by year
finding more ready expression. Occasionally, no doubt, the
Legislature in India has anticipated a standard of morality not
universally accepted by the people, as in the case of laws
relating to infanticide or the burning of Hindu widows; but these
measures were passed under an overwhelming sense of the necessity
of correcting popular notions of morality in matters coming well
within the sphere of Government, and in the assurance that in the
course of time they could not fail to secure the assent of all
intelligent members of the community. In the chapter of Mill's
Political Economy which treats of the non-interference principle,
a distinction is made between two kinds of intervention by the
Government-- the one authoritative interference, and the other
giving advice or promulgating information. And the following
remarks are made regarding the former: </p>

<p>&quot;It is evident, even at first sight, that the
authoritative form of Government intervention has a much more
limited sphere of legitimate action than the other. It requires a
much stronger necessity to justify it in any case, while there
are large departments of human life from which it must be
unreservedly and imperiously excluded. Whatever theory we adopt
respecting the foundation of the social union, and under whatever
political institutions we live, there is a circle around every
individual human being which no Government, be it that of one, or
of few, or of the many, ought to be permitted to overstep there
is a part of the life of every person who has come to years of
discretion within which the individuality of that person ought to
reign uncontrolled either by any other individual or by the
public collectively. That there is, or ought to be, some space in
human existence thus entrenched around no one who professes the
smallest regard to human freedom or dignity will call in
question: the point to be determined is where the limit should be
placed; how large a province of human life this reserved
territory should include. I apprehend that it ought to include
all that part which concerns only the life, whether inward or
outward of the individual, and does not affect. the interests of
Others, or affect. them only through the moral influence of
example. With respect to the domain of the inward consciousness,
the thoughts and feelings, and as much of external conduct as is
personal only, involving no consequences, none at least of a
painful or injurious kind, to other people, I hold that it is
allowable in all, and in the more thoughtful and cultivated often
a duty, to assert and promulgate with all the force they are
capable of their opinion of what is good or bad, admirable or
contemptible, but not to compel others to conform to that
opinion, whether the force used is that of extra legal coercion,
or exerts itself by means of the law. Even in those portions of
conduct which do affect the interests of others, the onus of
making out a case always lies on the defenders of legal
prohibitions.<i> </i>It is not merely a constructive or
presumptive injury to others which will justify the interference
of law with individual freedom. To be prevented from what one is
inclined to, or from acting contrary to one's own judgment of
what is desirable, is not only always irksome, but always tends, <i>pro
tanto, </i>to starve the development of some portion of the
bodily or mental faculties, either sensitive or active; and,
unless the conscience of the individual goes freely with the
legal restraint, it partakes, either in a great or in a small
degree, of the degradation of slavery. Scarcely any degree of
utility short of absolute necessity will justify a prohibitory
regulation, unless it can also be made to recommend itself to the
general conscience; unless persons of ordinary good intentions
either believe already, or can be induced to believe, that the
thing prohibited is a thing which they ought not to wish to
do.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>These remarks have been given at length, because the
Commission believe that they contain a clear exposition of the
principles which should guide them in deciding whether the
prohibition of the hemp drugs should be authoritatively enforced
by Government. <br>
</p>

<p><b>The question of entirely suppressing all intoxicants.</b> </p>

<p>554- Now, a certain number of .persons (among whom may in all
probability,- be reckoned the mover of the question in the, House
of Commons which led to the appointment of the-Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission) deem it to be the duty of the British Government to
suppress the trade in all intoxicants in all the countries under
its sway; and there are no doubt special circumstances<i> </i>in
India which render it less, impossible than in some other
countries to consider even so drastic a policy. These are notably
the general sobriety of its races and the feeling, popular as
well as religious, which prevails against their use among a large
section of the community. Even then no appeal in support of such
a measure can be made to the public morality <font
face="Courier New"><font size="4"><tt>or </tt></font>practice of
civilised nations at large, nor, so far as the Commission are
aware, to any marked success attending the experiment in
particular instances. In the exceptional cases in which the
experiment has been attended with partial success (as in some of
the American States), the reformation of the habit has become an
object of desire to the majority of the people, and the enactment
for promoting Such reformation has presented itself less as a
restrictive force than as an auxiliary agency <br>
</font></p>

<p><b>Not laid before the commission</b> </p>

<p>555. But the Commission are not called upon to pronounce on so
wide an issue. It was not upon the basis of this general
principle that the Secretary of State for India accepted the
proposal made in the House of Commons, nor do the instructions
issued to the Commission by the Government of India cover so wide
a field. The question of prohibiting the production and sale of
the hemp drugs in India has to be considered by the Commission
apart from the general question, and such prohibition must be
justified, if at all, on some more special ground than the mere
fact that they are intoxicants.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The past history of the case how far to be relied upon.</b>
</p>

<p>556. Again, there are a certain number of persons whose'
evidence before the Commission points to the assumption that the
case for prohibition of the hemp drugs has already been
established in the records of the Government, and that further
enquiry implies a willful blindness to what has been abundantly
proved by such records. A reference to Chapter XII of this Report
will show how untrustworthy these records are in regard to the
production of insanity by the use of the drugs-- an aspect of the
question which is of the utmost importance, and has formed the
basis of nearly all the official opinion heretofore recorded.
against such use. And, after availing themselves fully of every
opportunity of consulting the official literature on the subject,
the Commission have arrived at the conclusion that it shows
little originality, and that a very limited amount of personal
observation has been made to do duty as the basis of large
conclusions. The want of reliable data has been compensated by
annual reiteration until the stamp of antiquity has secured for
the opinions so expressed a large amount of acquiescence among
officials who had neither the time nor the opportunity to examine
the matter for themselves So far, therefore, as the effects of
the hemp drugs are concerned, the Commission have had to approach
the subject as almost a <i>tabula rasa, </i>and, while availing
themselves of the imperfect data previously collected, have
endeavoured to avoid accepting any conclusions without a
substantial foundation of well ascertained facts. The attitude,
however, of the Government in regard to the question may be
briefly described. So far back as 1798 an inquiry was made in
Bengal regarding the quality of ten intoxicating articles--
&quot;opium, madak ganja, subzi, bhang, majum, banker, charas,
tobacco, and toddy--&quot; with a view to determining whether it
might not be advisable to prohibit altogether the sale of any of
them. The conclusion arrived at, which was stated in a letter of
the Board to the Governor-General in Council, No. 22, dated 29th
May 1798, was to the following effect. &quot;It appears that the
original productions are as follows: Tobacco, opium, ganja, subzi
or bhang, banker, and toddy, and that the three remaining
articles are for the most part compositions of those here
recited, as above mentioned. With respect to the drugs specified
m the foregoing schedule, they are not for the most part
represented as producing any very violent or dangerous effects of
intoxication except when taken to excess; and, although the
operation of them-may be more powerful in their compound state,
we apprehend it would be difficult to sanction the sale of the
original productions, and to prohibit with effect the use of
compositions of which they are susceptible; to which may be added
that most of these articles, both as original productions and as
artificial combinations appear to be useful either in medicine or
otherwise; for these reasons we do not deem it necessary to
recommend that the sale of any of them be altogether prohibited,
but shall proceed to state what appear to us the. best means of
restraining the use of them, and improving the revenue by the
imposition of such taxes as are best adapted to the nature of the
case.&quot; A complete inquiry was made in 1871 from all
provinces as to the effects of several preparations of hemp; and
if the result should call for any action in the direction of
restricting them by enhancement of the duty or of limiting, or
even prohibiting, the cultivation of the. plant, the advice of
the Local Governments was invited as to the expediency and
practicability of such measures. The result is contained in the
Resolution of the Government of. India, Finance Department, No.
3773, dated 17th December 1873. The following passage shows the
conclusion arrived at: <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Upon a consideration of all the opinions thus collected,
it does not appear to the Governor-General in Council to be
specially proved that hemp incites to crime more than other drugs
or than spirits. And there is some evidence to show that on rare
occasions this drug, usually so noxious, may be usefully taken.
There can, however, be no doubt that its habitual use does
produce insanity. The total number of cases of insanity is small
in proportion to the population, and not large even in proportion
to the number of ganja smokers; but of the cases of insanity
produced by the excessive use of drugs or spirits, by far the
largest number must be attributed to the abuse of hemp. Lower
Bengal the circumstances have admitted of a system under which
the consumption of ganja has been reduced one-half, while the
amount of duty levied on it has been doubled. It would be very
desirable to control the cultivation and preparation of ganja and
bhang elsewhere-in the same way. But it is believed that this
would not be easy; indeed, it would probably be impracticable.
Moreover, with the exception of the Chief Commissioners of
British Burma and the Central Provinces, the Local Governments
are not in favour of altering existing arrangements. His
Excellency in Council, however, trusts that the various Local
Governments and Administrations will endeavour, wherever it may
be possible, to discourage the consumption of ganja and bhang by
placing restrictions on their cultivation, preparation and
retail, and imposing on their use as high a rate of duty as can
be levied without inducing illicit practices. As regards British
Burma, the Chief Commissioner has already been informed that the
Governor-General in Council concurs with him in thinking that the
cultivation and consumption of ganja should be absolutely
prohibited, and it has been prohibited from the beginning of the
year 1873-74. &quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In 1877 the Bengal Government appointed a special officer,
Babu Hem Chunder Kerr, to make a full inquiry into the details of
the cultivation of ganja, the sufficiency or otherwise of the
present safeguards, and the reforms which it might be advisable
to introduce. Sir Ashley Eden's conclusions on this officer's
report in regard to the effects of ganja and policy to be
followed were as follows: &quot;The Lieutenant-Governor has
himself no doubt that the use of ganja in any form is injurious
to the consumer, and that it is the duty of Government to make
the tax on this article as high as it can possibly bear.
Unfortunately it is habitually used by large numbers of the lower
classes of the population, who would, if deprived of it
altogether, apparently find in the leaves of the wild hemp plant
and in other drugs narcotics and stimulants of equally
deleterious character. It does not seem possible, therefore, to
stop the cultivation altogether. The policy of Government must be
to limit its production and sale by a high rate of duty without
placing the drug entirely beyond the reach of those who will
insist upon having it.&quot; The last important utterance on the
subject previous to the appointment of the Commission is
contained in the letter of the Government of India, Finance
Department, to Her Majesty's Secretary of State, No. 212, dated
9th August 1892, in which the following remarks occur: &quot;We
are inclined to believe that ganja is the most noxious of all
intoxicants now commonly used in India. But even if the absolute
prohibition of the use of the drug could be enforced, the result
might be to induce the use of still more noxious drugs. India
abounds with plants growing wild from which drugs can be procured
which are more deleterious in their effects than ganja. One such<i>
</i>plant is the dhatura <i>(Stramonium), </i>the seeds of which
are already used to intensify the narcotic effects of bhang, a
liquid preparation of hemp leaves; and we apprehend that if the
use of ganja were suppressed altogether, dhatura might be largely
resorted to by the poorer classes as a means of satisfying their
craving for stimulants. Apart, however, from the objections just
mentioned, we believe. that it would be impossible to enforce in
India a prohibition of the use of ganja. That drug is produced in
Native States, and the difficulties in the way of preventing its
import from them, if the supply in British India were cut off,
would be immense. It would not, moreover, be possible to suppress
the supply in British India. The hemp plant grows readily in
India, in many places wild without cultivation of any kind, and
it would be easy for any one addicted to the use of ganja to grow
a plant or two in the enclosure of his own house and in nooks and
corners which would be safe from observation and from the risk of
detection. The question in the House of Commons suggests that as
the possession and sale of ganja has been prohibited for many
years in Burma, it is desirable that the same prohibition should
be extended to other provinces of British India. The analogy of
Burma does not, however, apply to India. When the prohibition was
enforced in Burma, the drug was very little used by the Native
Burmese, its consumption being almost entirely confined to
coolies and other immigrants from India; and the cultivation of
the plant in Burma, which had never been extensive, had virtually
ceased, the consumers being dependent on importations for their
supplies. In India, on the other hand, the practice of ganja
smoking has existed from time immemorial, and among certain sects
of Hindus, ascetics, and religious mendicants hemp intoxication
is habitually indulged in; and, as explained in the preceding
paragraph, it would be impossible to suppress the growth of the
plant. But, although we consider it impracticable to enforce the
absolute prohibition of the use of ganja, we fully recognise it
as our duty to restrict its consumption as far as practicable,
and we have distinctly laid down the policy to be pursued in
respect of this drug in our Resolution of the 17th December 1873
already quoted. The annual reports of Excise Administration show
that the subject has since been continually before Local
Governments, who are making every possible endeavour to minimise
the evils and discourage the use of the drug wherever it is a
source of danger to consumers.&quot; Thus &quot;restraining the
use and improving, the revenue by the imposition of suitable
taxation,&quot; &quot;discouraging<i> </i>the consumption by
placing restrictions on the cultivation, preparation, and retail,
and imposing on their use as high a rate of duty as can be levied
without inducing illicit practices,&quot; &quot;limiting the
production and sale by a high rate of duty without placing the
drug entirely beyond the reach of those who will insist upon
having it,&quot;<i> </i>&quot;restricting consumption as far as
practicable, minimising the evils, and discouraging the use of
the drug wherever it is a source of danger to consumers&quot;
have from time to time been the watch-words of the Government in
the matter of the hemp drugs, a policy only once definitely
abandoned, <i>viz., </i>in the case of Burma, where total
prohibition was introduced in 1873. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Prohibition in other countries.</b> </p>

<p>557. Allusion must be made to precedents for the prohibition
of the hemp drugs in other countries in order to complete these
general observations. Excepting British Burma (reference to which
will be made further on), the Commission only know of four cases
of prohibition, <i>viz., </i>in Turkey, Egypt, Greece, and
Trinidad. For the first three of these, the only information at
the disposal of the Commission is contained in the communications
from Her Majesty's representatives addressed to the Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs in 1892 in consequence of a requisition
made on them by the Earl of Rosebery at the request of Mr. W S
Caine, M.P.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Turkey</b> </p>

<p>558. The ground of the prohibition in Turkey is thus stated in
a note addressed by the Grand Vizir to the Ministry Commerce,
Constantinople, on 1st March 1292 <i>(sic)</i>:&quot;From<i> </i>the
reports furnished by the Imperial Medical Council, it appeared
that the use of hashish in the preparation of medicines was
extremely rare, and that, being a narcotic, its use must of
necessity be injurious, and that consequently the suppression of
the cultivation of hashish could not fail to prove highly
advantageous.&quot; The effect of the prohibition is thus
described in an enclosure to the Ambassador's reply: &quot;The
importation and sale in Turkey of hashish, though contraband, is
still, I hear, largely carried on, and is used for smoking, in
the composition of various sweetmeats, and as an opiate in
general.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><b>Egypt.</b> </p>

<p>559. In Egypt the cultivation, use, and importation of hashish
were first forbidden in 1868, but in 1874 it was allowed to be
imported on payment of duty. In November 1877 an order was
received from Constantinople that all hashish brought into Egypt
was to be seized and destroyed, and finally, in March 1879, the
importation and cultivation of hashish were prohibited by a
Khedivial decree. In March 1884 it was provided that confiscated
hashish should be sold by the Customs (for delivery abroad)
instead of being destroyed as formerly, and the proceeds of the
sale divided amongst the informers and officers who took part in
the seizure. &quot;This measure was rendered necessary,&quot;
says Mr. Caillard, the Director-General of the Customs, &quot;by<i>
</i>the absence of any fund from which rewards could be
distributed; while, on the other hand, the profits of smuggling
being very great, large sums were paid by the smugglers to insure
the silence or complicity of the Customs officers,
coastguards-men, and others. A considerable number of persons are
employed in the smuggling trade, many of them having subsistence.
Great ingenuity is displayed by the smugglers no other means of
and no sooner has one trick been discovered than another isin
this illicit trade, of the contrainvented. The great obstacle,
however, to the complete repression band trade is the refusal of
some of the European Governments to recognize the right of the
Egyptian Government to search suspected shops or warehouses, and
to punish the delinquents by fine as well as confiscation. In
view of the impossibility of suppressing the contraband trade in
hashish under the suggested to the Minister of Finance
circumstances described above, desirability of removing the
prohibition against the importation of the and I proposed to
collect a customs duty of P. T. 100 per kilogramme (<i>9s. 3d.</i>per
lb.), besides it license-tax on the sale of hashish. It has been
abundantly proved that the vice of hashish smoking cannot be
suppressed by legislation, whereas by a system of licenses it may
be kept under control to some extent. &quot;Mr. Caillard
estimates that the quantity of hashish consumed annually in Egypt
cannot be less than 50,000 okes (about lbs. 140,000)
notwithstanding the prohibition. He states that the hashish
appears to be manufactured chiefly in Greece. </p>

<p><b>Greece.</b> </p>

<p>560. In Greece there is no law regulating or specially
alluding to the product as merchandise is allowed, but a Police
order of 1891 prohibits its sale and consumption in the small
cafes of Athens and the Piroeus, in some of which, during the
previous ten or fifteen years apparently, the habit of using this
drug had been gradually introduced. The order was based upon a
report of the Sanitary Board at Athens, in which prominent
mention is made of the observations made in India by English
doctors, and the statistics of insanity in Bengal lunatic asylums
ascribed to the use of the hemp drugs are put forward as
justifying, repressive measures. The effect of the order passed
is not mentioned, sufficient time not having elapsed.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Trinidad..</b> </p>

<p>561<i>. </i>As regards Trinidad, the Commission are not sure
that the hemp drugs are prohibited. The fact has been stated by
the Indian Immigrants Commission, Natal, 1885-87, and by Dr.
Thomas Ireland, Government Medical Officer, British Guiana, in a
paper published in the <i>Alienist and Neurologist, </i>St.
Louis, in October 1893. But,<i> </i>on the other hand,
Surgeon-Major Comins, lately on special duty in British and
Foreign Colonies and the Netherlands, in his Note on Emigration
from India to Trinidad, 1893, quotes a statement of the Protector
of Immigrants, who says that in the year 1885 an Ordinance was
passed requiring the payment of L100 per acre to obtain a license
to grow ganja, which had previously been grown in large
quantities. This practically put a stop to the growth and
consumption for several years, but immigrants who had left
Trinidad two years previous to the writing of his report had been
growing it in Venezuela, and several seizures had been made by
the Customs officers from persons endeavouring to introduce it
into Trinidad. The Protector adds: &quot;With<i> </i>a coast line
such as ours, adjacent to that of the Spanish Main, it will be
impossible to prevent its introduction into this colony if
immigrants who go there continue to grow it.&quot; Dr. Comins
himself says: &quot;I do not know what are the laws in force here
regarding the sale of opium and ganja.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><b>Basis of prohibition and results in these countries</b>. </p>

<p>562.<i> </i>Thus in the case of other countries, where the use
of the drugs has been prohibited, the Commission do not find in
the literature available to them many arguments for prohibition.
In Turkey it rests upon the theory accepted by orthodox
Muhammadans that hashish <i>&quot;being </i>a narcotic its use
must of necessity be injurious,&quot; while in Egypt the
prohibition emanated from Turkey. In both these countries the
measure has by no means been attended with complete success. In
Greece the prohibition in the cafes of Athens is based largely
upon Indian experience, which the Commission have had cause in
great measure to recast. In Trinidad, if there has been
prohibition, it does not seem of late to have been effectual. It
must be added that the Commission have no scientific information
regarding the strength of the article of commerce called hashish,
and it may differ to some extent from the Indian products. From
the description of its manufacture even by the Mayor of
Orchomenus in Mantines in Arcadia, whence the Egyptian supply is
mainly derived, it appears to resemble more the charas of Yarkand
than the ganja or bhang of India.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Is prohibition in India justifiable, feasible, and
advisable?</b> </p>

<p>563. Starting, therefore, from the position that what is known
of the hemp drugs in the past is not sufficient to justify their
prohibition in India, and that for such a measure there must be
strong justification based on ascertained facts scientifically
and systematically examined, the first question for the
Commission to decide is whether such justification is to be found
in the evidence before them, and the second-whether, if this is
so, prohibition is feasible and advisable on other grounds. These
will now be considered. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Prohibition of bhang</b> </p>

<p>564. The effects of the hemp drugs have been treated in
Chapters X to XIII of the Report; and as the first result of
these conclusions, the Commission are prepared to state that the
suppression of the use of bhang would be totally unjustifiable.
It is established to their satisfaction that this use is very
ancient, and that it has some religious tion among a large body
of Hindus; that it enters into their social customs; that it is
almost without exception harmless in moderation, and perhaps in
some cases beneficial; that the abuse of it is not so harmful as
the abuse of alcohol; that its suppression, involving the
extirpation of the wild hemp plant, would in some tracts be a
matter of great difficulty; that such a measure would be
extremely unpopular, and would give rise to widespread
discontent; and, finally, that, if successfully accomplished, it
would lead to the use of more hurtful stimulants. The Commission
deem it unnecessary to traverse the evidence further than has
been done in the preceding chapters of this report in support of
these propositions. It is almost unanimous in regard to them. The
utmost that is necessary in regard to this product is that it
should be brought under more effective control, and this matter
will be dealt with further on. But absolute prohibition is, in
the opinion of the Commission, entirely out of the question. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Prohibition of ganja and charas</b> </p>

<p>565. Though it has been shown that as a rule ganja and charas
are used in moderation, and that the moderate use ordinarily.
does not cause appreciable injury, yet it has been established
that the excessive use of these forms of hemp drugs has been more
injurious than in the case of bhang. Whether they should be
prohibited or merely controlled is a question which might be
settled merely with reference to their ascertained effects. The
Commission consider that the effects are not such as to call for
prohibition, and on the general principles discussed in the
opening paragraphs of this chapter, such interference would be
unjustifiable. Nevertheless, it. seems advisable to refer to the
other evidence with a view to ascertaining the generally
prevailing views on the subject, and considering the grounds on
which prohibition is advocated or opposed.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The evidence regarding prohibition of ganja and charas may
be considered together.</b> </p>

<p>566. In reviewing the evidence on these points, it will not be
necessary to draw a distinction between ganja and charas. The
effects of these two drugs have been shown to be similar, though
charas is <i>cateris paribus </i>the more potent. They are both
ordinarily smoked, though very occasionally used for eating and
drinking usually in the form of admixtures with other condiments
stated by Mr. Lyall (Bengal 1): &quot;Ganja<i> </i>and charas are
really one, and in time, if the question be scientifically
followed up, possibly charas will be the only form used.&quot;
The refuse of ganja is used in some provinces as bhang, but this
substance more nearly resembles bhang than ganja properly so
called. The ganja of the different provinces varies in quality.
But these distinctions cannot here be specially observed; it will
be sufficient to bear in mind that the opinions in Bengal, the
Central Provinces, Madras, Bombay, and the smaller
Administrations relate to ganja; that those in the Punjab relate
to charas; and that those in the North-Western Provinces and Sind
relate to ganja and charass, both of which consumed.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Supply of ganja and charas in its relation to prohibition.<font
face="Arial"></b><font size="4"> </font></font> </p>

<p>567. A few remarks, however, recapitulating the local
conditions of ganja and charas will not be out of place. Charas
is practically a foreign article. Small amounts are imported from
Nepal and Gwalior, but they may be left out of the account. The
bulk comes from Yarkand through the Himalayan passes, or to a
much smaller. degree from offer parts of Central Asia through the
routes on the frontier of Afghanistan. It would not be a very
difficult matter to stop these imports, though the co-operation
of the Kashmir Darbar would be necessary in regard to Yarkand
charas. It may, therefore, be accepted that the supply of charas
might be cut off without much difficulty, though, as this article
forms the principal import from Yarkand, the prohibition of
charas would paralyse, if not extinguish, the trade with this
country. In regard to ganja, the problem is more complex. Ganja
is regularly cultivated in Bengal, the Central Provinces, Madras,
Bombay, and Berar. In Bengal and the Central Provinces, the
cultivation of the hemp, plant for its production is under
complete control. In Berer cultivation is only permitted under
license. In the other tracts of British territory it is not
directly Controlled. Assuming that control is possible in these
tracts, it does not follow that it would be equally possible to
prevent cultivation altogether. Moreover, there still remains a
considerable amount of production in many of the Native States
all over India. To induce these States to prohibit cultivation
would be a difficult matter, and, even if this were done, the
suppression of illicit cultivation would offer the most serious
difficulties. For, though ganja of good quality requires some
cultivation and tending, the evidence before the Commission tends
to establish the fact that ganja of an inferior kind can be
manufactured from the spontaneous or casual growth which is found
near human habitations and amidst cultivation of other crops in
many parts of India. While, therefore, it cannot be asserted that
the task of preventing the manufacture of ganja is an impossible
one, it would certainly at the present time be attended with
considerable difficulty.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions of the witnesses regarding prohibition of ganja
and charas. </b></p>

<p>568. The question addressed to the. witnesses regarding the
prohibition of the hemp drugs (No. 35) was so framed as to elicit
in the first place opinions as to the feasibility of such. a
measure. The considerations bearing upon the subject were also
set forth in the form of subsidiary questions. The question
whether the witnesses advocated prohibition. was not specifically
put, but it is not difficult, comparing the answers to the
questions above mentioned with those relating to other questions,
to decide what the opinion of each witness is on this question.
Those who hold decided views have no doubt generally stated them
in some portion of their answers, and at all events ample
opportunity of doing so was afforded them. A larger number of the
witnesses have contented themselves with merely giving an
affirmative or negative answer to the questions on .the subject.
It is impossible to attach much importance to such answers. The
Commission have abstracted them and considered them, but they
feel bound to give far more weight to the opinions of witnesses
whose replies show that they have formulated an opinion, on the
desirability of prohibition. Some account will now be given of
these answers.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions regarding prohibition of ganja and charas.</b> </p>

<p><i>569. </i>Out of the total of 1,193 witnesses, 575 have
expressed a decided opinion on the question of prohibition. Of
these only 99 advocate it in their answers. The remainder are
against it. The classification of these witnesses is shown in the
following table:<br>
</p>

</p>

<p>Thus, not only is there a very large preponderance of opinion
against prohibition, but the preponderance is specially marked
among superior Civil officers. The only witnesses indeed of the
latter class who favour prohibition are three in the Punjab,
where charas and not ganja is consumed.<br>
</p>

<p>The most important of these opinions on either side will now
be specified. The most forcible opinions in favour of prohibition
will be quoted at some length in order that the argument for this
view may be .thoroughly appreciated. The opinions against
prohibition are too numerous to be quoted, but the witnesses will
be named under headings setting forth the most prominent views
expressed. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Bengal opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja</b> </p>

<p>570. The Bengal witnesses in favour of prohibition of ganja
consist of a Sub-Deputy Collector, an Assistant Surgeon. two
Medical Practitioners, an Honorary Magistrate, two zamindars, two
pleaders, a delegate from the Indian Relief Society, Calcutta,
the Secretary to the Band of Hope, Faridpur, the Secretary to the
Bogra Medical Society, and two Missionaries. The Commission
cannot find much to quote from these opinions, but the following
are the most forcible: </p>

<p><i>(238) Delegate, Indian Relief Society, Calcutta, Babu
Amrita Krishna Mullick, B.A., B.L.: </i>After quoting official
and medical opinions relating to the injuriousness of ganja, the
Society, endeavours to show that the cultivators of the hemp
plant lose largely by their occupation, and maintains that it is
the duty of the Government to come to their rescue by abolishing
it. The society maintains that the privation to the consumers
would not be serious, and that it is difficult to suggest any
drug more deleterious than ganja to which they could take. The
Society contends that the alleged religious sanction to the use
of the drugs is a fallacy, and refers to the opinions of several
pandits in support of this view. The Society argues that to meet
the deficit in the revenue, which would be about lakhs per annum,
the salaries of European officers should be cut down, the duties
on cotton goods re-imposed and the income-tax increased with an
enhanced taxable minimum. Savings would be effected by reduction
of establishment and by decreased cost of lunatic asylums.<br>
</p>

<p><i>(286) Secretary, Band of Hope Temperance Society, Faridpur,
Babu Purna Chandra Maitra: </i>&quot;This Society begs to urge
upon the Commission to consider the justice and propriety of a
just, benign, and Christian Government to allow cultivation and
sale of a drug which has been excluded from some countries, and
in England doubly protected in the poison list.&quot; The witness
argues that the drug&quot; has been unreservedly condemned by
eminent doctors as one of the most dangerous poisons known, as
the most potent cause of lunacy, and as the most pernicious and
deleterious of all excitants ever in use in any country.&quot; He
admits that there are a number of yogis, sanyasis, fakirs, and
mendicants addicted to ganja smoking, but states that ganja
smoking forms no part of their religion, and there is not a
single Hindu or Muhammadan religious book which sanctions the use
of ganja. &quot;No real disaffection can under the benign rule of
the British Government be seriously apprehended, and, even in the
event of there being such apprehension, the fact should not be
lost sight of that the Government in this case will have the
support of the bulk of the population.&quot; He alleges that
ganja produces crime, and that the taxation, amounting to 22
lakhs, is a drain on the poverty-stricken and half-famished
people of Bengal. He finds it difficult to suggest a substitute
for ganja, but liquor may be one, and a peculiar preparation of
strong tobacco may also serve the purpose. </p>

<p><i>(134) Secretary to Bogra Medical Society (10 members),
Pyari SankerDass </i>Gupta, L.M.S.: &quot;the prohibition will
give rise to no political danger. For the ganja smokers have very
little influence over society. The Government has faced questions
of a greater religious character, as the Suttee or the Age of
Consent Act, with boldness. This is comparatively a minor
question affecting only depraved men.&quot; </p>

<p><i>(203) Rev. W. B. Phillips, Missionary.: </i>&quot;What<i> </i>with
liquor and opium and hemp drugs of various kinds, all licensed by
Government, it does seem as if the population were terribly
exposed to degrading influences. It is not my province to face
the difficult task of dealing with these evils; and I sincerely
sympathize with the Government in the heavy duty of solving the
grave problems involved. But I do feel it my duty to set forth as
strongly as possible the assurance that very much mischief is
being worked in the country by the various intoxicants so freely
and largely sold. I hardly care to distinguish between opium,
alcohol, and ganja. I regard them all as bad. My mind is so
impressed with the evil effects of excessive use that I do not
care to consider the moderate use. I would wish Government to
begin with ganja, to proceed with little delay-against opium, and
then tackle alcohol. I prefer this as a matter of policy, as
ganja is easiest dealt with I am prepared to prohibit all three
intoxicants on account of the evil which I see done by them. </p>

<p><i>(81) Kali Das Mukerji, Sub-Deputy Collector: </i>After
advocating prohibition of ganja on the grounds of the evil
effects, and stating that there would be no danger from the
discontent caused owing to the small number of the consumers, the
witness proceeds: &quot;The<i> </i>reasons usually put forward in
favour of ganja consumption are as follows: (1) that Hindu friars
and jogis cannot do without it, for it helps them in their
religious contemplation, and sustains them under severe exertion
and exposure; (2) that it is a safeguard against disease in
malarious tracts; and (3) that it serves the labouring classes as
a refreshing stimulant, alleviating fatigue. I do not think that
any of these reasons is conclusive, though plausible. In fact,
none of them stands the test of close examination. If any
intoxicating drug is at all necessary for friars and jogis
alcohol, opium or siddhi may serve the purpose. Eight kinds of
intoxicating drugs are prescribed in the Tantras for Hindu
devotees, and it is optional with them to take any if they care
to do so at all. That ganja is a safeguard against disease in
malarious tracts is not necessarily true Even as a stimulant and
remover of fatigue, ganja has very little to recommend it to the
labouring classes A careful observation is sure to establish the
fact that any ordinary labourer whose only stimulant is tobacco
is on the whole a better workman than his ganja consuming
brother.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against prohibition of ganja in Bengal.</b> </p>

<p>571. It is impossible to quote the mass of opinion against
prohibition of ganja, but the following analysis of some of the

these opinions :-- <br>

</p>

<p><b>Assam.Assam.Opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja.</b>
</p>

<p>572. The opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja in Assam
are those of a Civil Surgeon, the Secretary to the Tezpur Raiyats
Association, the Secretary to the Upper Assam .Association, a
merchant, and a pensioned Overseer, Public Works Department, and
member of a Local Board. There is nothing especially to note in
these opinions. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against.</b>. </p>

<p>573. Against prohibition we have the Commissioner of the Assam
Valley, the Commissioner of Excise, the Director of Land Records
and Agriculture, an Officiating Deputy Commissioner, a Civil
Surgeon, an Extra Assistant Commissioner, a medical practitioner,
four pleaders, and four planters.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Mr. Driberg,</i><b><i> </i></b><i>Commissioner of Excise</i>,
says: &quot;It would be useless to prohibit the use of ganja in a
province like Assam, surrounded as it is by independent hill
people, who would cultivate it in their hills and smuggle it down
with little risk of detection. Any prohibition will only lead to
the increase of illicit consumption and to the secret use of the
drug, which would be decidedly bad; of course, stop cultivation
in Bengal, and the prohibition of the use of excise ganja could
be enforced; but there would be serious discourse, though in this
province it might not amount to a political danger, and the
prohibition would be followed by recourse to opium, and in some
cases to alcohol.&quot; The evidence of planters tends generally
to show that the use of ganja by the garden coolies, who (except
in the western districts of the Assam Valley and those of the
Surma Valley, all of which border on Bengal) are the principal
consumers, produces no serious effects. There is nothing in any
of the Assam evidence to controvert these views. <br>
</p>

<p><b>North-Western Provinces.Opinions in favour of prohibition
of ganja and charas.</b> </p>

<p>574. The advocates of prohibition of ganja and charas in the
North-Western Provinces are as follows: 6 subordinate civil
officers, 9 subordinate medical officers and private medical
practitioners, and 18 non-officials. Butfew of these witnesses
give any reasons for their opinions. And the Commission are not
able to quote any one of them as having any special weight. The
only opinion which it appears worth while to quote is that of a
Collector (Mr. Addis (4), who does not, however, specifically
recommend prohibition. He says: &quot;It probably would be
feasible to prohibit the use of all these drugs. Public opinion
is against their use, and the people are very obedient to
authority. The prohibition would certainly lead to the increased
use of opium and alcohol.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against prohibition.</b> </p>

<p>575. On the other hand, the opinions against prohibition are
very strong. The following is an analysis of some of the most
important:- </p>

<p><i>(1) Prohibition impossible or unnecessary, or could not be
enforced without a large preventive establishment.</i> </p>

<p>(1) Hon'ble A. Cadell, Member, Board of Revenue.(5) Mr.
Stoker, Commissioner of Excise(12) Mr. Brownrigg, Officiating

<p><i>(3) Prohibition might lead to use of dhatura or other
intoxicants worse than ganja or charas.</i> </p>

<p>(6) Mr. Stoker, Commissioner of Excise.(15) Mr. Ferard,
Collector (28) Mr. Bruce, Assistant Collector.(51) Thakur Tukman
Singh, Deputy Collector. Punjab 576. The advocates of the
prohibition of charas Opinions for prohibition of charas. in the
Punjab are as follows:-- 3 superior civil officers, 3 subordinate
civi1 officers, 2 subordinate medical officers, and 10
non-officials.It may be noted that <i>Mr. Ogilvie, Financial
Commissioner in charge of Excise (2), </i>records the following
opinion: &quot;I am inclined to hold the opinion, though I am not
quite satisfied on the subject, that the use of charas is so
deleterious that it might be permissible, both on grounds of
morality and utility, for its use to be prohibited or for the
price of the drug to be so artificially raised as to confine its
consumption to a very small number indeed. The reason why I say
that I am not quite satisfied on the point is because I have not
sufficiently investigated the facts. All that I can, therefore,
say with certainty is that my opinion tends to the direction
above indicated I would observe, however, with regard to the
Yarkand trade that the imposition of a duty so high as to be
practically prohibitive would very considerably injure that
trade, . because the Yarkand trader in exchange for the churns
takes back the products of the Punjab to his own country or to
Kashmir. The extinction or serious injury of the Yarkand trade
would, of course, be a very regrettable circumstance. On the
other hand from my personal knowledge as Deputy Commissioner of
the Dera  Ismail Khan District, I would say no harm would
accrue to general trade on the western border from the
prohibition of churns.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Mr. Coldstream. Deputy Commissioner (5), </i>though he does
not seem to have formed a definite opinion regarding the moderate
use of the drugs, says: &quot;The <i>gradual </i>stoppage of
import of ganja and charas might be tried. It is not as yet a
very widely-spread habit, but it might grow. It would cause gent
pain and discontent if the prohibition were sudden and
comprehensive, but this would not amount to political danger. A
prohibitory measure regarding ganja and charas would no doubt be
followed at once by a recourse to opium and alcohol. I can quite
believe the moderate occasional use of the drugs may be
comparatively harmless, but I am not aware that they are commonly
used occasionally and in moderation. They may, however, be so
used for all I know.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson, Deputy Commissioner (14), </i>says that he
should like to see the experiment made in selected districts of
prohibiting trade in charas (and bhang) all together. As regards
charas, he thinks the prohibition would be feasible, as it is
imported, and the discontent would be insignificant. knows of no
class, such as labourers, who take the drug in moderation as an
ordinary stimulant. Among fakirs and other excessive consumers,
he thinks the use produces great evils, and that there is no more
harmful drug which they are likely to take to. He does not know
anything of the use of dhatura except its administration as a
poison. He thinks sudden prohibition would be cruel. He would
therefore begin by taxation and gradually raise it, leaving the
question of total prohibition to be decided by experience. The
evidence of <i>Arjan Singh, Extra Assistant Commissioner </i>(19),
is much to the same effect, but he states that the use of dhatura
is general among the followers of Siva at the Shivratri in the
Dera Ghazi Khan district. He says it is taken in very small
quantities, so that its effect is almost imperceptible. <i>General
Millet (69), </i>formerly District Superintendent of Police,
would like to see all intoxicants prohibited which cannot be
proved to be actually necessary. He thinks gradual prohibition of
the hemp drugs feasible, and that educated, intelligent native
public opinion, which to a great extent leads that of the lower
classes, would support prohibition. Discontent at first among the
degraded classes would be inevitable, but there would be no
political danger, though tact and discretion would be needed and
calm-minded European officials at the helm. He fears that
recourse to alcohol would be the result. <i>Shekh Riaz Husain,
zamindar (67), </i>thinks that &quot;having regard for the
welfare and good of the people which the British Government has
in view, the prohibition of the hemp drugs (including bhang) is
imperatively necessary. Loyal and intelligent subjects and
well-wishers of the country would welcome the prohibition, though
the unscrupulous habitual consumers would indeed dislike it. But
as it would be for the good of the people, it is not hoped that
any class of persons would resent it. The enforcement of the
prohibition should be effected like other new laws and
regulations, exceptions being made to some extent in the case of
the existing old habitual consumers, because its sudden stoppage
would cause them serious privation. The discontent resulting
would not amount to a political danger. If it were possible to
make charas as expensive as alcohol, that would be one way of
dealing with the subject.&quot;<i>Sardar Sujan Singh, Rai
Bahadur, Contractor (59), </i>considers charas as certainly most
injurious, and thinks its use should most certainly be
prohibited. It does no good to anybody. There are not many <i>kahars
</i>who take it. Those who do, go to the bad. He does not know of
the use. of dhatura as an intoxicant. The use of madak and chandu
is more injurious than charas, and they also should be prohibited
as well as liquor. He would not recommend immediate prohibition,
but would put on such a tax, increasing it gradually, as to make
it impossible for the majority of people to buy them at all.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Dr. H. M. Clark, Missionary (46), </i>would like to see
charas prohibited if it were possible, He thinks. however, that
alcohol does more harm than charas. He cannot believe that a
moderate use of charas is possible. Fakirs and devotees are the
chief consumers. <i>Devi Dayal, Editor of the Kaitistha Mitra,*
Lahore, </i>circulation 300 copies (83), says: &quot;If charas be
called poison (fatal, killing, murdering drug), it is not an
exaggeration of any kind. It is a great vice to smoke charas. May
God not give this even in the lot of a foe. Only just people as
have bad luck get engaged in this vice. Government will do their
subjects a very great obligation by saving them from early death
and whirlpool of destruction and ruin. My present belief is that
there is no such thing as moderation in the use of chards,
because, when a c<i>harsi </i>visits another, he offers him the c<i>hillum,
</i>and they smoke in company. The smoke is thus repeated
frequently.&quot; Consumers acknowledge that they would have no
complaint; and if Government were to prohibit the use of charas
to-morrow, the bad habit would die out of itself. <i>Ganesh Das,
Pleader, and President, Sarin Sabha, Hoshiarpur </i>(77): Charas
jogis, sanyasis, and suthra fakirs, andis consumed by shoemakers,
musicians, by some Khatris and Brahmins. The physical effects are
very bad, and most consumers become incapacitated for work and
lead a miserable life. The subcommittee of the Sarin Sabha
appointed to consider the subject recommend prohibition. Enquiry
was not made from medical experts. Consumers would not take to
other intoxicants, because the intoxication of chards is not like
that of opium or other intoxicants. The greatest loss would be
that of the traders of Hoshiarpur and Amritsar, who take
merchandise to Ladakh and Yarkand and bring back charas.<br>

<p><b>Madrass </b><b><tt>Opinions in favour </tt></b><b>of </b><b><tt>the
prohibition of ganja</tt></b> </p>

<p>580. The Madras witnesses in favour of prohibition are a Civil
Surgeon, a subordinate civil officer, a medical practitioner, a
Hindu priest, and six missionaries. Dr. King, (85) says-
&quot;The restriction of the sale of ganja under conditions
similar to those required for poisonous drugs in Great Britain
would be an unqualified blessing to the country, thus contrasting
with the action taken against agitation which I believe to be
unnecessary and mischievous. I consider special measures should
be taken to restrain the use of ganja by sepoys, and especially
to prevent the young sepoy from acquiring the habit&quot; In oral
examination however, Dr. King, stated as follows- &quot;My
opinion of the effect of the moderate use in impairing the moral
sense and inducing laziness, etc., is a general impression and
not based on actual observation. My impression is based on the
fact that persons alleged to have been ganja smokers have
presented these characteristics. They were pointed out as
notorious ganja smokers. I did not discriminate in these cases
between the moderate and excessive use.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><i>Synd Mahmud(I22) </i>says: &quot;It<i> </i>is an
unquestionable fact that ganja, bhang, and charas are poisons,
and this fact is admitted by all. In my opinion their suppression
would be an act of virtue deserving of future reward, but it is
not advisable to suppress their use at once. Its suppression
should be regulated under certain rules without any loss to the
State. To the best of my knowledge and researches, alcohol cannot
be safely used as a substitute for ganja, charas, and
bhang.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><i>Rev. Mr. Laflamme </i>(153) speaking on behalf of the
Baptist Missionary Conferences of the Presidency, advocates
prohibition in these terms: &quot;Owing to the scarcity of shops
in these parts practical prohibition exists. Much that is
consumed is consumed illicitly. The introduction of the license
system Seems to have had no appreciable effect on the use of the
drugs. The ganja is nearly all grown by the consumers in their
own yards.&quot; &quot;The drugs should all be so safeguarded as
to prevent or minimize any possible harm resulting from their
abuse.&quot; &quot;The<i> </i>general sense of the people is
opposed to the use of the drugs.&quot; So far as the witness can
gather, the members of the Mission are. united in the belief that
in these parts hemp drugs are far less injurious than opium and
alcohol; thus far that the latter are not only much more
extensively used, but much more baleful in, their effects. Two
other missionaries, though neutral in opinion, are worth quoting <i>Rev.
Mr. Pittendrigh Missionary (160) </i>says that he would have
ultimate prohibition in view if possible, but there is not much
ground for special interference in anything that he has seen.
Another Missionary, the <i>Rev. Mr. Goffin. </i>(145), cannot
undertake to criticise the present or any system of exise
administration. His impression is that Government would be wise
to adopt strictly &quot;let-alone&quot; policy, leaving it to the
spread of education and enlightenment among the people to prevent
and lessen all its effects. The province government should be
carefully to watch such effects, and wherever and whenever
necessary interfere with prohibitive legislation. Such necessity,
however, in his opinion would not often occur.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against prohibition</b> </p>

<p>581. Among those who are opposed to prohibition, the evidence

<p><b>Bombay. Opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja.</b> </p>

<p>582. For the prohibition of ganja or charas in Bombay and
Sind, we have the following advocates: in Bombay two mamlatdars,
a hospital assistant, and a medical practitioner; and in Sind a
health officer, two hospital assistants, and a. banker. There is
not much that need be quoted from the evidence of these
witnesses. It may be noted that the Hon'ble T. D. Mackenzie,
Commissioner of Abkari, etc. (1), holds that the policy of
Government in relation to the hemp drugs should be one of
restriction, as far as restriction, 'is possible, and that, if
absolute prohibition were possible, he thinks it would be a good
thing. Owing, however, to the fact that the territories of the
Bombay Presidency interlace so extensively with foreign
territory, and to the feeling which would be aroused among the
consumers and those who sympathize with them, it would in his
opinion be impossible or undesirable. The Secretary to the Arya
Samaj in Bombay (109) states that while fully sympathising with
the objects of the Commission, which are apparently understood to
be the restriction or prohibition of the drugs, the Arya Samaj
&quot;is of opinion that any Governmental action in the direction
of further restricting the preparation and sale of the drug will
be productive of very little good. The <b>' </b>* Samaj believes
that education of the masses is the only proper and effective .
remedy for correcting such baneful habits, and fears that any
compulsion in<b> </b>this matter is likely to drive the consumers
of these comparatively innoccuous drugs to the use. of more
injurious intoxicants that are plentifully supplied to the people
like the various preparations containing alcohol.&quot; The
Samaj.prays that the Government will devise measures for the
restriction of the sale of European liquor in India. and leave
the hemp drugs to themselves. The only<b> </b>thorough advocate
of prohibition whose opinion is worth specifying is Rao
SahibShesho Krisna Madkavi (41), who considers-such prohibition
very necessary and holds that, although there would be temporary
discontent among the consumers such discontent would not amount
to a political danger &quot;the<i> </i>people in this part of the
country being loyal and of mild nature. and the proportion of the
persons using bhang and ganja to the general population being too
small to be taken into consideration.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against prohibition</b> </p>

<p>583. On the other hand, the opinions against prohibition are
weighty. The following may be specially quoted:<br>
</p>

<p><i>(1) Prohibition impossible or unnecessary, or could not be
enforced without a large preventive establishment. Bombay</i> </p>

<p>(1) Hon'ble T. D. Mackenzie, Commissioner of Abkari, etc (3)
Mr. Vidal, Chief Secretary to Government. (10) Mr. Monteath,
CoIlector. (12) Mr. Cumine, Acting Collector. (53) Mr. Vincent,
C.I.E., officiating commissioner of Police. (110) Rai Bahadur
Vishvanath Keshava Joglekar, Merchant. (108) Daji Abaji Khare,
Honorary Secretary, East Indian Association. </p>

<p><i>Sind </i></p>

<p>(1) Mr. James, Commissioner in Sind. (26) Seth Vishindas
Nihalchand, Zamindar and Merchant. <br>
</p>

<p><i>(2) Prohibition would be strongly resented by religious
mendicants, or would be regarded as an interference with
religion, or would be likely to become a political danger.<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Bombay. </i></p>

<p>(l) Hon'ble T. D. Mackenzie, Commissioner of Abkari, etc. (2)
Mr. Reid, Commissioner ganja. Apart from all this, there is
another consideration which has been urged in some quarters with
a manifestation of strong feeling, and to which the Commission
are disposed to attach some importance, <i>viz.</i>, that to
repress the drugs in India and to leave alcohol alone would be
misunderstood by a large number of persons who believe, and
apparently not without reason, that more harm is done in this
country by the latter than by the former. The conclusion of the
Commission regarding bhang has been given in paragraph 564; under
all the circumstances they now unhesitatingly give their verdict
against such a violent measure as total prohibition in respect of
any of the hemp drugs.<br>
</p>

<p><b>II. The policy advocated is one of control and restriction
aimed at suppressing the excessive use and restraining the
moderate use within due limits (Chapter XlV, paragraph 586) <br>
</b></p>

<p><b>Policy in regard to hemp drugs.</b> </p>

<p><tt>586 </tt>Failing prohibition, the question arises, what
should be the policy of the Policy in regard to hemp drugs.
Government in regard to the hemp drugs? On this point some
important evidence has been recorded, and the Commission deem it
to be within the scope of their duty to state in general terms
their own conclusions. In the first place, then, they are of
opinion that in view of the harmful effects produced by the
excessive use, and in exceptional cases even by the moderate use,
of the drugs, the action of the Government should be directed
towards restraining the former and avoiding all encouragement to
the latter. The object should be to prevent the consumers, as far
as may be possible, from doing harm to themselves and to lessen
the inducements to the formation of the habit which might lead to
such harm In aiming at this object, however, other considerations
need to be kept in view. There is in the first place the question
of illicit consumption. If the restriction. imposed by Government
is counterbalanced by a corresponding increase in smuggling no
advantage is gained but, on the contrary, a moral wrong is done
to the community apart from the annoyance necessitated by such
restrictions. Than, if there is a legitimate use of the drugs,
restrictions should not be such as to make the exercise of this
use impossible. The Commission have formed the opinion that there
is a legitimate use of the hemp drugs, and that it exists
generally among the poorest of the population. Again, if the
restrictions lead to the use of more deleterious substances, or
even drive the people from a habit the evil of which is known to
another of which the evil maybe greater, they are no longer
justifiable. The policy of Government must be tempered by all
these considerations, and the neglect of any one of them may lead
to serious error. <br>

<p><b>Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report</b> </p>

<p><b>NOTE BY MR. G. A. GRIERSON, C.I.E., MAGISTRATE AND
COLLECTOR, HOWRAH, ON REFERENCES TO THE HEMP PLANT OCCURRING IN
SANSKRIT AND HINDI LITERATURE</b></p>

<hr>

<p>I have the honour to state that I have searched through all
the Sanskrit and Hindi books accessible to me, and to forward the
accompanying note on the references to the hemp plant occurring
in the literatures of those languages.<br>
</p>

<p>I have met the hemp plant in Sanskrit and Hindi literature
under various names. The principal are:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) Bhanga. </p>

<p>(2) Indracana. </p>

<p>(3) Vijaya or Jaya<br>
</p>

<p>The earliest mention of the word ganja which I have noted is
dated about the year 1300 A.D.<br>
</p>

<p>Whenever the word vijaya is used, it is doubtful whether the
hemp plant is meant, or the yellow myrobolan, as the words means
both. <br>
</p>

<p>The name Bhanga occurs in the Atharvaveda (say, B.C. 1400).
The hemp plant is there mentioned simply as a sacred grass.
Panini (say, B.C. 300) mentions the pollen of the hemp flower
(bhanga). In the commencement of the sixth century we find the
first mention of vijaya which I have noted. It is a sacred grass,
and probably means here the hemp plant.<br>
</p>

<p>The first mention of bhanga as a medicine which I have noted
is in the work of Sucruta (before the eighth century A.D.), where
it is called an antiphlegmatic. During the next four centuries
bhanga (feminine) frequently occurs in native Sanskrit
dictionaries in the sense of hemp-plant.<br>
</p>

<p>In the tenth century the intoxicating nature of bhang seems to
have been known: and the name <i>Indracana</i>, Indra's food,
first appears, so far as I know, in literature. Its intoxicating
power was certainly known in the beginning of the fourteenth
century. In a play written in the beginning of the sixteenth
century, it is mentioned as being consumed by jogis (Caiva
mendicants). It is there named &quot;Indra's food.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In later medical works it is frequently mentioned under
various names.<br>
</p>

<p>I append a more detailed account of the passages in which I
have noted the uses of the Indian hemp.<br>
</p>

<p>I may add that I have not traced in literature any difference
between the uses of the word ganja and the word bhanga, though
modern <i>kavirajas</i> tells me that they are distinct plants. <br>
</p>

<p>Cir. B.C. 1400. In the <i>Atharvaveda</i> (cir. 1400 B.C.) the
bhang plant is mentioned (11, 6, 15) once:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;We tell of the five kingdoms of herbs headed by Soma;
may it and <i>kuca</i> grass, and <i>bhanga</i> and barley, and
the herb <i>saha</i> release us from anxiety.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Here reference is evidently made to the offering of these
herbs in oblations.<br>
</p>

<p>The grammarian Panini (5, 2, 29) mentions <i>bhangukata</i>,
the pollen of the hemp flower, as one of his examples.<br>
</p>

<p>Cir. B. C. 300.<br>
</p>

<p>The fact that the pollen of this special flower was quoted is
worth noting.<br>
</p>

<p>Varahamihira in his <i>Brihatsamhita</i> (XLVIII, 39),
mentions <i>vijaya</i> as used with other grasses in the rotes of
the <i>Pusya</i>, bathing festival.<br>
</p>

<p>A.D. 504.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Vijaya</i> is this passage certainly means some plant or
other. The word may mean either the Indian hemp-plant or be a
synonym of <i>haritaki</i> (the yellow myrobolan). Dr. Hoernle
informs me that in the oldest medical words the word is explained
by commentators in the latter sense. It is doubtful what meaning
we are to adopt here. The word <i>may</i> mean the hemp-plant <i>bhanga</i>.
In the passage from the Atharvaveda, already quoted, amongst the
five plants special honoured as oblations, <i>bhanga</i> is
closely connected with the herb <i>saha</i>. So also in the
Brihatsamhita, <i>vijaya</i> is mentioned as one of a long list
of plants to be used in the offering, and the very next plant
mentioned is <i>saha</i>, which is apparently the same as <i>saha</i>.
This would encourage the theory that the <i>vijaya</i> of the
Brihatsamhita was more probably the same as the <i>bhanga</i> of
the Atbarvaveda. <br>
</p>

<p>In Sucruta (Ut. XI, 3) <i>Bhanga</i> is recommended together
with a number of other drugs as an antiphlegmatic.<br>
</p>

<p>Before the eighth century.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Vijaya</i> is mentioned in the same work as a remedy for
catarrh accompanied by diarrhea (Ut. XXIV, 20, and Ut. 39, page
415, 20), as an ingredient in a prescription for fever arising
from an excess of bile and phlegm. In these two passages,
however, <i>vijaya</i> is probably an equivalent of <i>haritaki</i>,
the yellow myrobolan, and does not mean hemp.<br>
</p>

<p>In the various <i>kosas</i>, or dictionaries, <i>bhanga</i> is
frequently mentioned as meaning the hemp-plant. Thus,<br>
</p>

<p>(1) <i>Amarakosa</i>, 2, 9, 20.<br>
</p>

<p>Cir. A. D. 500. (2) <i>Trikandacesa</i>, 3, 364.<br>
</p>

<p>Tenth or eleventh century(3) <i>Hemacandra's Anekarthakosa</i>,
2, 37.<br>
</p>

<p>Twelfth century. (4) <i>Hemakandra's Abhidhanacinlamani</i>,
1179. <br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Sarasundari</i> (date not known to me), a commentary on
the Amarakosa mentioned above, </p>

<p>Twelfth century by Mathureca, and quoted in the
Cabdakalpadruma, mentions that the seed of the <i>bhanga</i>
plant is the size of that of millet (<i>kalaya</i>).<br>
</p>

<p>Cakrapanidatta is said to have flourished under Nayapala, a
prince who reigned </p>

<p>Cir. 1050 A.D. in the eleventh century A.D. In his <i>Cabdacandrika</i>,
a medical vocabulary, he gives the following Sanskrit names for
bhang:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) <i>Vijaya</i> (victorious), (2) <i>Trailokyavijaya</i>
(victorious in the three worlds), (3) <i>bhanga</i>, (4) <i>Indracana</i>
(Indra's food), (5) <i>Jaya</i> (victorious).<br>
</p>

<p>These names seem to show that its use as an intoxicant was
then known.<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Rajanighantu</i> of Narahari Pandita adds the following
names to those given by </p>

<p>A.D. 1300. Cakrapanidatta in the <i>Cabdacandrika</i> above
mentioned: <br>
</p>

<p>(6) <i>Virapattra</i> (hero-leaved or the leaf of heroes), </p>

<p>(7) <i>Ganja</i>, </p>

<p>(8) <i>Capala</i> (the light-hearted), </p>

<p>(9) <i>Ajaya</i> (the unconquered), </p>

<p>(10) <i>Ananda</i> (the joyful), </p>

<p>(11) <i>Harsini</i> (the rejoicer)<br>
</p>

<p>and adds that the plant possesses the following qualities:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) <i>Katulva</i> (acridity); (2) <i>kasayatra</i>
(astringency); (3) <i>Usnatva</i> (heat); (4) <i>tiktatva</i>
(pungency); (5) <i>vatakaphapahatva</i> (removing wind and
phlegm); (6) <i>samgrahitva</i> (astringency); (7) <i>vakpradatva</i>
(speech-giving); (8)<i>balyatva</i> (strength-giving); (9) <i>medhakaritva</i>
(inspiring of mental power); (10) <i>cresthadipanatva</i> (the
property of a most excellent excitant).<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Carngadhrasamhita</i>, a medical work by Carngadhara,
the date of which is unknown, </p>

<p>Say A.D. 1500. but which must have been compiled during the
Muhammadan </p>

<p>period of Indian History, specially mentions (1, 4, 19) <i>bhanga</i>
as an excitant (<i>vyavayin</i>). In the same passage it mentions
opium.<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Dhurtasamagama</i>, or &quot;Rogues' Congress,&quot; is
the name of an amusing if coarsely </p>

<p>A.D. 1550. written farce of about the year 1500 A.D., the
author of </p>

<p>which was one Jyotirica. In the second act two Caiva
mendicants came before an unjust judge, and demand a decision on
a quarrel which they have about a nymph of the bazar. The judge
demands payment of a deposit before he will give any opinion. One
of the litigants says:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Here is my ganja bag; let it be accepted as a
deposit.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The Judge (<i>taking it pompously, and then smelling it
greedily</i>): &quot;Let me try what it is like (<i>takes a pinch</i>).
Ah! I have just now got by the merest chance some ganja which is
soporific and corrects derangements of the humours, which
produces a healthy appetite, sharpens the wits, and acts as an
aphrodisiac.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The word used for ganja in the above is <i>Indracana</i>
(Indra's food).<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Bhavaprakaca</i>, another medical work written by
Bhavadevamicra (cir. A.D. 1600), has as follows:<br>
</p>

<p>Cir. A. D. 1600.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Bhanga ganja matulani madini vijaya jaya<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Bhanga kaphahari tikta grahini pacani laghuh<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Tiksosna pittala moha -mada vag vahni vardhini<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Bhanga is also called <i>ganja, matulani, madini</i>
(the intoxicating), <i>vijaya</i> (the victorious), and <i>jaya</i>
(the victorious). It is antiphlegmatic, pungent, astringent,
digestive, easy of digestion, acid, bile-affecting; and increases
infatuation, intoxication, the power of the voice, and the
digestive faculty.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The <i>Rajavallabha, a materia medica</i>, by
Narayanadasa kaviraja, the date of which I </p>

<p>17th century. do not know, but which is quoted in the <i>Cabdakalpadruma,
and</i> is believed to be ancient, has the following:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Cakra-canam tu tiksno-snam moha-krit kustha-nacanam<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Bala-medha-gni-krit-clesma -dosa-hari rasayanam<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Jata mandara-manthanaj jala-nidhau piyusa-rupa pura<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Trailokye vijaya-prade 'ti vijaya cri-devaraja-priya<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Lokanam hita-kamyaya ksiti-tale prapta naraih kamada<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Sarva-&quot; tanka-vinaca-harsa-janani yaih sevita sarvada.
<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Indra's food (i.e. ganja) is acid, produces infatuation,
and destroys leprosy. It creates vital energy, the mental powers,
and internal heat, corrects irregularities of the phlegmatic
humour, and is an elixir vitae. It was originally produced, like
nectar, from the ocean by the churning with Mount Mandara, and
inasmuch as it gives victory in the three worlds, it, the delight
of the king of the gods, is called <i>vijaya</i>, the victorious.
This desire-fulfilling drug was obtained by men on the earth,
through desire for the welfare of all people. To those who
regularly use it it begets joy and destroys every anxiety.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Rasapradhipa</i>, a work, the date of which is unknown
to me, and which is quoted in </p>

<p>? Date. the <i>Cabdakalpadruma</i> mentions <i>jaya</i> as a
remedy for indigestion:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Ksaratrayam sutagandhou pancakolam idam cubham<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Sarvais tulya jaya bhrista tad-ardha cigruja jata<br>
</i></p>

<p>Natron, saltpetre and borax, mercury and sulphur, and the
prosperous five spices (long pepper, its root, <i>piper chaba</i>,
another pepper, and dry ginger). To these add an equal amount of
parched <i>jaya</i> and half of that amount of horse-radish (<i>moringa</i>)
and <i>jata</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>It is not certain whether <i>jaya</i> here means bhang or <i>Haritaki</i>
(yellow myrobolan). The word has both significations. The latter,
perhaps, suits the formula best.<br>
</p>

<p>In the <i>Rasaratna-samuccaya</i>, a work written in the south
of India, <i>jaya</i> is classified as a semi-poison,<br>
</p>

<p><i>Langoli visamustic ca karaviro jaya tatha<br>
</i></p>

<p>? Date<br>
</p>

<p><i>Tilakah kanako rkac ca vargo hy upavisatmakah.<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Langali</i> (Vanguiera spinosa), the root of the Nerium
odorum, <i>jaya</i> (Symplocos racemosa) <i>kanaka</i> and <i>ak</i>
(a kind of Euphorbia), are semi-poisonous.<br>
</p>

<p>Bhang is frequently mentioned by vernacular poets. The oldest
instance with which I </p>

<p>1400 A.D. am acquainted is the well-known hymn by Vidyapati </p>

<p>Tbakur (1400 A.D.), in which he calls Civa &quot;<i>Digambara
bhanga</i>,&quot; in reference to his habit of consuming that
drug. According to an old Hindu poem, on which I cannot now lay
my hands, Civa himself brought down the bhang plant from the
Himalayas and gave it to mankind. Jogis are well-known consumers
of bhang and ganja, and they are worshippers of Civa.<br>
</p>

<p>In folk-songs, ganja or bhang (with or without opium) is the
invariable drink of heroes before performing any great feat. At
the village of Bauri in Gaya there is a huge hollow stone, which
is said to be the bowl in which the famous hero Lorik mixed his
ganja. Lorik was a very valiant general, and is the hero of
numerous folk-songs. The epic poem of Alha and Rudal, or
uncertain date, but undoubtedly based on very old materials (the
heroes lived in the twelfth century A.D.), contains numerous
references to ganja as a drink of warriors. For instance, the
commencement of the canto dealing with Alha's marriage, describes
the pestle and mortar with which the ganja was prepared, the
amount of the intoxicating drink prepared from it (it is called <i>sabzi</i>)
and the amount of opium (an absurdly exaggerated quantity) given
to each warrior in his court.<br>
</p>

<p>That the consumption of bhang is not considered disreputable
among Rajputs may be gathered from the fact that Ajabes, who was
court poet to the well-known Maharaja Bishwanath Singh of Riwa,
wrote a poem praising bhang and comparing <i>siddhi</i> to the
&quot;success&quot; which attends the worshipper of
&quot;Hari.&quot; Here there is an elaborate series of puns. The
word <i>siddhi</i> means literally 'success,' and <i>hari</i>
means not only the god Hari, but also bhang. </p>

<p>NOTE BY BABU ABHILAS CHANDRA MUKERJI, SECOND INSPECTOR OF
EXCISE, BENGAL, ON THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF TRINATH WORSHIP IN
EASTERN BENGAL.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Date of origin</i>._In 1867 Babu Ananda Chandra Kali or
Kailai, of Dhamrai, a village in thana Sabhar of the Dacca
district, first started the worship at the house of his
father-in-law at Fattehpur in the Atia pargana of the Mymensingh
district (sub-division Tangail). <br>
</p>

<p><i>Antecedents of the originator</i>._Dhamrai is an important
village in the Dacca district noted for its car festival, which
is annually held in honor of a local idol named <i>Madhab Thakur</i>,
and which is witnessed by a large gathering of people.<br>
</p>

<p>Ananda Chandra received education at the Dacca Normal School.
After leaving school he served for some time as a pundit
(schoolmaster), and then entered the Police Department, but was
there only a short time. He is a Barendra Brahman and belongs to
a respectable family. He learnt to smoke ganja when he was only a
boy. His present age is 60 years. He has the reputation of being
a versifier. He smokes two pice worth of ganja every day.<br>
</p>

<p>He married at Fattehpur in the Mymensingh district. There he
introduced Trinath worship 27 years ago. A <i>panchali</i> (poem)
reciting the praises and exploits of Trinath was first published
at Dacca in 1871 and the first edition (1,000 copies) was sold in
a few months.<br>
</p>

<p><i>The circumstances under which the worship was first started</i>._Ananda
Chandra Kali was at the time living in the house of his
father-in-law. He was thinking of introducing the worship of a
common god, who might be worshipped by all classes, rich and
poor, Brahman and Chandal, and by all creeds, Saktas, Baishnavas,
and Shaivas, and the idea occurred to him of having the present
worship at which ordinary and inexpensive things, such as ganja,
oil, and betel-leaf, were alone to be used.<br>
</p>

<p>Trinath (from Sanskrit <i>Tri</i>, three, and <i>Nath</i>,
lord) is represented to be Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, the Hindu
Trinity in one.<br>
</p>

<p>Being a ganja-smoker himself, Ananda Kali may have also
thought that by introducing the worship he would be able to save
the ganja-smokers from disrepute, as then ganja could be consumed
in the name of a god and under colour of doing a religious or
pious act.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Religious aspect of the worship</i>._The following
translation of the Introduction to the <i>Trinath Mela</i>
Panchali gives some idea of the subject:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The universe consists of the earth, the heaven, and the
nether world, and Trinath is the lord of these three worlds.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;There was an incarnation of God in the form of Gour
(Chaitanya), who delivered the sinners by preaching the name of
Hari, but the Lord was not satisfied with this, and became
concerned for the created, and soon he became incarnate again.
Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, gods in three forms, manifested
themselves in one form. The one God, the Lord of the universe,
seeing the miseries of mankind, came to their deliverance. Ananda
(Ananda Chandra Kali, the originator) declares that the true and
sincere worshippers of Trinath are sure to obtain salvation.
Brahma, Bishnu, and Shiva met together and expressed their desire
to come to this world in one form to receive worship.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;He is a truly pious man who worships Trinath, and
blessings are showered on the worshipper.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The worship should be made in a form in which the rich
and the poor may equally join and may perform it easily.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Only three things, each worth one pice, are required for
this <i>puja</i> (form of worship). The things which please all
must be selected. The offering should consist of <i>siddhi</i>
(ganja), <i>pan</i> (betel-leaf), and oil, each worth one pice. <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The votaries should assemble at night and worship with
flowers. The ganja should be washed in the manner in which people
wash ganja for smoking. The worshipper must fill three <i>chillums</i>
with equal quantities of ganja, observing due awe and reverence.
When all the worshipers are assembled the lamp should be lit with
three wicks, and the praises of Trinath should be sung. As long
as the wicks burn, the god should be worshipped and his praises
chanted. The god should be reverentially bowed to at the close of
the puja. When the reading of the <i>Panchali</i> is finished,
those that will not show respect to the <i>Prasad</i> (the
offering which has been accepted by the god), <i>i.e. chillum</i>
of ganja, shall be consigned to eternal hell, and the sincere
worshippers shall go to heaven.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><i>How the worship spread</i>._Ananda Kali commenced the puja
with the aid of some ganja-smokers in the village of Fattehpur. A
large number of people consume ganja in the Dacca. </p>

<p>NOTE BY MR. J.M. CAMPBELL, C.I.E., COLLECTOR OF LAND REVENUE
AND CUSTOMS AND OPIUM, BOMBAY, ON THE RELIGION OF HEMP<br>
</p>

<p>To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in the
bhang leaf. As the wife of Vishnu, the preserver, lives in the
hysteria-curing <i>tulsi</i>, or Holy Basil, and as Shiva dwells
in the hysteria-curing <i>bel</i>, gle marmelos, so the
properties of the bhang plant, its power to suppress the
appetites, its virtue as a febrifuge, and its thought-bracing
qualities show that the bhang leaf is the home of the great Yogi
or brooding aascetics Mahadev.<br>
</p>

<p>So holy a plant should have special rearing. Shiva explains to
his wife, Parvati, how, in sowing hemp seed, you should keep
repeating the spell 'Bhangri,' 'Bhangi,' apparently that the
sound of that guardian name may scare the evil tare-sowing
influences. Again, when the seedlings are planted the same holy
name must be repeated, and also at the watering which, for the
space of a year, the young plants must daily receive. When the
flowers appear the flowers and leaves should be stripped from the
plant and kept for a day in warm water. Next day, with one
hundred repetitions of the holy name Bhangri, the leaves and
flowers should be washed in a river and dried in an open shed.
When they are dry some of the leaves should be burnt with due
repeating of the holy name as a <i>jap</i> or muttered charm.
Then, bearing in mind Vagdevata, or the goddess of speech, and
offering a prayer, the dried leaves should be laid in a pure and
sanctified place. Bhang so prepared, especially if prayers are
said over it, will gratify the wishes and desires of its owner.
Taken in the early morning such bhang cleanses the user from sin,
frees him from the punishment of crores of sins, and entitles him
to reap the fruits of a thousand horse-sacrifices. Such
sanctified bhang taken at daybreak or noon destroys disease.
Before the religious user of bhang stand the Ashtadevata or Eight
Guardians with clasped hands ready to obey him and perform his
orders. The wish of him who with pure mind pours bhang with due
reverence over the Ling of Mahadev will be fulfilled.<br>
</p>

<p>Such holiness and such evil-scaring powers must give bhang a
high place among lucky objects. That a day may be fortunate the
careful man should on waking look into liquid bhang. So any
nightmares or evil spirits that may have entered into him during
the ghost-haunted hours of night will flee from him at the sight
of the bhang and free him from their blinding influences during
the day. So too when a journey has to be begun or a fresh duty or
business undertaken it is well to look at bhang. To meet some one
carrying bhang is a sure omen of success. To see in a dream the
leaves, plant, or water of bhang is lucky; it brings the goodness
of wealth into the dreamer's power. To see his parents worship
the bhang-plant and pour bhang over Shiva's Ling will cure the
dreamer of fever. A longing for bhang foretells happiness: to see
bhang drunk increases riches. No good thing can come to the man
who treads under foot the holy bhang leaf.<br>
</p>

<p>So evil-scaring and therefore luck-bringing a plant must play
an important part in the rites required to clear away evil
influences. During the great spirit time of marriage in Bombay
among almost all the higher classes of Gujarat Hindus, of the
Jain as well as of the Brahmanic sects, the supplies sent by the
family of the bride to the bridegroom's party during their seven
days' sojourn includes a supply of bhang. The name of the father
who neglects to send bhang is held in contempt. Again, after the
wedding, when the bridegroom and his friends are entertained at
the house of the bride, richly-spiced bhang is drunk by the
guests. The Gujarat Musalman bride before and after marriage
drinks a preparation of bhang. Among the Pardeshi or North Indian
Hindus of Bombay bhang is given not only at weddings, but the
Pardeshi who fails to give his visitor bhang is despised by his
caste as mean and miserly. Another great spirit time during which
bhang plays an important part is the time of war. Before the
outbreak of a war and during its progress the Ling of Mahadev
should be bathed with bhang. Its power of driving panic
influences from near the god has gained for bhang the name of
Vijaya, the unbeaten. So a drink of bhang drives from the
fighting Hindu the haunting spirits of fear and wariness. So the
beleagured Rajput, when nothing is left but to die, after loosing
his hair that the bhang spirit may have free entrance, drinks the
sacramental bhang and rushing on the enemy completes his <i>juhar</i>
or self-sacrifice. It is this quality of panic-scaring that makes
bhang, the Vijaya or Victorious, specially dear to Mahadev in his
character of Tripur, the slayer of the demon Tripurasur. As Shiva
is fond of <i>bel</i> leaves, as Vishnu is fond of <i>tulsi</i>
leaves, so is Tripuresvar fond of bhang leaves. He who wishes to
obtain his desires must constantly offer bhang to Tripuresvar.<br>
</p>

<p>Bhang the cooler is a febrifuge. Bhang acts on the fever not
directly or physically as an ordinary medicine, but indirectly or
spiritually by soothing the angry influences to whom the heats of
fever are due. According to one account in the Ayurveda, fever is
possession by the hot angry breath of the great gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and shiva. According to another passage in the Ayurveda,
Shankar or Shiva, enraged by a slight from his father-in-law
Daksha, breathed from his nostrils the eight fevers that wither
mankind. If the fever-stricken performs the Viraya abhishek, or
bhang-pouring on the Ling of Shankar, the god is pleased, his
breath cools, and the portion of his breath in the body of the
fever-stricken ceases to inflame. The Kashikhanda Purana tells
how at Benares, a Brahman, sore-smitten with fever, dreamed that
be had poured bhang over the self-sprung Ling and was well. On
waking he went to the Ling, worshipped, poured bhang and
recovered. The fame of this cure brings to Benares sufferers from
fever which no ordinary medicine can cure. The sufferers are laid
in the temple and pour bhang over the Ling whose virtue has
gained it the name Jvareshwar, the Fever-Lord. In Bombay many
people sick of fever vow on recovery to pour bhang over a Ling.
Besides as a cure for fever bhang has many medicinal virtues. It
cools the heated blood, soothes the over-wakeful to sleep, gives
beauty, and secures length of days. It cures dysentery and
sunstroke, clears phlegm, quickens digestion, sharpens appetite,
makes the tongue of the lisper plain, freshens the intellect, and
gives alertness to the body and gaiety to the mind. Such are the
useful and needful ends for which in his goodness the Almighty
made bhang. In this praise of the hemp the Makhzan or great
Greek-Arab work on drugs joins. Ganja in excess causes abscess,
even madness. In moderation bhang is the best of gifts. Bhang is
a cordial, a bile absorber, an appetiser, a prolonger of life.
Bhang quickens fancy, deepens thought, and braces judgment. <br>
</p>

<p>As on other guardian-possessed objects, the cow, the Vedas, or
the leaf of the <i>bel</i> tree, oaths are taken on the bhang
leaf. Even to a truthful witness an oath on the bhang leaf is
dreaded. To one who foreswears himself the bhang oath is death. <br>
</p>

<p>So holy a plant must play a leading part in temple rites.
Shiva on fire with the poison churned from the ocean was cooled
by bhang. At another time enraged with family worries the god
withdrew to the fields. The cool share of a plant soothed him. He
crushed and ate of the leaves, the bhang refreshed him. For these
two benefits bhang is Shankarpriya, the beloved of Mahadev. So
the right user of bhang or of ganja, before beginning to drink or
to smoke, offers the drug to Mahadev saying, lena Shankar, lena
Babulnath: be pleased to take it Shankar, take it Babulnath.
According to the Shiva Purana, from the dark fourteenth of Magh
(January-February) to the light fourteenth of Asbadh (July-July),
that is, during the three months of the hot weather, bhang should
be daily poured over the Ling of Shiva. If not every day, bhang
should be poured at least during the first and last days of this
period. According to the Meru Tantra on any Monday, especially on
Shravan (July-August) Mondays, on all twelfths or <i>pradoshs</i>,
and on all dark fourteenths of <i>shivratris</i>, still more on
the Mahashivratri or Shiva's Great Night on the dark fourteenth
of Magh (January-February), and at all eclipses of the sun or
moon, persons wistful either for this world or for the world to
come should offer bhang to Shiva and pour it over the Ling. Not
every devotee of Shiva makes offerings of bhang. Such rites in
Bombay are seldom performed except in the Bhuleswar and Babulnath
temples and there only on special occasions. The bhang offered to
Mahadev is without pepper or other spice. It is mixed with water,
water and milk, or milk and sugar. It is poured over the Ling.
According to some authorities the offerer should not touch the
offered bhang. Temple ministrants Atits, Tapodhans, Bhojaks,
Bhopis, Bharadis, Guravas alone should drink it. If there are no
ministrants the remains of the offering should be poured into a
well or given to cows to drink. Other authorities encourage the
offerer to sip the bhang, since by sipping the bhang reaches and
soothes the Shiva-Shakti or Shiva-spirit in the sipper. On
certain special occasions during failures of rain, during
eclipses, and also in times of war libations of bhang are poured
over the Ling.<br>
</p>

<p>Vaishnavas as well as Shaivas make offerings of bhang. The
form of Vishnu or the Guardian to whom bhang is a welcome
offering is Baladev, Balaram, or Dauji, the elder brother of
Krishna. Baladev was fond of spirits, not of bhang. But Banias,
Bhatias, and other high class Hindus, not being able to offer
spirits, instead of spirits present bhang. In Bombay the offering
of bhang to Baladev, unlike the special offerings to Shiva, is a
common and every-day rite. Without an offering of bhang no
worship of Baladev is complete. Unlike the plain or milk and
sugared bhang spilt over the Ling, Baladev's bhang is a
richly-spiced liquid which all present, including the offerer,
join in drinking. Such social and religious drinking of bhang is
common in Bombay in the temple of dauji in Kalyan Kirparam lane
near Bhuleshwar. As in the higher class worship of Baladev the
liquor offering has been refined into an offering of bhang so it
is in the worship of Devi, Shiva's early and terrible consort. On
any Tuesday or Friday, the two weeks days sacred to Devi, still
more during the Navratra or Nine Nights in Ashwin or
September-October, those whose caste rules forbid liquor make a
pleasing spiced bhang. And as in the worship of Baladev all
present, worshipper and ministrant alike, join in drinking.
Shitaladevi, the Cooler, the dread goddess of small-pox, whose
nature, like the nature of bhang, is cooling, takes pleasure in
offerings of bhang. During epidemics of small-pox the burning and
fever of the disease are soothed by pouring bhang over the image
of Shitaladevi. So for the feverishness caused by the heats
especially to the old no cure equals the drinking of bhang.
Unlike spirits the tempter to flesh bhang the craver for milk is
pleasing to the Hindu religion. Even according to the straitest
school of the objectors to stimulants, while to a high caste
Hindu the penalty for liquor-drinking is death, no penalty
attached to the use of bhang, and a single day's fast is enough
to cleanse from the coarser spirit of <i>ganja</i>. Even among
those who hold stimulants to be devil-possessed penalty and
disfavour attach to the use of hemp drugs only when they are
taken with no religious object and without observing the due
religious rites.<br>
</p>

<p>At the other extreme of Hindu thought from the foes to
stimulants, to the worshippers of the influences that, raising
man out of himself and above mean individual worries, make him
one with the divine force of nature, it is inevitable that
temperaments should be found to whom the quickening spirit of
bhang is the spirit of freedom and knowledge. In the ecstasy of
bhang the spark of the Eternal in man turns into light the
murkiness of matter or illusion and elf is lost in the central
soul-fire. The Hindu poet of Shiva, the Great Spirit that living
in bhang passes into the drinker, sings of bhang as the clearer
of ignorance, the giver of knowledge. No gem or jewel can touch
in value bhang taken truly and reverently. He who drinks bhang
drinks Shiva. The soul in whom the spirit of bhang finds a home
glides into the ocean of Being freed from the weary round of
matter-blinded self. To the meaner man, still under the glamour
of matter or <i>maya</i>, bhang taken religiously is kindly
thwarting the wiles of his foes and giving the drinker wealth and
promptness of mind.<br>
</p>

<p>In this devotion to bhang, with reverence, not with the
worship, which is due to Allah alone, the North Indian Mussalman
joins hymning the praises of bhang. To the follower of the later
religion of Islam the holy spirit in bhang is not the spirit of
the Almighty. It is the spirit of the great prophet Khizr or
Elijah. That bhang should be sacred to Khizr is natural. Khizr is
the patron saint of water. Still more Khizr means green, the
revered colour of the cooling water of bhang. So the Urdu poet
sings 'When I quaff fresh bhang I liken its colour to the fresh
light down of thy youthful beard.' The prophet Khizr or the Green
prophet cries 'May the drink be pleasing to thee.' Nasir, the
great North Indian Urdu poet of the beginning of the present
century, is loud in the praises of his beloved Sabzi, the Green
one. 'Compared with bhang spirit are naught. Leave all things
thou fool, drink bhang.' From its quickening the imagination
Musalman poets honour bhang with the title <i>Warak al Khiyall</i>,
Fancy's Leaf. And the Makhzan or great Arab-Greek drug book
records many other fond names for the drug. Bhang is the
Joy-giver, the Sky-flier, the Heavenly-guide, the Poor Man's
Heaven, the Soother of Grief.<br>
</p>

<p>Much of the holiness of bhang is due to its virtue of clearing
the head and stimulating the brain to thought. Among ascetics the
sect known as Atits are specially devoted to hemp. No social or
religious gathering of Atits is complete without the use of the
hemp plant smoked in ganja or drink in bhang. To its devotee
bhang is no ordinary plant that became holy from its guardian and
healing qualities. According to one account, when nectar was
produced from the churning of the ocean, something was wanted to
purify the nectar. The deity supplied the want of a
nectar-cleanser by creating bhang. This bhang Mahadev made from
his own body, and so it is called <i>angaj</i> or body-born.
According to another account some nectar dropped to the ground
and from the ground the bhang plant sprang. It was because they
used this child of nectar or of Mahadev in agreement with
religious forms that the seers or Rishis became Siddha or one
with the deity. He who, despite the example of the Rishis, uses
no bhang shall lose his happiness in this life and in the life to
come. In the end he shall be cast into hell. The mere sight of
bhang cleanses from as much sin as a thousand horse-sacrifices or
a thousand pilgrimages. He who scandalises the user of bhang
shall suffer the torments of hell so long as the sun endures. He
who drinks bhang foolishly or for pleasure without religious
rites is as guilty as the sinner of <i>lakhs</i> of sins. He who
drinks wisely and according to rule, be he ever so low, even
though his body is smeared with human ordure and urine, is Shiva.
No god or man is as good as the religious drinker of bhang. The
students of the scriptures at Benares are given bhang before they
sit to study. At Benares, Ujjain, the other holy places yogis,
bairagis and sanyasis take deep draughts of bhang that they may
centre their thoughts on the Eternal. To bring back to reason an
unhinged mind the best and cleanest bhang leaves should be boiled
in milk and turned to clarified butter. Salamisri, saffron, and
sugar should be added and the whole eaten. Besides over the demon
of Madness bhang is Vijaya or victorious over the demons of
hunger and thirst. By the help of bhang ascetics pass days
without food or drink. The supporting power of bhang has brought
many a Hindu family safe through the miseries of famine. To
forbid or even seriously to restrict the use of so holy and
gracious a herb as the hemp would cause widespread suffering and
annoyance and to the large bands of worshipped ascetics
deep-seated anger. It would rob the people of a solace in
discomfort, of a cure in sickness, of a guardian whose gracious
protection saves them from the attacks of evil influences, and
whose mighty power makes the devotee of the Victorious,
overcoming the demons of hunger and thirst, of panic fear, of the
glamour of Maya or matter, and of madness, able to rest to brook
on the Eternal, till the Eternal, possessing him body and soul,
frees him from the haunting of self and receives him into the
ocean of Being. These beliefs the Musalman devotee shares to the
full. Like his Hindu brother the Mussalman fakir reveres bhang as
the lengthener of life, the freer from the bonds of self. Bhang
brings union with the Divine Spirit. 'We drank bhang and the
mystery I am He grew plain. So grand a result, so tiny a sin.'<br>

<p><b><u>REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. </u></b></p>

<p><b><u>APPENDIX<br>
</u></b></p>

<p><b>NOTE BY MR. J. M. CAMPBELL, C.I.E., COLLECTOR OF LAND
REVENUE AND CUSTOMS AND OPIUM, BOMBAY, ON THE RELIGION OF HEMP. <br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in the
bhang leaf. As the wife of Vishnu, the preserver, lives in the
hysteria-curing <i>tulsi, </i>or Holy Basil, and as Shiva dwells
in the dysentery-scaring <i>bel, AE</i>gle<i> </i>marmelos, so
the properties of the bhang plant, its power to suppress the
appetites, its virtue as a febrifuge, and its thought-bracing
qualities show that the bhang leaf is the home of the great Yogi
or brooding ascetic Mahadev. </p>

<p>So holy a plant should have special rearing. Shiva explains to
his wife, Parvati, how, in sowing hemp seed, you should keep
repeating the spell 'Bhangi', 'Bhangi', apparently that the sound
of that guardian name may scare the evil tare-sowing influences.
Again, when the seedlings are planted the same holy name must be
repeated, and also at the watering which, for the space of a
year, the young plants must daily receive. When the flowers
appear the flowers and leaves should be stripped from the plant
and kept for a day in warm water. Next day, with one hundred
repetitions of the holy name Bhangi, the leaves and flowers
should be washed in a river and dried in an open shed. When they
are dry some of the leaves should be burnt with due repeating of
the holy name as a <i>jap </i>or muttered charm. Then, bearing in
mind Vagdevata, or the goddess of speech, and offering a prayer,
the dried leaves should be laid in a pure and sanctified place.
Bhang so prepared, especially If prayers are said over it, will
gratify the wishes and desires of its owner. Taken in the early
morning such bhang cleanses the user from sin, frees him from the
punishment of crores of sins, and entitles him to reap the fruits
of a thousand horse-sacrifices. Such sanctified bhang taken at
day break or noon<i> </i>destroys disease. Before the religious
user of bhang stand the Ashtadevata or Eight Guardians with
clasped hands ready to obey him and perform his orders. The wish
of him who with pure mind pours bhang with due reverence over the
Ling of Mahadev will be fulfilled.<br>
</p>

<p>Such holiness and such evil-scaring powers must give bhang a
high place among lucky objects. That a day may be fortunate the
careful man should on waking look into liquid bhang. So any
nightmares or evil spirits that may have entered into him during
the ghost-haunted hours of night will flee from him at the sight
of the bhang and free him from their blinding influences during
the day. So too when a journey has to be begun or a fresh duty or
business undertaken it is well to look at bhang. To meet some one
carrying bhang is a sure omen of success. To see in a dream the
leaves, plant, or water of bhang is lucky; it brings the goddess
of wealth into the dreamer's power. To see his parents worship
the bhang-plant and pour bhang over Shiva's Ling will cure the
dreamer of fever. A longing for bhang foretells happiness: to see
bhang drunk increases riches. No good thing can come to the man
who treads under foot the holy bhang leaf.<br>
</p>

<p>So evil-searing and therefore luck-bringing a plant must play
an important part in the rites required to clear away evil
influences. During the great spirit time of marriage in Bombay
among almost all the higher classes of Gujarat Hindus, of the
Jain as well as of the Brahmanic sects, the supplies sent by the
family of the bride to the bridegroom's party during their seven
days' sojourn includes a supply of bhang. The name of the father
who neglects to send bhang is held in contempt. Again, after the
wedding<i>, </i>when the bride-groom and his friends are
entertained at the house of the bride, richly-spiced bhang is
drunk by the guests. The Gujarat .Musalman bride before and after
marriage drinks a preparation of bhang. Among the Pardeshi or
North Indian Hindus of Bombay bhang is given not only at
weddings, but the Pardeshi who fails to give his visitor bhang is
despised by his caste as mean and miserly. Another great spirit
time during which bhang plays an important part is the time of
war. Before the outbreak of a war and during its progress the
Ling of Mahadev should be bathed with bhang. Its power of driving
panic influences from near the god has gained for bhang the name
of Vijaya, the unbeaten. So a drink of bhang drives from the
fighting Hindu the haunting spirits of fear and weariness. So the
beleaguered Rajput, when nothing is left but to die, after
loosing his hair that the bhang spirit may have free entrance,
drinks the sacramental bhang and rushing on the enemy completes
his <i>juhar </i>or self-sacrifice. It is this quality of
panic-scaring that makes bhang, the Vijaya or Victorious,
specially dear to Mahadev in his character of Tripur, .the slayer
of the demon Tripurasur. As Shiva is fond of <i>bel </i>leaves,
as Vishnu is fond of <i>tulsi </i>leaves, so is Tripuresvar fond
of bhang leaves. He who wishes to obtain his desires must
constantly offer bhang to Tripuresvar. </p>

<p>Bhang the cooler is a febrifuge. Bhang acts on the fever not
directly or physically as an ordinary medicine, but indirectly or
spiritually by soothing the angry influences to whom the heats of
fever are due. According to one account in the Ayurveda, fever is
possession by the hot angry breath of the great gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and Shiva. According to another passage in the Ayurveda,
Shankar or Shiva, enraged by a slight from his father-in-law
Daksha, breathed from his nostrils the eight fevers that wither
mankind. If the fever-stncken performs the Vijaya abhishek, or
bhang-pouring on the Ling of Shankar, the god is pleased, his
breath cools, and the portion of his breath in the body of the
fever-stricken pleased to inflame. The Kashikhanda Purana tells
how at Benares, a Brahman, sore-smitten with fever, dreamed that
he had poured bhang over the self-sprung Ling and was well. On
waking he went to the Ling, worshipped, poured bhang this cure
brings to Benares sufferers from fever which no ordinary medicine
can cure. The sufferers are laid in the temple pour bhang ever
the Ling whose virtue has gained it the name Jvareshwar, the
Fever-Lord. Bombay many people sick of fever vow on recovery to
pour bhang over a Ling. Besides cure for fever bhang has many
medicinal virtues. It cools the heated blood, soothes the
over-wakeful to sleep, gives beauty,<i> </i>and secures length of
days. It cures dysentery and sunstroke, clears phlegm, quickens
digestion, sharpens appetite, makes the tonic of the lisper
plain, freshens the intellect, and gives alertness to the body
and gaiety to the mind. Such are the useful and needful ends for
which in<i> </i>his goodness the Almighty made bhang. In this
praise of the hemp the Makhzan or great Greek-Arab work on drugs
joins... Ganja in excess uses abscess, even madness. In
moderation bhang is the best of gifts. Bhang is a cordial, a bile
absorber, an appetizer, a prolonger of life. Bhang quickens
fancy, deepens thought, and Judgment. As on other
guardian-assessed objects, the cow, the Vedas, or the leaf oaths
are taken on the bhang leaf Even to a truthful witness an<i> </i>oath
on of the be1 tree, dreaded. To one who forswears himself the
bhang oath is death the bhang leaf. So holy a plant must play a
leading part in temple rights. Shiva on fire with the poison
churned from the ocean was cooled by bhang. At another time
enraged with family worries the fields. The cool shade .of a
plant soothed him. He crushed and of the leaves, and the bhang
refreshed him. For these two benefits bhang is Shankarpri , the
Mahadev. So the right user of bhang or of ganja, before beginning
to drinker smoke, offers the drug to Mahadev saying, lena
Shankar, lena Babulnath: be pleased to take Shankar, take it
Babulnath. According to the Shiva Parann, from the dark
fourteenth of Magh (January-February) to the light fourteenth of
Asbadh (June-July), that is, during the three months of the hot
weather, bhang should be daily poured over the Ling of Shiva
every day, bhang should be poured at least during the first and
last days of this period. According to the Meru Tantra on any
Monday, especially on Shravan (July-August) Mondays, on all
twelfths <i>pradoshs, </i>and on all dark fourteenths or <i>shivratris</i>
still more on the Mahashivratri or Shiva's Great Night on dark
fourteenth of Magh (January-February.), and at all eclipses of
the sun or moon, persons wistful either for this world or for the
world to come should offer bhang to Shiva and pour it over the
Ling. Not every devotee of Shiva makes offerings of bhang. Such
rites in Bombay are seldom performed except in the Bhuleswar and
Babulnath temples and there only on special occasions. The bhang
offered to Mahadev is without pepper or other spice. It is mixed
with water, water and milk, or milk and sugar. It is poured over
the Ling. According to some authorities the offerer should not
touch the offered bhang. Temple ministrants Atits, Tapodhans,
Bhojaks, Bhopis, Bharadis, Gutaras alone should drink it. If
there are no ministrants the remains of the offering should be
poured into a well or given to cows to drink. Other authorities
encourage the offerer to the bhang, since by<i> </i>sipping the
bhang reaches and soothes the Shiva-Shakti or Shiva-spirit in the
sipper. On certain social occasions during failures of rain,
during eclipses, and also in times of war libations of bhang are
poured ever the Ling. </p>

<p>Vaishnavas as well as Shaivas make offerings of bhang. The
form of Vishnu Or, the Guardian to whom bhang is a welcome
offering is Baladev, Bainram, or Dauji, the elder brother
Krishna. Baladev was fond of spirits, not of bhang. But Banins,
Bhatias, and other high class Hindus, not being able to offer
spirits instead of spirits the offering of bhang to Baladev,
unlike the special offerings to Shiva, present bhang. In Bombay,
without an offering of bhang no worship of Baladev is complete,
offerings to Shiva is a common and everyday rite. Unlike the
plain or milk and sugared bhang spilt over the Ling, Baladev's
bhang is a richly-spiced liquid which all present, including the
offerer, join in drinking. Such social and religious ions
drinking of bhang is common in Bombay in the temple of Dauji in
Kalyan' Kirparam lane near Bhuleshwar. As in the higher class
worship of Baladev the liquor offering has been refined into an<i>
</i>offering of bhang so it is in the worship of Devi, Shiva's
early and terrible consort. On any Tuesday or Friday, the two
week-days sacred to Devi, still more during the Navrata or Nine
Nights in Ashwin or September-October, those whose caste rules
forbid liquor make a pleasing spices bhang. And as in, the
worship of Baladev all present, worshipper and ,ministrant alike,
join in drinking. Shitaladevi, the Cooler, the dread goddess of
small-pox, whose nature, like the nature of bhang, is cooling,
takes pleasure in offerings of bhang. During epidemics of
small-pox the burning and fever of the disease are soothed by
pouring bhang over the image of Shitaladevi. So for the
feverishness caused by the heats especially to the old no cure
equals the drinking of bhang. Unlike<i> </i>spirits the tempter
to flesh bhang the craver for milk is pleasing to the Hindu
religion. Even according to the staitest school of the objectors
to stimulants, while to a high caste Hindu the penalty for
liquor-drinking is death, no penalty attaches to the use of
bhang, and a single day's fast is enough to cleanse from the
coarser spirit of ganja. Even among those who hold stimulants to
be devil-possessed penalty and disfavor attach to the use of hemp
drugs only when they are taken with no religious object and
without observing the due religious rites. </p>

<p>At the other extreme of Hindu thought from the foes to
stimulants, to the worshippers of the influences that, raising
man out of himself and above mean individual worries, make him
one with the divine force of nature, it is inevitable that
temperaments should be found to whom the quickening spirit of
bhang is the spirit of freedom and knowledge. In the ecstasy of
bhang the spark of the Eternal in man turns into light the
murkiness of matter or illusionand self is lost in the central
soul-fire. The Hindu poet of Shiva, the Great Spirit that living
in bhang passes into the drinker, sings of bhang as the clearer
of ignorance, the giver of'knowledge. No gem or jewel can touch
in value bhang taken truly and reverently. He who drinks bhang
drinks Shiva. The soul in whom the spirit of bhang finds a home
glides intothe ocean of Being freed from the weary round of
matter-blinded self. To the meaner man, still under the glamour
of matter or maya, bhang taken religiously is kindly thwarting
the wiles of his foes and giving the drinker wealth and
promptness of mind. In this devotion to bhang, with reverence,
not with the worship, which is due to Allahalone, the North
Indian Mussulman joins hymning the praises of bhang. To the
follower of the later religion of Islam the holy spirit in bhang
is<i> not </i>the spirit of the Almighty. Itthe spirit of the
great prophet Khizr or Elijah. That bhang should be sacred to
Khizr isnatural. Khizr is the patron saint of water. Still more
Khizr means green, the revered colour of the cooling water of
bhang. So the Urdu poet sings 'When I quaff fresh bhang I liken
its colony to the fresh light down of thy youthful beard.' The
prophet Khizr or the Green prophet cries ' May the drink be
pleasing to thee.' Nasir, the great North Indian Urdupoet of the
beginning of the present century, is loud in the praises of his
beloved Sabzi, the Green one. 'Compared with bhang spirits are
naught. Leave all things thou fool, drink bhang.' From its
quickening the imagination Musalman poets honour bhang with the
title <i>Warak al Khiyall, Fancy's </i>Leaf. And the Makhzan or
great Arab-Greek drug book records many other fond names for the
drug. Bhang is the Joy-giver, the Sky-flier, the Heavenly-guide,
the Poor Man's Heaven, the Soother of Grief. </p>

<p>Much of the holiness of bhang is due to its virtue of clearing
the head and stimulating the brain to thought. Among ascetics the
sect known as Atits are specially devoted to hemp. No social or
religious gathering of Atits is complete without the use of the
hemp plant. </p>

<p>smoked in ganja or drunk in bhang. To its devotee bhang is no
ordinary plant that became , holy from its guardian and healing
qualities. According to one account, when nectar was produced
from the churning of the ocean, something was wanted to purify
the nectar. The deity supplied the want of a nectar-cleanser by
creating bhang. This bhang Mahadev made from his own body, and so
it is called <i>angaj </i>or body-born. According to another
accountsome nectar dropped to the ground and from the ground the
bhang plant sprang. It was because they used this child of nectar
or of Mahadev in agreement with religious forms that thee seers
or Hishis became Siddha or one with the deity. He who, despite
the example of the Hishis, uses no bhang shall lose his happiness
in this life and in the life to come. In the end he shall be cast
into hell. The mere sight of bhang, cleanses from as much sin as
a thousand horse-sacrifices or a thousand pilgrimages. He who
scandalizes the user of bhang shall suffer the torments of hell
so long as the sun endures. He who drinks bhang foolishly or for
pleasure without religious rites is as guilty as the sinner of <i>lakhs
</i>of sins. He who drinks wisely and according to rule, be he
ever so low, even though his body is smeared with human ordure
and urine, is Shiva. No god or man is as good as the religious
drinker of bhang. The students of the scriptures at Benares are
given bhang before they sit to study. At Benares, Ujjain, and
other holy places yogis, bairagis and sanyasis take deep draughts
of bhang that they may Centre their thoughts on the Eternal. To
bring back to reason an unhinged mind the best and cleanest bhang
leaves should be boiled in milk and turned to clarified butter.
Salamisri, saffron, and sugar should be added and the whole
eaten. Besides over the demon of Madness bhang is Vijaya or
victorious over the demons of hunger and thirst. <i>By </i>the
help of bhang ascetics pass days without food or drink. The
supporting power of bhang has brought many a Hindu family safe
through. the miseries of famine. To forbid or even seriously to
restrict the use of so holy and gracious a herb as the hemp would
cause widespread suffering and annoyance and to the large bands
of worshipped ascetics deep-seated anger. It would rob the people
of a solace in discomfort, of a cure in sickness, of a guardian
whose gracious protection saves them from the attacks of evil
influences, and whose mighty power makes the devotee of the
Victorious, overcoming the demons of hunger and thirst, of panic
fear, of the glamour of Maya or matter, and of madness, able in
rest to brood on the Eternal, till the Eternal, possessing him
body and soul, frees him from the having of self and receives him
into the ocean of Being. These beliefs the Musalman devotee
shares to the full. Like his Hindu brother the Musalman fakir
reveres bhang as the lengthener of life, the freer from the bonds
of self. Bhang brings union with the Divine Spirit. 'We drank
bhang and the mystery I am He grew plain. So grand a result, so
tiny a sin.''<br>

<p>NOTE BY BABU ABHILAS CHANDRA MUKERJI. <br>
</p>

<p>NOTE BY BABU ABHIILAS CHANDRA MUKERJI, SECOND INSPECTOR OF
EXCISE, BENGAL, ON THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF TRINATH WORSHIP IN
EASTERN BENGAL,. '<br>
</p>

<p><i>Date of origin.--In </i>1867 Babu Annnda Chandra Kali or
Kailai, of Dhamrai, a village in thana Sabhar of the Dacca
district, first started the worship at the house of his
father-in- law at Fattehpur in the Atia pargana of the Mymensingh
district (sub-division Tangail). <i>Antecedent: of the
originator.--Dhamrai </i>is an important village in the Dacca
district for its car festival, which is annually held in honour
of a local idol named <i>Madhab Thakur, </i>and which is
witnessed by a large gathering of people. Ananda Chandra received
education at the Dacca Normal School. After leaving school he
served for some time as a pundit (schoolmaster), and then entered
the Police Department, but was there only a short time. He is a
Barendra Brahman and belongs to a respectable family. He learnt
to smoke ganja when he was only a boy. His present age Is 60
years. He has the reputation of being a versifier. He smokes two
pice worth of ganja every day. </p>

<p>He married at Fattehpur in the Mymensingh district. There he
introduced Trinath worship 27 years ago. A <i>panchali </i>(poem)
reciting the praises and exploits of Trinath was first published
at Dacca in 1871 and the first edition (l,000 copies) was sold in
a few months. </p>

<p><i>The circumstances under which the worship was first
started.-Ananda </i>Chandra Kali was at the time living in the
house of his father-in-law. He was thinking of introducing the
worship of a common god, who might be worshipped by all classes,
rich and poor, Brahman and Chandal, and by all creeds, Saktas,
Baishnavas, and Shaivas, and the idea occurred to him of having
the present worship at which ordinary and inexpensive things,
such as ganja, oil, and betel-leaf, were alone to be used.  <br>
</p>

<p>Trinath (from Sanskrit <i>Tri, </i>three, and Nath, lord) is
represented to be Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, the Hindu Trinity in
one. </p>

<p>Being a ganja-smoker himself Ananda Kali may have also thought
that by introducing the worship he would be able to save the
ganja-smokers from disrepute, as then ganja could be consumed in
the name of a god and under colour of doing a religious or pious
act. </p>

<p><i>Religious aspect of the worship.--The </i>following
translation of the Introduction to the <i>Trinath Mela </i>Panchali
gives some idea of the subject : </p>

<p>The universe consists of the earth, the heaven, and the nether
world, and Trinath is the lord of these three worlds.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;There was an incarnation of God in the form of Gour
(Chaitanya), who delivered the sinners by preaching the name of
Hari, but the Lord was not satisfied with this, and became
concerned for the created, and soon he became incarnate again.
Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, gods in three forms, manifested
themselves in one form. The one God, the Lord of the. universe,
seeing the miseries of mankind, came to their deliverance. Ananda
(Ananda Chandra Kali, the originator)declares that the true and
sincere worshippers of Trinath are sure to obtain salvation.
Brahma, Bishnu, and Shiva met together and expressed their
desire, </p>

<p>to come to this world in one form to receive worship. . </p>

<p>&quot;He is a truly pious man who worships Trinath, and
blessings are showered on the worshipper. </p>

<p><i>&quot;The </i>worship should be made in a form in which the
rich and the poor may equally join and may perform it easily. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Only </i>three things, each worth one pice, are
required for this <i>puja </i>(form of worship).. </p>

<p>The things which please all must be selected. The offering
should consist of <i>siddhi </i>(ganja),. <i>pan </i>(betel-leaf),
and oil, each worth one pice. . </p>

<p>&quot;The votaries should assemble at night and worship with
flowers. The ganja should be washed in the manner in which people
wash ganja for smoking. The worshipper must fill three <i>chillums
</i>with equal quantities of ganja, observing due awe and
reverence. When all, the worshippers are assembled the lamp
should be lit with three wicks, and the praises of Tri- should be
sung. As long as the wicks burn, the god should be worshipped and
his praises chanted. The god should be reverentially bowed to at
the close of the puja. When the reading of the <i>Panchali </i>is
finished, those that will not show respect to the <i>Prasad (the<br>
</i>offering which has been accepted by the god), i.e., chillum
of ganja, shall be consigned to. </p>

<p>eternal hell, and the sincere worshippers shall go to heaven.
, </p>

<p><i>How the worship spread.--Anauda </i>Kali commenced the puja
with the aid of some ganja smokers in the village of Fattehpur. A
large number of people consume ganja in the Dacca and Mymensingh
districts, and the worship soon became popular. In fact it spread
like wild-fire from one village to another among the
ganja-smokers. Those that were not in the habit of consuming
ganja also followed their example. </p>

<p>The following circumstances assisted the spread of the Worship
: </p>

<p>I.--The puja is open to all classes from Brahmans to Chandals
and to the rich and the poor. Caste does not stand in its way,
and it may be performed almost every day and in all seasons.<br>
</p>

<p>II.--The pup is a <i>Manarik Puja </i>(made in pursuance of a
vow on the fulfillment of the object desired).. People have been
led to believe that Trinath possesses the power of .healing the
sick and fulfilling desires, and .that those who. neglect his
worship meet with disgrace, while those who observe it <i>attain </i>success
in life. There are several stories m the Panchali narrated in
illustration of this statement. It is also popularly believed
that in the house where Trinath is worshipped cold: fever and
headache do not appear. </p>

<p>III.--This is a cheap form of worship. The puja can be
performed <i>by </i>even the poorest, only three pies being
required. </p>

<p>IV.--People of the lowest class can mix with those above them
without distinction of caste or creed on the occasion of these
pujas. </p>

<p>V.--Ganja eau be consumed by all in the name of a god, and the
practice cannot be looked down upon, because it is done under
certain forms and religious ceremonies. It is also popularly
believed that those who mock the worshippers of Trinath shall be
ruined and shall be the victims of misfortune. <br>
</p>

<p>The worship prevails not only among the poor, but also among
the well-to-do. The latter often entertain their friends after
the puja. </p>

<p>Women do not take any active part in the worship, but they
often listen to the reading. of the <i>Panchali.</i> </p>

<p>The worship is more or less general in the following districts
:--(1) Dacca, (2) Mymensingh, (3) Faridpur, (4) Backergunge, (5)
Noakhali, (6) Tippers, (7) Chittagong, (8) Bogra, (9) Sylhet, and
(10) Pabna (SerajgaDj side). .,, </p>

<p>The worship is on the decline. It is almost dying out among
the educated </p>

<p>]Jut among the masses it Still exists. </p>

<p>. I have ascertained the above facts from Dr. Chandra Sekhar
Kali (brother of the originator, Ananda Chandra Kali) and many
other respectable persons, and also from personal inquiries in
the Daces, Chittagong and Rajshahi divisions. <br>

<h1>THE OPIUM PROBLEM </h1>

<p><b>BY CHARLES E. TERRY AND MILDRED PELLENS</b> </p>

<p><b>1928</b> </p>

<p>CHAPTER I - EXTENT </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The number of individuals involved is probably what first
brings any problem to the attention of the public. It bears a
definite relationship to control and if it is demonstrated that a
problem is confined neither to a community nor to a section of
tile country, neither to one social group nor even to one race,
but is widespread and common to all, such facts should be used as
the basis for eliciting interest, for pointing out the need for
remedial measures, and for framing such measures. Likewise the
converse is true. A knowledge, therefore, of the extent of tile
problem with which we are concerned is a matter of importance and
should receive early consideration. </p>

<p>The attempts which we have made to secure an accurate estimate
of the number of chronic opium users in the United States at the
present time emphasize an unusual situation. We find estimates
varying all the way from a few thousand individuals to several
millions. One states that one hundred thousand to two hundred
thousand is the outside limit while another states that two
million or more is a conservative figure. The lay press, popular
magazines, and even scientific journals vary so widely in their
estimates of the number of sufferers from this condition that one
is justified in accepting none of them unreservedly and in
analyzing afresh all available means for the determination of the
actual facts. </p>

<p>It will be seen not only that no one is possessed of an
accurate knowledge as to the exact number of individuals
regularly using opium in this country today, but also that under
present conditions it is impossible to obtain such a figure.
There are several reasons why this is true. In the first place,
the fact that opium-using in any form is regarded by the general
public as alone a habit, vice, sign of weak will or dissipation
undoubtedly has caused the majority of users to conceal their
condition. This attitude presumably attributes to the individual
either a physical or mental inferiority the concealment of which
is quite natural. This factor applied before the problem ever
became a matter for official and legislative action and
undoubtedly became intensified when it was taken up officially
and the individuals desirous of solving it made their views the
basis of propaganda for control. With the advent of prohibitory
legislation and the consequent fear of legal involvement, it is
natural that even greater efforts were made by individuals
affected to conceal their condition. </p>

<p>Quite aside from this individual point of view is the fact
that only in cases where large doses of the drug are being
consumed can casual observation or even a fairly careful
examination determine the existence of the condition. There is a
popular belief extant that practically anyone can detect the
so-called &quot;dope fiend,&quot; that he is a miserable,
emaciated, furtive individual with pinpoint pupils, trembling
hands, sallow complexion and characterized by a varied group of
moral attributes, needing only to be observed to render
identification of the condition complete. As a matter of fact not
even one of these alleged characteristics need be present and it
is safe to say that in many cases only one or another of them
exists and by no means would suffice to give the ordinary
observer an idea of the true situation. It has been reported that
for many years husbands and wives, to say nothing of other
members of a family, have lived in complete ignorance of the
existence of this condition in one or the other and that quite
possibly the average physician, unaccustomed to dealing with the
condition, might have difficulty in determining its existence. </p>

<p>In view of what has been said it would seem quite evident that
there is no accurate knowledge as to the exact number of chronic
opium users in the country today, as it is apparent that, if the
condition is considered a physical, mental, or moral stigma and
if it is possible to conceal it from any but the most
scrutinizing examination unknown cases inevitably must exist.
This may be expected to continue as long as the present attitude
toward the user of these drugs exists with the social and
economic damage resulting from exposure, and the illicit traffic
offers a means of supply. That the illicit traffic exists to a
very marked degree we know; to suppose that the dangers of
disclosure are not appreciated by individual sufferers would be
to consider them lacking in ordinary intelligence. However, in
spite of the obvious difficulties in the way of an accurate
determination of the number of cases of chronic opium
intoxication, startling statements constantly are being made. </p>

<p>Although it is apparent that under present conditions the
difficulties in the way of arriving at exact knowledge or even an
estimate known to approach the number of opium users in the
United States are insurmountable, on a superficial examination
there would appear to be two methods available for attaining at
least a minimal figure. As it is common knowledge that opium is
not produced in this country and that therefore all opium used
must be imported, it is possible to secure through the proper
Government bureaus the quantity of opium legitimately imported.
By suitable calculations apparently it should be possible to
arrive at the total number of users, excluding those supplied by
the illicit traffic. Theoretically this could be accomplished by
subtracting from the amount imported for a given period the
amount exported and the amount used for therapeutic purposes not
connected with chronic opium intoxication and dividing the
resulting figure by the average amount consumed by the chronic
user for that period. This method has been used by some authors,
but there are several factors which vitiate the totals arrived
at. First, some writers have neglected to distinguish between
general importation figures and the figures dealing with
importations for consumption.* This at once makes for very
different totals as will be seen when it is stated that, for the
period of ten years 1911-1920 inclusive, these amounts differed
by about 400,000 pounds of opium. </p>

<p>*'General imports&quot; embrace imported articles entered at
the customs houses for immediate consumption and imported
articles entered for warehouse. &quot;Imports entered for
consumption&quot; embrace imported articles entered for immediate
consumption and imported articles withdrawn from warehouse for
consumption. </p>

<p>Another source of error enters in any attempt to allow for the
amount of opium and its derivatives employed for therapeutic
purposes not connected with chronic, opium intoxication. The
estimates as to the proportion of imported drug required for such
purposes have varied very widely and obviously where such large
figures are dealt with the resulting estimates vary considerably.
These allowances always seem to have been reached either in an
arbitrary fashion or upon a basis of incomplete facts. </p>

<p>Further so far as we know there has been made no study of a
sufficiently large and representative number of individual cases
under suitable conditions to permit of any definite statement as
to an average daily dose. For instance, it is well known that
certain cases continue for years on one or two grains or even a
fraction of a grain daily while others take such almost
unbelievable doses as eighty to one hundred or more grains a day.
Also, among a certain type, the amount stated as habitually
consumed by an individual may include the ration of one or more
other individuals unknown to the investigator. </p>

<p>As far as we know then there are two obstacles to the
determination through importation figures of a minimal figure for
the number of chronic opium users in this country at the present
time:-(1) the fact that the so-called &quot;legitimate
therapeutic needs&quot; are unknown and (2) the wholly
speculative nature of the &quot;average dose.&quot; In view of
these facts, all estimates as to the extent of this condition
based on importation figures however used are potentially
fallacious to such a great degree as to be practically valueless.
</p>

<p>The second method of determination is the employment of some
means for the taking of a census of opium users in a given
locality and adjusting it to the population of the country as a
whole. Aside from the fact that it would not include those users
who, by reason of their desire for concealment and consequent
dependence on illicit traffic for supply, could not be recorded
by<font size="1"> </font>such a survey undoubtedly would possess
a value not found in estimates based on importation figures in an
attempt to reach a minimal figure, inasmuch as it would be
definite and positive as far as it went. Of course, there is
possibility of error to a greater or less degree in this method.
The floating population, for example, cannot be disregarded, yet
this is a source of error common to every method of
census-taking. Further, local conditions such as population
composition, climate, race distribution, occupation, etc., are
influencing factors which tend to lessen the value of the
individual surveys as applied to the country as a whole.
Unfortunately, there have not been enough of these surveys made
in various sections to determine by comparison the degree to
which these factors operate. In what follows, the surveys which
we have reviewed and which represent investigations made in
different localities at different periods will be analyzed and
the features which tend to vitiate their application to the
country as a whole, for the period in which they were made, will
be pointed out. </p>

<p>'This factor does not enter into the early surveys which were
carried on when illicit traffic was unknown or practically
negligible. <br>
</p>

<p>Before examining the first definite figures of which we have
knowledge, contained in a survey reported by 0. Marshall in the
Annual Report of the Michigan State Department of Health of 1878,
it will be interesting to quote from some of the earliest authors
who refer to the extent of chronic opium intoxication in this
country. Their statements, however inexact, at least show that
the problem is by no means one of recent development but the
result, as we know it today, of a continuous growth probably
since Colonial days. What effect the war of the American
Revolution and that of 1812 had upon its spread we have not seen
indicated in any record we have consulted, but that the Civil War
gave it a considerable impetus seems definitely established.<br>
</p>

<p>Fitzhugh Ludlow-1867.3 </p>

<p>3 Ludlow, Fitzhugh-Harper's Magazine. August, 1867. </p>

<p>&quot;The habit is gaining fearful ground among our
professional men, the operatives in our mills, our weary serving
women, our fagged clerks, our former liquor drunkards, our very
day laborers, who a generation ago took gin. All our classes from
the highest to the lowest are yearly increasing their consumption
of the drug.&quot; </p>

<p>Horace Day-1868 <font size="1">.4 </font></p>

<p>4 Day, Horace-The Opium Habit. 1868. </p>

<p>&quot;The number of confirmed opium-eaters in the United
States is large, not less, judging from the testimony of
druggists in all parts of the country as well as from other
sources, than eighty to one hundred thousand . . . The events of
the last few years (Civil War) have unquestionably added greatly
to their number. Maimed and shattered survivors from a hundred
battlefields, diseased and disabled soldiers released from
hostile prisons, anguished and hopeless wives and mothers, made
so by the slaughter of those who were dearest to them, have
found, many of them, temporary relief from their sufferings in
opium.&quot; </p>

<p>Alonzo Calkins-1871.5 </p>

<p>Calkins calls attention to the increased use of opium in this
country from the year 1840. Basing his computations on the
importations of opium and the population figures for those years,
he reaches the following ratios of advance:<br>
</p>

<p><img src="op100001.gif" align="bottom" width="444" height="71">
</p>

<p>He gives in some detail the method by which he reaches these
figures which include &quot;a comparison of opinions given by
eighteen prominent apothecaries of New York City.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Such statistics,&quot; he asserts, &quot;fully presented
bear no equivocal interpretation.&quot; </p>

<p>Independent and collateral evidences, he believes, show that
&quot;opiummania, far from being restricted . . . to our cities .
. . is fast pervading the country-populations.&quot; </p>

<p>In the evidence he presents he quotes the following: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>&quot;Thus addresses </i>the writer, a physician and
    druggist of a New England city, Dr. S. S.: 'In this town I
    began business twenty years since. The population then at
    10,000 has increased only inconsiderably, but my sales have
    advanced from 50 pounds of opium the first year to 300 pounds
    now; and of laudanum four times upon what was formerly
    required. About 50 regular purchasers come to my shop, and as
    many more, perhaps, are divided among the other three
    apothecaries in the place. Some country dealers also have
    their quotas of dependents.' Such is no solitary record. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;In the <i>Portland Press, </i>IM, a correspondent
    sounds the alarm-note in these words: 'Very few of our people
    are aware how many habitual consumers of opium among us a
    careful scrutiny would disclose. In the little village of
    Auburn (of the neighborhood) at least fifty such (as counted
    up by a resident apothecary) regularly purchase their
    supplies hereabouts; and the country grocers, too, not a few
    of them, find occasion for keeping themselves supplied with a
    stock.' Corroborative accounts dome in from New Jersey and
    Indiana, from Boston at one extreme and from St. Louis at
    another, and from the impoverished South as well. In the
    Mississippi Valley particularly the use of stimuli of every
    name is fearfully on the increase (Pitcher, Comstock).&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>F. E. Oliver-1871.<br>
</p>

<p>In the third Annual Report of the State Board of Health,
Massachusetts, for the year 1871, there appears a chapter on the
use and abuse of opium written by this author. The writer
addressed the following questions to the physicians of
Massachusetts: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. Are preparations of opium used by the people except for
    the relief of Pain? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. We would like to know whether the injurious use of
    opium has increased of late years, and if so, the causes of
    such increase? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, these questions were not so framed as to elicit
the information which the author desired to obtain and, as he
himself states, the data secured are most incomplete although
suggestive. Less than one-half of the physicians addressed were
heard from, representing a little more than one-third of the
physicians of the state. In all 125 physicians replied, 40 of
these stating in answer to the first question that they knew of
no case of opium eating. The remaining 85 stated that the drug
was used to a greater or less extent in their respective
circuits. In many of the smaller towns where the
&quot;habit&quot; existed, the number of users was reported where
it could be ascertained, while in the returns from others such
terms as &quot;few,&quot; &quot;many&quot; and
&quot;several&quot; alone were given. In others again no mention
was made of numbers, so that the author was not able to arrive at
anything like an accurate computation. From the fragmentary data
so obtained the author states that the inference is unavoidable
that the &quot;opium habit&quot; is more or less prevalent in
many parts of the state and while it is impossible to estimate it
the number of users must be very considerable. </p>

<p>The writer further gives the following extract from a letter
received from Mr. S. Dana Hayes, one of the State Assayers: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;'In reply to your inquiries, it is my opinion that
    the consumption of opium in Massachusetts and New England is
    increasing more rapidly in proportion than the population.
    There are so many channels through which the drug may be
    brought into the State, that I suppose it would be almost
    impossible to determine how much foreign opium is used here;
    but it may easily be shown that the home production increases
    every year. Opium has been recently made from white poppies,
    cultivated for the purpose, in Vermont, New Hampshire and
    Connecticut, the annual production being estimated by
    hundreds of pounds, and this has generally been absorbed in
    the communities where it is made. It has also been brought
    here from Florida and Louisiana, while comparatively large
    quantities are regularly sent east from California and
    Arizona, where its cultivation is becoming an important
    branch of industry, ten acres of poppies being said to yield,
    in Arizona, twelve hundred pounds of opium.&quot;' <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;'That which is not used where it is produced,
    including the shipments from California and the West,
    together with inferior and damaged parcels of foreign opium
    received and condemned at this port, is sent to Philadelphia,
    where it is converted into morphis. and its salts, and is
    thus distributed through the country! <font size="1">Pt a</font>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his letter Hayes comments further on the use of opium and
morphin in family remedies such as cough mixtures and liniments
and in the dangerous so-called &quot;cures&quot; or &quot;Relief
for Opium-Eaters&quot; preparations. </p>

<p>'D. M. R. Culbreth in his &quot;Materia Medica and
Pharmacology&quot;, 3rd edition, 1903, states: </p>

<p>&quot;During the Civil War opium was cultivated in Virginia,
Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, being planted in September
and collected in May.&quot; </p>

<p>In the 6th edition of the same work the author states that
this opium was of high narcotic content. </p>

<p>Oliver also quotes extracts from letters replying to his
question as to the increase in tile <i>use </i>of opium, some of
which are reproduced below: </p>

<p>&quot;Clarksburg-'I think it on the increase, because doctors
prescribe it more indiscriminately now than formerly, thus
establishing the habit with the patient! </p>

<p>Eastham-2 I think the use of opium has slightly increased,
mostly among females.' </p>

<p>Swampscott-2 The use of opium in its various forms has
materially increased within the last ten years! </p>

<p>Westfield---I have reason to believe this practice exceedingly
common among certain classes of people, who crave the effect of a
stimulant, but will not risk their reputation for temperance by
taking alcoholic beverages.' </p>

<p>Worcester-2 I have talked with some of our most intelligent
apothecaries, who tell me that the use of opium has greatly
increased, especially among women. The reasons which one gave are
these: The doctors are prescribing it more to their patients, and
thus the habit is acquired. There is also the desire for Some
form of stimulant. Alcoholic stimulants being prohibited, many
have resorted to the use of opium.' </p>

<p>Another gave it as his opinion that 'the use of opium in its
various preparations is increasing among the people as a
stimulant, and is now being used to an alarming extent. I believe
this to be due largely to the unpopularity and restricted use of
alcoholic liquors. I believe there is a natural craving for some
artificial stimulant with almost every human being, which is
greatly increased by the cares and perplexities of life, and
therefore is more apparent as age advances. This desire should be
satisfied by the milder and least injurious drinks, as beer,
light wines, etc.' </p>

<p>Another states: 'I think opium and its preparation are used to
a considerable extent as stimulants, and am inclined to the
opinion that such use is increasing and that such increase is
due, in some degree, to the excitements, suffering and mental
disquietude resulting from the late war! </p>

<p>Boston-Among 20 or 30 druggists consulted there was a
diversity of opinions many of them not selling opium without a
physician's order. The following statements are among the most
important: </p>

<p>'Believes the habit of opium eating diminishing, as he has
fewer calls than formerly! </p>

<p>'Has one customer who buys half an ounce at a time. The number
of calls is less than formerly. Has observed that veteran
soldiers who contracted the habit in army hospitals are still
addicted to opium.' </p>

<p>'In the experience of twenty-five years has observed no
decided increase in the habit of opium eating. Recognizes the
correlation in the abuse of opium and of alcohol. The opium habit
frequently begins in the use of opium medicinally. Veteran
soldiers, as a class, are addicted to it . . . ' </p>

<p>'Thinks the abuse is not uncommon in the community but that it
is les,9 in Boston than elsewhere. Would look for it rather among
professional men threat among the poorer classes.' </p>

<p>'From his own experiences, believes that the habit of opium
eating has increased within the last five years from 50 to 75 per
cent. Never sells the drug without physician's prescription but
has on an average five or six daily applications for some one of
its preparations. It is largely taken by prostitutes.' 'Has but
one customer and that a noted temperance lecturer.' </p>

<p>S. F. McFarland-1877.7 </p>

<p>' McFarland, S. F.-Opium inebriety and the hypodermic syringe.
Trans. New York State Medical Society, 1877. </p>

<p>&quot;If cases of opium inebriety occur as frequently in the
private practice of other physicians as they have in my own, it
is coining to be a serious matter, and a few words of caution,
against the indiscriminate use of so active a drug, may be
pardonable. </p>

<p>&quot;Since the introduction of the hypodermic syringe,
especially, there has been a noticeable increase in the
frequency, as well as the severity, of these cases; and I wish to
enter a protest against its imprudent use, and particularly
against leaving it in the hands of patients or their friends, to
be used at their discretion, or even allowing them to know that
they can use it, except in the greatest emergencies; for once in
their possession, and used for any considerable length of time,
they will seldom discontinue it, and will soon be inquiring where
they can get 'one of those things'. It is certainly a most
valuable instrument in the hands of the discreet practitioner,
and will reach cases which nothing else will, with a certainty
and promptness which is very satisfactory; but it is too potent
for evil, as well, to be trusted beyond his grasp. </p>

<p>&quot;By the hypodermic use of opium the habit is much more
rapidly produced than by taking it into the stomach, or by any
other method-a fact which should not be lost sight of.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>0. Marshall-1878.8<br>
'Marshall, O. The opium habit in Michigan. Annual Report Michigan
State Board of Health. 1878. </p>

<p>Turning to a consideration of the early surveys, the one
already mentioned by 0. Marshall deserves first consideration, as
it was the earliest of which we have knowledge. While these
figures are obviously quite incomplete, they represent at least a
minimal extent and apparently can be depended upon as comprising
positive information as far as they go. For these reasons they
are of great importance to us today in seeking to arrive at a
true conception, first, of the probable influence of factors
other than illicit traffic and, second, of their possible
relationship to conditions of today. </p>

<p>Marshall begins his report with the following paragraph: </p>

<p>&quot;At a meeting of the State Board of Health in January,
1877, by a written communication, I called its attention to the
large number of opium-eaters in the vicinity of North Lansing,
giving many particulars relating to the opium habit as it exists
here. In complying with the request of the Board to prepare an
article for publication, I have extended the investigation to
other parts of the State, the result of which investigation is
here given.&quot; </p>

<p>From further observations the author realizes how impossible
it is to obtain complete and perfectly reliable information
concerning this condition. He states: </p>

<p>&quot;Those beat acquainted with its extent are the physician
and druggist. As a rule, the physician, although originally
responsible for many of the cases in his vicinity, is only aware
of them through his business relation with the druggist. The
latter, from whom the drug is obtained, from the fear of low of
trade, or, as some of them term it, a violation of confidential
business, are often unwilling to furnish any information with
regard to it.&quot; </p>

<p>Marshall sent two hundred circulars to prominent physicians
throughout the state asking for information in regard to the
opium &quot;habit&quot; in their localities and enclosing a
postal card with printed form for report of the number of men and
women using opium and morphin in each place. Marshall took care
to eliminate duplication of cases by addressing only one
physician in each locality and where reports from a physician
included figures from two or more druggists the lists were
compared and repeaters eliminated. To those, ninety-six replies
were received giving the number of morphin and opium users in
ninety-six cities, villages, and townships of the state. He says
in this connection: </p>

<p>&quot;From the supposed impossibility of getting reliable
information of the numbers in the larger cities, no circulars
were sent to Detroit, Grand Rapids or East Saginaw; and probably
from this cause no answers were received from many of the larger
cities of the State where circulars were sent.&quot; </p>

<p>The majority of the reports received by him include only those
persons with whom the physician personally was acquainted. This,
he points out, resulted in obtaining less complete information
than had the druggists themselves been addressed. This, he says,
is noticeable in the reports from two neighboring cities, one of
which gives the large number of one hundred sixteen, which number
was obtained after considerable effort by particular request,
while the other reports only one case. A druggist, however,
formerly in business in the latter city estimated the number of
opium users in that city at not less than sixty. From such facts
as these Marshall comes to the conclusion that only the minimal
number was obtained and that the actual number was probably
greater in many instances.<br>
<br>
We are including the complete table given in Marshall's report.
It is of peculiar interest because of the fact that urban, rural
and semirural communities were included and that the larger
cities of the state, in which the underworld and vicious element
naturally would be supposed to exist in the greatest degree, were
absent. The assumption therefore is that, whatever the cause for
the original use of the drug, the influence of vicious
association was relatively negligible. It is significant that
throughout his whole report no mention is made of illicit traffic
or of any source of supply other than that through physician and
druggist. </p>

<p>Marshall summarizes his findings as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;The total number of opium caters reported in the places
given is 1313; of these 803 are females, and 510 are males ...
The population of the cities and villages including the townships
in which they are situated, according to the State census of
1874, was 225,633. The population of the whole State at the same
time was 1,334,031. If the number of opium eaters, including
morphine eaters, in proportion to the population in the places
given holds good for the entire State, the total number of opium
caters, all classes, in the State would be 7,763. Taking every
degree of the habit into consideration, this estimate of the
number is probably not too large.&quot; </p>

<p>The smallest community from which figures were obtained had a
population of but 315, the largest a population of 10,235, the
average population of the 96 towns being 2350. In other words,
whatever the prevalence of the use of narcotic drugs obtained by
Marshall was, his facts were derived from small hamlets and towns
which scarcely could be dignified by the name of city even in the
time in which he wrote. These communities covered every section
of the state and presumably gave a true picture of it as a whole.
Obviously, as alreadk stated, underworld influences such as
prostitution, gambling, etc., largely can be eliminated. At the
time of this investigation communication was much more difficult
and less rapid than it is today; news was not so widely
disseminated and in an area of such an extent as that of the
state of Michigan, one must conclude that a situation of this
nature was caused by factors of common occurrence, by influences
shared alike by all communities rather than by artificial or
unusual influences operating in selected localities. If,
therefore, we find that Marshall's figures were based on
representative conditions common to all sections of the state, it
is reasonable to assume that they may be applied also to the
country as a whole. We may not assume, for instance, that the
distribution of painful disease, of insomnia, of nervousness, or
even of certain social proclivities and curiosity was peculiar to
Michigan and that in 1877 through some mischance its people, more
than those of other states, were subjected to pernicious
influences of this nature. Nor may we assume that the practice of
medicine was conducted along widely different lines in Michigan
from those elsewhere or that the druggists of Michigan were more
careless in the conduct of their business, less prone to make a
profitable sale or more blind to the harm resulting from this
traffic than those of other states. In other words, there would
seem no valid reason for not applying to the country as a whole
such figures as Marshall gives us in depicting the extent of
chronic opium intoxication in his state. Also the resulting
estimate for the country would be a minimal figure not only
because of the incompleteness of Marshall's returns but also
because of the absence in Michigan of certain influences which
would tend to increase the use of opium. At that time, as we know
from other sources, there were operating on both the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts influences that did not operate in Michigan, an
inland state. On the west coast there were such influences as the
maritime traffic with the Orient and the coolie labor imported
for railroad and other construction undertakings, while in New
England we have already seen poppy culture already was being
indulged in and shipments were being made to other states.<br>

<p>As a<b> </b>preliminary to the application of Marshall's
figures to the State of Michigan as a<b> </b>whole, three things
must be borne in mind-first, the total omission of returns from
the larger cities, second, the fact which he himself brings out,
that information secured from the stated source, namely,
physicians, was less complete than would have been information
secured from druggists, and, third, the use by Marshall of
population figures for the year 1874 instead of 1877. </p>

<p>From the ninety-six communities heard from, as we have seen,
there were reported 1313 users of opium or morphin. For some
unknown reason Marshall employs in his computation the state
census figures of 1874 rather than an estimated figure for the
year 1877 in which the survey was made. The population of
Michigan, according to him, was in 1874, 1,334,031. Employing
this figure he comes to the conclusion that if the number of
opium and morphin users holds good for the entire state the total
number in the state would be 7,763. Taking into account the
natural rate of increase in population between the years 1874 and
1877, this figure would represent a slight overestimate, all
other things being equal. However, this is offset by other
factors such as the relative incompleteness of the information
received from physicians as compared with that received from
druggists and it is fair to assume that this is a<b> </b>minimal
figure. How great the error on the side of underestimation is, we
have no means of telling. </p>

<p>The fact that in one town, Monroe, the physician addressed
reported but one case while <b>a </b>druggist stated that there
were about sixty, is indicative possibly of a very great error in
Marshall's total figure and it must be remembered that the
druggists were in a much better position to know the truth than
were physicians. They supplied the drugs used and as a rule,
especially at the time of Marshall's investigation when counter
sales were legal and a matter of common practice, physicians were
called upon only by those opiate users seeking curative treatment
for their condition. It is, therefore, doubtful if the medical
profession at any time has been in a position to supply anything
like a complete list of these cases while the druggists from the
very nature of things in the past could have furnished this
information. </p>

<p>It is probable, therefore, that Marshall's figures are very
much more incomplete than even he himself believed and it is
quite possible that the actual number of cases in the towns and
cities of Michigan from which Marshall received his returns were
several times larger than his figures indicated. Be this as it
may, his total of 1313 cases represents definite and positive
information indicative of the widespread use of these drugs in
the State of Michigan over fifty years ago, long before the
development of an illicit traffic in opium and its preparations
with its resulting artificial impetus to the formation of new
cases. If applied to the country as a whole for the year in
question, 1874, this figure gives a total of 251,936. This is a
startling figure for the period in question and yet in all
probability well below the actual one and deserving of the most
careful consideration on the part of those who today, with the
undoubted existence of new and increasingly powerful factors at
work in the stimulation of the use of these drugs, seek to become
familiar with the extent of our present narcotic problem. </p>

<p>Further on in his report, Marshall introduces the importation
figures from 1850 to 1877. From these he estimates an average
importation figure for the year 1877. From information secured
from drug store sales he comes to the conclusion that the average
user consumes about three pounds of opium during the year.
Allowing one-fifth of the total importation for &quot;legitimate
therapeutic use&quot; and dividing the remainder by three he
arrives at a figure of 93,654 as the number of users in the
country as a whole. From this figure by suitable calculation he
obtains for the State of Michigan about 25.50 users. </p>

<p>Elsewhere we have pointed out some of the dangers of
calculating the number of users upon such a basis as this and in
Marshall's effort we have a good illustration of the fallacies
that enter. If we take Marshall's figure of 2550 for the State of
Michigan we obtain, as the proportion of the ninety-six towns and
cities from which lie received definite information as to the
number of opium users, the figure of 421 or but one-third of the
actual number of users positively known to exist in these
ninety-six communities. It is quite evident that in (Calculations
based on importation figures there enter very large errors which
it is impossible to determine or correct. It seems, therefore, we
repeat, that little or no dependence can be placed on estimates
arrived at in this manner and that fragmentary as have been the
various actual surveys they furnish data of far greater value for
purposes of generalization. </p>

<p>C. W. Earle-1880.9 </p>

<p>'Earle, C. W.-Tile opium habit. Chicago Med. Rev. 1880. </p>

<p>Earle made a study of the extent of the use of opium in
Chicago by interviewing a number of druggists in that city.
Although the figure of the number of users he obtained may not be
used in a statistical analysis, his work is a distinct
contribution as an indication of the prevalence of the use of the
drug at the time. The following is a quotation from his report: </p>

<p>&quot;In an article entitled 'The Impending Danger,' Dr.
Mattison, of Brooklyn, states that he is assured by both dealers
in the crude drug and manufacturers of the alkaloids, that
importation of opium is increasing rapidly every year, and that
the supply may become insufficient for the demand. The question
naturally suggesting itself is: What becomes of the vast amount
yearly brought to our shores?&quot; </p>

<p>Earle investigated fifty drug stores, asking questions as to
the number of customers, their age, nativity, kind of narcotic
used, quantity, etc. He reports: </p>

<p>&quot;The three divisions of the city were visited, and
localities inhabited by the different classes and nationalities
were thoroughly canvassed. I was greatly surprised to find that
druggists on the West Side were patronized to a greater extent
(excepting a few on Clark Street) than in any other part of the
city. Foreign druggists (German and Scandinavian), seem to
exhibit more conscientious scruples in regard to the trade than
our own nationality. I learned from some of these gentlemen that
in Denmark, and, if I mistake not, in Norway and Sweden, the
trade is absolutely forbidden. Fifty druggists have 235
customers, or an average of nearly five to each store.&quot; </p>

<p>J. M. Hull-1885. </p>

<p>An account of Hull's findings appears in the Biennial Report
of the State Board of Health of Iowa for 1985. This Biennial
Report covers a period of two years ending June 30, 1885, and it
is not quite clear from his article whether the investigation was
made in the latter half of 1883, during 1884 or in the first half
of 1885. In using his figures, therefore, we shall choose the
middle period and base our computations on the population figures
of 1884. </p>

<p>Hull begins his report with the following: </p>

<p>&quot;Although my paper on the opium habit is brief, and but a
small part of the sad story told, yet I am inclined to believe it
contains some facts regarding this rapidly increasing evil that
cannot fail to astonish even those who are well informed, and far
more those who have given the subject little or no attention. </p>

<p>&quot;Opium is today a greater curse than alcohol, and justly
claims a large number of helpless victims, which have not come
from the ranks of reckless men and fallen women, but the majority
of them are to be found among the educated and most honored and
useful members of society; and as to sex, we may count out the
prostitutes so much given to this vice, and still find females
far ahead so far as numbers are concerned. The habit in a vast
majority of cases is first formed by the unpardonable
carelessness of physicians, who are often too fond of using a
little syringe, or of relieving every ache and pain by the
administration of an opiate.&quot; </p>

<p>To fifteen hundred circulars sent to druggists in the state of
Iowa, requesting information on the subject, Hull received 123
replies reporting 235 users of opium in some form. Of these 86
were men and 129 women.10 The form of drug used was morphin, 129;
gum opium, 73; laudanum, 12; paregoric, 6; Dover's Powder, 3;
McMunn's Elixir, 4. As to the method of using the drug he states:
</p>

<p>&quot;While the drug is used less frequently by the hypodermic
method than by the mouth, the former method is gaining ground.
The habit may be formed about as readily one way as the other.
Those who use it by the mouth as a rule make the most rapid
progress, as the drug is easier taken, is free from pain, and
larger than the hypodermic dose.&quot; </p>

<p>He states that there were about 3,000 stores in Iowa where
opium was kept for sale and that if reports had come from all in
the same ratio it would have shown the number of users to have
been about 6,000. By actual computation on the above basis we get
5,732. Hull states, however, that his reports were mostly from
the small villages, very few coming from the cities where, he
states, the &quot;habit&quot; was far more common. He states
further: </p>

<p>&quot;From reliable information which I have been able to
secure from various sources, I feel safe in saying that there are
in this state over 10,000 people who are constantly under the
influence of an opiate and who are wholly unable by any effort of
the will to break the habit or even to abstain for 72
hours.&quot; </p>

<p>The estimated population of continental United States for 1884
was according to the U. S. Bureau of the Census 55,379,154 and
that of the State of Iowa for the same year was 1,742,084. </p>

<p>Using the lower figure of 5,732 obtained in the manner
described above, as<b> </b>the actual number of users in the
State of Iowa, we get 182,215<b> </b>chronic users for the
country as a whole for the year 1884. This must be by far an
underestimate as Hull himself states that he had good reason to
believe that there were over 10,000 in the state. </p>

<p>In considering estimates based on Hull's figure several points
should be borne in mind. First, Hull does not indicate the
population served by the 123<b> </b>stores reporting the 235
cases. Although he does state that there were about 3,000 stores
in Iowa where opium was kept, in assuming that the sales averaged
the same in different stores, there is the possibility of error.
Second, according to Hull's own statement most of the cases
reported were from small villages with very few coming from the
cities, where he states the &quot;habit&quot; was far more
common. With the usual vicious elements of city life eliminated,
one may assume that Hull's figures represent a minimal extent. </p>

<p>It is worthy of note that here again no mention is made of
illicit traffic. </p>

<p>B. H. Hartwell-1888.11 </p>

<p>' Hartwell, B. H. The sale and Use of Opium in Massachusetts.
Annual Report, Massachusetts State Board of Health, 1889.<br>
Hartwell made a<b> </b>survey in the State of Massachusetts, in
the report of which, unfortunately, he failed to give the
population figures on which the study was based. If these figures
were available it might be possible to compute the per capita
consumption. Although this cannot be done, we are giving below a
summary of that part of his survey dealing with extent as an
interesting side-light on conditions obtaining in that period. </p>

<p>Hartwell states that the investigation was undertaken in
accordance with the following &quot;resolve&quot; adopted by the
Legislature of 1888: </p>

<p>&quot;Resolved, That the State Board of Health be requested to
make an investigation concerning the sale and use of opium, in
various forms and preparations, with a view to ascertaining the
extent of the evils arising therefrom; whether such use and evils
are increasing, and, if so, the manner and cause thereof, and
what remedies for such evils may be proposed; and to report the
result of such investigation to the General Court.&quot; </p>

<p>Hartwell continues his report as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;This resolution was presumably an outcome of the
prevalent belief that the use of opium is increasing very
rapidly. An expos6 of the opium joints in Boston appeared in one
of the leading dailies in 1885; there have been frequent
allusions to the habit in other papers; a recent article,
claiming to be the result of years of study of the opium habit in
Boston, was published in one of our popular magazines, in which
the writer says that the habit 'is increasing rapidly! In these
and numerous other ways the public has been taught to believe
that the evil is widespread and extending. The large number of
opium habitues which seem to be among us, the novelty of this
form of stimulation, its secret character, the strong hold which
it has upon its victims, the horrible results arising therefrom,
especially from the habit of opium smoking,-all tend to keep the
subject prominently before the people, and to magnify the evil in
the public mind. To get at the facts concerning the use of opium
(the term opium will include all of its preparations), as far as
possible, is the object aimed at in this inquiry. This is beset
with many difficulties, from the very nature of things. There can
be no reliable statistics of the amount of opium used by the
medical profession, the laity, or by habitues, or the proportion
used by each. The most rigid inquiry into a habit as secret and
as easily practised as is this form of inebriety could not be
sufficiently accurate for mathematical calculation; approximation
only can be attained. </p>

<p>&quot;That a great deal of opium is used besides that
legitimately required for the relief of pain and treatment of
disease, is unquestionably true. The unwillingness of people to
bear pain, the habit of self-prescribing, the many facilities for
obtaining opium and its preparations from the regular dealers as
well as by means of proprietary medicines containing it, the
numerous ways by which a knowledge is gained of the method of
obtaining and taking the drug-all extend its use in the most
dangerous manner. </p>

<p>&quot;As the best means for forming an opinion of the amount
of opium used, and whether or not its use is increasing,
circulars were sent to many of the druggists and physicians of
the State; the questions asked and a synopsis of the answers
returned are given below. Some allowance must be made in
considering the returns, for the reason that opium habitues, from
fear of detection or a desire for secrecy, scatter their
purchases as much as possible; so that a druggist may easily get
an impression of an increased or decreased use of the drug, while
in reality the sales are going on elsewhere or have returned
after the rounds have been completed. So also the same habitual
users might be seen by different physicians, and counted several
times, or escape notice altogether, and thus convey a false idea
of the actual number. A circular containing five questions was
sent to druggists. Replies were received from about 600
druggists, representing 190 cities and towns, and embracing
nearly every city and town in the State where a druggist is
located. (There are about 150 towns in which no druggists
reside.) About one-fourth of the answers came from Boston, the
rest from other parts of that State. Many of the returned
circulars contained answers to all of the questions, others to
only part of them; hence the number varies in the different
questions. The questions and answers were as follows:- </p>

<p>&quot;I. What amounts of opium are sold by you per month, not
on the advice and prescription of a physician?&quot; </p>

<p>The answers numbering 512 to 541 showed the following: </p>

<p>(a) Crude opium, opium in pill or other solid form? </p>

<p>Sixty per cent. none-the remainder a few pills to 4 pounds. </p>

<p>(b) Liquid preparations; Tincture? </p>

<p>Twelve per cent. none; the remainder one gram to 32 pints;
other liquid preparations none to 40 pints. </p>

<p>(c) Morphia and its salts, in bulk, pill or powder? </p>

<p>Thirty-three per cent. none; the remainder % gr. to 8 oz.
morphia 2 to 500 morphia pills, mostly 1/8 grs. </p>

<p>(d) Other preparations very little. </p>

<p>&quot;2. Is the demand for opium and its salts increasing? 535
answers: 85 per cent., no; 8 per cent., yes; 5 per cent.,
decreasing; 2 per cent., do not know.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;For obvious reasons, circulars were also sent to many of
the physicians of the State who commenced practice before 1875.
About 260 replies were received, from 100 cities and towns out of
about 250 in which physicians reside. Eight questions were
submitted, which with the number and character of the answers,
were as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;1. From your own observation, is the use of opium and
its preparations increasing in the community in which you live?
225 answers: 66 per cent., no; 28 per cent., yes; 6 per cent., do
not know. </p>

<p>&quot;2. If such be the case, what is the probable cause of
such increase; this question called for answers only from those
who had answered the first question affirmatively; consequently,
but 75 of a miscellaneous character were received. Twenty per
cent., give the use of opium by physicians as the sole cause; 11
per cent., give this as the cause in part. Ease of obtaining
opium from druggists, duplication of prescriptions containing
opium, increased knowledge of its effects, excessive brain work,
desire for stimulation, fast living, comprise most of the
remaining answers. </p>

<p>&quot;3. Are diseases calling for the use of opium increasing?
209 answers: 84 per cent., no; 16 per cent., yes.&quot; </p>

<p>Although he believes, as can be seen from the above, that a
great deal of opium &quot;is used besides that legitimately
required for the relief of pain and the treatment of
disease,&quot; on the basis of his study, Hartwell concludes that
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot; </font>. . . the use of opium is not
increasing in Massachusetts. In the large centres of population
there may be a slight increase from year to year. It is here that
excesses and crime of all kinds, if not increasing, are much more
common than in less populous districts. The better knowledge of
the uses and effects of the drug, by means of the greater
intercommunication of the people; the many facilities for
obtaining it; the general practice of writing prescriptions,
followed by unrestrained reduplication of them; the excitement of
business, leading to overwork and overtaxing of the mental
powers,-are conditions which are favorable to the increased use
of opium.&quot; </p>

<p>A. P. Ginnell-1900.12 </p>

<p>'Grinnell, A. P.-A review of drug consumption and alcohol as
found in proprietary medicine. Med. Leg. Jour., 1905.<br>
This author made a study of the consumption of drugs in the State
of Vermont and while he made no attempt to estimate the number of
opium users from it, a report of his study is interesting as an
indication of the use in Vermont at that time. There appears to
be no reason to believe that this report covers a community
influenced by any unusual factors but rather it represents a
normal distribution of drug users. </p>

<p>The author states: </p>

<p>&quot;Few people are aware of the enormous consumption of
narcotics or stimulating drugs. With the development of
pharmaceutical science and the consequent improvement and
facility in preparing drugs and alkaloids the market has grown
accordingly. More widespread knowledge concerning the effects and
special uses of opium, cocaine, quinine, Cannabis Indica, Chloral
and Heroin, ha's further stimulated the demand for these drugs,
until today the American people are confronted by a problem which
is only equaled in its magnitude by its terrible and appalling
aspects. </p>

<p>&quot;When we pause to consider the fearful inroads the
excessive and habitual use of these drugs make on the mentality,
physical health and general existence of those addicted to them,
we can easily appreciate what a serious menace to society a rapid
increase of drug habitues must inevitably mean. </p>

<p>&quot;It is hardly necessary to speak of the results of the
habitual and excessive use of narcotic drugs. Physicians, more
than any other class, realize the fearful ravages made on the
human system; and the large number of physical, moral and mental
wrecks they are constantly meeting who owe their condition
entirely to drug addiction, tells eloquently how extensive and
far-reaching the drug evil has become. Every alienist is daily
being brought face to face with the growing influence of certain
drugs on psychic abnormalities and degenerations, and the
insidious onset and progress of such conditions, when so
produced, cannot fail to impress us with the Medico-Legal
importance of the drug habit.&quot; </p>

<p>In order to secure information as to the consumption of
certain drugs, Grinnell wrote the druggists of the State asking
them for estimates of their monthly sales of the following drugs
and preparations: </p>

<p>&quot;Opium (gum or powder) </p>

<p>Morphine sulp. (powder or pills) </p>

<p>Dover powder </p>

<p>Paregoric (tinct. opii. camph.) </p>

<p>Laudanuin (tinct. opii) </p>

<p>Cocaine </p>

<p>Chloral </p>

<p>Indian hemp (Cannabis Indica) </p>

<p>Quinine (powder or pills)?&quot; </p>

<p>Of 130 druggists addressed 116 were heard from. He also
addressed 172 general stores which sold drugs in localities where
no drug stores existed and three wholesale druggists, but
obtained no satisfactory information from the latter. </p>

<p>He states that ninety per cent. of the physicians of Vermont
dispense their own drugs and that sales of these drugs to
physicians were not included in the figures supplied by
druggists. </p>

<p>He also states that the figures he secured could be multiplied
by five and be below the actual consumption inasmuch as they
include &quot;nothing in the composition of patent medicines or
cough medicines; nothing dispensed by physicians; nothing
dispensed by these three large manufactories-simply the regular
retail drug store businesses and the sales of the 160 general
stores.&quot; </p>

<p>From these two sources lie estimated 3,300,000 doses of opium
were sold every month-enough to supply &quot;one and one-half
doses of opium to every man and woman in the State of Vermont
above the age of 21 years, every day in the year.&quot; </p>

<p>The actual amounts sold by druggists as compiled by Grinnell
were as follows: </p>

<p>The above figures cover reports from 69 out of 344 towns, and
from 116 drug stores out of 130, but do not include amounts sold
in the general stores. </p>

</p>

<p>A committee of this organization, H. F. Hynson, Chairman,
reported on the replies received from pharmacists and physicians
in certain localities in response to queries sent by the
committee. The conclusion arrived at was to the effect that at
least five users of certain drugs, commonly known as
&quot;habit-forming&quot; but not opium alone, were known to
every pharmacist. From this it was estimated that there were at
least 200,000 in the country. </p>

<p>'Hynson, H. P.-Report of Committee on Acquirement of the Drug
Habit. Amer. Jour. Pharm. November, 1902. </p>

<p>In the following year the same Committee with E. G. Eberle as
chairman made a more extensive canvass of the situation through
letters to all sections of the United States and Canada. As a
result of the information so gathered, which dealt with cocaine
and other drugs as well as opium preparations, the Committee came
to certain conclusions, the most suggestive of which follow: </p>

<p>Eberle, E. G. Report of Committee on Acquirement of Drug
Habits. Amer. Jour. Pharm. October, 1903. </p>

<p>&quot;General reports indicate that the sale of narcotics is
not restricted to any section of the country, nor confined
exclusively to the fallen and lower class. Information comes from
several sources that in callings which demand many hours' work at
a time or the hours of night, cocaine is resorted to for
stimulation.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We are confident that the use of narcotics is increasing
and that evil effects from it will come to succeeding
generations. While the increase is most evident with the lower
classes, the statistics of institutes devoted to the cure of
habitues show that their patients are principally drawn from
those in the higher walks of life.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Careful study of data personally collected and from
reliable sources forces the conclusion that the habitual use of
opium in its various forms is increasing and that this increase
is confined to no one class or occupation.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;While it has not been practicable to obtain exact
figures, it can be stated that the drug habit is alarmingly
increasing among the men of our army and navy. The number of men
using opium in the army has greatly increased since the
occupation of the Philippines, many 'opium smokers' acquiring the
habit there from Chinese or natives. The smoking of opium by the
men of the navy does not seem to be as prevalent as in the army,
gum opium 'pills' or morphine being the way in which the drug is
mostly used by sailors. Quite a number of enlisted men have been
discharged from both army and navy during the last year because
of their being detected as habitual users of opium or
morphine-probably several hundred per cent. more during the last
five years than for any ten years previous. To the best of the
writers knowledge-and he has carefully inquired into facts
-practically all the cases of drug habitues in both army and navy
arise from the men learning the habit from natives of foreign
countries or from lewd women and men in this country. Not a
single case of drug habit coming from the prescribing of an
opiate by a medical officer can be recalled, opium and allied
drugs being very guardedly and carefully used by army and navy
medical officers. A goodly percentage of the cases are men who
have acquired some drug habit prior to enlistment while a few-sad
to say-are from men of the hospital corps who drifted into the
habit from constant opportunity and handling of the baneful drug.
</p>

<p>&quot;At the present, it is calculated that there are over a
million opium smokers in the United States, the importation of
opium for smoking purposes being double that for medicinal uses,
amounting to more than 500,000 pounds last year, valued at
$3,000,000 1 &quot; </p>

<p>1 -C. E. Terry-1913.15<br>
'Terry, C. E.-Annual Report Board of Health, Jacksonville, Fla.,
1013, </p>

<p>In 1913 Terry, Health Officer of Jacksonville, Florida,
collected data relating to the extent of the problem in his city.
The figures were not dependent upon voluntary cooperation as in
the case of previous collections of such material, but were
secured through the operation of a local law which required,
besides the usual prohibition of sale of opium preparations by
druggists without physicians' prescriptions and the keeping of
records of all sales, two procedures which resulted in bringing
to the health office specific information relating to the extent
to which opium preparations were employed. The first of these
required physicians writing prescriptions containing more than
three grains of morphin or its equivalent in alkaloids or salts
of alkaloids of opium to send to the office of the health
department copies of such prescriptions together with the names
and addresses of the individuals for whom they were intended.
Second, it provided that the city health officer or other
physician in the employ of the city designated by him might give
to any user, upon the furnishing of satisfactory evidence of
habitual use, a prescription for as much of such drug as might be
deemed expedient. </p>

<p>Records were kept of all duplicate prescriptions sent in and
of all those issued at the health office. These prescriptions
were free and were designed to remove from druggists the
temptation of making counter sales on the plea that indigent
users or those of small means could not afford to pay for the
writing of a prescription in addition to the cost of the drug.
The law was enforced actively and both druggists and physicians
were watched carefully for violations. </p>

<p>No effort was made at this time to limit the use of these
drugs in the case of habitual users nor were they subjected to
such treatment as might be calculated to discourage them from
coming to the health department for a prescription. On the
contrary, during the operation of this law-a period of over two
years-they were supplied upon application. Treatment was offered
them from time to time and furnished to such as accepted the
offer. </p>

<p>Through the operation of this law there were recorded at the
health office during the year 1913, 541 persons using opium or
some preparation thereof or about .81 per cent. of the population
of Jacksonville. These were divided into 228 men and 313 women.
Of the men 188 were white and 40 colored; of the women 219 white
and 94 colored. The population of Jacksonville for 1913 as
estimated by the U. S. Bureau of the Census was 67,209. Of this
number 32,998 were whites and 34,211 colored. Applied to
continental United States on the basis of the estimated
population for 1913 of 97,163,330, the Jacksonville incidence
gives as the total for the country 782,118. </p>

<p>In interpreting these figures, however, it should be borne in
mind that while the percentage of whites using opium in
Jacksonville is much greater than that of blacks, the black
population in Jacksonville is very high compared to that of the
country as a whole. If, as is indicated by the Jacksonville
figures, the white race is more prone to use opium than the
negro, suitable correction will be necessary in generalizing from
the Jacksonville figures. As will be seen later, this same
predilection of the whites appears in Brown's figures of the
Tennessee studies. These two studies, however, are not sufficient
in our judgment to assume the establishment of such racial
tendencies as many other factors quite possibly may have
influenced these findings. </p>

<p>If, however, such racial tendencies as the Jacksonville and
Tennessee findings seem to indicate do exist, then in computing
the distribution of opium use in the country as a whole it will
be necessary to correct for the different race distribution
existing in Jacksonville as compared with continental United
States by applying the figures obtained in Jacksonville to the
white and black populations separately. </p>

<p>In 1913, the white population of continental United States was
86,580,278 and colored 10,583,052. Applying the Jacksonville
figures to the country as a whole, therefore, we get 1,109,340
total opium using population. This naturally is a larger figure
than the original crude figure of 782,118. </p>

<p>One source of possible error in figures of this kind exists in
the increase which may take place over the normal population of
users through the registration of transients. In the case of
Jacksonville, however, it would not seem that this was a large
factor inasmuch as the registration required either through
application to the health office or through the sending of
duplicate prescriptions by physicians was not required in nearby
states and cities at that time so that it was more difficult for
strangers to obtain the drug in Jacksonville than in other nearby
points. Whatever this error was, however, it is very much more
than offset by the omissions in registration which occurred in
the following ways. It was known to the health officer, for
instance, that certain business and professional men and other
individuals in high social standing who used the drug were never
registered but secured their supplies either by mail order from
distant points or through friendly physicians or druggists who
were willing to risk violating the law for them. Others through
the nature of their employment in drug stores or drug
manufacturing concerns were able easily to supply themselves,
while still others went to nearby points outside of the city
limits and hence beyond the operation of the ordinance to secure
their supply. </p>

<p>What part differences in race composition (other than negro),
economic, occupational and other sociologic factors may have
played in vitiating the Jacksonville figures for purposes of
generalization no one is in position to say at the present time,
as enough studies of the prevalence of this condition in other
sections of the country have not been made to justify claims
either for or against the existence of such influencing factors.
In view, however, of the facilities at hand for the collection of
the Jacksonville data, it is believed that they represent very
complete information. As in a consideration of Marshall's figures
for Michigan, it may be assumed that the distribution of painful
maladies and the methods of medical practice in Jacksonville did
not differ widely from those of other sections. In 1913, however,
the influence of prostitution and what is generally termed the
underworld obtained much more prominently in Jacksonville than in
the localities of Michigan with which Marshall's figures deal as
these were, it will be remembered, all small towns and villages.
In the case of the Jacksonville figures, therefore, we may assume
that the influence of vicious association was a more marked
factor than in the Michigan figures. </p>

<p>The illicit traffic in these drugs was practically negligible
in Jacksonville in 1913. One or two peddlers, it is true,
supplied certain women in the restricted district more as a
matter of convenience to these customers than because of any
large profits involved. The traffic could not have been lucrative
as free prescriptions were available to any user asking for them
and the price of the drug in the drug stores was in the
neighborhood of 60 cents for a drachra of morphin when sold in
original bottles or large fractions. With this price it is
evident that peddlers could not compete with profit. </p>

<p>Lucius P. Brown-1915.16 </p>

<p>' Brown, L. P.-Enforcement of the Tennessee Anti-Narcotic Law.
Amer. J. of Public Health, 1915, Vol. 5, No. 4. </p>

<p>Brown, the State Food and Drugs Commissioner of Tennessee,
reported on the results of the enforcement of the Tennessee
Anti-Narcotic Law passed in 1913. The law provided for the
refilling of prescriptions for persons using opium products
habitually &quot;in order to minimize suffering among this
unfortunate class, and to keep the traffic in the drug from
getting into underground and hidden channels.&quot; The law
provided that upon application to the Secretary of the State
Board of Health and the Pure Food and Drugs Inspector and upon
presentation of a certificate from the attending physician, the
name and address of the druggist and certain other data, an
individual might be granted permission to have a prescription for
an opium product refilled. This system brought a considerable
mass of data to the officials concerned. It should be noted in
explanation that an effort was made at every renewal of permit to
lessen the amount of the drug allowed. </p>

<p>After twelve months of operation there were on January 1,
1915, 2370 individuals registered under this system in the state
of Tennessee. Of these 784 were men and 1586 women. </p>

<p>In commenting on the accuracy of the registration Brown
states: </p>

<p>&quot;As to what proportion of the total addicts of Tennessee
are registered under this permissive system, guesses only can be
given. It seems safe to say that not over one-half of the addict
population is registered-possibly not over one fourth. Taking,
however, the lower figure, it would appear that there are in the
neighborhood of 5,000 addicts in Tennessee. The state has about
2.3 per cent. of the whole population of the United States. It is
an agricultural state, and consequently, living conditions appear
to be not so exhausting as in more thickly settled communities,
nor life as a rule, so intense. In order to get the whole number
in the United States, we may multiply our figure of 5,000 by 43.
This gives us about 215,000 addicts. Probably, however, in order
to allow for conditions in cities and, industrial communities, we
ought to add 25 per cent. to this number, giving not less than
269,000 addicts in the whole United States. In my opinion this is
a very conservative calculation. It shows by no means so many as
sensational writers appear to want us to believe, and while it
thus shows better conditions it is bad enough.&quot; </p>

<p>Brown points out that according to figures which he believes
to be fairly accurate not over ten per cent. of the cases were
colored. He says: </p>

<p>&quot;This is due in part to the fact that the average negro
avoids as far as possible any contact with an official, and to
the fact that the negro appears to use relatively less morphine,
and more cocaine than the white man.&quot; </p>

<p>This agrees with the race distribution in Jacksonville. If we
should take Brown's estimate of 5000 cases and distribute them
according to what he believes to be a race incidence actually
existing, namely 9070 white and 1070 negroes, we should reach a
different total for the country from that reached by Brown.
Making this correction and applying, on the basis of Brown's
estimate for Tennessee, the race incidence obtaining to the
country as a whole, we get 221,818 white users and 11,518 black
users or 233,336 as a total in the United States for 1913. If we
now add, as Brown suggests, 2517c &quot;in order to allow for
conditions in cities and industrial communities,&quot; we obtain
a total of 291,670 for the United States. Whether or not this
correction should be made has already been considered in our
discussion of the Jacksonville figures. We give it for what it is
worth with no claim that the race distribution of opium use in
these two localities typifies racial characteristics. </p>

<p>Such a generalization from the Tennessee figures indicates a
very much smaller total for the country than is obtained on the
basis of the Jacksonville figures, although these two
investigations were made within a year of each other. The
territory covered by the Tennessee law was very much larger than
in the case of Jacksonville and the machinery for enforcement
doubtless was less adequate. In Jacksonville, it must be
remembered, every physician and every druggist personally was
known to the health officer as were most of the opium users and
it is to be expected that on these accounts more complete
information could be secured than where, for the most part as in
the case of Tennessee, it was necessary to rely on correspondence
without the close personal touch possible in the smaller
territory. Brown himself questions the completeness of his
figures, stating that in his opinion they comprise a very
conservative estimate. </p>

<p>Which of these estimates is nearer the truth for the period in
question no one may state with certainty. It is noteworthy,
however, that Brown's figures applied to the country as a whole
give a figure but little in excess of that obtained on the basis
of the Michigan figures of 1877, about thirty-five years before
Brown's work. It scarcely is to be expected that with the
influences at work, which we shall note in the next chapter,
during this period of thirty-five years, there could have failed
to be a greater increase than is indicated by these two sets of
figures. </p>

<p>The estimates resulting from studies heretofore quoted
represent conditions of opium usage freer from artificial
influences of one kind or another than any that have been or will
be compiled dealing with later periods. Prior to this time there
was no federal law relating to the distribution of the drug and
but very few state laws which were at all rigidly enforced, so
that peddling of the drugs was not a marked factor in extending
their use. The usual causes mentioned, such as the employment of
opium and its products in medicine and self-prescribing for the
relief of pain and discomfort, the effect of education through
ill-considered articles in the lay press and magazines, fiction,
vicious or ignorant associations, and the influence of natural
tendencies to dissipation or to seek refuge under stress and
strain, were operating alone without the additional stimulation
of the illicit traffic which was a later development. Wherever,
therefore, the exact truth lies as to the number of chronic opium
users in the United States prior to the passage of the Harrison
Narcotic Act it represents what might be termed the normal for
the United States in contradistinction to an artificial or
fortuitous figure resulting in addition to the forementioned
causes from the perniciously active propaganda of the commercial
trader in opium preparations. </p>

<p>'The federal anti-narcotic law passed December 17, 1914. </p>

<p>Special Committee of Investigation appointed by the Secretary
of the Treasury-1918P </p>

<p>'Traffic in Narcotic Drugs--Report of Special Committee of
Investigation appointed March 25, 1918, by the Secretary of the
Treasury, June, 1919. Washington. 1919. </p>

<p>This Committee was unable to determine the exact number of
addicts in the United States, 'owing, as stated in the Report,
&quot;to the lack of laws and regulations making it compulsory
for the registration of addicts throughout the country or the
keeping of any records as to their identity.&quot; </p>

<p>The Committee believed, however, that a fairly accurate
estimate of their number can be made from the information which
it has obtained. </p>

<p>One source of information was a questionnaire addressed to all
physicians registered under the Harrison Narcotic Act, requesting
data as to the number of chronic users under treatment by them at
the time. The Committee reports as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;Replies were received from approximately 30 2/3 per cent
of the physicians registered in the different States, and these
showed that there were under treatment at that time a total of
73,150 addicts. On the basis of 100 per cent replies, if the same
average was maintained, there were under treatment at the time
this questionnaire was sent out a total of 237,655 addicts. The
following table&quot; shows in detail by States the number of
addicts reported under treatment, the percentage of replies
received from physicians, and the estimated number on the basis
of 100 per cent replies.&quot; </p>

<p>Another questionnaire was addressed to state, district, county
and municipal health officers, the results of which are given as
follows: </p>

<p>&quot;Questionnaire No. 4 was addressed to 3,023 State,
district, county and municipal health officers. To this
questionnaire 983 replies were received, or 33 per cent of the
total number sent out. Only 777 of these, or 26 per cent of the
total, contained any information of value to the committee.&quot;
</p>

<p>The Report summarizes as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;The number of addicts reported by the health officials
replying to questionnaire No. 4 was 105,887. As this number
represents the addicts reported by only 26 per cent of the health
officials, from which this information was requested, it may be
assumed that had all the health officials replied the total
number would have amounted to approximately 420,000. This number,
however, appears to be much too low, in view of the fact that the
physicians of the country are estimated to have had about 237,000
addicts under treatment during this same period, and only a small
portion of the total number of addicts present themselves for
treatment. Addicts of the &quot;underworld,&quot; for instance,
secure most of their supply through illicit channels and rarely,
if ever, consult a physician. </p>

<p><img src="op100005.gif" align="bottom" width="495"
height="681"> </p>

<p>&quot;It appears that a more accurate estimate of the total
number of addicts may be obtained from the data secured by those
investigators who have made an intensive study of drug addiction
in certain restricted communities. For example, the health
officer of Jacksonville, Fla., reported 887 1 addicts in that
city in 1913. This number represents 1.31 per cent of the
population. Upon this basis the total number of addicts in the
United States, in 1918, taking the estimated population as
106,000,000 would be 1,388,600. </p>

<p>&quot;In reply to questionnaire No. 4 sent to health officers
of States, counties, and municipalities, the health officer of
New York City reported a total of 103,000 addicts, which is
equivalent to 1.8 per cent of the population. On this basis,
there would be 1,9W,000 addicts in the United States. </p>

<p>&quot;Information in the hands of the committee indicates that
drug addiction is less prevalent in rural communities than in
cities or in congested centers. It would, therefore, be unfair to
estimate the number of addicts in the entire country on the basis
of the figures obtained for New York City. Furthermore, it is the
opinion of the committee that an estimate based on the number of
addicts in a small city like Jacksonville, Fla., would not be
representative for the entire country. Taking these facts into
consideration, the committee is of the opinion that the total
number of addicts in this country probably exceeds 1,000,000 at
the present time.&quot; </p>

<p>' This figure includes 346 cocaine users. </p>

<p>In reviewing the estimates arrived at on the basis of the
replies received to these questionnaires, there arises a question
as to what is meant by &quot;treatment.&quot; From a later
statement in the Report &quot;treatment&quot; here means
presumably the supplying of the drug by physicians, but we
believe that in replying to this question the average physician
would report only such cases as were under curative treatment. Be
this as it may, the propriety of estimating the number of cases
on the basis of 100% replies from physicians registered under the
Harrison Narcotic Act is open to question. It is stated in the
Report that thirty and two-thirds per cent. of the registered
physicians queried replied and that 73,150 cases were reported by
them as being under treatment. To assume that the resulting
figure of 237,655 calculated on -such a basis is a correct
estimate, is still not warranted. For such an estimate to be
accepted as a logical conclusion on the basis of 100% replies 'it
would have to be assumed that all groups of physicians registered
under the Harrison Narcotic Law answered in like proportion. But
it is natural to assume that nose and throat specialists,
oculists, obstetricians, gynecologists, surgeons and others not
occupied with general practice would not be interested to the
same degree in replying to the questionnaire. In all probability
the thirty and two-thirds per cent. physicians reporting include
a relatively greater proportion of those treating addiction cases
than those not reporting. Under these conditions the estimated
237,655 addicts is too high a figure. As a matter of fact,
however, the Committee appears not to accept this figure, anyway,
inasmuch as it ultimately reaches a speculative figure of
1,000,000, inclusive of cocaine users. </p>

<p>As to the estimates based on replies received from state,
county and municipal health officers of which the Committee
states only twenty six per cent. replied, we would call attention
to the fact that 103,000 were reported by the health commissioner
of New York City, with a balance of the twenty-six per cent.
reporting only 2887. This material was gathered in 1918. At that
time also nothing in the nature of a survey of chronic opium
users in New York City had been made. The narcotic clinic was not
opened until 1919 and this clinic disclosed but 7464 cases of
opium users. It is manifest therefore that the 103,000 reported
by the health commissioner in the previous year was wholly
speculative. It is also of interest to note that the health
commissioner of New York City a year or two later stated that
20,000 was an outside estimate for cases of chronic opium users
in New York City. </p>

<p>Here again, however, the Committee admits dissatisfaction with
the resulting estimate of 420,000, stating that the figure is too
low and ultimately arrives at an approximate figure of 1,000,000
including users of cocain. It is not apparent in the Report how
this figure is reached. </p>

<p>New York City Health Department Narcotic Clinic-April, 1919,
to January, 1920. </p>

<p>'Hubbard, S. D@The New York City Narcotic Clinic and differing
points of view on narcotic addiction. Monthly Bulletin, Dept. of
Health, City of New York, February 1920. </p>

<p>Hubbard 21 reports on the findings resulting from the data
gathered during the operation of this clinic over a period of
approximately nine months. This clinic was conducted in
co-operation with the New York State Department of Narcotic Drug
Control. In regard to the extent of opium usage in New York City,
Hubbard states: </p>

<p>&quot;The problem of narcotic addiction has been in the public
eye for some time, and the differing points of view regarding
narcotic addiction have been provocative of some very interesting
discussion. </p>

<p>&quot;In the Spring of last year, the Federal authorities
having made several raids on trafficking physicians and
druggists, an acute emergency was created whereby it was feared
by some that a panic of these miserable unfortunates would ensue.
These conditions caused the New York City Department of Health to
open a narcotic relief clinic in order to study and examine into
the subject of narcotic drug addiction. </p>

<p>Number of Drug Addicts in New York City </p>

<p>&quot;Many opinions regarding the prevalence and frequency of
drug addiction have been expressed. No doubt many of these
statements are far from true. We do not know who the addicts are,
nor how many there are of them, either here or elsewhere in this
country. Why? From opinions expressed, and from the literature on
this subject, we have been led to believe that addiction was
allocated with certain definite physical stigmata; pallor,
emaciation, nervousness, apprehension, sniffing, needle puncture
markings, and tattoo skin evidences; but in actual experience
with hundreds of acknowledged drug addicts, persons actually
seeking their drug supply, we find, like the weather indications,
all such signs failing. </p>

<p>&quot;There are drug addicts constitutionally inferior, and
superior; feeble-minded, and strong-minded; physically below, and
above par; morally inferior, and superior. No one class of
society seems, in our experience, to enjoy a monopoly in this
practice. Our opinions, therefore regarding the number of drug
addicts, here and elsewhere about this country, have very
naturally had to be revised. While it was the current opinion to
think that they existed in vast numbers estimated by some as one
per cent. of the community, and even two and three per cent by
others--we, today, think that this is greatly over-estimated. </p>

<p>&quot;It was formerly held that drug addiction was so general
and so frequent that if the law-the Harrison Act-was enforced, as
it should be, a panic would be created by the immense numbers of
addicts who would seek relief. </p>

<p>&quot;The efforts of the New York City Department of Health,
actuated and urged by the Commissioner of Health, Dr. Royal S.
Copeland, showed that this fear of the production of a panic was
a false one. Our efforts were given wide publicity, and the
co-operation of medical and scientific societies earnestly and
zealously sought to help solve this problem. It might be added
also that the raids initiated by the Federal
authorities--arresting illicit prescribers and
dispensers-together with the New York State Narcotic Commission
requiring registration of all addicts in this locality, have not
occasioned any undue excitement among these individuals. We,
naturally, must infer that the enormous number of drug addicts
supposed to exist, in this vicinity at least (and it was supposed
to be greater here than anywhere else) are mythical and untrue
and that therefore the fear of a panic of these miserable
unfortunates was negative.&quot; </p>

<p>In his conclusion, Hubbard states: </p>

<p>&quot;The estimate of 1% of our population addicted to the use
of narcotic indulgence as a habit-addiction-is very likely
greatly exaggerated.&quot; </p>

<p>In his general statistics Hubbard gives as the number of users
registered during the operation of the clinic (about nine
months), 7464 of which 5882 were men and 1582 were women.
Applying the incidence indicated for New York City by the number
registered at the clinic, we obtain for the country as a whole
140,554 for the year 1919. </p>

<p>A number of factors combined to make the registration at the
New York City clinic incomplete. In the first place attendance
was voluntary. Further in New York City it was required that not
more than a twenty-four hour supply be furnished the addict, so
that it was necessary for individuals to visit their physicians
or the clinic daily in order to secure the drug legitimately.
This requirement tended to influence those for whom it was
impossible or too inconvenient to leave their business or work to
seek their supply from the illicit traffic or from legitimate
sources outside of the jurisdiction of this ruling. The number
registered, therefore, represents only those who, because of
difficulties in securing their supply by reason of the cost of
prescriptions or because the drug was sold more cheaply at the
clinic than at the retail drug store in spite of the twenty-four
hour ruling chose to attend the clinic. </p>

<p>Also there were several other factors operating, to keep
certain classes of users away from the clinic. First there was
the inconvenience of the crowded condition of the clinic where
applicants were required to stand outside in lines a block or
more long in any weather waiting their turn to be examined and
otherwise attended to. Second, there was the fixing of an
arbitrary dosage and then the enforced reduction by an arbitrary
amount. Third, it was required that a considerable amount of
personal information having nothing to do with their addiction,
such its the name of their employers and their addresses, be
supplied and that the photograph of the patient be attached to
the registration card. </p>

<p>Drug peddling in New York City was very rife at the time of
the operation of the clinic, and every opportunity was offered
those who could afford to pay the prices charged by the illicit
traffickers in drugs to secure their supplies without submitting
to the requirements of the twenty-four hour supply provisions or
registration at the clinic. </p>

<p>Narcotic Drug Control Commission-New York-1920 .22 </p>

<p>'Second Report of the Narcotic Control Commission. 1920. </p>

<p>Referring to the number of users in New York State,
Commissioner Herrick says: </p>

<p>&quot;I think a safe and conservative approximation would be
39,000. The records of the Department show in round numbers
13,000 registered addicts. This number is composed of those who
obtain habit-forming drugs through legitimate sources, that is,
directly from a doctor or on prescriptions issued by a doctor,
filled by a druggist, or from the different clinics established
throughout the State. To these figures should be added twice the
number, which is an approximation of the users who obtain drugs
from peddlers, or other illicit sources. Of course, this latter
figure, as I have stated, is only an approximation. I base it on
the percentage of addicts among the great number with whom I have
personally conferred, who have admitted that they obtained their
drugs from peddlers or other illicit sources. Between four-fifths
and two-thirds of the registered addicts are located in the city
of Greater New York, and the remaining fraction is scattered
throughout the rest of the State. The larger the center of
population the greater the percentage of addicts.&quot; </p>

<p>When applied to the country as a whole, Herrick's estimate of
39,000 addicts in New York State yields a figure of 396,978. </p>

<p>If Commissioner Herrick's statement that between four-fifths
and two-thirds of the registered users were located in the city
of Greater New York is correct, we have from 10,400 to 8,666 in
the Greater City by using his figure of &quot;in round numbers
13,000&quot; for the state as a whole or several thousand more
than were registered at the clinic. </p>

<p>It should be pointed out that however far Hubbard's figure
falls short of the actual number of users in New York by reason
of the forementioned factors, it is at least 500 too low if our
interpretation of the Commissioner's report is correct. According
to his statement, the Department of Narcotic Drug Control issued
exemptions for certain individuals who were not required to
register. The number of these exemptions was 500 in the
beginning, but later was reduced to 300. In attempting to
generalize, therefore, from the New York City clinic figures we
must bear in mind the apparently marked incompleteness of these
figures. The figure of 7,464 however, as a minimum, is a figure
of importance and of itself presents a serious problem, however
far it may come from indicating the actual conditions. </p>

<p>Los Angeles Clinic-1920. </p>

<p>In Los Angeles a narcotic clinic was operated from March 8 to
August 17, 1920-a period of a little over five months-at which
time, according to the report of the medical head, W. H. Bucher,
the clinic was closed by federal orders. During this brief period
there were registered at the clinic 582 persons-389 men and 193
women. In addition, knowledge was had of 37 individuals who were
not registered and given the drug because they were not working,
had previous undesirable records or gave insufficient evidence of
being chronic users. The exact number, therefore, of users was
unknown to the clinic authorities. In the case of Los Angeles as
in New York all opium users were not required to come to the
clinic and register nor were records kept of cases handled by
outside physicians. Another factor which tended to influence the
situation in Los Angeles and which did not obtain in like degree
in other localities where clinics were operated was the proximity
of this city to Mexico. Tile constant smuggling of the drug
furnished easy sources of supply to those who wished to avoid
registration at the clinic. </p>

<p>Taking, however, the Los Angeles figures as indicated by the
clinic registration for what they are worth, we find at least a
minimum of 564 known chronic opium users, giving an incidence
rate of about .1 70'. On the basis of the Los Angeles figure
there would be in the United States a total of 102,005 for 1920.
It will also be remembered that the Los Angeles clinic was in
operation for but five months, while in Jacksonville and
Tennessee registration of narcotic users covered a much longer
period. </p>

<p>'In using the phrase &quot;normal incidence&quot; as
indicating the cases of chronic opium usage caused through
medical practice, self-medication and constitutional make-up but
exclusive of cases stimulated by such artificial influences as
underworld association, illicit traffic, etc., we would not be
understood as meaning that the normal as at present existing is
an irreducible figure. We believe only that it is an actual
figure existing as of this time-the present period in medical
practice and lay knowledge-that with better medical education and
a more widespread dissemination among the laity of the facts of
chronic opium intoxication this &quot;normal&quot; in the future
materially will be lessened.<br>
</p>

<p>Shreveport, Louisiana, Clinic-1919-1923. </p>

<p>In many respects the next figures to be considered possess a
unique value. They were supplied by W. P. Butler, medical
director of the narcotic clinic at Shreveport, Louisiana, and
include the cases of chronic opium intoxication in the city of
Shreveport and Caddo Parish in which Shreveport is located,
comprising thus a territory including both urban and rural
population. Further they represent only resident cases.
Transients, non-residents or those who were induced possibly to
seek Shreveport because of the opportunity for attending a clinic
and profiting by treatment have all been eliminated by Dr. Butler
through his intimate personal knowledge of the circumstances
surrounding each case. The size of Shreveport, its relative
isolation from populous centres, the absence of large industries
and manufactories would all tend to minimize underworld
influences as etiologic factors of importance. For the most part
these cases represent those arising from the prescribing of these
drugs by physicians, from self-medication and that element which
everywhere, even without unusual opportunity or artificial
incitement, tends to seek adventure, stimulation or solace
through the use of narcotics. In other words, Butler's figures
represent more nearly than any others in our possession what
might be termed a normal incidence 23as existing in a community
where unusual exciting causes have not existed. </p>

<p>Further it should be remembered in considering these figures
that the operation of this clinic continued without interruption
for a period of nearly four years, from May 3, 1919, to February
10, 1923. This is a longer period of existence than has been
comprised in the life of any other narcotic clinic. The methods
employed by Butler, differing in several particulars from those
employed elsewhere in similar work and the support from local
officials, physicians and public combined to make this unusual
period of existence possible in view of the attitude of the
Bureau of Internal Revenue in regard to the operation of narcotic
clinics. </p>

<p>The local educational influence of the clinic undoubtedly was
very great in Shreveport and the adjoining rural districts, which
fact must not be lost sight of in attempting to generalize from
the Shreveport figures. Not only the very great majority of all
cases were handled personally by Dr. Butler and his staff-only a
very few remained in the hands of private physicians-but the
nature of the work was so thoroughly understood and so widely
endorsed by the local medical profession that it could not have
failed to have a deterrent effect upon the ill-advised, careless
or unnecessary prescribing and administering of opium
preparations in the ordinary practice of medicine. Therefore,
there must have been an influence during the operation of the
clinic tending to lessen rather than to increase the number of
new cases usually arising from and attributable to the unwise use
of opium by the practicing physician at large. In other words,
there appear to have been no artificial stimulating influences
toward narcotism but, on the contrary, there were present
influences which tended distinctly to lessen the formation of new
cases. </p>

<p>Also it should be noted that . during the operation of the
clinic the illicit traffic was reduced to the minimum if not
wholly eradicated. This matter received the particular attention
of the Bureau of Internal Revenue whose agents repeatedly visited
Shreveport and noted the conditions under which the clinic
operated. According to Butler, they stated to him as their
personal opinion that the drug was very scarce on the streets of
Shreveport; one agent made several attempts at different times to
buy the drug or to have it bought, but was unsuccessful. </p>

<p>It would-appear, therefore, that one may generalize with less
chance of error, at least on the side of exaggeration, from the
Shreveport figures than from those of any other locality. Further
in such generalizations we have a more nearly accurate portrayal
of the extent of the use of opium preparations in this country
arising from what we may term the more natural causes,-causes
inherent in all communities in which medicine is practiced,
painful illness is experienced and predisposing constitutional
tendencies do not exist in excess or are not influenced unduly by
artificial conditions-than in other generalizations. </p>

<p>In other communities, especially in the metropolitan centres
and industrial cities where racial, social and economic factors
lead to congested living conditions and tend to stimulate the
vicious employment of opium preparations for purposes solely of
dissipation, where prostitution is considerably more prevalent
and where peddling is highly profitable, we should expect a very
material increase in the underworld or vicious element among the
drug-using population as a whole. In addition to this, where
public and professional attention has not been continuously and
for a relatively long period directed at constructive effort
toward the elimination of this evil, we should not look for <i>n </i>decrease
in the drug-using population resulting from an increased caution
on the part of members of the medical profession. Whatever the
effect of these two influences in the causation of chronic opium
intoxication in such large centres as we have referred to here or
elsewhere, the cases attributable to them must be considered as
an increment in excess of those normally existing in these
communities and resulting from such widespread and omnipresent
causes as those apparently responsible and chiefly operative in
Shreveport. </p>

<p>The Shreveport incidence, therefore, of opium users for the
population at large may well be considered a minimum. </p>

<p>Had Butler not eliminated the non-resident and transient
cases, the cases recorded at the Shreveport clinic since its
inception would be 1,237. This figure, Dr. Butler states,
includes transients, residents, non-residents, and all those
dispensed to one time or more and comprises all cases handled by
the clinic from the date of its opening to February, 1923. In the
case of Shreveport, however, where the collection of information
has been made with unusual care and over a considerable period,
it has been possible for those in charge of the work to eliminate
artificial or unusual conditions and to determine with exactness
the true resident incidence. Butler reports this figure to be
371, which covers exclusively those residents registered and
cared for during a period of nearly four years. This figure,
however, cannot be used for the determination of the addiction
incidence in Shreveport, and for purposes of comparison with
other surveys for three reasons: First, it covers a period of
more than one year, while in the Tennessee, Jacksonville, Los
Angeles and other figures heretofore considered the numbers dealt
with surveys made during one calendar year; second, the figure is
a strictly resident figure, whereas the figures of the other
cities deal with the crude population; third, in Shreveport the
narcotic clinic and the hospital facilities for treatment
undoubtedly attracted addicts from other sections of the country,
as the figure of 1,237 given above indicates. Therefore, Doctor
Butler has supplied us with the number of addicts treated and
registered during one calendar year of the clinic, 1920. The
total number of cases treated in this year was 542, but into this
figure enters the error incident to the fact that numbers of
individuals came to Shreveport throughout the period of the
clinic because of the clinic and its facilities. In an attempt to
correct for this source of error, it was possible for Doctor
Butler to subdivide these 542 cases into residents and
non-residents, the basis for the former being residence in Caddo
Parish for a period of one year prior to registration at the
clinic. The resident figure for 1920 is 211, the non-resident
figure is 331. None of these figures unfortunately permits of
comparison with the figures dealing with addiction incidence in
other communities, inasmuch as these latter figures have included
the general run of population usually present in a community,
residents and transients, but they did not include-and there was
no reason why they should include-individuals especially
attracted because of a local situation having to do with the
special handling of opium addicts. The true number which would be
typical of Shreveport lies somewhere between the strict resident
figure of 211 and the exaggerated figure of 642. The resident
figure gives to Shreveport an opium user rate of .25%. Applied to
continental United States it would furnish a total of 264,276 for
1920. From what already has been said of the conditions under
which the Shreveport figures were obtained-the elimination of
non-residents, transients, drug traffickers-and from the absence
of unusual exciting causes which would<b> </b>lead to the
formation of any considerable percentage of vicious or underworld
cases, it is at once apparent that this figure represents a
minimum and must be considerably below the real number. For we
may not minimize without danger of serious underestimation what,
is so often reported by local and federal authorities throughout
the country as a powerful influence in the causation of this
condition in the younger age groups of both sexes, particularly
of males, namely, the etiologic factor comprised in under-world
associations and the instinct of the illicit trafficker. </p>

<p>In the preceding pages we have utilized such figures as we
have found available in an effort to show the extent of this
problem. These figures have been in sonic cases incomplete, and
in others, for one reason or another, subject to doubt or
controversy. Unfortunately a sufficient number of local surveys
at any given period has not been made to furnish material for a
reliable cross-section of the country. Conditions existing in one
section may be attacked with at least a show of justice when
applied to others. Population composition, occupation, and even
climate, to say nothing of many other sociologic influences, tend
to vitiate generalizations made from local data of this kind. </p>

<p>For comparison we are giving in the following table the
findings of the surveys suitable for purposes of generalization
together with certain computations based thereon. The other
surveys of which we have record are too incomplete or for one
reason or another too inconclusive to warrant their use as bases
for general estimates. </p>

<p>A more recent estimate 24<b> </b>of the number of addicts in
the United States is that of Lawrence Kolb and A. G. Du Mez of
the United States Public Health Service. While not based on an
original survey of a community or section of the country, the
estimate of these authors is of interest as a result of their
analysis of certain recent surveys and other data. In their
introduction they state: </p>

<p>'Kolb, Lawrence, and A. G. Du Mez---'The Prevalence and Trend
of Drug Addiction in the United States and Factors Influencing
It.&quot; Public Health Reports--May 28, 1924. </p>

<p>&quot;It is realized that it is impossible at the present time
to make an exact count of the persons addicted to narcotics in
the United States in an individual State, or even in one of our
larger cities, because of the social and legal factors tending to
make addiction a secret practice. It is believed, however, that
it is possible, by utilizing all of the information now
available, to delimit the number by certain maximum and minimum
figures. With this object in view, a number of the more important
narcotic surveys made in recent years were analyzed; also the
reports made by agents of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and
other persons on the narcotic clinics conducted in different
parts of the country; statistics on the dose of addiction, world
production of narcotics, and the quantities imported into this
country were compiled and studied; and numerous physicians in
different parts of the country were interviewed in person to
ascertain the number of addicts they were treating in the course
of their practice. The results of these analyses and studies
follow:&quot; </p>

<p>After their analysis of the surveys and clinic reports, they
conclude as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;In summing up it may be stated that according to Brown's
survey, 215,000 was approximately the number of addicts in the
United States in 1915. The New York City, the Treasury
Department, and the clinic surveys were made four or five years
later. An objection to making a general application of the New
York City survey is that the sex and age distribution of addicts
shown by it does not obtain throughout the country. This was
probably due in part to the fact already referred to, namely,
that young addicts are attracted to large cities, and conditions
exist in them which cause a delinquent type of addiction; and it
is also due in part to the fact that some of the older addicts
were being taken care of by physicians and were not counted when
the survey was made. Just how far these two factors balance each
other is not known, but the 140,600 indicated by the New York
City survey in 1920 shows a reduction over the 1915 figures. The
clinic surveys made at the same time or a year later took in
nearly all sections of the country and comprised a more
representative group of population. These surveys show 104,300
addicts.' The Pennsylvania figures, collected over a period of
five years and ending about a year after the clinics were closed,
show approximately 109,250 addicts in the United States in 1922
when the actual count of 9,000 is used. The Army rate is
undoubtedly too low for the particular group surveyed, and for
reasons already given for estimating addiction in the population
as a whole. The 1918 Treasury Department survey shows 237,655
addicts and apparently contains an indeterminate error of
exaggeration, as already pointed out. The highest estimate based
on any unrevised survey is 269,000; the lowest, exclusive of the
Army survey, is 104,300. These figures may therefore be accepted
as the maximum and minimum numbers for the period 1915 to 1922;
but from what has been brought out relative to the surveys it
would seem that somewhat less than 215,000 is more nearly correct
for the beginning and about 110,000 the approximate number for
the end of the period.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="op100006.gif" align="bottom" width="452"
height="324"> </p>

<p>The second part of their report is a consideration of the
estimated number of addicts &quot;based on dosage and available
supplies.&quot; Using as a basis for their computations an
average daily dose of six grains of morphin sulphate, which they
state they obtained as a result of their studies, the authors
show in tabular form in ten-year periods in the next table the
number of addicts who would be supplied if all of the opium
entered for consumption were used for addicts. </p>

<p>They state: </p>

<p>&quot;These figures are given for a period prior to the time
when restrictions were placed on the traffic in opium, and there
was no incentive to the smuggling trade as there is to-day. It is
therefore believed that at no time have there been more than
246,000 opium addicts in the United States.&quot; </p>

<p>' A press release from the Narcotic Division of the
Prohibition Unit, Bureau of Internal Revenue, dated May 4, 1924,
states: &quot;It is estimated that there are upwards of 500,000
drug addicts in the United States . . . . .. </p>

<p>Following the same reasoning in regard to the total world
production of opium these authors conclude that at this rate
&quot;the total annual production of opium, exclusive of that
produced in the countries of the Far East, if used entirely for
the satisfaction of addiction, would supply only about 566,000
addicts.&quot; </p>

<p>It is necessary to emphasize, as the authors themselves have
pointed out, how impossible it is to obtain accurate statistics
on the world opium production. The data upon which the above
estimate of 566,000 was based were obtained from statistics
compiled by the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium of the
League of Nations who the authors state, &quot;admits that the
figures given are only estimates in the majority of cases.&quot;
Further it should- be remembered that the annual production
figures vary from year to year and an estimate based on the
figures for one year-the above estimate of 566,000 is based on
the production figures of 1922-is true for that year alone,
granting that the figures are correct, and may be quite different
from those based on figures of other years. </p>

<p><img src="op100007.gif" align="bottom" width="456"
height="347"> </p>

<p>They continue: </p>

<p>&quot;It has been shown that at no time have the annual
importations of narcotic drugs into this country been greater
than would be necessary to supply 264,000 addicts, assuming that
they were used in their entirety for the satisfaction of
addiction. No one contends that they were so used, but it has
been asserted that at least 75 per cent of the quantities
imported are used for this purpose. It is believed that a fairly
accurate estimate of the amounts used for the satisfaction of
addiction subsequent to 1909, when the entry of smoking opium was
prohibited, can be obtained by using the import statistics given
in Tables 2 and 3. </p>

<p>&quot;For the four-year period, 1920-1923, the importations of
opium amounted to 144,805 pounds annually. For this same period
5,282 ounces of opium alkaloids were imported annually. The
narcotic division of the Bureau of Internal Revenue estimates
that not over 15 per cent of these quantities get into
illegitimate channels. Making these deductions it may be assumed
that 123,084 pounds of opium and 4,490 ounces of opium alkaloids
are required annually to supply the legitimate medicinal needs of
the country, including the needs of many old and incurable
addicts now being supplied by physicians, which number is
constantly decreasing. By subtracting these amounts from the
amounts imported annually for the decade 1910 to 1919 we obtain
242,971 pounds of opium and 22,653 ounces of opium alkaloids. </p>

<p>&quot;These quantities would supply approximately 100,000
addicts for a year. Making similar computations for coca leaves
and coca leaf alkaloids, it is found that approximately 9,000
addicts could be supplied with the quantities which were formerly
imported in excess of what has been imported in recent years.
This would make a total of 109,000 addicts who, prior to 1915,
could have obtained their supplies of narcotics from the
quantities imported legally. In view of the limited supplies of
medicinal opium available in the world and the rigid control of
narcotics exercised by this country, it is highly improbable that
the combined quantities available to addicts in 1919 and 1920
from smuggled sources and from leakage through legitimate
channels were more than sufficient to supply the number
(109,000). This is probably too high, in view of the reduction
which has been shown, but if we add to this figure the number of
aged and incurable addicts who received their supplies through
legitimate channels, the total number of addicts in this country
for the period stated was probably somewhere between 120,000 and
140,000, which is in keeping with the figures arrived at from the
surveys and clinic reports. </p>

<p>&quot;That the quantities of narcotics smuggled into this
country are in all likelihood not as great as is believed by
some, is shown by the quantities reported as falling into the
possession of the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the enforcement
of the narcotic laws. For the year ending June 30, 1922, the
total quantity, including opium and coca leaves, preparations
containing opium and coca leaves, the alkaloids of opium and
cocaine, and preparations containing these alkaloids, was only
4,447 pounds. In 1923 it was 542 pounds.&quot; </p>

<p>In connection with the above statements, we should like to
point out that in our opinion a decrease in the amount of drug
confiscated does not necessarily indicate a decrease in
smuggling. The report of the Special Committee of the Treasury
Department, 1918, states that </p>

<p>&quot;in recent years, especially since the enactment of the
Harrison law, the traffic by 'underground' channels has increased
enormously, and at the present time it is believed to be equally
as extensive as that carried on in a legitimate manner!&quot; How
much of this traffic found its source of supply in smuggling and
to what extent the activities of the federal bureau charged with
the enforcement of the law have diminished smuggling operations
since 1918, we are unable to say. However, we believe that the
significance of the above statement should be considered. </p>

<p>Earlier in this chapter we have. pointed out the
undesirability of attempting to make an estimate of the number of
addicts based on the amount of the drug available for consumption
and the average daily dose. We again wish to point out the
present lack of data, at least in our experience, which would
warrant the acceptance of any figure as a representative average
daily dose for addicts. </p>

<p>From their interviews with physicians the authors conclude as
follows: </p>

<p>&quot;Confirmation of the estimates based on the supplies of
narcotics available and on the findings of the various surveys as
to the number of addicts and the trend of narcotic addiction in
the United States is furnished by the experience of physicians as
related to us. We have interviewed physicians from all parts of
the United States and it is unusual to find one who has an addict
among his patients. Few besides those who have contact with penal
institutions and sanitariums meet any great number. Many
physicians still occasionally see a transient addict who drops in
and begs for a dose, but this, too, is growing rare. Some of the
physicians who have been practicing for years in small towns and
rural communities speak of addicts they have cured by the aid of
the Harrison law or who have, without outside assistance, cured
themselves. Some of them are taking care of one or more old or
incurable cases but from the information they give it seems that
new cases of addiction are not arising to take the place of the
old ones who die. </p>

<p>&quot;The accuracy of our observation is Supported by the
findings of Dr. Carleton Simon, special deputy police
commissioner in charge of the narcotic division of the police
department of New York City, who sent out a questionnaire to the
physicians in New York State. Of the 7,599 physicians who
replied, only 52 per cent reported that they were treating
addicts in 1922.&quot; </p>

<p>Two questions arise as to the justification of the above
deductions based on interviews with physicians throughout the
country; first, were a sufficient and representative number of
physicians interviewed to portray a fair picture of existing
conditions; and second, is it reasonable to expect that the
majority of addicts under present conditions place themselves in
the hands of physicians? In regard to the latter question we
believe that for reasons pointed out in the following chapter the
tendency of the physician is to avoid contact with the problem of
addiction. </p>

<p>As a final conclusion in regard to the present number of
addicts, the authors state: </p>

<p>&quot;The evidence seems to show that a maximum estimate for
the number of addicts in the United States at the present time
would be 150,000. The estimates based on actual counts and on the
available supplies of narcotics, together with conditions
reported by the physicians interviewed, point to about 110,000,
which number is believed to be nearly correct.&quot; </p>

<p>In general, a review of the material already covered in this
chapter will show it in the above study in the first place
certain surveys have not been taken into consideration and in the
second place, incorrect deductions have been drawn from two of
the official reports cited. Among the first may be named the
Jacksonville, Fla., survey made in 1913, about a year before the
Tennessee study. A consideration of the earlier surveys may have
been omitted because of the supposed existence of different
influencing factors by reason of time. In regard to this point we
believe that however different conditions may be at the present
time, the changes have not been great enough to eliminate
completely the significance of these early figures. </p>

<p>In regard to the second point, namely the incorrect
deductions, it is true that there actually were reported only
73,150 addicts in the survey made by the special committee of the
Treasury Department, 1918, which on the basis of 100 per cent
replies would yield 237,655 addicts under treatment in the entire
country. The report from which they take this figure has already
been considered above. The figure which they quote is not given
in the original report as the committee's estimate of the total
number of addicts in the country, but only as the estimated
number of addicts under treatment by physicians during the period
when the survey was made, as the report states, I............
only a small portion of the total number of addicts presented
themselves for treatment. Addicts of the 'underworld', for
instance, secure most of their supply through illicit channels
and rarely, if ever, consult a physician.&quot; Further, had Kolb
and Du Mez employed the figures resulting from queries sent to
health officials they would have reached a total for the country
of 420,000 addicts, which figure, the committee's report states,
&quot;appears to be much too low in view of the fact that the
physicians of the country are estimated to have bad about 237,000
addicts under treatment during the same period.&quot; Further on
the report of the Treasury Department, after considering the
errors potentially residing in all of the -figures presented,
both from general and local sources, reaches the following
conclusion: &quot;Taking these facts into consideration, the
committee is of the opinion that the total number of addicts in
this country probably exceeds 1,000,000 at the present time,'-a
statement which Kolb and Du Mez did not take into account. Again,
these authors quoted only the lower figures and lost sight of the
final estimate of the number of addicts in the state of New York
made by Commissioner Herrick in his report of the work of the
Narcotic Control Commission when he states: </p>

<p>&quot;I think a safe and conservative approximation would be
39,000. The records of the Department show in round numbers
13,000 registered addicts. This number is composed of those who
obtain habit-forming drugs through legitimate sources, that is,
directly from a doctor or on prescriptions issued by a doctor,
filled by a druggist, or from the different clinics established
throughout the State. To these figures should be added twice the
number, which is an approximation of the users who, obtain drugs
from peddlers, or other illicit sources. Of course, this latter
figure, as I have stated, is only an approximation. I base it on
the percentage of addicts among the great number with whom I have
personally conferred, who have admitted that they obtained their
drugs from peddlers or other illicit sources.&quot; </p>

<p>The importance of these estimates in relation to their use as
a basis for further estimates or comparisons is obvious. </p>

<p>Finally in view of the various considerations pointed out in
regard to the above study, we cannot agree that the ultimate
estimate of 110,000 is warranted. While we on the one hand
deplore unjustifiable, sensational exaggerations, on the other,
we recognize the danger of basing maximal estimates on selected
data. </p>

<p>One other method of arriving at a satisfying conclusion as to
the extent of this problem exists. It is quite remote from what
we may terra the mathematical procedure, and, while neither
specific in its application nor concerned with actual numbers,
includes presumptive evidence of such importance and brings into
consideration such deeprooted human attributes and such
well-known characteristics as to render it, perhaps, the most
important method of all, while, parodoxical as it may seem, the
least definite. We refer to a review of the growth </p>

<p>in the use of opium through the many and varied motives as
presented and revealed by available historic record. That there
has been a continuous, marked increase in the consumption of
opium and its products in the United States, at least through
1915, is shown in the following table of importations. The supply
has but filled the demand. Tile conclusion is inevitable that the
number of chronic users, for one reason or another, steadily has
been increasing, as upon the basis of the therapeutic use of
these drugs alone-in the treatment of disease other than that of
chronic opium intoxication-such an increase would have been
impossible. In 1915 two things occurred simultaneously, the
importations decreased and the illicit traffic began to develop.
This doubtless was due chiefly to the fact that chronic users,
because of the restrictions placed upon physicians and
pharmacists in the handling of these drugs, sought their supplies
from underworld sources. It does not mean necessarily that the
consumption of opium has decreased. </p>

<p>Inasmuch as this comprises a study of the development of the
problem of chronic opium intoxication we shall take it up in a
separate chapter, tracing its progress through the early
unrestricted use and popularity of opium to relieve pain in that
period of medical enlightenment when attention was directed at
symptoms rather than cause, the ignorance of the dangers of
continued use, the discovery of its value for therapeutic uses,
the influence of such writings as De Quincey's and others of his
day, the introduction and widespread use of the hypodermic
syringe, the influence of the Civil War and other wars, the
practice of opium smoking, the influence of the patent medicine
industry, the discovery and use of heroin, the illicit traffic
which has grown up since the enactment of anti-narcotic laws and
the general lack of interest and laxness in medical teachings and
practice in the employment of opium preparations. </p>

<p>RESUME </p>

<p>The period covered in the foregoing material dates from the
earliest time in which this problem in the United States appears
to have received individual or public recognition up to the
present time. From beginning to end the material is fragmentary.
Altogether very few surveys have been made and those that do
exist are more or less imperfect due to one or another vitiating
factor. Incompleteness seems to be an outstanding feature of
practically all surveys. This may be explained by the nature of
the problem and the prevailing early and present attitudes toward
the individuals affected, as a result of which they are not
inclined to reveal their condition. Other influences tending to
render the surveys already made inapplicable to generalization
are community variations such as race composition, method of
conducting survey, method of registration, classes represented in
survey, attitude and experience of investigators, etc. Moreover,
singularly enough, in spite of a growing interest evinced in the
problem as a result of the enactment of the Harrison Narcotic
Act, the results of several of the earlier investigations appear
better adapted to generalization than most of those made public
since the enforcement of this law. In consideration of the above
factors it must be concluded that we do not know the total number
of opiate users in the United States today. </p>

<p>Whatever their inaccuracies, these surveys and estimates
indicate sufficiently clearly the existence of a major
medico-social problem to make the denial of the existence of a
general situation far more dangerous than its affirmation. As a
matter of fact, it is not necessary to know the exact number of
users or even the minimal extent, to realize that there are a
large number in the country and that the problem is serious.<br>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Report </b></p>

<h1>FOREWORD </h1>

<p><b>by Fiorello LaGuardia</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>As Mayor of the City of New York, it is my duty to foresee and
take steps to prevent the development of hazards to the health,
safety, and welfare of our citizens. When rumors were recently
circulated concerning the smoking of marihuana by large segments
of our population and even by school children, I sought advice
from The New York Academy of Medicine, as is my custom when
confronted with problems of medical import. On the Academy's
recommendation I appointed a special committee to make a thorough
sociological and scientific investigation, and secured funds from
three Foundations with which to finance these studies. </p>

<p>My own interest in marihuana goes back many years, to the time
when I was a member of the House of Representatives and, in that
capacity, heard of the use of marihuana by soldiers stationed in
Panama. I was impressed at that time with the report of an Army
Board of Inquiry which emphasized the relative harmlessness of
the drug and the fact that it played a very little role, if any,
in problems of delinquency and crime in the Canal Zone. </p>

<p>The report of the present investigations covers every phase of
the problem and is of practical value not only to our own city
but to communities throughout the country. It is a basic
contribution to medicine and pharmacology. I am glad that the
sociological, psychological, and medical ills commonly attributed
to marihuana have been found to be exaggerated insofar as the
City of New York is concerned. I hasten to point out, however,
that the findings are to be interpreted only as a reassuring
report of progress and not as encouragement to indulgence, for I
shall continue to enforce the laws prohibiting the use of
marihuana until and if complete findings may justify an amendment
to existing laws. The scientific part of the research will be
continued in the hope that the drug may prove to possess
therapeutic value for the control of drug addiction. </p>

<p>I take this occasion to express my appreciation and gratitude
to the members of my committee, to The New York Academy of
Medicine, and to the Commonwealth Fund, the Friedsam Foundation,
and the New York Foundation which supported these important
investigations so generously.<br>
</p>

<p>F. H. LaGuardia </p>

<p>Mayor<br>

<h1>INTRODUCTION </h1>

<p><b>E. H. L. Corwin, PhD, Secretary</b></p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On September 13, 1938, The New York Academy of Medicine was
informed of Mayor LaGuardia's concern about the marihuana problem
and of his desire &quot;that some impartial body such as The New
York Academy of Medicine make a survey of existing knowledge on
this subject and carry out any observations required to determine
the pertinent facts regarding this form of drug addiction and the
necessity for its control.&quot; The Mayor's request was referred
to the Committee on Public Health Relations of the Academy, which
Committee on October 17, 1938, authorized the appointment of a
special subcommittee to study the Mayor's request. </p>

<p>This Subcommittee, consisting of Dr. George B. Wallace,
Chairman, Dr. E. H. L. Corwin, Secretary, and Drs. McKeen
Cattell, Leon H. Cornwall, Robert F. Loeb, Currier McEwen, B. S.
Oppenheimer, Charles Diller Ryan, and Dudley D. Shoenfeld,
reviewed the existing literature on the subject. On the basis of
this review, the Subcommittee could come to no conclusion
regarding the effect of marihuana upon the psychological and
physiological functions of the human being. Nor were attempts to
learn the extent of the use of marihuana in New York City any
more successful. A conference with representatives of the Police
Department, the Department of Education, the Department of
Correction, the Psychiatric Division of the Department of
Hospitals, the Court of Domestic Relations, the District
Attorney's office, and the Citizens Committee on the Control of
Crime served to emphasize the existing differences of opinion
regarding the extent of the use of marihuana in this city and its
relationship to crime. </p>

<p>The Subcommittee therefore came to the conclusion that, in
view of the possibility that marihuana smoking might constitute
an important social problem, it was time that a study of its
effects be made based upon well-established evidence, and
prepared an outline of methods of procedure for the study of the
problem. It recommended that such a study should be divided into
two parts: ( 1 ) a sociological study dealing with the extent of
marihuana smoking and the methods by which the drug is obtained;
in what districts and among what races, classes or types of
persons the use is most prevalent; whether certain social
conditions are factors in its use, and what relation there is
between its use and criminal or antisocial acts; and (2) a
clinical study to determine by means of controlled experiments
the physiological and psychological effects of marihuana on
different types of persons; the question as to whether it causes
physical or mental deterioration; and its possible therapeutic
effects in the treatment of disease or of other drug addictions. </p>

<p>The Committee on Public Health Relations adopted the report of
its Subcommittee and recommended to Mayor LaGuardia that he
appoint a special committee to carry out the proposed study.
Accordingly in January 1939 he appointed the Mayor's Committee on
Marihuana, composed of the members of the Subcommittee of the
Committee on Public Health Relations which recommended the study
and four ex-officio members: Dr. Peter F. Amoroso, First Deputy
Commissioner (later Commissioner) of Correction; Dr. Karl M.
Bowman, Director of the Psychiatric Division of the Department of
Hospitals; Dr. S. S. Goldwater, Commissioner of Hospitals- and
Dr. John L. Rich, Commissioner of Health. Upon his accession to
the commissionership of the Department of Hospitals, Dr. Willard
C. Rappleye succeeded Dr. Goldwater as a member of this
Committee. This Committee studied the broad outlines of the
proposed plans for about a year before work was actually begun. </p>

<p>At its first meeting in March 1939 two subcommittees were
appointed; one, consisting of Drs. Shoenfeld, Ryan, and Corwin,
to plan the sociological study, and the other, composed of Drs.
Cattell, Bowman, Cornwall, and Loeb, to work out the details of
the clinical study. Drs. Bowman and Wechsler were appointed as
special advisers for the clinical study and Dr. J. Murray Steele
and Dr. S. Bernard Wortis as the supervisors of this study. </p>

<p>The studies were made possible by the financial support of
three Foundations, the Friedsam Foundation, the New York
Foundation, and the Commonwealth Fund, each of which donated
$7,500. The whole amounts granted by the Friedsam Foundation and
the Commonwealth Fund and $5,000 of the New York Foundation's
grant were to be applied to the clinical study- the remaining
$2,500 given by the New York Foundation was earmarked for the
sociological study. The Research Council of the Department of
Hospitals undertook the financial supervision of the clinical
study and The New York Academy of Medicine that of the
sociological study. </p>

<p>The sociological study proceeded under the active direction of
Dr. Dudley D. Shoenfeld and was carried out by six police
officers who were trained by Dr. Shoenfeld as social
investigators. In acknowledgment of the great help rendered to
the Committee by these officers, the Committee passed the
following resolution at its meeting on March 18, 1941.<br>
</p>

<p>Now that the sociological study of the marihuana problem in
New York City has been completed, the Mayor's Committee on
Marihuana wishes to record its appreciation of the Mayor's
interest in this problem and his placing at the disposal of the
Committee the services of the Narcotic Squad Division of the
Police Department. Without the cooperation of Commissioner
Valentine, Inspector Curtayne, Lieutenant Cooper, Sergeant
Boylan, and Detective Loures, this study would have been
impossible. They helped in planning it and assigned to the
Committee six members of the Force, four men and two women, whose
intelligence, interest in the work, and desire to obtain the
facts of the situation were of invaluable aid in obtaining the
information on which the sociological report is based. The four
men and two women assigned to us made painstaking observations
and reports, acted as investigators and social workers and not as
police officers, and brought to the performance of this task a
native intelligence, specialized training, and civic interest.
The thanks of the Committee are due to them and through them to
their superiors.<br>
</p>

<p>The clinical study consisted of two parts; the medical,
including psychiatric, and the psychological. Dr. Karl M. Bowman
directed the medical and psychiatric part of this study and Dr.
David Wechsler the psychological part. The members of the
Committee closely supervised the work during the course of the
study. The staff of the clinical study included: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Samuel Allentuck, MD, Psychiatrist, who was in charge. </li>
    <li>Louis Gitzelter, MD </li>
    <li>Frank Anker, MD Assistant Physicians </li>
    <li>Robert S. Morrow, PhD </li>
    <li>Florence Halpern, MA </li>
    <li>Adolph G. Woltmann,MA Psychologists </li>
    <li>Miss Rose Horowitz, who was the secretary-stenographer
        and bookkeeper.<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The Committee is indebted to the Department of Hospitals for
making available two small wards and office space in the Welfare
Hospital (now known as the Goldwater Memorial Hospital), to Dr.
Chrisman G. Scheri, the Superintendent of the hospital, and to
the laboratory staff of the Third Medical Division for their
assistance in the conduct of laboratory experiments.
Acknowledgment should also be made of the services of Dr. Robert
C. Batterman who interpreted the electrocardiograms and Dr. Hans
Strauss for the electroencephalographic work. Professor Walter R.
Miles of Yale University assisted in the planning of the
psychological part of the study. This whole undertaking would
have been impossible without the help and cooperation of Dr.
Peter F. Amoroso, of the Department of Correction, who, aside
from his services as a member of the Committee, was responsible
for arrangements for volunteers from among the prisoners of the
Riker's Island Penitentiary. Thanks are due also to the medical
staff of the Riker's Island Hospital for their assistance in the
narcotic addiction study. </p>

<p>At the suggestion of Dr. Cattell a pharmacological study was
done in the Department of Pharmacology of Cornell Medical School
by Dr. S. Loewe. Dr. W. Modell collaborated in this work. We are
indebted to Dr. Roger Adams, Professor of Chemistry at the
University of Illinois, and to Dr. H. J. Wollner, Consulting
Chemist of the United States Treasury Department, who supplied
some of the active principles of marihuana which were used in the
study. </p>

<p>The names of those who conducted the investigations are given
under the different chapters. Those sections of the report for
which no author is indicated have been written by the Chairman of
the Committee. </p>

<p>The tremendous task of compiling, editing, and revising the
reports was undertaken by Dr. George B. Wallace, the chairman of
the Committee, and Miss Elizabeth V. Cunningham of the staff of
the Committee on Public Health Relations of The New York Academy
of Medicine. They had the assistance of Dr. Dudley D. Shoenfeld,
who prepared the sociological report, Dr. David Wechsler, who
revised the psychological reports, and Dr. McKeen Cattell, who
edited the pharmacological report. </p>

<p>In the judgment of the Committee, this painstaking study
should be of considerable value from a scientific and social
viewpoint. </p>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report,</b> </p>

<p><b>THE SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY</b> </p>

<p><b>Dudley D. Shoenfeld, MD<br>
</b></p>

<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<hr>

<p>In order to understand fully the purpose and scope of this
particular part of the survey conducted by the Mayor's Committee
on Marihuana, a brief digest of the history of the growth and
usage of this drug is essential. </p>

<p>Indian hemp, from which marihuana (the American synonym for
hashish) is obtained, has been known to man for more than three
thousand years. This plant, although originally indigenous to
Central Asia, is now found in practically every section of the
world, growing either wild or cultivated, legally or illegally. </p>

<p>When originally discovered, the use to which this plant was
principally put was the conversion of its fiber for commerical
purposes in the production of cord, twine and textiles. Shortly
thereafter its pharmaceutical properties were employed in the
practice of medicine and surgery. Authoritative proof is
available that the Chinese found it valuable as an effective
anesthetic in surgery as far back as two thousand years. It was
not until approximately the tenth century that the peoples of
Africa and Asia began to use it in a rather indiscriminate manner
for its intoxicating effects. </p>

<p>Very shortly after its usage became popular, this drug engaged
the attention of the various African and Asian governments, as
well as of lay persons interested in medical, religious and
sociological problems. Some of these very early investigators
propounded the theory that physical and mental deterioration was
the direct result of smoking hashish. Others extolled its
benefits, deeming it actually essential to life, and urged people
to indulge in it. </p>

<p>During this early period, the peoples of Europe were aware of
the use of hashish in Africa and Asia, and considered it a vice
particularly common to the peoples of those continents. In the
nineteenth century their interest was raised to a high pitch
because of the fictional reports of the smoking of hashish given
by the romanticists of that period. These individuals, who had
the power of the pen, experimentally indulged in the smoking of
hashish, and described in an expansive, subjective manner the
effects the drug had upon them. A review of the fanciful
literature reveals that in most instances these writings referred
to the authors' experiences with toxic doses. Summed up, the
conclusions were that hashish could cause psychotic episodes and
even death and that prolonged use would result in physical and
mental deterioration. The exalted position held by these
romanticists tended to influence the Europeans to accept their
conclusions as scientific monographs on the subject of hashish,
so that the smoking of hashish did not become popular with them.
However, in recent years there has been a fairly wide
participation on the part of Europeans in smoking hashish or
marihuana, but it is referred to as an American vice. This allows
one to infer that whereas the knowledge pertaining to this habit
was very early recognized in Europe, at the present time
participation in it is from their point of view the direct result
of its introduction into Europe not from Africa and Asia, but
from America. </p>

<p>In America, Indian hemp was planted in the New England
colonies, solely for commercial purposes, as early as the
seventeenth century. At the present time it can be found growing
either wild or cultivated, legally or illegally, in practically
all our states. Lawful cultivation is confined principally to the
states of Kentucky, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. It has
been estimated that not more than ten thousand acres are devoted
to its legal production. It is of value commercially in the
manufacture of rope, twine, and textiles. The seed is used for
bird- food, and the oil extracted from the seed is occasionally
used as a substitute for linseed oil in the preparation of
artists' paints. A rosin extracted from the plant is used in the
production of pharmaceutical preparations. </p>

<p>Since the history of hemp cultivation in America dates back to
the seventeenth century, it is exceedingly interesting, but
difficult to explain, that the smoking of marihuana did not
become a problem in our country until approximately twenty years
ago, and that it has become an acute problem associated with a
great deal of publicity only in the past ten years. </p>

<p>The origin of the word &quot;marihuana&quot; is in doubt. Some
authorities are of the opinion that it is derived from the
Portuguese word &quot;mariguano,&quot; meaning intoxicant. Others
are of the opinion that it has its derivation in the Mexican
words for &quot;Mary and Jane.&quot; The introduction into the
United States of the practice of smoking marihuana has been the
subject of a great deal of speculation. The most tenable
hypothesis at the present time is that it was introduced by
Mexicans entering our country. </p>

<p>It is accepted that in Mexico marihuana smoking is an old,
established practice. Therefore, it would appear logical to
assume that Mexican laborers crossing our border into the
Southwest carried this practice with them. Having used marihuana
in their native land, they found it natural to continue smoking
it in the new country, and planted it for personal consumption.
Once available, it was soon made use of by our citizens. At the
present time, the smoking of marihuana is widespread in this
nation. </p>

<p>Believing that marihuana smoking might be deleterious, and
knowing it to be widespread, federal and municipal governments,
private individuals, and such agencies as the Opium Advisory
Association, the International Narcotic Education Association,
and others investigated the subject. These investigative
organizations have contributed a great deal of data and pertinent
information to the knowledge of the use of marihuana. The mass of
information so obtained when untangled can be summed up with the
general statement that a majority of investigators are of the
opinion that marihuana smoking is deleterious, although a
minority maintain that it is innocuous. The majority believe that
marihuana smoking is widespread among school children; that the
dispensers of the drug are organized to such an extent that they
encourage the use of marihuana in order to create an ever-
increasing market; that juvenile delinquency is directly related
to the effects of the drug; that it is a causative factor in a
large percentage of our major crimes and sexual offenses; and
that physical and mental deterioration are the direct result of
the prolonged habit of smoking marihuana. </p>

<p>As a result of these official and semi-official conclusions in
regard to the disastrous effects produced by this habit, the
newspapers and magazines of our country have given it wide
publicity. At this point it may be profitable to give the
conclusions of some of the investigators and quote the publicity
associated with it. In a pamphlet &quot;Marihuana or Indian Hemp
and Its Preparations&quot; issued by the International Narcotic
Education Association, one finds: </p>

<p><b>(quotation)</b> </p>

<p>Marihuana is a most virile and powerful stimulant. The
physiological effect of this drug produces a peculiar psychic
exaltation and derangement of the central nervous system. The
stage of exaltation and confusion, more marked in some addicts
than in others, is generally followed by a stage of depression.
Sometimes the subject passes into a semi- conscious state,
experiencing vivid and extravagant dreams which vary according to
the individual character and mentality. In some the stage is one
of self-satisfaction and well-being. In others, it is alarming,
presenting the fear of some imminent and indefinite danger or of
impending death. Later the dreams are sometimes followed by a
state of complete unconsciousness. Sometimes convulsive attacks
and acute mania are developed. </p>

<p>The narcotic content in marihuana decreases the rate of heart
beat and causes irregularity of the pulse. Death may result from
the effect upon the heart. Prolonged use of marihuana frequently
develops a delirious rage which sometimes leads to high crimes,
such as assault and murder. Hence marihuana has been called the
&quot;killer drug.&quot; The habitual use of this narcotic poison
always causes a very marked mental deterioration and sometimes
produces insanity. Hence marihuana is frequently called
&quot;loco weed.&quot; (Loco is the Spanish word for crazy.) </p>

<p>While the marihuana habit leads to physical wreckage and
mental decay, its effects upon character and morality are even
more devastating. The victim frequently undergoes such degeneracy
that he will lie and steal without scruple; he becomes utterly
untrustworthy and often drifts into the underworld where, with
his degenerate companions, he commits high crimes and
misdemeanors. Marihuana sometimes gives man the lust to kill
unreasonably and without motive. Many cases of assault, rape,
robbery, and murder are traced to the use of maribuana.(1) </p>

</p>

<p>In an article published in the New York Daily Worker, New
York, Saturday, December 28, 1940, there appeared under the
column headed &quot;HEALTH ADVICE&quot;:<br>
</p>

<p><b>(start quoted article)</b> </p>

<p><b>A DRUG AND INSANITY.</b> </p>

<p>Bill Wilson was strolling by his favorite soda joint on the
way home from high school when he heard a familiar voice whisper
loudly, &quot;Hey, Bill, c'mere.&quot; Behind the Texaco
billboard, he found his side-kick Jim, who said excitedly,
&quot;I got some reefers!&quot; &quot;Reefers, what're
they?&quot; </p>

<p>Mysteriously, Jim reached into his pocket and pulled out two
large cigarettes. &quot;Marihuana!&quot; Jim's pupils dilated.
&quot;Come on over to the club and we'll smoke 'em. Boy, that's
fun!&quot; Bill is only one of thousands of new marihuana smokers
created yearly among boys and girls of high school age. </p>

<p>What is this drug? It is a narcotic in the same class as opium
and is derived from a plant, which grows wild, extensively in
some parts. For this reason, it is hard to control and the drug
is easy to obtain at very little cost. Smoking of the weed is
habit-forming. It destroys the willpower, releases restraints,
and promotes insane reactions. Continued use causes the face to
become bloated, the eyes bloodshot, the limbs weak and trembling,
and the mind sinks into insanity. Robberies, thrill murders, sex
crimes and other offenses result. </p>

<p>When the habit is first started, the symptoms are milder, yet
powerful enough. The smoker loses all sense of time and space so
that he can't judge distances, he loses his self-control, and his
imagination receives considerable stimulation. </p>

<p>The habit can be cured only by the most severe methods. The
addict must be put into an institution, where the drug is
gradually withdrawn, his general health is built up, and he is
kept there until he has enough willpower to withstand the
temptation to again take to the weed. </p>

<p>The spread of this terrible fad can be stopped only when the
unscrupulous criminals trafficking In the drug are rooted out. </p>

<p><b>(end quoted article)<br>
</b></p>

<p>Dr. Robert P. Walton, Professor of Pharmacology of the School
of Medicine of the University of Mississippi, has written a most
comprehensive book on the subject of marihuana, embodying in
detail pharmacological and social studies.(2) A chapter on the
&quot;Present Status of the Marihuana Vice in the United
States&quot; was prepared by Dr. Frank R. Gomila, Commissioner of
Public Safety of New Orleans, and C. G. Lambou, Assistant City
Chemist. They refer to New Orleans as being possibly the first
large city in the United States where the drug habit became
widely established among the native population, and they
therefore believe that the authorities in this city had a decided
opportunity to observe the progress of the smoking of marihuana
as a social problem. Referring specifically to the use of
marihuana among school children, they state that reporters in New
Orleans not only heard about but observed large numbers of boys
of school age actually buying and smoking marihuana cigarettes.
One peddler was so brazen as to keep his stock under the street
stairs to a girls' high school. </p>

<p>Inquiries further revealed that school children of forty-four
schools in New Orleans (only a few of these were high schools)
smoked marihuana. As a result of exposure and widespread
agitation, </p>

<p><b>(start quotation)</b> </p>

<p>Verifications came in by the hundreds from harassed parents,
teachers, neighborhood pastors, priests, welfare workers and club
women. Warrington House for boys was full of children who had
become habituated to the use of cannabis. The superintendent of
the Children's Bureau reported that there were many problem
children there who had come under the influence and two who had
run away because they couldn't get their &quot;muggles&quot; at
the Bureau. The Director of Kingsley House for boys received many
pleas from fathers of boys who had come under the influence and
were charged with petty crimes. </p>

<p>After personally seeing these boys in an hysterical condition
or on the well-known &quot;laughing jags,&quot; the director
termed the situation decidedly grave. The Waif's Home, at this
time, was reputedly full of children, both white and colored, who
had been brought in under the influence of the drug. Marihuana
cigarettes could be bought almost as readily as sandwiches. Their
cost was two for a quarter. The children solved the problem of
cost by pooling pennies among the members of a group and then
passing the cigarettes from one to another, all the puffs being
carefully counted.... </p>

<p>The result of these investigations ended in a wholesale arrest
of more than 150 persons. Approximately one hundred underworld
dives, soft-drink establishments, night clubs, grocery stores,
and private homes were searched in the police raid. Addicts,
hardened criminals, gangsters, women of the streets sailors of
all nationalities, bootleggers, boys and girls, -- many flashily
dressed in silks and furs, others in working clothes -- all were
rounded up in the net which Captain Smith and his squad had set. </p>

<p>. . . Notwithstanding the thoroughness with which this police
roundup was carried out, it did not entirely eradicate in one
stroke a vice which had already become so well established.
During the next few years New Orleans experienced a crime wave
which unquestionably was greatly aggravated by the influence of
this drug habit. Payroll and bank guards were doubled, but this
did not prevent some of the most spectacular holdups in the
history of the city. Youngsters known to be
&quot;muggle-heads&quot; fortified themselves with the narcotic
and proceeded to shoot down police, bank clerks and casual
bystanders. Mr. Eugene Stanley, at that time District Attorney,
declared that many of the crimes in New Orleans and the South
were thus committed by criminals who relied on the drug to give
them a false courage and freedom from restraint. Dr. George
Roeling, Coroner, reported that of 450 prisoners investigated,
125 were confirmed users of marihuana. Dr. W. B. Graham, State
Narcotic Officer, declared in 1936 that 60 per cent of the crimes
committed in New Orleans were by marihuana users.(3) </p>

<p><b>(end quote)<br>
</b></p>

<p>The Mayor's Committee on Marihuana decided to confine its
investigations to a limited area. For a number of reasons the
Borough of Manhattan seemed to be the most profitable section of
the city in which to concentrate. In order to crystallize our
particular project we deemed it advisable to direct our efforts
to finding answers to the following questions: </p>

<p>1. To what extent is marihuana used? </p>

<p>2. What is the method of retail distribution? </p>

<p>3. What is the general attitude of the marihuana smoker toward
society and toward the use of the drug? </p>

<p>4. What is the relationship between marihuana and eroticism? </p>

<p>5. What is the relationship between marihuana and crime? </p>

<p>6. What is the relationship between marihuana and juvenile
delinquency? <br>
</p>

<p>In the course of our investigations, we have made extensive
use of subjective data obtained from those who were actual
smokers of marihuana and directly acquainted with its effects and
those who were not smokers, but, because of residence, occupation
or other interests, were acquainted with the general subject.<br>

<h1><a name="OLE_LINK2">Organization of Staff</a></h1>

<hr>

<p>In October 1939 Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine
designated Deputy Chief Inspector Daniel Curtayne, Lieutenant
Edward Cooper, Sergeant Bernard Boylan and Detective Joseph
Loures of the Narcotic Squad of the Police Department of the City
of New York to cooperate with the Mayor's Committee on Marihuana.
These police officials submitted a list of intelligent young
officers with a suitable background. From this list six officers
were selected: two policewomen, and four policemen, one of whom
was a Negro. They were: Mr. James Coen, Mr. William Connolly, Mr.
Benjamin Weissner, Mr. John Hughes, Miss Adelaide Knowles and
Miss Olive Cregan. These police officers were encouraged to read
literature on the subject of marihuana and to familiarize
themselves with some of the characteristics of the plant, as well
as of marihuana cigarettes. They became expert in detecting the
aroma of burning marihuana, and were thus able to recognize it
and to identify its use in a social gathering. </p>

<p>Regular assignments were made by the director of the survey.
At intervals each officer dictated a general report on his
activities and findings to a stenographer engaged by the
Committee. Frequent conferences were held in the office of the
director of the survey, at which time individual reports were
discussed in detail and evaluated. </p>

<p>An attempt was made to give the &quot;marihuana squad&quot; a
psychological approach to the performance of their duties. At no
time were these officers permitted to make known their activity
to other members of the police force, or to make arrests. This
arrangement was considered essential in order that they might
maintain an effective role of investigator without being in any
respect recognized as police officers. Although they were members
of the police force and constantly in contact with violators of
law, their immediate superiors cooperated to an extreme degree by
allowing the &quot;marihuana squad&quot; to report directly to
the director of the survey. </p>

<p>While on duty the squad actually &quot;lived&quot; in the
environment in which marihuana smoking or peddling was suspected.
They frequented poolrooms, bars and grills, dime-a-dance halls,
other dance halls to which they took their own partners, theatres
-- backstage and in the audience -- roller-skating rinks,
subways, public toilets, parks and docks They consorted with the
habitues of these places, chance acquaintances on the street,
loiterers around schools, subways and bus terminals. They posed
as &quot;suckers&quot; from out of town and as students in
colleges and high schools. </p>

<p>We highly commend these officers individually for their
exceptionally good performances. The aid given by Deputy Chief
Inspector Daniel Curtayne, Lieutenant Edward Cooper, Sergeant
Bernard Boylan and Detective Joseph Loures throughout deserves
mention and appreciation. At times we must have been a source of
annoyance to them, but our requests were always cheerfully met
and assistance heartily extended.<br>
</p>

<p>Method of Retail Distribution </p>

<p>In general, marihuana is used in the form of a cigarette.
Occasionally some individuals chew the &quot;weed&quot; and seem
to get the same effect as do others through smoking. The common
names for the cigarettes are: muggles, reefers, Indian hemp,
weed, tea, gage and sticks. Cigarettes made of marihuana differ
in size as do cigarettes made of tobacco: they are long, short,
thick or thin. </p>

<p>The price varies in accordance with the accepted opinion as to
the potency of the marihuana used in the cigarettes, and this
appears to be determined by the place of origin. The cheapest
brand is known as &quot;sass-fras,&quot; and retails for
approximately three for 50 cents. It is made of the marihuana
that is grown in the United States. Smokers do not consider such
marihuana very potent. They have found that they must consume a
greater number of cigarettes in order to obtain the desired
effect colloquially termed as &quot;high.&quot; This opinion,
expressed by smokers in the Borough of Manhattan, is at variance
with that of some authorities who believe that marihuana grown in
the United States is as potent as the marihuana grown in other
countries. </p>

<p>The &quot;panatella&quot; cigarette, occasionally referred to
as &quot;meserole,&quot; is considered to be more potent than the
&quot;sass-fras&quot; and usually retails for approximately 25
cents each. The hemp from which the &quot;panatella&quot; is made
comes from Central and South America. </p>

<p>&quot;Gungeon&quot; is considered by the marihuana smoker as
the highest grade of marihuana. It retails for about one dollar
per cigarette. The &quot;kick&quot; resulting from the use of
this cigarette is reached more quickly than from the use of
&quot;sassafras&quot; or &quot;panatella.&quot; It appears to be
the consensus that the marihuana used to make the
&quot;gungeon&quot; comes from Africa. The sale of this cigarette
is restricted to a clientele whose economic status is of a higher
level than the majority of marihuana smokers. </p>

<p>A confirmed marihuana user can readily distinguish the quality
and potency of various brands, just as the habitual cigarette or
cigar smoker is able to differentiate between the qualities of
tobacco. Foreign-made cigarette paper is often used in order to
convince the buyer that the &quot;tea is right from the
boat.&quot; </p>

<p>There are two channels for the distribution of marihuana
cigarettes-- the independent peddler and the &quot;tea-pad.&quot;
From general observations, conversations with &quot;pad&quot;
owners, and discussions with peddlers, the investigators
estimated that there were about 500 &quot;tea-pads&quot; in
Harlem and at least 500 peddlers. </p>

<p>A &quot;tea-pad&quot; is a room or an apartment in which
people gather to smoke marihuana. The majority of such places are
located in the Harlem district. It is our impression that the
landlord, the agent, the superintendent or the janitor is aware
of the purposes for which the premises are rented. The
&quot;tea-pad&quot; is furnished according to the clientele it
expects to serve. Usually, each &quot;tea-pad&quot; has
comfortable furniture, a radio, victrola or, as in most
instances, a rented nickelodeon. The lighting is more or less
uniformly dim, with blue predominating. An incense is considered
part of the furnishings. The walls are frequently decorated with
pictures of nude subjects suggestive of perverted sexual
practices. The furnishings, as described, are believed to be
essential as a setting for those participating in smoking
marihuana. </p>

<p>Most &quot;tea-pads&quot; have their trade restricted to the
sale of marihuana. Some places did sell marihuana and whisky, and
a few places also served as houses of prostitution. Only one
&quot;teapad&quot; was found which served as a house of
prostitution, and in which one could buy marihuana, whisky, and
opium. </p>

<p>The marihuana smoker derives greater satisfaction if he is
smoking in the presence of others. His attitude in the
&quot;tea-pad&quot; is that of a relaxed individual, free from
the anxieties and cares of the realities of life. The
&quot;tea-pad&quot; takes on the atmosphere of a very congenial
social club. The smoker readily engages in conversation with
strangers, discussing freely his pleasant reactions to the drug
and philosophizing on subjects pertaining to life in a manner
which, at times, appears to be out of keeping with his
intellectual level. A constant observation was the extreme
willingness to share and puff on each other's cigarettes. A
boisterous, rowdy atmosphere did not prevail and on the rare
occasions when there appeared signs indicative of a belligerent
attitude on the part of a smoker, he was ejected or forced to
become more tolerant and quiescent. </p>

<p>One of the most interesting setups of a &quot;tea-pad,&quot;
which was clearly not along orthodox lines from the business
point of view, was a series of pup tents arranged on a roof-top
in Harlem. Those present proceeded to smoke their cigarettes in
the tents. When the desired effect of the drug had been obtained
they all merged into the open and engaged in a discussion of
their admiration of the stars and the beauties of nature. </p>

<p>Because of the possibility of spreading disease, note should
be taken of what seems to be a custom known as
&quot;pick-up&quot; smoking. It is an established practice
whereby a marihuana cigarette is lit and after one or two
inhalations is passed on to the next person. This procedure is
repeated until all present have had an opportunity to take a puff
or two on the cigarette. </p>

<p>Occasionally a &quot;tea-pad&quot; owner may have peddlers who
sell their wares in other localities and at the same time serve
as procurers for those who wish to smoke marihuana on the
premises. </p>

<p>One also finds other methods of retail distribution. After
proper introduction, one may be able to purchase the cigarette in
certain places. This is not an easy procedure, but it can be
accomplished. In some bar-and-grills, restaurants, and bars our
investigators were able to establish contact with someone who in
turn, would introduce them to a peddler who apparently made
regular rounds of these places in order to sell cigarettes. It
appears that the owners of such places are not aware of this
practice, and in many instances they would discharge any employee
known to be directly or indirectly associated with the sale of
marihuana. </p>

<p>On rare occasions public guides, if properly approached would
refer one to a place where the &quot;reefer&quot; could be
bought. There was no evidence that the guide received money when
acting as go- between. Terminal porters, mainly Negroes, appeared
to be more directly connected with the traffic of marihuana. They
were more conversant with the subject and it was easier for them
to establish contact between purchaser and peddler. </p>

<p>Marihuana smoking is very common in the theatres of Harlem
according to the observations of the investigators. We have
reason to believe that in some instances, perhaps few in number,
employees actually sold cigarettes on the premises. In the Harlem
dance halls smoking was frequently observed either in the
lavatories or on the main floor. The patrons as well as the
musicians were seen in the act of smoking. There was no evidence
of sales being made by employees on the premises, or that there
was any gain on the part of the owners or employees in permitting
this practice. Whereas the smoking of marihuana was not
encouraged, nothing was done to prohibit such practice. </p>

<p>There are specific sections in the Borough of Manhattan where
the sale of marihuana cigarettes appears to be localized: 1) the
Harlem district; 2) the Broadway area, a little east and west of
Broadway and extending from 42nd Street to S9th Street. While it
is true that one may buy the cigarette in other districts, it is
not as easily obtainable as in the two localities mentioned. <br>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>The Mental Attitude of the Marihuana Smoker Toward Society
and Marihuana</h1>

<hr>

<p>Most of the smokers of marihuana coming within the scope of
our survey were unemployed, and of the others most had part-time
employment. </p>

<p>Occasional, as well as confirmed, users were all aware of the
laws pertaining to the illegal use of the drug. They did not
indulge in its use with a spirit of braggadocio or as a challenge
to law as has been reported by some investigators in other
districts. They did not express remorse concerning their use of
marihuana, nor did they blame this habit as a causative factor in
the production of special difficulties in their personal lives.
Except for musicians there appeared to be no attempt at
secretiveness on the part of the habitual smoker. This attitude
is in marked contrast to that usually taken by those addicted to
morphine, cocaine, or heroin. </p>

<p>The consensus of marihuana users is that the drug is not
harmful and that infrequent or constant use of marihuana does not
result in physical or mental deterioration. </p>

<p>In describing the most common reaction to the drug they always
stated that it made them feel &quot;high.&quot; Elaboration of
just what the smoker meant by &quot;high&quot; varied with the
individual. However, there was common agreement that a feeling of
adequacy and efficiency was induced by the use of marihuana and
that current mental conflicts were allayed. Organic illness was
not given as a cause for smoking &quot;reefers.&quot; </p>

<p>A person may be a confirmed smoker for a prolonged period, and
give up the drug voluntarily without experiencing any craving for
it or exhibiting withdrawal symptoms. He may, at some time later
on, go back to its use. Others may remain infrequent users of the
cigarette, taking one or two a week, or only when the
&quot;social setting&quot; calls for participation. From time to
time we had one of our investigators associate with a marihuana
user. The investigator would bring up the subject of smoking.
This would invariably lead to the suggestion that they obtain
some marihuana cigarettes. They would seek a &quot;tea-pad,&quot;
and if it was closed the smoker and our investigator would calmly
resume their previous activity, such as the discussion of life in
general or the playing of pool. There were apparently no signs
indicative of frustration in the smoker at not being able to
gratify the desire for the drug. We consider this point highly
significant since it is so contrary to the experience of users of
other narcotics. A similar situation occurring in one addicted to
the use of morphine, cocaine, or heroin would result in a
compulsive attitude on the part of the addict to obtain the drug.
If unable to secure it, there would be obvious physical and
mental manifestations of frustration. This may be considered
presumptive evidence that there is no true addiction in the
medical sense associated with the use of marihuana. </p>

<p>The confirmed marihuana smoker consumes perhaps from six to
ten cigarettes per day. He appears to be quite conscious of the
quantity he requires to reach the effect called &quot;high.&quot;
Once the desired effect is obtained he cannot be persuaded to
consume more. </p>

<p>He knows when he has had enough. The smoker determines for
himself the point of being &quot;high,&quot; and is ever
conscious of preventing himself from becoming &quot;too
high.&quot; This fear of being &quot;too high&quot; must be
associated with some form of anxiety which causes the smoker,
should he accidentally reach that point, immediately to institute
measures so that he can &quot;come down.&quot; It has been found
that the use of such beverages as beer, or a sweet soda pop, is
an effective measure. Smokers insist that &quot;it does something
to the stomach&quot; and that it is always associated with
&quot;belching.&quot; A cold shower will also have the effect of
bringing the person &quot;down.&quot; </p>

<p>Smokers have repeatedly stated that the consumption of whisky
while smoking negates the potency of the drug. They find it is
very difficult to get &quot;high&quot; while drinking whisky, and
because of that smokers will not drink whisky while using the
&quot;weed.&quot; They do, however, consume large quantities of
sweet wines. It is their contention that this mild alcoholic
beverage aids the drug in producing the desired effect. Most
marihuana smokers insist that the appetite is increased as the
result of smoking. </p>

<p>We have been unable to confirm the opinion expressed by some
investigators that marihuana smoking is the first step in the use
of such drugs as cocaine, morphine, and heroin. The instances are
extremely rare where the habit of marihuana smoking is associated
with addiction to these other narcotics.<br>
</p>

<h2>Marihuana and Eroticism </h2>

<p>In the popular agitation against the use of marihuana, its
erotic effects have been stressed repeatedly. As previously
stated in this report, our investigators visited many
&quot;tea-pads&quot; in the Borough of Manhattan. It is true that
lewd pictures decorated the walls but they did not find that they
were attracting attention or comment among the clientele. In fact
one of the investigators who was concentrating his attention on
the relation between marihuana and eroticism stated in his report
that he found himself embarrassed in that he was the only one who
examined the pictures on the wall. </p>

<p>Numerous conversations with smokers of marihuana revealed only
occasional instances in which there was any relation between the
drug and eroticism. At one time one of our investigators attended
a very intimate social gathering in an apartment in Harlem,
having succeeded in securing the position of doorman for the
occasion. </p>

<p>There was a great deal of drinking, and the dancing was of the
most modern, abandoned, &quot;jitter-bug&quot; type. This form of
dancing is highly suggestive and appears to be associated with
erotic activity. The investigator made careful observation of
those who were dancing, and found that there was no difference
between the ones who were and the ones who were not smoking
&quot;reefers.&quot; Similar impressions were received after
careful observations in public dance halls, places where they
knew that some persons were under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>Visits to brothels which occasionally also served as
&quot;teapads&quot; revealed that the use of marihuana was not
linked to sexuality. These observations allow us to come to the
conclusion that in the main marihuana was not used for direct
sexual stimulation. <br>
</p>

<h2>Crime </h2>

<p>One of the most important causes of the widespread publicity
which marihuana smoking has received is the belief that this
practice is directly responsible for the commission of crimes. </p>

<p>During our investigation many law enforcement officers,
representing various federal, state and local police bureaus,
were interviewed and asked for a confidential expression of
opinion on the general question of crime and marihuana. In most
instances they unhesitatingly stated that there is no proof that
major crimes are associated with the practice of smoking
marihuana. They did state that many marihuana smokers are guilty
of petty crimes, but that the criminal career usually existed
prior to the time the individual smoked his first marihuana
cigarette. These officers further stated that a criminal
generally termed as a &quot;real&quot; or
&quot;professional&quot; criminal will not associate with
marihuana smokers. He considers such a person inferior and
unreliable and will not allow him to participate in the
commission of a major crime. </p>

<p>In the period beginning October 1939 and ending November 1940,
the Police Department made 167 arrests for the possession and use
of marihuana. Classified according to race they were: white, 33
men, 4 women; Latin-American, 26 men, 2 women; Negro, 83 men, 6
women; Latin-American (colored) 9 men, 1 woman- British East
Indies 1, Filipino 1, Chinese 1. Classified according to age, 12
per cent were between the ages of 16 and 20, 58 per cent between
the ages of 21 and 30, 24 per cent between the ages of 31 and 40,
and 6 per cent between the ages of 41 and 50. </p>

<p>During the period under discussion, the Police Department
confiscated approximately 3,000 pounds of marihuana. </p>

<p>The sale and use of marihuana is a problem engaging the
vigilance of the New York Police Department. However, the number
of officers available for such duty is limited. Officers
specifically assigned to the Narcotics Division of the Police
Department are acquainted with the problem, but the majority of
the officers are fundamentally without authoritative knowledge
regarding this subject. </p>

<p>The relation between marihuana smoking and the commission of
crimes of violence in the city of New York is described by Dr.
Walter Bromberg, psychiatrist-in-charge of the Psychiatric Clinic
of the Court of General Sessions, in an article published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association:<br>
</p>

<p>(start quotation) </p>

<p>In the south of this country (New Orleans) the incidence of
marihuana addicts among major criminals is admittedly high.
Sporadic reports from elsewhere in the country of murders and
assaults due to marihuana appear in the press frequently. It is
difficult to evaluate these statements, because of their
uncritical nature. The bulletin prepared by the Foreign Policy
Association lists ten cases &quot;culled at random from the files
of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics&quot; of murder and atrocious
assault in which marihuana was directly responsible for the
crime. </p>

<p>Among the ten patients, the second, J. O., was described as
having confessed how he murdered a friend and put his body in a
trunk while under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>J. O. was examined in this clinic; although he was a
psychopathic liar and possibly homosexual, there was no
indication in the examination or history of the use of any drug.
The investigation by the probation department failed to indicate
use of the drug marihuana. The deceased, however, was addicted to
heroin. </p>

<p>Our observations with respect to marihuana and crime were made
in the Court of General Sessions over a period of five and a half
years. The material in that court is limited as to residence to
New York County, although it must be remembered that the
offenders come from many sections of the country and are of many
racial types. This is important, because the British
investigators have noted in India that cannabis does not bring
out the motor excitement or hysterical symptoms in Anglo-Saxon
users that occur in natives. There are several other difficulties
in collecting reliable material, one being the complete
dependence on the history and statements of the prisoners without
an opportunity for objective tests or other corroborative check,
as in the case of other drugs, e.g., heroin or morphine. </p>

<p>During routine interviews of some 17,000 offenders in six and
a half years, several hundred have been found who had direct
experience with marihuana. Their testimony checks with
experimental results and clinical experiences with regard to the
symptoms of intoxication, the absence of true addiction, and the
negative connection with major crime. Especially is this
noteworthy among sexual offenders and in cases of assault or
murder. The extravagant claims of defense attorneys and the press
that crime is caused by addiction to marihuana demands careful
scrutiny, at least in this jurisdiction.... </p>

<p>Most of the narcotic cases in New York County are heard in the
Court of Special Sessions, where misdemeanants are handled and
where indictments on charges of the possession of drugs for use
are returned. In the Court of Special Sessions in the same
six-year period, of approximately 75,000 indictments for all
crimes, 6,000 resulted in convictions for the possession and use
of drugs. </p>

<p>Since neither the law, the district attorney nor the police
department makes any distinction between the several kinds of
narcotics in arraignments or indictments, there were no figures
from which to estimate the number of users of marihuana as
distinguished from the number of users of other drugs. A system
of sampling the 6,000 cases was therefore adopted in order to
furnish an approximate estimate of the total number of marihuana
users who came into conflict with the law. </p>

<p>In this sampling the records of 1,500 offenders, or 25 per
cent of the 6,000, were examined. Of these, 135 were charged in
connection with marihuana. From this fact it was estimated that
about 540 offenders, or 9 per cent of all drug offenders coming
to the Court of Special Sessions in six years, were users of
marihuana. In analyzing this sample of 135 cases, it was found
that 93 offenders had no previous record, the previous charges or
charges of 8 concerned only drugs, 5 had records including drug
charges and 29 had records not including drug charges. Among
those with longer records, that is, from four to seven previous
arrests, none showed progression from the use of drugs to other
crimes. </p>

<p>As measured by the succession of arrests and convictions in
the Court of General Sessions (the only method of estimation) it
can be said that drugs generally do not initiate criminal
careers. Similarly, in the Court of Special Sessions, only 8 per
cent of the offenders had previous charges of using drugs and 3.7
per cent had previous charges of drugs and other petty crimes. In
the vast majority of cases in this group of 135, then, the
earlier use of marihuana apparently did not predispose to crime,
even that of using other drugs. Whether the first offenders
charged with the use of marihuana go on to major crime is a
matter of speculation. The expectancy of major crimes following
the use of cannabis in New York County is small, according to
these experiences.(4) </p>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marijuana</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and School Children </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most serious accusations leveled against marihuana
by special feature writers has been that it is widely used by the
school children of this nation. These authors have claimed that
it has so detrimental an effect on development that it is a major
factor in juvenile delinquency. This phase of the marihuana
problem was deemed serious enough to merit primary consideration
in our study of the marihuana problem in New York City --
specifically in the Borough of Manhattan. We decided to attack
this aspect of the problem along the following lines: </p>

<ol>
    <li>To observe schools in order to see if pupils bought
        marihuana cigarettes from any peddlers operating in the
        neighborhood. </li>
    <li>To investigate thoroughly complaints made by parents to
        school and police authorities relative to marihuana and
        its use by school children. </li>
    <li>To interview principals, assistant principals, and
        teachers of many of the schools in New York City with
        reference to our project. </li>
    <li>To gather relevant statistics from various city bureaus
        and private agencies. </li>
</ol>

<p>Unknown to the school authorities, our investigators had under
surveillance many of the schools in the Borough of Manhattan.
They would observe a particular school for a number of
consecutive days, watch loiterers and suspicious characters in
the locality, and, under certain circumstances, follow some of
the children. This procedure was repeated at varying intervals in
different localities. From time to time the investigators would
return to some of the schools which they previously had kept
under surveillance. Attention was naturally concentrated upon
those schools from which emanated the most numerous complaints
and which were located in suspected neighborhoods. We must admit
that it would have been possible for such sales to have taken
place during the time that our investigators were not on duty,
but we came to the conclusion that there was no organized traffic
on the part of peddlers in selling marihuana cigarettes to the
children of the schools we observed. </p>

<p>Certain of the school authorities deserve special commendation
for their alertness in singling out suspicious characters
loitering in the vicinity of their schools. While investigating
one of the suspected schools, our investigators who were
loitering in the neighborhood were suspected and treated as
&quot;suspicious characters&quot; by the school authorities. </p>

<p>During the period of this survey the Police Department while
engaged in an entirely separate criminal investigation received a
lead indicating the sale of marihuana to children in a certain
high school. As a result, one pupil was arrested and convicted
for selling cigarettes to his classmates. </p>

<p>In the Harlem district we discovered a few places where school
children gathered during and after school hours for the purpose
of indulging in smoking ordinary cigarettes, drinking alcoholic
beverages, and engaging in homosexual and heterosexual
activities. </p>

<p>One of our investigators, having gained entrance to such a
place, ostentatiously displayed marihuana cigarettes which he had
with him. The madam of the place promptly cautioned him against
using the &quot;weed&quot; and insisted that at no time did she
permit any person to smoke it on her premises. </p>

<p>A surprising number of school children smoking ordinary
cigarettes were noted. A checkup revealed that these cigarettes
were being illicitly sold by men on the street and in candy
stores in the &quot;loose&quot; form. It is possible that this
trade in ordinary cigarettes is occasionally misinterpreted as
trade in &quot;reefers.&quot; </p>

<p>Interviews with school authorities were very significant, and
it is of value to summarize briefly some of the statements
actually made by them. The locations of the schools and the names
of the persons quoted are in our official files. </p>

<ol>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal stated,
        &quot;The school has never had any connection with
        marihuana, not even a rumor.&quot; </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal at first
        appeared to be evasive and did not readily volunteer
        information, but after repeatedly being pressed with the
        question stated that the school &quot;had not had any
        difficulty with the subject of marihuana.&quot; </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal
        emphatically stated, &quot;I have had no trouble with
        marihuana in my school.&quot; </li>
    <li>A vocational school in the Borough of Queens. Mixed.
        &quot;I have never heard the slightest thing about
        marihuana in connection with this school.&quot; </li>
    <li>High School. Queens. Mixed. &quot;We never had the
        slightest connection with marihuana in any way.&quot; </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Harlem. Predominantly Negro and
        Latin-American. The principal stated that there had been
        a few marihuana cases among the boys about eighteen
        months ago. His assistant volunteered the information
        that there had been some boys in the school who had
        &quot;reefers&quot; in their possession. On other
        occasions some of the boys appeared to be intoxicated and
        when examined confessed to having smoked
        &quot;reefers.&quot; He further stated, &quot;It was
        difficult to be sure if sleepy, perspiring,
        pallid-looking boys were feeling the effects of marihuana
        or were just recovering from too much 'partying' or
        drinking.&quot; He volunteered the opinion that since
        marihuana was an acute problem among the adult population
        in that particular district, it could be assumed that
        marihuana could occasionally become a problem in the
        school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White and Latin-American. On the
        fringe of Harlem. Principal and assistant principal
        stated that they have never had the slightest difficulty
        arising from marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White and Negro. Bordering on Harlem.
        The principal, because of his short tenure of office, was
        unable to express his opinion on the subject. The chief
        clerk stated that marihuana had never been a problem in
        the school. She was certain, however, that it was sold in
        the neighborhood. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White, with a high percentage of
        Negro and Latin-American. The principal stated, &quot;As
        yet we have had no contact with marihuana although,
        considering the neighborhood, it would not be
        unlikely.&quot; </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Latin-American, Negro, and some
        white. The principal stated, &quot;We have had no trouble
        with marihuana.&quot; He was of the opinion that because
        of the locality it would be possible for some older boys
        to smoke it without anybody being cognizant of it. He
        added that he would let us know if any boys were detected
        smoking. During the period of the survey no such report
        was made. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Latin-American predominating. The
        principal stated that she had not had any trouble with
        marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White predominating. The principal
        stated, &quot;I have had no contact with it.&quot;
        However, due to the location of the school, which was
        near Harlem, she stated she would notify the Juvenile Aid
        Bureau if such a problem arose. During the period of the
        survey no such report was received. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that no
        information concerning the use of any narcotics had ever
        come to his attention and was equally insistent that
        teachers would have reported any such information to him.
    </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that she
        had never found anything to indicate the use of any drug
        in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White and mixed. The principal stated
        that last year he had suspected that a group of chronic
        truants were using marihuana but he was unable to obtain
        any direct evidence. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal and his
        assistant stated that they had no real evidence of any
        marihuana problem in the school, and they do not believe
        that the drug is used to any extent. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that
        although she had no tangible evidence of marihuana
        smoking among the students, she has problem groups that
        gather in premises where she is inclined to think that
        marihuana could be obtained if they wished to get it. She
        is certain no marihuana is used in the school itself. We
        investigated thoroughly the suggestions made by the
        principal as to premises where marihuana might be sold
        but we were unable to gather any evidence of its sale. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The acting principal and a
        teacher in the school who had been there for a number of
        years stated that there had never been any evidence of
        the use of marihuana or any other drugs in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The health director of this
        school stated that any evidence concerning the use of
        narcotics by pupils would have been called to his
        attention, but none had been. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The authorities stated that
        there had been no traces of marihuana smoking. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The authorities stated that
        there had never been the slightest suggestion of
        marihuana smoking in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The assistant principal stated
        that he knew of no marihuana problem in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that
        because of the publicity given to marihuana smoking she
        had been on the alert to discover indications of its use
        in her school but had found no evidence of marihuana in
        the school or of anything that would lead her to believe
        that any one of her students used marihuana outside of
        the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that
        nothing pertaining to the use of narcotics had been
        reported to him in all the years he had been there. </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. Authorities, including
        the medical department, stated that no student had ever
        been reported for being under the influence of marihuana.
    </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal stated,
        &quot;There is no indication of a marihuana problem in
        the school.&quot; </li>
    <li>Grammar School. The principal stated that anonymous
        letters had been received from time to time from pupils
        in the school in reference to marihuana. One letter was
        actually signed by a pupil of the school, who reported
        the sale of marihuana in a candy store in the vicinity.
        The principal with held the name of the pupil but
        requested us to investigate the report. We kept this
        school, the immediate neighborhood, and all candy stores
        in the vicinity under strict surveillance, but were
        unable to gather any evidence which would indicate that
        the pupils of this school were obtaining marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Negro. Queens. The assistant
        principal stated that he had never heard anything about
        marihuana being a problem in his school. We had received
        a complaint about this school and one of our
        investigators had an informal chat with one of the
        teachers of this school who, because of her interest in
        the school children, appeared to be more conversant than
        anyone else with general problems at the school. She
        stated that she was certain marihuana was used by some of
        the students. She elaborated on the subject and recalled
        that a few months prior to the interview she had sent
        home five students (three Negroes and two Italians) whom
        she had noticed acting &quot;dopey&quot; in the classroom
        after the noon recess. She was not positive they were
        under the influence of marihuana but was fairly certain
        that they were under the influence of some drug. A
        student had told her that these boys used
        &quot;reefers&quot; and, noticing their stupor, she had
        concluded that they were under the influence of
        marihuana. Superficial examination showed her that their
        condition was not due to drinking whisky or any alcoholic
        beverage. In this school it was not necessary to notify
        the principal if a student was sent home. The teacher did
        so on her own account, arriving at a diagnosis without
        informing the principal of the condition. There was no
        doctor or nurse to examine the students. </li>
    <li>Grammar School. Negro. The principal and the social
        worker attached to this school stated that some time
        prior to the interview they had heard that cigarettes
        were being sold to children in Harlem. We were told of a
        certain man who was suspected of selling them to the
        children. The social worker was certain that a year
        before the interview marihuana cigarettes were sold on a
        certain street in Harlem to school children, but she had
        no knowledge as to whether the condition existed at the
        time of our investigation. While working on another part
        of the survey, we interviewed a young Negress,
        approximately 20 years of age, who was a marihuana
        smoker. She stated that she and another girl started to
        smoke marihuana cigarettes while attending this
        particular school. </li>
    <li>High School. Mixed, predominantly white. The principal
        stated that he was positive that there was no marihuana
        problem in his school. </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. A student was arrested
        for selling marihuana cigarettes to other pupils. We kept
        this school under surveillance after the arrest. Although
        we heard rumors that the sale of marihuana would start
        again, we were unable to gather any evidence of this. Our
        investigators attended the dance of the graduating class
        of this school at one of the hotels in the city. The
        dance was well conducted and had a large attendance.
        There was no evidence of smoking at this affair. The
        principal was cooperating with the Juvenile Aid Bureau of
        the Police Department in conducting the investigation of
        the marihuana problem in his school. </li>
    <li>High School. White and Negro. Although rumor is
        widespread that &quot;reefer&quot; smoking is common at
        this school, thorough investigation did not produce
        evidence of it at the time of our investigation. We did
        obtain information, which we consider authoritative, that
        in 1935 a man was offered the concession to sell
        marihuana cigarettes to the students of this school. He
        refused the offer. The principal of this school stated
        that there had never been any trouble as a result of
        marihuana smoking and he knew of no actual cases. </li>
    <li>High School. White, Negro, and Latin-American. The
        director of health education, who was conversant with the
        subject, stated that the school had no problem with
        regard to marihuana smoking on the premises but that a
        Puerto Rican student who lived in Harlem had informed him
        that he could obtain marihuana cigarettes in his
        locality. </li>
    <li>College. White, some Negroes and Latin-Americans. We did
        not interview the authorities. Observation of the be
        havior of and conversation with students did not reveal
        any marihuana problem. </li>
    <li>College. White, some Negroes and Latin-Americans. This
        college is located near one of the famous
        &quot;tea-pads&quot; of Harlem. Many of the students pass
        the house regularly. Continued observation did not reveal
        any student attendance. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Negro. Most of the boys of this
        school were familiar with the subject of marihuana. The
        pupils of the school are incessant smokers of ordinary
        cigarettes. We were unable to obtain any information
        which would indicate that they used &quot;reefers.&quot;
        Some students were observed entering a house in which
        there was a &quot;tea-pad,&quot; but we never found any
        of the occupants of this &quot;tea-pad&quot; to be pupils
        of the school. The counselor at the school stated that
        during the previous term there were suspicions regarding
        the use of marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Negro. The principal, who is
        considered qualified to discuss this subject, stated that
        for the three months prior to the interview there had
        been no marihuana problem. She ventured the opinion that
        a few cases do arise in the spring and summer.
        Observation of this school reveals that practically every
        day young boys between the ages of 18 and 20 loitered
        near the gates of the schoolyard at the close of the
        session. Some of these boys were known to our
        investigators as &quot;reefer&quot; smokers, and they
        associated with the girls of the school. Two young girls
        known by our investigators to be &quot;reefer&quot;
        smokers stated that they started to smoke marihuana while
        at that school. </li>
    <li>High School. White, many Negroes and Latin-Americans.
        Many students smoked ordinary tobacco cigarettes.
        Numerous complaints and rumors were associated with this
        school. The principal stated that in 1934 they had an
        acute marihuana problem but that at the present time they
        did not think it existed. They are constantly on guard,
        especially at the beginning of a term, because they get
        many new students from the Harlem district. We are of the
        opinion that there are definite signs indicating that
        there is some marihuana smoking in the school. </li>
    <li>High School. Negro and white. The principal of this
        school stated that they did not have a marihuana problem.
        We are certain, however, that this school does to some
        extent present an acute problem for we have observed a
        few students smoking &quot;reefers&quot; away from the
        school. We have reason to believe that some of them smoke
        it while at school. The girls attending this high school
        have a very low moral standard. </li>
</ol>

<p>On the basis of the above statements and findings, we feel
justified in concluding that although marihuana smoking may be
indulged in by small numbers of students in certain schools of
New York City, it is apparently not a widespread or largescale
practice. In the belief that actual facts concerning the role
played by marihuana in the production of juvenile delinquency
could best be revealed in the records of the Children's Court of
New York City, we interviewed the proper authorities on this
subject. On the basis of the Children's Court records for 1939,
marihuana is not an important factor in the development of
delinquency. </p>

<h1>The LaGuardia Report - Sociological Study </h1>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<hr>

<p>From the foregoing study the following conclusions are drawn: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Marihuana is used extensively in the Borough of Manhattan
        but the problem is not as acute as it is reported to be
        in other sections of the United States. </li>
    <li>The introduction of marihuana into this area is recent as
        compared to other localities. </li>
    <li>The cost of marihuana is low and therefore within the
        purchasing power of most persons. </li>
    <li>The distribution and use of marihuana is centered in
        Harlem. </li>
    <li>The majority of marihuana smokers are Negroes and
        Latin-Americans. </li>
    <li>The consensus among marihuana smokers is that the use of
        the drug creates a definite feeling of adequacy. </li>
    <li>The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to
        addiction in the medical sense of the word. </li>
    <li>The sale and distribution of marihuana is not under the
        control of any single organized group. </li>
    <li>The use of marihuana does not lead to morphine or heroin
        or cocaine addiction and no effort is made to create a
        market for these narcotics by stimulating the practice of
        marihuana smoking. </li>
    <li>Marihuana is not the determining factor in the commission
        of major crimes. </li>
    <li>Marihuana smoking is not widespread among school
        children. </li>
    <li>Juvenile delinquency is not associated with the practice
        of smoking marihuana. </li>
    <li>The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of
        marihuana smoking in New York City is unfounded. </li>
</ol>

<h1>The LaGuardia Report </h1>

<h1>THE CLINICAL STUDY</h1>

<h2>PLAN AND SCOPE</h2>

<hr>

<p>Interest in the effects of marihuana on the human subject
follows two main lines: first, concerning what may be called
pleasurable effects which account for its widespread use- and
second, regarding undesirable effects, including those leading to
criminal and other antisocial acts. </p>

<p>In his monograph on marihuana, Walton has reviewed at length
the literature on hashish experience. He has grouped these
descriptions as retrospective accounts by professional writers
and physicians who have taken the drug through curiosity or
scientific interest, reports by physicians concerning patients
who have taken excessive doses, and observations by psychiatrists
on subjects under marihuana influence. In all of these instances
a dose toxic to the individual had been taken and the effects
described correspond to psychotic episodes of greater or less
degree. </p>

<p>In the literature there are commonly described two basic types
of effect, one of excitation, psychic exaltation, and inner
joyousness, with divorcement from the external world; the other a
state of anxiety with fear of consequences, such as death or
insanity. Either one of these types of reaction may be
experienced alone, but usually both are present during the
intoxication. They occur in no regular sequence but replace each
other in rapid succession. The euphoric and anxiety states are
generally accompanied by mental confusion, a rapid flow of
dissociated ideas, and a feeling of prolongation of time and
spatial distortion. Sexual desires or phantasies may also occur. </p>

<p>The detailed descriptions of the experience vary. Those given
by trained writers, such as Ludlow and Bayard Taylor, are vivid
and dramatic, embodying sensual, visual, and auditory
illusions-phantasies of overpowering splendor and beauty, on the
one hand, and intense suffering and horror on the other. The
authors, familiar with stories of hashish effects and gifted with
strong imaginative powers, undoubtedly were expectant of much
that happened. The account given by the eminent Philadelphia
physician, H. C. Wood, while following the same general pattern,
has much less embellishment. He describes a feeling of well-being
and inner joyousness and buoyancy and the performance of antics
which he knew to be foolish but was unable to control. He was
able to recall no illusions or hallucinations. Later a state of
anxiety came on, developing into an overpowering fear of death. </p>

<p>A number of studies by psychiatrists on selected subjects have
been reported. An excellent example is that of Kant and Krapf.
Each acted as subject for the other and the effects of marihuana
are described and analyzed at length. In general, the objective
in such studies is the interpretation of the reactions in terms
of disturbances in psychological processes and functionings. The
descriptions referred to have been given by persons of a higher
social class, well educated and accustomed by training to act in
conformity with conventional social behavior. Although a state of
irritability may occur and threats of suicide be made by
individuals of this type under toxic doses of marihuana, it is
noteworthy that in none of the descriptions is there found an
expression of antagonism or antisocial behavior which led to acts
of violence or what would be called criminal conduct. </p>

<p>Of more direct interest are the publications of Walter
Bromberg, psychiatrist, Bellevue Hospital,
Psychiatrist-in-Charge, Psychiatric Clinic, Court of General
Sessions of New York County. Marihuana users who are brought
before the court or admitted to the hospital come under his
observation and he has reported at length on the psychiatric
observations of 29 of these who showed psychotic reactions. He
describes two types of reactions, one an acute marihuana
intoxication with a psychotic syndrome, the other a toxic
psychosis. Acute intoxication occurs in any individual if the
marihuana is taken in sufficiently large doses. It comes on
promptly and passes off some hours later. In marihuana psychosis,
the symptoms are much more severe and of longer duration. He
describes a number of cases in which the psychotic state
continued for a number of days and required hospitalization. </p>

<p>The toxic psychosis seen in marihuana users occurs at any time
and is of indefinite duration. Bromberg states that the
relationship between cannabis and the onset of a functional
psychotic state is not always clear. The personality factor is of
undoubted importance and other toxic agents, such as alcohol and
other drugs, as well as endogenous elements, may be involved. The
symptoms, except for the longer duration, resemble those observed
in persons under marihuana intoxication, but often take on the
characteristics seen in schizophrenic or manic- depressive
psychosis. </p>

<p>A description of 11 cases admitted to Bellevue Hospital is
given for illustration. The marihuana was taken in the form of
cigarettes. In this group were 5 Negroes, 2 of whom were women, 1
Puerto Rican, and 5 whites, one of whom was a Mexican and another
a boy of 16. Except for one of the whites, a homosexual, they
were all of a low intellectual and social order. One of the
Negroes was arrested for following women in Central Park. The
others were admitted at their own request, or were sent in by the
police or family. Three of the group had definite sexual
stimulation but in none was there an outburst in the form of an
attack on women. The Puerto Rican became confused and excited and
began chasing people with an ice pick. Shortly after his
discharge he was readmitted to the hospital, was diagnosed as
definitely psychotic, and was transferred to a state hospital as
a schizophrenic. The majority of the group, 8 in fact, had
psychopathic personalities and 3 of these were transferred to
state institutions for further care. The group as a whole is
representative of those who come into the hands of the police
because of abnormal conduct and who are the source of the
sensational newspaper and magazine stories. </p>

<p>Bromberg's findings concerning the lack of a positive
relationship between marihuana and crime are described in the
sociological section of this study. </p>

<p>In marihuana literature, the action of the drug is usually
described from retrospective observation of the effects on a
single individual. Relationship to varying dosage, to the
subject's personality and background, to environmental conditions
when the drug was taken, is given little if any attention. It is
the lack of information concerning these and other factors
involved in marihuana reaction which has given rise to the
present confusion regarding its effects. </p>

<p>The clinical study here described was designed to afford
information not found in marihuana literature but necessary for
any comprehensive view of marihuana action. For obtaining this
information there were these requisites: an adequate number of
subjects for the study, a clear understanding of the mental and
physical make-up of each subject, a uniformity of environmental
factors, accurately graded dosage of marihuana, and standardized
methods of obtaining and recording marihuana effects. In addition
to defining the usual and unusual effects of marihuana, as shown
by subjective and objective symptoms and alterations in behavior
and in physical reaction, the study was expected to answer
questions which must arise in consideration of the problem as a
whole. Of special importance are these: Do marihuana users show
fundamental traits differentiating them from non-users? Do users
present evidence of psychological or physical damage directly
attributable to the drug? What are the pleasurable effects which
account for the widespread usage of marihuana? To what extent
does it lead to antisocial or dangerous behavior? </p>

<p>The sections covering the clinical study are under the
following headings: </p>

<p><b>A. Medical Aspects</b> </p>

<p>1. Symptoms and Behavior </p>

<p>2. Organic and Systemic Functions </p>

<p><b>B. Psychological Aspects</b> </p>

<p>1. Psychophysical and Other Functions </p>

<p>2. Intellectual Functioning </p>

<p>3. Emotional Reactions and General Personality Structure </p>

<p>4. Family and Community Ideologies </p>

<p><b>C. Comparison Between Users and Non-Users from the
Standpoint of Mental and Physical Deterioration</b> </p>

<p><b>D. Addiction and Tolerance</b> </p>

<p><b>E. Possible Therapeutic Applications<br>
<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Organization for the Study<br>
</h2>

<p>The clinical studies were carried out at the Welfare Hospital
(1) a New York City hospital for chronic diseases on Welfare
Island. The quarters assigned to the study consisted of a ward of
eight beds for the group to be studied at any one period, an
adjoining ward of two beds for the study of individuals of the
group, three additional rooms with equipment for special
examinations, and a diet kitchen for the preparation of the
subjects' meals. </p>

<p>Four female nurses were employed and the subjects in the
larger ward were under constant supervision. In addition to
routine records, each nurse reported the behavior of the subjects
while she was on duty. Guards were assigned from the Department
of Correction and the New York City Police Force for the subjects
drawn from the Riker's and Hart Island penitentiaries and the
House of Detention for Women. </p>

<p>The facilities of the Third Medical Division laboratory were
used for general clinical laboratory examinations and for more
detailed study of organ functioning. For measurement of
psychological reactions, special apparatus was provided. A
description of equipment used for each division of the study is
given under its proper section. <br>

<h1>Subjects Selected for the Study</h1>

<hr>

<p>For the purpose of establishing a uniform plan of procedure to
be followed throughout the study, a test group of 5 individuals
who had had no previous experience with marihuana was selected.
These were volunteers who were paid for their services. They were
of a low socio-economic level, but classified as of better than
average intelligence. Only one of the group came within the range
of what is considered normal personality. They represented the
type of person who would readily take to marihuana were the
opportunity offered. </p>

<p>The main group, 72 subjects, was drawn from the inmates of the
penitentiaries at Riker's and Hart Islands and the House of
Detention for Women, all of which are under the supervision of
the Department of Correction of New York City. There were two
advantages in selecting subjects from this particular group;
first, they could be kept under continuous observation throughout
the period desired, and second, they constituted an excellent
sample of the class in New York City from which the marihuana
user comes. The subjects all volunteered for the study after
having its purpose and the part they were to take in it fully
explained to them. </p>

<h3>Race, Sex and Age.</h3>

<p>Of the group, 65 were males and 7 were females; 35 were white,
26 were Negroes, and 11 were Puerto Ricans. The ages ranged from
21 to 37 years except for one who was 45 and another who was 43.
Of the women, 6 had been opium addicts for a number of years. </p>

<h3>Previous Experience with Marihuana.</h3>

<p>Forty-eight of the group, including 6 of the women, gave a
history of marihuana smoking. The extent of the usage was
variable- for some it was occasional, while others had indulged
in the habit fairly steadily over a period of years. Of the 48
users, those who were sellers of marihuana were probably the most
consistent smokers, as in carrying on the traffic they would
endeavor to keep a stock on hand. But in any instance, the number
of cigarettes smoked during any stated period would vary
according to circumstance. Thus one user stated that he smoked
from 2 to 6 marihuana cigarettes a day, another from 10 to 15 a
day, another 3 or 4 a week, and another 5 or 6 a month. Those who
smoked daily are here classified as steady users, those who
smoked when opportunity was offered but not daily, as occasional
users.<br>
</p>

<p>(TABLE 1)<br>
</p>

<p>The users had all been deprived of marihuana from the time of
their arrest, the shortest period being two weeks, the longest,
one year and ten months. They all stated that the habit had often
been interrupted voluntarily and the enforced discontinuation of
it had caused no discomfort. </p>

<h3>Health Record.</h3>

<p>The subjects were individually selected by Dr. Allentuck as
suitable for the study. A physical and neurological examination
at the hospital showed no evidence of disease. However, the
Wassermann and Kline tests gave positive results for 6 subjects
and the Kline test alone was positive for 2 and doubtful for 2.
These figures are consistent with those of the population from
which the group was selected. Of the 12,000 inmates of the
Riker's Island Penitentiary in 1940 and the 8,000 in 1941, 10 per
cent reacted positively to serological tests. </p>

<h3>Intelligence Record.</h3>

<p>Sixty subjects (40 users and 20 nonusers ) to whom the
Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test was given had an average I.Q. of
99.3, range 70 to 124. The average I.Q. of the user group was
96.7, range 70 to 124, while that for the non-user group was
104.5, range 93 to 114. </p>

<p>When analyzed according to racial distribution, the two groups
were even better equated intellectually than the total results
indicate. Of the 28 white subjects examined, the average I.Q. of
the 13 users was 106.1, range 77 to 124, and that of the 15
non-users was 106.3, range 96 to 114. The 19 Negro users had an
average I.Q. of 92.6, range 70 to 112, and the 5 Negro non-users
averaged 98.8, range 93 to 101. Although in the colored group the
non-users averaged 6.2 points higher than the users, it must be
taken into account that the number of Negro non-users tested was
small. The average I.Q. of the 8 Puerto Rican users was 91.0,
range 72 to 100; that is, they were very similar in mental
ability to the Negro users. From the results obtained from the
Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test, one may conclude that neither
the users nor the nonusers were inferior in intelligence to the
general population.<br>
</p>

<h3>Marihuana Used<br>
</h3>

<p>The marihuana that was used for oral administration was
supplied by Dr. H. J. Wollner, Consulting Chemist of the United
States Treasury Department. It was in the form of an alcohol
fluid concentrate, the alcohol content ranging from 55 to 67.3
per cent and the content of solids from 22.9 to 33.6 Sm. per 100
cc. </p>

<p>According to the bio-assay made by Dr. S. Loewe of the
Department of Pharmacology of the Cornell University Medical
School, the strength of the fluid concentrate was found to be
from 71 to 90 per cent of that of the U.S.P. fluid extract for
cannabis marketed by Parke, Davis and Company. The fluid extract
was not miscible with water and had a characteristic,
disagreeable taste which made it easily recognized. For these
reasons the concentrate was evaporated to a viscid consistency
and made into pill form, with glycyrrhiza as the excipient. Each
pill was equivalent to 1 cc. of the concentrate. </p>

<p>For controls, glycyrrhiza pills without marihuana were used.
Several products prepared by Dr. Roger Adams in his investigation
of the chemistry of marihuana were used. A comparison of their
action with that of the concentrate will be found below. In
addition to the concentrate, marihuana cigarettes were used.
These were obtained from supplies confiscated by the New York
City Police. Each contained approximately from .4 to .8 gm. of
marihuana. As the quality of the marihuana varied and the amount
of active principles taken in with the smoke was unknown, there
was no exactness in dosage. In general, however, it appeared that
smoking 2 cigarettes was equivalent to taking 1 pill. </p>

<p>The minimal dose of the concentrate which produced clearcut
effects was 2 cc. During the repeated observations on each member
of the group larger doses were given, commonly up to around 8 cc.
and in one instance up to 22 cc. For smoking, from one to as many
as eleven cigarettes were used. </p>

<h3>The Active Principles.</h3>

<p>Determination of relative potencies of drugs having similar
action can be made on human beings to a limited extent only. The
comparison is based on easily measurable effects on some organ or
system on which the drug has a highly selective action, but the
existing state of the system influences greatly the ensuing
result. </p>

<p>Marihuana effects come mainly from action on the central
nervous system. The type and degree of response of this system to
stimuli of various origins vary in different individuals and in
the same individual at different times. When marihuana is given
the pre-existing state cannot be classified but it has influence
in determining the response, and the same dose of marihuana does
not produce identical effects in different subjects or in one
subject at different times. In general, however, when the dose
given is definitely effective the responses are of a fairly
uniform character. </p>

<p>For this reason the relative potency of the active principles
supplied by Dr. Roger Adams could be determined only
approximately. The principles used were the natural
tetrahydrocannabinol, the synthetic isomer, and the synthetic
hexylhydrocannabinol. These all brought on effects similar to
those of the marihuana concentrate. The estimate of their
relative potency is as follows: 1 cc. of the concentrate,
representing the extraction from 1 Gm, of marihuana, had as its
equivalent 15 mg. of the natural tetrahydrocannabinol, 60 mg. of
the synthetic hexylhydrocannabinol, and 120 mg. of the synthetic
tetra compound. In explaining the differences in the estimated
potencies, the rates of absorption must be taken into account
since the action of marihuana depends on the amount of active
principle absorbed and its concentration in the brain at a
certain time. </p>

<p>The main conclusion is that the action of the marihuana
concentrate is dependent on its tetrahydrocannabinol content and
that the synthetic compounds retain the action of the natural
principle. </p>

<h3>Procedure<br>
</h3>

<p>The procedure for examining the main group of subjects was
adopted in the light of the experience gained from the
preliminary study. </p>

<p>The subjects were brought to the hospital in groups of from
six to ten, and they stayed there from four to six weeks. Each
subject had his history taken and was given a physical
neurological, and psychiatric examination on the day of
admission. </p>

<p>Since it has been shown that pulse variation is the most
constant index of marihuana action, the pulse rate was recorded
every half hour during the day with the subjects at rest for five
minutes before each reading. </p>

<p>During the following days, through careful observation by the
Director, the general make-up of the subject, his personality,
the character of his responsiveness, and his behavior in new
surroundings were determined both before and while he was under
the influence of marihuana. Additional information came through
the nurses' reports. </p>

<p>In addition, each subject was given a series of tests before
and after the administration of marihuana in order that the
changes brought about by the drug might be measured. Included
among these tests were psychological tests for mental functioning
and emotional reactions, psychomotor tests for both simple and
complex psychophysical functions, tests to determine such
abilities as musical aptitude and the perception of time and
space, and laboratory examinations to test the functioning of the
various organs and systems of the body.<br>

<p><b>LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<p><b>Medical Aspects</b> </p>

<h1>SYMPTOMS AND BEHAVIOR</h1>

<p><b>Samuel Allentuck, MD</b> </p>

<hr>

<p><b>IN PRELIMINARY GROUP</b> </p>

<p>The preliminary study of the 5 volunteer subjects had for its
purpose the establishment of methods of procedures to be followed
for the main group, and the obtaining of a general picture of the
physical and mental effects induced by the drug. Having no
knowledge of the safe limits of marihuana dosage, the dosage
given to this group was restricted to from 1 to 4 cc. of the
concentrate, and for smoking from 1 to 3 cigarettes. </p>

<p>When ingested, 1 cc. of marihuana was slightly effective, the
multiples of this more so. There was noted in all subjects some
increase in pulse rate and in blood pressure, dilated and
sluggish pupils, dryness of the mouth and throat, ataxia, and
some clumsiness and incoordination of movement. Symptoms
distinctly disagreeable were dizziness in 3 subjects, a sense of
heaviness of the extremities in 2, nausea in 2 and faintness in
2. Three showed motor restlessness. A state classed as euphoria,
characterized by laughter, witticisms, loquaciousness, and
lowering of inhibitions occurred in 3 subjects. This was not
sustained but alternated with periods during which disagreeable
symptoms were dominant. In one of the subjects (V.C.) there was
no euphoric state, but a feeling of discomfort and depression
throughout. Finally in one of the 5 (A.V.) with 2 cc. There was a
state of depression with anxiety and with 4 cc. a psychotic
episode with fear of death. </p>

<p>With the exception of the one individual during his psychotic
episode, the subjects gave no evidence of abnormal mental content
at any stage of the drug action, the only change noted being a
delay in focusing attention on questions asked and difficulty in
sustaining mental concentration. While there was objection at
times to carrying out repetitious tests, there was no definite
refusal. There was no sexual stimulation giving rise to overt
expression. </p>

<p>With the cigarette smoking, ataxia and charges in the pulse
rate, blood pressure, and pupils corresponded to those following
oral administration. In only one of the subjects, however, was
there definite euphoria. The common symptoms were dizziness and
drowsiness. Two of the subjects found it difficult to
concentrate. </p>

<p>The duration of the effects of marihuana was variable. When it
was ingested, the effects usually passed off in from two to four
hours, but in one instance persisted for seven hours and in
another for fourteen hours. After smoking, the duration of
effects was from one to three hours. </p>

<p><b>IN MAIN GROUP</b> </p>

<p>The evidence of the effects of marihuana was obtained by the
subject's statement of symptoms and sensations, by the nurses'
reports and by the examiner's observations and interpretation of
changes in the subject's mental state and behavior. </p>

<p>The dosage of the marihuana concentrate ranged from 2 to 22
cc. and in each subject the effects of more than one dose were
studied. Dosage ranging from 2 to 5 cc. was used for the largest
number of subjects, and that from 14 to 21 cc. on only seven
occasions. It is known that marihuana intoxication may bring
about a comatose state, but no attempt was made to determine the
dosage required for this. The number receiving each of the
selected doses is shown in Table 2. </p>

<p>(TABLE 2) </p>

<p>While the duration of action and its intensity tended to
increase with dosage, this was not always the case and equal
doses did not bring about uniform effects in all those receiving
them. Thus, 3 cc. produced a striking effect in one individual,
much less in another in still another, 10 cc. produced less
effect than S cc. Such variations are to be explained by
differences in the mental make-up of the subject, and the
particular state of his responsiveness at the time when marihuana
is taken. </p>

<p>The number of cigarettes smoked ranged from one to eleven. The
smoking of a single cigarette took about ten minutes and up to
eight could be smoked in an hour. In smoking, increasing the
number of cigarettes usually increased the sensation described as
&quot;high,&quot; but here also there was no uniformity in
individuals or groups. </p>

<p>When marihuana was ingested, in dosages from 2 cc. up, its
actions became evident in from one half to one hour. The maximum
effects were seen in from two to three hours. These subsided
gradually, but the time of disappearance was variable, usually
three to five hours, in some instances twelve hours or more. </p>

<p>When marihuana cigarettes were used the effects appeared
almost immediately. After one cigarette, these had usually
disappeared in an hour. After several cigarettes had been smoked
the effects increased progressively in intensity and reached a
maximum in about an hour. In most instances they disappeared in
from three or four hours. </p>

<p><b>The Concentrate</b> </p>

<p><u>Behavior Symptoms.</u> </p>

<p>The effects on the general behavior of the subjects taking the
concentrate were variable. If left undisturbed some remained
quietly sitting or lying, showing little interest in their
surroundings. Others were restless and talkative. Under the
heading &quot;Euphoria&quot; there are listed those marihuana
effects which give rise to pleasurable sensations or experiences.
These are a sense of well-being and contentment cheerfulness and
gaiety, talkativeness, bursts of singing and dancing,
daydreaming, a pleasant drowsiness, joking, and performing
amusing antics. The drowsiness, daydreaming and unawareness of
surroundings were present when the subject was left alone. Other
euphoric expressions required an audience and there was much
contagiousness of laughing and joking where several of the
subjects under marihuana were congregated. The occurrence of a
euphoric state, in one or another form, was noted in most of the
subjects. But except for those who were allowed to pass the time
undisturbed, the pleasurable effects were interrupted from time
to time by disagreeable sensations. </p>

<p>Quite commonly seen, as with the preliminary group, was a
difficulty in focusing and sustaining mental concentration. Thus,
there would occur a delay in the subject's answers to questions
and at times some confusion as to their meaning. There was,
however, except in a few isolated instances, no abnormal mental
content evident and the responses brought out by the examiner
were not different from those in the pre-marihuana state. </p>

<p>Altered mental behavior which would give rise to more concern
was seen in a relatively small number of subjects. In some this
took the form of irritation at questioning, refusal to comply
with simple requests and antagonism to certain of the examiners.
There was, however, only verbal and no active opposition in any
of these behaviors, caused by the subject's desire to be left
undisturbed and his disinclination to carry out certain tests
which in his pre-marihuana period he had considered tiresome and
meaningless. With this came antipathy to those conducting the
tests. </p>

<p>The occurrence of the disagreeable physical symptoms
accompanying marihuana action would naturally lead to a feeling
of disquietude and some alarm as to significance and
consequences. </p>

<p>This, however, was a prominent feature in relatively few
instances. A pronounced state of anxiety reaching a panic stage,
associated usually with fear of death or of insanity, was
observed only in those subjects experiencing psychotic episodes
and here the anxiety state led to pleas for escape and not to
acts of aggression. Even in the psychotic states there were no
uncontrollable outbursts of rage or acts of violence. </p>

<p>Some evidence of eroticism was reported in about 10 per cent
of the 150 instances in which marihuana was administered to the
group. The presence of nurses, attendants and other women
associated with the study gave opportunity for frank expression
of sexual stimulation, had this been marked. There was no such
expression even during the psychotic episodes. </p>

<p>In some isolated instances there was evidence of marked
lowering of inhibitions such as loud discharge of flatus,
urinating on the floor instead of in the vessels supplied, and in
one instance frank exhibitionism. In the last instance the
subject, who was not a regular marihuana user, had been arrested
on three occasions for indecent exposure. </p>

<p>The frequency with which significant changes in behavior
occurred is indicated in Table 3 </p>

<p>(TABLE. 3) </p>

<p>As used in Table 3, anxiety means the subject's expressed
worry concerning what might happen to him. Excitement, shown by
physical restlessness, muscular twitchings and jerky movements,
and loud talking, and some degree of antagonism are known to be
expressions of an &quot;alarm&quot; or &quot;fear&quot; state. </p>

<p>It is seen from this table that, except for euphoria, the
effect of marihuana was definitely more pronounced on the
nonusers. This might be taken as evidence of a persisting
tolerance to the drug in the user group, but, on the other hand,
it may have as its basis a feeling of greater apprehension in the
nonusers. Such a feeling would undoubtedly arise among those who
have had no previous experience with marihuana and are in a state
of uncertainty as to its possible harmful effects. </p>

<p><u>Physical Symptoms.</u> </p>

<p>Of the subjective symptoms, a feeling described as lightness,
heaviness, or pressure in the head, often with dizziness, was one
of the earliest and occurred in practically all subjects,
irrespective of dose. Dryness of the mouth and throat were
reported by over half of the subjects as was also a floating
sensation. Unsteadiness in movement and a feeling of heaviness in
the extremities were commonly experienced as was a feeling of
hunger and a desire for sweets especially. Less commonly noted
were nausea, vomiting, sensations of warmth of the head or body,
burning of the eyes and blurring of vision, tightness of the
chest, cardiac palpitation, ringing or pressure in the ears, and
an urge to urinate or defecate. </p>

<p>From observation by the examiner, tremor and ataxia were
present in varying degrees in practically all instances and in
all dosages used, as were also dilatation of the pupils and
sluggish response to light. </p>

<p>These effects were often present on the day following
marihuana administration. </p>

<p>The frequency of the more common subjective symptoms and their
relation to dosage is shown in Table 4. The figures are taken
from the subject's reports. </p>

<p>There is a tendency for the symptoms to be more frequent in
the non-users than in the users but the differences are variable
and in general not striking.</p>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>The Marihuana Cigarette </h1>

<p><b>(Look for the Jack Benny Jello Hour)</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u>The Cigarette</u></b> </p>

<p>Smoking. When marihuana is smoked, there is, as has been
stated, no such accuracy in dosage as is the case when it is
ingested. The marihuana user acquires a technique or art in
smoking &quot;reefers.&quot; This involves special preparation of
the cigarette and regulation of the frequency and depth of
inhalations. In a group of smokers, a cigarette circulates from
one to another, each in turn taking one or more puffs. The
performance is a slow and deliberate one and the cigarette, held
in a forked match stick, is smoked to its end. </p>

<p>When the smoke comes in contact with the respiratory mucous
membrane, the absorption of the active principle is rapid and the
effects are recognized promptly by the subject. He soon learns to
distinguish the amount of smoking which will give pleasant
effects from the amount which will give unpleasant ones and so
regulates his dosages. Providing there are no disturbing factors,
as is the case in gatherings of small friendly groups or parties
in &quot;tea-pads,&quot; the regulated smoking produces a
euphoric state, which accounts for continued indulgence.<br>
</p>

<p>(TABLE 4)<br>
</p>

<p>The effect from smoking marihuana cigarettes was studied in 32
subjects. Of these, 20 were classed as users, that is, prior to
their arrest they had had more or less extensive experience in
smoking. In the study the smoking was repeated by each subject
several times, the number of cigarettes smoked within an hour
ranging from one to eight. </p>

<p>In all of the user group the smoking produced a euphoric state
with its feeling of well- being, contentment, sociability, mental
and physical relaxation, which usually ended in a feeling of
drowsiness. Talkativeness and laughing and the sensation of
floating in the air were common occurrences. These effects were
of short duration, from one to three or four hours after the
smoking was concluded. In none of these subjects was there an
expression of antagonism or antisocial behavior. </p>

<p>In the non-user group the effects were similar except that in
one subject a state of mental confusion occurred and in another
the main effect was a feeling of dizziness, unsteadiness, and
muscular weakness. Finally one subject showed effects entirely
different from the others. He smoked one cigarette and became
restless, agitated, dizzy, fearful of his surroundings, afraid of
death. He had three short attacks of unconsciousness. At one
period he had visions of angels, and for a few minutes a euphoric
state. The entire episode lasted a little over an hour, after
which he went to sleep. This subject had a similar psychotic
episode after taking 120 mg. of tetrahydrocannabinol. On seven
other occasions he had been given the marihuana concentrate or
tetrahydrocannabinol with no unusual effects. </p>

<p>Of the physical symptoms occurring with smoking, dryness of
the mouth and throat, dizziness, and a sensation of hunger were
the most common. None of these or other symptoms seemed to lessen
materially the pleasurable effects. </p>

<p>The effect of smoking on the 7 females, 6 of whom were classed
as users, corresponded to that on the male group. All showed
euphoric effects. One of the subjects was nauseated and another
was restless, irritable, and contrary. These effects were
observed in both of the subjects when marihuana was taken by
stomach. One of the users, euphoric after smoking 6 and 10
cigarettes, had a psychotic episode after 8 cc. of marihuana
concentrate. </p>

<p>Tea-Pad Parties. (This section on &quot;Tea-Pad Parties&quot;
was prepared by Mrs. Halpern.) In addition to the quantitative
data regularly obtained from the subject during the course of the
testing program, the examiner had opportunity to make diverse
observations of the subject's global reactions, which threw
interesting light on the general effect of the drug on the
individual personality. </p>

<p>When the subject became &quot;high,&quot; his inclination was
to laugh, talk, sing, listen to music, or sleep, but the
requirement that he solve problems, answer questions, or remember
drawings created an artificial situation, tending to bring him
&quot;down&quot; and spoil his pleasure. In order, therefore,
that the influence of the drug might be observed in less formal
circumstances and in a set-up more nearly like the customary
&quot;tea-pad,&quot; two groups of men were given
&quot;parties&quot; on the last night of their hospital sojourn.
The men were consulted beforehand, and the stage was set
according to their desires. They requested that nothing be done
until it was really dark outside. They brought the radio into the
room where the smoking took place and turned it to soft dance
music. Only one shaded light burned, leaving the greater part of
the room shadowy. The suggestion was made that easy chairs or
floor cushions be procured but the party progressed without
these. </p>

<p>The men were allowed as many cigarettes as they wanted. When
the &quot;reefers&quot; were passed out they crowded around with
their hands outstretched like little children begging for candy.
The number of cigarettes the men smoked varied, the range being
from two to twelve or thirteen. There were both users and
non-users in these two groups. The users of course were highly
elated at the prospect of getting much free &quot;tea,&quot; and
some of the non-users also smoked with genuine enjoyment. </p>

<p>In the beginning the men broke up into little groups of twos
and threes to do their smoking, or in some instances went off by
themselves. Smoke soon filled the atmosphere and added to the
general shadowy effect. After the initial smoking there was some
moving about- some men laughed and joked, some became
argumentative, while some just stared out of the window. The
arguments never seemed to get anywhere, although they often dealt
with important problems, and the illogical reasoning used was
never recognized or refuted by the person to whom it was
addressed. Gradually, as though attracted by some force, all
restlessness and activity ceased, and the men sat in a circle
about the radio. </p>

<p>Occasionally they whispered to one another, laughed a little,
or swayed to the music, but in general they relaxed quietly in
their chairs. A feeling of contentment seemed to pervade, and
when one man suddenly got a &quot;laughing jag&quot; they were
annoyed at the interruption. </p>

<p>In general, they gave the impression of adolescent boys doing
something which was forbidden and thereby adding spice to the
indulgence. Many of the adolescent personality patterns as they
appear in group activities were clearly observable here. There
was the eternal &quot;wisecracker,&quot; the domineering
&quot;important&quot; individual who tried to tell everyone what
to do, the silly, giggling adolescent and the shy, withdrawn
introvert. One forgot that these were actually adults with all
the usual adult responsibilities. One could not help drawing the
conclusion that they too had forgotten this for the time being. </p>

<p>Although urged to smoke more, no subject could be persuaded to
take more than he knew or felt he could handle. After about an
hour and half of smoking, the men were given coffee and bread and
jam and the party broke up. They all went to bed and reported the
next day that they had slept very well. </p>

<p>Another attempt at evaluating the effect of marihuana in less
formal situations was made in the following manner. The examiner,
one of the police officers and the subjects listened to Jack
Benny on the Jello Program at 7 o'clock Sunday evening. The
police officer noted the number of times the audience laughed,
and the length of time the laughter lasted. The examiner checked
these items for the subjects. The first time this was done
without marihuana; the following week the subjects were given
several &quot;reefers&quot; about fifteen minutes before the
radio program started. The results were as follows: </p>

<p>Without drug, the subjects laughed 42 times as against 72
laughs in the radio audience. The total time for all laughs was
63 seconds as compared with 139 seconds for the radio audience.
With cigarettes the subjects laughed 43 times as compared with 47
laughs in the audience, the total laugh time being 129 seconds as
compared with 173 seconds of laughter in the audience. Without
drug, the subjects laughed, roughly speaking, only half as often
and as long as the audience- while under the drug they laughed
almost as often and the laugh time was about 75 per cent that of
the audience. </p>

<p>It is obvious that under marihuana the subject laughs more
readily and for longer time intervals. This is probably due both
to the fact that things seem funnier to him and because when
under the influence of the drug he is less inhibited.<br>
</p>

<p><b><u>Differences Between Concentrate and Cigarette</u></b> </p>

<p>When marihuana was ingested, it was in the form of the
concentrate, containing all the active principles which are
soluble in the medium used. The relative proportions of the
principles present are unknown, and the effects can be assumed to
give a composite picture of different actions, the dominating one
being that of tetrahydrocannabinol. There is no information
available concerning the principles present in marihuana smoke,
and it is possible that some of those found in the concentrate
have been destroyed by the heat of combustion. The effects from
smoking correspond to those induced by tetrahydrocannabinol taken
by stomach, so it may be assumed that this principle is present
in the smoke. The rapidity with which effects occur after smoking
demonstrates the quick absorption of the cannabinol from the
respiratory tract and the short duration of these effects
indicates its prompt excretion or detoxification. When the
concentrate is taken, the absorption from the intestinal tract is
slower and more prolonged. For these reasons it is not possible
to make a precise comparison between the effects of the two forms
of administration. </p>

<p>In general the subject's consciousness of unpleasant symptoms
is more marked when the concentrate is taken and this may
interrupt or obscure the pleasant effects. The long duration of
action and the inability of the subject to stop it serve to
accentuate the physical symptoms and to cause apprehension
concerning what may happen. </p>

<p>The result of all this readily accounts for the irritability,
negativism and antagonism occurring. The lessening of inhibitions
is not peculiar to marihuana, for in a few subjects who were
given alcohol in intoxicating doses the behavior corresponded to
that induced by marihuana. </p>

<p>After smoking the main effect was of a euphoric type. Some
dizziness and dryness of the mouth were generally present but
were not pronounced enough to distract from the pleasant
sensations. The condition described as &quot;high&quot; came on
promptly and increased with the number of cigarettes smoked, but
it was not alarming or definitely disagreeable, and did not give
rise to antisocial behavior. </p>

<p>On the contrary it prompted sociability. The marihuana was
under the subject's control, and once the euphoric state was
present, which might come from only one cigarette, he had no
inclination to increase it by more smoking. When a considerable
number of cigarettes were smoked, the effect was usually one of
drowsiness and fatigue. </p>

<p>The description of the &quot;tea-pad parties&quot; brings out
clearly the convivial effect on the groups and the absence of any
rough or antagonistic behavior.<br>

<h1>Psychotic Episodes</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Psychotic Episodes</h2>

<p>What has been referred to as psychotic episodes occurred in 9
subjects, 7 men and 2 women. A description of the happenings in
each instance is given. (2) </p>

<p>(2) Throughout this section fictitious initials are used to
avoid any disclosure of the subjects' identities. </p>

<p>A.V. Male. Non-user. Given 4 cc. of marihuana concentrate.
About three hours later he became restless, tremulous, agitated,
fearful of harmful effects, suspicious of examiners. For short
periods he was euphoric. At one time he had visual hallucinations
of figures making gestures suggesting harm. He talked
continuously, mainly expressing fear. His answers to questions
were delayed but intelligent. </p>

<p>W.P. Male. Occasional user. Given 3 cc., repeated two hours
later. At first there was a euphoric state; later he became
resistant and negativistic. He showed antagonism to the examiner,
demanding to be left alone. He vomited twice. Throughout he was
highly excited and talked to himself. The effects in general
resembled those seen in a maniacal state. He returned to his
normal state in about three hours after the second dose. </p>

<p>F.D. Male. Occasional user. Given 4 cc. Five hours later he
became confused, disoriented and slow in answering questions.
There were periods of elation and depression with laughter and
weeping. The effects passed off in six hours. </p>

<p>R.W. Male. Non-user. Given 5 cc. Three hours later he became
disoriented with continued talkativeness and rapid shifting of
thought. He had fits of laughter and weeping, grandiose ideas,
some paranoid trends. He answered questions clearly but without
perseveration. He returned to normal after six hours. </p>

<p>I.N. Female. Occasional user. Also heroin addict for many
years. Given 8 cc. Three hours later she became confused and
anxious with periods of laughing and weeping. There were several
short episodes resembling hysterical attacks and dyspnea, pallor
and rapid pulse during which she felt that she was dying and
screamed for the doctor and for a priest. Throughout, her
response to questioning was intelligent but delayed. There was a
return to her normal state in three hours. </p>

<p>E.C. Male. Non-user. Given 6 cc. Two hours later he developed
a marked state of anxiety accompanied by a sensation of
difficulty in breathing. This began during a basal metabolism
test. In the Sanborn equipment used there is a nose clip
occluding nasal breathing and a rubber mouthpiece through which
the air is inspired and expired. During the test the subject
became confused, panicky and disoriented as to time. The anxiety
over breathing continued for four hours but could be interrupted
by distraction. He was then given 4 cc. more. The breathing
difficulty lasted five hours more. The condition here had
features seen in claustrophobia. Before the episode, the subject
had taken marihuana on five occasions in 2, 4, 5, 5, and 2 cc.
dosage, without any symptoms of respiratory distress. However,
after the episode he took marihuana on three occasions in 2, 5,
and 6 cc. dosage and each time the respiratory symptoms occurred.
A certain degree of nervousness was present but there was no
mental confusion. The subject realized that there was no physical
obstruction to his breathing and had learned that by
concentrating his thought on other lines he could keep his
respiratory difficulties in abeyance and would not suffer from
real anxiety. Smoking up to as many as thirteen marihuana
cigarettes did not bring about the respiratory effect. It
appeared then that the respiratory symptoms were precipitated by
the wearing of the apparatus while under the influence of
marihuana, and through suggestibility there resulted a
conditioning to the marihuana concentrate which was given
subsequently. </p>

<p>The description of these six psychotic episodes fits in with
many others found in marihuana literature. They are examples of
acute marihuana intoxication in susceptible individuals which
comes on shortly after the drug has been taken and persists for
several hours. </p>

<p>The main features of the poisoning are the restlessness and
mental excitement of a delirious nature with intermittent periods
of euphoric and an overhanging state of anxiety and dread. </p>

<p>Three other subjects presented the features of marihuana
psychosis. </p>

<p>R.H. Male. White. Age 23. Non-user. In prison for the offense
of living on prostitution. The family history was bad. His father
never supported his wife or family and there was continual
discord at home. When the subject was 9 years old the father
deserted the family. Three brothers received court sentences, one
for stealing a taxi, one for rape, and one for striking a
teacher. R.H. was a problem child at school and on account of
truancy and waywardness he was sent to the Flushing Parental
School. </p>

<p>He ran away from this school several times and was transferred
to the House of Refuge on Randall's Island. At the age of 16 he
was discharged. Since that time he had had two jobs, one for
three months in a factory, the other for four and one-half months
in the W.P.A. When he was 16 he was run over by a truck and was
unconscious for a time. After his return to the Riker's Island
Penitentiary from Welfare Hospital further questioning concerning
his past revealed that he was subject to &quot;fits&quot;
occurring once or twice every two months. During the attacks his
body became rigid and his mouth felt stiff. </p>

<p>The subject was admitted to Welfare Hospital for the marihuana
study on February 20th. After the usual program of examinations
he was given 2 cc. of the concentrate on February 27th and
February 28th. These doses brought on the symptoms of dizziness
and tremor and heaviness of the head and the state called
&quot;high&quot; which is characterized by periods of laughter
and talkativeness. These effects passed off in a few hours and
were followed by drowsiness and a sense of fatigue. On March 1st
at 1 p.m. he smoked one marihuana cigarette. Immediately
afterwards he became agitated and restless and suddenly lost
consciousness. He recovered quickly and stated that he had had
visions of angels and had heard choirs singing. Later he had a
second short period of unconsciousness. During the afternoon he
continued to be agitated and restless and had periods of laughing
and weeping. After he was given phenobarbital he went to sleep.
On the next day his only complaint was that he felt dizzy.
Following this episode he was given 4 cc. Of marihuana
concentrate on March 3rd and 2 cc. on March 10th and 2 cc. of
tetrahydrocannabinol on March 5th and 4 cc. on March 8th. The
effects corresponded to those seen after the earlier
administrations of 2 cc. doses of the concentrate. </p>

<p>On March 11th R.H. was given 5 cc. (75 mg.) of the
tetrahydrocannabinol at 11 a.m. and 3 cc. at 2 p.m. No unusual
effects were noted during the afternoon and he ate his supper
with appetite at 4:30 p.m. At 6 p.m. he became restless,
apprehensive and somewhat belligerent. He felt that something had
happened to his mother, that everybody was acting queerly and
picking on him. He continued to be agitated and fearful, refused
medication and slept poorly. This condition persisted and on
March 13th he was returned to Riker's Island. After four days
there he became quiet and composed. The psychotic state cleared
up completely. The resident psychiatrist's report was: Impression
1. Psychosis due to drugs. (Marihuana experimentally
administered.) Acute delirium, recovered. 2. Convulsive disorder,
idiopathic epilepsy. Petit mal on history. </p>

<p>H.W. Female. White. Age 28. Non-user. Drug peddler, serving
three years' indefinite sentence for unlawfully possessing a
drug. Her parents died when she was about 10 years old and she
was raised in an orphanage. At the age of 19 she entered a
training school for nurses, but gave this up after four months
and supported herself by prostitution. Her sister and her
sister's husband were drug addicts and through them she began
taking morphine and heroin, being, according to her account,
depressed and dissatisfied at the time. She continued using these
drugs up to the time of her arrest, a period of eight years. In
1938 she married a man who was also a drug addict, and engaged in
the drug traffic. </p>

<p>On May 7th she was given 2 cc. of marihuana. Aside from a
headache and a feeling of muscular weakness and uncoordination,
the effect was to make the subject feel gay and very good-natured
On May 8th she was given 3 cc. Of the concentrate and became
somewhat confused and unsteady, irritated and upset at carrying
out tests, and greatly worried about the physical symptoms. Five
hours after she had taken the drug the effects had largely passed
off. Six hours later, however, she became restless and agitated,
moving about constantly, and worried about past conduct. This
state continued for a few hours. On other occasions the subject
was given marihuana in doses of 2, 3, and 4 cc. Twice after the
administration of 3 cc. The general effect was of a euphoric
type, and after 4 cc. Had been given a state of sadness set in on
two occasions and one of euphoria on a third. Toward the end of
her stay the subject became depressed and moody, constantly
dwelling on the belief that she had committed unpardonable sins. </p>

<p>She was returned to the House of Detention on June 2nd,
transferred to the Psychiatric Division of Bellevue Hospital on
June 9th, and from there was sent to Matteawan State Hospital on
July 10th. On admission to the State Hospital she appeared
confused, retarded, apprehensive, and depressed. She had a marked
feeling of guilt. She began to improve in September and was
discharged, cured, in January. Since her return to New York she
reports at frequent intervals to the parole officer. She has
secured employment in a food shop and is to be promoted to the
position of manager of the shop. </p>

<p>The diagnosis made at the State Hospital was: Psychosis, due
to drugs and other exogenous poisons (morphine and heroin). </p>

<p>D.P. Male. Colored. Age 23. Occasional user. Sentenced for
unlawful possession of drugs. Since graduation from high school
at the age of 16 he had had no occupation. His criminal record
dated from his graduation. He was arrested in 1934 for disorderly
conduct and in the same year sentenced to Elmira Reformatory for
five years for second-degree assault. He was paroled in 1936, but
during the same and the following year was arrested three times
for assault or robbery. He was returned to Elmira where he
remained until his discharge in 1940. In August 1940 he was
arrested for the possession of drugs and sentenced to a
three-year indefinite term. He had served eight months of this
sentence when he was admitted to Welfare Hospital as a subject
for the marihuana study. </p>

<p>During his stay at Welfare Hospital, D.P. was given marihuana
in the form of a concentrate and as cigarettes on numerous
occasions. His symptoms and behavior corresponded to those
usually seen, lasting a few hours with no after-effects. When the
time came for his return to Riker's Island he urged that he be
allowed to stay at the hospital and assist in the study. Two
weeks after his return to the penitentiary he developed a
psychosis characteristic of schizophrenia. He was transferred to
Matteawan where the diagnosis made was: Psychosis with
psychopathic personality. </p>

<p>These three cases are of special interest from the standpoint
of the relationship of marihuana to the psychosis. The first
subject, R.H., had a definite history of epileptic attacks. After
smoking one marihuana cigarette he experienced an acute
confusional state which lasted a few hours. In the second episode
which lasted six days there was a more prolonged confusional
state. Epileptics are subject to such attacks, epileptic or
epileptic equivalents, which may be brought on by any number of
upsetting circumstances. In this case marihuana is the only known
factor which precipitated the attack. </p>

<p>The second subject, H.W., was a heroin addict of long
standing. During her stay in the hospital, in her retrospective
reports on her marihuana experiences there were usually included
expressions of worry and remorse at her failure to answer
questions or perform tests honestly, informing on the other women
in her group, and denials concerning a syphilitic infection she
thought she had had. Prior to this incarceration she had had no
prison experience. The mental picture developed from the study at
the hospital and at Matteawan and the subject's subsequent
history represent a fairly typical example of what is termed a
prison psychosis. </p>

<p>The third subject, D.P., did not develop his psychosis until
two weeks after he had been returned to the Riker's Island
Penitentiary. He had shown no unexpected effects from marihuana
and had hoped to be allowed to stay on at the hospital instead of
going back to prison to complete more than two years of an
unexpired sentence. At Matteawan this subject was considered to
have an underlying psychopathic personality. His case also may be
taken as an example of prison psychosis. With both the second and
third subjects, the exact role of marihuana in relation to the
psychosis cannot be stated. </p>

<p>Dr. Peter F. Amoroso, Commissioner of Correction of the city
of New York, has given us information concerning the prisoners
sentenced to the penitentiary at Riker's Island from whom our
subjects were drawn. During the year beginning July 1, 1941, and
ending June 30, 1942, there were 1,756 inmates in this
institution. They had received an indeterminate sentence, that
is, from a minimum of a few months to a maximum of three years.
Of this group, 175 were subjected to intensive study by the
psychiatrist because they were considered possible psychotic
cases, 117 were sex offenders, and 200 were miscellaneous cases
referred for mental observation, making a total of 492.
Twenty-seven of these cases were committed to state institutions
for the criminal insane, namely, 25 to Matteawan and 2 to
Dannemora. </p>

<p>Commissioner Amoroso, after reviewing these cases, writes as
follows: </p>

<p>&quot;The prison atmosphere may place a most severe strain on
those who are physically or mentally abnormal upon commitment . .
. Emotionally unstable persons find themselves during
incarceration denied the assertion and enjoyment of the basic
human urges and impulses and it is natural to expect, therefore,
that prison life may result in various types of explosions, such
as psychoses, neuroses, sex perversion, and even physical and
moral deterioration.' </p>

<p>&quot;I am indeed surprised that we had so little trouble with
our volunteers upon completion of their study and sojourn at
Welfare Hospital, and the few psychotic episodes that occurred
are exactly what we would expect in the whole group without
considering the administration and effects of excessive doses of
marihuana.&quot; </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In the study of the actions of marihuana in respect to
subjective and objective symptoms and behavior, the marihuana was
given a number of times to each of the subjects in the form of
the concentrate taken by stomach. The amount given ranged from 2
to 22 cc., in most cases from 2 to 5 cc. After marihuana was
taken, the systematic action became evident in from one- half to
one hour and the maximum effects were seen in from two to three
hours. They passed off gradually, usually in from three to five
hours, although in some instances they did not completely
disappear until twelve or more hours. </p>

<p>Of the symptoms occurring, a feeling of lightness in the head
with some dizziness, a sensation of floating in the air, dryness
of the throat, hunger and thirst, unsteadiness and heaviness in
the extremities were the most frequent. Tremor and ataxia,
dilation of the pupils and sluggishness in responsiveness to
light were observed in all subjects. </p>

<p>From observations on the behavior and responses of the
subjects, it was found that a mixture of euphoria and
apprehension was generally present. If the subjects were
undisturbed there was a state of quiet and drowsiness, and
unawareness of surroundings, with some difficulty in focusing and
sustaining mental concentration. If they were in company,
restlessness, talkativeness, laughter and joking were commonly
seen. A feeling of apprehension, based on uncertainty regarding
the possible effects of the drug and strengthened by any
disagreeable sensations present, alternated with the euphoria. If
the apprehension developed into a state of real anxiety, a spirit
of antagonism was shown. However, any resistance to requests made
to the subjects was passive and not physical and there was no
aggressiveness or violent behavior observed. Erotic ideas or
sensations when present took no active expression. </p>

<p>Six of the subjects developed toxic episodes characteristic of
acute marihuana intoxication. The dosage varied from 4 to 8 cc.
of the concentrate, and the episodes lasted from three to six
hours, in one instance ten hours. The effects were mixtures of
euphoric and anxiety states, laughter, elation, excitement,
disorientation and mental confusion. </p>

<p>The doses given were toxic to the individuals in question but
not to others taking the same or larger ones. Once the drug had
been taken the effects were beyond the subject's control. The
actions described took unusual expression because for the
particular subject at a particular time the dose was unusually
effective. A corresponding toxicity did not occur from cigarettes
for here the effects came on promptly and on the appearance of
any untoward effects, the smoking was stopped. </p>

<p>In three of the subjects a definite psychotic state occurred,
in two shortly after marihuana ingestion, in one after a two week
interval. Of the first two, one was an epileptic and the other
had a history of heroin addiction and a prepsychotic personality.
The third was considered a case of prison psychosis. The
conclusion seems warranted that given the potential personality
make-up and the right time and environment, marihuana may bring
on a true psychotic state. <br>

<p><b>LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>ORGANIC AND SYSTEMIC FUNCTIONS </h1>

<p><b>Samuel Allentuck, MD</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The functions of the body organs and systems were studied in
the manner common to hospital practice according to the methods
and with the equipment in use at Welfare Hospital. The study was
designed to show not only the effects of varying doses of
marihuana but also whether subjects who had long been users of
the drug gave evidence of organic damage. The tests were made
before the drug was administered, during its action, and often in
the after period. </p>

<p>The heart and circulation, blood composition, kidney, liver
and gastro-intestinal function, and basal metabolism received
special consideration. </p>

<hr>

<h2>SUMMARY </h2>

<p>The most consistent effect of marihuana observed in this
division of the study was an increase in pulse rate which began
shortly after the taking of the drug, reached a peak in about two
hours, and gradually disappeared. In-a few instances a temporary
sinus tachycardia or sinus bradycardia was noted, but except for
these there were no abnormalities in rhythm. The increase in
pulse rate was usually accompanied by a rise in blood pressure. </p>

<p>There was in general an increase in the blood sugar level and
in the basal metabolic rate, quite marked in some subjects, but
in the majority the levels reached did not exceed the high normal
limits. </p>

<p>An increase in the frequency of urination was often observed. </p>

<p>There was, however, no appreciable increase in the total
amount of urine passed during the drug action. </p>

<p>Hunger and an increase in appetite, particularly for sweets,
was noted in the majority of the subjects, and the taking of
candy or sweetened drinks brought down a &quot;too high&quot;
effect of the drug. </p>

<p>Nausea and vomiting occurred in a number of instances,
diarrhea only during psychotic episodes. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the blood showed no changes in cell count,
hemoglobin per cent, or the urea nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus
figures. The figures for the circulation rate and vital capacity
and the results of the phenolsulfonphthalein test for kidney
infection and the bromsulfalein test for liver function were not
different from those of the control period. The
electrocardiograms showed no abnormalties which could be
attributed to a direct action on the heart. In the few
observations on gastric motility and secretion no evidence of
marihuana action on these functions was obtained. </p>

<p>The positive results observed, increase in pulse rate and
blood pressure, increase in blood sugar and metabolic rate, urge
to urinate, increased appetite, nausea and vomiting, and
diarrhea, were not intensified by an increase in dosage, for they
could occur in an equal degree after the administration of any of
the effective doses within the range used. All the effects
described are known to be expressions of forms of cerebral
excitation, the impulses from this being transmitted through the
autonomic system. The alterations in the functions of the organs
studied come from the effects of the drug on the central nervous
system and are proportional to these effects. A direct action on
the organs themselves was not seen. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Psychological Aspects</h2>

<h3>PSYCHOPHYSICAL AND OTHER FUNCTIONS </h3>

<p>Robert S. Morrow, PH.D. </p>

<p>In this phase of the study an effort was made to determine the
effect of marihuana on various psychomotor and some special
mental abilities. Appraisal of these effects was made wherever
possible through the use of standardized tests. A number of
different tests were originally tried under varying experimental
conditions on the group of 5 volunteer subjects who had never
before taken marihuana. Only those tests were retained which, in
the course of this preliminary investigation demonstrated the
greatest potentialities. With the tests finally selected it was
hoped to measure the effect of marihuana on the following
functions. </p>

<p><b>FUNCTIONS AND CAPACITIES TESTED</b> </p>

<p>Static Equilibrium This was measured by means of the Miles
Ataxiameter, which is an instrument for recording body sway. The
subject remains stationary in the ataxiameter with his hands at
his sides and his feet together while a system of pulleys
attached to a helmet on his head records the direction and degree
of movement. The subject's score is the cumulative sway in all
directions measured in millimeters. This test was applied to each
subject for two minutes with his eyes open and two minutes with
his eyes closed. Each trial was followed by a rest period of five
minutes. </p>

<p>Hand Steadiness Hand steadiness was measured by means of the
Whipple Steadiness Tester which consists of a metal disk with a
hole 3/16 of an inch in diameter, connected in series with dry
cells, an electric counter, and a stylus. The subject was
instructed to hold the stylus in the hole for two minutes without
touching the metal sides. Each contact with the side of the hole
was recorded and the total number of contacts gave an index of
unsteadiness of hand.<br>
</p>

<p>Speed of Tapping Speed of tapping was measured in somewhat the
same manner as was hand steadiness. The Whipple Apparatus was
used, the tapping board replacing the steadiness disk and a
thicker and heavier stylus replacing the steadiness stylus. The
subject tapped repeatedly on the metal plate for two minutes and
the total number of taps was recorded on the counter, thereby
giving a measure of motor speed. <br>
</p>

<p>Strength of Grip The Collins Dynamometer was used to measure
the subject's strength of grip. Three trials were made for each
hand and the scores averaged. </p>

<p>Simple and Complex Hand and Foot Reaction Time Special
apparatus was constructed to measure simple and complex hand and
foot reaction time. To measure simple hand reaction time, the
subject was instructed to press down on a telegraph key and
remove his hand as quickly as possible when a red light appeared
on the board which stood directly before him. A Cenco counter
recorded the reaction time, that is, the time which elapsed
between the presentation of the stimulus and the response. </p>

<p>For the measurement of simple foot reaction time, the subject
pressed down on a pedal with his foot, removing it as quickly as
possible when the red light appeared. </p>

<p>For the measurement of complex (choice or discrimination) hand
and foot reaction time either a red or a blue light served as a
stimulus. The subject had no advance knowledge as to which color
light would appear. For measuring the response with the hand, the
subject pressed down on the telegraph key with the right hand
and, at the sight of the red light, moved the peg from the red
compartment into the center (neutral) compartment with the left
hand, then removed the right hand from the key; at the appearance
of the blue light, he moved the peg from the blue to the neutral
compartment. For measuring complex foot reaction time, the
procedure was similar to that for estimating the hand reaction
time except that the right foot and the pedal were substituted
for the right hand and the telegraph key. </p>

<p>Each subject made fifteen trials for each of the four
variations. </p>

<p>Musical Aptitude Musical aptitude was determined by means of
the Kwalwasser- Dykema Music Tests. The eight tests administered
were the tonal memory test, the quality discrimination test, the
intensity discrimination test, the tonal movement test, the time
discrimination test, the rhythm discrimination test, the pitch
discrimination test, and the melodic taste test. The sum of the
scores for these separate tests was used to give a total score
for musical aptitude. </p>

<p>Auditory Acuity By means of the Galton Whistle, the subjects'
limits of auditory acuity were gauged for both ascending and
descending frequencies. </p>

<p>The final score was the average of the results of three trials
in each direction. </p>

<p>Perception of Time An attempt was made to appraise the
subject's facility in estimating time by asking him to state
when, after a given signal, he thought the following intervals
had elapsed - fifteen seconds, one minute, and five minutes.
Several trials were given for each time interval and the average
of the results of the trials was taken as the final score. </p>

<p>Perception of Length Subjects were asked to estimate the
length of lines which were 3 inches, 5 inches, and 8 inches in
length and to draw lines of 3 inches and 7 inches. </p>

<p>The Subjects Fifty-four subjects were used in this part of the
experiment, 36 marihuana users and 18 non-users. The two groups
were equated approximately for the following factors: age,
height, weight, years of formal education, and number of arrests.
The age range for the user group was from 21 to 45 years with
27.9 years as an average, the age range for the non-user group
was from 22 to 43 years with 29.8 years as an average. The range
in height for the users was from 54 to 75 inches with a mean of
67.5 inches- for the non-users the range was from 60 to 71 inches
with a mean of 66.8 inches. Range in weight for the users was
from 123 to 178 pounds with 151.3 pounds as the mean, for the
non-users from 115 to 180 pounds with 149.5 pounds as the mean.
The schooling of the user group ranged from no education at all
to 10 years with a mean of 7.1 years, that of the non- users
varied from 6 to 12 years with a mean of 8.3 years. As regards
the number of arrests, the range for users was from 1 to 20 with
a mean of 5.1 and for the non-users from 1 to 15 with a mean of
5.3. </p>

<p>The two groups differed radically with respect to race. Of the
36 marihuana users, 11 (31 per cent) were white, 18 (50 per cent)
were Negroes, and 7 (19 percent) were Puerto Ricans. Of the 18
non- users, 12 (67 per cent) were white, 6 (33 per cent) were
Negroes, and none were Puerto Rican. </p>

<p>In addition, the user group was analyzed with respect to the
age when the marihuana habit was begun, the duration of the
habit, the number of marihuana cigarettes generally smoked per
day, and the period of deprivation. The variation of the habit as
already described for the entire group of users applies to the 36
subjects studied here. </p>

<p>Procedure The tests were first administered to the subjects
before they had taken marihuana, then about a week later when
they were under the influence of 2 cc. of marihuana, and finally
another week later after 5 cc.(1) of marihuana had been
administered. On each occasion the psychomotor tests for static
equilibrium, hand steadiness, tapping, strength of grip, and
reaction time were repeated at hourly intervals for eight
successive hours in order that the time-effects of marihuana
might be determined.(2) The other tests, that is, those measuring
musical ability, auditory acuity, visual ) memory, and perception
of time and length were given to the subjects while in the
undrugged condition and from three to four hours after the drug
had been administered. The music tests were given under normal
conditions and after 5 cc. of marihuana had been administered,
but not under 2 cc. dosage. </p>

<p>In almost all instances the marihuana was given in the morning
shortly after breakfast and generally after a day when no drug
had been taken in order that &quot;hangover&quot; effects might
be avoided. For the most part the subjects rested and did little
or nothing except the prescribed tests on days when marihuana was
taken. </p>

<p>The equilibrium, steadiness, tapping and strength of grip
tests were given together on one day and the different forms of
the reaction- time test on another day. Ordinarily four or five
days elapsed between retests. </p>

<p>In addition to being tested after standard doses of the
marihuana concentrate had been ingested, 11 users and 9 non-users
were tested after smoking marihuana cigarettes.(3) The cigarettes
weighed from 4 to 8 grains each. Most of the subjects smoked five
cigarettes, two non-users smoked only three, and one nonuser
smoked four. The tests with cigarettes were given at
quarter-hour, half-hour and hour intervals. </p>

<p>(1) A dose of 5 cc. of marihuana proved &quot;too much&quot;
for many non-user subjects in the sense that ingestion of this
amount was often followed by nausea and general symptoms of
malaise which interfered with further testing. </p>

<p>For this reason the higher dose for non-users was sometimes
reduced to 3 cc. or 4 cc. In all, only 6 of the non-user subjects
took the S cc. dose. Accordingly, although the higher dosage is
referred to as S cc. it should be noted that the actual amount
used varied from 3 cc. to 5 cc. </p>

<p>(2) The scores for the first 25 users and 6 non-users were
obtained every half hour, but since there was little difference
between the half-hourly and hourly results it was decided to
record hourly scores only, except for the first half hour. </p>

<p>(3) A short experiment in which placebos were employed was
also tried on these subjects. An attempt was made to have the
placebos simulate the marihuana as much as possible but
unfortunately the placebo pills had a distinctive taste which
rendered them easily identifiable. The subjects referred to them
as the &quot;licorice&quot; pills or the &quot;blanks.&quot;
While the experiment was completed and resulted in some
interesting findings, the factors which might have invalidated
the results were so serious that these experiments are not
reported at this time.<br>
</p>

<p>Summary and Conclusions </p>

<p>1. The effect of marihuana on the psychomotor functions
depends primarily on the complexity of the function tested.
Simpler functions like speed of tapping and simple reaction time
are affected only slightly by large doses (5 cc.) and negligibly,
if at all, by smaller doses (2 cc.). On the other hand, the more
complex functions like static equilibrium, hand steadiness, and
complex reaction time may be affected adversely to a considerable
degree by the administration of both large and small doses of
marihuana. </p>

<p>2. The function most severely affected is body steadiness and
hand steadiness. The ataxia is general in all directions rather
than predominant in any particular axis. </p>

<p>3. The effects produced by larger doses (5 cc.) are
systematically, though not necessarily proportionately, greater
than those brought about by small doses. </p>

<p>4. The time required by the drug to exert its maximum effect
varies somewhat with the function and size of dose, but, on the
whole, time curves for both functions and dosages have similarity
of form The effect of the drug begins from one to two hours after
ingestion and reaches its peak at the fourth hour, after which it
declines so that by the eighth hour most of it is dissipated. </p>

<p>5. When marihuana is taken in cigarette form the psychomotor
effects are similar in character and trend to those observed
after the ingestion of the drug but they occur much sooner and
taper off more quickly. </p>

<p>6. The effects seem to be essentially the same for women as
for men, except that women are sometimes affected maximally at
the second or third hour after the drug is administered. In women
the return to the normal condition is in some instances quicker
and more abrupt than it is in the men. </p>

<p>7. Non-users generally seem to be more affected by the drug
when it is ingested than are users. 8. Auditory acuity is not
affected by marihuana. </p>

<p>9. There is no evidence that musical ability, of non-musicians
at least, is improved by marihuana. </p>

<ol>
    <li>The ability to estimate short periods of time and short
        linear distances is not measurably affected by the
        ingestion of marihuana. </li>
</ol>

<h1>INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING </h1>

<p><b>Florence Halpern, MA</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this phase of the study investigation was directed
primarily toward establishing the effect of marihuana on the
subject's intellectual functioning. An attempt was made to
determine what changes in mental ability occur under different
amounts of the drug, what direction these changes take, when they
are first measurable, and how long they persist. </p>

<p>TESTS Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test This test was used to
measure the general mental level of all the subjects. It was
chosen in preference to other available scales because it is the
only individual test of intelligence which has been standardized
on an adult population, takes into account both verbal and
performance abilities, and compares the individual with standards
established for his particular age group. It consists of ten
tests, five verbal and five performance. The verbal tests cover
the fields of general information and general comprehension, draw
on the individual's capacity for abstract reasoning and test his
arithmetical ability and his rote memory. The performance tests
also evaluate the subject's comprehension of social situations,
but here the results are independent of language. There are also
tests of the individual's ability to carry out a routine task, to
organize parts into a meaningful whole, to distinguish between
essential and unessential details, and to analyze and synthesize.
Army Alpha (Bregman Revision, Forms A, B. 5, 7 and Bellevue
Revision) This is a group test first used in the United States
Army in 1917 and 1918 when it was given to more than a million
recruits. It consists of eight tests: test 1, a direction test
which was not used in this study since the item does not appear
on all forms; test 2, a test of arithmetical reasoning; test 3, a
test of common sense in which the subject indicates which he
considers the best of three possible responses to a given
question; test 4, a.modified vocabulary test; tests. in which the
subject must mentally reorganize disarranged sentences and then
indicate whether the resultant statement is true or false; test
6, a test of numerical relations in which the subject must supply
the last two numbers in a numerical series on the basis of the
relationship between the first six numbers; test 7, a test of
analogies in which the subject determines the relationship
between two given words and then underlines one of four words
which is related to a third word in the same way; and test 8,
which on Forms A and B and on the Bellevue Revision is a test of
general information in which the subject is given a choice of
five answers to a question. On Forms 5 and 7, this test is a test
of directions. </p>

<p>Because this test has five alternate forms which are roughly
of equivalent difficulty it could be repeated many times within a
short time interval. It was therefore used to establish a curve
showing at what time following ingestion the marihuana has an
effect on general intelligence and on individual higher mental
processes. Pyle's Digit Symbol Test In this test each number from
1 through 9 is associated with a specific symbol, as, for
example, number 1 is associated with a square and number 2 with
an asterisk. The numbers and their associated symbols appear at
the top of the sheet of paper. Below the sample are rows of
symbols, five symbols to a row, followed by five blank squares.
The subject is expected to fill in each square with the number
associated with the respective symbol. With practice the
association bond between the number and the symbol becomes
stronger and the subject depends less and less on the model at
the top of the sheet. He is therefore able to work faster and his
learning rate is reflected in the increased number of squares
filled. Cancellation Test The subject is required to cross out a
specific geometric form wherever it appears on a sheet which is
covered with rows of geometric figures. This measures the
individual's capacity for carrying out a routine task. </p>

<p>Form Board Test The measurement of the ability to manipulate
concrete material in contrast to the verbal or abstract ability
determined by the Army Alpha test required the introduction of
certain form board tests. These were the Seguin Form Board, the
Two Figure Board, the Casuist Board, - the Five Figure Board,
Healy A, Triangle Test, Diagonal Test, all administered and
scored according to the Pintner-Patterson Performance Series. The
Seguin Form Board has ten blocks of various goemetric forms, to
be put in their appropriate places as rapidly as possible. Three
trials are given. The Two Figure Board has nine pieces which,
when placed correctly, form a large cross and a large square.
Time and the number of moves are recorded. The Casuist Board has
twelve pieces which, when correctly placed, form three circles
and an oval. Time and errors are recorded. The Five Figure Board
has five geometrical figures which are formed by the correct
placement of two or three pieces for each figure. Time and errors
are recorded. Healy A has five small rectangular pieces which,
when placed correctly, form a large rectangle. Time and the
number of moves are recorded. The Triangle Test consists of four
triangular pieces which are fitted together in a board. Time and
errors are recorded. The Diagonal Test has five pieces of various
shapes which must be fitted together in a rectangular frame. Time
and moves are recorded. Kohs Block Design Test This is a
performance test which is less a test of manual dexterity and
more dependent on abstract intelligence than are the form board
tests. It correlates more highly with intelligence than do most
performance items and yet it is entirely independent of language.
Therefore, the individual who cannot express himself well or who
suffers from a language handicap is not penalized as he is on
verbal scales. The test consists of sixteen cubes each with a
red, a white, a blue, a yellow, a red-and- white, and a
blue-and-yellow side. A colored design which can be reproduced
with the cubes is placed before the subject and he is expected to
make it. Results are rated numerically, depending upon the time
consumed in execution. In this experiment two sets of designs of
equivalent difficulty were required- Designs IV, VI, and XIV were
selected for one series and V, VII, and XII for the other. </p>

<p>Memory Tests Although memory in itself cannot be considered a
measure of intelligence, it is essential to any intelligent
functioning and must therefore be included in any estimate of
intelligence. Three aspects of memory, namely rote memory, the
ability tof recall presented objects, and visual memory were
tested. The rote memory test requires the repetition of digits in
forward and reverse order as given on the Bellevue Intelligence
Test. Object memory was tested by exposing ten small objects for
three seconds and recording the number of articles the subject
was able to recall. Visual memory or the ability to reproduce
designs after a ten-second exposure was estimated by using the
designs and scoring technique from the Army Performance Test.
PROCEDURE The Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test Each subject was
given the Bellevue Adult Intelligence test within two or three
days after his admission to the hospital and before any marihuana
had been administered. </p>

<p>The Army Alpha, Pyle's Digit Symbol, and Cancellation Tests
These tests were given as group tests to a total of 20 subjects.
The Army Alpha and Pyle's Digit Symbol tests were given every
half-hour, beginning a half-hour after drug ingestion. The Army
Alpha was continued for seven hours and Digit Symbol for five
hours. The Cancellation test was given every hour for six hours,
beginning one hour after drug administration. Eleven users and 9
non-users took the Army Alpha and the Digit Symbol tests, while 9
users and 11 non-users took the Cancellation test. Tests 2
through 8 of the Army Alpha require twenty and a half minutes for
actual performance while such preparations as the distribution of
papers and the reading of directions consume almost ten minutes
more, so that had the entire Alpha been given at each half-hourly
session, the subjects would have gone from test to test with no
intermittent rest period. For this reason the tests were divided
and the following schedule arranged: (table a)<br>
Each subject took three test series, one without the drug, one
with 2 cc. and one with 3, 4, 5, or 6 cc., depending on indi
vidual tolerance. A test series consisted of fourteen half-hour
sessions for the Alpha, ten half- hour sessions for the Digit
Symbol and seven hourly sessions for the Cancellation tests.
Because of the time factor, a series required two days for its
completion. The halves of a series were given on successive days,
and the different series a week apart. Thus for example, a
subject might take his first test series with 2 cc. on Monday and
Tuesday of one week; the following Monday and Tuesday the series
would be repeated with the subject in a different drug state (no
drug or S cc.); and a final series would be given the third week
with the subject in still another drug condition. </p>

<p>An effort was made to obviate practice effect by giving the
first test series to one third of the subjects without drug, to
one third with 2 cc., and to one third with 3, 4, or 5 cc.
However because of the necessity of increasing dosage gradually
this ideal presentation was not actually obtained. The following
gives the amount of drug administered to users and non-users at
each test series. </p>

<p>(table b) Since the various forms of the Army Alpha are not
absolutely equivalent in difficulty, their order of presentation
for any one group had to be identical in each of the three drug
states. However, for each of the three groups tested the order of
presentation was different so that all the difficult forms did
not come at the same interval, as is shown on the following page.
Kohs Block Design, Form Board, and Memory Tests Administration of
these tests differed markedly from those discussed above in that
no attempt was made to give them at regular successive time
intervals. Rather, they formed part of a battery of individual
tests given to various subjects under specific drug conditions.
For example, 5 cc. of marihuana would be ordered for a patient
for 8:00 A.M., and testing began as soon thereafter as the
patient appeared &quot;high,&quot; the state of
&quot;highness&quot; being judged by the subject's own statement,
his pulse rate, the condition of his pupils and other
physiological signs. </p>

<p>(table c) Kohs Block Design was given to each subject twice,
once without the drug and once with 5 cc. The test was taken by a
total of 21 subjects, 10 users and 11 non-users. Five users tools
the test first without the drug, S had their first trial with 5
cc. Of the non-user group 8 had their first trial without
marihuana, 3 with 4 cc. The average time at which the test was
given to the user group was three and a half hours after drug
administration, with range from two to five and a half hours. For
the nonuser group, the average time of administration of the test
was also three and a half hours after the drug was given, range
two and a half to five and a half hours. </p>

<p>The two series of designs (one series being Designs IV, VI and
XIV, the other V, VII and XII) were presented in such manner that
half of the subjects were tested on one series and half on the
other series while they were under the influence of marihuana.
Thus any difference in degree of difficulty between the two sets
of designs was canceled out. The weighted scores given on the
Arthur Point scale were used in evaluating the results. </p>

<p>Form Board Tests were divided into three batteries, each
battery consisting of the Seguin Form Board, one of the three
larger boards (Two Figure, Five Figure, or Casuist) and one of
the three smaller boards. Various combinations of boards were
used under various drug conditions in order to make the results
as comparable as possible. The following indicates the number of
times the various boards were used with different dosages of
marihuana. </p>

<p>From the results it appears that Gwyn Triangle was used too
often with 5 cc. and Healy A was not used often enough. </p>

<p>(table d) </p>

<p>Aside from the Triangle and the Healy A, the distribution of
boards in different drug stages was such as to obviate any
differences in degree of difficulty. Nineteen subjects, 10 users
and 9 non- users, took this test. The results were scored for
time and errors according to the Pintner-Patterson Performance
series. </p>

<p>Memory tests. The first digit span test was always given
before marihuana had been administered, since the Bellewe Scale
was given each patient during the first two or three days of the
study. The trials under 2 cc. and 5 cc. were alternated. In all,
28 subjects, 17 users and 11 non-users, took this test before and
after the ingestion of marihuana. The final score equaled the
number of digits recalled. </p>

<p>To test Object Memory, ten small articles such as a key, a
ring, a pill box, and a crayon were placed on a flat, neutral
surface and exposed for three seconds. An attempt was made to
vary some of the articles at each presentation so that six or
seven were the same and three or four were different. Twenty-six
subjects, 11 users and 15 non-users, took this test. They were so
divided that 10 of them took the test the first time without
drug, 10 with 2 cc., and 6 with 5 cc. </p>

<p>To test Visual Memory, Army designs were given each subject
three times, once prior to the administration of marihuana, once
under 2 cc., and once under 5 cc. The test was riven to a total
of 28 subiects. 16 users and 12 non-users. Because there is no
alternative form for this test, results were definitely
influenced by practice. </p>

<p>Here, therefore, more than with any other test, it became
important to arrange the order of administration. The following
indicates the dosage of marihuana at the first test. </p>

<p>(table e) </p>

<p>It is obvious that the initial examination was given slightly
more often when the subjects were not under the influence of the
drug. </p>

<p>Improvement derived from practice is therefore more of a
factor in the tests which were performed under marihuana. </p>

<hr>

<h2>FINDINGS</h2>

<p>Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test General Intelligence. The
results of the Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test which was
administered to 60 subjects, 40 users and 20 non-users, are shown
in Table 5. As has been pointed out elsewhere, these findings
indicate that both the user and the non-user groups may be
classified as of average intelligence. </p>

<p>(Table 5) </p>

<p>Mental Deterioration. Studies of mental deterioration due to
toxic, organic or psychotic factors, as given in the literature,
reveal that in such cases the subtest scores on the Bellevue
Adult Intelligence Test show marked irregularity, depending upon
the functions involved in the deteriorative process. As a group,
the marihuana users tested show very even functioning, and what
little irregularity occurred can be explained on the basis of
language and racial factors.(4) From this we may conclude that
the marihuana users had suffered no mental deterioration as a
result of their use of the drug. The age factor does not affect
the result since the groups were well equated in this respect. </p>

<p>Army Alpha Test Total Mental Functioning. The total scores
obtained from this test at the successive testing periods are
shown in Table 6. Those recorded before the administration of the
drug give a picture like that seen in any learning curve, that
is, there is a gradual increment in test scores at each testing
interval, interspersed with plateau periods. </p>

<p>Thus, without drug the test score for the second testing
interval showed a 2 per cent gain over the initial score, the
score for the third testing interval showed a 4 per cent gain
over the initial score, and so on up to the last testing period
when there was a 13 per cent gain over the initial test score. </p>

<p>Between two and a half and three hours after ingestion of 2
cc. of the drug there appeared to be a possible very slight
falling off in mental ability. Otherwise the results paralleled
the findings obtained in the undrugged condition except that
toward the end of the day the increments were larger than those
which occurred when the subjects were undrugged. This may be due
to complications in the experimental procedure or may be an
indication of accelerated mental functioning resulting from drug
ingestion. This point is discussed more fully when the effect on
different mental functions is considered. </p>

<p>Deleterious effects were apparent an hour after the ingestion
of 5 cc. of marihuana. There was a 3 per cent drop from the
initial score at this one-hour period and this first attainment
is not surpassed until four and a half hours after drug
ingestion. From the four-and-a- half- hour period on to the end
of the testing there were gradual increments in score. </p>

<p>Different Mental Functions. A very elaborate study was made of
the scores made on the subtest (Table 7). Some irregularities
occurred even in the undrugged state, and these may be attributed
primarily to chance factors, as, for example, the difference in
difficulty of the various test forms. On the whole, the findings
were in line with those which one would expect in any situation
where constant repetition increases efficiency. </p>

<p>The effects of 2 cc. of marihuana on the different mental
functions were variable. Tests involving number concepts gave
clear-cut, consistent findings and revealed that impairment
occurred an hour after the drug was taken and continued for from
two and a half to three hours after ingestion. Results of other
tests showed that there was little if any loss in ability, and
some of them, especially those done toward the end of the day,
showed gains which exceeded the ones made in the undrugged state.
It is not possible on the basis of the present data to ascertain
whether these large increments indicate that small amounts of the
drug serve as stimulants in situations dependent primarily upon
verbal facility or whether they are due to certain complications
in the test technique. The former theory coincides with the
increased verbosity noted on other tests as well as with the
clinical impression, but the latter also cannot be overlooked. </p>

<p>Further investigation of this point is definitely indicated. </p>

<p>The effect of the 5 cc. dosage on each function was in line
with that reported for total scores, that is, there was a falling
off in efficiency one hour after the drug was taken and this
impairment continued for anywhere from three and a half to six
and a half hours after ingestion. Here too the scores on tests
involving number concepts were most severely affected, recovery
for them taking place from six to six and a half hours after drug
administration. </p>

<p>Degree and Duration of Drug Effect. In general it may be
stated that marihuana has a deleterious effect on mental
functioning, the extent, time of onset, and duration of the
impairment being related to the amount of drug taken. </p>

<p>The adverse effect of the 2 cc. dosage on global intelligence
was slight (about 3 per cent to 4 per cent impairment in
efficiency) and of sort duration, occurring at about two and a
half hours after ingestion and lasting little longer than a
half-hour or an hour. Certain mental functions, especially those
dealing with number concepts, appear to have been affected much
earlier than others, the effect on the number test scores being
measurable as early as one hour after ingestion and continuing
until two and a half hours after ingestion. For other functions,
in particular those involving verbal facility, the results were
variable, in some instances showing no adverse effect and even a
slight acceleration. </p>

<p>The effect of 5 cc. of marihuana on global intellectual
functioning was apparent within an hour from the time the drug
was taken and was operative until four and a half hours after
ingestion. All mental functions showed this early impairment but
for some of them recovery from the adverse effect was earlier
than for others. Those most severely impaired from point of view
of duration were the ones dealing with number concepts. </p>

<p>(Table 6) </p>

<p>The testing program was continued for only seven hours after
the drug was taken and, therefore, any estimate of the effect of
marihuana after this time is purely a subjective one. However,
both the subject and the examiner felt that the drug produced a
&quot;hang- over&quot; which in most cases continued into the
following day. The subject complained of being headachy, sleepy,
and unable to work at his usual level, and the examiner also
noted that the subject did not work as well or as quickly when
called upon to do something on a day following marihuana
ingestion. </p>

<p>The impairment reported here is not entirely representative of
the maximum impairment which occurs under the influence of
marihuana. Two opposing variables account for the results
obtained in the drugged condition. One variable is practice
effect which tends to increase test scores with each succeeding
trial. The other variable, the drug, tends to lower test scores.
In the earlier sessions there was evidence that the marihuana,
especially when given in large doses, is the more potent force,
as seen by the continuing downward trend of the curve during the
first few hours. In these earlier phases, in spite of repetition,
results were lower with each succeeding trial, or if there was no
actual loss, the increments made were never comparable to those
made in the undrugged state. Three or four hours after drug
administration there was a general trend toward rising scores.
Some of this gain must be attributed to increased practice effect
which was counteracting, in part at least, the deleterious effect
of the marihuana. For this reason it is not certain that the drug
was less effective at later points in the curve than it was at
the moment of seemingly greatest impairment. This seems
particularly plausible because, beginning with the third hour,
the subject was no longer working on new tasks but was actually
repeating identical tasks that he performed earlier in the day.
Thus, at the third hour the test form used was the same as the
one given at the initial session; at the end of the
three-and-a-half-hour period the form was the same as the
one-hour examination, and so on. What is shown in the curves is
the effect of marihuana on intellectual tasks with which the
subject has become very familiar. For practical purposes the test
situation has the advantage of being comparable with daily living
since the tasks performed in daily routine are usually relatively
familiar ones. </p>

<p>(Table 7) </p>

<p>Speed Versus Power. Intellectual impairment under the
influence of marihuana resulted from a loss in both speed and
efficiency. There was a slowing up in output indicated by the
difference in the number of items done before and after the
administration of the drug. On the whole the number of test items
attempted tended to increase at each succeeding examination
period even when the subject was under the influence of
marihuana, but the percentage of increase in the drugged state
practically never equaled that attained for the corresponding
time interval when the subject had not ingested the drug. The
findings for the number of items done in the drugged and
undrugged condition follow very closely the findings in respect
to the number of items correctly done. From this it may be
concluded that under the influence of marihuana an individual
functions less rapidly and also less efficiently than when he has
had no drug. </p>

<p>Careful analysis of what causes the loss in efficiency reveals
that certain factors not necessarily related to mental ability
per se were accountable for the reduced scores in the drugged
state. For example, under the influence of the drug the subject
felt dizzy, had blurred vision, or exhibited other handicapping
physiological disturbances. These impeded his efficiency in
putting his answer on the correct line, or marking a cross in the
right box. Men were observed running their fingers across the
page in an effort to keep their place. On the other hand, much of
the intellectual loss can be ascribed to an impairment in the
thinking processes, and there seemed to be a general confusion of
ideas and inability to maintain a fixed goal. Some subjects
reported that the reason they accomplished so little was that, by
the time they had finished reading a question, they no longer
remembered what their purpose in reading it had been.
Occasionally perseveration of a form of response specific to one
test was found in a subsequent test. For example, some forms of
the Same-Opposite test require the subject to mark the answer S
or O. In a later test requiring a plus or minus response
occasional irrelevant S's or O's appeared. </p>

<p>Comparison of the Effect of Marihuana on User and Non-User. </p>

<p>When the group is divided into marihuana users and nonusers
certain interesting and suggestive differences are revealed
(Table 8). </p>

<p>Although the general findings for total intelligence scores
for the two groups follow similar curves, the deleterious effects
were not as great on the user as on the non-user. Thus under 2
cc. of marihuana the user showed no real intellectual impairment
except for a very short interval beginning about two and a half
hours after ingestion and lasting for an hour or an hour and a
half. In contrast to this he made gains both at the beginning of
the testing and toward the end of the day which exceeded those
made in the undrugged state. The non-user who had ingested 2 cc.
of marihuana showed a definite drop in score beginning about two
and a half hours after ingestion, and for a period from one and a
half to two and a half hours after this time he did not make
increments comparable to those which he made in the undrugged
state. Following this, during the last two hours of testing he,
like the user, obtained scores which showed an acceleration not
paralleled in the undrugged state. </p>

<p>(Table 8) </p>

<p>Under 5 cc. of marihuana both the user and the non-user showed
a 3 per cent loss in efficiency within an hour of the time that
the drug was taken. Although recovery was slow for both groups,
the user was less severely affected, as is indicated by the fact
that at the next testing interval his score was only 1 per cent
below his initial score as compared with a 7 per cent loss on the
part of the non-user. The disparity in the degree of impairment
for the two groups continued for several hours. The more marked
drug effect in the case of the non-user was further evidenced by
the fact that the user showed recovery four or four and a half
hours after ingestion (as measured by the time when his scores
approach those made when in the undrugged state) while the
non-user, even at the end of seven hours of testing, did not
approximate his undrugged performances. </p>

<p>No simple explanation of this difference is available. The
most probable reason seems to be that previous use of the drug in
some way serves to ameliorate that anxiety and inevitable
disorganization which the use of any drug may have on an
individual who has never taken it before. Another explanation may
lie in possible physiological adaptation to the drug which,
though not identical with tolerance in the ordinary
pharmacological sense, seems to act in the same direction. </p>

<p>Variability. The results reported here are all in terms of
averages. </p>

<p>A study of individual scores indicates that there was marked
variability in the effect of the drug on different subjects. In
one case the drug action came early and soon disappeared. Another
subject experienced no reaction until after he had eaten his
lunch, at which time a very definite effect was apparent. A third
subject showed impairment late in the day when the drug effect on
almost all the other subjects had worn off. There were some hardy
souls who did not appear to be affected by even large quantities
of marihuana, while a few (mainly non-users) became so ill that
they could not continue with the examinations. </p>

<p>Pyle's Digit Symbol Test Comparison of the results obtained on
this test when the subject was in the undrugged condition and
when he had had 2 cc. of marihuana reveals that small amounts of
the drug did not interfere with his ability to carry out the
appointed task (Table 9). In fact, as was noted above for certain
other tests, the improvement in score at the end of two and a
half or three hours was greater after the ingestion of 2 cc. of
marihuana than it was when no drug had been administered, and at
the end of the five-hour testing period there was a 32 per cent
increase in score as against a 22 per cent increase in the
undrugged condition. </p>

<p>Under the influence of 5 cc. of marihuana, however, there was
a decrease in ability occuring within an hour after the time the
drug was administered. Although the scores show no actual loss as
compared with the initial score, the increments did not equal
those made in the undrugged condition until from four to four and
a half hours after ingestion. </p>

<p>It may therefore be concluded that certain types of learning
ability are not affected by small amounts (2 cc.) of marihuana,
but are impaired when larger amounts (5 cc.) are ingested. </p>

<p>(Table 9) (Table 10) </p>

<p>Cancelling a Geometric Form The results of this test are shown
in Table 10. </p>

<p>With 2 cc. of marihuana, there was a slight falling off in the
subject's efficiency occurring about three hours after drug
ingestion. </p>

<p>At that time he was 3 per cent less efficient than he had been
an hour previous. With S cc. of marihuana there was a slowing up
in the subject's ability to carry out the appointed task, which
was apparent two hours after drug ingestion (and possibly
earlier). At that time there was only a 4 per cent increment over
his initial score as compared with a 10 per cent increment in the
undrugged state and a 12 per cent increment when the 2 cc. dosage
had been administered. </p>

<p>He improved only slightly at the three- and four-hour testing
interval, and only at the five-hour interval did he show an
appreciable improvement. </p>

<p>Apparently, the carrying out of a simple routine task is
adversely affected to a slight degree and for a short period of
time as the result of the ingestion of 2 cc. of marihuana while
the ingestion of S cc. of the drug produces adverse effects which
are more severe and more lasting. </p>

<p>Performance Tests Seguin Form Board. For adults of average
intelligence this test is primarily one involving speed of
reaction time. The average time taken by the subjects when they
were not under the influence of marihuana was 12.8 seconds. This
was increased to 14.0 and 14.1 seconds under doses of 2 cc. and 5
cc. respectively. Thus, ingestion of marihuana in 2 cc. and 5 cc.
doses caused a 9 per cent delay in performance time. </p>

<p>Form Boards. The time scores for this test remained
practically the same whether no drug, 2 cc. or 5 cc. of marihuana
had been administered, the average scores in terms of mental age
being respectively 11.7, 11.7 and 11.9 years. The error scores
also showed little change as a result of drug ingestion, the
averages in terms of mental age being 9.7 years (no marihuana),
9.9 years (2 cc.) and 10.2 years (5 cc.), and what change
occurred was in a positive direction, that is, there was a very
slight improvement in the subject's performance when he was under
the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>Kohs Block Design. This test correlates more highly with
abstract intelligence than do any of the other performance tests.
Here the drug had a definitely deleterious effect when it was
administered in large amounts. The average score was 17.6 when
the subjects were not under the influence of marihuana and 14.8
after they had ingested the drug; that is, under S cc. of
marihuana there was a 16 per cent loss in score as compared with
undrugged results. </p>

<p>In general it appears that those functions most closely as
sociated with higher intellectual processes are more impaired by
the drug than are the simpler functions.<br>
Memory Tests Rote Memory. As measured by the ability to repeat
digits forward there were no changes in rote memory as a result
of drug ingestion, the average scores under no drug, 2 cc. of
marihuana, and 5 cc. of marihuana being in each case 7.1. </p>

<p>Digits Reversed. Although the giving of digits in reverse
order is always grouped with memory testss this task actually
requires something over and above mere recall. It demands a
mental control not necessary in tests dependent purely upon rote
memory. Although simple rote memory, as measured by the ability
to repeat digits forward, was not affected by the ingestion of
marihuana, the repetition of digits reversed was affected
adversely. In the undrugged state the average for the group was
5.4, with 2 cc. the average was 5.0, and with S cc. it was 4.8.
The impairment was comparatively small but it seems to have been
related to the amount of drug taken. </p>

<p>Object Memory. The average scores under no drug, 2 cc. of
marihuana, and 5 cc. of marihuana were respectively 6.2, 5.6, and
5.9- that is, there was a loss of about 9 per cent in the
subject's ability to recall objects which had been exposed to his
vision for three seconds when he took the test under the
influence of 2 cc. of marihuana, while after the ingestion of 5
cc. the impairment was less, being only about 5 per cent. This
seemingly contradictory result is probably due to the fact that
by the time the subjects took the test under the influence of 5
cc. most of them had already had it two times previously. The
loss in terms of absolute number of remembered articles was
slight. </p>

<p>Visual Memory. In this test as in the case of digits reversed
something over and above simple memory function is involved. A
capacity for analysis and synthesis which correlates well with
intelligence is required for the successful execution of this
task, and it is this function which is adversely affected by the
ingestion of marihuana. The average scores were 10.3 (no drug),
9.7 (2 cc.) and 7.8 (5 cc.); that is, after the ingestion of 2
cc. of marihuana there was a 6 per cent drop in score, while
under 5 cc. there was a 24 per cent drop. </p>

<p>In general one may conclude that simple memory functions are
not affected by the administration of marihuana while the more
complex memory functions are affected adversely, the extent of
the impairment being related to the amount of drug taken. </p>

<p>Throughout the examination of subjects on individual tests,
the same difference was observed in intensity of the effect upon
user and non-user as was noted in group tests.<br>
Experiments with Marihuana cigarettes In addition to the tests
made to determine the effect of the ingestion of marihuana on
various intellectual functions, several experiments were tried
with marihuana cigarettes. The tests used in this part of the
study were the Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test; the Woody McCall
Mixed Fundamentals Test, Form I, which consists of thirty-five
examples requiring addition, subtraction, multiplication or
division; a cancellation test in which the subject is required to
cross out a specific number (in this instance the number 8)
wherever it appears on a sheet covered with rows of numbers; the
Kohs Block Design Test; and the test for rote, object, and visual
memory. </p>

<p>The subjects took the test series and individual tests twice,
once without the drug and once after having smoked marihuana
cigarettes. They were not given a specific number of cigarettes
but were told to smoke until they felt &quot;high.&quot; The
number of cigarettes smoked to produce this effect ranged from
two to seven. </p>

<p>The Mixed Fundamentals and cancellation tests were given as
group tests and were repeated at half-hour intervals for two and
a half hours. In the series given when the subjects were
&quot;high,&quot; the first test was taken as soon as the
cigarettes had been smoked. Time limit on each test was one and a
half minutes. </p>

<p>The Bellevue Adult, Kohs, and memory tests were given as
individual tests and were administered only twice, once before
the subject had smoked marihuana cigarettes and once after he had
become &quot;high&quot; from smoking them. If during the course
of the examination he wanted another cigarette or the examiner
had reason to suspect that he was no longer under the influence
of the drug, more cigarettes were smoked. The number of
cigarettes used during a three-hour testing period ranged from
six to twelve. </p>

<p>In the cancellation, Kohs, and memory tests the subjects were
so divided that half took the tests for the first time before
they had smoked and half after they had smoked. In the Woody
McCall Mixed Fundamentals Test more non-users had their first
tests before they had smoked. The Bellevue Adult Intelligence
Test was always given first without the drug during the two or
three days immediately following the subject's admission. Four
weeks later the test was repeated on 10 subjects while they were
under the influence of marihuana cigarettes. </p>

<p>Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test Ten subjects, 5 users and 5
non-users, repeated this test under the influence of marihuana.
The results are shown in Table 11. </p>

<p>(TABLE 11) </p>

<p>Since the test taken when the subject was &quot;high&quot; was
always his second experience with it, some allowance must be made
for practice effect. Without drug the average I.Q. of these
subjects was 101.6, while after they had smoked cigarettes it was
104.4. This increase of only 2.8 points is smaller than one would
probably get with repetition occurring after such a short time
interval. It may be concluded, therefore, that smoking marihuana
cigarettes has some negative effect on intellectual functioning,
in that the subject benefits less from previous experiences than
he would if he had not smoked. <br>
Woody McCall Mixed Fundamentals Test, Form 1 This test was given
to 24 subjects, 10 users and 14 non-users. </p>

<p>&gt;From the results which are shown in Table 12 it may be
concluded that when the subject was &quot;high&quot; after
smoking marihuana cigarettes there was a slowing up in his
ability to do simple arithmetic calculations. This lag occurred
within the first half-hour after smoking and continued for at
least an hour. The deleterious effect was not such as to cause an
actual loss in ability but the increments resulting from repeated
practice were never as great in the drugged as in the undrugged
state. Thus, the initial increment was 10 per cent in the test
given before smoking and only 4 per cent in the one administered
after the subject had become &quot;high.&quot; The final
increment at the end of two and a half hours was 20 per cent
without drug, 13 per cent with drug. </p>

<p>This test measures the subject's ability to use acquired
knowledge. </p>

<p>Under the influence of marihuana cigarettes the capacity for
using such an acquired skill is not lost but is slowed down. The
adverse effect of smoking marihuana in cigarette form occurs
almost immediately in contrast to the delayed action of the
pills. </p>

<p>(TABLE 12) </p>

<p>Cancelling 8's Sixteen subjects, 8 users and 8 non-users, took
this test, the results of which are shown in Table 13. As a
result of smoking marihuana cigarettes the subject worked a
little slower in his execution of a routine task than he did when
he had not smoked. The increment over the initial score in the
test score made a half-hour after he became &quot;high&quot; was
only 7 per cent as against an increment of 9 per cent when the
cigarettes had not been smoked. His performance was slowed up for
one hour after smoking and possibly longer. </p>

<p>(TABLE 13) </p>

<p>Kohs Block Design Test This test, which measures performance
ability, was given to a total of 9 subjects, 6 users and 3
non-users. The average score without the drug was 18.5, and after
cigarettes had been smoked 14.7. This difference in score of 3.8
points indicates a loss in efficiency of 21 per cent. </p>

<p>Memory Tests Rote Memory. Thirteen users and 9 non-users took
this test. </p>

<p>Neither in repeating digits forward nor in giving them in
reverse did the subjects show any disadvantageous effects from
the use of marihuana cigarettes, the average scores before and
after smoking being 6.9 and 7.1 respectively for the digits
forward test and 5.2 and 5.1 for the digits reversed test. The
only explanation for this deviation from the results obtained
when marihuana was taken in pill form is the inability to control
the dosage when marihuana is given in cigarette form. </p>

<p>Object Memory. Thirteen subjects took this test. Object memory
was not impaired by the smoking of marihuana, the average scores
being 6.8 before the cigarettes were smoked and 7.1 when the
subjects were &quot;high.&quot; Visual Memory. There was an .8
point loss (from 10-5 to 9.7) in the average score of the 20
subjects, 11 users and 9 non-users, who took this test. This
represents an impairment of about 8 per cent. </p>

<p>Effect of Marihuana Cigarettes on Users and Non-Users The
difference in intensity of effect of marihuana cigarettes on the
user and on the non- user was not the same as the difference in
the effect of the marihuana concentrate on these two groups. The
user was usually more affected by smoking marihuana than was the
non- user, probably because the nonuser did not smoke as much or
as intensely as the user and was not as much under the influence
of the drug. <br>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marijuana </b></p>

<h1>FINDINGS </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Rorschach Test</b> </p>

<p>Table 14 gives the Rorschach findings for 45 subjects both in
the undrugged and drugged states. The measurable changes on the
test which occurred during the period of drug intoxication were
few and not far-reaching. They may be considered indications of
tendencies rather than of significant alterations of the
personality. </p>

<p>(TABLE 14) </p>

<p>When the subjects were under the influence of marihuana
(either 3- 6 cc. or cigarettes, the number of cigarettes being at
the discretion of the smoker) there was a slightly freer flow of
associations than there was when they were in the undrugged
state, an increased productivity which coincided with the
impressions obtained from general observation of the subjects
when they were &quot;high.&quot; Without drug the average number
of interpretations made was 20.0, with drug 23.3. This increased
number of responses was due primarily to the subject's greater
awareness of small, extraneous details which in his undrugged
state he overlooked. Thus, while 17 per cent of the subjects'
answers were small or rare detail responses when no marihuana had
been administered, with marihuana this increased to 21 per cent.
Coincidental with his increased absorption in the irrelevant
there was a slight decrease in the subject's drive to organize
and synthesize. Whereas without drug 40 per cent of the responses
involved the entire blot, with drug this was true of only 36 per
cent of the interpretations. Under the influence of marihuana
there was a mild tendency for the subject to become preoccupied
with minutiae rather than to concern himself with the larger,
more important aspects of a situation, and this implies some
falling off in meaningful constructive behavior. </p>

<p>When the subject had taken marihuana there was some decrease
in the objectivity with which he sized up situations. This was
indicated by the fact that without drug 92 per cent of his
interpretations were good form, that is, they corresponded to the
form of the blot, while with drug this percentage fell to 86 per
cent. The drug had an adverse effect on the individual's critical
faculty and he was more prone to jump to erroneous conclusions
than he was when he was in the undrugged state. </p>

<p>The only other change that occurred on the Rorschach test
after the ingestion of marihuana was the decrease in the
subject's ability to think in line with the group. This showed
itself in the decreased number of popular interpretations made,
the drop being from 27 per cent without drug to 20 per cent with
drug. In other words, during the period of drug intoxication an
individual is somewhat less likely to see the obvious and the
commonplace than he is in his normal state. </p>

<p>As important, or possibly even more important, than the
changes which occurred on the Rorschach after ingestion or
smoking of marihuana, is the fact that some of the most basic
personality attributes remained unchanged. Thus it appeared that
33 per cent of the subjects in the undrugged state were what is
described as introversive, that is, they were individuals who
tend to withdraw somewhat from the world about them and depend
primarily on their own inner resources for emotional stimulation;
20 per cent were extraversive, depending mainly on their
environment for affective satisfaction; 20 per cent were
ambivert, showing equal potentialities in both directions; and 27
per cent were emotionally constricted to the point where they
gave little or no evidence of emotional response of any type.
With drug 36 per cent were introversive, 22 per cent were
extraversive, 20 per cent were ambivert, and 22 per cent were
constricted. Marihuana ingestion or smoking served to dilate the
emotional life of only 2 of the subjects and shifted the type of
1. In all 3 cases the change was actually a very slight one. The
fact that the emotional trends remain essentially unchanged under
the influence of marihuana was further revealed by the fact that
the ratio for evaluating the individual's emo tional type, that
is, the ratio of movement to color, remained roughly the same
before and after he had taken the drug, being 2.3:1.6 when he was
in the undrugged state and 2.9:2.1 when he was in the drugged
phase. </p>

<p>Although the quantitative changes occurring with marihuana
ingestion or smoking were not large, there was a qualitative
difference in the protocols obtained from the subjects in the
undrugged and drugged stages. Not only was there a slight
increase in the actual number of interpretations made, but the
amount of talking and extraneous comment increased. The subject
played around with answers and often repeated them. He seemed
anxious to get his every thought clearly across to his audience.
More than this, he was much freer in the type of interpretation
he allowed himself. </p>

<p>For example, one interpretation on Card II read: &quot;Two
dogs. Now wait a minute. I don't want to jump to conclusions but
it looks as if the dogs were having intercourse and there was a
rupture.&quot; This response was not repeated when the subject
was retested in the undrugged state. Nor was this individual
unique in showing this qualitative difference. The disinhibition
and lessening of restraint which was a definitely observable
effect of the drug was also reflected in the assured explanations
and lengthy tirades which the subject offered on topics which in
his undrugged state he would undoubtedly feel were beyond him.
Thus one subject interpreted Card X as &quot;old bark of trees,
roots dried up. It's thousands of years old; it takes thousands
of years to do that. I got to tell you that. I got to cover for
you. You wouldn't know about a thousand years ago. I'm smart
now.&quot; In some instances the &quot;cockiness&quot; induced by
his drugged condition produced an entirely new attitude in the
subject. Instead of the customary deferential, almost
ingratiating approach there was now a confident
&quot;know-it-all&quot; manner. </p>

<p>The effects of marihuana ingestion on user and non-user were
essentially the same, as indicated by the findings in Table 14,
except that on the whole the alterations which did occur were
more marked for the non-user than for the user. Thus, for
example, while the average number of responses given by the user
increased only 11 per cent, those of the non-user rose 26 per
cent. Again, the user when drugged gave only 6 per cent fewer
whole answers as against a decrease of 15 per cent in the whole
responses of the non-user in the drugged state. The user showed a
29 per cent increase in small detail interpretations, the
non-user 31 per cent. There was only a 2 per cent drop in good
form interpretation by the user as against a 12 per cent drop for
the non-user. Only in the loss of popular interpretations did the
user exceed the non-user, his falling off being as great as 31
per cent as compared with 24 per cent for the non-user. While the
number of subjects in both groups was too small to allow of
definite statements, the trend seemed to indicate that the
ingestion or smoking of marihuana has a greater adverse or
disorganizing effect on the neophyte than on the experienced
smoker, again, as was the case in the study of mental
functioning, suggesting the possibility of psychological
habituation. </p>

<p>When the protocols obtained from these marihuana users in
their undrugged state are compared with those of the nonusers or
with the norms postulated for average adults of this age level,
certain deviating personality traits in these users may be noted.
The most striking deviation is the small percentage of users who
showed an extraversive personality. Only 15 per cent of the
marihuana users used in this study responded primarily to
emotional stimuli in the world about them as compared with 28 per
cent of the non-users. </p>

<p>While no definite figures are given in the literature for the
degree of extraversion in the general population, it seems
definitely more than 15 per cent. Altogether the personality
types among the non-users show a much more even distribution than
those among the users as seen in Table 15. Judging by the
personality types the majority of marihuana users lack social
ease and adroitness and are likely to find it difficult to make
good outgoing social contacts. </p>

<p>(TABLE 15) </p>

<p>Sixty-two per cent of the marihuana users' interpretations
were determined by the form or outline of the blot. Such
responses require an objective critical attitude unmodified by
emotional factors. However, when this attitude is maintained to
the point where more than 50 per cent of the answers are of this
nature the individual has a constricted affective life the degree
of constriction being in proportion to the increase in form
interpretations Thus, as was previously noted, there was more
than average emotional inhibition evident among the marihuana
users studied in this experiment. Since emotional inhibition
frequently causes intellectual constriction it is not surprising
to find that the stereotypy in these records was slightly above
expectancy, as indicated by the fact that 59 per cent of the
responses were animal or animal detail interpretations as
compared with a norm of from 25 to 50 per cent. </p>

<p>Finally the marihuana users (as well as the non-users in this
experiment) showed a depressive outlook in that more of their
responses were determined by the gray and black colors than by
the vivid colors. In interpreting this fact it must be borne in
mind that the subjects were all prisoners and their depressive
attitude may have been a reflection of their present situation
rather than of a basic trait. </p>

<p><b>Goodenough Test (Drawing of a Man)</b> </p>

<p>This test is helpful in studying each individual both in the
drugged and undrugged state, but group results are not meaningful
(except for one finding given below) because of a lack of
similarity both in the drawings obtained in the undrugged state
and in the direction of change which occurred after drug
ingestion or smoking. However, certain qualitative findings
proved interesting and are therefore reported here. In a number
of cases the identical drawing was produced in the undrugged, 2
cc., 5 cc., and cigarette state, but the size of the figure
increased consistently with the amount of marihuana taken. This
increase in size may have been a reflection of a physical
sensation induced by the drug, rnay have been due to a tendency
to macrographia which was noted in the writing of some subjects,
or may have been the psychological representation of increased
feelings of confidence and security. </p>

<p>With marihuana there was an increase in the percentage of
subjects who remembered to give their man ears. This again may
have been due to a heightened awareness of ears because of
physical or auditory sensations or might denote a greater
receptivity to what others have to say. </p>

<p>In some cases the amount of time consumed in execution of the
drawings was considerably greater when the subject was
&quot;high.&quot; This additional time was rarely used for
elaborating the picture but was caused by the subject's altered
mood. In many instances the laughter and joking in which he
indulged kept him from completing the job with dispatch. In other
cases depression or nausea slowed him up. Although aware of the
details which should be included, the subject was often satisfied
to indicate such items by a single line or dash rather than
discipline himself to the point where he could make a careful
picture. In some of these cases the drawing had attributes which
resemble the findings sometimes seen in productions of
individuals in a manic mood. </p>

<p>When a person is given a sheet of paper and is asked to draw a
man on it, the paper and the figure he draws become the situation
he must manipulate. If the figure is well centered so that the
finished product gives a balanced composition, the subject has
handled the circumstance in adequate fashion. The one consistent
finding for this test was the fact that the subject's ability to
handle situations was not improved by drug ingestion or smoking.
In the case of both user and non-user the percentage of balanced
compositions produced in the various drug states did not change
from the results obtained in the undrugged condition. It is,
however, interesting to note that 59 per cent of the marihuana
users made &quot;unbalanced&quot; drawings in the undrugged state
as compared with only 29 per cent of the non-users. It may be
inferred from this that fewer users than non-users are inclined
to come out into the center of the scene. This carries with it
implications of poor adjustment and insecurity. </p>

<p><b>Level of Aspiration Test</b> </p>

<p>In the undrugged state the majority of the subjects manifested
reactions which are usual in the experience of other experiments,
namely, the tendency to place their estimate just a little above
their actual performance. This was demonstrated by the fact that
while the average performance time needed for carrying out a set
task (putting sixteen blocks in a box, red side up) was 23.6
seconds, the subjects' average estimate for accomplishing this
was 21.9 seconds. As their performance improved with practice,
the subjects tended to allow themselves less time for the job.
Such statements as, &quot;I should do better this time,&quot; or
&quot;I'll take a chance,&quot; were not infrequent. Some
subjects wanted to know the best score ever made, and worked
energetically to attain it. </p>

<p>With 2 cc. of marihuana there was a slight increase in the
average estimated time for the entire group although there was no
concomitant increase in performance time. Under this dosage the
estimated time was 23.1 seconds, performance time 23.4 seconds.
Although the subject actually took no longer to do the job he
thought he would work more slowly and in predicting his
achievement gave himself more time. His attitude during the test
was a much easier, more happy go-lucky one. He occasionally
stopped in the middle of the experiment to discuss something with
the examiner or call out to someone passing in the hall. There
thus appeared to be a small loss in drive which, though not
revealed by significant statistical differences, was indicated by
the numerical trend and by the subject's attitude toward the
test. </p>

<p>After the ingestion of 5 cc. of marihuana the average
estimated time was 23.2 seconds and the performance time 24.4
seconds. Here the relationship between estimated and performance
time was similar to that found in the undrugged phase, that is,
there was a 1.2 second gap between them. During this drug phase
the subjects seemed less relaxed than they were under 2 cc., and
their main interest seemed to be to get back to bed and be left
undisturbed. </p>

<p>Under the influence of marihuana cigarettes the trend was
similar to that found with 2 cc., the difference between the
estimated time and the performance time being only 0.3 second. As
with 2 cc., subjects behavior was generally happy and relaxed. </p>

<p>When the group was divided into users and non-users the trend
was the same for both. </p>

<p>(TABLE 16) </p>

<p>On the whole it appears that small doses of marihuana and of
marihuana cigarettes tend to lower the individual level of
aspiration, that is, there is a slight lessening in the subject's
drive and his will to achieve. Larger doses (5 cc.) do not
produce this effect. </p>

<p><b>Frustration Test </b></p>

<p>The results of the frustration experiment indicated no
statistically significant differences between the subject's
reactions before and after he had taken marihuana. Again, after
the ingestion of marihuana there was a slight trend toward
lowering the level of aspiration (Table 17), but the over-all
change was not startling when compared with results on the Level
of Aspiration Test when no frustrating experience was introduced.
</p>

<p>(TABLE 17) </p>

<p><b>Binet Lines</b> </p>

<p>Binet's interpretation of this test was based upon the
principle that suggestible individuals, once embarked on a
particular form of activity (in this instance, drawing lines of
increasing length), ale more prone to continue this activity when
the stimulus is altered than are less suggestible people. Judging
by the results as given in Table 18, small doses of marihuana (2
cc. and cigarettes) induced thus type of perseverative behavior
in the users but not in the non- users. In other words, the
marihuana user when under the influence of the drug tended to
continue an activity he had started without being too
discriminatory or controlled about it. The non-user, on the other
hand, showed a curtailment in activity and responsiveness. One
possible explanation of this difference in effect on user and
non-user appears to lie in the fact that the drug made the user
more relaxed and easy-going and less controlled in motor activity
than he was in his undrugged state, while the non-user was often
more tense and disturbed. As was so often the case in the
personality tests, the effect on the user of large doses of the
drug (S cc.) was contrary to that of the small ones, probably
because in many cases he was made physically uncomfortable and
intellectually disorganized. </p>

<p>(TABLE 18) </p>

<p>The lack of consistency in the findings seems to suggest that
the individual's psychological and physiological &quot;set&quot;
toward the drug affects his reaction and behavior. Thus small
doses, which the marihuana user anticipates with pleasure make
him more easy-going and therefore probably more suggestible than
he would be in his undrugged state, while large doses have a
contrary effect. The non-user, on the other hand, appears to be
less suggestible as a result of drug ingestion than he ordinarily
is. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Wechsler Vocational Interest Blank</b> </p>

<p>The average number of positions chosen by the subjects when
they were in the undrugged state was 13.2. With 2 cc. of
marihuana the average was 12.9; with 5 cc., 12.7; and with
cigarettes, 11.8. There was a very slight but not statistically
significant trend toward a decrease in job interest. However, the
absence of any appreciable change in the number of positions
liked after the ingestion or smoking of marihuana indicates that
no real withdrawal is implied. </p>

<p>Analysis of the type of position chosen shows that under the
influence of marihuana there was no swing to the more feminine
occupations, but in the case of some subjects, especially
marihuana users, there was a falling off in the popularity of
some jobs which require considerable activity. For example, under
the influence of 2 cc. of marihuana or of marihuana cigarettes
the jobs of detective, policeman and taxi driver were found among
his least desired occupations though they were not in this place
when he was in the undrugged state. </p>

<p>The trend was the same for the user and the non-user in both
the drugged and undrugged phase. For the user the jobs of
aviator, gymnasium teacher, newspaper reporter, sailor and
soldier were most frequently chosen; for the non-user aviator,
doctor, explorer, forest ranger, newspaper reporter and prize
fighter were most popular. </p>

<p><b>Loofbourrow Personal Index: Test I</b> </p>

<p>Before taking marihuana, the user and non-user on an average
indicated familiarity with an identical number of words, 65.2.
After he had smoked marihuana cigarettes, the user's vocabulary
showed a gain of 6 words, the non-user's 5 words. In both cases
the subject's confidence in his verbal capacity was enhanced by
the use of marihuana.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Wechsler Free Association Test</b> </p>

<p>In the undrugged state the user and non-user were disturbed by
the same stimulus words, namely &quot;lonely,&quot;
&quot;passionate,&quot; &quot;insult,&quot; and &quot;sin.&quot;
The only differences were the disturbance the user showed in
response to the words &quot;wish&quot; and &quot;murder&quot; and
the delayed reaction of the non-user to the word
&quot;pity.&quot; </p>

<p>Under the influence of 5 cc. of marihuana or of marihuana
cigarettes the user was less disturbed by all these words with
the possible exception of &quot;insult,&quot; but there was a
sharp increase in the agitation aroused by the words
&quot;suicide&quot; and &quot;death.&quot; It appears that the
feeling of well-being produced by the drug tended to alleviate
the loneliness, guilt, and frustration which the subject felt,
but it was also accompanied by a fear of death. This may be tied
up with the anxiety the marihuana user always experiences in
regard to the amount of drug he is taking, the always present
fear of his &quot;blowing his top,&quot; or it may be a
reflection of the problems which were most disturbing to him. </p>

<p>The non-user, after taking marihuana, was also less disturbed
by the words &quot;lonely,&quot; &quot;passionate,&quot; and
&quot;sin.&quot; His reaction to &quot;pity&quot; was also
diminished but he, too, was still upset by the word
&quot;insult.&quot; The new disturbing stimulus words were not
those which upset the user but those which were more closely
related to his own immediate problems namely &quot;honest,&quot;
&quot;money,&quot; and &quot;sex.&quot; Since the non-user in our
group was generally an individual who had been sent to prison
because of stealing or a sex offense, it seems it was these
problems which the disinhibiting action of the drug brought to
the fore.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Pressey X-O Test</b> </p>

<p>This test was taken by only 10 subjects, 5 users and 5
nonusers. In general, the smoking of marihuana brought about some
increase in the number of words which had an unpleasant meaning
to the subject and in the number of things about which he had
worried. There was some decrease in the number of things for
which the drugged subject thought a person should be blamed. The
number of his associations with any one word remained roughly the
same in the drugged and undrugged state. </p>

<p>Although less inclined to censure when under the influence of
marihuana, the subject was nevertheless more readily disturbed
and worried. This undercurrent of irritability and anxiety seemed
to be a concomitant of the more obvious feeling of general
well-being which is the predominant effect of the drug. Two
possible explanations can be given here for this finding: the
physiological changes occurring with the smoking -of the drug
gave the subject a feeling of anxiety, and the disinhibition
which occurred at this time released the restraints which had
been imposed not only on the happier reactions but on all the
repressed unpleasantness as well, and things which the subject
had repressed because he wished to forget them now came to the
fore. This was noted when at least two of the subjects had
&quot;crying jags&quot; when drugged, reproaching themselves for
what they had done to their mothers and wives.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Downey Will-Temperament Test: Test I</b> </p>

<p>The changes in the subjects' responses on this test showed a
shift in their attitude toward themselves as a result of
marihuana ingestion. On the whole, more subjects appeared to
think better of themselves when they were &quot;high&quot; than
they did in their undrugged state. This is indicated by the fact
that there was an increase in the number of individuals who under
the influence of 5 cc. of marihuana or of marihuana cigarettes
believed themselves to be careful, cautious, ambitious, accurate,
industrious, impulsive, enthusiastic, and possessing superior
characters. There was also a decrease in the number who
considered themselves suggestible or extravagant. The only
negative traits which the subject admitted to more frequently
when he was &quot;high&quot; than he did in his normal state were
suggestibility, poor memory and aggression. The change in
attitude in regard to aggression was most striking among the
marihuana users, 88 per cent of whom considered themselves
aggressive after they had had the drug as compared with only 42
per cent in the undrugged state. This increase in the feeling of
aggression was not paralleled by the findings of the other tests
nor by the behavior of the subjects when they had taken the drug.
Like the increased vocabulary noted on the Loofbourrow it can
best be interpreted as an indication of the subject's increased
feelings of confidence and self-assurance. </p>

<p>(Table 19)<br>
</p>

<p>In general the changes which occurred on this test after the
subject had had marihuana were not consistent for the user and
the non-user or for different amounts of the drug. They merely
served to indicate that when the subject was under the influence
of marihuana there were shifts in his feelings about himself
which reflected a prevailing mood of confidence and self-
satisfaction. </p>

<p>Thematic Apperception Test </p>

<p>Without cigarettes the needs most frequently expressed in the
subjects' stories were &quot;affiliation,&quot;
&quot;aggression,&quot; &quot;sex,&quot; &quot;dominance,&quot;
&quot;succorance,&quot; &quot;self-abasement,&quot; and
&quot;play.&quot; These terms may be defined as follows:(1)
Affiliation: to be sociable, to make friends, to love.
Aggression: to fight, to criticize, to blame, to accuse or
ridicule maliciously, to injure or kill, sadism. Sex: to seek sex
objects, to court, to enjoy intercourse. Dominance: to influence
or control others, leadership. Succorance: to seek aid,
protection or sympathy. Selfabasement: to comply, to surrender,
to accept punishment, to apologize, to condone, to atone, to
depreciate ego, masochism. Play: to relax tension and alleviate
stress by pleasurable and humorously irresponsible activity,
motor, verbal or mental. </p>

<p>In general the frequency with which all needs were expressed
fell off after the subjects had smoked marihuana cigarettes. The
most striking drops were in the need for self-abasement and
aggression where the frequency of occurrence changed from 2.4 to
1.1 for the former, and from 2.7 to 1.7 for the latter. Contrary
to the general trend there was an increase in the need for
dominance. </p>

<p>When the subjects were not &quot;high&quot; the environmental
influences most frequently mentioned in their stories were
illness and death and accepting parents. After smoking marihuana
the general trend was similar to that noted for the
&quot;needs,&quot; that is there was a falling off in the
frequency with which the subjects used most of the concepts. </p>

<p>There was, however, no diminution in the number of times that
illness and death played a part in their tales, the average
number being 2.1 before smoking and 2.2 after smoking. Likewise
the awareness of restraint and imprisonment remained constant,
occurring 1.1 times before smoking and 1.2 after. Contrary to the
general trend there was an increased awareness of an accepting
love object. This concept appeared in the stories on an average
of .8 time before smoking and 1.2 after. </p>

<p>The decrease in the number of times both needs and
environmental pressures were expressed in the stories given after
the subjects had had cigarettes was not due to a curtailment in
the length of the story. The tales were often more wordy in the
drugged than in the undrugged state, but their length was
frequently due to embellishment and repetition, and there was
likely to be less meaningful material. In general the stories
obtained from the subjects after smoking indicated that they had
less capacity for expressing themselves directly and clearly, and
also less concern with self-abasement and aggression. As defined
on this test these needs represent a conflict between aggression
against the self and against others and appear to stem from
insecurity and feelings of guilt and inadequacy. In the drugged
state the subjects appeared less disturbed by this conflict and
had less need to harry themselves and others. They had a greater
need for dominance, a desire for leadership. This ties in with
the greater self-assurance demonstrated by other tests and with
the increased awareness of acceptance by a love object found on
this test. </p>

<p>It is interesting to note that these subjects showed no
falling off in their awareness of illness and death or of
restraint and imprisonment after smoking. The frequency of the
latter concept was undoubtedly related to their status as
prisoners, while the former ties in with the findings on the Free
Association Test where the word &quot;death&quot; remained a
disturbing factor even after marihuana had been smoked or
ingested. </p>

Clinic, February 1941. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>FINDINGS ON WOMEN SUBJECTS</b> </p>

<p>As in the case with the men, when the female subject was under
the influence of marihuana her basic personality structure did
not change and only some relatively superficial emotional
reactions were different. As a group, the women used in this
study showed a somewhat constricted personality, and this
constriction was not lessened when the subject was
&quot;high.&quot; The emotional reactions revealed in the
Rorschach Test showed that the subjects in this particular group
were primarily extraversive, and this remained unchanged after
the administration of marihuana. Again, like the men, when under
the influence of the drug the women lowered the achievement
levels they set for themselves. However, they did not show any
increased self-confidence as did the men, either by an increase
in the number of words they claimed to know in the Loofbourrow
Test or in their appraisal of themselves as indicated in the
Downey Will-Temperament Test. In general, the women exhibited a
loss of drive for participation in anything requiring effort.
This is inferred from their performance in the Level of
Aspiration Test, the Vocational Interest Blank, and the Binet
Lines Test, as well as from their behavior. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>BEHAVIOR DURING THE TEST PERIOD OF SUBJECTS UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF MARIHUANA</b> </p>

<p>The findings reported here have all been in terms of
objective, quantitative measures. Some effects of the drug,
observable during examinations, cannot be quantified but are
nevertheless important to the understanding of the drug action.
These effects were reflected in those reactions of the subjects
which were not directly related to the test situation Behavior
was somewhat different when the subject had ingested marihuana
concentrate than it was when he had taken the drug in cigarette
form. With pills gastrointestinal disturbances were more
pronounced and drowsiness and fatigue seemed greater and more
enduring. Some individuals were so overcome by fatigue that they
worked for a few seconds only, and then sat with their heads on
the table. If spoken to, they made a great effort to do the work
but rarely continued for very long. When summoned to take the
test, especially toward the end of the day when they were almost
invariably lying on their beds, the subjects were overcome with
fatigue and were aroused only with the greatest difficulty. In
some instances there was definite resentment of this disturbance
and the impression was that only the presence of the police
officer and all the implications in the prison set-up prevented a
definite refusal to continue cooperatively. With both pills and
cigarettes many of the men had difficulty in concentrating and
maintaining a fixed goal. Subjects often stared vacantly for long
periods and when addressed came back to the test with a start.
Many burst into uncontrollable laughter over a test which in
their undrugged state had evoked no merriment. The laughter
frequently affected the entire group and most markedly those who
had been given marihuana. </p>

<p>The behavior of the user and non-user with marihuana
cigarettes was somewhat different. The user was pleasantly
excited at the thought of smoking, selected his cigarettes with
the manner of a connoisseur, and criticized or praised the
product offered him. His smoking took on something of a
ritualistic ceremony and was done in a careful and prearranged
fashion which varied slightly from individual to individual. In
general the men first opened the end of the cigarette to examine
the marihuana, then wet the &quot;stick&quot; by inserting it in
their mouths to prevent the paper from burning too rapidly. When
the cigarette was ignited the men took several short puffs, at
the same time inhaling as much air as possible. This caused the
tip of the &quot;stick&quot; to glow and resulted in a succession
of low gasping sounds from the subject The smoke was retained as
long as possible, occasionally causing severe paroxysms of
coughing. Although eager to be &quot;high&quot; the user was
consistent in his fear of &quot;blowing his top,&quot; and there
was always a point beyond which no amount of talking or cajoling
could make them continue smoking. </p>

<p>As a rule, the user liked to smoke in company. He was
generally satisfied if one friend, a &quot;kick partner,&quot;
could be with him. To this friend he would explain his thoughts
and feelings which to the objective observer were very
superficial. In trying to make a point, and usually a minor one
at that, the user, when smoking, would talk on endlessly and soon
lose his goal. He cracked many &quot;jokes&quot; which were
uproariously funny to him. In some instances &quot;leaping&quot;
or involuntary jerking of the arms, head, shoulders or legs
occurred The subject described his sensations as floating,
leaping, rocking or most often as being &quot;in the
groove.&quot; He was obviously enjoying pleasant physical
sensations and wanted to be left to himself to lie on his bed,
listen to soft music and dream or carry on &quot;deep&quot;
conversations. The test questions were frequently called a
&quot;bring down&quot; in that they forced the subject to face
reality and abandon his pleasurable feelings. Several subjects
concurred in describing part of their drug experience as
comparable to the twilight state between sleeping and waking in
which the individual floats pleasantly and does not allow outside
stimuli to impinge. Just as strong extraneous sensations will
bring the sleeper face to face with reality, so the insistence of
the examiner that the subject perform certain tasks served to
destroy his general feeling of well-being. Aside from the test
situation any unpleasant circumstances can serve as a &quot;bring
down.&quot; This &quot;bring down&quot; apparently only results
in destroying the subject's pleasure but cannot do away with the
disadvantageous effect on intellectual functioning. </p>

<p>When testing was completed the subject generally lay on his
bed and dozed or listened to the radio. His drowsiness persisted
for many hours. </p>

<p>Most non-users approached the smoking with apprehension. They
were instructed by the users in the art of lighting and inhaling,
but they rarely cooperated to the fullest extent? though this was
undoubtedly unconscious on their part. </p>

<p>The effects of marihuana on the non-users were variable. A few
of them enjoyed the results so much that they claimed they would
continue to smoke whenever they had a chance. They described such
sensations as &quot;lying in fur,&quot; and &quot;floating in
space.&quot; Some became acutely nauseous and could not continue
with their work, while others experienced little or no change in
feeling, undoubtedly because they never smoked correctly. </p>

<p>When the subjects were &quot;high,&quot; particularly in the
case of the non- user, there was a general loss of inhibition and
lessening of many social restraints which had previously been
exercised. Thus, all the men talked much more freely, confronted
each other more directly, and manifested a state of well-being at
times amounting to euphoria. They were much more confiding?
talked spontaneously about love and sexual affairs, and in two
instances exposed themselves and masturbated. </p>

<p>Although there was an undeniable increase in overt sex
interest following the ingestion of marihuana, it seems probable
that this interest was not the result of direct sexual
stimulation but rather a manifestation of a falling off in
inhibiting factors. This sex interest seems to have been due
primarily to the fact that these men had been imprisoned for
varying periods and had not had access to women. It is not at all
certain that under free conditions or with different subjects
this behavior would have been manifested. In any case, the
behavior of these prisoners was more like that which any man
deprived of sexual activity for a long period of time would
display under a releasing stimulus and not at all like the
behavior shown at marihuana &quot;tea-pads.&quot;<br>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the influence of marihuana changes in personality as
shown by alterations in test performance are slight. They are not
statistically significant and indicate only tendencies or trends.
Moreover, the drug effect is not always in proportion to the
amount taken, nor are the changes consistently in one direction.
In many instances the effect of small doses (2 cc.) or of
marihuana cigarettes is the opposite of the effect of larger
doses (5 cc.) (2) </p>

<p>(2) While sufficient experimentation has not been made to
validate the finding, it should be noted that the personality
changes produced by 2 cc. or marihuana cigarettes are almost
always in agreement in contrast to the changes resulting from the
ingestion of 5 cc. The 2 cc. Dosage apparently more nearly
approximates the amount a person would take if left to his own
devices. </p>

<p>The personality changes observed when the subject is under the
influence of 2 cc. of marihuana or marihuana cigarettes
demonstrate that the subject experiences some reduction in drive,
less objectivity in evaluating situations, less aggression, more
self-confidence and a generally more favorable attitude toward
himself. These reactions can be ascribed to two main causes,
namely, an increased feeling of relaxation and disinhibition and
increased self-confidence. As the drug relaxes the subject, the
restraints which he normally imposes on himself are loosened and
he talks more freely than he does in his undrugged state. Things
which under ordinary circumstances he would not speak about are
now given expression. Metaphysical problems which in the
undrugged state he would be unwilling to discuss, sexual ideas he
would ordinarily hesitate to mention, jokes without point, are
all part of the oral stream released by the marihuana. </p>

<p>At the same time that he verbalizes more freely, there is a
reduction in the individual's critical faculty. This is probably
due both to the intellectual confusion produced by the drug and
to the less exacting attitude his feeling of relaxation induces.
He holds himself less rigidly to the standards of his undrugged
phase and does not drive himself to achieve. He is satisfied with
himself and willing to accept himself as he is. This
self-satisfaction undoubtedly helps produce the feeling of
self-confidence which allows the subject to come out more freely
in fields which he formerly avoided. This increased confidence
expresses itself primarily through oral rather than physical
channels. Physically the subject reports pleasant sensations of
&quot;drifting&quot; and &quot;floating&quot; and he allows
himself to become enveloped in a pleasant lassitude. </p>

<p>After the administration of larger doses of marihuana (5 cc.)
the pleasurable sensations appear to be outweighed by concomitant
feelings of anxiety'and, in some cases, of physical distress,
such as nausea. Under these circumstances, for many subjects
there is little increase in confidence but rather heightened
insecurity which precludes outgoing reactions and tends to evoke
generally negativistic attitudes to most stimuli. </p>

<p>It is important to note that neither the ingestion of
marihuana nor the smoking of marihuana cigarettes affects the
basic outlook of the individual except in a very few instances
and to a very slight degree. In general the subjects who are
withdrawn and introversive stay that way, those who are outgoing
remain so, and so on. Where changes occur the shift is so slight
as to be negligible. In other words reactions which are natively
alien to the individual cannot be induced by the ingestion or
smoking of the drug. </p>

<p>Although in most instances the effects of the drug are the
same for the user and the non-user, there are some differences
both in kind and extent. Where the effects for the two groups are
in the same direction they generally are more marked in the case
of the non-user. This is not unexpected in view of the non-user's
lack of habituation to the drug action. For the nonuser his
present experience is a strange, even hazardous one, and the
uncertainty and anxiety attendant upon this impairs the sense of
well-being which the drug produces in the user. Thus the non-user
frequently feels-less secure when he is &quot;high&quot; than he
does normally and is less well adjusted than he is in ordinary
circumstances. </p>

<p>When the productions of the undrugged marihuana user are
studied, certain personality traits which serve to differentiate
him from the non-user and from the &quot;average&quot; individual
can be discerned. As a group the marihuana users studied here
were either inhibited emotionally or turned in on themselves,
making little response to stimuli in the world about them. People
with this type of personality generally have difficulty adjusting
to others and are not at ease in social situations. This
withdrawal from social contacts apparently finds little
compensatory or sublimating activity elsewhere. These subjects
did not have a desire or urge to occupy themselves creatively in
a manner which might prove socially useful. They showed a
tendency to drift along in passive fashion and gave a good
portion of their attention to relatively unimportant matters.
These men were poorly adjusted, lonely and insecure. As indicated
by their history they seldom achieved good heterosexual
adjustment. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS </p>

<ol>
    <li>Under the influence of marihuana the basic personality
        structure of the individual does not change but some of
        the more superficial aspects of his behavior show
        alteration. </li>
    <li>With the use of marihuana the individual experiences
        increased feelings of relaxation, disinhibition and
        self-confidence. </li>
    <li>The new feeling of self-confidence induced by the drug
        expresses itself primarily through oral rather than
        through physical activity. There is some indication of a
        diminution in physical activity. </li>
    <li>The disinhibition which results from the use of marihuana
        releases what is latent in the individual's thoughts and
        emotions but does not evoke responses which would be
        totally alien to him in his undrugged state. </li>
    <li>Marihuana not only releases pleasant reactions but also
        feelings of anxiety. </li>
    <li>Individuals with a limited capacity for effective
        experience and who have difficulty in making social
        contacts are more likely to resort to marihuana than
        those more capable of outgoing responses. </li>

<p><b>Family and Community Ideologies</b> </p>

<p>Adolph G. Woltrnann, MA </p>

<p>At the outset of the study it seemed worth while to supplement
the quantitative data by some qualitative procedures of the
projective type which might throw light on the social reactions
of the individuals who were being studied. One of the methods
that has shown its possibilities, particularly in its use with
children, is the play technique in which the individual is
permitted to give free expression to some of his unconscious
motivations in a way that is not immediately apparent to him. The
limitation of this technique is the fact that it is highly
interpretive, but it has the advantage of permitting observations
of the subject's personality reactions in problem situations. </p>

<p>Such a study was accordingly carried out on 18 subjects in the
early part of the investigation. </p>

<p>METHOD </p>

<p>Two situations were studied: one, subsequently to be referred
to as the family set-up, in which toys were used to build an
apartment or home, and another, subsequently to be known as the
community set- up, in which a second variety of toys were used to
construct a town setting. </p>

<p>The Family Set-up </p>

<p>The equipment used in this part of the study consisted of a
box of household toys of the type available in the ten-cent
store, including beds, dressers, chairs, tables, sinks, a stove,
a bathtub, a wash basin, a piano, lamps, flower boxes, a
telephone, doll sets of a man, woman, boy, girl, and maid, and,
in addition, several small wooden slats which were intended to be
used as room partitions. </p>

<p>The box of toys and materials was presented to the subject
with the following directions: &quot;Here are a number of toys
which can be placed in such a manner that a house can be built
from them. You are supposed to be this doll (man). Go ahead and
build yourself a house or apartment. You may use as few or as
many toys as you wish. You may also make believe you are a
bachelor or a married man with or without a family.&quot; </p>

<p>The Community Set-up </p>

<p>In studying the community set-up the following items were
employed: eighteen wooden houses, trees, cars, trucks, fire
engines, an ambulance, a radio police car, a railroad train,
airplanes, and numerous figures representing men, women, and
children from different walks of life. All these toys were handed
to the subject at the same time with the instruction to build a
town or city. As in the family set-up, no further help or
suggestions were given. </p>

<p>The actual method of handling these materials allows for two
approaches. In the free method the subject is encouraged to play
with any toy and to create and act out any situation that the
nature of the toy suggests to him. No help, clues, or hints are
given. In the controlled methods either the subject is told to
create a specific pattern or his responses and reactions to a
predetermined particular situation are elicited. Both methods
were used in this study. </p>

<p>After the subject had completed either his family or his
community set-up and answered questions regarding certain
situations about which the examiner had questioned him the
following points were investigated: ( 1 ) subject's marital
status, both real and assumed; (2) type of home he built for
himself (number of rooms, type of furnishing); (3) subject's
assumed occupation; (4) monthly income and rent which he posited;
(S) his reaction to attempted burglary; (6) his reaction to his
wife's and his own infidelity; and (7) the attitude he would take
toward civic problems if given a position of responsibility such
as mayor. In addition, the examiner appraised the subject's
neatness and orderliness in his home and community setup. The
experiment was given first when the subject was undrugged and
then when he was under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p><b>FINDINGS</b> </p>

<p>Results were collated in terms of the type and frequency of
responses to different situations both before and after taking
marihuana and in terms of number of items (toys) employed in the
set- up, as, for example, in the case of the home situation, the
number of rooms the subject thought necessary for his apartment
and the amount of rent he thought he ought to pay and its
relation to the income he posited for himself; in the case of the
community set- up, the number of times the subject provided for
ambulances, firemen, and policemen; in the case of the subject's
reaction to burglary, whether he took a passive or a resistant
attitude toward the burglary and whether he assumed the burglar
had absconded with most of the property and so on; in the case of
his attitude toward his wife's adultery, whether he thought he
ought to divorce her or try for reconciliation; and, when the
subject was unfaithful, whether he thought his wife ought to
forgive his delinquency. </p>

<p>In most cases comparisons between responses or reactions
showed little difference in attitude before and after the
ingestion of marihuana and therefore it would not be too
profitable in this short summary of the work to present all the
data obtained. However, by way of illustrating the type of
material procured, the following tables are given: </p>

<p>(TABLE 20) </p>

<p>(TABLE 21) </p>

<p>The majority of the patients, though unmarried in real life,
assumed families and responsibilities in the play situation, and
in a free situation acted out family activities and ideologies.
These figures reveal that, on the average, the subjects when
under the influence of the drug tended to build apartments with
somewhat fewer rooms. The impression of the examiner was that
this was due primarily to the subject's desire to get through
with the task as quickly as possible in order to return to his
room to rest and sleep. </p>

<p>(TABLE 22) </p>

<p>A &quot;make-believe&quot; sickness or accident necessitating
the use of an ambulance was the most frequently observed play
pattern. When the subjects were under the influence of the drug
the incidence of the ambulance and the police was considerably
less than it was when they were in the undrugged state. </p>

<p>(TABLE 23) </p>

<p>The most frequent form of passive reaction to his wife's
infidelity was that the subject would pack up and leave home. The
aggressive reactions consisted of ordering the wife out of the
home in three instances, jailing the wife and lover in one
instance, throwing the wife out in one instance, killing the
lover but leaving the wife unmolested in one instance, and
beating up the lover and leaving the wife unharmed in one
instance. </p>

<p>The following are examples of subjects' responses to the
adultery situation. When he was facing the pretended situation
before taking marihuana, one subject immediately left his house,
borrowed money from his employer, and traveled to the West Coast.
After he arrived there he proceeded to drink and in due time
became a derelict on the Barbary Coast. When asked about his
children he said, &quot;That's closed with the rest of the
chapter. Let her ardent lover support the children. I take on an
assumed name. Others might get a divorce and custody of the
children but in my case my home life would be a closed
chapter.&quot; After the administration of marihuana he still
showed a passive attitude, but, having assumed the role of a
psychologist, he felt obliged to act accordingly. At first he
considered divorce action, but since that would deprive the
children of a home, he finally forgave his wife. Then he stopped
in his contemplations, looked at the examiner and said, &quot;Why
do I become altruistic? . . . That's beyond me . . . Maybe I
become a martyr . . . I commit an act of martyrdom.&quot; Another
subject, when in the undrugged condition, ordered his wife out of
the house and later divorced her. In the drugged state customary
procedures were reversed. The subject went to his parents and
remained passively at home while his mother unsuccessfully tried
to bring about a reconciliation. </p>

<p>The subject's attitude toward adultery did not change in the
drugged state. The data in Table 24 illustrate the fact that
ingestion of marihuana generally does not alter the subject's
basic attitude. </p>

<p>(TABLE 24) </p>

<p>Practically all the subjects approved of saloons. Gambling was
rejected because it deprives wives and children of money and
leads to trouble. A heavy loser may try to recoup his losses
through holdups, and fights and homicide may develop from
quarrels. Prostitution was condoned by about 5O per cent of the
subjects both before and after the ingestion of the drug, but the
use of marihuana was frowned upon more often when the subject was
undrugged than when he was in the drugged state. </p>

<p>(TABLE 25) </p>

<hr>

<p><b>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Eighteen subjects who participated in the marihuana study were
subjected to the play situation with the idea of seeing whether
the pattern of play or the ideas investigated were materially
altered in consequence of the ingestion of the marihuana. Among
the ideologies which were appraised were: (1) attitude toward
family set-up; (2) attitude toward different occupations; (3)
attitude toward income; (4) attitude toward situations ordinarily
calling for aggression, namely an attempted burglary of his home
and sexual infidelity on the part of his wife; (5) attitude
toward authority. </p>

<p>In general the subject's attitude toward family and community
ideologies as manifested in play did not change markedly as a
result of the ingestion of marihuana. The subjects (in play) were
not intolerant of infidelity or aggressive toward lawbreakers
either before or after the ingestion of marihuana. On the whole
the initial passive reactions already observed in other parts of
the study were likewise observed in the play situation
experiment. The only very definite change as a result of the
ingestion of marihuana was in their attitude toward the drug
itself. Without marihuana only 4 out of 14 subjects said they
would tolerate the sale of marihuana while after ingestion 8 of
them were in favor of this. </p>

<p>Another significant manifestation in the play situation
pertains to the construction of the community set-up. In general
the community was less orderly and well organized when the
subjects had had marihuana. It is probable that this poor
organization may be ascribed to the generally indifferent
attitude and lack of motor coordination already observed in the
more controlled studies. </p>

<p>On the whole, the experiment with play technique gave less
information as to the effect of marihuana on subjects than had
been hoped for. This may have been due to the incompleteness of
the method employed or possibly to the fact that this technique
is designed to give data about the basic personality of the
individual rather than such alterations in it as might be caused
by pharmacological agents.<br>

<p><b>LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>Comparison Between Users and Non-Users from the Standpoint of
Mental and Physical Deterioration </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A careful testing of the motor and sensory functions of the
nervous system was included in the general physical examination
of each subject. Of motor functions, reflex activity and muscular
response and coordination were determined; of sensory functions,
perception of touch, pain and temperature stimuli; of specialized
functions, taste, hearing and vision. In the eye, the corneal and
light reflexes were tested and a retinal examination was made. In
this neurological examination no pathological conditions were
found in any of the subjects. </p>

<p>In the psychiatric examination attention was paid to general
intelligence and knowledge in relation to the subject's
background, to relevancy of talk in conversation, to orientation
as to time, place and situation, to memory of past and recent
events, to ability in simple arithmetic, to judgment in reaching
decisions, and to the presence of abnormal mental content shown
by delusions, hallucinations, obsessions, and ideas of
persecution. There was no evidence of disordered cerebral
functioning in any of the group. </p>

<p>As would be expected, differences in grades of intelligence
and in orderliness in thinking and reasoning were noticeable. The
Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test was administered to a total of
60 male subjects, 40 marihuana users and 20 nonusers. The average
I.Q. for the user group was 96.7, range 70 to 124, and for the
non-user group the average I.Q. was 104.5, range 93 to 114. Both
groups may therefore be classified as of average intelligence. </p>

<p>When analyzed according to racial distribution the two groups
were even better equated intellectually than the total results
indicate. For the 28 white subjects examined (13 users and 15
non-users) the average I.Q. for the users was 106.1 range 77 to
124, and for the non-users the average I.Q. was 106.3, range 96
to 114. There were 24 Negro subjects, 19 users and 5 non-users.
The average I.Q. for the users was 92.6, range 70 to 112, while
for the non-users the average I.Q. was 98.8, range 93 to 101.
Although the non-users averaged 6.2 points higher than the users,
it must be taken into account that the number of Negro non-users
tested was small. In any event, the disparity in results would
not be considered significant.. The average I.Q. of the 2 Puerto
Rican users was 91.0, range 72 to 100. </p>

<p>Reports on mental deterioration due to toxic, organic or
psychotic factors as given in the literature reveal that in such
cases the individual scores on the Bellevue Adult Intelligence
Test show marked irregularity, depending upon the functions
involved in the deteriorative process. As a group, the marihuana
users tested in this study showed very even functioning, and what
little irregularity occurred can be explained on the basis of
language and racial factors. </p>

<p>The physical and psychiatric examinations were of a
qualitative rather than a quantitative nature. In the special
examinations and tests of organ and system function, quantitative
measurements were obtained for 17 marihuana users. These subjects
were selected for the reason that they had smoked marihuana for
the longest period of time. The figures for years of usage and
number of cigarettes smoked daily were taken from each subject's
statement. </p>

<p>Marihuana users accustomed to daily smoking for a period of
from two and a half to sixteen years showed no abnormal system
functioning which would differentiate them from the non-users. </p>

<p>There is definite evidence in this study that the marihuana
users were not inferior in intelligence to the general population
and that they had suffered no mental or physical deterioration as
a result of their use of the drug. Addiction and Tolerance </p>

<p>A drug addiction is characterized by a compelling urge to use
the drug for the prevention or relief of distressing mental and
physical disturbances which occur when the necessary dose is
delayed or omitted. A drug habit is also characterized by an urge
to use the drug, but this is not compelling. The abstinence
symptoms, which are expressions of nervous states, are not
particularly distressing and do not occur as long as the person's
attention is placed on other matters. </p>

<p>Drug tolerance in the narrower sense used here means that
larger doses than those originally used are required to bring
about the effects desired by the subject. In the case of
morphine, tolerance develops because of addiction, but in other
instances tolerance may be present without addiction and
addiction without tolerance. When both are present the matter
takes on greater importance because of the extremes to which the
addict goes to obtain the drug constantly and in increasing
quantities. </p>

<p>As our group of subjects included 48 users of marihuana,
opportunity was afforded for some conclusions concerning
marihuana addiction and tolerance. Practically all of our group
of users stated that they could and often did voluntarily stop
the smoking for a time without any undue disturbance from the
deprivation. In the sociologic study reported by Dr. Schoenfeld
it was found that smokers had no compelling urge for marihuana.
If &quot;reefers&quot; were not readily available there was no
special effort made to obtain them from known sources of supply.
Dr. Walter Bromberg, Psychiatrist-in-Charge, Psychiatric Clinic,
Court of General Sessions in New York, states: &quot;The fact
that offenders brought up on marihuana charges do not request
medical treatment on their incarceration (with its cessation of
drug supply) argues for the absence of with drawal symptoms.''(1)
From interviews with several hundred marihuana users he concludes
that true addiction was absent. </p>

<p>(1) Bromberg, W. &quot;Marihuana: a psychiatric study.&quot;
J.A.MA. 113:4, 1939.=20 </p>

<p>The evidence submitted here warrants the conclusion that as
far as New York City is concerned true addiction to marihuana
does not occur. </p>

<p>The evidence concerning acquired tolerance is less clear-cut
Tolerance develops during the periods when the drug is being
taken and accounts for the necessity of increasing the dosage to
bring about the desired effects. How long the tolerance persists
after the drug administration is stopped has not been definitely
established in any instance. </p>

<p>The statements of marihuana usage and time since stoppage
given by eight of our subjects are summarized in Table 26. (TABLE
26) </p>

<p>On one or more of the numerous occasions on which marihuana
was administered each of these subjects received what was
considered a minimal effective dose. One (J.B.) was given 1 cc.,
another (A.B.) 3 cc., the others 2 cc. In all instances the
customary physical effects, conjunctival injection, dilated and
sluggishly reacting pupils, tremors and ataxia, were observed.
With these doses the subjects also experienced the sensation
described as &quot;high.&quot; The only conclusion warranted here
is that if acquired tolerance does occur it persists for a
limited period only. </p>

<p>Further evidence, though indirect, was brought out by Dr.
Shoenfeld's investigation and by personal interviews with our 48
users. There is agreement in the statements that among users the
smoking of one or two cigarettes is sufficient to bring on the
effect known as &quot;high.&quot; When this state is reached the
user will not continue smoking for fear of becoming &quot;too
high.&quot; When the desired effects have passed off and the
smoker has &quot;come down,&quot; smoking one cigarette brings
the &quot;high&quot; effect on again. This could not be the case
had a steadily increasing tolerance developed. </p>

<p>The evidence available then=AD-the absence of any compelling
urge to use the drug, the absence of any distressing abstinence
symptoms, the statements that no increase in dosage is required
to repeat the desired effect in users-=ADjustifies the conclusion
that neither true addiction nor tolerance is found in marihuana
users. The continuation and the frequency of usage of marihuana,
as in the case of many other habit-forming substances, depend on
the easily controlled desires for its pleasurable effects.
Possible Therapeutic Applications </p>

<p>If a drug has well-marked pharmacological actions and low
toxicity, as appears to be the case with marihuana, a
consideration of special interest is its possible therapeutic
application. In the older clinical literature marihuana was
recommended for use in a wide variety of disorders, but in recent
years it has almost disappeared from the materia medica and it
was dropped from the United States Pharmacopeia twenty years ago.
</p>

<p>In view of the laboratory and clinical findings obtained in
this study the question of the therapeutic possibilities of the
drug was considered. Marihuana possesses two qualities which
suggest that it might have useful actions in man. The first is
the typical euphoria- producing action which might be applicable
in the treatment of various types of mental depression- the
second is the rather unique property which results in the
stimulation of appetite. In the light of this evidence and in
view of the fact that there is a lack of any substantial
indication of dependence on the drug, it was reasoned that
marihuana might be useful in alleviating the withdrawal symptoms
in drug addicts. </p>

<p>At the Riker's Island Penitentiary observations were made on
56 inmates who were addicted to morphine or heroin. Two groups
were selected, the addicts in each being matched with those in
the other group as to age, physical condition, duration and
intensity of habit, and number of previous attempts at cure. The
subjects in one group received no treatment or were given
Magendie's solution according to the usual hospital regimen while
those in the other group were treated with 15 mg. of
tetrahydrocannabinol three times daily with or without placebo
(subcutaneous water injection). An attempt was made to evaluate
the severity of the withdrawal signs and symptoms. The impression
was gained that those who received tetrahydrocannabinol had less
severe withdrawal symptoms and left the hospital at the end of
the treatment period in better condition than those who received
no treatment or who were treated with Magendie's solution. The
ones in the former group maintained their appetite and in some
cases actually gained weight during the withdrawal period. </p>

<p>Since psychological factors play a large part in the
withdrawal symptoms of at least a certain proportion of morphine
addicts, there are grounds for the assumption that a drug having
the properties of marihuana might be of aid in alleviating mental
distress during the withdrawal period. However, the studies here
described were not sufficiently complete to establish the value
of such treatment, and before conclusions can be drawn the
problem must be investigated under completely controlled
conditions. PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY (1) S. Loewe, MD (2) (1) From
the Department of Pharrnacology, CorneU University Medical
College. (2) Part of the experimental work here reported was
conducted in collaboration with W. Modell SUMMARY </p>

<p>1. This review of the pharmacology of marihuana is centered
around the chemical and pharmacological identification of the
active principles of hemp. Coordination of chemical and
pharmacological investigations as a prerequisite to success in
the search for unknown principles and of the analysis of the
structure-activity relationship of these compounds is discussed. </p>

<p>2. In a survey of the sources of preparations with marihuana
activity, hemp seeds are disclosed as a heretofore unknown source
of active substances. </p>

<p>3. Varieties of hemp can be distinguished according to
genotypic differences of the content of active principles which
persist over generations independently of soil and climate. </p>

<p>4. The pharmacological actions of marihuana are analyzed with
regard to their specificity and their usefulness as indicators of
specific components. </p>

<p>5. Sixty-five substances from the new class of cannabinols and
related classes are reviewed, among which are the essential
components of the marihuana-active hemp oils. The discovery of
this class, the synthesis of these representatives, and their
structural elucidation led the way to the discovery of the active
substances. </p>

<p>6. Quantitative assay procedures are described for the most
important marihuana effects that are observed in the animal
experiment. The assay of the ataxia effect in the dog and of the
synergistic hypnotic effect in the mouse with refined procedures
are shown to be reliable expedients for measuring these two
marihuana actions, whereas the areflexia effect in rabbits failed
to show the reproducibility required for quantitative purposes. </p>

<p>7. With the aid of these methods the natural
tetrahydrocannabinols are shown to be active principles
responsible for ataxia in dogs and psychic action in man. They
are intermediate products between the two ineffective substances
which compose the bulk of hemp oil: a labile excretion product of
the plant, cannabidiol, and a stable end- product, cannabinol.
The conversion of cannabidol into active tetrahydrocannabinol by
a natural environmental influence has been paralleled by
ultraviolet irradiation in vitro. </p>

<p>8. Numerous isomers, homologs and analogs of tetra- and
hexahydrocannabinol are shown to possess the specific marihuana
action. The potency varies enormously and is highest in natural,
optically active=ADlaevogyrous=ADtetrahydrocannabinols. </p>

<p>9. The significance of many of the structural details of the
tetrahydrocannabinol molecule for marihuana activity is
elucidated by quantitative determinations of relative potency.
Special attention was devoted to a study of the importance of
variations in the length of the 3- alkyl side chain of
tetrahydrocannabinols. In studying methyl to nonyl homologs of
the original amyl derivative occurring in nature, it was found
that the maximum potency is not at the amyl, but at the hexyl
homolog, and in two out of four homologous series at the
representatives with still longer side chains. </p>

<p>10. In addition to the ataxia and the psychic action, other
pharmacological attributes of the tetrahydrocannabinols are a
decrease in the respiratory and an increase in the pulse rates in
the non-narcotized dog. </p>

<p>11. The synergistic hypnotic action of marihuana in the mouse
is to be attributed to the otherwise inert cannabidiol. </p>

<p>12. The corneal areflexia action in the rabbit was much
stronger in impure distillate oils than in pure tetrahydrocan

<p><font size="3">Soma and the Wootton Report</font></p>

<p><font size="3">by Steve Abrams</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;In 1967 my organization Soma published a
full paged advertisement in The Times which called for reform of
the law on cannabis. Sixty-five people were persuaded to sign
this document, including leading figures in the arts and sciences
and eminent medical men. our proposals for reform stopped short
of outright legalization. However, legalization was clearly a
long term prospect if they were implemented. The advertisement
declared the existing law &quot;immoral in principle and
unworkable in practice.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The advertisement was immediately debated in
the House of Commons, where the Minister of State, Alice Bacon,
announced an expert inquiry headed by Baroness Wootton of
Abinger. In January 1969 the so-called &quot;Wootton Report&quot;
on Cannabis endorsed the position taken in the advertisement,
that &quot;the long asserted dangers of cannabis were
exaggerated, and that the related law was socially damaging, if
not unworkable.&quot;* The Home Secretary of the day, James
Callaghan (now Lord Callaghan) put up a smokescreen. He denounced
the Report, claiming its authors had been
&quot;overinfluenced&quot; by the &quot;lobby&quot; responsible
for &quot;that notorious advertisement.&quot; However, after
waiting for a year, he quietly introduced legislation to
implement the recommendations of the Wootton Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The legislation expired with the 1970 general
election, but it was immediately reintroduced by the Tory
government and became law as the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The
law implemented the unanimous view of the Advisory Committee on
Drug Dependence that end users of cannabis should no longer face
the prospect of imprisonment. This was spelled out by the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, in his advice to magistrates on
sentencing. After a prolonged debate Britain had decided to
condone the use of cannabis. Today the law is scarcely enforced
against end users, and the majority of arrests are dealt with by
the procedure of cautioning, without a conviction being
recorded.**&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*Home Office Advisory Committee on Drug
Dependence - Report on Cannabis, 1968, p. 1</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;** &quot;The law banning cannabis sale
and use is all but unenforced.&quot; Times leader, &quot;Overdue
for Repeal&quot;, 24 July 1992&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This interpretation of the history of cannabis
law reform has been consistently denied in the media.* A full
paged article in The Independent on July 22, 1992
(&quot;Twenty-five years gone up in smoke&quot;) was summarised:
&quot;On the 24th July 1967 sixty-five of the famous liberal
great and good signed an advertisement in The Times calling for
cannabis to be legalized and ... nothing happened.&quot; Lord
Deedes, writing in The Telegraph on December 15, 1992 said the
same thing about the Wootton Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The last public debate on the subject took
    place in 1969, when Baroness Wootton, then chairman of a
    sub-committee of the Government's advisory body, recommended
    a lightening of penalties for possession of cannabis. As a
    member of the same body, I remember that I thought her
    arguments persuasive but politically unattainable. We
    discussed this amicably until Jim Callaghan, the Home
    Secretary, denounced her proposals in the House of Commons,
    and that was that.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Lord Deedes is at least willing to admit the
existence of the Wootton Report. However, when Lady Wootton died
in 1988, at the age of 91, the work for which she was best known
was not considered worthy of mention in obituaries, notably in
The Independent and the Guardian.** The Telegraph was the only
newspaper which got it right:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">In 1967 her Report on soft drugs caused a
    considerable furore by its recommendation of more lenient
    sentences for offences involving cannabis, and was dismissed
    patronizingly by James Callaghan as &quot;overinfluenced by a
    lobby in favour of legalizing pot.&quot; In 1970, however,
    Callaghan introduced legislation broadly in line with the
    Wootton proposals.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The press celebrated the twentieth anniversary
of many trivial events of the 'sixties, but there does not seem
to have been a single reference in 1989 to the controversy which
dominated the news in January and February 1969. When a long
television interview with Lady Wootton was shown posthumously,
the subject of drugs was not raised, but a voice-over made the
astonishing claim that &quot;in the 'sixties she campaigned for
the legalization of cannabis.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*The Times did, finally, print a letter from me
on 24 July 1992. It is interesting to compare this letter with
another which Rees-Mogg refused to print in February 1969. That
letter in included in my article. &quot;Cannabis Law Reform in
Britain&quot; in The Marijuana Papers by David Soloman, Penguin
Books, 1970, pp. 69-79 (UK edition only).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;** So far as I know, the Wootton Report
has never been mentioned in The Independent. The authors of the
page published on July 22, 1992, Dina Rabinovich, Emily Greene
and Andrew Brown, listed forty events following on after the
advertisement but pointedly ignored the existence of the Report
and the reduction in penalties under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;In a letter to the Times on February 5th,
1969 in the aftermath of the Parliamentary debate on the Wootton
Report, Lady Wootton and the Chairman of the Advisory Committee,
Sir Edward Wayne, noted that none of the members of the
sub-committee supported the legalization of cannabis. On the
Sunday following publication of the Report, Lady Wootton said in
an article in The Sunday Times : &quot;Even those who wanted to
legalize (cannabis), even the people who signed the Times
advertisement, admit that immediate legalization is not
practical.&quot;*</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report did contemplate the eventual
legalization of cannabis, but the so-called &quot;cannabis
lobby&quot; refused to jump the gun. The 1969 Prospectus of the
Soma Research Association, Ltd. said:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">A Soma delegation gave oral evidence to the
    sub-committee. We took the view that prohibition appeared to
    be an ineffective and socially damaging method of controlling
    the misuse of cannabis. However, we argued that realistic
    decisions about the long term control and possible
    legalization of cannabis could not be made on the basis of
    existing knowledge. Additional research was required, but
    could not be undertaken because the law prohibited research
    in which cannabis was smoked.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The advertisement said, &quot;The Government
ought to welcome and encourage research into all aspects of
cannabis smoking, but according to the law as it stands, no one
is permitted to smoke cannabis under any circumstances, and
exceptions cannot be made for scientific or medical
research.&quot; Lady Wootton made the same point in her Sunday
Times article: &quot;People have not been able to undertake
serious research because smoking is forbidden on all
premises.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Research was prohibited because it was an
offence to have charge of premises where cannabis was smoked. The
liability was absolute; guilty knowledge was not required. No
exceptions were judged possible. Cannabis could not even be
smoked by a machine on government premises. The law contained a
term which made it impossible to challenge its own premisses of
the harmfulness of cannabis smoking.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The advertisement asserted that cannabis was
&quot;the least dangerous of pleasure-giving drugs.&quot; The
argument was rehearsed at some length, and those persuaded by it
might well have been inclined to experiment. It came close to
saying that the main danger of cannabis smoking was the prospect
of being arrested. But any criticism of an unjust law is likely
to breed disrespect for the law. The text said, &quot;The
prohibition of cannabis has brought the law into disrepute and
has demoralized police officers faced with the necessity of
enforcing an unjust law.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;* Barbara Wootton, &quot;Time and the
Drug Scene,&quot; Sunday Times, 12 January 1969.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the 1967 Tory party conference, the Shadow
Home Secretary, Quintin Hogg (now Lord Hailsham), denounced the
organizers and signatories of the Soma advertisement. He said
that the editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg (now Lord
Rees-Mogg), would never live down the scandal caused by its
publication. Hogg was &quot;profoundly shocked by the
irresponsibility of those who wanted to change the law. Their
arguments were &quot;casuistic, confused, sophistical and
immature:&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">There is no half-way house in this matter.
    There can be no encouraging the drug up to a point. You
    either sell it over the counter or in the shops or you
    prohibit it altogether.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Rees-Mogg replied in a Times leader, &quot;The
Right to Dissent,&quot; on October 23rd:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;We believe that people who want to
    change the law have a right to put their case to the public.
    We do not accept advertisements from people who want to break
    the law. But there is a vital difference between wanting the
    law to be broken and wanting it to be changed. ... Mr. Hogg
    thinks that the subject of drugs is so dangerous that free
    discussion cannot be allowed, that those who disagree with
    him have no right to be heard. Our view would be that his
    rhetorical approach is more likely to repel than to
    persuade.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">In January 1969, following publication of the
Wootton Report, Hogg wrote in the Daily Express that it was
necessary to &quot;pursue the addicts of hashish and marijuana
with the utmost severity the law allows.&quot; When the report
was debated in Parliament, on the 27th of January, Hogg insisted
that cannabis was a dangerous addictive drug, the cause of
madness and mayhem. He opposed any reduction in the maximum
penalty of ten years' imprisonment because, in this event,
&quot;the conclusion drawn by the public, by traffickers in the
drug and by potential victims of it would be that the government
were on their way to legalizing its use.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The penalties under the Dangerous Drugs Act did
not distinguish between supply and use. The maximum penalties
were one year on summary conviction and ten years on inditement.
Reducing the penalties for possession of cannabis would involve
putting down the maximum penalty on summary conviction to six
months or less. This would mean, in practice, that users of
cannabis would no longer face the prospect of imprisonment. The
main deterrent to consumption would thus be removed and use would
increase. The stigma of a criminal conviction would soon be
lessened. The police would no longer have much incentive to
enforce the law and in due course they would be unable to enforce
it. Finally, legalization would come, after a generation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The issue of cannabis law reform was raised at
a crucial time. In 1967 the drug laws were in disarray. The
Dangerous Drugs Act applied to drugs controlled under the UN
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, namely heroin, cocaine and
cannabis, including their derivatives and analogues. Amphetamine
and LSD were subject to more moderate penalties under the Drugs
(Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964. LSD had only just become illegal
and barbiturates were not controlled at all. Meanwhile some
cannabis users were punished more severely than heroin users.
Cannabis smoking was regarded as a crime but heroin addiction was
treated as an illness. Doctors had the right to prescribe heroin.
The Court might send a cannabis smoker to prison and send a
heroin user to a doctor.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The formation of Soma was announced in an
article published in Cherwell, the Oxford student newspaper, on
February 1st, 1967. The national press became involved in a
controversy about the prevalence of cannabis at Oxford, arising
out of an article by myself in an anthology, The Book 21 Grass,
edited by George Andrews and Simon Vinkenoog.* The publisher sold
the &quot;story&quot; to The People, who brought&nbsp;it out in
two inch headlines on January 29th. This article was quoted at
length by President Clinton's drugs adviser, Professor Norman
Grinspoon in his book, Marihuana Reconsidered (Harvard University
Press, 1971; pp. 311-312. It was also described in the Times
Literary Supplement (June 15th, 1967) as &quot;a sane and
balanced piece of writing that does much to implement the ...
view that harm rather than good is done by the existing state of
the law.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*&nbsp;&quot;The Oxford Scene and the
Law&quot;, The Book of Grass, Peter Owen 1967, pp. 235-42</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Following a press conference on February 2nd to
launch the Book of Grass, an article by Peter Fiddick appeared in
The Guardian, prophetically entitled, &quot;Pot lobby moves into
gear.&quot; (February 3rd) Follow up articles, debating the
prevalence of cannabis smoking at Oxford, appeared The Times, The
Telegraph and the Guardian. There were also several articles in
The Oxford Mail, and the story dominated Cherwell (then edited by
Julian Norridge) for the remainder of the term.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The page one lead in Cherwell was accompanied
by a double paged spread, &quot;The Pot Plot&quot;, a kind of dry
run for the Times advertisement which served as a fact sheet for
the media. &quot;The Pot Plot&quot; was noticed by the popular
press. &quot;Smoke more pot. It's safer than beer,&quot; wrote
Arthur Smith in the Daily Mirror on January 31st. &quot;Make it
legal to take marihuana urges Oxford student&quot; was the
heading for an article in the Mail the following day by Nicholas
Lloyd (former Cherwell editor, now Sir Nicholas, editor of the
Daily Express). On the 6th of February I took part in a
television discussion with the Chief Constable of Oxford C. G.
Burroughs and a psychiatrist from the Littlemore Hospital, Dr.
O'Gorman, on the television program &quot;Today&quot;, from
Birmingham.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the same day, The Telegraph printed the
following letter from me:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">May I make myself clear? Drug addiction is
    extremely rare within the University of Oxford. I do not know
    of any resident member of the University who is addicted to
    narcotics such as heroin and cocaine. There are probably a
    number of addicts to amphetamines and barbiturates, drugs
    which are widely and indiscriminately prescribed under the
    National Health Service.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">There is no reason to believe that the
    widespread use of cannabis (marijuana or hashish or hemp)
    constitutes a problem at the University. Cannabis is
    nonaddictive and there have been no cases at Oxford of
    disorderly behaviour attributable to its influence. The
    consensus of informed medical opinion is that cannabis is
    probably less harmful than alcohol.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The civil authorities and the press have
    indiscriminately confused the non-addictive and relatively
    harmless herb cannabis with addictive and harmful drugs such
    as amphetamines and heroin. When challenged on this point
    they argue that cannabis is indirectly harmful because its
    use leads to heroin addiction.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">There is little or no evidence in support
    of this view. One might as well argue that sex leads to
    prostitution. The effects of cannabis and heroin are opposite
    in character. Heroin users are disturbed individuals who need
    to escape from reality; cannabis has the effect of enhancing
    reality.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">My qualified estimate that five per cent of
    Oxford students use cannabis when it is available has been
    challenged by authorities who have a strong vested interest
    in minimising the extent of the situation. Students go out of
    their way to conceal information from these authorities, but
    they go out of their way to reveal information to me.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">My estimate was based on four years direct
    observation, in the course of which I observed hundreds of
    people smoking and conducted and cross-checked many careful
    interviews. Perhaps I have sources of information which are
    unavailable to the Chief Constable, the proctors and various
    anonymous university officials.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">*&nbsp;According to press reports, &quot;money
changed hands for The People article.&quot; Cf. &quot;Our Man in
Fleet Street&quot;, Drugs and Society, vol. 1, no. 3 (December
1971, pp. 34-35) and the response, a letter from me, in vol. 1,
no. 4, January 1972, p. 37 I was not paid. I had no contract with
the publisher, who sold the story without my permission and
against my protests, which are documented.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I had been playing the numbers game. Five per
cent of junior members of the university translates to five
hundred Oxford students. I felt no compunction about using the
image of the University to challenge the traditional stereotype
of the anti-social drug taker. Following publication of the
People lead, an article in The Times said that my claim that
&quot;at least 500 undergraduates and a few dozen dons&quot;
smoke pot &quot;has been rejected by police, proctors and
dons.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Times quoted the view of the Senior
Proctor, Dr. Robin Fletcher, that my figures were &quot;grossly
exaggerated.&quot; : &quot;The article could create a very bad
image of the University. It is unfortunate for a number of
reasons.&quot; A similar article in The Telegraph quoted the view
of &quot;a senior member of the university who is concerned with
investigations into student health problems&quot; : &quot;I would
be surprised if the number of people using drugs habitually in
the University is more than about twenty.&quot; This official was
presumably D. C. M. Yardley, (now Local Ombudsman) who was Dr.
Fletcher's predecessor. The Telegraph stated that Dr. Yardley had
led an investigation of undergraduate drug use the preceding year
and concluded that no more than fifty students were involved. No
more than thirty took drugs with any degree of regularity. In the
Cherwell lead on February 1st, Dr. Yardley's view of the danger
of cannabis is quoted: &quot;The nervous system of regular pot
smokers is shot to bits. They are mental wrecks.&quot; In The
People he is quoted: &quot;All but those with the strongest minds
will end up seeking bigger and better 'kicks' from heroin and
like drugs. Within the university and nationally, any move to
bring about the acceptance of hemp must be fought.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The matter was resolved by the University
Committee on Student Health, which included several heads of
colleges. I was invited to give evidence to the Committee on
February 15th. They accepted my claim that as many as five
hundred undergraduates had used cannabis. I made the point that
the problem was hardly confined to Oxford and asked the Committee
to press the Home Secretary to institute a government inquiry
into the status of cannabis and LSD. The Chairman of the
Committee was the Head of my college, St. Catherine's, Alan
Bullock (now Lord Bullock, formerly Vice Chancellor of the
University). He told me that my suggestion that the University
press for a Home Office inquiry had been accepted and invited me
to assist him in drafting the letter to this effect, which was
sent to the then Vice Chancellor, Kenenth Turpin on February
28th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The first account of the Student Health Report
appeared in a Cherwell exclusive on the 1st of March. On the same
day things looked as if they might be getting out of hand.
Cherwell had announced a &quot;happening&quot; in Wellington
Square, sponsored by International Times. It was to be filmed for
German television. John Hopkins, the organizer, promised to
provide Suzie Creamcheese of the &quot;Mothers of Invention&quot;
pop group on a white horse. The front page of the Oxford Mail for
March 2nd has a photo of hundreds of students pouring out of
Balliol College and another of them marching along the High.
There were signs and banners with legends such as &quot;Death
penalty for pot&quot; and &quot;God moves in a mysterious
way.&quot; The Deputy Chief Constable stated that &quot;more than
500 students disorganized the city centre for over two
hours.&quot;*&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Oxford Mail account says that the police
tried to clear Wellington Square, whereupon the
&quot;happening&quot; reformed as a procession down St. John's
Street. They moved straight across Beaumont Street and St. Giles,
without pausing for traffic, in through Balliol College back
entrance (where the police could not follow) and out again
through the front entrance in Broad Street. The procession
continued on through the Turl and the High to Carfax. The
&quot;happening&quot; was also covered in the national press. The
Sun called attention to six undergraduates tied together with a
plastic rope crawling along the High Street, insisting they were
climbing a mountain. The Sun also remarked on the presence of a
girl on horseback carrying a sign which said, &quot;Free Suzie
Creamcheese!&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Report of the Committee on Student Health
was published on April 3rd and reviewed in The Times the
following day. The Times article says, &quot;At the Health
Committee's suggestion, the Vice Chancellor of Oxford University,
Mr. K. C. Turpin, is to ask the Home Secretary for an urgent
national enquiry into the dangers of drug taking.&quot; It said
the university was concerned at the numbers which might be
experimenting with cannabis. The following article by Nicholas
Lloyd appeared in the Daily Mail:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The pot takers. 500 Oxford students use
    marijuana&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">About 500 Oxford undergraduates smoke
    marijuana,, says a committee of dons. The Committee was set
    up to report on the health of students at the university. In
    a letter to Kenneth Turpin, the Vice Chancellor, it say that
    an independent claim that about five per cent of the 10,000
    students take drugs is probably correct.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">But it maintains that the situation at
    Oxford is not exceptional and that a similar proportion of
    students at other universities take drugs. The committee,
    headed by Mr. Alan Bullock, Master of St. Catherine's
    College, says that drug taking is a national problem. It
    calls for a full investigation into the effects of different
    drugs and says that public policy could then be based on
    scientific fact instead of prejudice.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">On Tuesday students at St. Catherine's
    College passed a motion by 24 votes to 4 in favour of making
    marijuana - known as 'pot' - legally available.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;* In fact the numbers were swelled
because students from the Oxford Polytechnic, in their &quot;rag
week&quot;, joined the proceedings.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 7th of April, the Home secretary, Roy
Jenkins, announced the appointment of an investigation led by
Baroness Wootton. She was to head a &quot;sub-committee on
hallucinogens&quot; of the Advisory Council on Drug Dependence,
appointed in December 1966, enacting a recommendation of the
Second Brain Report the previous year.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We hoped for something earth shaking from the
Wootton Committee. We hoped for a published report on cannabis
that would bear comparison with the New York Mayor's Report on
Marihuana (the La Guardia Report) of 1944 and the East Indian
Hemp Drugs Report of 1893-94. The first stage of the campaign had
been concluded.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The chain of events leading to the appearance
of the advertisement involved an interaction with the affairs of
the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and the so-called
&quot;underground.&quot; One of the reasons for raising the
subject of cannabis with urgency in the favourable context of its
use at Oxford was the need to combat what a Times leader (&quot;A
Dangerous Press Camapign&quot;) soon called &quot;the deliberate
sensationalism that underlines the present campaign against
&quot;drugs.&quot; The Soma advertisement said &quot;The crime at
issue is not drug abuse but heresy.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Traditionally, the use of cannabis had been
largely confined to Blacks, Indians and Arabs.* Muslims broadly
tolerated the use of cannabis but prohibited alcohol, which is,
literally, sacred to Christians, and also to Jews. The new rock
music could be represented as a fusion of black rhythms and
Eastern spirituality. The gentle undulations of the music were
also explicitly sexual. For decades the Americans, in particular,
had portrayed the use of cannabis as degenerate.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The News of the World replied to the article in
the People by accusing the Rolling Stones of abusing drugs.
(February 3rd) The same night Mick Jagger appeared with Hogg on
the Eamon Andrews talk show. Jagger told Hogg that he too had
been to university, and seemed to get he better of him. Then, I
thought, he got above himself and announced, impulsively, that he
would sue the News of the World for libel. The newspaper panicked
and went to the Scotland Yard Drug Squad. The head of the Drug
Squad, Chief Inspector Lynch later told me that he refused to
act. He said that he was not expected to stamp out cannabis, but
to keep its use under control. If he arrested Mick Jagger every
lad in the country would want to try some pot. He was, after all,
head of the drug squad, not head of the Lynch mob.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* The statistics published with the Wootton
Report show that 1964, the first year in which white offenders
outnumbered blacks, was also the first year in which a minority
(48 per cent) of cannabis offenders were sent to prison.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As is well known, the News of the World had
more success with the local police in West Wittering, where Keith
Richards lived. In the subsequent trial, Jagger's counsel,
Michael Havers (later Lord Havers, also Mrs. Thatcher's attorney
general in the &quot;Spycatcher&quot; case) alleged that the
newspaper used an agent provocateur. The arrests were made on
February 12th, but the story did not break until the 19th. Only
the Telegraph named those arrested, Keith Richards, charged with
the absolute offence of permitting premises to be used for
smoking cannabis, and Mick Jagger, charged with possession of
amphetamine. George Harrison has said that the Beatles were at
the party that was raided, but the police waited until they
left.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Perhaps the beginning of the entire sequence of
events was the arrest on cannabis charges on December 30th 1966
of the aforementioned John Hopkins (Hoppy), a member of the
editorial board of the underground newspaper &quot;International
Times.&quot;* The &quot;underground&quot; was a literary and
artistic avant garde with a large contingent from Oxford and
Cambridge. Hoppy, for example, was trained as a physicist at
Cambridge. The underground had found an enemy in Lord Goodman,
Chairman of the Arts Council, who went over the head of the Home
Secretary, Roy Jenkins, and appealed directly to the Director of
Public Prosecutions to mount a police raid on the Indica bookshop
where International Times was edited.** Goodman had an animus
against (Barry) Miles, co-proprietor of the bookshop with Peter
Asher, and also a member of the Editorial Board of IT. In
December 1966 Eric Whitte nominated Miles to serve on the Arts
Council Literary Advisory Panel. Goodman had been infuriated when
his appointment was announced to the press on January 30th, and
had him thrown off.***&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Hoppy, who was on bail, organized the greatest
of the underground events, the &quot;24 Hour Technicolour
Dream&quot; at Alexandra Palace on April 29th, to raise funds for
the defence of the paper. When his trial came up, he insisted on
pleading not guilty though he had no defence. He had a previous
conviction for possession of cannabis but insisted on a jury
trial, which meant going before a judge of the Crown Court and
risking a longer sentence than one year. Hoppy completed a
classical recipe for self-imprisonment by lecturing the court on
the need to legalize cannabis. Sentencing him to nine months
imprisonment on June 1st, the Deputy Chairman of Inner London
Sessions, A. Gordon Friend, said:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">I have just heard what your views are on
    the possession of cannabis and the smoking of it. This is not
    a matter I can overlook - You are a pest to society.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">* Lord Thompson, proprietor of The Times,
obtained an injunction to stop the use of the word
&quot;Times&quot; in the title. The paper then became
&quot;IT&quot; until Max Handley restored its correct name in the
mid seventies. Incidently the girl in the logo is not Clara Bow.
Its Theda Bara.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;** According to Tom Driberg.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*** Peter Fryer - &quot;A Map of the
Underground&quot;, Encounter, October 1967, pp. 9-10</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;A sympathetic account of the case
was published by Clive Goodwin in Tribune and Christopher Logue
contributed a poem &quot;For John Hopkins, imprisoned in
Wandsworth Jail&quot;, which appeared in the New Statesman on
July 7th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The next day, June 2nd, Hoppy's friends met at
Indica. I raised my idea of advertising in The Times.* Miles said
he thought he knew where the money might be found. He had been to
school with his partner, Peter Asher, who was half of the pop duo
&quot;Peter and Gordon&quot;, a &quot;one-hit wonder.&quot; Peter
Asher's sister, Jane, was Paul McCartney's girlfriend. McCartney
had several times contributed small sums to keep IT going. By the
end of the day he had offered to guarantee the cost of the
advertisement, which was #1800.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I was not as surprised as I might have been at
this turn of events. I had gone to the meeting thinking about the
plight of the Beatles and their record company, EMI. &quot;Sgt
Pepper&quot; had been officially released the preceding day. I
had purchased a copy from the HMV Shop in Notting Hill on the
27th of May and had been listening to it continuously. Earlier in
the year the single Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane suggested that
the Beatles had become enthusiastic proponents of LSD. &quot;Sgt
Pepper&quot; reinforced this impression. McCartney had also given
an ill-advised interview to Life magazine. The Beatles had
&quot;pissed&quot; on their clean image as explicitly as the
Rolling Stones had &quot;pissed&quot; on a garage forecourt in
June 1965.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The establishment was ready to send the Rolling
Stones to prison. Now it looked as if the Beatles would be next.
Something had to be done to get them off the hook. Nobody wanted
them arrested, but it was difficult to see an alternative. I
proposed, in effect, to change the issue from LSD to pot and to
associate the Beatles with leading figures in the arts and
sciences in a legitimate protest from 'within the system.' It is
not in any way surprising that McCartney was willing to back the
advertisement or that Rees-Mogg was willing to publish it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;I went along with Miles to discuss the
project with McCartney. Unless my memory is playing tricks on me,
McCartney thrust a copy of Sergent Pepper into my hands and said,
&quot;Listen to it through headphones on acid.&quot; The
conversation that followed was, however, sedate. McCartney was
well aware of the power of public statements coming from the
Beatles. He realized that if they spoke out on too many issues,
their influence would be diluted. But pot was going to be an
exception. McCartney said that the Beatles and their manager
Brian Epstein would all put their names to the advertisement and
he agreed that the project would be left entirely in my hands. He
hoped that his participation in the funding could be kept quiet.
It came to the attention of the Evening Standard the next day. I
received a call from the Diary, from Max Hastings or Julian
Norridge translated from Cherwell. &quot;How could you possibly
know?&quot; I asked. The source, I was immediately told, was the
editor, Charles Wintour.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Later I spoke to McCartney on the phone. We
agreed that Phillip Oates could say in his first
&quot;Atticus&quot; in the Sunday Times (eventually published on
July 9th) that all four Beatles would be among those contributing
to the cost of the advertisement. Then, on the eve of
publication, when I attended The Times to inspect the proofs, the
advertising manager, R. Grant Davidson, got cold feet.
Publication had been delayed for a week whilst he checked all the
names. Now he asked for payment in advance. I rang the only
person I had met in the Beatles organization, Peter Brown of the
music publishing company, Northern Music (NEMS). He sent round
his personal cheque for #1800. Someone later told me that he had
been reimbursed from a Beatles advertising account. Probably none
of the Beatles was out of pocket.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As the advertising manager's caution indicates,
the publication of the advertisement was a near thing. The
deciding factor in persuading the Times to publish and the
Beatles to meet the cost was probably the sensational case of the
Rolling Stones, which began on the 27th of June. The verdicts
came on Thursday the 30th. Richards was sentenced to a year in
prison on the premises charge and Jagger was given three months
for possession of four amphetamine tablets known as 'black
bombers.' Both were first offenders. They were released on bail
the following day.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">That night there was a spontaneous
demonstration outside the News of the World building in Fleet
street. No one had cared enough to demonstrate in Fleet Street
since the first world war, and no one would ever care enough to
do so again. The police turned dogs on the demonstrators and six
people were arrested. The demonstrations continued into the early
hours of the morning. The next day, Richards and Jagger were
released on bail. It being Friday, the members of the underground
club, UFO, over a thousand persons in extravagant dress, marched
at midnight from Tottenham, Court Road to the statue of Eros at
Piccadilly Circus, where they were joined by several hundred
members of other West End clubs. I remember Pat Arrowsmith of CND
wringing her hands in anguish, being quite unable to comprehend
our tactics.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We then formed up and marched to Fleet Street.
Again the police turned dogs against us, and one demonstrator was
bitten. On Saturday the News of the World demonstrations
continued for the third night running. A picture of part of the
crowd, myself among them, appeared on the front page of the News
of the World. Mick Farren, a future editor of IT and lead singer
of the Social Deviants, was beaten by the police and a number of
others were arrested, including Suzie Creamcheese.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Rees-Mogg's celebrated leading article,
&quot;Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?&quot; appeared in The
Times on the same day, Saturday the 1st of July. My admiration
for it is subject to qualification. The editor did not address
the issue squarely. He was moved by the spectacle of Jagger in
handcuffs, but said nothing at all about the twelve months
sentence meted out to Keith Richards, who was convicted of being
in control of premises used for the purpose of cannabis smoking.
The leader did not question the justice of this charge, which was
an &quot;absolute&quot; offence that did not require guilty
knowledge on the part of the offender. Rees-Mogg did not mention
cannabis at all.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The last &quot;event&quot; preceding
publication of the Times advertisement was the famous
&quot;Legalize Pot Rally&quot; at Speakers Corner in Hyde Park on
Sunday the 16th of July. This was one of a series of
&quot;be-ins&quot; which had been taking place at monthly
intervals at Primrose Hill and Hampstead Heath. &quot;Vast
publicity for legalize pot rally. Steve Abrams appears on
television with amazing regularity,&quot; wrote International
Times. In the event, several thousand people turned up, many
wearing flowers and bells and many smoking pot openly. Most of
the national newspapers gave &quot;flower power&quot; a double
paged spread the next day.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I presided at the meeting and introduced Alan
Ginsberg. When a policeman asked him to stop playing his
harmonium, which went against the by-laws, he was filmed giving
the policeman a flower. I decided to break up the meeting into
small groups. I remember Stokely Carmichael, Alexis Korner,
Carolyn Coon, Spike Hawkins, Clive Goodwin and Adrian Mitchell
speaking simultaneously, each mounted on a soap-box and
surrounded by a few hundred people. I was surprised to findmy
remarks used in a schools program on &quot;The Right to
Protest&quot; that seemed to be repeated on television most
afternoons. Everyone had a good time in Hyde Park. No one was
arrested. We had struck another blow against the image of the
unkempt and violent drug addict. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The aim of the advertisement was to influence
the Wootton subcommittee on hallucinogens. They had restricted
themselves to pharmacological and medical studies on both
cannabis and LSD. We wanted them to report on cannabis alone, to
emphasize the social aspect of its use and to make specific
recommendations for law reform.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Crude attempts were made to discredit the
professional competence of the sub-committee. Following
publication of the Report on Cannabis, Quintin Hogg was quoted in
The Times, on January 9th, 1969: &quot;A less suitable committee
is impossible to imagine. Half the subcommittee are doctors and
there is not a judge, or anybody practising at the criminal bar,
among them.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The eleven members of the sub-committee were K.
J. Barraclough, a stipendiary magistrate and Chairman of the
Poisons Board; Dr. Thomas Bewley, a psychiatrist in charge of the
addiction clinic at Tooting Bec Hospital, the Secretary and later
President of the Society for the Study of Addiction; Peter
Brodie, Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard in charge of the
C.I.D., also Vice President of Interpol; Dr. P. H. Connell, a
psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital; Dr. J. D. P. Graham,
professor of pharmacology; Dr. C. R. B. Joyce, Head of the
Department of Pharmacology at London Hospital Medical College,
later Director of Research at Ciba, Switzerland; Sir Aubrey
Lewis, Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry at the Maudsley; Dr.
Nicholas Malleson, a psychiatrist, Reader in Student Problems and
Head of Student Health at London University, also the most
experienced LSD therapist in Britain; H. W. Palmer of the Glaxo
Pharmaceuticals Company; Timothy Raison, Editor of New Society,
later Tory MP, Minister of State for Home Affairs; Michael
Schofield, a sociologist who had conducted several studies for
the Home Office; and Baroness Wootton, a distinguished social
scientist, a serving magistrate, Governor of the BBC, veteran of
several Royal Commissions.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I decided that Dr. Malleson was the key member
of the subcommittee. Had it been a jury, he would probably have
been the foreman. I approached him and offered to rewrite the
text of the advertisemnt until it satisfied him. In return, I
asked to use his name privately in soliciting signatures. I had
met Michael Schofield as a fellow member of the committee
preparing a Report on Drugs and Civil Liberties for the National
Council on Civil Liberties (NCCL). I asked him to sign the
advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The sub-committee met 17 times between April
1967 and July 1968. At the first meeting the plan was to report
to the main committee in October. The report was to be restricted
in scope and to treat both cannabis and LSD. Before the
advertisement appeared, the committee limited its enquiries to
pharmacological and medical questions.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">According to Michael Schofield, the
sub-committee were not favourably disposed to begin with. At the
first meeting one member said that research was not necessary and
that all the sub-committee had to do was to work out ways to
&quot;stop the spread of this filthy habit.&quot; During the
early meetings, six members wanted to take a hard line, four were
undecided and two felt that the penalties for possession were too
severe.* The two liberals were probably Schofield and Malleson.
It follows that Lady Wootton took some persuading.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If there was a consensus of informed medical
opinion on cannabis, the sub-committee would have to recognize
it. The important thing was to do what could be done to persuade
them to report on cannabis alone and to broaden the scope of
their enquiry, to give proper consideration to the social aspects
of cannabis use and to make specific recommendations for law
reform. My endeavour in the text of the advertisement was to
define the issues for a public debate.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The debate began immediately. The advertisement
was mentioned in Parliament on the day of its appearance. Four
days later, the headlines were about the savage sentence of five
years' imprisonment and a 10,000 fine or an extra year which
Judge Argyle passed on a black man charged with
&quot;possession&quot; of cannabis. He did this, he said to
express his disapproval of the Soma advertisement.** He also
claimed that 69 of 70 heroin addicts in Birmingham had
&quot;started on cannabis.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the same day, Friday the 28th, the Soma
advertisement was the subject of an adjournment debate in the
House of Commons proposed by Paul Channon. The Minister of State,
Alice Bacon (Later Baroness Bacon), claimed that 97 per cent of
heroin addicts known to the Home Office had &quot;started on
cannabis.&quot; She seems to have invented this figure. Her
speech was racist in tone and credited cannabis and LSD with the
importation of negro music and Indian spirituality. She compared
McCartney unfavourably with a now forgotten singer called
&quot;Lulu.&quot; However, she said that the issues raised in the
advertisement would be considered by the Wootton sub-committee,
and she committed the Government to taking their Report into
consideration in framing new legislation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Michael Schofield - The Strange Case of Pot,
Pelican Books, 1971. Schofield has a chapter about
&quot;Reactions to the Wootton Report&quot; but he ignores
Callaghan's assertion that the sub-committee had been
&quot;overinfluenced&quot; by the &quot;lobby&quot; responsible
for the Soma advertisement. He also fails to mention the fact
that he was a signatory to the advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">** The man was regarded by the Court as a major
supplier. Press reports did not specify the quantity of cannabis
found in his possession. The sentence was reduced on
appeal.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In this debate William Deedes outdid himself.
He was under the illusion that hashish is far more dangerous than
marijuana.&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Does anyone believe that if we were to end
    the black market in cannabis leaf by legalizing it, a black
    market in resin would not begin. That could undermine the
    nation. That is why I believe that those who sign public
    announcements assume very grave responsibilities unless they
    can back what they say with more knowledge than most of
    us,believe we have.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Tom Driberg, who signed the Soma advertisement,
read from his father's evidence to the East Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission in 1892. I briefed Driberg and Channon and got to sit
in the strangers box on the floor of the house during the debate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On Monday the 31st of July, a week following
the publication of the advertisement, the conviction of Keith
Richards was quashed and Jagger's prison sentence (for possession
of amphetamine tablets) was reduced to a conditional discharge.
The Soma advertisement had asked for the abolition of the
premises offence and included a plea for the release of all those
imprisoned for possession of cannabis.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Soma was an informal organization when the
advertisement appeared. Later, it was incorporated as the Soma
Research Association, Ltd. There was a very distinguished Board
of Directors, including the most eminent living scientist,
Francis Crick, F.R.S., who won a Nobel prize for his discovery
with James Watson of the structure of DNA. The Board included
four psychiatrists: Professor Norman Zinberg of Harvard, whose
experiment published in 1968 was the first authorised by the US
government and became the strongest affirmation of the relatively
harmless character of cannabis smoking; Dr. Anthony Storr, a
leading establishment figure and author; Dr. R. D. Laing, the
leading radical analyst of the day; and his colleague at the
Philadelphia Association, Dr. David Cooper. The other directors
were The Revd. Kenneth Leech, the leading authority on drug abuse
within the Church of England, an early advocate of the
&quot;legalization&quot; of cannabis; Francis Huxley, the Oxford
anthropologist, and myself. Cooper, Crick, Huxley, Laing and
Storr were signatories to the advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Soma had five employees, including Don Aitken,
the Secretary and Archivist; Derek Blackburn, Psychologist; and
Adam Parker-Rhodes, Pharmacologist. Premises were at 438, Fulham
Road, SW6 and 4, Camden High Street, NW1. Soma had active
research and medical programs, the latter in collaboration with
the doctors at an affiliated NHS surgery in Notting Hill. Dr. Ian
Dunbar was Medical Director of Soma and Dr. Sam Hutt was Medical
Correspondent. Aitken and Blackburn prepared a bibliography of
cannabis. We did the first human experiments with the active
principle of cannabis, tetrahydracannabinol (THC), synthesized in
our laboratory. We compared the action of the isomers of THC and
tried to distinguish euphoria from intoxication by measuring the
apparent tridimensionality of visual perception, the extent to
which the world appeared, as it were,
&quot;spaced-out.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We could work with THC because its structure
had not been determined when the Dangerous Drugs Act was last
revised. It had not been placed under UN control. Before we made
THC, we obtained supplies of a purified form of cannabis, the
alcoholic extract, which was made available on prescription.
Extracts and tinctures of cannabis had been removed from the
Pharmacopoeia but were still listed in the
Extrapharmacopoeia.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Dunbar wrote a prescription for me on the
18th of August 1967. I finally encashed it at an obscure branch
of Boots in the East End. The prescription came with a letter
that said: &quot;This is an historical document. I suggest you
frame it.&quot; Later a pop group, the Aynesley Dunbar
Retaliation brought out a famous LP called &quot;Dr. Dunbar's
Prescription.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I put it to the Home Office Drugs Branch that
most of the distinguished signatories to the advertisement and
many of those who commented on it had openly declared their use
of cannabis. For example, the following paragraph ended a letter
to The Guardian published on July 8th and shown on television in
&quot;What the Papers Say&quot; :&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">... If anyone remains unconvinced by this
    mass of expert advice then I can only offer them the evidence
    of my own experience having smoked marijuana for many years
    without ill effects whatsoever.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p><font size="3">Yours faithfully</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">Clive Goodwin</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">79 Cromwell Road</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">London SW7</font></p>
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;The Home Office obtained a legal opinion
that the part of the law which made it an absolute offence to
keep premises for the purposes of cannabis smoking did not apply
to the smoking of purified cannabis; that is to say, smoking
preparations based on &quot;extract of cannabis,&quot; BPC. An
approach was then made to the UN drugs control apparatus, who
increased the nominal UK quota of cannabis imports from 15 kilos
per annum to 254 kilos. (Five hundredweight) Ganja was imported
from India and made up by the botanical firm, Ransoms of Hitchen.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One of the early debates was a seventy minute
television special on September 1st, 1967, a mock trial in the
series &quot;Your Witness&quot; in which Sir John Foster, Q.C.
was to argue the case for cannabis against Leon Brittan. Sir John
dropped out and was replaced by Jonathan Aitken, a signatory to
the advertisement (now a minister in the Government).* Aitken
proposed to call me as a witness. I had in mind smoking pot as I
gave evidence and presented myself for cross examination. The BBC
researcher, Esther Rantzen, agreed that this would be good
television, and so I approached Dr. Dunbar for the first
prescription.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Sir John was at a meeting at the House of
Commons in June at which he, Jonathan Aitken, Humphry Berkeley,
Tom Driberg and Brian Walden all agreed to sign the
advertisement. He later atoned for withdrawing from the
advertisement and the debate by joining Soma. Indeed, he sent
along his friend Princess Feuzy, who was a subject in our
research program.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Leon Brittan was fully aware that
extracts and tinctures were controlled separately from cannabis
and cannabis resin and that the prohibition on the use of
premises for smoking cannabis did not apply to these purified
forms. However, he was also aware that my live appearance would
undermine his case. He therefore fudged the issue and insisted
that if I appeared the BBC would be liable to prosecution. It was
compromise in the end. I was not permitted to appear live, but
the BBC filmed me smoking at home, passing any risk onto my
landlord. The corporation thus obtained some stock film that was
reused a number of times.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 10th of October, 1967 Jonathan Aitken
and I successfully argued a cannabis law reform motion against
Professor Francis Camps and Robert Pitman at the London Hospital
Medical College. The next day The Telegraph reported the warning
that Professor Camps had given about the alleged dangers of
cannabis, without noting the fact that his opinion had been
rejected by a large audience of doctors and medical students.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I came up against Professor Camps again at a
conference on drugs of the Student Humanist Federation at
Nottingham University on January 5th to 7th, 1968. The problem
was to get in the way of the newspapers reporting his remarks. My
solution was to announce at the beginning of my talk that I would
be speaking under the influence of a prescribed form of cannabis.
The Times, The Telegraph and The Guardian reported this event as
if it had been a high wire act.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 21st of November 1967, I had spoken
against Leon Brittan at a Teach In at Guys Hospital. I did not
like his arrogance or his willingness to pontificate on a subject
of which he knew nothing. Fate was kind to me. After the
publication of the Wootton Report in 1969, I had a unique
opportunity to flatten him. We debated the Report at Bristol
University. Leon Brittan recalled the &quot;Your Witness&quot;
television program. He told the Bristol Union I had insisted on
being filmed at home because I knew I could not speak in public
under the influence of cannabis. I rose to my feet, Leon Brittan
gave way. I turned to the president of the Union, and being
advised that smoking was permitted, I resumed my seat, removed an
enormous joint from my pocket and lit up. I went through an
elaborate pantomime to distract the audience during his speech. I
pretended to be &quot;zonked.&quot; Then it was my turn to speak.
I was in my best form, and I think the Union voted unanimously
for the motion. Afterward, Brittan refused to believe I had been
smoking. He said I had pretended to inhale.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Inevitably, the debate that gave me the
greatest satisfaction was at the Oxford Union on October 19th,
1967. In my article in &quot;The Book of Grass&quot; I had said
that the one place in Oxford where cannabis was not smoked was
the Union society. Now, just months later, the Union voted in
favour of changing the law. Dr. Laing and I were opposed by Ann
Mallalieu and the Revd. John McNicoll. William Paton, the
Professor of Pharmacology, spoke against cannabis from the floor,
Earlier in the evening a motion of censure was passed against the
Proctors, who had suspended Cherwell because of its coverage of
drugs. Dr. Yardley spoke from the floor in this debate. He and I
had threshed out this matter on the television program &quot;24
Hours&quot; on the 11th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">During the Thatcher period, every attempt was
made to blame the permissive society&quot; of the 1960s on the
political left. In fact, the left was left out, at least in 1967.
Cannabis was a libertarian issue which became very popular with
the Young Conservatives. When I spoke at a teach-in organized by
the Young Communists League, I faced a hostile audience for the
first time. Speaker after speaker rose to say that cannabis was a
capitalist plot. I was &quot;intent on distracting&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">the workers from their revolutionary
duties.&quot; John McNicoll, who also spoke in this debate, had
accused me, in the Evening Standard diary, of being a
crypto-communist. He said I had taken up drugs when lecturing at
Leningrad University. Now, with a delicious political instinct,
he accused me of being an American. In a long interview with
Penthouse magazine, published in December 1968, I said that
though Tariq Ali and Clive Goodman had signed the Soma
advertisement, &quot;We want nothing to do with their
revolution.&quot; I added: &quot;You can't smoke
Marxism.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I think the decisive event in the debate about
cannabis may have been a meeting of the Society for the Study of
Addiction at the premises of the British Medical Association on
November 7th 1967. The press were barred from this meeting, which
was attended by officials from the Home Office, senior police
officers, most of the Advisory Committee and many of the leading
medical authorities. Dr. Storr and I spoke on behalf of Soma. We
were opposed by Dr. Cedric Wilson of Liverpool University, who
made a great fool of himself by including gangrene among the
symptoms of chronic abuse of cannabis. He also repeated the claim
made by William Deedes in the House of Commons on 28 July, that
there were seven million hashish addicts in Egypt and that the
Government there was at its wits end to know what to do about it.
I quoted an article published the preceding year in the U.N.
Bulletin on Narcotics, a study sponsored by the Egyptian
government, which said there were 180,000 &quot;habitues&quot; of
cannabis in Egypt and that a study of matched groups of users and
non-users did not reveal any significant differences between the
groups.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The discussion from the floor was the important
part of the meeting. One expert after another rose to affirm the
innocuous status of cannabis. They seemed to vie with one another
in devising new arguments. It may not have reached the height of
a religious revival, but I was left with the feeling that a
consensus had been realized, that the Djinn was well out of the
bottle.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In November 1967 the reforming Home Secretary,
Roy Jenkins, exchanged places with James Callaghan, the disgraced
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had devalued the pound. In
opposition, Callaghan had been the paid Parliamentary lobbyist
for the police federation. He was &quot;Sunny Jim, the
policeman's friend.&quot; His agenda was not that of the Labour
party; indeed, it is difficult to find a more destructive
influence in the history of that party. Through his opposition to
vital trade union reforms, his failure at the Treasury and his
pointing up what he called the &quot;permissive society&quot; as
the legacy of his predecessor at the Home Office, he probably
cost Labour the 1970 general election. Later his incompetence as
prime minister cost Labour the 1979 election, and in 1983 and
1987 he intervened against his own party because of his
opposition to nuclear disarmament.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Jenkins defended the non-partisan social
reforms of the decade and insisted that Britain was a
&quot;civilized society,&quot; rather than a permissive one.* I
recall taking part in a Third Program discussion of perhaps
unprecedented length (from 8:45 pm until past midnight)
on&nbsp;November 9th, 1969, in which Warden Sparrow of All Souls,
Michael Foot, Professor Alasdair MacIntyre (a signatory to the
advertisement) and I discussed the question, &quot;Is Britain
Civilized.&quot; Bernard Levin was in the Chair. I am now
inclined to the view that Britain has over the past quarter
century become intolerant of dissent and especially of
dissenters, that it has many and various means of denying them
the &quot;oxygen of publicity&quot;, so that the question might
seem to be not whether Britain is a &quot;civilized&quot;
society, but whether, as a prime minister seemed to imply, it
aspires to be a &quot;society&quot; at all.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Transport House distributed the text of
Jenkins' remarks to the Abingdon Constituency Labour Party on
July 19th, 1969 </font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the Home Office, Callaghan was intent on
salvaging his popular reputation, and happy to take the low road.
He made known his opposition to the Wootton Report. He made a
number of public interventions which could be interpreted as
attempts to sabotage the Report, or to dictate terms to the
Committee. He was not obliged to publish the Report, formally
submitted to him on November 1st, 1968 and he must have realized
that the publication of an expert report which exonerated
cannabis would do everything to undermine the existing
legislation, since it virtually said that the only reason to
refrain from smoking cannabis was the fact that it remained,
&quot;for the time being,&quot; illegal. There were reports in
the papers that some members of the Committee were prepared to
resign if the Report was not published. I was myself
contemplating a pirated edition of the Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Printed copies of the Wootton Report were
delivered before Christmas and distributed on January 7th, 1969.
The press were advised that Callaghan intended to denounce the
findings and recommendations of the Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report went further than the Soma
advertisement in affirming the relative harmlessness of cannabis.
An often quoted summary (paragraph 29) allied the conclusions of
the Wootton Report with those of the great reports of 1893 and
1944:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Having reviewed all the material available
    to us we find ourselves in agreement with the conclusions
    reached by the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission appointed by the
    Government of India (1893-4) and the New York Mayor's
    Committee on Marihuana (1944) that &quot;the long term
    consumption of cannabis in moderate doses has no harmful
    effects.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Paragraph 67, introducing the Section on
General Conclusion and Recommendations states:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;The evidence before us shows that:</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">An increasing number of people, mainly
    young, in all classes of society are experimenting with this
    drug, and substantial numbers use it regularly for social
    pleasure.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">There is no evidence that this activity is
    causing violent crime or aggressive anti-social behaviour, or
    is producing in otherwise normal people conditions of
    dependence or psychosis, requiring medical treatment.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The experience of many other countries is
    that once it is established cannabis-smoking tends to spread.
    In some parts of Western society where interest in
    mood-altering drugs is growing, there are indications that it
    may become a functional equivalent of alcohol.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;In spite of the threat of severe
    penalties and considerable effort at enforcement the use of
    cannabis in the United Kingdom does not appear to be
    diminishing. There is a body of opinion that criticises the
    present legislative treatment of cannabis on the ground that
    it exaggerates the dangers of the drug and needlessly
    interferes with civil liberty.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The Committee proposed that new legislation be
drafted that would distinguish between hard and soft drugs and
between drug trafficking and drug taking. It proposed that the
penalties for cannabis be reduced to the point where minor
offences would not merit imprisonment. The key recommendation was
to reduce the maximum penalty on summary conviction for
possession to four months imprisonment. The committee also
proposed to abolish absolute offences (i.e., the liability in
respect to the use of premises) and called for a legal framework
for cannabis research and medical treatment using cannabis and
its variants.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Government's expert advisors had confirmed
the apparently surreal assertions of the cannabis lobby. This
completely knocked the pins from under any attempt to enforce or
justify the law. It discharged the burden of proof that the
&quot;cannabis lobby&quot; had assumed. Whatever was said against
us could also be said against the Advisory Council and against
Callaghan, who had not been bound to publish the Report. The
terms of the debate were now changed. If the Government wanted to
send people to prison for smoking cannabis, they had to show that
its use was harmful and socially damaging. But the further step
of legalizing cannabis depended on amassing proof, over a period
of time, that cannabis was not a social menace.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Report went out of its way to credit the
influence of the Times advertisement. I quote from an article in
the Guardian diary which was planted with a view to facilitating
Callaghan's denunciation of the Report. It was a set up,
illustrated by a photograph.&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Soft Sell&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">LOBBYISTS are the great unseen, the great
    unhonoured, not least by Government enquiries. But Steve
    Abrams' pot-boilers have never been that kind of lobby, and
    the Wootton Committee isn't that kind of enquiry. The
    Cannabis report out this morning delivers a rare and specific
    testimonial:&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;Our first enquiries were proceeding -
    without publicity - into the pharmacological and medical
    aspects when other developments gave our study new and much
    increased significance. An advertisement in the Times on the
    24th of July 1967 represented that the long asserted dangers
    of cannabis were exaggerated and that the related law was
    socially damaging, if not unworkable. This was followed by a
    wave of debate about these issues in Parliament, the Press
    and elsewhere, and reports of enquiries e.g. by the National
    Council for Civil Liberties. This publicity made more
    explicit the nature of some current &quot;protest&quot; about
    official policy on drugs; defined more clearly some of the
    main issues in our study; and led us to give greater
    attention to the legal aspects of the problem. Government
    spokesmen made it clear that any future development of policy
    on cannabis would have to take account of the Advisory
    Committee's report. Accordingly, we decided to give first
    priority to presenting our views on cannabis.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Publication of the Wootton Report provoked an
organized campaign of vilification in the popular press. A famous
headline in The Daily Express described the Report as a
&quot;junkies charter.&quot; Some people in high places and some
vested interests were getting worried. Until then, the issue of
legalizing cannabis had seemed to be a joke.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In the Parliamentary debate on the Wootton
Report on January 29th, 1969, Callaghan gave his reasons for
rejecting, or ostensibly rejecting, the Wootton Report:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;I think it came as a surprise, if not
    a shock, to most people when that notorious advertisement
    appeared in the Times in 1967 to find that there is a lobby
    for legalizing cannabis. The House should recognize that this
    lobby exists, and my reading of the Report is that the
    Wootton sub-committee was overinfluenced by this lobby. I had
    the same impression as the Rt. Hon. and learned gentleman
    (Quintin Hogg) that it was compromise at the end; that those
    who were in favour of legalizing 'pot' were all the time
    pushing the other members back, so that eventually these
    remarkable conclusions emerged, that it would be wrong to
    legalize it but that the penalties should be reduced. The
    existence of this lobby is something that the House and
    public opinion should take into account and be ready to
    combat, as I am. It is another aspect of the so-called
    permissive society, and I am glad that my decision has
    enabled the house to call a halt in the advancing tide of
    so-called permissiveness.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Articles in the Evening Standard
(February 3rd) and other newspapers said that the Chairman of the
Advisory Council, Sir Edward Wayne and Lady Wootton were both
contemplating resignation to mark their protest against the Home
Secretary's insulting remarks in Parliament. On February 5th the
Times published a joint letter from them, which said, in
part:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">We regard this statement as offensive to
    our distinguished colleagues and to ourselves, and
    particularly to the eminent medical men who signed our
    Report, and we particularly deprecate the implication of the
    emotive word 'lobby' in this context. We would also point out
    that after hearing the evidence no member of the
    sub-committee recommended legalization.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">In October I wrote in the Soma Newsletter (np.
3, pp. 4-5) that Callaghan, for all his blustering, had little
option other than to change the law:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The Government is now drafting
    comprehensive new legislation on psychotropic drugs,
    including cannabis. The legislation aims at introducing more
    flexible control of drugs and consolidating the control
    presently exercised in respect of the Dangerous Drugs Act and
    the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act. Apparently the new
    legislation will distinguish between drugs by introducing a
    two tiered system of penalties for what may, for convenience,
    be termed &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; drugs. Our
    understanding is that the problem of whether to classify
    cannabis as a hard or soft drug has not yet been faced. It is
    felt, however, that because the Home Secretary has asked the
    Wootton Committee to continue in its advisory capacity, it
    will be very difficult to justify the continued
    classification of cannabis as a hard drug in the context of
    new legislation. ...</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">It should be recalled that despite his
    posturing the Home Secretary did not refuse to implement the
    Wootton Report. He merely refused to legislate unilaterally
    and immediately on cannabis at a time when new comprehensive
    legislation was already being planned.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The story of implementing the Wootton Report is
told in a little noticed passage in the Crossman diaries.(pp.
836-7) After the legislation had been through the Home Affairs
Committee, there was an &quot;absolutely outrageous press
leak.&quot; This presumably refers to a page one lead in the
Sunday Mirror on February 1st, 1970 :&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">DRUG LAW SHOCK Jim Changes his Mind.
    Penalties for 'pot' smokers to be cut.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Home Secretary James Callaghan has has had
    a dramatic change of mind on drugs. He has decided that
    people who smoke 'pot' should no longer be punished as
    severely as those using heroin. He has gone further by
    deciding that the penalties for possessing both hard and soft
    drugs should be cut.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">... Mr. Callaghan only a year ago
    championed the cause of holding the line against drug
    permissiveness. ...Last year Mr. Callaghan denounced what he
    called &quot;a notorious advertisement&quot; in the Times -
    signed by many public figures including the Beatles - which
    urged that possessing cannabis should either be legalized, or
    at most punishable by a fine of not more than #25.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Crossman's diary entry for Thursday February
26th says that Callaghan had come back to the cabinet to say that
&quot;he now proposed not to have any reduction at all in any
penalties on cannabis.&quot; Crossman notes that this was
unusual. &quot;One usually only brings things to Cabinet when
there is disagreement at a Cabinet Committee.&quot; As the
discussion continued &quot;it became absolutely clear that the
issue was whether to kowtow to public opinion or not.&quot; The
Cabinet divided. &quot;Every member of the cabinet who had been
to university voted one way and everyone else voted the
other.&quot; Wilson voted with the antis. Having been outvoted by
a clear majority, Callaghan published his Misuse of Drugs Bill on
March 11th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The myth that Callaghan refused to implement
the proposals of the Wootton Report owes its survival to the fact
that the labour government was defeated in the general election
of 1970. However, the legislation was bipartisan and it was
reintroduced by Reginald Maudling for the tories. It became law
as the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The maximum penalty for
possession of cannabis on summary conviction was reduced by half
to six months. When the Act received the Royal Assent in 1973 the
Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham (formerly Quintin Hogg), advised
the conference of the Magistrates Association on sentencing.
(Times, 12 October 1973) He reasserted the insistence of the
Advisory Council that minor offences did not merit imprisonment.
Lord Hailsham told magistrates to treat cannabis users with
&quot;becoming moderation.&quot; He said: &quot;Set aside your
prejudice, if you have one, and reserve the sentence of
imprisonment for suitably flagrant cases of large scale
trafficking.&quot; It must have been difficult for him to set
aside his own prejudice long enough to say that, but he
did!&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ten years after the Wootton report, Ronald Butt
wrote in The Times, without intended irony, that we should be
grateful to Callaghan who put his foot down and saved us from the
permissive society by rejecting the Wootton Report. (17 March
1979) When he wrote this article Butt should have known that the
Criminal Justice Act of 1977 had reduced the maximum sentence on
summary conviction for possession to three months, less than the
four months proposed in the Wootton Report. He should also have
been aware of the 1978 Report on Sentencing of the Advisory
Council, which proposed a further reduction in penalties, ending
the status of possession of cannabis as an &quot;arrestable
offence&quot; (i.e. one for which a warrant is not required to
make an arrest) and abolishing the residual powers of the courts
to deprive offenders of their liberty. However, the Report noted
that the Courts were already observing this condition in
practice; they no longer imposed prison sentences for simple
possession offences.*&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Margaret Thatcher was heavily indebted to the
tobacco and alcohol lobbies. She sought to use the drugs issue
for political purposes. The wise counsel of civil servants and
professional advisers was by-passed when a planeload of tame MPs
departed for a Cooks Tour of American lowlife organized by the
U.S. Drugs Enforcement Agency.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Thatcher opened the doors to smugglers by
reducing the number of customs staff and she spent several
million pounds of public money on advertisements for the use of
heroin and cocaine, against the advice of the Advisory Council.
But the use of cannabis was so widespread that any attempt to
focus on its dangers would have derailed the entire campaign.
Cannabis was not singled out for attention and soon references to
cannabis became conspicuous by their absence. There was no way to
stress the dangers of narcotics without pointing up the relative
harmlessness of cannabis. On this issue Thatcher was caught in a
trap of her own making. Of course she refused to implement the
further proposals for cannabis law reform made in the 1978 Report
on Sentencing and re-affirmed in the 1982 Report on
Cannabis.&quot; However, she did make a crucial concession,
granting Chief Constables discretion to caution offenders rather
than bring them to trial. This practise has grown and now the
majority of offenders are cautioned and thus escape
conviction.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>* <font size="3">Report on A Review of the Classification of
Controlled Drugs and of Penalties Under Schedules 2 and 4 of the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (15 December 1978)&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence was
an ad hoc body. The Misuse of Drugs Act made it a statutory body
akin to the Poisons Board. It was renamed the Advisory Council on
the Misuse of Drugs.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">** Home Office Advisory Council on the Misuse
of Drugs - Report of the Expert Group on the Effects of Cannabis
Use (1982).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report was implemented twenty years
ago. Since that time we have had a &quot;half-way house&quot;,
and possession of cannabis has been virtually
&quot;decriminalized.&quot; One solicitor, Bernard Simons, who
has dealt with many drugs cases, described the present situation
in The Independent on July 22nd:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">... For me, twenty-five years ago, it was
    really important in my life - as a libertarian issue. Today
    the police rarely prosecute; they're told to administer
    cautions, and even bringing small amounts into the country
    doesn't lead to court. In my youth, in Notting Hill, people
    were stopped and searched all the time. and they had nothing
    on them. You used to have police raids on parties, where
    they'd find a bit of cannabis and arrest everyone in the
    room. Twelve people would appear in court charged with the
    same bit of cannabis. It doesn't happen any more, certainly
    not in London - though I can't speak for rural Wales. &nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The police arrest users by accident. If they
are looking for a dealer or a thief and they find some 'dope',
they make a charge. The few cases that show up in the statistics
as leading to imprisonment are artefacts; for example, a sentence
served concurrently for possession of cannabis and another more
serious drug or non drug offence. In some other cases the
quantities of cannabis seized are rather large.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A decision to legalize cannabis in the context
of EC drug policy would be bolstered by the results of such
research as has been done in the past twenty years, mainly in
America. However, the decision is likely to depend on the size
and growth of the market. The media have muddied the waters by
exaggerating the extent of cannabis smoking in the 1960s. A
leader and several articles in The Independent have insisted that
cannabis use is currently greater than at any time since the
1960s. In fact, official statistics imply a steady growth in
cannabis use over the past quarter century. The total of cannabis
seized in 1967 was 295 kilos and 457 plants. Currently seizures
are running at about 1,000 kilos per week. In twenty-five years
seizures have increased by two orders of magnitude.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cannabis is normally sold in the form of
hashish at a price of about #30 for a quarter of an ounce. That
is a week's supply for a user who smokes all day every day. I
assume that a typical user smokes cannabis two or three times a
week and consumes about a sixteenth of an ounce per week. On this
basis, the current level of seizures alone would be enough to
support a user population of half a million. But the customs use
a notional figure of five or ten per cent for the average level
of seizures.* It is therefore likely that there are several
million regular cannabis smokers in Britain, up to ten per cent
of the population. Probably the market has been saturated.
Cannabis is not everyone's cup of tea, and many people do not
enjoy its effects or are unable to experience any effect at all
from taking it. The experience of decriminalization in Holland is
that further relaxation of control does not produce any long term
increase in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* In the 'sixties the proportion of seizures
was probably lower than it is today, partially because the
penalties did not distinguish users from suppliers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The legalization of cannabis may now be on the
cards, but how will it be done? &quot;Legalization&quot; is an
extremely vague expression. My personal view has always been that
the vendor should be the State; that any other solution would
introduce a vested interest in maximizing the use of cannabis,
and, in one way or another, advertising it. In oral evidence to
the Wootton sub-committee on December 5th, 1967 I said that the
recent legalization of gambling had been a disaster because the
crooks who controlled illegal gambling remained in control of
legalized gambling. Yet there is today, in 1993, a strong opinion
in favour of legitimizing the existing trade in drugs, much of
which is in the hands of organized crime and terrorist
groups.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Mr. Lucas, a psychiatrist, asked me if I
thought the tobacco companies should sell cannabis to help them
to phase out of the production of tobacco. I said that the
tobacco companies should not be allowed to sell cannabis and that
I doubted they should even be permitted to sell tobacco.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Originally, I hoped that cannabis could be made
available through liberal prescribing of standardized
preparations. Since the 1970s I have supported those who favour a
rationing system loosely tied to the National Health System. I
think that prospective users should be required to purchase a
cannabis licence, which could be obtained from a NHS surgery. The
licence would allow them to purchase up to the equivalent of one
ounce of cannabis per month from a chemists shop. This would make
it a slight nuisance to obtain cannabis. The doctor would not be
asked to prescribe the drug, but would be entitled to know his
patient was a cannabis user. All profits from such a scheme could
go to the NHS. It would be worth a few billions per annum. In
this way the gangsters are cut out, a small overflow is provided,
the forms of cannabis available are standardized and purified,
and the profits go to a good cause. Moreover, such a scheme would
be reversible. A detailed consideration of alternative licensing
systems was provided in a book, Cannabis : Options for Change,
published by the semi-official Institute for the Study of Drug
Dependence in 1979.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Hopefully, the solution of nationalizing
cannabis may be the only one which is compatible with the control
requirements of the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, to
which Britain is a signatory. The Convention requires all states
to enact laws prohibiting the &quot;possession&quot; of cannabis
and providing for deprivation of liberty in suitable cases. This
convention was brought in as a result of long pressure from the
U. S. Treasury, which acts on behalf of the alcohol lobby in
America, and controlled or prohibited cannabis in America in the
same way that it prohibited &quot;moonshine&quot;, as tax
evasion. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics controlled by H. J.
Anslinger, a former commissioner of prohibition and a relative of
Hoover's, was part of the U.S. Treasury. It was succeeded by the
Drugs Enforcement Authority, which is part of the Department of
Justice.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report was followed by similar
reports in other countries including the </font><a
href="../ledain/NONMED.HTM"><font size="3">Le Dain Report</font></a><font
size="3"> in Canada and the </font><a href="../nc/ncmenu.htm"><font
size="3">Shafer Report</font></a><font size="3"> in America.
Following publication of the latter, by a Presidential
Commission, the government looked into the legal status of
cannabis under the Single Convention. Apparently, they obtained
an opinion based on the French text of the Convention that the
offence of possession&quot; had the meaning of the offence
described in British law as &quot;possession with intent to
sell&quot; as opposed to simple possession. The conclusion seemed
to be that cannabis could be legalized, though only with the
state acting as the seller.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It will, however, be difficult or impossible to
resist a claim from the tobacco industry. For example, one
tobacco company pays Lady Thatcher a fee in excess of #1,000,000
p.a. to act as a &quot;consultant.&quot; Such sums are paid out
to protect the public image of an industry which may have killed
off a hundred million people worldwide in the course of the
twentieth century. To the tobacco industry the Single Convention
is a paper tiger.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 8th of July 1968, the News of the World
devoted its entire pre-tabloid front page to an attack on me.
There was a marvelous picture, borrowed from the Sunday Times and
retouched, and an arrow pointing at my head. The headline said:
This dangerous man MUST be stopped! The article had no content;
it attacked my plans to manufacture small quantities of THC for
research purposes but admitted that the Home Office was aware of
the project and had no objection to it.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Four days later, on the 12th of July, the
Oxford drugs squad searched the digs of a gentleman named Stephen
Abraham, who lived with his landlady, Miss Susan Ratcliffe, in a
house at 88, Sunningwell Road. A roach, a spent cannabis
cigarette, was found in the room he occupied with Miss Ratcliffe.
The police also found an empty bottle of tincture of cannabis and
some tobacco with a green tinge. Stephen Abraham was an American
and a member of Pembroke College. He had just taken first class
honours in maths. He smoked dope like a chimney and he too had a
prescription (arranged by me) from Dr. Dunbar.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I am sorry that Graham Greene (a signatory to
the Soma advertisement) is not alive to read this, to learn about
the &quot;other Steve Abrams&quot; I kept in Oxford to get
arrested on my behalf.*&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Steve Abraham beat a strategic retreat to
America, but on August 1st, his girlfriend, Miss Ratcliffe, was
charged with the absolute offence of allowing him to smoke
cigarettes dipped in cannabis tincture in their room. The Court
and the police accepted that Abraham had a legal
prescription.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The case was heard at Oxford City Magistrates
Court on October 17th, 1968. The Bench of Magistrates, included
Mrs. H. Y. Bullock, wife of Sir Alan Bullock, the Head of my
College, then elevated to the rank of Vice Chancellor. She must
have been aware of the deliberate confusion of identities. Soma
paid half the cost of the defence, who were represented by our
solicitor, Martin Polden. Expert evidence for the defence was
provided by Dr. Ann Robinson, assistant to Professor Francis
Camps at London Hospital. (Dr. Robinson is now Professor of
Ferensic Medicine at London Hospital Medical College.)&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I have no criminal record and have never been
charged with any drugs offence. I was an Advanced Student of St.
Catherine's College from 1960 to 1967. I have never met Miss
Ratcliffe and have never been to 88, Sunningwell Road, Oxford. In
1968 I lived at 81, Holland Road, London W11 with Jane Firbank,
to whom I was then married.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The forensic scientist from Aldermaston who
gave evidence for the police said that his tests did not
distinguish between cannabis resin and extract of cannabis. He
promptly concluded that they were the same substance. He insisted
that the product of evaporating the alcohol in tincture of
cannabis (made by adding alcohol to extract of cannabis) was in
fact cannabis resin, whereas the extract was made by percolating
cannabis leaf (marijuana) in alcohol. It contained only those
components of cannabis that dissolved in alcohol.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It was argued in evidence that Abraham was
entitled to be in possession of a bottle of tincture of cannabis
but not to open it. If a fraction of the alcohol that the extract
was mixed with evaporated, that would be a step in the direction
of &quot;manufacturing cannabis resin.&quot; By the same token,
opening a bottle of cough syrup might be construed as a step in
the direction of manufacturing morphine. By pouring the contents
of a bottle of tincture of cannabis, cost 30/onto a tin of
tobacco, Abraham was supposed to have, transformed the house into
a &quot;factory&quot; for manufacturing Ireefers', according to a
report in The Times. According to The Telegraph, Abraham
manufactured enough cannabis &quot;to supply five hospitals for
seven years.&quot; That is to say, he used up a bottle of
tincture of cannabis, the same amount used by the five Oxford
hospitals over the past seven years.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This case was upheld on appeal by Brian
Gibbens, the Recorder of Oxford on January 11th, 1969, four days
after the Wootton Report was published. The decision was
criticised in legal and medical journals for making a nonsense of
the law and it was ignored outside Oxford. However, the
impression was created that following a campaign in the New of
the World, I had been convicted (in absentia) of
&quot;manufacturing&quot; cannabis resin in Oxford.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This may be a great joke, but it got on my
credit records here and in America, and it left the police with
an open warrant in my name. I was picked up several times in
London, the premises of Soma were raided, and I realized that it
was time to pack it in. Callaghan had just published his Drugs
Bill, so I could claim a victory.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There is buried somewhere in the personal
columns of The Times, probably in January or February 1969 a
small announcement advertising the fact that Steve Abrams is not
Steve Abrams &amp;c.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On July 24th 1992, twenty-five years after the
publication of the Soma advertisement, a new full paged
advertisement appeared in The Times, sponsored by the Release
Legal Emergency and Drugs Service Ltd., registered charity no.
801118.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Registered charities are not permitted to
campaign for law reform, but Release, in soliciting contributions
to defray the cost (#17,000) of the advertisement altered their
stationery to remove the designation of their charitable status
and allowed the press, e.g.? the Independent, to describe them as
a &quot;soft drugs campaigning group.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Prospective contributors and signatories to the
Release advertisement were sent a poster reproduction of the Soma
advertisement, together with advice that affirmed or strongly
implied that they had published the original as their calling
card, twenty-five years earlier. None of the signatories to the
Release advertisement got to see the embarrassing document to
which their names were appended.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I told the organizers of the Release
advertisement that they were in breach of copyright in
circulating posters of the Soma advertisement, and that they were
also guilty of the additional offence of &quot;passing off.&quot;
The Director of Release, Michael Goodman, a barrister, and one of
the &quot;founders&quot; of the organization, Mr. Rufus Harris, a
law clerk, ignored my protestations and authorised the use of a
photograph of me, ostensibly smoking a joint, on the invitation
to their 25th anniversary party.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Release did come into existence in 1967, but it
took no significant part in the cannabis law reform movement of
the late sixties. To begin with, Release was a 24 hour referral
service for a group of solicitors who specialised in defending
drugs cases. Release would have cut itself off from reputable
sources of funding had it campaigned for the legalization of
cannabis. The solicitors, who were onto a good thing, would have
been compromised.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The earliest reference to Release in The Times
is in October 1967 and all of the references are to fund raising
stunts arranged by Carolyn Coon or criticisms of the police. More
surprisingly, perhaps, there is no reference to Release in the
&quot;pot people's newspaper&quot; International Times in the
summer of 1967. A complete history of the early work of Release
is given in The Release Report by Caroline Coon and Rufus Harris
(Sphere Books, 1969). This book covers the wider interests of the
authors in the drugs problem but the text contains no reference
to the Wootton Report or to an advertisement in the Times. The
authors seem to think it wrong to, as James Callaghan said,
&quot;look at one drug in isolation.&quot; They content
themselves with a bland and ambiguous injunction, still in use,
to &quot;change the drug laws.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If this seems tame, it is. Release has a
government grant of #3,000 per week, covering sixty per cent of
its operating expenditure. In twenty-five years Release has not
done anything adventurous, nor has it published any worthwhile
research. Now independent action is out of the question. The
orchestrated pre-publicity for the 1992 advertisement, with the
media acting in concert, regurgitating handouts from the Home
Office Press office was an embarassing confirmation of the extent
of news management in the one party state that is Britain
today.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I know that things are hard, and that an
organization like Release must be encouraged to establish its
street credibility and to raise money on its own by tapping a
vein of sympathy among a drug using population of several
millions and preaching to the converted. I am not happy about
Release living on my good will, but I am amused that the Home
Office now want to get in on the act, to claim that they
themselves inspired the 1967 advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<h1>The Wootton Report</h1>

<p><b>Extract from 'The Strange Case of Pot' by Michael Schofield
(Penguin, 1971). </b></p>

<hr>

<p>Schofield was a social psychologist who sat on the Wootton
Committee and, dismayed by its reception, which led to the
introduction of the Misuse of Drugs Act, he subsequently
published this book. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In the introduction, he writes: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The original title of this book was to have been 'The
    Case For And Against Pot.' It was intended to present both
    sides of the controversy and weight the evidence before
    coming to a conclusion. But once the myths were cleared, it
    became obvious that the case for and against was not evenly
    balanced. By any ordinary standards of objectivity, it is
    clear that cannabis is not a very harmful drug. But the
    simple ranging of issues side by side is to superficial an
    approach for what is a very complex situation - really a
    social problem, much less a legal problem, and still less a
    medical problem.' </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The book is divided into three major parts. In the first
    five chapters I present the basic information about cannabis
    and compare it with the other illegal drugs. In the next six
    chapters I try to explain the public attitudes to cannabis
    and discuss the main controversies. In the last five chapters
    I attempt to describe the legal and sociological aspects, and
    end by suggesting a more sensible plan of action.' </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 7, The Wootton Report</h2>

<p>- In this chapter, Schofield discusses the background to the
establishment of the Wootton Committee and then goes on to
outline the committee's recommendations, elucidating each one. </p>

<h3>Other Reports</h3>

<p>At first Government committees were only concerned with the
opiates, and in particular with heroin addiction. The two reports
of the Interdepartmental Committee under Lord Brain in 1961 and
1965 hardly mentioned cannabis. In the first report the committee
decided that cannabis was not within their terms of reference and
concluded: 'In our view cannabis is not a drug of addiction; it
is an intoxicant.' In the second report they noted briefly that
there is 'a risk that young people may be persuaded to turn to
cannabis' which was something of an understatement even in 1965. </p>

<p>One important recommendation in the second Brain report was to
set up a Standing Advisory Committee to keep under review the
whole problem of drug dependence. As this was not a static but a
changing problem, it would be useful to bring together a group of
experts with authority to advise to advise on the social as well
as the medical aspects. This committee was set up in early 1967
under the Chairmanship of Sir Edward Wayne, MD, PhD, DSc, FRCP,
FRCP(G). Twenty-two other members were appointed, nine of whom
were doctors. A small secretariat was formed to help the
committee, but there was no money to pay for research and no
special facilities. Some of the members were doctors treating
addicts, but most of them had only a limited amount of knowledge
of drugs although all of them have learnt over the years. </p>

<p>Without the facilities to initiate or carry out research, this
committee cannot be expected to provide new facts or make
important discoveries. All that the members can do is to discuss
the matter between themselves and listen from time to time to
witnesses called to give evidence because they are experts in
some particular aspect of drug use. But nearly everyone who gives
evidence to this committee does so as the representative of an
organisation which has a special interest in drugs. Conflicting
views will be heard from the representatives of other
organisations. The function of the committee is essentially
judicial and its purpose is to reconcile the conflicting claims
of its witnesses. As there is a wide variety of opinion
represented among the members, the suggested solutions to the
various problems of drug dependence are obtained by compromising
between opposing views. The reports which are issued from time to
time usually consist of an aggregation of existing opinions.
including those of the chairman, the committee members, and the
witnesses. A research team of three or four people working full
time is more likely to produce more penetrating and workable
solutions to the problems of drug use than a committee of
prominent citizens meeting three or four times a year to compile
and select from conflicting expert opinions. </p>

<p>None the less the committee has been able to give useful
advice to the Home Office and Ministry of Social Security on the
best way to implement the earlier recommendations of the Brain
committee. Treatment centres for heroin addicts have been set up
and special arrangements were introduced to control the outbreak
of methedrine injections. Perhaps the most important work has
been done in the sub-committees which have met more regularly
than the main committee. There have been sub-committees on
rehabilitation (published as a report by HMSO in 1969) and health
education (the results were circularised by the Department of
Education), amphetamines, LSD, and the powers of search and
arrest (these reports were published by HMSO in 1970). In April
1967 a special sub-committee was appointed to review the
available evidence on the pharmacological, clinical,
pathological, social and legal aspects of cannabis. After
seventeen meetings under the chairmanship of Baroness Wootton,
the sub-committee's report was published in January 1969. </p>

<hr>

<h2>The Recommendations</h2>

<p><b>(1) We recommend that in the interest of public health, it
is necessary for the time being to maintain restrictions on the
availability of cannabis.</b> </p>

<p>- Although it is stated in the report that the consumption of
cannabis in moderate doses has no harmful effects, the committee
felt less sure about the mental effects. This recommendation,
therefore, is intended to be a temporary measure and should be
reviewed from time to time, when more is known about the effects
as a result of medical and social research. Meanwhile the courts
should recognise that there is considerable variation in the
personalities and motives of people who use cannabis. </p>

<p><b>(2) Every encouragement, both academic and financial,
should be given to suitable projects for enquiry into the
cannabis problem.</b> </p>

<p>- It follows that if there is a lack of information on an
important and controversial problem, every effort should be made
to provide research facilities. Although three working parties
have been set up by the medical Research Council and an Institute
for the Study of Drug Dependence has been established, progress
is very slow. It is inevitable that research into drug use will
be a lengthy business, but it is disquieting that even three
years after the formation of the Government's Advisory Committee,
very few large-scale research projects have even been started. </p>

<p>In March 1970, the Home Office issued a list of research on
drug dependence. This list contained ten biochemical and
pharmacological studies, mainly concerned with the developments
of techniques for detecting cannabis in the body. there were no
cannabis studies listed under the clinical and treatment section.
Five studies were listed under the social and psychological
section; three of these (Chapple, 1966; Paton, 1968; Tylden,
1968) who had written papers strongly opposed to the use of
cannabis even before starting the research; only one of the five
has been undertaken by a sociologist. so far the Social Science
Research Council has not supported any researches on the use of
cannabis even though it is in the area of sociology that we most
need information. </p>

<p>The Wootton committee found that it was impossible to estimate
the number of people who used cannabis and the guesses seem to
range between 30,000 and 300,000. It is clearly impossible to
make sense of statements about the social consequences of
widespread use of cannabis until there are some reliable
estimates of the prevalence of regular users. No detailed
information is available about the extent of cannabis use by
immigrants. There is an immediate need for sociological and
psychological studies to define the different social groups and
to describe the personalities of people who smoke cannabis.
People do not hesitate to criticise the young for taking drugs,
but in fact no one knows how many adolescents do take cannabis,
how many use the drug only occasionally at parties and week-ends,
and how many take it regularly. Only a well-planned research
would show if there are differentiating characteristics between
users who take only cannabis and people who used to take cannabis
but have now given up all drug use. </p>

<p><b>(3) The law should progressively be recast to give
Parliament greater flexibility of control over individual drugs.</b>
</p>

<p>- This was one of the few recommendations which the Home
Secretary found acceptable, although it seems likely that he does
not interpret the 'greater flexibility of control' in the same
sense as the Wootton Committee. Mr Callaghan, speaking during the
debate on the Wootton report, said that he would put before the
House proposals which would give him more power to handle the
problem in a much more flexible manner. He then went on to
criticise the restrictions of the 1964 Drugs Act which in fact
does not apply to cannabis. He wanted the power to bring new
synthetic drugs under the Act as they were developed and became
popular with users, and he also mentioned the need to have
stronger legal control over manufacturers, doctors, chemists, and
others who distribute the drugs. he felt that there was 'a clear
risk that each new fashion of drug taking will find new gaps in
the defences, which will only be plugged too late' and the
solution would be 'to have a single comprehensive code which
would rationalise and strengthen the Government's powers.'
(Quoted from Hansard, 27 January, 1969, column 967). There is
much substance in Mr Callaghan's remarks about changing fashions
in the drugs scene but this has nothing to do with the Wootton
report which is about cannabis, a drug that is already
fashionable and is hardly ever prescribed by medical men. It is
difficult to see what the Home Secretary's call for new
legislation has to do with cannabis unless he feels that one drug
is much like another, an attitude of mind that Lady Wootton and
her colleagues were most anxious to alter. </p>

<p>The Wootton committee suggested changes in the law because
there is now a better understanding of the reasons why people use
drugs. Criminological studies have cast doubts on the
effectiveness of deterrents and the general law on the treatment
of offenders has been changed considerable. The committee felt
that 'the penalties for cannabis offences have gone unreviewed
for too long'. Their idea of flexibility was that the law should
be adjusted according to the dangers of the drug and the way it
is misused. </p>

<p><b>(4) The association in legislation of cannabis and heroin
and the other opiates is inappropriate and new legislation to
deal specifically and separately with cannabis and its synthetic
derivatives should be introduced as soon as possible.</b> </p>

<p>- There are two reasons for this. Many people agree that the
confusion between cannabis and heroin leads to misunderstandings
and, in some cases, to injustice. The committee also stated quite
clearly that the present penalties for possession of cannabis
were altogether too high. The Government accepted the third
recommendation for reasons other than those given by the
committee, and after some hesitation, the fourth recommendation
was also incorporated into the new (Misuse of Drugs) Bill,
although the penalties for possession of cannabis are still
severe. </p>

<p><b>(5) Unlawful possession of cannabis without knowledge
should not be an offence. The practicability of distinguishing
between possession intended for use and possession intended for
supply should be examined.</b> </p>

<p>- This brings to notice two of the several difficulties
encountered in a law which is about possession when what we are
really concerned about is the misuse of drugs. Although a recent
test case was taken as far as the House of Lords the resulting
decision was by no means clear because the issues in that
particular case were complex. The law should make it quite
certain that a person cannot be incriminated, for example, by
someone putting cannabis in his coat pocket without his
knowledge. The police maintain that is extremely difficult to
catch someone in the act of dealing in cannabis or any other
drug. The unsatisfactory solution to this problem under the 1965
Act was to retain high maximum penalties for the offence of
possession so that the courts could sentence a man who had been
found guilty of one offence (i.e. possession) as if he has been
found guilty of another (i.e. supply). It is a form of justice
that is open to question, it is a bit like the bench saying to a
motorist: 'You have been caught exceeding the speed limit and we
have been told that you had been drinking rather heavily;
however, we can't prove that you were drunk, so we are going to
give you a very heavy sentence for speeding.' The proposals for
the new legislation allow this practise to continue: although the
new offence of 'possession with intent to supply' is introduced,
a maximum penalty of five years for the possession of cannabis is
proposed. It is difficult to imagine a situation where the simple
possession of cannabis deserves such a severe sentence. The new
Bill distinguishes between possession and trafficking and
increases the penalty for selling cannabis to a maximum of
fourteen years. This reflects the public demand for heavy
penalties for traffickers which is based on a misunderstanding of
the role of the dealer. Nevertheless if a man is making money out
of selling an illegal substance, it is reasonable to expect him
to be dealt with more severely than someone who is merely using
the drug. </p>

<p><b>(6) Possession of a small amount of cannabis should not
normally be regarded as a serious crime to be punished by
imprisonment.</b> </p>

<p>- This is a very radical recommendation and one which caused a
large amount of adverse comment in the press. But informed
opinion is coming round to the idea that prison is not a sensible
way to treat people who wish to use cannabis. What even informed
opinion found it difficult to take was the explicit statement
that possession in not a serious crime. But the committee went
still further in paragraph 90 of the report, where they state
that prison is the wrong place even for those who supply on a
limited scale. they do not attempt to define what they mean by a
limited scale, but even a fairly strict definition would include
about nine out of ten of the transactions between users and
sellers because the amounts involved are so small. </p>

<p><b>(7) The offence of unlawful possession, sale or supply of
cannabis should be punishable on summary conviction with a fine
not exceeding 100, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding
four months, or both such fine and imprisonment. On conviction or
indictment the penalty should be an unlimited fine, or
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both such fine
and imprisonment.</b> </p>

<p>- Thus the committee recommended considerable reductions in
the penalties. The penalties for possession under the 1965 Act in
force when the committee reported, the penalties in the new Bill
and the penalties recommended in the Wootton report are
summarised as follows: </p>

<pre>
<font size="2">Maximum         1965 Act                1970 Bill               Wootton penalties                                                               Report
Summary conviction:
Fine                    250            400            100 Imprisonment    12 months               6 months                4 months
Indictment:
Fine                    1,000          unlimited               unlimited Imprisonment    10 years                5 years         2 years</font>
</pre>

<p>Some members of the committee argued strongly against any kind
of prison sentence for simple possession, but in the end were
persuaded to agree to a maximum penalty of four months
imprisonment because this sentence would allow the defendant the
option of going for trial by jury and also because a prison
sentence gives the judiciary the chance to deal with what the
committee called 'difficult individual cases'. The committee were
aware that a substantial part of the smuggling of cannabis is in
small amounts (paragraph 37) and is not exploited to any
significant extent by professional criminals (paragraph 38).
Therefore they expected that most cases would be dealt with
summarily by imposing a small fine. the reaction to this showed
that it was a most unpopular recommendation. The home secretary
and the opposition spokesman on Home Affairs both said that this
recommendation would make it appear that Parliament was condoning
the smoking of cannabis. ('If we were to adopt what is proposed
or started to take a namby-pampy attitude about it, we should
need our heads examined. I range myself wholeheartedly behind the
Home Secretary on this issue.' Quentin Hogg in Hansard, 27
January 1969, column 957) </p>

<p><b>(8) The existing law which inhibits research requiring the
smoking of cannabis (section 5, Dangerous Drugs Act, 1965) should
be amended to allow qualified workers to study its use both by
observation and by laboratory and social experiments.</b> </p>

<p>- There has been considerable uncertainty about the smoking of
cannabis for research purposes with the result that no serious
study has been made in this country on the effects of smoking on
humans, even in laboratory conditions. As the social factors are
even more important than the pharmacological problems, it is
essential that researchers should be free to study these
phenomena by observations and experiments outside as well as
inside the laboratory without the risk of prosecution. Although
the Home Secretary gave the lack of information as the reason for
rejecting many of the recommendations in the Wootton Report, it
was notable that he never mentioned this in the House of Commons.
In fact this was one of the earliest and most urgent of the
suggestions made by the full Standing Advisory committee, long
before the Wootton report was published. Many members realised
that their work was hindered by the shortage of information that
could only be obtained by fairly elaborate and lengthy research.
It was suggested that a short Bill should be put before
Parliament to make research on cannabis possible without the risk
of prosecution. It was thought that such a bill would not arouse
much opposition, but the Home Office advisors to the committee
felt that this plan was not practical. They maintained that for a
short Bill on the subject of research into cannabis could not be
confined to this subject and far-reaching amendments would be
added during its passage through Parliament. so it was decided to
wait until the Government was ready to introduce comprehensive
legislation into which a special clause would be included to
allow bona fide research workers to investigate the effects of
smoking cannabis. But in fact three years have been lost between
the time when the law on cannabis research might have been
changed and the introduction of this new legislation. It is
possible that much useful information could have been obtained in
that time, information which would have been invaluable during
the preparation of the new Bill and the subsequent discussion of
various proposals. </p>

<p><b>(9) Section 5 of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1965 (permitting
premises to be used for smoking cannabis, etc.) should be
redefined in scope so as to apply to premises open to the public,
to exclude the reference to dealing in cannabis and cannabis
resin, and to remove the absolute nature of the liability on
managers.</b> </p>

<p>- This recommendation has been partly approved by the Home
Secretary in the proposals for new legislation so that occupiers
and managers commit an offence if they knowingly permit a drug to
be used or sold in their premises. This will obviate the
liability of the landlord of private premises who would have been
convicted under the old law even if he was able to show that he
did not know that pot was being smoked in his house. But the Home
Secretary has rejected the suggestion that this should only be an
offence in public premises. </p>

<p><b>(10) The Advisory Committee should undertake, as a matter
of urgency, a review of police powers of arrest and search in
relation to drug offences generally, with a view to advising the
Secretary of State on any changes that may be appropriate in the
law, particularly as regards cannabis.</b> </p>

<p>- The Wootton committee seemed to think this task was too big
for them because they felt that the question of police powers
could not be realistically considered in relation to cannabis
alone. But there is no doubt that this is a most important issue.
There is a growing public concern about the way the police are
using their powers of search and arrest and many youth workers
see this as one of the main causes of the substantial
deterioration in the relations between young people and the
police. It may be said that this recommendation is a bit timid.
In a large numbers of cases, the police search for drugs in
general, but this is not true of every case. There must be
occasions when the reasonable grounds for suspicion relate only
to the use of cannabis; for example, it is the only drug that has
a pungent smell. the very extensive police powers of search and
arrest, which may be necessary for the more harmful drugs, are
difficult to justify for cannabis, the possession of which,
according to the report, is a relatively minor offence. This
recommendation was thought to be 'a matter of urgency' and a new
sub-committee under the chairmanship of William Deedes was set up
soon after the Wootton report was published. In an early debate
on drugs Mr Deedes said in the House of Commons: 'It makes no
sense for the police to go round raiding and stripping young
people at parties to find drugs, some of which their elders treat
as a staple diet. the posture against the young becomes morally
untenable.' But his report turned out to be rather a
disappointing document, with few positive recommendations. </p>

<p><b>(11) The development of the manufacture of synthetic
cannabinols should be kept under review and, if necessary,
control should be imposed under powers provided by the Pharmacy
and Poisons Act, 1933, and The Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act,
1964.</b> </p>

<p>- Much progress is being made in the pharmacological study of
cannabis and the active ingredient has been synthesised. It is
possible that synthetic pot will be available in large quantities
before long, and this substance is likely to be purer and safer,
and perhaps more potent, than the product obtained from the
plant. Such a substance would not be covered by the Dangerous
Drugs Act of 1965, but the proposed legislation would make it
possible to add new products of the pharmacological industry to
the schedule of restricted drugs simply by regulations placed
before the two Houses of Parliament. </p>

<p><b>(12) Preparations of cannabis and its derivatives should
continue to be available on prescription for purposes of medical
treatment and research. Provision should be made in legislation
for records to be maintained so that the position can be kept
under review.</b> </p>

<p>- The committee did not want to hinder the few doctors who are
experimenting with the use of cannabis in the treatment of
disturbed adolescents, amphetamine dependence, alcoholism and
other conditions which are difficult medical problems. Although
there have been few indications of success in this treatment, it
is hoped that the new legislation will not interfere with these
experiments. In summary, the Wootton report found that most of
the fears about cannabis were groundless. Physically it is much
less dangerous than the other illegal drugs; most people can give
it up readily and without withdrawal symptoms. Most cannabis
users are industrious and law-abiding; there is no evidence that
in Britain it provokes the user to crime other than the crime of
possessing it. nor is there any evidence to support the widely
held belief that cannabis is a significant step in the escalation
to heroin. It was agreed that cannabis is a potent drug, like
alcohol, and that is was necessary to maintain restrictions on
its availability for the time being; these restrictions would
have to be more severe than they are for alcohol until more was
known about the long-term effects of the drug. Nevertheless it
was quite inappropriate to make cannabis subject to the same
penalties as heroin under the Dangerous Drugs Act and it was
wrong to send people to prison for the possession of a small
amount. Research has been hampered and the law should be changed
so as to encourage careful long-term investigations into the
effects of smoking cannabis. When these results are available,
the interim recommendations should be reviewed. These main
conclusions were not so very different from the results found in
earlier reports including the very thorough investigations made
in India and the city of New York, and the more recent studies
made in Canada and by the President's Commission in Washington.
But the publication of the Wootton report was greeted with a
chorus of abuse from politicians, press and the public.<br>

<h2>CHAPTER ONE </h2>

<h2>THE COMMISSION'S INTERPRETATION OF ITS TASK </h2>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Background of the Commission's Appointment </h3>

<p>1. The Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs
was appointed by the Government of Canada under Part I of the
Inquiries Act on May 29, 1969, on the recommendation of the
Honourable John Munro, Minister of National Health and Welfare. </p>

<p>The concern that gave rise to the appointment of the
Commission is described in Order-in-Council P.C. 1969-1112, which
authorized the appointment, in the following terms: </p>

<p>The Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a
report from the Minister of National Health and Welfare,
representing: </p>

<p>'That there is growing concern in Canada about the non-medical
use of certain drugs and substances, particularly, those having
sedative, stimulant, tranquillizing or hallucinogenic properties,
and the effect of such use on the individual and the social
implications thereof; </p>

<p>That within recent years, there has developed also the
practice of inhaling the fumes of certain solvents having an
hallucinogenic effect, and resulting in serious physical damage
and a number of deaths, such solvents being found in certain
household substances. Despite warnings and considerable
publicity, this practice has developed among young people and can
be said to be related to the use of drugs for other than medical
purposes; </p>

<p>That certain of these drugs and substances including lysergic
acid diethylamide, LSD, methamphetamines, commonly referred to as
'Speed', and certain others, have been made the subject of
controlling or prohibiting legislation under the Food and Drugs
Act, and cannabis, marijuana, has been a substance, the
possession of or trafficking in which has been prohibited under
the Narcotic Control Act; </p>

<p>That notwithstanding these measures and the competent
enforcement thereof by the R.C.M. Police and other enforcement
bodies, the incidence of possession and use of these substances
for non-medical purposes has increased and the need for an
investigation as to the cause of such increasing use has become
imperative. </p>

<p>During the year or so preceding the appointment of the
Commission, members of parliament had called for an inquiry into
the use of drugs. One member spoke of 'the galloping increase in
the use of marijuana and the increasing number of young people
tragically being paraded daily before the courts' and of 'the
extreme urgency of dealing properly with these cases'. In
announcing the Government's intention to appoint the Commission,
the Minister of National Health and Welfare spoke of 'the grave
concern felt by the Government at the expanding proportions of
the use of drugs and related substances for non-medical
purposes'. </p>

<h3>The Commission's Terms of Reference </h3>

<p>3. The Order-in-Council authorizing the appointment of the
Commission sets out its terms of reference as follows; </p>

<p>That inquiry be made into and concerning the factors
underlying or relating to the non-medical use of the drugs and
substances above described and that for this purpose a Commission
of Inquiry be established, constituted and with authority as
hereinafter provided. </p>

<p>(a) to marshal from available sources, both in Canada and
abroad, data and information comprising the present fund of
knowledge concerning the non-medical use of sedative, stimulant,
tranquillizing, hallucinogenic and other psychotropic drugs or
substances; </p>

<p><i>(b) </i>to report on the current state of medical knowledge
respecting the effect of the drugs and substances referred to in
(a); </p>

<p><i>(c)</i> to inquire into and report on the motivation
underlying the non-medical use referred to in (a); </p>

<p><i>(d)</i> <i>to inquire into and report on the social,
economic, edu</i>cational and philosophical factors relating to
the use for non-medical purposes of the drugs and substances
referred to in (a) and in particular, on the extent of the
phenomenon, the social factors that had led to it, the age groups
involved, and problems of communication; and </p>

<p><i>(e)</i> <i>to inquire into and recommend with respect to
the ways </i>or means by which the Federal Government can act,
alone or in its relations with Government at other levels, in the
reduction of the dimensions of the problems involved in such use.
</p>

<h3>The Implications of the Terms of Reference </h3>

<p>4. While the Commission's terms of reference make specific
mention of the sedative, stimulant, tranquillizing and
hallucinogenic drugs, they also require inquiry concerning other
psychotropic drugs and substances. <i>The Commission understands
drug to mean any substance that by its chemical nature</i><b> </b><i>alters
structure or function in the living organism. The psychotropic
drugs are those drugs which alter sensation, mood, consciousness
or other psychological or behavioural functions. </i>These
concepts are further clarified in Chapter Two<b> </b>of this
report. A number of classifications of psychotropic drugs have
been brought to the Commission's attention. Chapter Two presents
the classification that has been accepted by the Commission. It
also contains a detailed account of the psychotropic properties
and medical and non-medical uses of certain of the drugs causing
the greatest public concern. It is clear to the Commission that
it would not be appropriate to confine its attention to the
so-called 'soft drugs' such as marijuana, hashish and LSD. The
'hard drugs' such as the opiate narcotics, of which heroin is an
example, have marked psychotropic effects. The amphetamines or
'speed' drugs which are popularly considered as hard drugs appear
to be increasing in their non-medical use. Moreover, both the
structure of present Canadian drug laws and the nature of the
drug controversy make it impossible to consider the 'soft drugs'
without reference to the amphetamines and the opiates. Indeed,
the opiate narcotics have been and are an important reference
point in, establishing the public perspective for the non-medical
use of many other drugs. The Commission believes that it has
properly focused its primary attention in the initial phase of
its inquiry on the non-medical use of drugs such as cannabis, LSD
and amphetamines by young people. However, we have had a growing
concern for the facts and implications of the use of drugs such
as alcohol and tobacco by people of all ages. These two drugs,
both of which are psychotropic, remain the most popular drugs in
non-medical use among both young people and adults. Adults
generally seem unwilling to accept the fact that alcohol and
tobacco are drugs, and often find it difficult to view the
non-medical drug use of youth with reference to and in the
context of the socially acceptable use of drugs by adults. </p>

<p>5. Two broad categories in which the use of psychotropic drugs
can be classified are: (a) medical and non-medical use, and (b)
legal and illegal use. While the distinction between legal and
illegal use is simple and derives directly from the law, it is
difficult to find a satisfactory definition of medical and
non-medical drug use. <i>Medical use of drugs is taken</i> <i>by
the Commission to be use which is indicated for generally
accepted medical reasons, whether under medical supervision or
not; all drug use which is not indicated on generally accepted
medical grounds is considered to be non-medical use. </i>Thus,
the occasional use of aspirin to control the pain of an ordinary
headache is considered to be medical use, while the dependent use
of large quantities of barbiturates obtained through one or more
prescriptions is not. Clearly, non-medical use is not to be
equated with illegal use. The use of alcohol by adults is
generally non-medical but it is legal, whereas the use of
marijuana is both non-medical and illegal. </p>

<p>6. The commission is invited to marshal the present fund of
world knowledge concerning the non-medical use of psychotropic
drugs and substances. Taken literally, this task is impossible,
with the time and resources available to the Commission. The
world literature on all the psychotropic drugs and substances is
very extensive. There are over 40,000 items on alcohol alone at
Rutgers University, a major centre of alcohol studies. There are
estimated to be over 2,000 items on cannabis. Experts in the
field have testified to the extreme difficulty of keeping abreast
of the literature, particularly because of its multi-disciplinary
character. There are only a few sources of comprehensive
information on this continent: the Addiction Research Foundation
of Ontario is by far the best equipped in this country; the
National Institute of Mental Health in the United States provides
a computerized data retrieval service. In Geneva, the World
Health Organization of the United Nations possesses extensive
bibliographical resources. </p>

<p>Collecting the available data and information is only one
stage. It is also necessary to establish and apply criteria of
scientific validity to such data and information. In many
instances, the Commission is obliged to rely heavily on the work
of experts who have themselves sifted and critically evaluated
the available literature. It must form its judgements on the
basis of the materials which they have identified as most
relevant and reliable. The Commission cannot carry out a
comprehensive bibliographical work for the whole range of
psychotropic drugs and substances. It must try to seize upon the
essentials in the present fund of knowledge as they bear upon the
areas of concern and the issues in this inquiry. </p>

<p>7. The Commission is required to report on the current state
of medical knowledge concerning the effect of psychotropic drugs
and substances. This it has attempted to do in an interim
fashion, in Chapter Two, entitled 'The Drugs and Their Effects'.
The effects contemplated by paragraph (b) in the terms of
reference are presumably the physiological and psychological
ones, including their behavioural manifestations. The term
'medical' is rather too narrow as a reference to the expertise
which is in the determination of drug effects since these are a
complex result of many factors, including the expectation of the
user and the social setting in which the drug is taken. In its
interim brief to the Commission, the Canadian Medical Association
stressed the multi-disciplinary character of the study required
for a proper understanding of non-medical drug use. We have,
therefore, interpreted the word 'medical' to refer broadly to all
scientific knowledge concerning the effects of drug use. The
language of paragraph (b) of the terms of reference suggests that
it was not intended that the Commission would itself undertake
original research into the effects of non-medical drug use.
Although we do not exclude the possibility of some clinical or
experimental work, particularly with respect to the effect of
certain drugs on psychomotor functions, it is our opinion that
with the time and resources at our disposal, and having regard to
the research currently being conducted by such organizations as
the Addiction Research Foundation and the National Institute of
Mental Health, we should confine ourselves to carrying out a
critical review of the existing knowledge and ongoing research,
as well as attempting to identify research priorities and the
role which the federal government can play in relation to
research. </p>

<p>8. The remaining paragraphs in the terms of reference deal
with the extent and the causes of non-medical drug use. They
reflect a broad concern to understand the reasons for the
increase in such use. They invite the Commission to attempt to
place this phenomenon in a proper social and philosophic context.
We cannot help feeling that this is one of the most important
aspects of our task: one on which there is a compelling need for
an understanding of current Canadian attitudes. This is implied
by the allusion in paragraph (d) of the terms of reference to
'problems of communication'. To understand the factors underlying
non-medical drug use and the problems for which government action
may be indicated, it is necessary to consider not only the
effects, extent, and causes of such use, but the range of social
response and attitude which such use has elicited from
government, other institutions and individuals. For non-medical
drug use and the social response to it are interacting and
mutually conditioning phenomena. </p>

<h3>Methods of Inquiry </h3>

<p>9. The Commission has used a variety of methods of inquiry.
Because of the profound social significance of the non-medical
drug use phenomenon and of the importance of personal and public
attitudes to it, the Commission decided early to conduct public
hearings in all of the provinces. It has attached particular
important to these hearings. They have been used to foster the
widest possible public discussion. In order to encourage the
participation of young people, it was decided to hold some of the
public hearings in more informal settings than may have been
customary for such commissions in the past. In addition to the
public hearings, the Commissioners have collectively and
individually held numerous private hearings, have consulted with
experts in several fields related to non-medical drug use, and
have read extensively in the scientific and legal literature. The
Commission has also received many communications, written and
oral, from Canadians in all walks of life. </p>

<p>10. At the beginning of September, 1969, the Commission wrote
to over 750 individuals and organizations inviting them to submit
briefs or to make oral submissions. In particular, the Commission
solicited briefs from: federal and provincial government
departments; law enforcement authorities, educational
institutions and associations; members of university faculties
and departments; medical and pharmaceutical institutions and
associations, addiction research foundations; street clinics and
other innovative services; correctional and welfare
organizations; bar associations; youth organizations; student
organizations; and a wide variety of other organizations and
individuals having an evident concern or point of contact with
the phenomenon of non-medical drug use in Canada. The Commission
received a gratifying response to this invitation, and despite
the relatively short time available in some cases for the
preparation of briefs, individuals and organizations made a very
commendable effort to prepare submissions for the public hearings
which began in the middle of October. </p>

<p>11. A list of the organizations and individuals who have been
identified with submissions to the Commission in the initial
phase of this inquiry is contained in Appendix A to this report,
Fifty-five organizations have been represented at the public
hearings at which they have submitted written briefs; twenty have
been represented by oral submissions; forty-five have made
written submissions to the Commission without appearing at a
public hearing. Thirty two individuals have submitted written
briefs and 45 others have made oral submissions at public
hearings. In addition, there have been numerous oral submissions
and interventions by members of the public who have attended the
hearings. The Commission has also received several hundred
letters from individuals, and a selection of these letters or
excerpts from them is included in the Report as Appendix B. We
emphasize that this selection is not intended to convey the
weight of opinion in this correspondence, but simply to reflect
something of the range of response. </p>

<p>12. In the initial phase of this inquiry, the Commission has
held public hearings in the following centres: Toronto - October
16, 17 and 18; Vancouver - October 30 and 31; Victoria - November
1; Montreal - November 6, 7 and 8; Winnipeg - November 13 and 14;
Ottawa - December 12 and 13; Halifax - January 29 and 30; St.
John's - January 31; Fredericton - February 19; Moncton -
February 20; Sackville - February 20; and Charlottetown -
February 21; Kingston - March 5. </p>

<p>A special word may be appropriate concerning the nature of the
public hearings. They have been conducted in a rather informal
manner. There has been a considerable degree of audience
participation. People have felt free to comment on formal
submissions, and there has been a great deal of informal exchange
among persons attending the hearings. On the whole, response to
this style of hearing has been favourable, although there has
been some criticism from one or two organizations who have
expressed the opinion that we should not have permitted questions
and critical comments from members of the public. Because of the
nature of the phenomenon which it is required to investigate, the
Commission is convinced that it has been essential to attempt to
establish a true public forum for discussion<i> </i>of the
issues. Most organizations have reacted favourably to this kind
of inquiry. In addition to the more traditional settings of
hotels and public buildings, the Commission has held public
hearings at universities and from time to time in coffee houses
that have become centres of the new youth culture. </p>

<p>Informal hearings have been held in the following
universities: York University; the University of Toronto; the
University of British Columbia; the University of Montreal;
McGill University; Sir George Williams University; the University
of Manitoba; the University of Winnipeg; the University of
Ottawa; Carleton University; Dalhousie University; Memorial
University; the University of New Brunswick; the University of
Moncton; Mount Allison University; the University of Prince
Edward Island; and in the following coffee houses: 'The Penny
Farthing' in Yorkville, Toronto; 'The Bistro' in Vancouver, and
the 'Back Door' in Montreal. </p>

<p>The hearings in these more informal settings have given the
Commission direct and vivid contact with the opinions and
attitudes of young people in Canada. All the Commission hearings
have been recorded on tape, and in addition there has been a
stenographic record. In many ways it is a matter of regret that
an audio-visual record could not have been made, but the nature
of the subject matter is such that the Commission felt obliged to
protect individuals appearing before it from undue publicity. The
media have cooperated with the Commission in respecting its
request that members of the public should not be photographed
while making submissions. In many cases, the submissions have
been of a highly personal nature, and the hearings would have
been much inhibited if they had been photographed. At the same
time, the Commission has been intensely aware of the fact that it
was listening to an unusual social commentary. Opinions and
feelings have poured forth in the hearings with great
spontaneity, particularly in the more informal settings. The
Commission has been deeply impressed, and on several occasions,
moved by the testimony which it has heard. It has been struck by
the depth of feeling which this phenomenon and the social
response to it have aroused. As a result of the initial phase of
its inquiry, the Commission is more than ever convinced that the
proper response to the non-medical use of psychotropic drugs is a
question which must be worked out by the people of Canada,
examining it and talking it over together. It goes to the roots
of our society and touches the values underlying our whole
approach to life. It is not a matter which can be confined to the
discrete consultation of experts, although experts obviously have
their role, and a very important one, to play. </p>

<p>13. A word should be said about the protection of witnesses.
The terms of reference of the Commission empower it to take
testimony in such manner as to safeguard the anonymity of
witnesses. The Order-in-Council authorizing the appointment of
the Commission provides: </p>

<p>That the said Commissioners may, if they deem the same
expedient, cause a record to be made of the evidence which shall
be given or produced before them, or any part of that evidence,
as to the matters to be inquired into and reported upon and may
direct that the oral evidence of witnesses, before them, or any
such witness, shall be taken in shorthand by a shorthand writer,
approved and sworn by the said Commissioners or one of them, and
may direct that the oral evidence of any such witness may be so
given and recorded, whether under oath or otherwise, without a
disclosure of the identity of that witness, and that any evidence
so recorded shall be certified by the person or persons taking
the same in shorthand, as correct. </p>

<p>The notices which the Commission has published of its hearings
have given prominence to this readiness to take evidence given
privately and anonymously, and many witnesses have availed
themselves of this opportunity. The Commission has also received
a number of anonymous submissions through the mail. At the same
time, concern has been expressed from time to time that the
public hearings might be used for law enforcement purposes. As a
result of an understanding at the outset of this inquiry with the
officers of the R.C.M.P., the Commission has been able to assure
the public that its hearings would not be exploited for law
enforcement purposes. It has every reason to believe that this
understanding has been respected. Although there have been
rumours from time to time that law enforcement personnel have
taken advantage of the hearings for purposes of investigation, no
evidence of this has been brought to the attention of the
Commission, despite public statements by the Chairman that any
such instances should be reported to him. </p>

<p>The Commission has been very impressed by the candour with
which people of all ages have come forward and spoken from a
depth of conviction, and feeling about the phenomenon of
non-medical drug usage and its relation to other aspects of
social and cultural change today. </p>

<p>14. Altogether, it is estimated that nearly 12,000 Canadians
have attended the hearings up to the end of February. The
Commissioners have travelled some 17,000 miles, and in the months
ahead they will continue to move back and forth across the
country until every province and major city have been visited, as
well as many of the smaller communities. </p>

<p>15. The Commission has had the benefit of a wide range of
advice from experts in the field of non-medical drug use. It is
only possible here to mention some of those who were particularly
helpful. </p>

<p>The Commission has had several sessions with officers of the
R.C.M.P, and has received the fullest cooperation from the Force
in its attempt to understand the lessons of law enforcement in
this field. In addition to the public submission of the Force,
each Division prepared a brief, and the Commission has had the
advantage of private hearings with officers from each Division.
Moreover, research consultants of the Commission have been
permitted to observe law enforcement by the Force at first hand.
The Commission has also received a number of written
communications from the Force in addition to its formal
submissions. We can not speak too highly of the cooperation that
we have received from the R.C.M.P., who went to particular
trouble, on relatively short notice in the initial stages of the
inquiry, to give the Commission the benefit of their experience.
Whatever view one may take of law enforcement policy in this
controversial field, we feel obliged to record our respect for
the highly professional manner in which the R.C.M.P. have sought
to per-form their duty in relation to this inquiry. We look
forward to their continued cooperation as we deepen our study of
the problems of law enforcement and the administration of justice
in the field of non-medical drug use. </p>

<p>The Commission has also received a great deal of valuable
assistance from addiction foundations, notably the Addiction
Research Foundation of Ontario, the Narcotic Addiction Foundation
of British Columbia, and OPTAT (Office de la Prevention et du
Traitement de l'Alcoolisme et des Autres Toxicomanies). From the
outset of its inquiry the Commission has had the benefit of
frequent consultation with members of the Ontario Foundation, and
the Commission's research staff have made extensive use of the
bibliographical and documentary resources of the Foundation. </p>

<p>The Commission has also consulted with many other experts, in
Canada and the United States. It plans to consult with many more,
including experts outside North America, in the ensuing year. For
the present, it would like to make special mention of the
assistance which it has received from Dr J. Robertson Unwin, Dr
Lionel Solursh and Mr Wilfred Clement, whose intimate knowledge
of the Canadian drug scene from a scientific, yet deeply human
perspective, has made their observations and advice invaluable.
The Commission should also record its indebtedness for advice
received in the early stages of the inquiry from Dr Helen Nowlis
of the University of Rochester, Samuel Pearlman of the City
University of New York, Dr Daniel Glaser of the New York State
Narcotic Addiction Control Commission; members of the National
Institute of Mental Health, and Department of Justice in the
United States. </p>

<h3>The Role of the Interim Report </h3>

<p>16. We have had some difficulty in determining what should be
the role of our interim report. In particular, we have been
somewhat perplexed as to how far we are justified in coming to
conclusions and making recommendations at this time. But we are
required by our terms of reference to render an interim report,
and we assume that something more is expected than a simple
report of progress. We believe that what is expected, at the very
least, is a report, which conveys our initial understanding of
the subject matter of the inquiry and makes such recommendations
as we feel are urgent and for which we believe we have a
sufficient basis at this time. We hope it will serve to put the
phenomenon of non-medical drug use in some perspective, to
identify the issues, and to provide the basis for further
consideration and discussion by the people of Canada. Further, by
identifying certain attitudes, hypotheses, and tentative
opinions, the interim report will serve, we hope, as a sounding
board, eliciting further evidence and opinion, and indicating to
us wherein our definition of the issues and our preliminary
opinions may require revision. </p>

<p>17. The function of the final report will be to complete the
picture begun by the interim report and to report upon the system
of social response which we recommend for the phenomenon of
non-medical drug use. The inquiry between the interim report and
the final report will test the definitions of issues and the
hypotheses reflected in the interim report, add necessary
information with respect to the effects, the extent, and the
causes of non-medical drug use, as well as the role played by the
various aspects of social control and response, and lay the
foundation for specific recommendations concerning these various
aspects. The interim report is primarily concerned with a
statement of the issues and applicable principles, and the final
report is to be concerned with the detailed application of these
principles to the development of a satisfactory system of social
response. </p>

<p>We recognize, however, that the urgency of some of the
problems involved in non-medical drug use and the time required
to develop adequate resources to cope with them may indicate the
appropriateness of certain recommendations at this time. This is
particularly true with respect to preparations and organization
for which considerable lead time is required. In such cases it
may be sufficient to indicate the general direction which certain
responses should take, leaving it to further study and
consultation in the ensuing year to settle matters of detail. </p>

<p>18. Chapter Two on the effect of the drugs is offered at this
time for two reasons. First, we have been profoundly impressed by
repeated assertions of the need for more reliable information,
and we hope that this chapter will serve a useful purpose as
material for drug education. Secondly, we feel that it is an
indispensable basis for the development of public understanding
of the issues. In effect, in Chapter Two we disclose our initial
assumptions concerning the effects of the drugs. Our </p>

<p>object is to identify the body of reliable and generally<b> </b>accepted
knowledge, and to determine where the important uncertainties and
gaps exist. We certainly concur in the impression which others
have conveyed of a field of knowledge bedevilled by controversy,
conflicting professional opinion, and uncertainty. Some observers
question whether it is possible, in view of the intense feelings
on this subject, ever to come to agreement on what should be
accepted as scientifically known. Erich Goode in his article,
'Marijuana and the Politics of Reality', observes that 'the
multitude of results from the many marijuana reports forms a sea
of ambiguity into which nearly any message may be read'. He makes
the point that whether a particular drug effect is good or bad
depends on one's subjective point of view - the implications of
the effect in term's of one's own system of values. Goode sees no
possible reconciliation of these <i>'</i>differential evaluations<i>
</i>of the same &quot;objective&quot; consequences', and he
concludes that 'the essential meaning of the marijuana issue is
the meaning which each individual brings to it'. The Addiction
Research Foundation of Ontario makes the same point in its
preliminary submission to the Commission. It puts the matter this
way: </p>

<p>However, after all possible information has been acquired and
verified scientifically, the final steps in the formulation of
legislation or governmental policy will be based upon value
judgements. Even the classification of the effects of drug use as
'beneficial' or 'adverse' is a process of evaluation with respect
to subjective standards. </p>

<p>The response to non-medical drug use is profoundly a matter of
attitudes. At the same time we must make every effort to
ascertain what should be accepted as scientific knowledge of the
'objective' effects. It is intolerable that the process of
subjective evaluation should take place in ignorance of the
objective facts. At the same, we would do well to heed Goode's
caution that there is an inevitable tendency to select and
emphasize those views of 'objective' facts which support our own
subjective evaluation. And as Goode points out, with special
reference to the La Guardia Report on marijuana, the various
findings can be used to support conflicting points of view. Are
we to conclude that the task is hopeless? We think not. We can
certainly make progress by attempting to identify what should be
accepted scientifically concerning the 'objective' effects, by
pointing out the important areas of scientific controversy or<b> </b>lack
of scientific knowledge, and by making explicit the value
judgements underlying the conflicting views as to how the effects
should be subjectively characterized. We believe it is helpful to
clarify the issues of the debate. </p>

<h3>Staff and Research </h3>

<p>19. The members of the Commission and their staff are listed
in Appendix C. The Commission is carrying out its task with a
small nucleus of full-time staff and with research consultants on
a part-time basis for special aspects of its study. The
Commission's Research Associates, Dr Charles Farmilo and Dr Ralph
D. Miller, are concentrating on<b> </b>psychopharmacological
research into the effects of the drugs. Dr Miller is the author,
with the assistance of Dr Farmilo, of Chapter Two on 'The Drugs
and Their Effects'. Research that has been commissioned so far
includes survey research to determine the extent and patterns of
non-medical drug use in Canada, as well as Canadian perceptions
of and attitudes towards this phenomenon, and legal studies, both
doctrinal and empirical, of the various problems involved in the
regulation of non-medical drug use. The section of Chapter Five
dealing with the law is based in part on preliminary work by
Professor Paul Weiler and John Hogarth. </p>

<p>Research is only part of the work that is involved in an
inquiry of this kind. Special mention should be made of the
administrative staff who have had to work under particular
pressure because of the requirement of an interim report,
impinging concurrently with the organization and conduct of the
public hearings. We would like to express our appreciation of the
work of Mr James J. Moore, Executive-Secretary of the Commission,
who has had the general direction of operations and who has also
participated in the writing of the report; Mr Jack Macbeth, who
has been of great assistance in the organization of hearings and
the preparation of the report; Mrs Vivian Luscombe who has
supervised the secretarial staff of the Commission; Mr C. William
Doylend, the Ottawa Office Manager, and other members of the
administrative, secretarial and research staff. <br>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO : THE DRUGS AND THEIR EFFECTS </h2>

<p>INTRODUCTION </p>

<p>20. The primary purpose of this chapter is to review in
preliminary fashion the current scientific knowledge of certain
psychotropic drugs used non-medically in Canada. In addition,
this section will introduce a few basic concepts which may be
helpful to the understanding of some of the potentials and
limitations of the scientific method as applied to the study of
human behaviour and drugs.* Psychopharmacology, the branch of
science specifically concerned with these issues, can be defined
as the study of the interaction of drugs with ongoing
psychological and behavioural activity. </p>

<p>A certain amount of the current controversy and lack of
communication regarding the 'drug problem' has been attributed to
the multitude of meanings that the term 'drug' has to different
people, and to the often arbitrary way in which our society
defines, and endeavours to solve, the problems arising from man's
persistent use of chemical substances to alter his existence. To
some people the word 'drug' means a medicine used in the
prevention, diagnosis, of treatment of an abnormal or
pathological condition. In other situations, it is often used to
refer only to illegal or socially disapproved substances. Some
individuals employ the word in a manner suggesting dependence or
addiction, regardless of whether it refers to some chemical
substance or to other preoccupations such as television, music,
books, or sports and games. Some consider alcohol, tea and coffee
as drugs, while to others these are simply normal beverages not
to be confused with the more foreign and unfamiliar substances
viewed as drugs. Furthermore, the terms 'drug' and 'narcotic' are
given special meanings in legal areas. </p>

<p>* A glossary of technical terms, as used in this report, is
presented at the end of this volume. </p>

<p>Even scientists frequently disagree as to the precise
definition of the term 'drug'. </p>

<p>Modell164 has suggested a comprehensive pharmacological
definition of drugs which the Commission has adopted. As noted in
Chapter One, a <i>drug </i>is considered to be any <i>substance
that by its chemical nature alters structure or function in the
living organism. </i>Modell observed that: </p>

<p>Drug action is therefore a general biological phenomenon ...
pharmacologic effects are exerted by foods, vitamins, hormones,
microbial metabolites, plants, snake venoms, stings, products of
decay, air pollutants, pesticides, minerals, synthetic chemicals,
virtually all foreign materials (very few are completely inert)
and many materials normally in the body. </p>

<p>While this interpretation may be too broad for certain
practical purposes, it provides some perspective into the
ubiquitous nature of our internal and external chemical
environment, and the complexity of the question of human drug
use. The Commission's primary concern is focused on the use and
effects of drugs taken for their <i>psychotropic or psychoactive </i>properties
as defined by their capacity to <i>alter sensation, mood,
consciousness or other psychological or behavioural functions.</i>
</p>

<p>21. The use of psychoactive drugs seems to be an almost
universal phenomenon and has apparently occurred throughout
recorded history, in almost all societies. Some scholars have
suggested that this use of drugs may have been among the earliest
behavioural characteristics distinguishing man from the other
animals. Blum, in the United States <i>Task Force Report </i>(1967),
has stated:27 </p>

<p>Mind-altering drug use is common to mankind. Such drugs have
been employed for millennia in almost all cultures. In our work
we have been able to identify only a few societies in the world
today where no mind-altering drugs are used; these are small and
isolated cultures. Our own society puts great stress on
mind-altering drugs as desirable products which are used in many
acceptable ways (under medical supervision, as part of the family
home remedies, in self-medication, in social use [alcohol, tea
parties, coffee klatches, etc.] and in private use [cigarettes,
etc.] ). In terms of drug use, 'the rarest or most abnormal form
of behaviour is not to take any mind-altering drugs at all.... If
one is to use the term 'drug user', it applies to nearly all of
us. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">The
Role of Science </h3>

<p>22. It has been suggested that the potential role of science
in the solution of the 'drug problem' is to provide information
to better enable individuals and society to make informed and
discriminating decisions regarding the availability and use of
particular drugs. Unfortunately, considerable disparity often
exists between the need for such information and the capacity of
science to acquire and communicate it. </p>

<p>Helen Nowlis has noted: 172 </p>

<p>There are many reasons why the 'facts' invoked in
non-scientific discussions of drugs are often not facts at all.
They may be second or third-hand quotations of statements
attributed to scientists. There is a readiness on the part of
many to accept as 'scientific fact' any statement made by, or
attributed to, someone labelled as scientist, whether it is a
statement based on research, on uncontrolled observation, or
merely on personal opinion. </p>

<p>While science may be able to serve as a useful guideline and
source of information, science itself is not a policy-making
process, but merely a practical system designed to explore and
test notions of a certain abstract nature. Even though the aim of
science is to maximize objectivity, the interpretation and
application of scientific data is usually a subjective venture
regardless of the controls maintained in the formal analyses. The
practical use of such information in the social sphere often
entails economic, legal, philosophical and moral issues which are
not amenable to scientific analysis as we know it today. </p>

<p>Even though considerable progress has been made in advancing
our knowledge of biology, science has provided only a minimal
understanding of the essential nature of psychological and
behavioural functions and their relationship to underlying
physiological processes. Consequently, psychopharmacology today
must be content with exploring the interaction of chemicals
(often with certain identified physical characteristics) with a
largely unknown largely unknown human psychobiological system of
enormous complexity. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">The
Classification of Drugs </h3>

<p>23. Drug classifications, based on a variety of different
considerations have been developed and there appears to be little
general agreement as to the optimal scheme for ordering the
universe of biologically active substances. For example, drugs
might be organized according to chemical structure,
clinical-therapeutic use, potential health hazards, liability to
non-medical use, public availability and legality, effects on
specific neural or other physiological systems, or influence on
certain psychological and behavioural processes. The
classification systems developed from these different approaches
may show considerable overlap, although there are often striking
incongruities. For example, some drugs which appear very similar
in chemical structure may be quite different in pharmacological
activity and vice-versa. The most useful organization depends on
the intended use of the classifications. </p>

<p>Since our major concern here is with the effects of
psychologically active substances, our interim drug
classification system is based primarily on general psychological
and pharmacological considerations. In Table I eight major
classes are presented along with some examples of drugs from each
group. While the categories are not considered to be exhaustive,
the general system is applicable to the majority of drugs used
for their psychological effects. Since the effects of drugs
depend on a vast number of psychological and physiological
components, many of which seem unpredictable, these categories
are to some extent based on a typical reaction by an average
subject to a common dose. Large variations in any of various
factors can greatly alter the effects and may reduce the
reliability of the descriptions. </p>

<p>(b) Little or no medical use. </p>

<p>(c) Wide medical use, and little or no non-medical use </p>

<p>* Registered Trade Name </p>

<p>24. The <i>sedatives</i> and <i>hypnotics</i> (e.g., alcohol,
barbiturates, 'sleeping pills' and minor tranquillizers)
generally decrease central nervous system (CNS) arousal (although
some psychological stimulation may result at low doses). Most of
these drugs are used medically to reduce anxiety and tension, to
produce general sedation and, at higher doses, sleep. The
anticholinergic substances (e.g., belladonna alkaloids) are often
used as sedatives at low doses although larger amounts may
produce excitation and delirium. </p>

<p>25. The <i>stimulants </i>(e.g., amphetamines or 'speed',
'diet' and 'pep pills', caffeine, and cocaine) generally suppress
appetite, increase activity, alertness, tension and general CNS
arousal, and, at higher doses, block sleep. Tobacco (nicotine and
coal tars) is usually considered a physiological stimulant
although a variety of other effects are not uncommon. </p>

<p>26. The third group includes drugs described as <i>psychedelic
</i>(mind-manifesting), <i>hallucinogenic </i>(hallucination-producing),
<i>psychotomimetic </i>(psychosis-imitating), <i>illusinogenic </i>(illusion-producing),
and <i>psychodysleptic </i>(mind-disrupting). While these terms
refer to somewhat overlapping effects alleged to occur with the
drugs in this class, the various labels emphasize different
characteristics which are neither synonymous nor necessarily
mutually exclusive. Probably none are entirely adequate as
descriptive terms. These drugs may produce profound alteration in
sensation, mood and consciousness at doses which result in
comparatively light physiological activity . LSD and marijuana
are examples from this group. The medical value of these drugs is
the subject of considerable current controversy. </p>

<p>27. The drugs in the fourth category have, traditionally been
referred to as narcotics or opiates, and are derivatives of, or
pharmacologically related to, products of the opium plant. The
best known examples are heroin, morphine and codeine. The word
'narcotic' has been used inconsistently in scientific as well as
lay language and has been the subject of considerable
disagreement in legal matters (for example, marijuana, cocaine,
and other non-opiates are frequently controlled under laws
regulating narcotics, in spite of the fact that they are
pharmacologically different from this group). The use of the term
'opiates' is generally more specific, although its application
has not always been limited to these drugs. Consequently, the
specific term <i>opiate narcotics </i>is suggested to reduce
ambiguity. These drugs are used medically mainly for their
pain-relieving effects. </p>

<p>28. The fifth group is an aggregate of chemically diverse
substances perhaps best described on a physical basis as <i>volatile
solvents. </i>They are usually inhaled and include the vapour of
such common materials as glue, gasoline and lacquer thinner. Some
of these drugs have been called <i>deliriants </i>although
delirium is only one of many potential effects and is clearly not
restricted to these substances. Many are quite similar in effect
to the sedative group and might be considered in a sub-class of
that category. Others may have slight psychedelic or
hallucinogenic effects. Most of these substances have no known
medical use although several have been employed as clinical
anaesthetics. </p>

<p>29. The <i>non-narcotic analgesics </i>(e.g., Aspirin* and
Phenacetin*) are primarily used to reduce aching pain and to
lower fever. In some instances they may also serve as mild
sedatives. </p>

<p>30. The <i>clinical anti-depressants </i>(e.g., Tofranil* and
Nardil*) are used medically to improve mood in severely depressed
patients. These drugs are rarely used for non-medical purposes
since they have little effect on normal mood states. </p>

<p>31. The final group, the <i>major tranquillizers, </i>are
primarily used to reduce the symptoms of severe psychosis (e.g.,
schizophrenia). Largactil* and reserpine are examples. While
these have initiated a widespread revolution in chemo-therapy in
psychiatry, they are rarely involved in non-medical use. </p>

<p>* Throughout this chapter an asterisk indicates a registered
drug trade name. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Psychological
Considerations </h3>

<p>32. The general effect of most drugs is greatly influenced by
a variety of psychological and environmental factors. Unique
qualities of an individual's personality, his past history of
drug experience, his attitudes towards the drug, his expectations
of its effects and his motivation for taking it are extremely
important and in some instances may completely obscure the
typical pharmacological response to a drug. These factors are
often referred to collectively as the person's mental 'set'. 'The
'setting' or total environment in which the drug is taken may
also be a factor of major significance. </p>

<p>A few drinks of alcohol may produce drowsiness and fatigue in
some situations, while the same individual under different
circumstances may be psychologically stimulated and aroused by
the same dose. It appears that the set and setting may be of
greater significance with the psychedelic-hallucinogenic
substances than with the other drugs, and it has been suggested
that psychological factors may often be the primary components in
determining the quality or character of the psychedelic drug
experience. </p>

<p>The so-called <i>placebo effect </i>is a striking example of
the importance of set and setting in determining the drug
response. A placebo, in this context, refers to a
pharmacologically inactive substance which elicits a significant
reaction, entirely because of what the individual expects or
desires to happen. In certain individuals in some settings a
placebo substance may have surprisingly powerful consequences.
The placebo effect is specific to the individual and the setting,
and not to any chemical properties of the substance involved.
Therefore, in spite of an apparent 'drug effect', the placebo is
not considered a drug since it does not alter function 'by its
chemical nature'. </p>

<p>Placebos have been reported in therapeutic situations to
significantly relieve such symptoms as headache and a variety of
other pains, hay fever, colds, seasickness, neuroses, and a
number of gastrointestinal complaints.97 Some scientists have
suggested that the bulk of medical history may actually have been
a history of the placebo, since many 'effective cures' of the
past have been shown to be without relevant direct
pharmacological action, and are today of no value as therapeutic
agents. </p>

<p>To control for the influence of such psychological factors in
drug research, testing is usually done under at least two
conditions: an assessment is made using the actual drug of
interest, and a separate measurement is taken after a placebo is
given under identical circumstances. By comparing these two
conditions some of the effects of set and setting can often be
controlled and the actual drug effect uncovered. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Pharmacological
Considerations </h3>

<p>33. In studying how drugs affect the body, pharmacologists
generally divide the analysis into several processes: </p>

<p>1. <i>Administration: </i>how does the drug enter the body? </p>

<p>2. <i>Absorption: </i>how does the drug get from the site of
administration into the physiological system of the body? </p>

<p>3. <i>Distribution: </i>how is the drug distributed to various
areas in the body? </p>

<p>4. <i>Action: </i>how and where does the drug produce what
effects? </p>

<p><i>5.</i> <i>Physiological Fate: </i>how is the drug
inactivated, metabolized, and/or eliminated from the body? </p>

<p>Different routes or modes of administration can have
considerable influence on the latency, duration, intensity and
the general nature of the drug effect. Many drugs are well
absorbed from the stomach and intestines after ingestion while
others are poorly taken up or may be destroyed by the gastric
juices. Certain drugs may be injected, with a hypodermic syringe
for example, just under the skin (subcutaneous or S.C,), into the
muscle (intramuscular or I.M.), or into a blood vein (intravenous
or I.V.). The effects are generally most rapid and intense after
intravenous injection and, consequently, this mode of
administration can be quite dangerous in inexperienced hands. In
addition, certain volatile substances can be rapidly and
efficiently absorbed from the lungs by inhalation. </p>

<p>34. The action of a drug is in many cases terminated by
chemical changes which it undergoes in the body, Certain organs
(often the liver) metabolize or 'break down' the original
substance into other chemicals which are usually (but not always)
less active and more easily eliminated from the body. Some drugs
may be excreted unchanged in the urine, faeces, or breath. Action
is not always terminated by excretion, however, and the effects
of some drugs greatly outlast the actual presence of the chemical
in the body. Numerous physiological factors alter absorption,
distribution, action and fate, and must therefore be taken into
consideration in the study of drug effects. </p>

<p>The details of cellular physiology are largely unknown and
with rare exceptions there is little information as to the
mechanism by which any particular drug changes the activity of
the nervous system. At the simplest level, it appears that a drug
alters the functioning of the living cell by entering into some
sort of chemical combination with substances already present.
Even if this molecular process were well understood, it would not
provide a straightforward basis for predicting the overall
effects of the drug on a group of interacting cells, or, at
higher level, on the total nervous system (comprising billions of
cells) and associated psychological and behavioural processes. </p>

<p><i>35. The importance of dose. </i>One of the basic principles
of pharmacology is that specific statements about drug effects
can not be made without consideration of the quantity or dose of
the drug involved. With all drugs, the response differs both in
the intensity and the character of the reaction, according to the
amount of the drug administered. The relation between the dose
and the intensity of an effect is often referred to by scientists
as the <i>dose-response or dose-effect relationship.</i> </p>

<p>Although the magnitude of the effects of some drugs may
increase in a rather uniform (monotonic) fashion as dose is
increased, other drugs, particularly the sedatives, may show a <i>bi-phasic
response </i>and actually produce behaviourally opposite effects
at some doses compared to others. Low doses of alcohol may, in
certain instances, be somewhat stimulating, while higher doses
generally have a strong sedating effect. Scopolamine (a
belladonna alkaloid) may produce sedation at low doses, and
excitation, delirium and hallucinations with larger quantities.
Very toxic doses of this drug can again produce sedation, coma
and even death. </p>

<p>For every drug there is a dose low enough so as to produce<b> </b>no
noticeable reaction, and at the opposite extreme, some degree of
toxicity or poisoning can be produced by any substance if enough
is taken. The concept of a poison, in fact, really refers to the
quantity of a drug which exceeds the body's capacity to cope with
it without damage. No drug can be designated either safe,
beneficial, or harmful without consideration of the dose likely
to be consumed. Chlorine, for example, which is present in most
urban drinking water in concentration so low as to have little or
no pharmacological effect on humans, is intended to poison
harmful bacteria. The same substance, highly concentrated in
gaseous form, was developed during World War I as an extremely
potent respiratory poison. Even the concept of a psychotropic
drug implies some notion of the range of doses likely to be
consumed, since almost any drug can, in high quantities, affect
psychological function. In many instances, however, considerable
physical toxicity or poisoning develops before significant
psychological effects occur. </p>

<p>It is usually essential to study a drug's effect over a range
of doses in order to obtain an adequate understanding of the
nature of the response. It is also important to consider doses
which have some relevance to existing or potential patterns of
use if social implications are to be inferred from experimental
findings. </p>

<p><i>36. The importance of time. </i>Another important
pharmacological concept is the <i>time-response relationship </i>or
the relation between the time which has elapsed since
administration and the effect produced. Such a temporal analysis
may be restricted to immediate or short-term (acute) effects of a
single dose, or on the other extreme, may involve the long-term
effects of persistently repeated (chronic) use of a drug. </p>

<p>The intensity and often the character or quality of the
overall drug effect may change substantially within a short
period of time. For example, the main intoxicating effects of a
large dose of alcohol generally reach a peak in less than an
hour, then gradually taper off. An initially stimulating effect
may later change to one of sedation. With some drugs, an initial
state of tension or anxiety may later turn into one of relaxation
and sense of well-being, or vice-versa, as a function of time. </p>

<p>It may also be important with some drugs to consider the
long-term consequences of chronic use. Usually such effects can
not be readily predicted from what is known of the immediate
response. For instance, while there is little doubt that the
smoking of a few tobacco cigarettes has no lasting detrimental
effect on lung or cardiac function, there is increasing
scientific evidence that long-term heavy use of this substance
has serious consequences. As another example, the clinical
picture of the chronic alcoholic involves psychological and
physiological disturbances which do not develop with moderate
drinking. In simple terms, it is essential to ask: 'How much?';
'How often?'; and 'For how long?' (as well as 'By whom?') when
discussing the long-term reaction to repeated drug use. </p>

<p>37. <i>Main effects and side effects. </i>It is highly
unlikely that any drug has only a single action on a particular
behavioural or physiological function. Most drugs can produce an
almost unlimited number of effects on the body, each with a
somewhat unique dose-response and time-response relationship. The
relative strength of the different responses to a drug generally
varies with the amount taken, and a particular effect which is
prominent at one dosage level may be quite secondary at another. </p>

<p>In a therapeutic or clinical setting, one is usually
interested in a single or perhaps a small number of the many
possible effects. Those which are desired are generally
considered 'main effects' whilst the other unwanted but
concurrent drug responses are labelled 'side effects'. This
distinction between main and side effects is a relative one and
depends on the purpose or the anticipated use of the drug. A
response which is considered unnecessary or undesirable in one
application may, in fact, be the main or desired effect in
another. For example, in the clinical treatment of severe pain,
the analgesic (pain-reducing) properties of morphine are
considered the main effect, and the psychological euphoria and
the intestinal constipation also produced are undesirable side
effects. To the 'street addict', however, the euphoric properties
are the main effects, and the analgesic and constipating effects
may be irrelevant or undesired. Certain opiate compounds such as
paregoric are used in treatment of diarrhoea and, in this
instance, the constipating effect of the drug is desired and the
other responses are considered side effects. It is universal that
drugs have undesirable and toxic side effects if the dose is
sufficiently increased. </p>

<p><i>38. Drug interaction. </i>Even in cases where the
individual effects of different drugs are well known and
reliable, if several substances are taken at the same time, tile
interaction may produce a response which is quite unpredictable
on the basis of the knowledge of the individual drugs alone. Less
commonly, a particular interaction effect may be anticipated. If
the drugs normally have similar properties, they may often have
an additive effect if taken together, resulting in a general
increase in responses similar to that produced by a larger single
dose of either one. There are also instances in which one drug
may potentiate the action of another, and the two together
produce a greater effect than would be expected by merely adding
the individual reactions. Furthermore, some drugs have
antagonistic effects, and one may counteract or inhibit certain
normal responses to the other. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Tolerance
and Dependence </h3>

<p>38a<i>. Tolerance is said to develop when the response to the
same dose of a drug decreases with repeated use. </i>With most
tolerance-producing drugs, effects of original intensity can be
retained. to a certain extent, if the dose is increased. The
extent of tolerance, and the rate at which it is acquired, depend
on the drug, the individual using it, and the magnitude and
frequency of administration. The body does not lose sensitivity
to all aspects of the reaction to a particular drug with equal
rapidity, or to the same degree. Some of the effects of a drug
may 'drop out' sooner than others with repeated use. Tolerance to
the effects which are reinforcing or rewarding drug use (i.e.,
'main effects') is usually reflected by a tendency for users to
increase dose. Most aspects of tolerance dissipate with
abstinence from the drug. </p>

<p>A moderate degree of tolerance to most effects of alcohol and
barbiturates develops and a heavy drinker may be able to consume
two to three times the alcohol tolerated by a novice. Little
tolerance develops to the lethal toxicity of these drugs,
however, and a heavy user of sedatives is just as susceptible to
death by overdose as is a non-tolerant individual. Opiate
narcotics, such as morphine, are capable of producing profound
tolerance, and heavy users have been known to take up to ten
times the amount which would normally produce death. By contrast,
no noticeable tolerance develops to cocaine (a short-acting
stimulant). </p>

<p>The exact mechanisms by which the body adapts, or becomes
tolerant, to different drug effects are not completely
understood, although several processes have been suggested.
Certain drugs (e.g., barbiturates) stimulate the body's
production of the metabolic enzymes which inactivate them. In
addition, there is evidence that a considerable degree of central
nervous system (CNS) tolerance may develop to certain drugs
independent of changes in the rate of absorption, metabolism or
excretion. An individual tolerant to alcohol, for example, can be
relatively unaffected by a large dose even though the resulting
high level of alcohol in his blood may accurately reflect the
magnitude of his intake. It is uncertain as to whether this
represents some general molecular adaptation to the drug at the
level of the individual nerve cell, or perhaps a specific
response by the central nervous system to counteract the sedating
effects and maintain normal function. Learning factors often
appear to play an important role in changing the individual's
response to a drug after experience with it. Effects which
initially may be strange or frightening may later be accepted
without reaction or concern, or perhaps, even be desired. There
is evidence that people may learn to control some drug effects,
or otherwise come to function normally in the presence of certain
responses which might originally have been distracting, or
otherwise disrupting of behaviour. </p>

<p>A phenomenon often referred to as 'reverse tolerance' has been
noted with some drugs (notably the psychedelics) in which the
desired effects may be achieved with smaller doses after
experience with the drug. Both learning and pharmacological
mechanisms have been suggested to underly this process. </p>

<p>In many instances, after an individual becomes tolerant to the
effects of one drug, he will also show tolerance to others with
similar action. This is called <i>cross-tolerance. </i>For
example, a heavy drinker will normally show a reduced response to
barbiturates, tranquillizers and anaesthetics, as well as to
alcohol. </p>

<p>39.<i> Physical dependence is a physiological state of
adaptation to a</i><b> </b><i>drug, normally following the
development of tolerance, which results in a characteristic set
of withdrawal symptoms (often called the 'abstinence syndrome'),
when administration of the drug is stopped. </i>These symptoms
may be of an intense nature after persistent heavy use, and with
some sedatives and opiate narcotics, may include tremors,
vomiting, delirium, cramps and, in severe cases with some drugs,
convulsions and death. There are generally no overt signs of
physical dependence if the drug level is kept high enough to
avoid the withdrawal syndrome. In a sense, the body comes to
depend on the drug for 'normal' functioning after adapting to its
presence, and when the drug is absent, considerable disruption of
essential physiological processes occurs until readjustment
develops. The withdrawal syndrome may also he elicited without
abstinence, by the administration of a substance which
specifically antagonizes or blocks certain effects of the
original drug. </p>

<p>Withdrawal symptoms can be prevented or promptly relieved by
the administration of a sufficient quantity of the original drug
or one with similar pharmacological activity. The latter case, in
which different drugs can be used interchangeably in preventing
withdrawal symptoms, is called <i>cross-dependence. </i>As an
example, barbiturates and tranquillizers can be used in treating
the abstinence syndrome associated with chronic alcoholism. </p>

<p>Often the recovery phase associated with different drugs is<i>
</i>characterized by a rebound phenomenon dominated by activity
opposite to that produced by the drug. For instance, withdrawal
from the sedatives generally results in symptoms of acute and
toxic hyperactivation and physiological arousal, while the
pattern following intense stimulant (e.g. 'speed') use usually
involves sedation, depression and sleep. </p>

<p>Although physical dependence can develop with such common
drugs as alcohol and barbiturates, it is not a factor in the
drug-taking behaviour of the vast majority of regular users. In
the few individuals who become physically dependent on these
particular drugs, serious social, personal and physiological
consequences of drug use usually precede the physical dependence.
Therefore, although physical dependence is a serious medical
problem in a minority of sedative users, the abstinence syndrome
itself is not the cause of major public health problems. The
potent opiate narcotics, by contrast, tend to produce very
pronounced tolerance and physical dependence early in the history
of regular use. These features then soon become an integral part
of the particular drug problem presented by the opiate narcotics.
However, with these and other drugs, psychological factors in the
dependence are often more significant in the long run. </p>

<p><i>40. Psychological dependence </i>(also often called
behavioural, psychic or emotional dependence, and habituation) is
a much more elusive concept and is difficult to define in a
satisfactory manner. A World Health Organization paper69 defines
psychic dependence thus: 'In this situation there is a feeling of
satisfaction and a psychic drive that require periodic or
continuous administration of the drug to produce a desired effect
or to avoid discomfort.' A major problem with this definition is
the difficulty in operationally defining and objectively
identifying the characteristics of the dependence in a practical
situation. </p>

<p>By contrast, some scientists224 have identified behavioural
dependence as repeated self-administration of a drug. This
approach seems far too broad for most purposes since it only
indicates that the drug is in some way reinforcing or rewarding
to the user, and merely restates the observation that he takes
the drug. </p>

<p>Extreme instances of psychological dependence are easier to
identify and may be characterized by an intense craving for, or
compulsion to continue the use of, a drug with obvious
behavioural manifestations. In many instances, psychological
aspects may be considerably more important than physical
dependence in maintaining chronic drug use. The major problem
with opiate dependence is not the physical aspects, since
withdrawal can be successfully achieved in a few weeks, but the
great likelihood that the individual will later return to chronic
use due to psychological dependence. </p>

<p>In most instances of even regular non-medical use of drugs,
such intense psychological dependence probably does not occur.
However, more subtle psychological and social factors usually
have persisting effects in maintaining the behaviour of drug
consumption. </p>

<p>In talking about dependency in any context, whether dealing
with drugs or not, it would seem useful to specify what it is
that is being depended upon and for what reasons, and to identify
the consequences of its presence or its absence. The significance
of dependency changes considerably if the entity is relied upon,
for example, for the maintenance of life (e.g., insulin for the
diabetic) or for the escape from an unpleasant or intolerable
situation (e.g., privacy), or perhaps for a feeling of well-being
or satisfaction with life. In one sense psychological dependence
may be said to exist with respect to anything which is part of
one's preferred way of life. In our society, this kind of
dependency occurs regularly with respect to such things as
television, music, books, religion, sex, money, favourite foods,
certain drugs, hobbies, sports or games and, often, other
persons. Some degree of psychological dependence is, in this
sense, a general and normal psychological condition. </p>

<p>A statement in the preliminary brief of the Addiction Research
Foundation of Ontario reflects the complexity of interpreting the
question of dependency:4 </p>

<p>It should be recognized, however, that dependence is not
necessarily bad in itself, either for the individual or for
society. The question to he evaluated, therefore, is not whether
dependence can occur, but whether dependence in a given case
results in physical, psychological or social harm. </p>

<p><i>41. The concept of addiction. </i>The term 'addiction' has
had a variety of meanings, and a consensus as to the proper
definition seems unlikely, even in scientific circles. Often it
has been used interchangeably with dependence (psychological
and/or physiological), while at other times it appears to be
synonymous with the term 'drug abuse'. The classical model of the
addiction- producing drug was based on the opiate narcotics, and
has traditionally required the presence of tolerance, and
physical and psychological dependence. However, this approach has
not been generally satisfactory since only a few commonly used
drugs (e.g., alcohol and other sedatives), in addition to the
opiates, seem to fit the model at all. It is clearly
inappropriate for many other drugs which can cause serious
dependency problems. For example, amphetamines can produce
considerable tolerance and strong psychological dependence with
little or no physical dependence, and cocaine can produce
psychological dependence without tolerance or physical
dependence. Furthermore, in certain medical applications,
morphine has been reported to produce tolerance and physical
dependence without a significant psychological component. </p>

<p>Recognizing the problems with the concept of addiction, the
World Health Organization (WHO) proposed the following:69 </p>

<p>It has become impossible in practice, and is scientifically
unsound, to maintain a single definition for all forms of drug
addiction and/or habituation. A feature common to these
conditions as well as to drug abuse in general is dependence,
psychic or physical or both, of the individual on a chemical
agent. Therefore, better understanding should be attained by
substitution of the term drug dependence of this or that type,
according to the agent or class of agents involved.... It must be
emphasized that drug dependence is a general term that has been
selected for its applicability to all types of drug abuse and
thus carries no connotation of the degree of risk to public
health or need for any or a particular type of drug control. </p>

<p>The WHO committee presented short descriptions of various
different types of drug dependence which may occur<b> </b>in some
individuals and situations. The list identifies drug dependence
of the morphine type, the barbiturate - alcohol type, the cocaine
type, the cannabis (marijuana) type, the amphetamine type, the
khat type, and the hallucinogen (LSD) type. Details of<b> </b>these
various kinds of drug dependence are discussed separately later
in this chapter. </p>

<p>For reasons analogous to those presented above, it is further
suggested here that the term dependent rather than the ambiguous
description 'addict' be used to refer to aft individual who has
developed drug dependence of either the physical or psychological
forms. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Scientific
Methods </h3>

<p>42<i>. The role of statistics. </i>Statistics can be helpful
in collecting and handling numerical or quantified information,
interpreting data, and making inferences or generalizations from
it. The simplest use of statistics is to describe or summarize
certain abstract characteristics of a group or sample. For
example, the average height of players on a basketball team
provides a shorthand description of the group. The numerical mean
is a common index of the average. Considerably more information
could be communicated if some idea of the variability of heights
within the team were known. The range of measures, for example,
is a crude index of the variance of 'spread' in the distribution
within a group. </p>

<p>A second function of statistics is to provide a system for
inference about some population on the basis of a smaller group
or sample selected from that population. For example, the mean
I.Q. of a group of 50 students randomly selected from a school
with 500 individuals might provide a reasonable estimate of the
average intelligence of the entire student population of that
school. The success of such generalization or extrapolation
depends on the relative size of the sample and the accuracy or
fidelity with which the group studied represents the overall
population of interest. Any bias in sampling which reduces the
similarity between the selected group and the population to which
the results are to be generalized reduces the validity of such
extrapolation. </p>

<p>Statistics may also assist in distinguishing between the
differences in measurements resulting from random variation and
the variance due to the factor which is being studied. By
obtaining an estimate of the natural variability in a population,
it may be possible to distinguish, with some confidence, between
a 'real effect' associated with a particular condition or
treatment, and the difference which might be expected by chance
alone. The phrase 'statistically significant' is used to indicate
an effect considered significantly greater than that likely due
to chance. </p>

<p>However, statistical techniques alone can only indicate an
association between different variables and can not actually
identify cause and effect. Such causal inferences must be based
on an overall consideration of the research design. In many
laboratory experiments, the stimulus and its response may be
readily identified, but in less tightly controlled social studies
(e.g., surveys) and clinical observations, it is often very
difficult or impossible to positively identify the causal
variable in a complex pattern of associations among different
characteristics of the sample. For example, the demonstration
that persons who are heavy users of tranquillizers also tend to
be regular alcohol drinkers does not necessarily indicate that
one causes the other. It may well be that a third factor (e.g.,
the desire to avoid or<i> </i>escape anxiety and tension) may be
responsible for both behaviours. Interpretation of the data
generally requires considerations beyond that involved in the
statistical analysis. </p>

<p>43. <i>Experimental methods. </i>Details of research design
would not be appropriate here, although some simple notions as to
elementary requirements for adequate experimental techniques in
psychopharmacology may be worthwhile. A major goal of scientific
research is to eliminate or control all factors, other than those
to be studied, which can influence or bias measurement. </p>

<p>As discussed above, the subjects of the study must be
sufficiently similar to the general population of ultimate
interest to allow generalization from the data. Extrapolation
from one animal species to another, from one human society to
another, or from one social group<b> </b>to another is often
quite tenuous and must be viewed with extreme caution. Variables
such as age, sex, and social class often exert considerable
influence on psychological measures, and must be taken into
careful consideration. </p>

<p>Unless there is some reason why a particular dose level is of <i>singular
</i>significance, more than one dose should be studied. If the
purpose of the experiment is to allow inferences of a general
social nature, then the dose, mode of administration and the
general circumstances of the study must be relevant to the
pattern of use in the general population. </p>

<p>In order to determine the effect of a particular treatment, it
is necessary to have a reference or control condition for
comparison, which has been treated identically to the
experimental condition except for the factor under analysis.
These data may be obtained from a separate group of control
subjects, which is sufficiently similar to the experimental
group, or from the same subjects studied at a different time. Due
to the great variation between individuals in response to drugs,
the latter approach is often most efficient, although it is
sometimes inappropriate or impractical. Using subjects as their
own controls requires special statistical techniques for handling
the data, since repeated experience in the situation will affect
the subject's subsequent performance through such mechanisms as
general adaptation, practice and other learning variables, and
often fatigue. </p>

<p>Care must be taken to control or eliminate the possible
effects of the subject's and researcher's expectations and
biases. Since set and setting play an important role in
determining drug effects, an inactive placebo substance should be
tested in a control situation under conditions which are
identical to those present when the drug is studied. Sometimes,
however, if the subject has had previous experience with the
experimental drug, he may soon realize whether he was given the
active drug or an inactive substance despite his initial lack of
information, and consequently the placebo control may not be
complete. An experimental design in which the subject is not
informed as to which treatment is being investigated is called a <i>single-blind
</i>study. </p>

<p>Since the scientist's bias and expectations can also influence
the subject's performance and the interpretation of his behaviour
(as well as the later data analysis), the validity of the
measurements can often be further increased it the researcher is
also unaware of which treatment condition is in effect at the
time of the experiment. A study in which neither the subject nor
the researcher knows which of the experimental treatment
variables are operating is called a <i>double-blind </i>design.
There are certain circumstances where a double-blind is
inappropriate or impossible, although it is often the most
efficient way to acquire specific information about drug effects
in an experimental situation. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">A
Review of Selected Drugs </h3>

<p>44. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to a short
critical review of the scientific literature pertaining to the
effects of certain psychoactive drugs. Barbiturates, alcohol,
minor tranquillizers, amphetamines, LSD, cannabis, opiate
narcotics, and volatile solvents are discussed. In these interim
reviews an attempt has been made to concentrate on human
psychopharmacological studies rather than on animal experiments
or general social reports. Although original scientific sources
were sought and used as<b> </b>often as possible, it was
frequently necessary at this interim stage to rely on reviews
prepared by others. </p>

<p>There has been no attempt to be exhaustive in the references
presented in the text. These citations often indicate a typical
example chosen from among numerous sources which would have been
appropriate. The bibliography at the end of this chapter contains
a broader representation of some of the materials used in
