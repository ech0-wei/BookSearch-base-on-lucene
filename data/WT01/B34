<h1 align="center"><a name="OLE_LINK1">The Trouble with Surveys</a>
</h1>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Thomas L. Wayburn, PhD,
Executive Director</font> </p>

<h2>TELEPHONE SURVEYS </h2>

<p><font size="2">These share all of the difficulties of other
surveys besides being an incredible imposition upon the person
who is called. How does the surveyist know that the respondent is
not an insomniac who has gotten to sleep after three days of
torture followed by a remedy that has a window of opportunity to
act of five minutes, say, after which arousal means more
insomnia! How does the surveyist know that the respondent (the
person answering the call) is not the type of person who cannot
resist answering his phone because each call may be the golden
opportunity that knocks but once (or because of a compulsive
curiosity about who is calling him); so, even though he is on the
point of the greatest orgasm of his life, he stops everything and
picks up the devil's invention, the telephone! (Sometimes I think
the devil invented the computer too, and I am a computer expert.
But, this is only a metaphor.) Stephen Klineberg, who conducts
the Houston Area Survey out of the &quot;prestigious&quot; Rice
University, calls numbers at random, so even those with unlisted
numbers are not spared. All of this is reprehensible behavior.
But, don't worry, they'll get theirs.</font> </p>

<h2>OTHER SURVEYS, PARTICULARLY MAIL SURVEYS </h2>

<p><font size="2">These are usually worse than worthless besides
the trouble they cause. Of course, only idiots answer them, so
the opinions reflect those of the stupidest people in society, of
which the surveyist should be aware. In general (I mean without
exception), they are invalid for the purposes for which they
pretend to be intended. Usually, however, the last question is
&quot;Will you send us money?&quot;, so we understand their true
purpose. They are just another disgusting sales gimmick.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Let me illustrate with a survey I received from
the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF) only today. Basically, I favor
their cause, although they are extremely conservative in their
demands and have no philosophy worth mentioning. Presumably,
their real purpose is to make their leaders famous. (In America,
you are famous or you are no one.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 1</b><i>.</i> Some people believe
that heroin and marijuana should be available to citizens
suffering from painful and often terminal diseases. Should
doctors be allowed to prescribe such drugs in treating the pain
and suffering of cancer, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis and other
diseases?</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00001.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Yes. Sick people deserve to have whatever medicine is
available.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00002.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> No. Allowing sick people to have these drugs sends the
wrong message to the general public.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> If I answer yes, it means I
accept the medical monopoly on the distribution of drugs. I can't
answer no; that would be unconscionable.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 2.</b> The world honors the United
States as a country that respects its citizens and their rights
of privacy. Some people perceive that the search, seizure and
testing for drugs is undermining this American tradition. Do you
agree?</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00003.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Yes. The individual rights of our citizens are our most
important priority.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00004.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> No. Drugs are so dangerous we may need to sacrifice
some of our rights.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> I could answer with a yes;
however, a yes seems to indicate that I agree that the world does
indeed honor the U.S. as a country that respects etc. First, the
world does not honor; and, second, this is not a country that
respects ... But, suppose I were concerned about right-wing
militias and I approved of the BATF raids on their headquarters.
This is not the case, but suppose it were. I don't want just not
to be searched for drugs, I want equal rights for drug users - in
employment, housing, education, ... everything AND copious
reparations for the suffering I've had to endure because of these
draconian, immoral, and irrational laws.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 3.</b> We spend over $20 billion
each year on drug law enforcement - over two-thirds of the total
drug control budget. Should other methods such as treatment
programs and drug education be allocated a higher percentage of
that budget?</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00005.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Yes. Our tax money would be more effectively spent
funding treatment and prevention programs.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00006.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> No. We should continue funding punitive measures of
drug enforcement and build more jails.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> If I answer yes, I indicate
approval of treatment and prevention programs, which I thoroughly
discredited, along with some others, at the 1990 Drug Policy
Foundation. (Nevertheless, the foundation dishonestly persists in
its invalid policies - regardless of the outcome of the debates
at that meeting. The DPF has no intellectual integrity.) If I
answer no, I appear to support law enforcement, and I don't even
approve of the enforcement of the law against <b>murder</b>! In
fact, I know who killed one of my best friends and the police
will never find out from me. Never, but never, go to the police.
If you must, handle it yourself.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 4.</b> According to the Centers for
Disease Control, one-third of all AIDS cases started at the point
of a contaminated syringe shared between drug users. Should we
take action to prevent the spread of this deadly disease by
allowing IV drug users to exchange used syringes for sterile ones
at approved outlets?</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00007.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Yes. Preventing the spread of AIDS is more important
than a policy of zero drug tolerance of drug users.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00008.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> No. Providing IV drug users with sterile syringes sends
the wrong message.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> If I answer yes, I appear to
approve of control of some kind over the sale of syringes, which
I don't. The no answer is ridiculous and extremely cruel. In
fact, the &quot;wrong&quot; answers are purposely exaggerated to
make the &quot;sucker&quot; more willing to answer the crucial
seventh question &quot;right&quot;.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 5.</b> Drug-related theft, violence
and turf wars bring danger to our streets and harm many innocent
people, including our children. How do you think we should deal
with this growing problem?</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00009.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> By taking the profits away through the
decriminalization or legalization of some or all drugs.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00010.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> By being tougher with enforcement and doing whatever it
takes to get drugs out of our country.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00011.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> By developing new methods of control, education and
treatment.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> All three answers are
unacceptable. If you can sell anything for profit, you can sell
drugs. Actually, though, it's immoral to sell anything or, for
that matter, to accept a return for anything one does, gives, or
says, but one has to understand my entire philosophy to
understand that.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 6.</b> The most important policy
for the Drug Policy Foundation to work towards is (check one):</font>
</p>

<p><img src="IMG00012.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Making clean needles available to prevent the spread of
AIDS and other blood-borne diseases.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00013.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Making drugs like marijuana and opiates available to
the seriously ill.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00014.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Decriminalizing drug use.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00015.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Protecting individual rights of Americans.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> None of the above. The DPF
should adopt my policies for drug reform, which includes working
to eliminate capitalism and the profit motive and overthrowing
the government. Anything less is like pissing in the wind.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 7.</b> Will you support the Drug
Policy Foundation's efforts to mobilize the American people and
the Federal government to examine alternative solutions to the
drug crisis?</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00016.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Yes. Enclosed is my tax-deductible contribution of:</font>
</p>

<p><img src="IMG00017.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> $200 <img src="IMG00018.GIF" align="bottom" width="13"

Other</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(Please make your check payable to The Drug
Policy Foundation.)</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00025.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> No. I can't give my support to DPF at this time.
However, I am completing my 1995 Drug Policy Survey and have
enclosed a gift of $12.50 to help with the processing.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> What about the possibility
of sending what I can afford to send: a sincere criticism of the
DPF's policy. Why would not this be worth a fortune to a person
who wishes not to persist in error! An honest person would state
at the outset that this is an appeal for money, presumably to
make Arnold Trebach and Kevin Zeese as famous as they can arrange
to become. It's like the joke about the carpenter who was
informed about a good deed done by another carpenter. &quot;If he
did it,&quot; quoth the first carpenter, &quot;he did it to get
his name up.&quot; I am the outstanding thinker in drug policy of
whom I am aware and I read the two proceedings of the DPF
symposia that I attended from cover to cover. (I don't say this
out of egotism; it's a plain statement of fact.) Yet, I have
never received any recognition from Arnold, Kevin, or anyone in
the DPF. They are too busy looking out for themselves. Meanwhile,
mediocre individuals receive awards because the DPF gains more
from giving the award than the recipient does from getting it.
Don't worry, I don't bother with that. I don't accept awards. I
have written a short essay proving conclusively that they are
harmful and a significant part of THE problem and, therefore, a
significant part of the drug problem.</font> </p>

<h2>MARGIN OF ERROR </h2>

<p><font size="2">Typically, when the results of one of these
surveys is published, it comes with a margin of error. Frankly, I
don't know how this calculation is made - perhaps by partitioning
the data. The point is that the margin of error could be 100%
because everyone may give Answer A when they really mean Answer
B. It cannot be known how effective these polls are and my guess
is that they are considerably over-rated. In any case, they are a
public nuisance with few if any redeeming features in the vast
majority of cases. Moreover, I do not consider surveying to be a
qualified scholarly endeavor. In particular, college professors
should not be able to get away with calling it research.</font> </p>

<h2>IN WHICH I SAY NOT AT ALL NICE THINGS ABOUT MR. TYRRELL AND
FIND NO FAULT WITH MYSELF </h2>

<p><font size="2">&quot;No to Drug Legalization&quot; by R.
Emmett Tyrrell, Junior, is a short article that appeared in the <i>American
Spectator</i>. It does not have much substance and, in addition,
when it raises a point that needs to be proved, it refers
generally to what someone else has said. This is the weakest form
of argument. If a point is needed for the author's thesis, he
might have the courtesy to prove it rather than send the reader
off to yet another author, whose work may be troublesome to
obtain. However, the contentions are readily disproved or shown
to be irrelevant regardless of the arguments that appear
elsewhere in their defense. It is my job, then, to show that this
author has no case. On the other hand, my drug policy is
presented elsewhere and, since I am not compelled to prove
anything (merely disprove or discredit), a single literature
citation should satisfy the reader that I really have a position
on this subject that, by the way, fills the vacuum left by Mr.
Tyrrell rather nicely. Thus, I am really a creator primarily and
a destroyer only secondarily and then only in a very minor
capacity, as Mr. Tyrrell has not provided much of an edifice for
the wrecking ball.</font> </p>

<h2>IN WHICH I ALLOW MR. TYRRELL TO HANG HIMSELF </h2>

<p><font size="2">Tyrrell's argument, which I must assume is a
weak attempt at humor or, at least, jocularity, hinges on a
handful of statements that are either patently false, equivocal,
or irrelevant. I shall employ these statements as secondary
titles.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Drugs kill and enthrall. </h3>

<p><font size="2">The impression that Mr. Tyrrell wishes to
create is that drugs are lethal poison. Why, then, are they never
used to kill rats, insects, or ill-tempered wives? If the State,
itself, is doing the killing, the excessive cost due to
illegality would not obtain; nevertheless, illegal drugs are not
employed. If cocaine and heroin were lethal poisons, we would
have no addicts since users would expire before they became
addicted. While it is true that one can ingest enough of nearly
anything, even if it recognized as an essential nutrient, e.g.,
vitamin <img src="IMG00026.GIF" align="bottom" width="17"
height="18">, to cause death. The primary function of drugs is
not to kill, but to enhance joy, relieve pain, alleviate
discomfort, and to create altered states of consciousness, etc..
Death comes, in most cases, when the substance ingested is not
the substance expected or when the dosage is drastically
different from the dosage expected. These are accidents that do
not occur with legal drugs except in a few cases where the legal
drug is much more dangerous than the common favorite illegal
drugs most of which have been part of our culture for thousands
of years and with which we have vast experience. This is an
important point, namely, that cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and
even the relatively modern amphetamines are safer than many new
legal pharmaceuticals in proportion to our greater experience
with them, provided, of course, that we get what we expect to
get, a circumstance that we demand along with legalization.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Mr. Tyrrell employs the term enthralls
equivocally. Since we are enthralled by drugs as we would be by a
great love, it is easy to agree that these wonderful, miraculous,
divine drugs of antiquity have lost none of their charm with age.
It is as though our beloved were snatched from our arms when the
word is suddenly used to connote slavery, which we detest. We are
no more enslaved by our favorite drugs than we are by our
favorite foods - or, to bring home the sharp sword of truth, far
less than the average employed American is enslaved by his job.
The average drug user is free compared to the average corporate
employee. This is the beauty of Jack Nicholson's speech in the
pot smoking scene in the film <i>Easy Rider</i> when he tells the
bikers that the townspeople fear them because they represent
freedom. The druggies of the Beat Generation and subsequently
have been symbolic of man's quest for freedom. From among us come
the free spirits of the land. Only the oppressor's iron yoke can
bow the heads of those who dare to tread the paths of the
liberated criminal saints of the free-wheeling drug culture. The
whole world knows this is true.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">It is not as though a drug-free society takes
the fun out of life. Druggies are about as amusing as cadavers. </h3>

<p><font size="2">To take the last first, people don't take drugs
to amuse squares. As for the first, a drug-free America wouldn't
be worth living in. Not only would it take the fun out of life
for artists and other sensitive people, it would destroy nearly
everything else worth living for including closeness to the
transcendent - whether it's called God or nothing at all. Where
do these prudes and puritanical control freaks get the idea that
people take drugs exclusively, or even predominantly, for fun?
Mr. Tyrrell, once and for all, don't knock it until you try it.
And, by the way, stay out of my face. I am not bothering you or
interfering with your pursuit of happiness; however insane,
ridiculous, and misguided your recreational activities seem to be
from where I sit? For all I care, you can dress up in baby
clothes and have your maiden aunt push you around Central Park in
a perambulator. I won't call the cops. You strike me as the sort
of man who may have played golf. As much as I despise people for
taking so much space that should be available to children and
wildlife, I won't take it away from you until someone has no
place at all, be it man or beast.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Drugs are indulged in solely to escape from
reality. </h3>

<p><font size="2">How would you know? Drugs are &quot;indulged
in&quot; to paint pictures, write books, poems, and, yes, essays.
To play music, to have sex, to enjoy the company of one's friends
without a bunch of puritanical, middle-class hang-ups. To get
closer to God. And for more reasons than can be known in a
philosophy so pitifully tiny that it can be wedged into so narrow
a mind. Honestly, Emmett, you say the dumbest things.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">How many have left in their trail happy,
elegant works of art? (A rhetorical question asked without having
observed an artist at work - presumably.) </h3>

<p><font size="2">Let me turn that around. Who has not used drugs
and left behind anything worth doing? It's not that every drug
user has created great works of art. Many, if not most, have
tried, but few succeed. However, with very few exceptions, those
lucky, blessèd ones who have left behind &quot;elegant works of
art&quot; have used drugs. I'll give you one exception: George
Bernard Shaw. At least he claims not to have used drugs, but I
remain unconvinced. Of the known drug-using artists, the list is
long. Is there any doubt? The arts belong to drug users. Not just
jazz musicians. Consider all the writers, poets, painters who
have spoken of their drug use: Coleridge, Poe, etc. Where does
anyone get the temerity to challenge the contributions of drug
users to art! Ah, if only drug users went on strike, art would
cease and the souls of these Philistines who persecute us would
dry up like</font><font color="#0000FF"><font size="2"> the wings
of insects caught in our divine flame</font></font><font size="2">.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">But, scientists, too, have found inspiration in
drugs. Consider William Rowan Hamilton, without whom quantum
mechanics could not have arisen in quite the same way. Richard
Feynman admitted using drugs. The list is long and records the
names of some of the brightest stars. I will not &quot;out&quot;
living scientists despite what I know. Many of us would be
amazed.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Those who traffic in drugs are killers. </h3>

<p><font size="2">This is an absurd statement on the face of it.
Not, that no one who trafficked in drugs has been a killer; but,
generally, the killing has been incidental to the illegality. Who
is worse (a) a drug dealer who delivers on request a substance to
another man who wishes to ingest it or (b) a chief executive of a
chemical company who forces everyone in the neighborhood of his
plant to ingest poisonous chemical wastes whether they wish to or
not!</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">The flight from responsibility of drug users
endangers the free society. </h3>

<p><font size="2">This is a matter of calling the victim the
culprit. The heads of the multi-national corporations are the
true danger to society. And, if you will pardon me for speaking
the truth, capitalism (American style) is the real danger as it
reduces 90% or more of our population to third-world conditions
in its insatiable greed, as it starves the third world to death
and makes armed conflict inevitable. You, sir, are the danger to
a far-from-free society.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">In many areas drugs are so freely available
they might as well be legal. </h3>

<p><font size="2">No sir, the quality is horrible; the expense is
preposterous; and the danger from the police is terrifying. No,
no, and no. You and other evil, wicked, vicious authoritarians
are winning the war against drug users and dealers, but you will
never stop the flow of drugs. All you can do is increase the
misery of the wretched who fall into your clutches. This includes
that middle-class stock-broker who does heroin on the weekend out
on Long Island. He, too, knows that he hasn't much of a future to
live for. Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die. But, at
least, his white, middle-class crumbs from the table will buy him
decent drugs. The worst quality drugs go to the ghetto. Of
course. The white middle class enjoys a higher quality of
despair. How gratifying. &quot;But, it is a far, far better thing
I do than - what I normally do during the week.&quot;</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Our high prison population is composed of
brutes who have committed heinous acts and are more likely to
commit such acts on drugs. </h3>

<p><font size="2">The evidence shows otherwise. I'll go all the
way: the people in prison are the only ones left who can manifest
a little honor and refuse to bow to the ruling rich and their
loathsome toadies. The rich steal, but they don't rob. That's
because they are afraid of man but not afraid of God. The
criminal may not - I said <i>may</i> not - be afraid of God , but
he's not afraid of man either. The corporate bums are beneath the
respect of reptiles. I won't prove this, but you haven't proved
anything either. You had better get your philosophy together and
tell us what makes a good society and what makes a bad society. I
really don't believe you know. But, the next quote from Tyrrell
gives us a hint of his abiding faith in the essential equality of

<h1>A Review of Drug Legalization, For And Against </h1>

<hr>

<p>I was honored (?) with the task of reviewing the book
&quot;Drug Legalization, For and Against&quot;. For publishing
the review they let me have the book. So here it is,
&quot;published&quot; on the net. </p>

<p>[in paper: ISBN-0-8126-9169-5 in cloth: ISBN-0-8126-9168-7] </p>

<p>The book is published by Open Court Publishing Company,
(LaSalle IL, 61301 (c) 1992) edited by Rod L. Evans and Irwin M.
Berent with a forward by Linus Pauling and a redundant
introduction by Hugh Downs. The editors are appologetic for being
biased in favor of some form of legalization and given the
arguments they picked favoring the status quo of prohibition it's
easy to see why. I think they tried hard to find good arguments
for continuing prohibition but it really boils down to accepting
a paternalistic government versus a free society. Out of 11
articles favoring prohibition, only 2 were consistent: given
their basis of argument you could logically reach the same
conclusion. I just happen to disagree with their basis. </p>

<p>So there's no confusion, both the editors and reviewer agree,
legalization (of some form) is the way to go. </p>

<p>In general, the legalizers used facts and talked much about
marijuana and the prohibitionists used rhetoric and polls (nobody
believes the other side so don't listen to them) and talked much
about heroin and cocaine. Given the skew argument, maybe
legalizing hemp really is possible? All other drugs are just a
matter of changing a few polls. To this reader, the best
prohibitionist argument was &quot;we have helmet laws, therefore
we can control your mind too.&quot; This is true. We ought not
have helmet laws! </p>

<p>What follows are my notes of each contributing author. </p>

<p>Their efforts were culled from various journals and
proceedings from 1988 to 1992. Only one article has never been
published before. It was actually my favorite piece. </p>

<p>Linus Pauling opens the book with the concept of
*orthomolecular substances* as things which the human body has
adapted to over the past million years or so and *drugs* as
substances not normally present. He figures distilled alcohol is
only a few hundred years old so that falls in the category of
drugs but he says &quot;marijuana and cocaine, and perhaps also
peyote&quot; should be as available as beer. I hope he meant coca
leaf and not processed cocaine because that would make him a
hypocrite, calling distilled alcohol a drug but not processed
cocaine! </p>

<p>Hugh Downs asks the readers to think about legalization and
suggests a few questions to have in mind while reading the book.
The editors then spell out their rational for putting the book
together the way they did. The book is laid out in 11 chapters of
various types of arguments with the first chapter a list of
questions that Charles Rangle (chairman of the select Committee
on Narcotics Abuse and Control) asked his committee to consider
at the behest of Kurt Schmoke's request to investigate
legalization. They are really good questions and he obviously
ignored the answers to stay a prohibitionist. All in all the book
starts out interesting. Next up was a very abridged version of
Nadelmann's 1989 Science article arguing for legalization. I'd
read the original so I skipped this. </p>

<p>James Wilson (prof. of mang. and public policy at UCLA) mounts
a personal attack on Nadelmann and tries to use history of drugs
starting in 1970. Very unconvincing. </p>

<p>Then comes Milton Friedman's famous letters to Bill Bennett
and the reply. Bennett says &quot;I advocate a larger criminal
justice system to take drug users off the streets.&quot; And
&quot;drug use is a threat to the individual liberty and domestic
tranquillity guaranteed by the constitution.&quot; Friedman
replies with a quote from Justice Brandeis: </p>

<p>&quot;The greater dangers to liberty lurk in insidious
encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning, but without
understanding.&quot; </p>

<p>At this point I'm wondering if the prohibitionists have
anybody who can articulate their viewpoint at all with reason. </p>

<p>Fortunately Ed Tully and Marguerite Bennett of the FBI show up
with the most consistent argument for the prohibitionists. They
start out making good points about individual rights versus
social safety. They feel that laws which &quot;protect the
individual&quot; (seat belt and helmet laws) are good things.
Using this as a basis they argue well for prohibition. They also
use several specious arguments about the dangers of marijuana
which are blatantly false but this does not affect their
arguments. Proves to me that paternalistic society is a bad
thing. </p>

<p>Merrill Smith (U.S. Chief Probation Officer) gives lots of
quotes from professors and medical doctors. Lots more facts than
the FBI argument and an excellent review of history of how drugs
went from the medical domain to the criminal starting from the
1890's. </p>

<p>John Hill (Law prof. and Ph.D. philosophy) then comes along
with a really nice libertarian perspective. The book might be
worth getting for this article alone. Hill argues for the
principle of a &quot;zone of privacy&quot;. He defines
&quot;'privacy' in the jurisprudential sense is that which is
beyond the legitimate concern of the government and its
laws.&quot; A couple of quotes I really liked are:
&quot;Similarly, monarchists, Marxists, and fascists of various
brands reject the notion of a private realm of individual choice
as a chimera of modern Liberalism.&quot; And &quot;Defenders of a
zone of privacy, on the other hand, recognize the logical and
moral primacy of the individual over the state. The individual is
not, as it was for Aristotle, a part of the state. Rather, the
state is the creation of the individual and, as such, the servant
of individual ends.&quot; Right on dude! </p>

<p>Hill goes on to study supreme court rullings about privacy and
covers 4 specific areas. He then quotes Mill's definition of
'harm to others' and relates all this to drug use. He does not
venture a direct opinion towards legalization and tosses out bits
for debate such as &quot;prohibition might also be warranted in
the case of certain specified drugs that pose a threat to the
continued autonomy of the individual user.&quot; An ivory tower
argument but a great place to get definitions and a basis for
legalization. </p>

<p>Mark Moore (Harvard Prof. of Criminal Justice) starts off with
&quot;In this Article, I note that the 'drug problem' is
primarily a cocaine epidemic.&quot; Sets up 6 straw men
'alternatives' of legalization and then knocks them down. Very
unconvincing. He blames all of societies problems on drug use.
Actually it's kind of sad. </p>

<p>Todd Brenner (Lawyer, Notes Editor for Capital Law Review) is
very repetitive of the legalization side. Nadelmann covered the
facts and Hill covered the logic. I didn't finish reading it. It
seemed like 50 pages of the book could have been saved leaving
Moore and Brenner out. </p>

<p>I then skipped Wisotsky (Law prof. at Nova University) as just
another boring lawyer. [That's part of the reason I'm running for
office on the Libertarian ticket. I'm sick of lawyer's telling me
how to live my life.] </p>

<p>Kurt Schmoke gives a short, succinct and powerful message for
legalization. Bill Bennett (again!?) rantingly replies &quot;law
enforcement works&quot;. Is this bias of editors or is there
really no rational explanation of prohibition? </p>

<p>Dr. Gazzaniga (psychiatry prof. Dartmouth Med. school) is
published in interview format. This was interesting to read after
the previous boring rants and gave a useful counter to the
&quot;drugs create crime&quot; falicy. Compares alcohol, tobacco
to crack and cocaine addictions. </p>

<p>Gabriel Nahas (pharmacologist and known liar) claims alcohol
&quot;does not impair mental acuity&quot; but marijuana does
&quot;even in minute quantities&quot;. Seeming to admit he has no
facts he says &quot;Only when the vital grass-roots forces of
America feeling their existence threatened, become determined to
fight drugs will they be able to wage a war and win it.&quot; He
basically believes propaganda and lies will work forever. Made me
want to puke. </p>

<p>Thomas Szasz (psychiatrist prof. from SUNY) follows in typical
great style. He has a sharp wit but uses few real facts. He gives
a high level abstract argument with some of the best legalization
propaganda I've seen. He directly ties Hitler's argument of the
'dangerous jew' to WoD's 'dangerous drugs'. He says: &quot;The
perennial confrontation between authority and autonomy, the
permanent tension between behavior based on submission to
coercion and the free choice of one's own course in life - these
basic themes of human morality and psychology are now enacted on
a stage on which the principal props are drugs and laws against
drugs.&quot; Kind of made me wonder if the human race is worth
the effort I expend on it. </p>

<p>David Musto (psychiatry prof. Yale) gives an accurate
historical perspective. He argues public opinion polls be used to
determine what to do with drugs: &quot;My belief is that the
popular attitude which is growing so powerfully against drug use
in this country is in the long run more determinative than
profits or even foreign supply.&quot; He does think &quot;we must
not again revert to extreme punishments, silence or
exaggeration&quot; when discussing drug use. He suggests that the
war should plow ahead as usual because it is working. He ignores
his own arguments but it ranks up there with the FBI paper as the
best of the prohibitionists. </p>

<p>William Buckly (editor National Review) complains that
&quot;no politician can be elected who recommends the one thing
that hasn't been tried.&quot; They could have picked a better
piece. I think this could have been left out also. </p>

<p>Morton Kondracke (senior editor New Republic) claims that
&quot;drugs have been the rage in America only since about
1962&quot;. He makes the amazing assumption that because alcohol
kills 200,000 people per year that legalizing marijuana would do
the same thing and including all drugs he says &quot;the number
of deaths actually could go as high as 500,000 a year.&quot; He
concludes &quot;in the name of health, economics, and morality,
there seems no alternative but to keep drugs illegal.&quot; The
'liberals' are more dangerous than the 'conservatives'! </p>

<p>Ms. Taylor Branch (freelance writer) comes at it with a
literary attack. She compares Prohibition to today. She comments
on the connection between racism and drugs and why doctors did
not defend use of opium or cocaine. She argues for a &quot;Koop
model&quot; of legalization: no advertising, no sales to minors,
but legal to purchase with warnings that it's bad for you. She
ends with &quot;To fight the entire drug war by Everett Koop's
rules would require disciplined courage within individual
citizens and enormous trust between them. But so does the
practice of democracy itself.&quot; </p>

<p>The book ends with Arnold Trebach (law prof. American
University and head of Drug Policy Foundation) throwing a self
promoting rah-rah. He gives a few good points on how activists
should push for medical marijuana and heroin and asks that users
be left alone but dealers still be punished. Argues for political
reason on the part of legalizers and suggests taking things one
step at a time. </p>

<p>The lawyers were definitely boring. Too many words and not
enough said. If you've been in the WoD for awhile, this book does
you no good at all. But their market is the &quot;public&quot;
and for that it may be too thick. If the market is libertarians
it may sell ok. I just have the feeling that there must be more
to the prohibitionist argument. If there isn't then it should be
really easy to legalize hemp. The major argument is that the
government has the power to control individual behavior. This is
absurd. Government can not control its own behavior let alone
that of individuals. This is observed historical fact. I'll be
suprised if the book gets wide circulation because it is biased
in favor of legalization. The powers that be are biased against
it. </p>

<p>Nahas is right about one point: &quot;Only when the vital
grass-roots forces of America feeling their existance
threatened&quot; will they fight oppression. If this book really
represents the prohibitionists then they are planting the seeds
of their own destruction. And this book documents their demise. </p>

<p>BIBLIOGRAPHY ON MARIJUANA<br>
</p>

<p>submitted by Dr. Eric A. Voth, MD, of Drug Watch International
</p>

<p>5/27/96 </p>

<p>How this document got here: </p>

<p>I was in some private discussions with Dr. Voth, who is a
vehement opponent of the legalization of marijuana. In the course
of our discussion I pointed to the research which I already have
on this website and asked Dr. Voth to supply any research or
references which would support his point of view. It took a lot
of pestering, but finally Dr. Voth submitted the following
bibliography on marijuana. </p>

<p>What is most curious about this bibliography is that much of
it does not support Dr. Voth's point of view. It honestly makes
me wonder if he has read the books on his own list. I have
specifically asked him about a few of the books listed here, such
as the <u>Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs</u>,
but he has never given any indication that he has read them. If
Dr. Voth will respond with a list of the ones he claims to have
read, I will post that, too. </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> <img src="blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>Purpose</b> </p>

<p> The purpose of this manual is twofold: first, to analyze the
arguments employed by proponents of drug legalization or
decriminalization;1 and second, to provide arguments necessary to
defeat these positions. </p>

<p> <b>Structure</b> </p>

<p> This manual is divided into chapters, each chapter addressing
a different argument used by the &quot;legalizers.&quot; For
example, Chapter One addresses the argument that legalizing drugs
would reduce the addiction rate; Chapter Two addresses the impact
that legalizing drugs would have on the crime rate. Furthermore,
each chapter is divided into two parts. The first part, termed
the &quot;Discussion&quot; section, briefly states the
legalizers' arguments and then provides an in-depth analysis of
how to defeat them. </p>

<p> The second part of each chapter is termed the &quot;Summary
Sheet&quot; section. The Summary Sheet section is designed for
people who for whatever reason do not have time to read the
Discussion section - for example, those people who actually are
involved in a debate at that moment. The Summary Sheet section is
divided into two columns, the first titled &quot;If They
Say,&quot; and the second called &quot;Then You Say.&quot; The
Summary Sheet section basically iterates the factual highlights
of the Discussion section in a format that is easy to &quot;just
pick up and use.&quot; In both the Discussion and the Summary
Sheet sections, relevant facts will be footnoted or otherwise
cited. This is so that if anyone asks you where you got your
information, you will be able to tell them immediately. </p>

<p> Appendix One suggests a structured format for an actual
public debate. Following these rules will prevent the debate from
disintegrating into a shouting match and a forum for
&quot;speeches&quot; from the audience. </p>

<p> Finally, an extensive bibliography is provided for your
convenience should you choose to pursue additional reading. </p>

<p> 1 For purposes of this manual, &quot;legalization&quot; means
a policy whereby selling and using drugs is legal.
&quot;Decriminalization&quot; means a policy whereby penalties
for breaking the drug laws are lessened and/or the drug laws are
restricted in scope. See Ralph A. Weisheit and Katherine Johnson,
&quot;'Exploring the Dimensions of Support for Decriminalization
of Drugs,&quot; Journal of Drug Issues, Winter 1992. That is, if
heroin were legalized, it would be legal to sell or use it. If
heroin were decriminalized, it technically would be illegal to
use it, but (for instance) the penalty for its use would be a $10
fine. Another example of decriminalization would be allowing the
use of heroin as a common pain killer in hospitals. </p>

<h2><img src="blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Introductory Pointers </h2>

<p> <img src="blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> Before getting to the substance of the legalization debate
itself, here are three suggestions for use when debating the
legalizers. </p>

<p> <b>1.</b> <b>Right to expect benefits. </b>As with any
policy, you have a right to demand that the legalizers prove that
the benefits of their proposal outweigh its costs. </p>

<p> <b>2.</b> <b>Right to specificity. </b>As with any policy,
you have a right to demand that the legalizers provide a specific
proposal which to debate. One cannot talk about policy in the
abstract. For example, let's say that you were debating whether
the federal government should cut spending - you have to have
some idea of what is to be cut, how much is to be cut, when it is
going to be cut, etc. With regard to the legalization debate, you
should ask your opponent these questions <i>at the beginning of
the debate:</i> </p>

<ul>
    <li>What drugs are we talking about? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Are they advocating legalization or decriminalization? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Are there limitations on who can use these drugs - what
        about children, pregnant women, prison inmates, police,
        members of the military, people who drive buses or fly
        planes, etc.? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Are there limitations on the quantity or potency of drugs
        that the individual can use? Would an unlimited supply of
        drugs be made available to the habitual users or drug
        addicts? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Who will create, market, and sell the drugs? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>How much will the drugs cost? Will the drugs be taxed,
        and if so, at what rate? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Will drug addiction be able to be used as a defense in
        civil or criminal trials? </li>
</ul>

<p> Make sure that your opponent answers these questions early!
After all, it is only fair that you know what you are debating
before you begin the debate. </p>

<p> <b>3. Right to sources of information. </b>You have a right
to ask the legalizers the source of their data. By the same
token, they have the right to ask the same of you (and that's why
this manual is complete with footnotes). </p>

<p> Bearing these pointers in mind, we begin with an analysis of
legalization and addiction rates. <br>

<p>Drug Legalization: Myths and Misconceptions - US Dept. of
Justice</p>

<h2>Chapter One: Addiction Rates And Drug Legalization </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of drug legalization argue that legalizing drugs
would decrease addiction rates for two reasons. First, they
maintain, people use drugs <i>because </i>they are illegal - that
is, people get a thrill breaking a social taboo. Legalize drugs
and the incentive to take them will go away. Second, proponents
of legalization argue that if drugs were legalized, we could
spend the money that we presently spend on the criminal justice
system on treatment of addicts.2 </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Before addressing the particular merits of the legalization
debate, it is useful to describe just what is an addiction.
Addictions are either physical or psychological. Physical
addiction occurs when the body becomes dependent upon chemicals
or drugs not normally found in the human body and requires such
chemicals in order to sustain basic bodily functions. Take, for
instance, cocaine addiction. Cocaine alters the means by which
brain cells communicate with one another. Usually, nerve cells
(neurons) send signals to one another through chemical
neurotransmitters such as dopamine. Dopamine flows from one
neuron to the other, delivers its message, and returns to the
original neuron. Cocaine, however, blocks the dopamine from
returning to the first cell, and the first cell just keeps firing
away. This explains why cocaine produces such feelings of
pleasure; for lack of a better description, cocaine locks all of
the user's neurons into an &quot;On&quot; position. The problem
occurs when all of the cocaine has been metabolized by the body.
As Professor James Q. Wilson explains, &quot;[w]hen the
exaggerated high produced by cocaine-influenced dopamine finally
ends, the brain cells may (in ways that are still a matter of
dispute) suffer from an extreme lack of dopamine, thereby making
the individual unable to experience any pleasure at all.&quot;3
This is a very simplified model, of course, and different drugs
affect the body in different ways, but a simple fact remains -
physical addiction is biochemical in nature and is independent of
social, political, or psychological causes. </p>

<p>There is another type of addiction, however, that being
psychological addiction. Unlike physical addiction, which
basically is a medical condition, psychological addiction occurs
when the individual user feels or is of the opinion that drugs
are necessary for his or her life. This is not to suggest that
psychological addiction is easily dismissed; indeed it can have a
profound influence on how addicts live their lives. Such
especially is the case when addicts live in a culture that
continually reinforces the desirability or necessity of drug use.
</p>

<p>Let us examine addiction specific to two drugs: cocaine and
marijuana. Although rough, estimates suggest that there are
between 650,000 and 2.4 million cocaine addicts in the United
States.4 &quot;Cocaine is a much more addictive drug than
alcohol. If cocaine were legally available the number of cocaine
abusers would probably rise to...perhaps 20-25million.&quot;5
Mitchell Rosenthal, President of the Phoenix House
drug-rehabilitation program states that cheap available drugs
would increase addiction; only 10% of drinkers become hooked,
while an estimated 75% of regular drug (crack) users could become
addicts.6 Scientific studies agree, noting that when given
unlimited access to cocaine, laboratory animals will consume
increasingly greater amounts until they die.7 That cocaine is
harmful to one's health likely will come as a surprise to no one.
Dr. Frank H. Gawin, director of stimulant abuse, treatment and
research at Yale University concludes that cocaine causes
depression, paranoia, and &quot;violent psychotic
behavior.&quot;8 What is worse, there is presently no effective,
permanent treatment for cocaine addiction.9 </p>

<p>Almost everyone would agree that cocaine is a dangerous,
addictive drug, but many would be surprised to find that the same
is true of marijuana. Although it is very difficult to determine
the precise number of marijuana users and addicts in the United
States, one fact is clear: marijuana has become much more potent
over the last twenty years. Cannabis delta 9
tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as &quot;THC,&quot; is the
active ingredient in marijuana and other cannabis such as
hashish. The THC content in marijuana during the days of
Woodstock was something less than 1%. In 1974, the average THC
content of illicit marijuana was 0. 36% and by 1984 had increased
to 4.40%.10 In 1992 in Alaska, marijuana was discovered that<b> </b>had
a THC content of 29.86%.11 Now stop and think about that for a
minute. Today's marijuana may be between thirty to sixty times as
potent as were the joints of the 1960's. </p>

<p>This observation gives one pause when we realize that THC is
both dangerous and habit-forming. Marinol, a prescription drug
that is very occasionally used in the treatment of nausea
associated with chemotherapy, is chemically synthesized THC. Most
people are familiar with the information sheets that come with
prescription drugs - the pieces of paper that detail the
indications and usage of the drug in question, its potential
side-effects, its chemical composition, etc. The information
sheet that comes with Marinol states verbatim, &quot;MARINOL is
highly abusable and can produce both physical and psychological
dependence .... Patients receiving MARINOL should be closely
observed.&quot;12 The company that produces Marinol goes on to
explain that its THC may cause &quot;changes in mood ...
decrements in cognitive performance and memory, a decreased
ability to control drives and impulses [and] . . . a full-blown
picture of psychosis (psychotic organic brain syndrome) may occur
in patients receiving doses within the lower portion of the
therapeutic range.&quot;13 </p>

<p>Such warnings should not surprise the scientists who have for
many years maintained that the THC contained in marijuana is
dangerous. First, in the late 1960's Dr. Robert Heath, then
chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Tulane
Medical School, found that marijuana affects brain waves and
destroys brain cells.14 Second, a study conducted by Dr. Ethel
Sassenrath at the University of California at Davis between 1974
and 1978 found that THC increased the rate of fetal loss (in
utero, fetal death) in monkeys by over 300%, while at the same
time decreasing the birth weights in those babies born alive.15
Third, a study by Dr. Susan Dalterio, at the University of Texas
found that marijuana decreased testosterone and impaired sexual
development in male mice.16 Finally, a study by Dr. Albert Munson
found that injections of THC suppressed the immune systems of
mice and made them 96 times more susceptible to the herpes
virus.17 </p>

<p>Dr. Charles R. Schuster, former Director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse said, &quot;The fact that there are over
77,000 admissions a year to treatment programs for marijuana use
and that annually almost 8,000 persons require emergency hospital
care for marijuana use is sufficient evidence of the drugs
dangerousness&quot;18 </p>

<p>Clearly, drugs such as cocaine and marijuana are, both
addictive and dangerous. The legalizers likely would admit this,
but counter by saying that if we legalized them we would have
less of a problem. This is untrue. </p>

<p>Recall from above that legalizers claim that people use and
become addicted to drugs because of the excitement of breaking
the law - it is the fact that drugs are illegal that causes
people to try them. The data disagree. Robert E. Peterson, Former
Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania notes, &quot;70% of high
school students in New Jersey and about 60% of the students in
California said that fear of getting in trouble with the law
constituted a major reason <u>not</u> to use drugs.&quot;19 </p>

<p>The legalizers' argument that we should legalize drugs and
spend the money we now spend on criminal prosecution on treatment
and rehabilitation also fails. Both proponents and opponents of
legalization are in agreement that legalization almost certainly
would decrease the price of drugs as they became more available.
However, basic economic theory states that as the price of a
commodity declines, demand for the commodity will increase. But
whereas the reverse usually also is true (increase price and
demand decreases), it is not so with addictive substances. That
is, drop the price of a gram of cocaine by 50%, and you will see
an increase in use as demand for the product increases. Increase
the price of cocaine by 50%, and you will <i>not </i>see an equal
decrease in demand because addicts will pay the price to sustain
their addictions. In technical economic terms, the demand for
addictive drugs is elastic with respect to price declines, but
inelastic with respect to price increases. </p>

<p>Expert opinion supports this hypothesis. Dr. Herbert D. Kleber
of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, Columbia
University, suggests that legalization of cocaine would result in
a five- to six-fold increase in cocaine use.20 Dr. Robert DuPont,
former director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse agrees,
stating that legalization would increase the number of users of
cocaine and marijuana to between fifty and sixty million, and the
number of heroin users to around ten million.21 Dr. DuPont
concludes that when one takes into account the health effects of
cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, legalization could result in
between 100,000 and 500,000 drug induced deaths each year.22
Further, you cannot legalize cocaine and control the crack
epidemic, for users could easily turn the former into the latter.
</p>

<p>History also supports the fact that legalization would
increase addiction rates. When opium was legal in the United
States at the turn of the century, we had proportionately between
two and three times the number of addicts than we do presently.23
Furthermore, Dr. Richard Schwartz, Professor of Pediatrics at
Georgetown University School of Medicine, notes that Alaska and
Oregon, the states that traditionally have had the most lenient
drug laws, also have the highest marijuana addiction rates in the
United States double the national average.24 </p>

<p>Finally, foreign countries that have relaxed drug laws have
seen an increase in addiction rates [see Chapter Three]. </p>

<p>In short, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana are dangerous and
highly addictive substances. Scholarly opinion, historical
evidence, and common sense suggest that if these drugs are
legalized, then the rates of addiction will skyrocket, leading to
misery and death. </p>

<p>2 See Chapters Two and Four for additional discussion of
whether legalizing drugs would indeed allow us to shift resources
from criminal prosecution to treatment and rehabilitation. </p>

<p>Drug Legalization: Myths and Misconceptions</p>

<h2>Chapter Two: Crime and Drug Legalization </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Discussion</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization advance two theories as to how
legalization will decrease crime in the United States, and both
are dependent on the assumption that legalization will reduce the
cost of drugs to the user. First, because users will not have to
spend as much to support their drug habits, fewer will need to
commit crimes such as robbery and burglary to obtain drug money.
Second, because the cost of drugs will decrease, so will the drug
sellers' profits. Because drugs will no longer be a profitable
business, and because addicts will be able to obtain their drugs
from legal sources, the current black market suppliers of drugs -
gangs, foreign cartels, organized criminals, etc.-will fade away.
</p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Before addressing these theories, it is useful to distinguish
between three types of drug-related crime. As Professor James Q.
Wilson notes </p>

<p>[t]he illegality of drugs increases crime, partly because some
users turn to crime to pay for their habits, partly because some
users are stimulated by certain drugs (such as crack or PCP) to
act more violently or ruthlessly than they otherwise would, and
partly because criminal organizations seeking to control drug
supplies use force to manage their markets.25 </p>

<p>For ease of discussion, this author will refer to the crime
caused by people to pay for their habits as
&quot;purchase-related,&quot; the crime caused by people while
under the influence of drugs as &quot;drug-induced,&quot; and the
crime caused by organized criminal suppliers of drugs as
&quot;black market crime.&quot; Let us discuss each in turn. </p>

<p><b>A. Purchase-related crime</b> </p>

<p>As stated above, legalizers assume that as legalized drugs
become less expensive, addicts will no longer have to commit
crimes in order to fund their habits. One immediate difficulty
with this analysis is that drugs already are exceptionally
inexpensive. For example, a hit of crack costs about five dollars
on the streets of Seattle and about three dollars in other major
metropolitan areas.27 Granted, the pharmaceutical cost of cocaine
sufficient to make a hit of crack is roughly twenty-five cents.28
But to the extent that a legal crack supplier likely would have
to meet government regulations or would have to internalize the
costs of taxes placed upon the legalized drug, some analysts
question whether it is possible to reduce the current
street-price of drugs.29 </p>

<p>Nonetheless, let us assume that legal drug suppliers could
undersell the black market by offering cocaine for approximately
fifty cents a dose. What would happen? </p>

<p>As discussed at length in Chapter One, addiction rates would
skyrocket. This fact is almost indisputable, and even the
Libertarian supporters of drug legalization admit that &quot;low
prices would encourage use.&quot;30 History is very clear on this
point as well---once cocaine began being marketed in the high
potency/low cost form of crack, addiction rates did increase.31
And when addiction rates increase, so does purchase-related
crime. As Elliott Currie explains, &quot;[h]igher levels of drug
use <u>do</u> go hand in hand with increased crime, especially
property crime.&quot;32 </p>

<p>So in reality, legalizing drugs would not decrease
purchase-related crime, but would actually <i>increase </i>it.
Three reasons explain why this is so. First, if you decrease the
price of an addictive substance, addicts merely will buy more of
the<b> </b>less expensive product.33 Second, it is not as if
addicts steal money only to pay for drugs; likely, they steal
money to meet living expenses such as food, rent, etc. William
Bennett notes that &quot;[m]aking drugs legal would just be a way
of subsidizing [addicts] habit. They would continue to rob and
steal to pay for food, for clothes, for entertainment.&quot;34 Of
course, since there are more addicts, there would be more people
committing purchase-related crimes. Third, one must recall that
purchase-related crime is not directly related to the cost of the
drug, but instead is indirectly related: the prices of drugs
affect the addiction rate, which in turn affects the
purchase-related crime rate. This point perhaps is subtle, but
also is important. Addicts will pay almost any price for drugs.
Thus the question becomes not &quot;What is the price of
drugs,&quot; but instead &quot;How many addicts are there?&quot;
Because legalized drugs increase addiction rates,
purchase-related crime necessarily increases. </p>

<p><b>B. Drug-induced crime</b> </p>

<p>As with purchase-related crime, the price of drugs is not
directly relevant in determining the amount of drug-induced
crime, except to the extent that the price affects the number of
addicts. Undoubtedly, drug-induced crime is a significant
problem, One conservative estimate based upon the Bureau of
Justice Statistics study suggests that with regard to local jail
inmates, 15.4% of such inmates tested positive for illegal drugs
and an additional 12.1 % tested positive for a combination of
illegal drugs and alcohol.35 Another study conducted by the
National Institute of Justice in 1986 found that for twelve major
metropolitan areas, 70% of inmates tested positive for illegal
drugs.36 The N.I.J. study concluded that &quot;[these offenders
did not commit crimes simply to feed their habits. Drugs changed
their behavior, enabled and encouraged them to act violently and
irrationally.&quot;37 </p>

<p>Again, these results are unsurprising. Drugs such as crack
encourage hyperactive violence.38 If you legalize such drugs and
the addiction rate increases, you will have more people walking
around more often under its influence. It simply is untenable to
suggest that policies such as legalization that increase
addiction rates could do anything but increase the frequency of
drug-induced crime. </p>

<p><b>C. Black market crime</b> </p>

<p>As mentioned above, legalizers suggest that if you allow drugs
to be sold legally, it would drive out the black market, for the
latter only thrives when people cannot obtain goods through
normal, legal channels. Such analysis seems attractive at first,
but a closer look at the facts will prove that it is both
simplistic and incorrect. </p>

<p>So long as there are any restrictions as to what drugs were to
be legalized, who would be able to buy them, what quantities and
potencies were available, etc., a black market would fill the
need. For example, if the legalizers would limit the sale of
drugs to those people over twenty-one, then the black market
would target children. This argument is made by David T.
Courtwright, who finds potential black markets for &quot;those
under twenty-one, or for public-safety officers, or transport
workers, or military personnel, or pregnant women, or prisoners,
or probationers, or parolees, or psychotics. . . . &quot;39 In
order truly to defeat the black market, one not only would have
to allow anyone to buy drugs, but also would have to make all
forms of drugs available. William Rasberry explains that
&quot;[i]f marijuana and perhaps heroin are legalized, but not
crack cocaine and violence-inducing PCP, the effect on the crime
associated with drug trafficking would be minimal.&quot; Few, if
any, legalizers would be willing completely to legalize all drugs
for all people - but if they refuse to do so, they cannot
justifiably claim to have made a significant impact on black
market crime. </p>

<p>Another problem with the legalizers' argument is that many of
them advocate a policy whereby legalized drugs are taxed in order
to raise revenue for other social programs. But again, if you
legalize drugs and tax them, you will have a black market that
can sell the same drugs less expensively. The same is true if you
stamp a tariff on imported drugs, and history shows this to be
correct. Recall that until the early twentieth century, opiates
and other drugs were legal in the United States. Much of the
opium consumed by U.S. citizens was imported from China, and
&quot; enlightened lawmakers decided to place a tariff on the
drug as a means of raising revenue. For example, between 1866 and
1914, the duty on crude opium was 33%; on ready-to-smoke opium it
was 97%.41 Although these tariffs did produce income, they also
created a smuggler's paradise that organized crime syndicates
such as the Chinese tongs quickly filled. Criminals would smuggle
opium into the country, not pay the tariff, and make a higher
profit margin on their goods. Interestingly enough, at the peak
of the opium tariffs twice as much opium was smuggled into the
U.S. as went through legal channels.42 Thus, history proves that
if you place a tariff on imported drugs - be they legal or
illegal - black markets will continue to flourish unabated. </p>

<p>Let's return to the simple taxation of drugs produced within
the United States. Again, the equation is simple - tax equals
black market - and again, history proves it to be true. Take
tobacco for instance. Here is a legal commodity that potentially
can be taxed by both the federal government and any of the state
governments.43 Unsurprisingly, some states historically have had
higher cigarette taxes than others. In 1975, smokers in North
Carolina would pay thirty-six cents a pack whereas New Yorkers
had to pay fifty-four cents.44 Organized syndicates took
advantage of the situation, buying cigarettes in North Carolina
and selling them in New York for a profit-indeed at one point 50%
of all the cigarettes sold in New York City were bootlegged
products controlled by criminal organizations.45 Thus, proponents
of legalized drugs will never be able to stop the black market,
because the federal government, even if it wanted to, could not
stop state governments from taxing the drugs at different levels.
</p>

<p>Finally, with regard to the entire black market theories of
the legalizers, we have to remember the simple fact that
organized crime is composed of criminals. Query what the Cali or
the Medellin Cartel would do if they discovered that their
cocaine was being under priced by a legal manufacturer (let's say
a pharmaceutical company like Upjohn). What is the chance that
the Colombians would say &quot;Oh well, we just cannot compete in
the market. Let's close up shop and take real jobs.&quot;
Unlikely. Instead, currently entrenched crime syndicates would
use violence to ensure their place in the market.46 In the above
example, the Cali cartel might destroy Upjohn's laboratories. Or
it might murder everyone who sits on their Board of Directors. Or
it might take the less glamorous, but certainly more traditional,
strategy of telling addicts that if they don't buy their cocaine
from the cartel, they will be killed. In short, the belief that
if we legalize drugs then organized crime will run away with its
tail between its legs ignores grim reality. </p>

<p>In conclusion, drugs produce three types of crime:
purchase-related crime, drug-induced crime, and black market
crime. To the extent that legalizing drugs would make them
cheaper - a point on which all sides of the debate agree - it
would create many new addicts and the incidence of
purchase-related crime and drug-induced crime would increase.
Furthermore, if there were any regulations or taxes of <i>any
sort </i>placed upon the legalized drugs, U.S. history proves
that the black market crime would continue. Thus, legalizing
drugs not only does not decrease criminal behavior, it almost
certainly would spur its increase. </p>

<p>If there are any restrictions placed upon who may use legal

<p>U.S. history proves that if you attempt to levy tariffs on

smuggling. Such was the case in the early twentieth century when

avoid tariffs. [David T. Courtwright, &quot;Should We Legalize

<p>If you tax the legal drugs at all, a black market will result.

smuggle cigarettes from states with low tobacco taxes into those
with high tobacco taxes, thus making a profit [Courtwright,

<p>Organized crime would use violence against legal suppliers in
order to ensure its market share. Criminals would not play by the

<h2>Chapter Three: The Experience of Foreign Countries and Drug
Legalization </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>Discussion</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization suggest that the experiences of
countries such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland
prove the efficacy of legalizing or decriminalizing various types
of illegal drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. They
maintain that because such drugs are legal, these countries have
fewer addicts and less drug-related crime. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>The statements of the legalizers here are empirically untrue.
As we discuss each country in turn, it will be shown that
legalization did not work in any of them. </p>

<p><b>A. Great Britain</b> </p>

<p>With the report of a government commission known as the Brain
Committee of 1964, England instituted a policy whereby doctors
could prescribe heroin so long as they followed certain treatment
criteria.47 Previously in England, doctors could prescribe heroin
much like any other opiate (such as morphine). This allowed a few
unscrupulous doctors to sell ungodly amounts of heroin to members
of the black market.48 Consequently, it was believed that if
heroin were offered at medical clinics according to stringent
rules and regulations, addicts would come to these clinics to
seek treatment and eventually would overcome their habit. </p>

<p>As of 1983, however, England began to phase out these programs
of clinically supplied heroin in favor of methadone treatment.49
Why? First, according to the reputable British physician journal <u>Lancet</u>,
the number of addicts increased 100% between 1970 and 1980.50 A
disproportionate number of these new addicts were between the
ages of sixteen and seventeen.51 Second, only twenty percent of
all of the addicts in England belonged to the clinical
programs.52 At first blush, this fact seems strange - why would
addicts choose not to participate in a program wherein they get
free methadone? The answer probably lies in the fact that
methadone does not produce the high that heroin does. Also,
addicts probably did not care for the mandatory treatment and
rehabilitation facets of the clinical programs. Whatever the
reason, by 1985 England had 80,000 heroin addicts, the vast
majority of whom wen not in treatment.53 </p>

<p>A third reason why England began to abolish its clinical
heroin program was the fact that not only were there few people,
in them, but the programs themselves did not work. According to
the <u>British Medical Journal</u>, more addicts left the program
because of criminal convictions than because of treatment.54
Fourth, even with the clinical programs, heroin addicts had a
death rate twenty-six times the average population. Finally, even
when the programs were in operation, Scotland Yard had to
increase its narcotics division 100% in order to cope with the
increased crime rate.56 </p>

<p>To summarize, the British experience with decriminalized
heroin in the clinical context was a dismal failure. When experts
from British Columbia were debating whether to create a similar
program, they made the following conclusions that are so
important as to deserve to be quoted at length: </p>

<p>While some success is claimed in terms of reducing the
incidence of young users, the following findings have also been
noted: </p>

<p>1) The British approach has failed to attract a majority of
addicts; </p>

<p>2) Many registered addicts continue to turn to illicit sources
of </p>

<p>drugs; </p>

<p>3) Many registered addicts do not decrease their dosage over
time; </p>

<p>4) Many registered addicts continue to be involved in criminal
activity; </p>

<p>5) Many registered addicts are chronically unemployed or do
not earn enough to look after themselves; </p>

<p>6) The death rate of registered addicts is much higher than
that of the general population and may be higher than that of
North American addicts; </p>

<p>7) Since 1960, there has been a dramatic increase in the
English addict population; </p>

<p>8) The black market for heroin continues to thrive; </p>

<p>9) Law enforcement appears to remain a necessary, costly and
complex control measure. </p>

<p>In view of the above, it is felt that the application of the
British approach to British Columbia would present serious
dangers.57 </p>

<p><b>B. The Netherlands</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization almost certainly would cite
Amsterdam as the drug Mecca of the Western world. Anyone may go
into the restaurants in this city and order marijuana and hashish
from a menu; further, heroin and cocaine have been decriminalized
for all practical purposes. The police simply leave the users
alone. Consequently, health officials estimate that Amsterdam has
7,000 addicts, 20% of whom are foreigners.58 These addicts are
responsible for 80% of all property crime in the city, thus
necessitating that Amsterdam maintain a police presence far
greater than those of cities of comparable size in the United
States.59 </p>

<p>The Dutch have not raised one dollar in tax revenue from drug
sales, and drug violators account for 50 percent of the Dutch
prison population, a higher proportion than in the United
States.60 The Netherlands is the most crime-prone nation in
Europe and most drug addicts live on state welfare payments and
by committing crimes.61 Nationwide, the number of reported crimes
increased to 1.3 million in 1992 from. 812,000 in 1981.62 Faced
with public disgust at home over soaring drug related crime and
pressure from other European Community countries to strengthen
drug laws, Dutch authorities are implementing an aggressive
program to reduce drug-linked crimes and disturbances and show
new teeth in combatting illegal drug sales.63 Eberhard van der
Laan, leader Of the Social Democrats in the Amsterdam City
Council says, &quot;People are absolutely fed up with all the
troubles caused by drug addicts - car windows broken, noise,
whole streets almost given up to the drug problem.&quot;64
Legalization advocates claim that marijuana use in Netherlands
has not increased since the laws were liberalized, but the number
of Amsterdam drug cafes rose from 30 to over 300 in one decade.
They also fail to note that daily marijuana use by U.S. youth has
declined by 75 percent.65 </p>

<p><b>C. Switzerland</b> </p>

<p>Much like Amsterdam, Switzerland until recently followed a
policy of decriminalization. Indeed, a city park in the town of
Zurich for many years was allowed to be a haven for drug users -
police simply would ignore the problem by claiming that it was
better to have all the addicts in one place rather than having
them roam throughout the entire city.66 Unsurprisingly, in
February of 1992 Switzerland ended this experiment with
decriminalization after experiencing an unacceptable increase in
use, violence, crime and health costs and consequences.67
Specifically, the number of addicts residing at the park (called
Platzspitz) jumped from a few hundred in 1987 to over 20,000, by
early 1992.68 Approximately 20% of these addicts were foreigners
who came to Zurich to take advantage of the city's lax drug
laws.69 In deciding to close the park, city officials cited the
increased incidence of crime and prostitution--as Andres Oehler,
a municipal spokesperson stated, &quot;it was felt that the
situation had got out of control in every sense.&quot;70 </p>

<p><b>D. Spain</b> </p>

<p>Since 1983 in Spain, it has been legal to use, but not sell,
cocaine and heroin. Recently, however, </p>

<p>Spanish officials have begun a crack-down on drug pushers due
to a dramatic increase in the addiction rate.71 Unsurprisingly,
Spain and Italy, which also legalized use of cocaine and heroin,
have the highest rates of both drug use and overdose of all
European countries.72 </p>

<p><b>E. China</b> </p>

<p>Lest we forget the lessons of history, consider that in the
late 1800's, opium was legal in China. By 1900, ninety million
Chinese were addicted to the drug, and it took fifty years of
repressive police measures and rehabilitation to correct the
problem.73 Today, opium and other addictive drugs are illegal.74 </p>

<p><b>F. Japan</b> </p>

<p>In the 1950's, Japan was faced with an epidemic of amphetamine
use that created half a million addicts. Through socialization
and policies aimed at both reducing supply and <u>demand</u>, the
number of addicts was decreased to a few thousand within four
years.75 A heroin epidemic involving thousands of addicts was
dealt with successfully in the 1960's using the same measures. 76
</p>

<p><b>G. Other countries</b> </p>

<p>Throughout recent history, numerous other countries have
attempted legalizing or decriminalizing drugs, all meeting with
the same harmful results. In Egypt in the 1920's, an unrestricted
supply of cocaine and heroin created an epidemic that eventually
resulted in the strict prosecution of all addicts.77 In Thailand
and Iran, countries that traditionally have had cheap and
unrestricted sources of narcotics, the addiction rates have been
and continue to be high.78 Finally, the Republic of Singapore had
to resort to strict law enforcement and mandatory rehabilitation
in order to overcome a heroin epidemic.79 </p>

<p>Given the experiences of countries such as Great Britain,
Switzerland, The Netherlands, China, Japan, Spain, Egypt, Iran,
and Thailand, it is little wonder why countries that
traditionally have had lenient drug laws are all moving in the
direction of illegalization. Undoubtedly, the danger that drug
legalization presents was foremost on the minds of the numerous
countries - the United States included - that signed the Single
Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on
Psychotropic Substances of 1971. And such danger also is why the
International Narcotics Control Board for the United Nations
concluded in 1992 that &quot;legalization advocates have not yet
presented a sufficiently comprehensive, coherent or viable
alternative to the present system of international drug abuse
control.&quot;80 </p>

<p>Myths and Misconceptions of Drug Legalization: US Dept. of
Justice</p>

<h2>Chapter Four: The Economics of Drug Legalization </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>Discussion</b> </p>

<p><b>1. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization suggest that their policy will save
society money for several reasons. First, we will not have to pay
police to enforce the present criminal-justice approach to drug
usage. Second, we will be able to tax legal drugs, thereby
raising revenue. </p>

<p>II. <b>Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>It should be stated initially that most people misconceive the
amount of resources expended under the status quo for drug
control. The FY 1994 federal budget allocates $7.51 billion for
drug control (supply reduction) which includes criminal justice,
interdiction, international programs and intelligence.81 State
and local governments spend even more, $12.6 billion a year.82
Granted, this is a lot of money, but we should put these numbers
in perspective. Americans spend about four billion dollars each
summer for air conditioning.83 The citizens of Washington State
spend $1.4 billion each year on legal gambling alone.84 The
national debt numbers in the trillions of dollars. One Stealth
Bomber runs half a billion dollars. Indeed, only 1.4% of total
government spending goes for law enforcement of all types, and an
additional 1.0% for prosecution and prisons.85 Out of this small
percentage, 12% of spending for law enforcement was allocated to
drug control activities, and about 25% of correctional (prison)
spending was drug related.86 Only 1.5% of total state and local
government spending is attributed to drug control activities.87
Thus, when taken in context, it is apparent that the costs of
criminalized drugs nowhere approaches the financial obligations
of government programs such as national defense, Social Security,
or Medicare. </p>

<p>More important, if we legalized drugs on the assumption that
by taxing them we could raise large amounts of revenue, we would
be sadly mistaken. First, as discussed in Chapter Two, any such
taxation scheme would perpetuate a criminal black market.
Consequently, we would still have to spend money funding police,
courts and the like to fight this problem. Second, if alcohol is
any indication, we simply would not make that much money by
taxing drugs. The total revenue collected from alcohol taxes at
the federal, state, and local levels amounts to about $13.1
billion a year,&quot; a paltry sum compared to the social costs
associated with alcohol consumption - something in the
neighborhood of $100 billion.&quot; Third, how would we structure
a tax scheme for drugs? If we wanted to correlate higher taxes
with higher risk behavior, logically we would tax the fifth joint
more than the first (inasmuch as the fifth joint probably is more
damaging to one's health). And wouldn't it cost money to create
the governmental bureaucracy that would handle this taxation
policy? </p>

<p>Thus, we do not spend that much on the drug war in comparison
to other governmental programs, and taxation of legalized drugs
would not result in that much revenue. But by far the most
compelling economic argument against the legalization of drugs is
the social costs associated with such a policy. </p>

<p>First, treating drug addicts is enormously expensive. Take
crack babies as an example. In 1988, it cost $2.5 billion for the
intensive care needed to keep the babies alive after birth.90 But
that was just the beginning of the expenses. It is estimated that
it will cost $15 billion to prepare these children for
kindergarten,91 and will then cost between $6 billion and $12
billion for every year of special learning programs.92 Even
assuming the low-ball figure, the social costs of educating all
of the crack babies born in 1988 -<i> not all crack babies, mind
you, just those born that year</i> - will run approximately $90
billion by the time they graduate from high school. Now to the
extent that legalization will increase the drug addiction rates
enormously [see Chapter One], legalization seems like a very
expensive policy indeed. And who will foot the bill? Either
common citizens will through taxes for government aid programs,
or through increased insurance premiums.93 </p>

<p>But treatment costs are just the first way in which drug
addiction drains society. Already, drug addicts cost the country
roughly $33 billion dollars a year in lost productivity and
job-related accidents, according to a study conducted in 1987 by
the Research Triangle Institute of Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina.94 If legalized, addiction rates would increase and the
cost would rise to between $140 billion and $210 billion a
year.95 And who will pay for lost productivity and job-related
accidents? Consumers will, of course, in the final costs of the
produced goods. </p>

<p>Finally we must consider human lives in the economic calculus.
As drug abuse causes more job related accidents, more people will
be hurt or killed. Take, for example, the Conrail/Amtrak disaster
of January 4, 1987. Because an engineer and a brakeman were high
on marijuana, their train collided with another, killing sixteen
people and injuring 175.96 </p>

<p>So go back to the beginning. We spend approximately $20
billion a year on drug control activities. If drugs were
legalized, we would see an increase in addiction rates.
Consequently we would have more crack babies (the kind that
already will cost the system $90 billion), decreased productivity
(at a cost of between $140 billion and $210 billion), more
job-related accidents, and more dead people. And given the
potential black market effect, it is unlikely that we could raise
even several billion dollars in tax revenue. From a purely
economic standpoint, legalization is not cost effective. </p>

<h2>Chapter Five: The Lessons of Prohibition and Drug
Legalization </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization suggest that the United States
experience with alcohol prohibition in the 1920's provides ample
proof of the problems that result when the government attempts to
make a popular substance illegal. Legalizers point to ostensible
increases in organized crime such as that associated with Al
Capone in order to make their point. Basically, they say, it is
better to legalize, tax and regulate than simply to declare drugs
illegal. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>The legalizers' arguments here are deeply flawed and merit two
primary responses: first, the circumstances surrounding
Prohibition are so different than those of today's world that it
practically is impossible to use its history as a means of
analyzing present-day policy; second, Prohibition was in fact
successful and did not create the negative consequences that the
legalizers say it did. </p>

<p>But to the first point. David Teasley, an analyst with the
Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress,
undertook an in-depth analysis in 1992 entitled, &quot;Drug
legalization and the 'lessons' of Prohibition.&quot; Teasley
ultimately concluded that </p>

<p>[A] comprehensive analogy between Prohibition and the modern
drug problem is problematic in at least two major ways. First,
between the two eras there are significant differences that tend
to undermine the prolegalization analogy. Second, many arguments
of the prolegalizers are weakened by their reliance upon a widely
held set of popular beliefs about Prohibition rather than upon
recent historical evidence. Such attempts to create this analogy
based upon these popular beliefs about Prohibition serve only to
confuse the debate over legalization of illicit drugs.97 </p>

<p>Let us examine the differences that Teasley (and others) cite
between the era of Prohibition and the era in which we now live. </p>

<p>First, during prohibition the government sought to restrict
the consumption of alcohol although it lacked the moral consensus
of the nation. That is, even during Prohibition, most people were
accepting of alcohol.98 Such is not the case today, for the vast
majority of citizens do feel that illicit drugs should remain
illegal [see Chapter Eleven]. Thus, Prohibition went against the
national consensus whereas illegalization of drugs does not. </p>

<p>Second, the laws of Prohibition themselves were different than
those dealing with illicit drugs today. During Prohibition, it
was not illegal to drink alcohol, it was only illegal to sell it.
Today, however, it is both illegal to sell and to use illicit
drugs. Consequently, today's laws can target the users while
those of the Prohibition era could not.99 </p>

<p>Third, during the Prohibition era several states did not
support the federal laws. This fact created tension between the
state and federal governments and hampered effective prosecution
of alcohol distributors. Today, 48 states have signed the Uniform
Controlled Substances Act, and all are in effective agreement
with the federal government in matters of drug policy - a
state/federal consensus exists that was not present during
Prohibition.100 </p>

<p>Fourth, criminal penalties are much more severe today than in
the 1920's. For example, the first-offense bootlegger faced a
maximum fine of $ 1,000 or six months in prison. Today, a
first-offense trafficker of cocaine or heroin (of less than 100
grams) faces fines up to $1 million and imprisonment for up to 20
years.101 </p>

<p>Fifth, during Prohibition the United States was a
&quot;dry&quot; nation within a &quot;wet&quot; international
community. Just as the Prohibition policies were counter to the
moral consensus within the U.S., they were also at odds with that
of the international community (which explains why so much
alcohol was imported from Canada). But as discussed in Chapter
Three, the international community is resolute when it comes to
drug policy; in December of 1988 over 80 countries signed the
Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances.102 Sixth and finally, the administrative
structure of the government agencies designed to carry out the
Prohibition laws was narrow, unstable, and filled with political
appointees. Today's national drug strategy involves over a dozen
federal agencies coordinated by the Office of National Drug
Control Policy. In short, the governmental bodies that prosecute
today's drug violators are much larger, have much better
resources, and are much more professional than their Prohibition
counterparts.103 </p>

<p>Thus, it is factually incorrect for the legalizers to
analogize our history with Prohibition to today's drug policies.
They simply do not have that much in common. But should the
legalizers choose to make such an analogy, they also should be
made aware of the fact that Prohibition was on balance a
successful program. </p>

<p>First, use of alcohol decreased significantly during
Prohibition.104 This decrease in turn lead to a marked decrease
in the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver.105 Also,
alcohol-related arrests decreased 50%. 106 Finally, the suicide
rate also decreased by 50%.107 </p>

<p>A second reason why Prohibition was a successful program is
due to the fact that it did not -- contrary to popular myth --
cause an increase in the crime rate. It is true that there was an
increase in the homicide rate during Prohibition, but this is not
the same as an increase in the overall crime rate. Furthermore,
the increase in homicide occurred predominantly in the
African-American community, and African-Americans at that time
were not the people responsible for alcohol trafficking.108 The
drama of Elliot Ness and Al Capone largely was just that, drama
sensationalized by the media of the time. </p>

<p>In short, it is doubtful that one legitimately may analogize
Prohibition with our current efforts to control drugs. There are
too many differences in the laws, the political establishment,
the moral consensus, and the international community to make such
analogizing worthwhile. Nonetheless, the fact remains that
Prohibition accomplished many of its goals, improved the health
of the entire nation, and did not cause a significant increase in
the crime rate. Mark Kleinman, who has proposed legalizing
marijuana109 notes, the U.S. experience with Prohibition is the
best evidence to support the continued illegalization of illicit
drugs.110 </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>Whereas there was not a moral consensus for Prohibition U.S.
citizens overwhelmingly are in favor of the the continued
illegalization of illicit drugs. [Robert E. Peterson, &quot;Stop
Legalization of Illegal Drugs;&quot; Drug Awareness Information
Newsletter, July 1988]. </p>

<p>During Prohibition, only the sale, and not the use, of alcohol
was illegal. Today, both sale and use of illicit drugs are
illegal. Consequently, present drug policies can target users
whereas Prohibition laws could not. [David L. Teasley, &quot;Drug
legalization and the 'lessons' of Prohibition,&quot; Contemporary
Drug Problems, Spring 1992]. </p>

<p>During Prohibition, there was much tension between federal and
state alcohol policy. Today, 48 states have signed the Uniform
Controlled Substances Act, and the federal and state governments
work in concert. [David Teasley, citation above]. </p>

<p>During Prohibition, criminal sanctions were not extreme - a
first-time bootlegger could receive a $1,000 fine or six months
in prison. Today, fines for first-time cocaine or heroin
trafficking are up to $1 million and prison sentences go as high
as 20 years. [David Teasley, citation above). </p>

<p>During Prohibition, the U.S. was a &quot;dry&quot; country in
a &quot;wet&quot; international community. Today, almost all
countries are in agreement that drugs should be illegal, as
witnessed by the fact that 80 countries signed the 1988
Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances. [David Teasley, citation above]. </p>

<p>The political administration responsible for enforcing
Prohibition was small, underfunded, and unprofessional. In
contrast, the current drug control program is run by over a dozen
agencies coordinated by the Office of National Drug Control
Policy. [David Teasley, citation above]. </p>

<p>During Prohibition, incidence of cirrhosis of the liver
decreased by 35%. [Charles Krauthammer, &quot;Legalize? No,

<p>During Prohibition, the suicide rate decreased 50%. [Robert

<p>During Prohibition, the incidence of alcohol-related arrests
also declined by 50% [Robert L. DuPont, &quot;The Case Against

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the crime rate did not markedly
increase during prohibition. What did increase was the homicide
rate (not the same as the overall crime rate) among
African-Americans. And African-Americans had little to do with
alcohol trafficking. [David Teasley, citation above]. </p>

<p>Mark Kleiman admits that the U.S. experience with Prohibition
is one of the strongest arguments in favor of the continued

<h2>Chapter Six: The Role of Alcohol and Tobacco in the Drug
Legalization Debate </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p>I. <b>Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of drug legalization advance the argument that to
the extent alcohol and tobacco may be freely consumed, it is
hypocritical to make other drugs such as marijuana and cocaine
illegal. They cite the individual and social harm caused by both
tobacco and alcohol to support their argument. </p>

<p><b>II. Our</b> <b>Argument</b> </p>

<p>Two responses immediately come to mind when addressing the
legalizers' argument. First, simply because we have as a society
have chosen to legalize some dangerous substances does not lead
to the conclusion that we should legalize all dangerous
substances. Second, the legalizers' argument is logically flawed:
When they compare the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco to
that caused by drugs such as cocaine and marijuana they are
comparing apples and oranges (or more specifically, legal to
illegal drugs). Alcohol and tobacco are legal, and, according to
our analysis in Chapter One [Addiction Rates], are used much more
frequently than illegal drugs. Because their use is greater, the
amount of damage they cause will also be greater. But this is not
to say that one &quot;dose&quot; of alcohol is inherently more
dangerous than one &quot;dose&quot; of cocaine. As James Q.
Wilson explains, predictions about the harms of cocaine that
assume its illegality tells us little about what damage cocaine
would do if it were legal.111 Thus, the proper analysis is not to
compare damage caused by cocaine to that caused by alcohol under
the present system, but instead is to compare the harm likely
caused by <i>legalized </i>cocaine to that caused by alcohol. </p>

<p>But let us look more closely at the legalizers' position
itself. </p>

<p><b>1. Tobacco.</b> Certainly tobacco kills people.
Nonetheless, it is disingenuous to say that as such it is a more
dangerous substance than either cocaine or marijuana. For while
it may harm one's health, tobacco does not affect one's
intellectual processing or decision-making ability. As Professor
Wilson explains: </p>

<p>Tobacco shortens one's life, cocaine debases it.<b> </b>Nicotine
alters one's habits, cocaine alters one's soul. The heavy use of
crack, unlike the heavy use of tobacco, corrodes those natural
sentiments of sympathy and duty that constitute our human nature
and make possible our social life.&quot;' </p>

<p>Think of it this way: Research fairly convincingly has
demonstrated that cholesterol is bad for people, and in fact may
be responsible for a large amount of heart disease in the United
States. In essence, cholesterol kills. But to take this premise
and then argue that because we allow people to eat red meat we
should also allow them to smoke crack is both unsophisticated and
unpersuasive reasoning. Similarly, to argue that because we do
not allow people to smoke crack we should not allow them to eat
red meat also displays a rather monumental lack of common sense.
And although cholesterol may kill you, it does not lead to the
types of bizarre, destructive behavior that is associated with
most illegal drugs. </p>

<p>2. <b>Alcohol. </b>Alcohol is somewhat harder to justify, for
not only can it kill people but it does in fact alter one's
behavior and may encourage antisocial and destructive activity.
But again, this admission does not me-an that one must view
alcohol and cocaine as equivalent. First, a far greater
percentage of people who use cocaine become addicted to the
substance than do people who use alcohol. Recall that in Chapter
One, we discovered that the addiction rate for cocaine may be as
high as 75%.113 Conversely, the addiction rate for alcohol is
about 10%.114 One<b> </b>is thus far more likely to become
addicted to cocaine than to alcohol. Second, the relapse rate
(the percentage of people who quit the drug who later begin to
take it again), is much higher for cocaine.115 </p>

<p>In short, do not let proponents of legalization argue that
just because tobacco and alcohol are legal, so too should be
cocaine and marijuana. First, just because we sanction some
dangerous substances does not mean that we should allow all of
them. Second, it is misleading to compare the damage caused by
legal drugs with that caused by illegal drugs -- instead we
should compare the risks of alcohol and tobacco with those of <i>legalized
</i>cocaine and marijuana. Likely we would find that the latter
are much more dangerous than the former. </p>

<p>Third, tobacco does not alter one's behavior and encourage
violent behavior as do many illegal drugs. Fourth, alcohol, while
admittedly dangerous, is much less addictive than presently
illegal drugs and also is easier to quit once addicted. Do not
compound problems simply because they are difficult to solve-keep
illegal drugs illegal and at the same time try to discourage
alcohol and tobacco use. </p>

<p>One cannot properly compare the harm associated with tobacco

drugs. And as discussed in Chapter One, legalizing a drug makes
it more dangerous. (See last paragraph, page 7). </p>

<p>Although tobacco harms one's health, it does not alter one's
mental processes, nor does it create bizarre, violent behavior.
[James Q. Wilson, &quot;Against the Legalization of Drugs,&quot;

cocaine: Studies suggest that alcohol has an addiction rate of
10%, whereas cocaine has an addiction rate as high as 75%.
[George Church. &quot;Thinking<b> </b>the Unthinkable,&quot;'

<p>Do not legalize drugs because alcohol and tobacco are harmful:
keep illegal drugs illegal and try to decrease use of the others.

<p>Myths and Misconceptions about Drug Legalization: US Dept. of
Justice</p>

<h2>Chapter Seven: Medical Uses of Presently Illegal Drugs </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization suggest that even if drugs such as
cocaine, marijuana, and heroin are not fully legalized, they
should be made more available as forms of medical treatment. For
example, legalizers suggest that heroin should be used much in
the same way as is morphine presently and that marijuana should
be used in treating glaucoma and the side-effects of
chemotherapy. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>In order to fully analyze the debate surrounding the medical
uses of heroin and marijuana, each drug should be discussed in
turn. </p>

<p><b>1. Heroin</b> </p>

<p>Heroin is an opiate, as are drugs such as morphine. Legalizers
suggest that because morphine does not always succeed in
relieving the pain of, for example, cancer patients, the only
logical step is to try heroin. This is factually incorrect. </p>

<p>In order to understand why this argument is flawed, one must
know how heroin and morphine differ from one another. As Drs.
Robert McCarthy and Michael Montagne explain, &quot;Kaiko, et al.
found that although heroin is more potent - and achieves peak
pain control and mood elevation effects faster, both pain control
and mood elevation are more prolonged with morphine. &quot;116
That is, heroin gives you a quicker &quot;high,&quot; but
morphine provides longer-lasting effects. Furthermore, we have
many other opioids available under present pharmaceutical laws.
As Professor Arthur G. Lipman explains, </p>

<p>[s]ome advocates of heroin legalization argue that it should
be available as an alternative opioid because some patients
respond better to one opioid than another. That is true. However,
we already have a variety of opioids commercially available in
this country. If a patient does not respond to morphine as
expected, it would be more logical to use a chemically different
opioid (e.g., hydromorphone, methadone) than a morphine product
[such as heroin]. Therefore, the argument for heroin is not
logical. 117 </p>

<p>Not only is Professor Lipman's argument medically sound, but
it makes common sense. Heroin and morphine have similar chemical
structures. If morphine does not work for a given patient, it
makes more sense to try an opioid with a different chemical
construct than to give them a drug very similar to the one that
is not working. </p>

<p>These two facts----that heroin does not produce as constant
and prolonged a treatment as does morphine, and that many other
opioids presently exist that can do the job better than heroin in
the event that morphine does not work - help to explain why the
vast majority of medical society members do not favor the use of
heroin as a form of therapeutic treatment. The British doctors
who initially suggested the viability of therapeutic heroin
treatment long ago reversed their position.118 And although
Maurice Bectel, President of the American Pharmaceutical
Association, admits that problems do exist in the treatment of
cancer pain, these problems stem largely from the fact that
&quot;physicians fail to prescribe proper dosages of existing
medications, not because of the lack of availability of
heroin.&quot;119 Indeed, as Professor Lipman correctly notes,
&quot;[i]f the energy devoted to legalizing heroin were
redirected toward better use of available opioids, patients <u>would</u>
benefit.120 </p>

<p>But not only is allowing the therapeutic use of heroin
unnecessary, it also could create other problems. For example,
increased medical use of heroin increases the risk of
&quot;diversion&quot;-- that the patients would sell their heroin
on the black market.121 Also, if pharmacies routinely stocked a
supply of heroin, it would increase the risk of burglaries. This
fact gives one special concern when one notes that fully 50% of
burglaries against pharmacies are committed with the intention of
stealing controlled substances.122 </p>

<p>In short, Lipman concludes that &quot;[m]isinformation about
heroin has clouded the issue, but there is </p>

<p>valid, published scientific evidence that unequivocally
refutes the argument that heroin should be legalized.&quot;123 </p>

<p><b>2. Marijuana</b> </p>

<p><b>a. Treatment for glaucoma</b> </p>

<p>Glaucoma is a disease in which the fluid pressure within the
eyeball (known as the intraocular pressure) increases and thereby
damages the optic nerve, potentially causing blindness.
Legalizers advance the claim that marijuana can decrease the
intraocular pressure and thereby prevent blindness. Let's look at
this claim. </p>

<p>First, the studies that the legalizers cite for support of
their propositions assume the use of THC itself rather than
marijuana.125 Thus while one may claim that THC decreases
intraocular pressure, it is not technically correct to claim that
marijuana does as well. </p>

<p>Second, even if marijuana does decrease intraocular pressure,
it does so only at high dosages - in order to get the benefits,
you have to stay stoned all day. Doctor Keith Green suggests that
in order to decrease intraocular pressure, one would have to
smoke the equivalent of six joints a day.126 Michael Van Buskirk,
Director of Glaucoma Services and Chairman of the Department of
Ophthalmology at Devers Eye Institute agrees, stating that
&quot;[a]lcohol also produces a profound reduction in . . .
intraocular pressure. 'Me recommendation to use marijuana is
exactly analogous to the recommendation to ingest alcohol and
maintain a state of drunkenness to treat glaucoma.&quot;127 </p>

<p>Third, even if marijuana successfully combats one symptom of
glaucoma - intraocular pressure - it does so at the expense of
exacerbating another symptom. For while marijuana may decrease
intraocular pressure, it also decreases blood pressure (and thus
blood flow) to the eye. Carl Kupfer, director of the National Eye
Institute, explains: </p>

<p>For the optic nerve to be properly nourished, there, must be
an adequate amount of blood flowing to that nerve at all times,
so that if we have a drug that both lowers intraocular pressure
as well as blood pressure, we may be interfering with the supply
of blood to the optic nerve, and therefore even though the
pressure in the eye may decrease, such a patient will not be
protected against losing visual function from the glaucoma
process.128 </p>

<p>Thus, marijuana at best alleviates one problem of glaucoma
while increasing the risk of another. And in order to even
accomplish this ambivalent goal, one must stay stoned the entire
day. It is no surprise, then, that experts such as Doctor Green
conclude that &quot;marijuana. . . has little potential future as
a glaucoma medication.&quot;129 </p>

<p><b>b. Treatment for chemotherapy</b> </p>

<p>Proponents also suggest that marijuana is useful to combat the
side-effects of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting. To
support their position, they cite a study conducted by Mark
Kleiman which found that 40% of cancer specialists had
recommended marijuana to relieve chemotherapy nausea. 130 </p>

<p>First, the Kleiman study is flawed statistically and
methodologically. 57% of the doctors that Kleiman sent
questionnaires to did not even bother to return them. Also,
Kleiman does not document the number of questionnaires that were
returned unanswered. Further, Kleiman does not document the
number of questionnaires that expressed no opinion as to the
therapeutic use of marijuana. Once all of these factors are
considered, Kleiman's &quot;40%&quot; acceptance rate would be no
more than 15%, and, according to Dr. Richard Schwartz, Clinical
Professor of Pediatrics at Georgetown University School of
Medicine, is &quot;probably much less.&quot;131 </p>

<p>Second, the nation's top cancer experts reject marijuana for
chemotherapy treatment. As David Ettinger, professor of oncology
at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine notes,
&quot;There is no indication that marijuana is effective in
treating nausea and vomiting resulting from radiation treatment
or other causes. No legitimate studies have been conducted which
make such conclusions.&quot;132 Doctor John Laszlo, Vice
President of Research for the American Cancer Society agrees that
there is insufficient evidence to suggest that marijuana is a
useful chemotherapy treatment.133 </p>

<p>Third, the National Cancer Institute itself notes that
&quot;other antiemetic agents such as ondansetron,
metoclopramine, droperidol, etc. have been shown to be more
useful than marijuana-related compounds as first line
therapy.&quot;134 </p>

<p>Thus, while there is no evidence to prove marijuana's use in
chemotherapy, there are numerous alternative drugs that obviate
the need to even pursue research on the subject. </p>

<p><b>c. Treatment for AIDS</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalized drugs next suggest that marijuana is
useful in treating AIDS both because it relieves pain and because
it stimulates appetite. Unfortunately, marijuana would actually
exacerbate the health risks associated with AIDS. First, studies
conducted at the Virginia Medical College suggest that the THC in
marijuana damages the immune system, making the patient more
susceptible to colds, viruses, and influenza while at the same
time increasing the severity of any illnesses that the patient
has.135 Clearly, the last thing that a patient with AIDS needs is
to have his or her immune system weakened. Second, the marijuana
smoke itself is damaging to the AIDS patients. As Dr. Sonia
Buist, Professor of Medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University
explains, &quot;I cannot support the use of marijuana to treat
patients with this condition [AIDS]. Furthermore, I would
maintain that its use is contraindicated because marijuana smoke
is extremely irritating to the airways and may add additional
pulmonary problems in these very susceptible
individuals.&quot;136 </p>

<p><b>d. Treatment for multiple sclerosis</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization finally argue that marijuana is
useful to stop the spasms caused by multiple sclerosis. Experts
on MS absolutely reject this proposition. In fact, the scientific
opinion may be summed up by Dr. Donald Silberberg, Chair of the
Department of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania School
of Medicine and Chief of the Neurology Service at the Hospital of
Pennsylvania, when he states that </p>

<p>I have not found any legitimate medical or scientific works
which show that marijuana... is medically effective in treating
multiple sclerosis or spasticity.... The long-term treatment of
the symptoms of multiple sclerosis through the use of marijuana
could be devastating. . . . The use of (marijuana), especially
for long-term treatment ... would be worse than the original
disease itself.&quot; </p>

<p>Having proved that marijuana is not effective in the treatment
of glaucoma, the treatment of chemotherapy side-effects, the
treatment of AIDS, or the treatment of MS, we should discuss the
evidence that suggests that marijuana is harmful to one's health.
Recall the material presented in Chapter One [Addiction Rates]
that suggested that marijuana caused numerous health problems.
Let us expand upon the inquiry. First, Swedish researchers found
that people who smoked pot fifty or more times were six times as
likely to develop schizophrenia. The study specifically found
that marijuana increased the incidence of schizophrenia not only
in those patients who were predisposed to the illness, but also
in those who were not.138 Second, physicians in 1986 began
reporting cases of lung, head, neck, tongue, and respiratory
tract cancer in patients aged 17 to 39.139 Third, maternal use of
marijuana increases the risk of childhood leukemia by 1,000%.140<b>
</b>Fourth, marijuana exposure produces abnormalities similar to
the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome but at five times the rate of alcohol.
141 </p>

<p>Thus, not only is marijuana not a good medical treatment, but
it also causes schizophrenia, cancer, leukemia, and childhood
abnormalities. Consequently, it is unsurprising to learn that
&quot;marijuana has been rejected as medicine by the American
Medical Association, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the
American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology
and the American Cancer Society. Not one American health
association accepts marijuana as medicine.&quot;142 </p>

<p><b>Chapter Seven Summary Sheet: Medical Uses of Presently
Illegal Drugs</b> </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If

<p>We should allow for therapeutic use of heroin. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then
you say...</b> </p>

<p>Morphine provides longer-lasting, more consistent pain relief
than does heroin. [Robert L. McCarthy and Michael Montagne,
&quot;The argument for therapeutic use of heroin in pain
management,&quot; American Journal of Hospital Pharmacists, May
1993]. </p>

<p>If morphine does not work for a given patient, you should not
use- heroin, which is chemically very similar to morphine, but
instead should use a different opioid such as methadone. [Arthur
G. Lipman, &quot;The argument against therapeutic use of heroin
in pain management,&quot; American Journal of Hospital
Pharmacists, May 1993]. </p>

<p>The British doctors who initially advocated the therapeutic
use of heroin long ago reversed their position. [Lipman, citation
above]. </p>

<p>The American Pharmaceutical Association admits that there are
problems in pain management, but that they are due to the
tendency of doctors to fail to prescribe sufficient dosages of
presently available opioids, not because of the unavailability of
heroin. [Lipman, citation above]. </p>

<p>Allowing the therapeutic use of heroin increases the risk of
diversion-i.e. that patients will sell their drugs on the black
market rather than using it themselves. (Lipman, citation above],
</p>

<p>Allowing pharmacies to stock heroin likely would 'increase the
risk of robbery, especially when one considers that 50% of all
pharmacy burglaries are committed to steal controlled substances.
[Lipman, citation above]. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If
they say...</b> </p>

<p>Marijuana should be used to treat glaucoma. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then
you say...</b> </p>

<p>The studies which assert that marijuana helps to decrease
intraocular pressure were conducted with THC, not with marijuana
per se. [Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition;
Remand; 21 CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986].<b> </b></p>

<p>In order to see a significant decrease in intraocular
pressure, you would have to smoke so much marijuana that you
would be stoned all day. [Scheduling Petition, citation above]. </p>

<p>In fact, alcohol also decreases intraocular pressure. But as
with marijuana, you would have to consume so much that you would
be drunk all day. [Sandra S. Bennett, &quot;Therapeutic
Marijuana: Fact or Fiction,&quot; Drug Watch, July 1992]. </p>

<p>Although marijuana may reduce one symptom of glaucoma
(intraocular pressure), it also exacerbates another problem.
Specifically, marijuana decreases blood pressure and hence. blood
supply to the optic nerve- Because the optic nerve no longer
receives an adequate blood supply, it can be just as damaging to
eyesight as the high intraocular pressure itself. [Bennett,
citation above (citing Michael Van Buskirk, Director of Glaucoma
Services and Chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at </p>

<p>Devers Eye Institute)]. </p>

<p>According to Doctor Keith Green, who serves or has served on
the boards of eight prestigious eye journals, &quot;Marijuana ...
has little potential future as a glaucoma medication.&quot;
[Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition; Remand; 21
CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986]. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If
they say...</b> </p>

<p>Marijuana should be used for therapeutic treatment of the
side- effects of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then
you say...</b> </p>

<p>The study that the legalizers will probably cite-the one
conducted by Mark Kleiman, which says that 40% of doctors
questioned supported the therapeutic use of marijuana for cancer
patients--is methodologically flawed. Specifically, its return
rate (number of questionnaires returned), was only 42%, which
raises </p>

<p>the strong potential of response bias. Also, Kleiman did not
inform the reader how many of the people who did return the
questionnaire did in fact answer the questions. As one expert in
bio-statistics concluded, &quot;The report seems simple and
careless. - This is mere propaganda, and will be seen as such by
the informed reader.&quot; [Robert E. Peterson, &quot;Student
Exercise for Marijuana Activist Group Given National Media
Attention to Influence Court Case,&quot; Drug Prevention
Newsletter, June 1991). </p>

<p>As David Ettinger, professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine notes, &quot;There is no indication
that Marijuana is effective in treating nausea and vomiting
resulting from radiation treatment or other causes.&quot;
[Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial, of Petition; Remand; 21
CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986]. </p>

<p>The National Cancer Institute concluded that other drugs such
as ondansetron, metoclopramine, droperidol, etc. are more useful
for treating chemotherapy than is marijuana. [Janet Lapey,
&quot;Marijuana As Medicine Refuted by NIH Scientists,&quot; Drug
Watch, August 1992]. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If

<p>Marijuana is a useful treatment for AIDS patients. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>Studies show that marijuana actually damages one's immune
system and makes one more susceptible to colds, viruses, and
influenza. [Guy A. Cabral, Marijuana and Virus Infections,
Southeast Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities
Newsletter]. </p>

<p>Marijuana actually increases the health risk to AIDS patients
because the smoke causes pulmonary problems. [Sandra S. Bennett,
&quot;Therapeutic Marijuana: Fact or Fiction, &quot;Drug Watch,
July 1992]. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If

<p>Marijuana is a useful treatment for MS(multiple sclerosis
patients). </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then
you say...</b> </p>

<p>According to Doctor Donald H. Silberberg, Chair of the
Department of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania, there
is no evidence that marijuana helps MS, and, in fact, it likely </p>

<p>would be very harmful to the patient. [Marijuana Scheduling
Petition; Denial of Petition; Remand; 21 CFR Part 1308 (Docket
No. 86-22), 1986]. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If

<p>Marijuana on the whole is a good medicine. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>According to Swedish researchers, use of marijuana increases
the incidence of schizophrenia six-fold for long-term users.
[Marsha Keith Schuchard, &quot;Marijuana: An Environmental
Pollutant&quot; Publication of the National Parent's Resource
Institute for Drug Education, Inc.]. </p>

<p>Use of marijuana increases the threat of lung cancer, throat
cancer, tongue cancer, and head cancer. [Schuchard, citation
above]. </p>

<p>Use of marijuana by pregnant mothers increases the risk that
their child will develop leukemia by 1000%. [Schuchard, citation
above]. </p>

<p>Use of marijuana increases the risk of abnormalities similar
to those caused by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome by 500%. [Schuchard,

<p>(See also Chapter One, Addiction Rates). </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If

<p>The medical community condones the therapeutic use of
marijuana. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>Marijuana as medicine has been rejected by Medical

Justice</p>

<h2>Chapter Eight: Individual Rights and the Legalization of
Drugs </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Although proponents of legalization do not rely upon this
argument very much any more, a traditional response of the
legalizers was that &quot;It's my body and I have a right to do
with it as I please so long as I'm the only one affected.&quot;
This is called the Individual Autonomy argument. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>The obvious flaw with the Individual Autonomy argument, and
the reason why it is not used much any more, is the simple fact
that drug use does affect other people. Indeed, this entire
manual is in large part a collection of reasons and examples as
to how drug use affects not only the individual, but also
innocent third-parties and society at large. But for the sake of
clarity, let us iterate and expand upon these points. </p>

<p>First, drug use increases crime - and consequently harms other
people - in at least three different ways. For a discussion of
this, please see Chapter Two. </p>

<p>Second, drug use by pregnant women causes in utero damage to
the fetus. Children born of cocaine mothers have three times the
mortality rate and four times the low birth-weight as children
born of normal mothers.143 Similarly, &quot;coke babies&quot;
tend to have emotional traits similar to those found in people
with antisocial personality disorders.144 Unfortunately, the same
mothers who are most likely to damage their children in this way
are also the least likely to seek professional help and
treatment.145 </p>

<p>Third, drug abuse closely correlates to child abuse. For
example, in Philadelphia, cocaine is implicated in half of the
cases in which parents beat their children to death, and in 80%
of all abuse cases. 146 In the District of Columbia, 90% of those
reported for child abuse were substance abusers. 147 In 1984 the
Legal Aid Society in New York City handled 3,3 10 abuse and
neglect cases in the city. By 1989 it was handling more than
24,000.148 What happened? Crack did, beginning in 1985. Sixty
percent of abuse and neglect cases involved drug allegations. 149
The number of children wounded and killed by stray bullets in
tragic drive-by shootings pales in comparison to the impact of
cocaine in the over 1,200 child abuse murders in 1989.150 But
these problems are not mere statistics - they are horror stories.
In San Francisco, a woman who was freebasing cocaine gave birth
to twins on her living room floor. She continued to freebase and
let her children die unattended. </p>

<p>Fourth, drug use, like alcohol use, is responsible for a large
percentage of automobile accidents in the United States. In
Maryland, 32% of car crash victims tested positive for
marijuana.152 </p>

<p>Fifth, drug use among pilots and train operators also leads to
accidents. Recall the Conrail disaster discussed in Chapter Four,
wherein 16 people were killed and 175 were injured because the
train operators were high on marijuana. Furthermore, a study
conducted by Stanford University found that 24 hours after
smoking one joint, pilots could not safely land a plane.153 </p>

<p>Sixth and finally, consider all of the economic and social
costs associated with drug use in our </p>

<p>society-costs that equate to tens of billions of dollars in
lost productivity, higher taxes, and increased insurance
premiums. </p>

<p>In short, few people use the Individual Autonomy argument any
more because it is painfully </p>

<p>obvious that drug use affects not only the individual user,
but also the user's family, innocent third parties, and society
as a whole. </p>

<p>143 Ken Auletta, &quot;Six doses of reality are injected in
the argument for legal drugs,&quot; New York </p>

director of research and epidemiology for the Bureau of Maternity
Services). </p>

<p>Drug use causes increased crime. [see<b> </b>Chapter Two]. </p>

<p>Drug use by pregnant mothers causes in utero damage to the

three-fold and the risk of low birth-weight four-fold. [Ken
Auletta, &quot;Six doses of reality are injected in the argument

Maryland, 32% of car crash victims tested positive for marijuana.
[Marsha Keith Schuchard, &quot;Marijuana: An Environmental

<p>Drug use also causes pilots and train conductors to have
accidents. Recall the Conrail disaster discussed in Chapter Four,
in which 16 people died and 175 were injured. [see Chapter Four].
Also, a study conducted by Stanford University showed that 24
hours after smoking one joint, pilots could not safely land a

<h2>Chapter Nine: Legal Issues Surrounding the Legalization of
Drugs </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>This chapter deals not with an argument of the legalizers per
se, but instead their implicit belief </p>

<p>that legalizing drugs would not have a profound effect on
other facets of law and public policy. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Basically, we have three concerns here. </p>

<p>First, can drug use be used as a defense in criminal or civil
proceedings? That is, can a person </p>

<p>accused of a hit-and-run accident escape liability by noting
to the court that he was on cocaine at the time? </p>

<p>Second, what will be done with the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)? As its name suggests, the FDA is
responsible for testing the safety of food and drugs in the
United States. For example, the FDA banned the use of Red Dye #2
a number of years ago because it caused cancer (this is why there
were no red M+M's in most of the 1980's - it was not until the
candy producer came up with a noncarcenogenic dye that they
started making them again in the late 1980's). Similarly, the FDA
banned the use of the substance known as Laetrile when it
determined that this supposed drug had absolutely no
pharmacological effects. But if we allow the legal sale of drugs
such as cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and PCP - that unquestionably
are dangerous - how can we justify allowing the FDA to exercise
quality control over any other type of drugs? To allow the sale
and use of cocaine while still granting the FDA power to
regulate, say, food additives such as saccharine is like banning
slingshots but allowing people to carry automatic assault rifles.
So if we legalize the sale and use of clearly dangerous drugs, it
seems that to be logically consistent we would have to close down
the FDA and let everyone have access to every type of drug. And
given legalized drugs it also seems hypocritical to have any type
of quality control on food additives or food products more
generally. </p>

<p>A third and final concern is the legal liability of the
companies that would manufacture and sell the newly legalized
cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and PCP. This is a very important
argument, and in order to fully understand its magnitude we must
mention what are known as &quot;Dram Shop&quot; laws. If not in
name, we are all familiar with what a Dram Shop law is - it is a
law that says that if bartenders continue to serve alcohol to
people that they know are already drunk, and that drunk person
later goes out and commits a crime such as drunk driving, then
the bartender or the bar can be held responsible. So the question
remains: would producers and sellers of legalized drugs be
responsible for the actions of the people who ingest them? If the
producers and sellers <i>would not </i>be liable, we have a
serious ethical problem inasmuch as they could destroy peoples'
lives with impunity in the name of profit and not be held morally
accountable. But if the producers and sellers would be liable --
that is, a Dram Shop type of law would apply to them --we would
probably have very few companies willing to market and sell
drugs. Put differently, if a given drug company knew that it
could be hit with a ten million dollar lawsuit when one of its
clients goes and kills someone (or damages property, etc.), is
that company likely to stay in business? Not likely. The company
likely would decide that the costs of doing business outweigh the
potential benefits and thus would close down shop. For proof of
this point ask yourself the following: How many companies are
there in the U.S. today that manufacture and sell asbestos
insulation? Answer: probably none. </p>

<p>In short, there are many legal and political issues that would
have to be dealt with if we legalized </p>

<p>drugs, and nowhere in the legalizers' literature have they
come up with adequate answers to these problems. </p>

<p>Myths and Misconceptions of Drug Legalization: US Dept. of
Justice</p>

<h2>Chapter Ten: Environmental Issues and the Legalization of
Drugs </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Some extremists in the drug legalization debate suggest that
we should legalize hemp - the plant from which we get marijuana -
because hemp could be used as fiber to make clothing,
alternatives to lumber, paper products, and the like. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Some of the arguments of the legalizers are at least plausible
(plausible, but wrong). This is not one of them. The argument
that we should grow hemp for fiber is completely absurd. First,
if hemp is such a good all-purpose fiber, why isn't any country
in the world seriously growing it? Second, there was a time in
the U.S. when it was legal to grow hemp (before 1937), and no one
did. By 1937, so few people chose to grow hemp that it wasn't
even mentioned in Department of Agriculture or Department of
Commerce reports.154 If it is such a good idea, why didn't anyone
do it when they could have? </p>

<p>Finally, assume (although this assumption is contradicted by
history) that hemp could provide all of the environmental
benefits that the legalizers claim. These benefits would still
have to be weighed against the costs of allowing farmers to grow
thousands, if not millions, of acres of marijuana. It would be
impossible to have a policy that allowed the legal sale of hemp
for fiber but not for smoking, for one simply could not enforce
it. (By comparison, think of how plausible a policy would be that
said farmers could grow wheat to make bread but not to make
biscuits). Thus, in order to get the supposed benefits of
&quot;hemp as fiber,&quot; you would also have to allow people to
use it as marijuana. But when we recall all of the harms
associated with marijuana use - medical problems, lost
productivity, increased accidents, increased crime, etc. - we
find that <i>even granting </i>the supposed benefits of
&quot;hemp as fiber,&quot; these benefits are still outweighed by
the negative consequences of such a policy. </p>

<p>Thus, the &quot;hemp as fiber&quot; argument is disproved by
both history and the fact that no other countries are seriously
considering it as an option. But even granting the legalizers
arguments here, the costs of such a policy still would clearly
outweigh the benefits. </p>

<p>154 For proof of this fact the reader is invited to scan any
Agriculture or Commerce reports from 1916 to 1937. </p>

<p>When farmers could do this in the early twentieth century in

<p>If it is such a good idea, why aren't any other countries in
the world doing it now? </p>

<p>Even if we granted the supposed benefits of &quot;hemp as
fiber,&quot; (which we should not), the costs of such a program
would still clearly outweigh the benefits. <br>

<p>Myths and Misconceptions of Drug Legalization: US Dept. of

<h2>Chapter Eleven: &quot;Anything Is Better Than What We Are
Doing Now&quot; Hopelessness, Drug Control and Potential
Solutions </h2>

<p><img src="blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562" height="19">
</p>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>The final argument of the legalizers is one of hopelessness -
the status quo obviously is not working because we are spending
lots of money on the problem, and it is not yet solved.
Therefore, any policy is preferable to the present one. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Such cynicism is understandable - drugs are a pervasive
problem in our culture. But legalization is not the answer, and
in order to prove this we should look at two points: first, that
the problem is getting better, and second, that many other viable
solutions besides legalization exist. </p>

<p><b>1. The Problem is Getting Better</b> </p>

<p>A mere purview of the facts proves that our problems with
drugs are not as bad as they used to be. For example, in 1979 the
percentage of 12 to 17-yr. olds who said they had used any
illicit drug in the past month was 17.6%. In 1992, it was down to
6.1%. Similarly, the percentages for ages 18-25 yrs. dropped from
37. 1 % to 13.0%. 155 Cocaine use is also down. In 1982 the
percentage of 18-25 yr. olds reporting past month use of cocaine
was 6.8 %. In 1992 the figure had dropped to 1.8%.156
Unfortunately, the 1993 data show a bottoming out and reversal of
this trend, which has been linked to a softening attitude about
the dangers of drug use.157 </p>

<p>Not only is drug use down, but public opinion has crystallized
into a &quot;no drug tolerance&quot; position. One Gallup poll
reported that over 80% of Americans said legalizing drugs was a
bad idea.158 A large majority said they feared legalization would
lead to increases in addiction, drug overdoses, drug-related
crime and drug use in schools. 159 Furthermore, a study conducted
in 1990 showed </p>

<p>that 89% of the population would be willing to pay higher
taxes to support the War on Drugs. 160 And as discussed above,
children and adolescents have become less tolerant of drug use.
As a letter to the New York Times on May 7, 1988, written by a
class of 14 and 15 yr. olds explained, &quot;America is in a
'moral rut' and ... drug abuse is one of the main
causes.&quot;161 </p>

<p>Thus, not only is drug use declining, but public opinion grows
increasingly hostile to any such behavior. No wonder so few
people favor legalization these days. </p>

<p><b>2. Alternative Solutions</b> </p>

<p>These facts are not to suggest, however, that we should become
complacent in our efforts. Drug use continues to be a severe
social problem, and we should always be on the lookout for
innovative policies. Here are just a few ideas. </p>

<p>First, we should continue our reliance on strong legal
sanctions to deter drug use. That is, keeping drugs illegal does
decrease their use. As one commentator noted, 70% of high school
students in New Jersey and 60% of those in California said that
fear of getting in trouble with the law was a </p>

<p>primary reason not to use drugs.162 Not only do legal
sanctions keep people from trying drugs in </p>

<p>the first instance, but they also help to get people off them
later. A study conducted by Douglas </p>

<p>Anglin of UCLA noted that the potential success rate of
treatment programs depends largely on how long the patient
remains with the program. The longer you stay, the better your
chances of </p>

<p>recovery. And Anglin also found that people who enter
treatment under legal compulsion (i.e., a court order) stay in
the program longer.163 </p>

<p>Thus, legal sanctions eventually correlate to treatment
success rate. </p>

<p>Second, we should continue to decrease social tolerance for
drug use at all levels of society and at all levels of drug use.
As former DEA Administrator Jack Lawn said, &quot;Here's what it
means in shirt sleeve English. [The] public is telling the drug
user, 'What you're doing is not just your business. It's criminal
and it's unacceptable. Get help and get treatment if you need it,
or face the consequences. We don't want to be hard-hearted, but
this problem exists only because you and people like you keep it
alive. The rest of us don't want to put up with it
anymore'&quot;. 164 </p>

<p>Third, we should use education to encourage people not to use
drugs. Educating the youth is one of society's most important
responsibilities, and nowhere is the need for education greater
than to teach children about the dangers of drug use.165 Such
policies are working with regard to smoking, for as Kurt Schmoke
admits, &quot;[t]he number of people smoking continues to fall
because of a concerted public education campaign about the health
effects of smoking.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>Fourth, we should encourage private enterprise to adopt
workplace rules restricting drug use. By implementing policies
such as drug testing, businesses can greatly reduce drug use
while at the same time increasing their productivity. For
example, Hoffman Construction of Portland, Oregon, implemented
drug policies and decreased workers' compensation claims by 17%.
Indeed, by year three, Hoffman had reduced its workers'
compensation costs by almost 90%.167 Perhaps the<i> </i>government
could use tax credits to encourage businesses to promote drug
policies. </p>

<p>Fifth, it is possible that the growing health-consciousness in
the United States today (favoring more exercise, less
cholesterol, less alcohol and smoking, etc.) will go a long way
in and of itself to decrease drug use.168 </p>

<p>Finally, we may be able to turn to science for help. Some
scholars are proposing the use of biotechnology to eradicate drug
crops while at the same time planting more socially useful plants
(wheat, soybeans, corn, etc.). 169 </p>

<p>In the final analysis of the legalization debate we must
remember that drug abuse is a long-term </p>

<p>problem: it took China over fifty years to kick its opium
addiction.170 And granted, drug use still </p>

<p>takes far too large a toll on the United States. But when we
consider the decreasing tolerance for, and use of, drugs in our
country, as well as the numerous alternatives we are pursuing and
have yet to pursue, it seems clear that legalization of drugs is
not the answer. </p>

<p>Drug use has been declining: in 1979 the percentage of 12 to
17-yr. olds who said they had used any illicit drug in the past
month was 17.6%. In 1992, it was down to 6.1%. Similarly, for
ages 1825 yrs. use dropped from 37. 1 % to 13.0%. In 1982 the
percentage of 18-25 yr. olds reporting past month use of cocaine
was 6.8%. In 1992 the figure had dropped to 1.8%. [Preliminary
Estimates from the 1992 National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse,&quot; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, June
1993]. </p>

<p>Public tolerance for drug use is declining. One Gallup poll
reported that over 80% of Americans said legalizing drugs was a
bad idea- A large majority said they feared legalization would
lead to increases in addiction, drug overdoses, drug-related
crime and drug use in schools. [David Zucchino, &quot;A Push to<b>
</b>Make Drugs Illegal,&quot; Philadelphia Inquirer, July 5,
1992]. In fact, 89% of the public would be willing to<b> </b>pay
higher taxes to support the War on Drugs. [Ralph A. Weisheit and
Kathrine Johnson, &quot;Exploring the Dimensions of Support for
Decriminalizing Drugs,&quot; Journal of Drug Issues, Winter
1992]. </p>

<p>Other solutions besides legalization exist: </p>

<p>We should continue to employ legal sanctions against drug
users for two reasons. First, studies of high school students
suggest that between 60% and 70% cite not wanting to get in
trouble with the law as a reason not to use drugs in the first
place. [Robert E. Peterson, &quot;Stop Legalization of Illegal
Drugs,&quot; Drug Awareness Information Newsletter, July 1988].
Second, the use of legal sanction is a good means of keeping
addicts in treatment programs for longer periods of time, thus
increasing the probability of successful treatment [James Q.
Wilson, &quot;Against the Legalization of Drugs,&quot;
Commentary, February 1990]. </p>

<p>We should continue to decrease social tolerance for any and
all drug use at any and all levels of society. </p>

<p>We should promote drug awareness education as a means o
deterring use, as is presently being done successfully with
regard to tobacco use. </p>

<p>We should use tax incentives to encourage businesses to adopt
drug policies such as those of a Portland, Oregon business that
decreased its workers' compensation claims 90% in three years.
[&quot;Position Paper In Opposition To The Legalization of
Drugs,&quot; Regional Drug Initiative Task Force, September
1990.] </p>

<p>The general health-consciousness sweeping the country may go a
long way to decreasing casual drug use. [Ralph A. Weisheit and
Kathrine Johnson, &quot;Exploring the Dimensions of Support for
Decriminalizing Drugs,&quot; Journal of Drug Issues, Winter
1992]. </p>

<p>We should research ways in which biotechnology could be used
to eradicate drug crops and replace them with socially useful
growth such as wheat or corn. [Gabriel Nahas, &quot;A Battle Won,
A Stalemated War, and A New Strategy,&quot; Position Paper]. </p>

<p>We should remember that drug use is a long-term problem that
will take a long time to solve: it took China 50 years to kick
its opium addiction. [Gabriel Nahas, &quot;The Decline of Drugged
Nations,&quot; Wall Street Journal, July 11, 1988]. <br>

<h1>The Myth of Marijuana's Gateway Effect </h1>

<p><b>by John P. Morgan, M.D. and Lynn Zimmer, Ph.D.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The Partnership for a Drug-Free America, in cooperation with
the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the White House
Office of Drug Control Policy, recently announced a new anti-drug
campaign that specifically targets marijuana. Instead of
featuring horror tales of marijuana-induced insanity, violence
and birth detects, this campaign is built upon the premise that
reducing marijuana use is a practical strategy for reducing the
use of more dangerous drugs. </p>

<p>The primary basis for this &quot;gateway hypothesis&quot; is a
recent report by the center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
(CASA), claiming that marijuana users are 85 times more likely
than non-marijuana users to try cocaine. This figure, using data
from NIDA's 1991 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, is
close to being meaningless. It was calculated by dividing the
proportion of marijuana users who have ever used cocaine (17%) by
the proportion of cocaine users who have never used marijuana
(.2%). The high risk-factor obtained is a product not of the fact
that so many marijuana users use cocaine but that so many cocaine
users used marijuana previously. </p>

<p>It is hardly a revelation that people who use one of the least
popular drugs are likely to use the more popular ones -- not only
marijuana, but also alcohol and tobacco cigarettes. The obvious
statistic not publicized by CASA is that most marijuana users --
83 percent -- never use cocaine. Indeed, for the nearly 70
million Americans who have tried marijuana, it is clearly a
&quot;terminus&quot; rather than a &quot;gateway&quot; drug. </p>

<p>During the last few years, after a decade of decline, there
has been a slight increase in marijuana use, particularly among
youth. In 1994, 38 percent of high school seniors reported having
ever tried the drug, compared to about 35 percent in 1993 and 33
percent in 1992. This increase does not constitute a crisis. No
one knows whether marijuana use-rates will continue to rise. But
even if they do, it will not necessarily lead to increased use of
cocaine. </p>

<p>Since the 1970s, when NIDA first began gathering data, rates
of marijuana and cocaine use have displayed divergent patterns.
Marijuana prevalence increased throughout the 1970s, peaking in
1979, when about 60 percent of high school seniors reported
having used it at least once. During the 1980s, cocaine use
increased while marijuana use was declining. Since 1991, when
data for the CASA analysis were gathered, marijuana use-rates
have increased while cocaine use-rates have remained fairly
steady. </p>

<p>The over-changing nature of the statistical relationship
between use-rate for marijuana and cocaine indicates the absence
of a causal link between the use of these two drugs. Therefore,
even if the proposed Partnership campaign were to be effective in
reducing marijuana use it would not guarantee a proportional
reduction in the number of people who use cocaine. To the extent
anti-drug campaigns are effective, they seem to be most effective
in deterring those people who would have been fairly low-level
users. There is no reason to believe that anti-marijuana messages
of any sort would deter many of those marijuana users --
currently 17 percent of the total -- who also develop an interest
in cocaine. </p>

<p>Nor is there reason to believe that the Partnership's new
campaign will actually reduce the overall number of marijuana
users. For a decade now, American youth have been subjected to an
unparalleled assault of anti-drug messages. They have seen
hundreds of Partnership advertisements, on television and in the
print media. They have been urged to &quot;just say no&quot; by
rock stars, sports heroes, presidents and first-ladies. They have
been exposed to anti-drug educational programs in the schools.
Yet this is the same generation of young people that recently
began increasing its use of marijuana. It seems unlikely that
many of them will be deterred by hyperbolic claims of marijuana's
gateway effect, particularly when it contradicts the reality of
drug use they see around them. </p>

<p>If the creators of American drug policy are truly interested
in reducing the risk of marijuana users using other drugs, they
should take a closer look at Holland, where drug policy since the
1970s has been guided by a commitment to diminishing any
potential gateway effect. Wanting to keep young marijuana users
away from cocaine and other &quot;hard drugs,&quot; the Dutch
decided to separate the retail markets by allowing anyone 18
years of age or older to purchase marijuana openly in
government-controlled &quot;coffee shops&quot; which strictly
prohibit the use and sale of other drugs. </p>

<p>Despite easy availability, marijuana prevalence among 12 to 18
year olds in Holland is only 13.6 percent -- well below the 38
percent use-rate for American high school seniors. More Dutch
teenagers use marijuana now than in the past; indeed, lifetime
prevalence increased nearly three-fold between 1984 and 1992,
from </p>

<p>4.8 to 13.6 percent. However, Dutch officials consider their
policy a success because the increase in marijuana use has not
been accompanied by an increase in the use of other drugs. For
the last decade, the rate of cocaine use among Dutch youth has
remained stable, with about .3 percent of 12-18 year olds
reporting having used it in the past month. </p>

<p>In the United States, the claim that marijuana acts as a
gateway to the use of other drugs serves mainly as a rhetorical
tool for frightening Americans into believing that winning the
war against heroin and cocaine requires waging &amp; battle
against the casual use of marijuana. Not only is the claim
intellectually indefensible, but the battle is wasteful of
resources and fated to failure. </p>

<h2>ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT MARIJUANA USE </h2>

<h1>What is DEP? </h1>

<p>The Drug Education Project (DEP) is an attempt to clear up the
misinformation being propagated in the U.S. by organizations and
individuals more interested in creating works of propaganda and
fear than objective pieces of education. DEP is founded upon the
same two basic principles Andrew Weil bases his book, From
Chocolate to Morphine, upon: (1) &quot;People make decisions on
the basis of information available to them. The more accurate the
information, the better their decisions will be&quot; [68, p.
179]; and (2) &quot;There are no good or bad drugs; there are
only good and bad relationships with drugs&quot; [68, p. 27].
This leaflet is the first in a series of sixteen that will

<h3>Health Risk Myths and Realities </h3>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Marijuana
Overdose </h4>

<p>No evidence exists that anyone has ever died of a marijuana
overdose [61, p. 53 - 54]. Tests performed on mice have shown
that the ratio of cannabinoids (the chemicals in marijuana that
make you stoned) necessary for overdose to the amount necessary
for intoxication is 40,000:1 [1]. For comparison's sake, that
ratio for alcohol is generally between 4:1 and 10:1 [61, p.
227-228]. Alcohol overdoses kill about 5,000 yearly [3] but
marijuana overdoses kill no one as far as anyone can tell. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Brain
Damage </h4>

<p>Marijuana is psychoactive because it stimulates certain brain
receptors, but it does not produce toxins that kill them [7]
(like alcohol), and it does not wear them out as other drugs may
[57]. There is no evidence that marijuana use is a cause of brain
damage. Studies by Dr. Robert Heath claimed the contrary in
experiments on monkeys [4], but Heath's work has been sharply
criticized by the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy
of Sciences on three primary counts: </p>

<ol>
    <li>its insufficient sample size (only four monkeys), </li>
    <li>its failure to control experimental bias, and </li>
    <li>its misidentification of normal monkey brain structure as
        &quot;damaged&quot; [5]. </li>
</ol>

<p>A far superior experiment by the National Center for
Toxicological Research (NCTR) involving 64 rhesus monkeys that
were exposed to daily or weekly doses of marijuana smoke for a
year found no evidence of structural or neurochemical changes in
the brains of rhesus monkeys [6, 58]. Studies performed on actual
human populations will confirm these results, even for chronic
marijuana users (up to 18 joints per day) after many years of use
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In fact, following the publication of two
1977 JAMA studies, the American Medical Association (AMA)
officially announced its support for the decriminalization of
marijuana. </p>

<p>Contrary to a 1987 television commercial sponsored by the
Partnership for a Drug-Free America (PDFA), marijuana does not
&quot;flatten&quot; brain waves either. In the commercial, a
normal human brain wave was compared to what was supposedly the
(much flatter) brain wave of a 14-year-old high on marijuana. It
was actually the brain wave of a coma patient [2]. PDFA lied
about the data, and had to pull the commercial off of the air
when researchers complained to the television networks [62, p.
74]. </p>

<p>In reality, marijuana has the effect of slightly increasing
alpha-wave activity. Alpha waves are generally associated with
meditative and relaxed states which are, in turn, often
associated with human creativity [13]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Memory
</h4>

<p>Marijuana does impair short-term memory, but only during
intoxication. Although the authoritative studies on marijuana use
seem to agree that there is no residual impairment following
intoxication [5, 6, 13], persistent impairment of short-term
memory has been noted in chronic marijuana smokers up to 6 and 12
weeks following abstinence [70]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Heart
Problems </h4>

<p>It is accepted in medical circles today that marijuana use
causes no evident long-term cardiovascular problems for normal
persons. However, marijuana-smoking does cause changes in the
heart and body's circulation characteristic of stress, which may
complicate preexisting cardiovascular problems like hypertension,
cerebrovascular disease, and coronary atherosclerosis [5, p. 72].
Marijuana's effects upon blood pressure are complex and
inconsistent [5, p. 66 - 67]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Hormones
</h4>

<p>Chronic marijuana use has not been found to alter testosterone
or other sex hormone levels, despite the conclusions of Dr. R.C.
Kolodony's 1974 study. Seven similar studies have been performed
since then, the most recent by a Dr. Robert Block at the
University of Iowa [14], and none have reproduced Kolodony's
results. In contrast, heavy alcohol use is known to lower these
same testosterone levels [65]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Reproductive
Damage </h4>

<p>No trustworthy study has ever shown that marijuana use damages
the reproductive system, or causes chromosome breakage. Dr.
Gabriel Nahas reached the opposite conclusion in his experiments
performed in the early 1980s, but did so in part using the in
vitro (i.e., in test tubes and petrii dishes) cells of rhesus
monkeys. His rather unjustified claim that these changes would
also occur in human bodies in vivo (in the body) was criticized
by his colleagues and, in 1983, he renounced his own results. </p>

<p>Studies of actual human populations have failed to demonstrate
that marijuana adversely affects the reproductive system [61, 5].
Wu et al. found in 1988 a correlation between marijuana use and
low sperm counts in human males. But this is misleading because
(1) a decrease in sperm count has not been shown to have a
negative effect on fertility, and (2) the sperm count returned to
normal levels after marijuana use had ceased [5]. </p>

<p>Claims that marijuana use may impair hormone production,
menstrual cycles, or fertility in females are both unproven and
unfounded [43]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">The
Immune System </h4>

<p>Studies in which lab rats were injected with extremely large
quantities of THC have found that marijuana (in such
unrealistically huge quantities) does have an
&quot;immunosuppressive effect&quot; in those lab rats, in that
it temporarily shuts off certain cells in the liver called
lymphocytes and macrophages. These macrophages are useful in
fighting off bacterial, not viral, infections. But this is only
for the duration of intoxication [46]. There also exists some
evidence that marijuana metabolites stay in the lungs for up to
seven months after smoking has ceased, possibly affecting the
immune system of the lungs (but not by turning the cells off)
[47]. This said, doctors and researchers are still not sure that
the immune system is actually negatively affected in realistic
situations since there are no numbers to support the idea [15].
In fact, three studies showed that THC may have actually
stimulated the immune system in the people studied [16, 17, 18]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Birth
Defects </h4>

<p>Unlike alcohol, cocaine, and tobacco, studies show that there
exists no evident link between prenatal use of marijuana and
birth defects [5, p. 99] or fetal alcohol syndrome [72] in
humans. In fact, marijuana use during the third trimester has
been found to have a positive impact on birthweight [73]. It is
known that Delta-9-THC does enter the placenta [45], so mothers
are advised against consuming large quantities. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Cancer
</h4>

<p>Smoking marijuana has the potential to cause both bronchitis
and cancer of the lungs, throat, and neck, but this is generally
no different than inhaling any other burnt carbon-containing
matter since they all increase the number of lesions (and
therefore possible infections) in your airways. There are a
couple of studies that claim on the basis of carcinogens that
smoking marijuana is worse for your body than smoking a cigarette
[44], but these are rather simplified. There are actually some
very convincing reasons to believe that smoking cigarettes is
relatively more dangerous to the body than smoking marijuana on
more than one count: (1) It is accepted by a growing number of
scientists today that all American cigarettes contain significant
levels of polonium-210 [22], the same sort of radiation given off
by the plutonium of atom bombs (ionizing alpha radiation). It
just so happens that the tobacco plant's roots and leaves are
especially good at absorbing radioactive elements from
uranium-containing phosphate fertilizers that are required by
U.S. law, and from naturally occurring radiation in the soil,
air, and water [48]. It is the opinion of C. Everette Koop that
this radioactivity, not tar, accounts for at least 90% of all
smoking-related lung cancer [29]. Other estimates that have been
made are, about 50% according to Dr. Joseph R. DiFranza of the
Univ. of Mass. Medical Center [48] and according to Dr. Edward
Martell, a radiochemist with the National Center for Atmospheric
Research, 95% [35]. Dr. R.T. Ravenholt, former director of World
Health Surveys at the Centers for Disease Control, agrees with
the risk, asserting that &quot;Americans are exposed to far more
radiation from tobacco smoke than from any other source&quot;
[49]. Supporting the radioactivity notion is the finding that (a)
Relatively high levels of polonium-210 have been found in both
cigarette smoke [59] and the lungs of both smokers and nonsmokers
alike [60]; (b) Smokers of low-tar-and-nicotine cigarettes die of
lung cancer just as much as smokers of other cigarettes [39]; and
also, (c) Even the most potent carcinogen that has been found in
cigarettes, benzopyrene, is only present in quantities sufficient
to account for about 1% of the lung cancer cases that occur from
smoking[49]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Why
don't you know any of this? </h4>

<p>Because the tobacco industry is suppressing the information.
(2) Tobacco smoke is theorized to work as a kind of
&quot;magnet&quot; for airborne radioactive particles such as
radon, causing them to deposit in your lungs instead of on walls,
rugs, or draperies [48]. (3) Tobacco, unlike marijuana, contains
nicotine, which may harden arteries and cause many of the cases
of heart disease associated with tobacco use. It also breaks down
into cancer-promoting chemicals called N Nitrosamines when
burned, and perhaps even when it is inside the body [37]. (4) THC
is a bronchial dilator, which means it works like a cough drop by
opening up your lungs and therefore aiding in the clearance of
smoke and dirt. Nicotine has the exact opposite effect. (5)
Unlike the chemicals in marijuana, nicotine has a paralyzing
effect on the tiny hairs along the body's air passages. These
hairs normally work to keep foreign matter out of the lungs. This
means that carcinogenic tar from cigarette smoke is relatively
much harder to purge from your lungs than is that from marijuana.
And finally, (6) Marijuana users smoke significantly less than
cigarette smokers do because of both marijuana's psychoactive
properties (this is called &quot;auto-titration&quot;) and
nicotine's high potential for physical addiction [21]. It is
important to note that the NCTR study found no signs of lung
cancer in its autopsied rhesus monkeys who had smoked marijuana
for one year [6]. </p>

<p>Smoking cigarettes and smoking marijuana negatively affect
different areas of the body, and therefore cause different
problems. But everything considered, marijuana-only smokers who
average 3 - 4 joints per day show similar symptoms to cigarette
smokers who polish off 20 in a day [74]. Although one well-done
study tells us that frequent marijuana smokers have a 19% greater
risk of respiratory diseases than people who smoke nothing at all
[66], it seems that neck and throat cancers are much more likely
to result than lung cancer or emphysema. This is because, unlike
tobacco, marijuana does not penetrate deeply into the lung. In
order to minimize the risk of acquiring neck or throat cancer
from marijuana smoke, it is best to (1) avoid as much as possible
cigarette-smoking and heavy drinking while smoking marijuana, and
(2) eat plenty of vegetables (such as carrots, broccoli, squash,
and sprouts) or vitamin supplements of beta carotene, vitamins A,
C and E, and selenium [65]. These are believed to impede cancer's
progress. </p>

<p>In addition, there are actually things that can be done to
reduce and even entirely eliminate the bodily harm that may
potentially result from smoking marijuana. This is possible
because all of the principle psychoactive ingredients of
marijuana (THC and the cannabinoids) are neither mutagenic
(gene-mutating) nor carcinogenic (cancer-causing) [65]. </p>

<p>Legalizing marijuana would make (better) water bongs and
marijuana foods, drinks, and pills both less expensive and more
accessible. Smoking marijuana through a water-filled bong will
cool the smoke and there is reason to believe that it will filter
some of the carcinogens [69, 36]. Eating or drinking marijuana
effectively eliminates all negative effects. In addition, it is
conceivable that an aerosol contraption or vaporizer, commonly
called a tilt pipe, could easily be constructed that would
surpass joints in efficiency, match them in onset and control of
effects, and yet would be effectively harmless to the body. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Fat
Cells </h4>

<p>One of the more ridiculous myths being circulated is that
marijuana stays in your fat cells and can keep you high for
months. Even though they may have similar names, the psychoactive
THC (Delta-9-THC) is different from the metabolites (for
instance, 11-OH-THC and 11-nor) that your body breaks it down
into in that the latter will not get you stoned. It is the
metabolites that stay in your fatty cells and show up on drug
tests. Your body is depleted of Delta-9-THC only hours after
ingestion [40, 41]. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<h3>Other MJ Myths and Realities </h3>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Amotivational
Syndrome </h4>

<p>Amotivational syndrome is defined as a condition in which a
person loses ambition or motivation to complete tasks that he
would normally like to have completed. Claims made in the 60's
that marijuana use resulted in amotivational syndrome were
predominantly founded on stereotypes. But more recently, the
carefully-designed NCTR study has actually confirmed these
suspicions under certain conditions. It found that marijuana use
may consistently produce something akin to amotivational syndrome
in adolescent monkeys. It did not however prove that marijuana
makes adolescents apathetic or depressed. A full recovery to
normal motivation levels was typically observed to occur between
two to three months following cessation of exposure. For unknown
reasons, one monkey was observed to never fully recover.
Surprisingly, the willingness to work appeared to be equally
affected in both the daily and weekend rhesus smokers in the
study [6]. Other studies have failed to prove amotivational
syndrome in adults [42], so there is much reason to believe that
this effect only occurs during adolescent use. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Marijuana
Potency </h4>

<p>Marijuana is not significantly more potent today than it has
been in the past [23]. It is generally agreed that this myth was
the result of bad data. The researchers making the claims used as
their baseline the THC content of marijuana seized by police in
the early 1970's, which had deteriorated since then because of
poor storage conditions [23]. In reality, it seems that domestic
marijuana's average potency probably doubled in the 70's with the
advent of sinsemilla, but has remained more or less constant
since then [65]. Scare tactics claiming that marijuana potency
has increased are rather irrelevant anyways since marijuana users
typically stop smoking when the desired effect is achieved (once
again, &quot;auto-titration&quot;). Contrary to one of DARE's
allegations [28], it is generally agreed that marijuana does not
create a tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, or physical dependence
in the user. Lester Grinspoon adds, &quot;there are many who
assert that there is nevertheless drug dependence because of
[marijuana's] capacity to generate psychic dependency. However it
is not at all clear that this type of dependency is essentially
any different from that which a man may develop with respect to
his trousers, his automobile, or his wife&quot; [61, p. 234]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Driving
</h4>

<p>Driving in any inebriated state is adding complication to what
already amounts to a constant life-threatening situation. That
said, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration
(NHTSA) summarized all of its studies by saying that there was
&quot;no indication that marijuana by itself was a cause of fatal
accidents,&quot; and that alcohol was by far the &quot;dominant
problem&quot; in drug-related accidents [32]. The Victorian
Institute of Forensic Pathology and Monash University's
Department of Forensic Medicine in Melbourne, Australia have
found that drivers who use cannabis are actually less likely to
cause fatal accidents than drug-free drivers, and are no more
likely than other drivers to be killed or seriously injured in
road accidents [33]. One experiment tested marijuana-intoxicated
drivers on both a closed course and on a crowded city street. It
found that the elements of driving most affected were
concentration and judgment [52]. An experiment involving a
driving simulator that tested actual driving ability according to
how many mistakes are incurred by sober, drunk, and high subjects
found that marijuana, unlike alcohol, does not significantly
affect driving ability. It was found that these results hold true
for even higher doses (within reason) and inexperienced marijuana
users. In fact, the only significant difference reported by the
stoned subjects was an altered perception of time, which
effectively made them drive relatively slower [50]. A similar
study found that marijuana additionally impairs the driver's
ability to attend to peripheral stimuli [71]. One theory
attempting to explain these surprising findings states that
marijuana users, in instances requiring seriousness, are in fact
able to willingly &quot;bring themselves down,&quot; such that
they are no longer high [51]. Studies that in the past have shown
that marjuana-intoxicated drivers cause significantly more
accidents than sober drivers are typically unreliable on one or
more of the following counts: (1) They use drug tests to
determine whether or not a person is high, and drug tests in use
only indicate use over the past 30 days; (2) Some studies have
not corrected for alcohol use, or do not provide a control group;
and (3) In many studies there were relatively more stoned drivers
killed, but it was not their fault. And when the police
&quot;culpability scores&quot; were tallied and factored in,
marijuana was generally not to blame for the accidents. It must
be emphasized however that one study shows that daily marijuana
smokers tend to have a 30% higher risk of injuries than non-users
[66]. In fact, accidents resulting from intoxication are thought
to be &quot;the number one hazard of marijuana use&quot; [67]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">The
Gateway Effect </h4>

<p>Marijuana use has not been found to act as a gateway drug to
the use of harder drugs. Studies show that when the Dutch
partially legalized marijuana in the 70's, heroin and cocaine use
substantially declined, despite a slight increase in marijuana
use [24]. If the stepping stone theory were true, use should have
gone up rather than down. In reality, it appears that marijuana
use tends to substitute for the use of relatively more dangerous
hard drugs like cocaine and heroin, rather than lead to their
use. Thus, oftentimes strict marijuana laws themselves are the
most significant factor involved in moving on to harder drugs
like cocaine. Such is the case in Nevada and Arizona, the states
toughest on marijuana use [65]. A recent study by Columbia
University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse attempts to
show, like many past studies have, that marijuana users are more
likely to use heroin or cocaine. But what the study actually does
show is that a large number of heroin or cocaine users have used
marijuana, not the reverse. What is not mentioned is that just as
many or even more had probably also drank alcohol, smoked
cigarettes, had sex, or eaten sandwiches prior to their hard drug
use. In fact, a National High School survey tells us that in
1990, 40.7% of all high school students had tried marijuana or
hashish at least once, whereas only 9.4% and 1.3% had ever used
cocaine and heroin, respectively [25]. Thus, at maximum, only 23%
of marijuana users go on to use cocaine, and only 3% go on to use
heroin. Thus, the stepping stone theory fails on even empirical
grounds. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Marijuana
and Crime </h4>

<p>DARE literature would have you believe that there exists a
strong correlation between marijuana use and juvenile and young
adult crime [28]. And a recent study attempts to present a link
between marijuana use and violence by stating that 2/3 of all
students who admit to taking a gun to school at least once had
smoked marijuana. In fact, DEA head Thomas Constantine recently
stated in a Washington Times interview that &quot;Many times
people talk about the nonviolent drug offender. That is a rare
species. There is not some sterile drug type not involved in
violence who is contributing some good to the community; that is
ridiculous. They are contributing nothing but evil.&quot; But
these allegations are unsupported by research because test
results show that changes in personality resulting from marijuana
use, even though they are not relatively significant, include
among other things a lessening of aggressive trends [34]. And
large population studies such as the La Guardia report [10] have
found that, if anything, marijuana use inhibits antisocial
activity such as violence [20]. The drug-inspired violence myth,
including a comprehensive history of its conception, is discussed
at great length in Lester Grinspoon's book, where it is shown to
be based largely on a distorted Persian story that is hundreds of
years old [61]. The problem inherent in drawing conclusions based
on correlations such as the 2/3 statistic above is that causality
cannot be inferred from correlation. In other words, there is no
way of determining whether marijuana use contributed in some way
to the existence of certain traits of marijuana users, i.e.
bringing a gun to school, or, as seems entirely more likely,
people with such traits are drawn to marijuana use. One study
found that chronic marijuana users had significantly higher WAIS
IQ scores (113.08) than both moderate users (102.15) and nonusers
(103.26) [30]. It is simply impossible to make sense of such
statistics as presented. </p>

<h2><font size="3">THE &quot;SCIENTIFIC&quot; JUSTIFICATION FOR
URINE DRUG TESTING</font></h2>

<p><font size="3">John Morgan, Medical professor and acting
Chairman of Pharmacology, City University of New York Medical
School</font></p>

<p><font size="3">KANSAS LAW REVIEW, 1988, Vol. 36, pp. 683-697</font></p>

<hr>

<h3><font size="3">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">Just as drug use is often ceremonial and
ritualistic, discussions about those problems have a communal,
worshipful character. Individuals have to speak out of strong
conviction, and congregational beliefs are strengthened in a
confirmation of faith and shared attitudes. In recent years, the
experiences described above have been characterized by an
important cohesive element, a shared litany.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Since 1984, when urine testing of unimpaired
civilian workers began to expand rapidly, its public supporters
have used a common set of statements, ideas, and statistics to
justify the imposition of the forced detection and testing of
urine for illegal drugs. The use of this religious language is
not without a purpose. Litany is seldom questioned, nor is the
speaker of litany often called upon to prove the truth of his
statements, even when they involve things material and not
spiritual. I believe this common set of statements used by those
justifying and selling urine tests is repeated, polished, and
accepted with a minimal offering of proof. In this article, I
will identify these statements, search for their sources, and
examine their accuracy.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3">II. THE FIRESTONE &quot;STUDY&quot;</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">Obviously, statements concerning the job
performance of drug users have an impact on their employers. From
the earliest days of the debate, a series of statistics about
drug-using workers, their poor productivity, and high cost to
ther company have been presented. In one of the first proceedings
of a meeting directed to the issues of drug abuse in the
workplace, Robert Angarola and Judith Brunton stated:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A recent study....suggests that drug users were
almost four times as likely to be involved in a plant accident
and were two and one-half times as likely to be absent from work
for more than a week than employees who did not use drugs. Drug
users were five times as likely to file workers' compensation
claims and they received three times the average level of sick
benefits. (1) Further, the drug users were &quot;repeatedly
involved in grievance procedures.&quot; The Angarola-Brunton
document was published in 1984 but they and others had begun
making the remarks frequently by then</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In 1987 testimony before the U.S. House of
Representatives, by Mark de Bernardo of the United States Chamber
of Commerce:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">'recreational' drug users are</font></p>

<p><font size="3">-----2.2 times more likely to request early
dismissal or time off... </font></p>

<p><font size="3">--3.6 times more likely to injure themselves or
another person in a workplace accident</font></p>

<p><font size="3">--5.0 times more likely to file a worker's
compensation claim. (3)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For at least five years, these statistics and
others like them have been voiced and published by testing
advocates, although seldom with de Bernardo's decimal-point
precision. Those whom I have quoted seem to be referring to any
user of illegal drugs and de Bernardo specifically speaks of
recreational drug user. Yet, one might wonder how these data were
gathered, particularly since drug testing in the workplace is
proposed to uncover the secret user. How were these users
described by Angarola and de Bernardo (and many others) found and
analyzed? The answer, as is often the case is simple. They were
not.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The most important source for dissemination of
these statistics seems to be the Drug Abuse and Alcoholism
Newsletter of Dr. Sidney Cohen. (4) This monthly newsletter is
widely distributed and has been collected and published. In the
August 1983 newsletter, Cohen discussed a study by the Firestone
Tire and Rubber Company and constructed the quotable statements
which have appeared and reappeared: &quot;Drug users were five
times as likely to file a Workers' Compensation claim, and they
received three times the average level of sick benefits.&quot;
(5)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Firestone &quot;Study&quot; has never been
published. Thus, Cohen's newsletter seems to be the source of all
such statements. Yet, Cohen gave no attribution nor sources, and
when I wrote to him in 1985 he answered that he did not have a
copy of the study and suggested I write Firestone. After a number
of calls and queries I received a two page document from
Firestone's Medical Director, E. Gates Morgan. The report apears
to be an in-house newsletter. (6) In it, a Mr. Ed Johnson is
interviewed about the Employer Assistance Program
(&quot;EAP&quot;) at Firestone. There are some statements
pertaining to absenteeism, but these are not documented, and more
importantly, refer only to a few alcoholics who have been served
by the Firestone EAP. The statistics generated (if these
calculations based on alcoholics were actually made) have nothing
to do with drug users, recreational or otherwise.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The statistics cited about absenteeism and
workers' compensation claims may have been derived from
interviews with alcoholic workers enrolled in the EAP at
Firestone. These people were not identified by urine testing for
alcohol, but were referred because they or others perceived that
their lives were falling apart. They, unlike workers randomly
tested for drug use, were dysfunctional. To use them as a
justification for testing unimpaired workers is like demanding
that all workers have mandatory periodic rectal temperatures
taken because a case of tuberculosis was found in the workplace.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3">III. THE RTI STUDY FOR DIMINISHED PRODUCTIVITY</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">The Research Triangle Institute
(&quot;RTI&quot;) of North Carolina issued a report in 1984 that
attempted to calculate the economic cost to society of alcohol
and drug abuse and mental illness. (7) It appears to be the
source of the claim that drug abuse costs the United States
thirty-four billion dollars a year in lost productivity. (8)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This claim seems to indicate that somehow
individual worker productivity was assessed by some quantitative
measure and was noted to be seriously diminished. I often ask my
students how they would design a study which might quantify the
effect of drug use or abuse on productivity and they generate
interesting ideas and designs. None, however, have ever come up
with anything as creative as the RTI report.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The National Institute on Drug Abuse
(&quot;NIDA&quot;) Household Survey is the actual source of the
RTI statistics. (9) The RTI analysis itself does not include any
studies about productivity, dor does it document that drug use
was associated with any diminished productivity. The RTI report
relied on the 1982 version of the Household Survey, which
included a question to the adult (older than eighteen years of
age) respondents about daily marijuana use. If the respondent
stated that he or she had ever used marijuana daily for twenty or
thirty days in one month, this respondent's household income was
compared to another household without a daily user. The user
households were estimated to have a household income
approximately twenty-eight percent less than those households
that did not have such an interviewee. According to the RTI
report: &quot;These result have been used to calculate the
reduced productivity due to daily marijuana use. Once again, the
prevalence rates of ever using marijuana daily in the labor force
by age and sex groups....were applied to the number of persons in
the labor force from those groups that experienced
reducedproductivity. This number was multiplied by the expected
productivity in the workplace and in the household and then by
the impairment rate (27.9 percent) to produce the final value:
The loss due to marijuana abuse was estimated at $34.2 billion
for 1980.&quot; (10)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This somewhat opaque quotation means that the
$34 billion &quot;lost&quot; to drug-induced diminished
productivity and the one-third reduction is productivity of the
drug user come from a very unusual calculation. The homes with
daily users had a reduced household income. Because the daily
users all were between eighteen and thirty-four years of age, the
proportion of the work force represented by them was multiplied
by total income expected and this was multiplied by the reduction
figure to generate the $34 billion guess. I have never seen a
published analysis of the RTI study. It is a complex and detailed
document of one hundred thirty-seven pages whose appendices
number nearly one hundred thirty more. Although many of its
assumptions regarding the cost of alcohol and drug abuse are
questionable, I have focused only on the loss of productivity
formulation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The reduced income figure itself may be
incorrect. It relies upon reports from interviewees that they
used drugs and relies upon their estimates of household income.
The income data were grouped in seven broad categories with
intervals as broad as $10,000. (11) To generate the reduction
figure with categories like this amounts to measuring centimeters
using a device graduated in meters. The control households were
generated by selecting a household whose respondent resembled the
marijuana use respondent. This meant that the two respondents
resembled each other in regard to age, education, marital status,
and occupation. (12) The similarities did not include race,
location, or nonchildren resident(s) in the household. Therefore,
a twenty-four year-old single black, high school graduate
brick-layer who smokes marijuana and lives with his grandmother
and uncle in Harlem, could have his family income compared to a
twenty-four year-old single white, high school graduate,
brick-layer living with his parents in an affluent New Jersey
suburb. If the household in Harlem had a lower income, it would
be attributed to diminished productivity caused by marijuana use.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As the RTI authors noted, however, the
association between marijuana use and reduced income is not
necessarily causal. (13) Although age and occupation were
similar, the user may not have concerned himself with income and
may have made other job choices. (14) Moreover, the heavy use of
marijuana could have been secondary to job loss in a poor
economy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This manipulation, which assigned lost
productivity to sometime past heavy use of marijuana, did not
show any association with current use of marijuana (or any other
drug), nor could it show any productivity decrease due to past
use of any other drug. It also could not show any effect of any
drug use in any person greater than age thirty-five. (15) Thus,
according to the study, regular use of marijuana in the past on
the part of females aged twenty-five to thirty-four cost the
nation $2,396,000,000. (16) However, marijuana use by females
greater than thirty-four, cost the nation nothing. (17) In males
aged twenty to twenty-four, regular marijuana use in the past
would have cost the economy $6,723,000,000. (18) On this basis,
however, any use of cocaine, prescription drugs, or phencyclidine
(PCP) by this group cost the nation nothing. Of course, the study
really does not indicate this because its inadequacy prevented
any such calculations. Its inadequacy regarding the marijuana
calculations should be viewed in the same fashion. To stand in
front of an audience and say that drug use cost the nation $34
billion dollars in decreased productivity is foolish and
improper. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Readers may have noted that the past paragraphs
followed the mode of the RTI report and used income and
productivity as equivalents. I do not believe they are
equivalents. Are those who choose to work in positions where they
earn less than the maximum possible less productive? If so, a
judge is less productive than a practicing lawyer, a medical
school professor is less productive than a practicing physician,
a farmer is less productive than a florist, and an elementary
school teacher is less productive than an owner of a day-care
center.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3">IV ILLEGAL DRUG USE IS DECLINING</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">In an affidavit filed in support of the federal
government's attempt to promote urine testing of certain federal
employees under the President's executive order, J. Michael Walsh
characterized the drug problems in America as pervasive:
&quot;Overall, 70.4 million Americans age 12 and over 37% of the
population have used marijuana, cocaine or other illicit drugs at
least once in their lifetime. Nineteen percent of the population
age 12 and over 36.8 million have used illicit drugs at least
once in the past year, and 12 % at least once during the month
prior to being surveyed.&quot; (19)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Walsh himself later notes that of the 70.4
million Americans who have tried an illicit drug at least once in
their lives, for most (sixty two million) that drug was
marijuana. (20) Many of the proponents of testing use such data.
Proponents, however, do not often seem to notice that this same
data reveals that almost fifty percent of those who have ever
used an illegal drug at least once have not used an illegal drug
in the past year and perhaps never will again. (21)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The sources of these data are important and
interesting and merit careful attention. There are two important
surveys funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse from which
most of our knowledge about the use of illegal drugs in the
United States is derived. These surveys are the National
Household Survey and the annual High School Senior Survey. (22)
Both surveys, however, were not constructed to signal serious
heavy drug use: &quot;The unique contribution of serveys of the
general population lies in their ability to furnish prevalence
estimates that include many forms of drug use that never come to
the attention of medical and legal authorities.....Survey
responses permit classification of drug-using behavior along a
continuum of involvement, substituting empirical for arbitrary
definitions of medically or socially pathologic conditions, and
emphasizing the typical nature of the phenomenon rather than its
most dramatic manifestations.&quot; (23)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">These words from the forward to the National
Household Survey published in 1983 seem particularly calm in the
light of the frequent repetition of its glaring numbers to induce
employers and others to join in the zealot's game. The National
Household Survey is a general population survey of household
members aged twelve and above and has been conducted every two to
three years since 1971. It excludes individuals in
institutionalized settings (colleges, prisons, military bases)
and, therefore, as conservative. Because each respondent gives
general data, it can monitor trends by age and sex and other
demographic variables.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The annual High School Senior Survey obtains
self-reported information from approximately 130 high schools in
the continental United States. Between 16,000 and 18,000 seniors
are surveyed. In addition, the investigators construct a sub
sample of individuals from each class who are followed, yielding
a longitudinal study. These two surveys do not yield a horrible
story of an American decline into profligate drug use, but
exactly the opposite. Table I depicts data from the Household
Survy regarding marijuana use over time. (24) Since 1979, the
data indicate a significant decline in use among the two
important youth groups. In the eighteen to twenty-five group, the
percentage of the population that had ever used marijuana
declined from 68.2% to 60.5% Those who had used marijuana in the
year preceeding the survey declined from 46.9% to 37% and in the
last month preceeding the survey, from 35.4% to 21.9%.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Unable to duplicate Tables, charts, and graphs
which follow in original text)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">These national trends also are reflected in the
High School Senior Survey (Table II). (25) The apex of marijuana
use in this group also was noted in 1979 and has steadily
declined. Marijuana use in the month preceeding the survey fell
from 33.7% to 23.4%. Daily use has steadily declined from 10.3%
to 4.0%</font></p>

<p><font size="3">During the growing clamor to test working
Americans, interest in marijuana, the most widely-accepted
illegal drug, has declined, and declined significantly. This fact
is not stressed by those frequently quoting the two survey
instruments. The use of cocaine shows a different but still
hopeful pattern. Between 1974 and 1985, the lifetime prevalence
of cocaine use increased from 5.4 million users to 22.2 million
users. (26) However, the trend in the High School Senior Survy
showed a distinct leveling off between 1982 and 1985 with a
slight decrease. (27) In 1987, cocaine use by high school
students and young adults dropped twenty percent. (28) Again, a
quarter of those reporting cocaine use had not used the drug in
the last year. The decline noted for marijuana has occurred in
most drug categories in the High School Survey including a
decline in current and daily use of alcohol. (29)</font></p>

<h2><font size="3">THE 'SCIENTIFIC' JUSTIFICATION FOR URINE DRUG
SCREENING</font></h2>

<p><font size="3">Dr. John Morgan</font></p>

<p><font size="3">KANSAS LAW REVIEW, VOL. 36, 1988, PP. 683-697
(PART II)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">V. INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND RAILROAD EMPLOYEES</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Among the fears fueling the drive to test is
the specter of industrial accidents and the likelihood of
intoxicated workers harming other workers and the public. The
lack of data that drug use in industry is harmful or an important
cause of accidents does not deter the frequent attribution of
accidents to drug use. Nowhere is this discussion more focused
than on transportation. It is impossible to raise arguments about
testing without provoking commentary on intoxicated airplane
pilots and locomotive engineers. Perhaps the strongest impetus to
testing occurred on January 4, 1987, when a Conrail engineer, who
later tested positive for marijuana, ignored a number of warning
devices and pulled his train into the path of an Amtrak
Metroliner. (30) Sixteen people were killed. (31)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">From February 10, 1986 to January 15, 1987,
under the auspices of the Federal Railroad Administration
(&quot;FRA&quot;), most American rail carriers conducted an
incident-based testing program. Any train accident or incident
associated with a fatality, injury, or nontrivial property damage
resulted in the testing of all operating personnel--- including
the train crews, dispatcher, and policemen. One hundred
seventy-five events in the year led to the testing of 759
employees. (32) Of the 759 employees sampled, 43 tested positive
for controlled substances including alcohol. (33) Of the
forty-three positives, the drugs identified were as follows:
Alcohol = 9 (1.2%) Illicit drugs = 29 (3.8%) Other controlled
substances = 14 (1.8%). (34)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The FRA made public the specific results only
for the alcohol and illicit drug positives, so it was not
possible to know which licit drugs (one assumes obtained by
prescription) were identified in the fourteen workers. Of the
twenty-nine (3.8%)positives for illicit drugs, eighteen had only
THC carboxylic acid (marijuana metabolite). five had only
benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite) and six had both. (35) One
individual who tested positive for methamphetamine also had
tested positive for marijuana and is included in the eighteen.
Despite its listing as illicit, methamphetamine is still
available in the United States as a licit appetite depressant.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The FRA document correctly noted that these
&quot;data are not conclusive of alcohol/drug role in industrial
accidents.&quot; (36) Indeed, of the twenty-nine, at least seven
had job classifications which would seem to place them at a
distance from operating decisions (track patrolman, ticket taker,
conductor, road master). (37) This costly program is not cited
for what appears to be significant evidence that illicit drugs do
not play an obvious role in industrial rail accidents.
Furthermore, there is no reason to believe that an investigation
of other industrial accidents would yield a different picture.
VI. MARIJUANA ISSUES</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Because most workplace positives are due to
marijuana metabolite and most arguments revolve around the
putative dangers of off-the-job marijuana use, the details of
cannabinoid testing are important. A review of these details is,
however, beyond the scope of this article. (38) However, three
points involving marijuana that are commonly used to provoke
testingt merit some discussion. First, the fat storage and
carry-over effect of marijuana. Second, the airplane simuator
testing study. Finally, the growing potency of domestically
available marijuana.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A. Fat Storage and Effect</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The persistence and storage of THC and other
cannainoids after use is subject to much discussion and
misunderstanding. Figure 1 depicts the length of time THC remains
in the plasma after an individual smokes marijuana containing
delta-9-THC (the intoxicating ingredient in marijuana). (39) The
pattern of distribution follows, with some simplification, what
pharmacologists refer to as a two-compartment model. The drug
initially enters the blood stream (compartment I) and then is
rapidly distributed to the deep compartment II, which is most of
the body. The initial rapidly declining concentration curve
represents the disappearance from the blood stream through
distribution. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Unable to show Figure 1)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Three to four hours after the initial
ingestion, the concentration of delta-9-THC has fallen below 2-5
ng. ml in the blood. (40) This concentration represents the
minimal effective concentration. (41) Below this concentration in
the blood, the drug exerts no demonstrable effect. We assume that
like other drugs, the concentration has fallen so that the
complementary concentration in the brain and other receptor
tissue is below the threshold which will produce an effect.
However, delta-9-THC remains in the body.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The second phase of the disapearance curve is
nearly level because its decline is so gradual. This phase
represents to some degree the drug's redistribution from
compartment II to compartment I. This slow decline is used to
calculate the terminal half-life (T 1/2) of THC. A low
concentration, say 1.0 ng ml, will take more than twenty-four
hours to fall to .05 ng / ml. (42) Actually, it probably takes
even more time, but an accurate calculation is difficult because
of the inability to measure extremely low concentrations.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This slow decline is the source of the
popularly-held concept that THC persists in the body's fat. From
this another speculation usually follows. The speculation is that
the THC still is exerting some effect. Current evidence simply
says this is not so. There are many speculations about the
long-lasting effects of THC, but in the nearly thirty years since
delta-9-THC was discovered, nothing has been verified. The brain
actually contains little fat and there is no evidence to support
the idea that the drug particularly persists there. Frequent
users will carry the drug and its metabolites with them--even to
the workplace--but they also will carry some amount of
organochlorine pesticide, lead, and the hydrocarbon solvent used
at work. We might better and more profitably examine the long
term effects of these substances.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">B. Airplane Simulator Testing In Private Pilots</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To justify the intrusion of testing, studies
purporting to show a lasting effect of marijuana have been widely
cited. Marijuana users and their defenders frequently state that
marijuana use-off-the-job is no different than alcohol use
off-the -job. The effects of marijuana and the selective
impairment generated by its use dissipate within three to four
hours and generally correlate with the decline in serum
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to levels of less than 5 ng / ml. (43)
The studies of Herbert Moskowitz and Robert Petersen that
indicate impairment of some psychomotor function for up to eight
hours (44) are puzzling and not entirely scientifically
acceptable. However, assuming they are correct, they still do not
indicate that off-the-job drug use causes on-the-job impairment.
A study by Dr. Jerome Yesavage is another matter. (45) This study
using flight simulators has been widely discussed and previously
used as a strategic justification for urine testing. (46) The
study identifies significant impairment twenty-four hours after
smoking marijuana in a group of volunteer pilots who performed on
a flight simulator. (47) These conclusions are striking and have
not yet been replicated or confirmed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">After careful analysis of the article, I think
that the experimental methodology was so flawed that the study
does not prove impairment at twenty-four hours. (48) Briefly, the
study was uncontrolled and, therefore, scientifically unreliable.
The subjects were studied with no placebos or attempts to conceal
the active treatment. Subject efforts at a control run were
compared to their efforts after they, and the investigators, knew
that they had consumed an active drug. This violates elementary
rules of study design and constitutes a serious flaw in the
study. The study also fails to deal with the characteristics and
prior drug experience of the volunteers, the issues of repeated
testing and training upon the simulator, and the generation of a
large number of simulator-generated measures some of which may
have varied by chance. (49)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">C. THC Content (Potency) of Domestically
Available Marijuana</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A commonly stated and widely accepted belief is
that marijuana's past record of causing minimal harm to users was
based on the use of low-grade material. Many plants, particularly
those growing wild, have a low content of delta-9-THC. (50) It is
often stated that the THC content has increased greatly. In fact,
critics and proponents of testing sound like dealers extolling
the power of Hawaiian and California grown material. &quot;A
glance at the percentages of THC in confiscated marijuana
would....[indicate] that marijuana is now as strong as hashish in
THC content,&quot; (51) This particular claim also has been
difficult to document. However, NIDA has funded a THC analysis
program at the University of Mississippi since 1980. Under the
program, the University analyzes plants received chiefly by law
enforcement agents, both federal (Drug Enforcement Agency) and a
variety of city and state criminal agencies. The accompanying
table lists the findings since 1980. (52)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Year # of samples Mean THC% 1980 35 4.64 1981
129 2.92 1982 148 2.57 1983 387 1.98 1984 330 2.55 1985 842 2.21
1986 800 1.86 1987 (Sept 100 2.5</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The sampling is irregular but chiefly reflects
material seized by these agencies from the back yards, frms, and
even indoor hydroponic systems of growers. The most suspect year,
1980, of course, is the only one in which the mean percentage
exceeded three percent. There has been no real change and
certainly no real increase in marijuana potency in the 1980's.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Interestingly, significant variation in THC
content of marijuana does not necessarily result in greater
delivery. In a study of the delivery of THC into smoke under
standard conditions, 16-19% of the THC content of a cigarette
actually appeared in the smoke. (53) Increasing the THC content
under some circumstances did not influence delivery. For example,
cigarettes carefully prepared to contain 1.6% THC and 3.1% THC
delivered the same amount of THC in smoke. (54)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">VII. CONCLUSIONS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This article has examined a series of
rationales for the imposition of urine testing onto unimpaired
American workers. I have tried in good faith to examine the
arguments from the perspective of empirical studies and
appropriate analysis. I have accused, not subtly, the proponents
of testing of zealotry and improper use of statistics and data to
support a moral stance. To some degree my bias as a civil
libertarian has affected my evaluation. In the long run, however,
the truth about this conflict will depend upon ideas and data and
not biography. Urine testing is a wrong-headed intervention into
the lives of some by those with power over them. It is not a
search for illness but a search for deviance conducted in an
un-American manner. Drug abuse is a specter of the 1980's
resembling the specter of domestic communism of the 1950's. Under
the guise of helping, the proponents of testing are creating
enormous harm. Urine testing is simply drug abuse abuse. </font></p>

<h1><font size="3">Test Negative A look at the
&quot;evidence&quot; justifying illicit-drug tests</font></h1>

<p><font size="3">SCIENCE and the CITIZEN</font></p>

<p><font size="3">SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN March 1990, p. 18</font></p>

<p><font size="3">John Morgan</font></p>

<p><font size="3">More than eight million working Americans had
their urine tested for illegal drugs in 1989, and as many as 15
million will undergo such testing this year, according to the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The fraction of
companies that subject employees or job applicants to testing has
jumped from 21 percent in 1986 to more than 50 percent last year,
according to the American Management Association. The trend seems
likely to continue: a majority of the respondents to a recent
Gallup poll favored random drug testing of all workers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">What underlies the broad acceptance of a
practice that conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia
has called a &quot;needless indignity?&quot; One factor may be
the alarming statistics cited by testing advocates to demonstrate
the high costs of drug abuse. Examination of some of these claims
suggests that they do not always accurately reflect the research
on which they are based. In fact, some of the data could be used
to &quot;prove&quot; that drug use has negligible or even
beneficial effects. Consider these examples.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Last year President George Bush declared that
&quot;drug abuse among American workers costs businesses anywhere
from $60 billion to $100 billion a year in lost productivity,
absenteeism, drug-related accidents, medical claims and
theft.&quot; Variants of this statistic abound in discussions
about drug abuse and are commonly repeated without qualification
by the media. Yet all such claims derive from a single study, one
that &quot;was based upon assumptions which need additional
validation,&quot; according to an assessment last year by NIDA,
the chief federal agency sponsoring research on substance abuse.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The study grew out of a survey of some 3,700
households by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in 1982. The
RTI group found that the average reported income of households
with at least one person who admitted to having ever used
marijuana daily (20 days or more in a 30-day period) was 28
percent lower than the average reported income of otherwise
similar households. The RTI researchers defined that difference
in income as &quot;loss due to marijuana use&quot;; the total
loss, when extrapolated to the general population, came to $26
billion. The researchers then added on the estimated costs of
drug-related crime, health problems and accidents to arrive at a
grand total of $47 billion for &quot;costs to society of drug
abuse.&quot; This figure-- &quot;adjusted&quot; to account for
inflation and population increase -- represents the basis of
Bush's statement, according to Henrick J. Harwood, who headed the
RTI study and is now in the White House drug-policy office.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The RTI survey included questions on current
drug use (at least once within the past month). Yet according to
Harwood there was no significant difference between the income of
households with current users of any illegal drug -- including
marijuana, cocaine and heroin -- and the income of otherwise
similar households. Does this mean that current use of even hard
drugs -- as opposed to perhaps a single marijuana binge in the
distant past -- does not lead to any &quot;loss&quot;? &quot;You
would be on safe ground saying that,&quot; Harwood replies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Officials of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have
testified before Congress and at national conferences on drug
abuse that employees who use drugs are &quot;3.6 times more
likely to injure themselves or another person in a workplace
accident....[and] five times more likely to file a workers'
compensation claim.&quot; The pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-La
Roche, which is leading an antidrug campaign among businesses
(and has a big share of the drug-testing market), also
promulgates this claim in &quot;educational&quot; literature.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In fact, the study on which the claim is based
has &quot;nothing to do with [illegal] drug users,&quot;
according to a 1988 article in the University of Kansas Law
Review by John P. Morgan of the City University of New York
Medical School. Morgan, an authority on drug testing, has traced
the Chamber of Commerce claim to an informal study by the
Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of employees undergoing
treatment for alcholism.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In an interview with SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, J.
Michael Walsh, who heads NIDA's applied research division and is
a strong supporter of workplace testing, singled out two studies
that he said showed drug users are more likely to cause
accidents, miss work and use health benefits. The studies were
done at two utilities: the Utah Power and Light Company and the
Georgia Power Company. The 12 workers in Utah and the 116 in
Georgia who served as the primary research subjects were tested
&quot;for cause&quot;: they had either been involved in
accidents, exhibited other &quot;problem&quot; behavior
(commonly, high absenteeism) or submitted to treatment for
alcoholism or drug abuse. Critics point out that it should not be
terribly surprising if these subjects exhibited the cited traits
at a higher-than-average rate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">What may be surprising is that, according to a
report published by NIDA last year, Utah Power and Light actually
&quot;spent $215 per employee per year less on the drug abusers
in health insurance benefits than on the control group.&quot;
Those who tested positive at Georgia Power had a higher promotion
rate than the company average. Moreover, Georgia workers testing
positive only for marijuana (about 35 percent of all the
positives) exhibited absenteeism some 30 percent lower than
average. Nationwide, Morgan says, marijuana accounts for up to 90
percent of all positive findings, both because it is by far the
most widely used illegal drug and because it persists in urine
for up to a month (compared with two days for most other drugs).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Perhaps the study most publicized of late by
testing proponents involves employees of the U.S. Postal Service.
The service tested 4,396 new hirees in 1987 and 1988 and --
keeping the test results confidential -- tracked the performance
of positives (9 percent of the total) and negatives. By last
September, the service reported, 15.4 percent of the positives
and 10.5 of the negatives had been fired: the positives had also
taken an average of six more sick days a year.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This study may be distorted by more subtle
biases --related to race, age or gender --than those displayed by
the utility studies, according to Theodore H. Rosen, a
psychologist and a consultant on drug testing. Indeed, Jacques L.
Normand, who headed the study, acknowledges that minority postal
workers tested positive at a much higher rate than nonminority
workers and that previous studies have shown minorities to have
higher absenteeism.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Morgan points out, moreover, that the Postal
Service study (like all those cited above) has not been published
in a peer-reviewed journal. In fact, he says, only one study
comparing the work of drug-test positives and negatives has
passed peer review. Last year, in the JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL
MEDICINE, David C. Parish of the Mercer University School of
Medicine in Georgia reported on a study of 180 hospital
employees, 22 of whom had tested positive after being hired.
Parish examined supervisor evaluations and other indexes and
found &quot;no difference between drug-positive and drug-negative
employees&quot; at the end of one year. He noted, however, that
11 of the negatives had been fired during that period and none of
the positives.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Proponents of testing often imply that drug use
among workers is growing. A Hoffman-La Roche brochure, for
example, quotes Walsh pronouncing that &quot;the problem of drug
abuse has become so widespread in America that every company must
assume that its employees will eventually be faced with a
substance abuse problem.&quot; Yet in 1989 NIDA reported that
illegal drug use has been decreasing for 10 years and that the
decline has accelerated over the last five years. From 1985 to
1988 the number of current users (at least once in the last
month) of marijuana and cocaine dropped by 33 and 50 percent,
respectively.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To be sure, a subset of this group of current
users is increasing: NIDA estimated that from 1985 to 1988 the
number of people using cocaine at least once a week rose from
647,000 to 862,000 and daily users increased from 246,000 to
292,000. NIDA found that addiction to cocaine (including
&quot;crack&quot;) is particularly severe among the unemployed --
who are beyond the reach of workplace testing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Clearly, the U.S. has a drug-abuse problem.
Could it be that neither indiscriminate testing of workers --
which could cost upward of $500 million this year -- nor the
dissemination of alarmist information by testing advocates is
helping to resolve that problem? </font></p>

<h1><font size="3">FED PANEL SAYS VALUE OF WORKPLACE DRUG TESTING
UNPROVEN</font></h1>

<p><font size="3">Forensic Drug Abuse Advisor Vo. 7 (1) January
1995, p.6</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Subcommittees of the National Research Council
and the Institute of Medicine have completed a study assessing
the extent of drug use in the workplace, and the impact of drug
abuse on job performance. Drug testers may be a little upset by
some of its conclusions, since the study raises important
questions about the scientific rationale for workplace drug
testing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Workplace drug testing is a very big business.
The study group estimates that the United States is spending at
least 1.2 billion dollars per year on drug testing (24 million
tests per year at an estimated total cost of $50 each), not
counting any money spent on time lost from work attributable to
the testing process. Statistical evidence from a variety of
sources suggest that, except for alcohol, drug use in the
workplace has been steadily decreasing for the last 15 years (the
percentage of heavy drinkers in the population appears to be
unchanged). In 1990, the overall rate for workers admitting to
having used an illicit drug some time during the preceding month
was 7%. However, today in some areas, such as the air transport
and nuclear industry, the rate is well below 1%.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">No study has ever demonstrated that this
decrease is due to the work testing program, nor has it been
demonstrated with any certainty that, in commonly used doses, any
of the widely abused drugs significantly impacts on job
performance. There is, however, good evidence that drug users are
more likely to be absent from work, and there is also good
evidence that alcohol abuse is associated with increased
occupational injuries.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The committee felt that much of the data
reviewed for its report was flawed, or at least of dubious
statistical power, and they concluded that &quot;the preventive
effects of drug-testing programs have never been adequately
demonstrated.&quot; As Craig Zwerling pointed out in a recent
issue of JAMA, Journal of the American Medical Association (272
[18] 1467-1468), the conclusion reached by the study group was
the same as that reached in a 1992 study, namely that there was
&quot;almost no credible warrant of effectiveness.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Zwerling also went on to note that &quot;a
large industry of drug testers has arisen with a financial stake
in expanding the market for workplace drug tests. The industry
includes the companies that manufacture the equipment and
chemicals used in drug testing, the laboratories that carry out
the test, the companies that collect the urine specimens, the
medical review officers (MRO's) who review the test results, and
the consultants who advise companies on drug testing.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The study was sponsored by NIDA (National
Institute on Drug Abuse) and the results have been published in
book form by the National Academy Press. The full title is
&quot;Under the Influence? Drugs and the American Work
Force,&quot; Normand, J, Lempert, R, and O'Brien, C eds.
(Committee on Drug Use in the Workplace, National Research
Council / Institute of Medicine). 321 pp $39.95, ISBN
0-309-04885-0</font></p>

<p><font size="3">COMMENT: This book should be required reading.
Somebody has to do the studies to prove that the whole process
works. But who is going to put up the money to do the studies?
NIDA has just as big a vested interest in maintaining the status
quo as the drug testing companies, and the reagent manufacturers.
In fact, it may be too late to ever do the studies that would
justify the money and effort being spent on these programs. </font></p>

<h1><font size="3">THE DRUG - TEST SCAM</font></h1>

<p><font size="3">by Ian Williams Goddard</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Alas, the sorry sound of a Big Lie crashing: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The stereotype of the lazy, illicit-drug using
bum promotes an acceptance of claims that il- licit drug use
imposes heavy economic burdens upon businesses and society, and
consequently that universal drug testing is the most cost-
effective reaction to this unprofitable burden. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">But how true are these claims, which seem to
enjoy the support of reputable scientific re- search?Under
examination these claims are proven to be nothing more than a
greedy scam designed to expand the bureaucratic empires and
profits of a few by sacrificing the most fundamental liberties of
the many.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">ILLICIT DRUG USERS WORK MORE</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Contradicting the &quot;unproductive drug
user&quot; stereotype, while the National Household Sur- vey on
Drug Abuse [1] finds that 71% of il- licit-drug users are
employed, U.S. Depart- ment of Labor statistics [2] show that
only 65% of those 20 and over are employed. From the data we can
extrapolate that the aver- age illicit-drug user is more likely
to be employed than the average person [3].</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The evidence suggests that, while not favor-
able to police-state mega profits, the most true-to-life
stereotype could be: &quot;The pro- ductive and motivated drug
user.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Why might this be so? It's possible that the
desire for the reward of drug intoxication acts as astronger
incentive to work more (in an effort to earn the money necessary
to purchase the drug-reward) than non-drug rewards act as an
incentive for nonusers to work more. Such is Economics 101: the
higher the reward, the higher the output to acquire it; or, the
sweeter the carrot on the stick, the faster the horse will run
after it. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">ILLICIT DRUG USERS COST LESS &amp; WORK HARDER</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The journal SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN [4] cited a
study of workers at two utility companies: Utah Power &amp; Light
and Georgia Power Company. The workers who tested positive for
illicit drugs were found to (a) cost employers $215 less per
worker per year in health insurance, and (b) have a higher rate
of promotion. Work- ers testing positive for cannabis only had an
absentee rate 30% lower than average. The logical conclusion:
illicit users were less costly to employers while at the same
time being more productive and reliable. More for less! -- now
there's a deal.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE [5]
published a study that found &quot;no difference between
drug-positive and drug-negative em- ployees.&quot;However, the
study's author ob- served that during the study, 11 of the non-
users were fired while none of the users were fired. Ironically,
once the study end- ed, all of the users could have been fired
for using the &quot;wrong&quot; drugs, regardless of their
productivity and professionalism.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The claim that illicit-drug use costs busi-
nesses X billion dollars per year, is der- ived from a 1982 study
by the Research Tri- angle Institute. The study found that house-
holds with at least one member who used can- nabis daily at some
point in their life had a 28% lower income than the average
house- hold income. Yet the study also showed that those
currently using any illicit drug had an income equivalent to the
average [4]. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">If we conclude that because cannabis use pre-
ceded a lower income, therefore, cannabis use caused a lower
income(a post hoc ergo prop- ter hoc fallacy), then we must also
conclude based on the data that if you used cannabis in the past,
you should start using it again to increase your income to
current-user rates. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Interesting to note:if current drug users earn
more than former users, this supports the theory that drug
rewards are a more powerful incentive for work than nondrug
rewards.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">THE RIGGING OF RESEARCH</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In an effort to push Congress to pass manda-
tory illicit-drug-testing legislation, U.S. Chamber of Commerce
officials, in testimony before Congress, claimed that research
showed illicit-drug users were &quot;3.6 times more like- ly to
injure themselves or another person in a workplace
accident...[and] five times more likely to file a workers'
compensation claim.&quot; However, as SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN [4]
observed:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In fact, the study on which the claim is based
has &quot;nothing to do with [illicit] drug users,&quot;
according to a 1988 article in the University of Kansas Law Re-
view by John P. Morgan of the City University of New York Med-
ical School. Morgan, an author- ity on drug testing, has traced
the Chamber of Commerce claim to an informal study by the Fire-
stone Tire and Rubber Company of employees undergoing treatment
for alcoholism. ^^^^^^^^^^ Using the devastating effects of the
govern- ment subsidized drug alcohol to initiate a leg- islative
pogrom against safer, albeit, illicit drugs -- an obvious and
shameless scam. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">This scam is promoted not only by governmental
interests in an effort to expand bureaucratic empires,but also by
private interests in an effort to maximize profits, as the
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN observed: &quot;The pharmaceutical giant
Hoffman-La Roche, which is leading an anti- drug campaign among
businesses (and has a big share of the drug-testing market), also
promul- gates this claim in 'educational' literature.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN observed other errors in
the research promoted by the GovtMedia that purports to show that
drug users are bad for business. For example, a study that found
a higher absentee rate among users failed to note that most users
in the study were minor- ities, and minorities have an absentee
rate, regardless of drug use, identical to the rate observed in
the study.Logic therefore dic- tates, contrary to the GovtMedia's
conclusion, that NO statistically significant correlation between
drug use and absenteeism was found.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">CONCLUSIONARY OVERVIEW</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ultimately, the drug-testing and drug-rehab-
ilitation program is a massive cannabis-user- identification and
reeducation pogrom. This is because 90% of drug-positive urine
tests are for cannabis, which is due to the fact that inactive
metabolites of THC remain in the urine for up to 30 days after a
single use, whereas most other drugs are out of the system in a
day or even less. But why sacri- fice primary liberties for
cannabis control?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Not only is cannabis one of the safest known
drugs [6], and, as we have just observed, is correlated to better
employee performance, but there is no established correlation
bet- ween cannabis and motor-skill impairment; thus, unlike legal
alcohol, it cannot even be said to impair driving skills, which
is a major drug testing pretext. Observing the safety of cannabis
use, the National High- way Traffic Safety Administration [7]
said:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">No clear relationship has ever been
demonstrated between mari- juana smoking and either serious- ly
impaired driving performance or the risk of accident involve-
ment... [T]here is little if any evidence to indicate that
drivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely to
cause serious accidents than drug free drivers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The most exhaustive review of the research
clearly confirms that there is simply no compelling case for the
intrusive Orwellian surveillance of private activity that is im-
posed by drug testing.As Dr. John Morgan, director of
pharmacology at City University of New York Medical School,
wisely observed: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Urine testing is ... a method for surveillance,
not a tool for safety.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Indeed, drug testing is not about safety or job
performance; drug testing is a necessary feature of the
Surveillance State that is now being built around us to ensure
total cradle- to-grave surveillance and control of workers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">While it's been said that those who are will-
ing to give up liberty for safety will soon have neither,in the
case of illicit-drug testing -- which cannot even promise improv-
ed safety -- we can say that those who are willing to give up
liberty for nothing will soon have only that for which they
surrend- ered their priceless liberty: nothing. </font></p>

this give the illicit users an unfair advantage in this analysis?
No, because the EPR for ages 18-19 is roughly 1 to 3% lower than
for ages 20 and above (likely due to being in school);this lower
rate of employment for ages 18-19 would serve only to lower the
il- licit-user EPR results.Therefore, the inclu- sion of ages

<p><font size="4">URINALYSIS OR UROMANCY? THE UNTOLD COSTS OF
DRUG TESTING ABUSE</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dale Gieringer, Ph.D.,</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A paper for the Drug Policy Foundation
Published in &quot;Strategies for Change: New Directions in Drug
Policy (1992)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Among the impositions on personal privacy
introduced in the Reagan-Bush era, few are more intrusive but
less questioned than drug urinalysis. Relatively unknown at the
start of the eighties, urinalysis has now become a condition for
employment in over half of America's major companies, as well as
for insurance, child custody, security clearance, and freedom
from jail on probation or parole. While urinalysis has been
challenged by civil libertarians, courts have generally upheld it
in the face of strong public support. Opponents have objected
that drug testing is an unwarranted violation of privacy and a
search without probable cause, bu supporters have successfully
countered that the supposed hazards of drug abuse necessitate
urine testing. What is all too rarely challenged in this debate
is the scientific rationale of urinalysis as a means of detecting
drug abuse in the first place. The facts that urinalysis does not
detect whether someone is impaired or under the influence of
drugs; rather it detects the presence of non-psychoactive drug
metabolites that may linger in the system days or weeks after
use. In this respect urinalysis differs from the familiar alcohol
breathalyzer and blood tests, which detect whether one is
actually under the influence (as it turns out, alcohol is unique
in this regard: for other drugs, there is no simple relation
between impairment and concentration in bodily fluids). Thus it
is not only possible, but entirely likely that someone whose
urine tests positive for drugs is altogether competent and
unimpaired. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">As it happens, urinalysis is particularly
sensitive to marijuana, a single use of which can register
positive for as long as a week, long after any effects have
vanished; heavy users may register positive for as long as 4-6
weeks. Thus, urinalysis precludes even the most innocent, weekend
smoking of marijuana as &quot;drug abuse.&quot; Ironically,
urinalysis is considerably more tolerant of harder drugs such as
cocaine and heroin, which generally wash out in 2-3 days at most.
Other commonly used psychoactive drugs, including nicotine,
tranquilizers, and psychedelic drugs such as LSD are generally
not tested for.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Above all, urinalysis doesn't detect America's
number one drug of abuse, alcohol. Thus urinalysis in no way
assures a drug-free workplace. Instead, it encourages
substitution of alcohol and other non-tested drugs for marijuana,
cocaine, opiates and amphetamine.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Drug urinalysis is therefore an inherently
flawed technology. On one hand, it arbitrarily treats even the
most occasional marijuana users as &quot;drug abuse,&quot;
despite the substantial evidence that moderate marijuana use is
harmless. On the other hand, it ignores flagrant alcoholism. The
upshot is that urinalysis disqualifies many productive, competent
workers who enjoy non-traditional drugs in their free time, while
completely ignoring the majority of drug abusers, who are
alcoholics. All of this raises obvious questions about the value
of drug urinalylsis.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Morally, urinalysis can be compared to randomly
searching workers' homes and garbage cans and branding them
alcohol abusers if empty liquor bottles are found. Though it
might seem that Americans would strenuously object to such
warrantless searches of their homes, polls have shown strong
public support for searching their bladder contents, especially
in jobs deemed safety-critical.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">URINALYSIS: AN UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGY</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Despite the public support for drug testing,
urinalysis is a remarkably unproven technology. Were urinalysis a
life-saving new drug, it would have had to undergo years of
painstaking premarket testing in order to meet FDA regulations,
requiring it to be proven fully &quot;safe and effective&quot; in
rigorous, double-blind studies. Yet the fact is that urinalysis
has been imposed on millions of American workers involuntarily
without so much as a single scientifically controlled study to
show that it is a safe or effective means of promoting workplace
safety. Moreover, unlike drug consumers, urinalysis subjects
receive no warning labels informing them of what they are being
tested for, nor of the risks, accepted usage or implications of
the tests.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A close inspection of the evidence for drug
testing shows that it rests largely on exaggerated, distorted and
unfounded claims, as shown in critical reviews in Scientific
American and elsewhere. (1) For instance, testing advocates have
cited a Research Triangle Institute survey purporting to show
that the income loss due to marijuana use was some $26 billion;
yet the same data showed no difference at all in income between
non-users and current users of marijuana or other drugs. Other,
non-peer-reviewed studies by employers have likewise been
misinterpreted to support urinalysis: for instance, a pair of
studies at Utah Power and Light Co. and Georgia Power Co.
purporting to show that drug users pose a high risk of accidents
and absenteeism only looked at users who had exhibited problem
behavior on lthe job. Not surprisingly, this population had worse
than average work records. Nonetheless, Utah Power found thalt
drug users cost $215 less in health insurance benefits, while
Georgia Power found lower rates of absenteeism in workers who
tested positive only for marijuana!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only a handful of published studies have
compared the performance of drug-positive workers with others,
with similar, mixed results. A one-year follow-up study of 180
new employeees at a Georgia hospital found no relationship
between drug screen results and subsequent job performance. It
concluded, &quot;The data presently available do not support the
thesis that positive drug screening predicts poor job
performance.&quot; (2) Nonetheless, the U.S. government has
recently ordered random testing of its VA hospital employees. The
most extensive and widely cited research on workplace drug
testing comes from the U.S. Postal Service, which tracked the job
performance of new employees according to prior drug screen
results. Test results were not used in hiring decisions, but were
evaluated to determine their relation to job performance one year
later. The first study, which tracked the performance of 2533
postal workers in Boston, reported that drug-positive workers had
a statistically 50% higher rate of dismissals, reprimands,
injuries, accidents and absenteeism. (3) However, the authors
noted that this difference was &quot;much less than previously
estimated.&quot; Looked at another way, the Boston data actually
showed that the great majority of drug-positive users were
reliable: fully 86% of marijuana-positive workers were
discipline-free after one year, versus 91% for non-users; 74%
were accident-free, versus 81% for non-users; and 71% were still
on the job, versus 81% for non-users. Thus, on the average,
marijuana-positive workers were 90% as reliable as clean-urine
ones. Surprisingly, cocaine-positive workers fared even better,
being over 95% as reliable in most categories. The Boston
findings regarding accidents and injuries were subsequently
contradicted by a second, larger, study of 4,396 postal workers
nationwide, which found no relation at all between drug test
results and injuries or accidents. (4) The Boston accident
findings had previously been criticized on methodological
grounds. The second Postal Service study did find that those who
tested positive for illicit drugs had a 50% higher rate of
absenteeism and dismissals. Yet once again, they showed that
drug-using workers were largely reliable: drug users had a 93.4%
attendance record, versus 95.8% for others, and 85% of users kept
their jobs, versus 89.5% of non-users.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Boston data were later analyzed in a
cost-benefit study, which found that drug screening would be
marginally economical, to the tune of about $162 per
drug-positive worker rejected. (5) However, the authors cautioned
that these results were highly sensitive to variations in the
extent of drug use and cost of urine testing, and that there were
likely to be many situations where drug testing was not
cost-effective. They concluded that companies &quot;should
carefully weigh the costs and benefits&quot; in their particular
industry. Had the authors examined the second Post Service study,
they would presumably have found even slimmer benefits from urine
testing, since there would have been no savings from accidents or
injuries. Furthermore, their analysis undoubtedly overstated the
potential value of drug urine testing, since they assumed that
all drug-positive workers would be screened out. In practice,
however, drug-using workers are apt to avoid detection, either by
discontinuing use temporarily beforehand or by other evasion
techniques described below. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">VICTIMS OF URINALYSIS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">While the benefits of drug testing to employers
appear dubious and unproven, the costs to the workforce have
scarcely been examined at all. Nonetheless, it is clear that
urinalysis imposes significant costs on workers. To begin with,
it forces millions of innocent employees to submit to scrutiny of
intimate bodily fluids in a way that many regard as degrading and
obnoxious. This is especially trying for the unfortunate minority
sufering &quot;blushing kidneys,&quot; who are unable to produce
urine on demand. At least one urinalysis victim has even been
hospitalized for water poisoning after being required to drink
three liters of water in order to make her give urine. (6)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Urinalysis is especially burdensome and
offensive to those otherwise responsible, productive workers who
do not abuse drugs on the job but enjoy indulging them in their
free time at home. Principal among these are the nation's 20 or
30 million marijuana users, the great majority of whom are
occasional users. (7) Due to the oversensitivity of urine tests
to marijuana, pot smokers constitute the great majority of
urinalysis victims: up to 90% of drug-positive test results are
for marijuana. (8) Urinalysis forces these workers either to give
up a valued pleasure, or to risk losing employment, insurance, or
other benefits and rights.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">California NORML (National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws) is one of several organizations
offering drug testing advice via a telephone hotline, over which
we have received scores of complaints from victims of drug
testing abuse. Included are truck drivers, airline attendants,
office workers, mechanics, nurses and other employees with
impeccable work records, who have lost long-held jobs on account
of their urine chemistry, often against the wishes of their own
supervisors and co-workers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One urinalysis victim, Mike Beatty, says he
lost $500,000 in Air Force retirement benefits after discharged
for using marijuana solely on the evidence of one bad urine test.
Beatty says that he used to smoke pot regularly, but like most
fellow servicemen gave it up when urine testing was instituted.
Nonetheless, he relates, he continued to socialize with pot
smokers, and had the misfortune of accidentally consuming a
marijuana brownie at a party shortly before a drug test. Beatty
says that before his discharge he was &quot;humiliated&quot; by
Air Force personnel with sexual aspersions and investigations
into his wife's private sex life.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another urinalysis victim named Don was fired
from an ARCO truck driving job after 19 years on the job.
&quot;It didn't even occur to me that I had a problem.&quot; he
said. &quot;I thought they were looking for coke.&quot; Don, who
had an excellent work record and seniority, complains that ARCO
never explained the implications of its drug testing policy.
After losing his job and pension benefits, he was forced to sell
his house and settlle for a much lower-paying job. &quot;You can
count me as a victim of drug testing,&quot; he says.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Jim is outstanding at what he does,&quot;
reads the employee evaluation file of another urinalysis victim,
a tractor trailer driver who was fired under Department of
Transportation drug testing regulations. &quot;Excellent safe
driving awareness,&quot; &quot;great initiative,&quot;
&quot;demonstrated dedication and consistency,&quot; read other
testimonials in Jim's file. Jim, who admits t being a weekend
marijuana smoker, was fired after five lyears on the job despite
having the highest possible job safety rating with his company.
&quot;My employer couldn't believe it,&quot; says another woman
who was fired from a job with a major retail store after failing
a surprise drug test. Like many other drug testing victims, the
woman was tested after being &quot;promoted&quot; to a higher
position.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Drug testing has destroyed my attitude
towards my job and my government,&quot; says another utility
worker, who was forced into an &quot;employee assistance
program&quot; for a positive urine test. &quot;They treat me like
a drug addict,&quot; he says, echoing the complaint of many pot
smokers, &quot;and they go home and get drunk every night.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">DEALING WITH DRUG TESTS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The most common question received on the
California NORML hotline is how to deal with a urine test for
marijuana. The most obvious advice is to abstain from suspect
substances before the test. Many callers are surprised to learn
that occasional, weekend use typically washes out in as few as
2-5 days. Most regular smokers commonly pass within a couple of
weeks, though very heavy use can be detected for as long as six
weeks. However, exceptions can occur. NORML has heard from
callers who have reported flunking as long as 10 days after a
single, isolated use, while other, regular smokers have been
known to pass within hours of last use. Such reports only
emphasize the essential capriciousness and unreliability of drug
urinalysis.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For pot smokers facing drug tests on short
notice, the simplest and most effective advice is to drink large
volumes of liquids immediately before the test. The purpose of
this is to dilute the concentration of drug metabolites in the
urine below the threshold of detection (usually 100 nanograms per
milliliter for the commonly used EMIT test). Test subjects are
also advised to avoid giving urine that has accumulated in the
bladder overnight, since this tends to be high in metabolites.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Although reliable information on urinalysis
evasion is hard to come by, reports from underground
investigators agree that urine dilution can be quite effective.
Most regular smokers are able to pass within a week or two, and
sometimes much sooner, though exceptions occur. (9) Dilution can
be boosted by taking diuretics, which stimulate urination;
however, the most effective of these are available only on
prescription. A number of diets and wash-out regimes have been
proposed for persons who have several days to prepare; however,
none of these have been scientifically validated. It is possible
for laboratories to detect dilute urine by special tests for
specific gravity, creatanin content, etc.; however, such tests
are expensive and rarely used. On rare occasion, subjects are
asked to take a second test after submitting a sample that has
been found to be too watery. Of course, this gives them more time
to clear up.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Becuase urine dilution is far from 100%
reliable, especially for regular users caught unawares, there is
a natural demand for surer methods. Many users experiment with
oral &quot;drug screens&quot; that are rumored to avert positive
urine tests. Included are certain vitamins, vinegar, zinc
sulfate, and goldenseal root, as well as some overpriced special
formulas and herb teas sold on the underground market. Despite
glowing testimonials from some lucky users, these nostrums have
no good scientific foundation and have been found to be
unreliable in underground investigations.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A more reliable, if ethically dubious, way to
foil urine tests is to furtively tamper with the sample. One
popular trick is to adulterate the sample with one of a number of
household products that are known to interfere with the common
EMIT test so as to produce a false negative for marijuana. (10)
Popular adulterants include detergent, salt, bleach and Drano
crystals, which can be concealed under the fingernails. However,
such substances may be detectable by sight or smell by diligent
lab technicians. A more sophisticated, less easily detected
adulterant is currently sold on lthe underground market. (11) and
has been proven to be quite reliable at producing false negatives
for marijuana (the manufacturer was compelled to move operations
when the Texas legislature passed a bill outlawing sale of urine
adulterants) (12)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another, more cumbersome trick is to substitute
clean urine for one's own when delivering the sample. A
surprising number of American workers appear to have rigged
themselves up with substitute urine samples by methods elaborated
in Abby Hoffman's book, &quot;Steal This Urine Test.&quot; (13)
In order to discourage such cheating, many labs now measure the
temperature of each sample.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another, surer safeguard against tampering is
to require that subjects be carefully observed during urination.
However, aside from the armed forces and criminal justice system,
few testers resort to such extreme measures. Most tests
accordingly provide leeway for evasive sleights of hand. One
regrettable side-effect of drug testing is thus to favor those
more unscrupulous drug users who are willing to resort to
tampering and similar evasion techniques, whereas honest users
must either give up or face the risk of being fired. In a similar
way, dishonesty is favored on questionnaires asking about illicit
drug use: those drug users who are honest about their use are
routinely turned down, with the result that only dishonest users
are hired.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">PRE-EMPLOYMENT TESTS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In general, the common pre-employment urine
screen is by far the easiest kind of test to deal with, insofar
as prospective employees need only avoid incriminating substances
for the time they are on the job market. However, a surprising
number of ignorant job applicants are unaware that they should be
prepared for urine tests in the first place. Most pot smokers
appear to have little problem abstaining for job tests, given the
low addictiveness of marijuana. Only rarely has California NORML
encountered long-term heavy users who complain of difficulty in
giving up pot for a while.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Nonetheless, pre-employment tests can still be
a problem even for moderate users if they happen to encounter a
surprise job opportunity. In addition, many companies require
drug screens of employees when they are promoted. As a result,
many workers whose efforts have won them a promotion end up being
fired instead on account of bad urine chemistry. Employees may
also face urine tests unexpectedly when their company is sold to
new management. In such cases, the new owners may demand a sudden
spot urine check of the entire workforce, effectively purging it
of anyone who has had the bad luck to indulge a suspect substance
too recently. Victims of such abuses generally have no legal
recourse against dismissal, and can also expect to lose
unemployment benefits.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">NORML has heard from many otherwise blameless
pot smokers who have lost jobs thanks to drug testing. Few cases
better illustrate the absurd lengths to which urinalysis is
carried than that of a newly &quot;promoted&quot; radio
programmer who found himself fired for a positive marijuana test.
The employee, who admitted to being a weekend pot smoker, had
been working for a San Francisco &quot;60's golden oldies&quot;
FM station!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Many NORML callers complain of having been
coerced into drug testing programs they don't understand or
approve of, with little explanation of how the policy will be
administered. &quot;It was very manipulative,&quot; recounts one
woman concerning her employer's efforts to make her sign a form
consenting to urinalysis. &quot;They told us of course we
wouldn't be randomly tested; we would only be tested on
cause,&quot; she relates, &quot;But the form specifically stated
we would agree to random testing.&quot; Many employees receive no
disclosure statements at all, leaving them vulnerable to
arbitrary decisions. Some workers complain of being fired for a
single bad test, after being given the impression that they would
be eligible for a rehabilitation program instead. Many employees
complain about being &quot;singled out&quot; for drug tests
because they are unpopular with their supervisor or manager.
Others report being told by their managers that they will be
protected from urine tests because they are valued employees.
Some employees receive advance warning about impending tests,
giving them time to prepare; others are taken by surprise.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Because blood and urine samples are used for
many other medical tests, subjects do not necessarily know when
they are being drug tested. A Nevada mother told the NORML
hotline that she had been unwittingly blood-tested for marijuana
in a maternity ward, in what she had been told was a blood test
for AIDS. She said her family was subsequently visited by
plainclothes police demanding that they refer their newborn to a
hospital ward for drug-addicted babies, or else give up custody.
Another woman relates giving a urine specimen for what she was
told was a pre-employment drug test, and losing the job when the
employer inspected it to find out that whe was pregnant instead!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(Continued)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">URINALYSIS OR UROMANCY PART II</font></p>

<p><font size="3">RANDOM URINALYSIS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">By far the most dreaded and intrusive form of
drug testing is the random test, which is specifically designed
to take workers by surprise. Under random testing, workers may be
called on to provide a urine sample at any time, typically on no
more than an hour or two's notice (however, in some shops,
workers have been known to receive as much as a weeks' advance
alert). A corollary of random urinalysis is to prevent workers
from using any marijuana, even at home on weekends, at the risk
of losing their jobs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">While private employers have tended to shy wawy
from random testing on grounds of expense, government drug
warriors have successfully campaigned to impose random testing
through federal regulations. Random urinalysis is now required
for the military, many public employees and contractors, and the
nation's entire interstate transportation workforce -- including
not only airline pilots, train engineers and truck drivers, but
also flight attendants, mechanics, and gas pipeline workers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The NORML hotline receives many complaints
about random testing from transportation workers. Most not only
resent the intrusion on their private lives, but also insist that
illicit drug abuse is not a safety problem. &quot;Alcohol is the
worst abused drug, especially pilots,&quot; says one angry flight
attendant, a view repeatedly expressed by others in the industry.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">According to air industry spokesmen, not a
single passenger airline crash had been attributed to alcohol or
drug abuse. (14) Administration officials lamely pointed to a
1988 plane crash in Durango, Colorado, in which the pilot's blood
showed evidence of cocaine use. Yet investigators determined that
the pilot was not high at the time of the crash, and it was the
co-pilot who was controlling the plane at the time of the crash!
(15) The fact that drug testing is widely opposed by the very
airline workers whose lives are most at stake would seem to raise
obvious questions about the supposed dangers of drug abuse in the
air industry.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Drug testing of transportation workers was
mandated by Congress in response to a highly publicized 1987
train collision in which 16 passengers were killed. (16) The
accident was blamed on the negligence of an engineer and
brakeman, who were determined to have been smoking marijuana
shortly before the crash. A subsequent investigation revealed
that both men had an extensive record of drunken driving offenses
and were known to be problem drinkers. Furthermore, some of the
train's safety equipment had been disabled. The engineer admitted
to culpability for ignoring warning signals, but denied that
marijuana had anything to do with the accident. An investigation
by the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the
railroad should undertake management reforms and equipment
improvements, but did not recommend drug testing. Nonetheless,
Transportation Secretary James Burnley argued for drug testing,
pointing to evidence that a significant percentage of
accident-involved rail personnel tested positive for drugs. (17)
In fact, however, Federal Railroad Administration statistics
showed that only 4-6% of &quot;reasonable cause&quot; urine tests
were positive for drugs or alcohol, (18) half of what might have
been expected for a normal cross-section of the workforce! (19)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The ultimate impact of random testing
regulations remains to be seen, as testing is still being phased
in within the transportation industry. Many workers have
responded by adjusting their drug use, however grudgingly. Others
persist in risking a urine positive, relying on one or another
evasion techniques to minimize their risks. Relatively few are
actually caught: airlines report fewer than 1% of employees test
urine positive. (20) Included are an unfortunate number of very
occasional users: NORML has heard from more than one flight
attendant dismissed for indulging a rare joint with an old
friend.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Many workers report turning to alcohol as a
substitute for marijuana. &quot;I'm drinking a lot more
now,&quot; says one trucker, echoing a common complaint of many
drug-tested workers who say they use pot to control alcoholism.
Other drug-tested workers report widespread alcohol abuse among
their fellows: &quot;You see guys stumbling in here drunk from
the management on down,&quot; says a Customs employee,
&quot;There are guys drinking alcohol first thing in the
morning.&quot; Another employee told NORML that workers at his
job had started smoking heroin instead of pot. Meanwhile, in the
military, LSD is said to have become the illicit drug of choice
due to its relative undetectability. (21) It is tempting to
speculated that recent reports of a parallel upsurge in alcohol
and LSD use among young persons reflect a broader social trend
created by the incentives of drug urinalysis. (22)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">URINALYSIS: &quot;ON-CAUSE&quot; OR NO CAUSE?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In many workplaces, employees are subject to
&quot;on-cause&quot; testing whenever they have an accident.
While such testing might seem unobjectionable, it is often abused
so as to inculpate innocent workers. For instance, a diesel
mechanic told NORML that he had been ordered to take a urine test
following a minor workplace accident on a Friday, and that his
drug test was scheduled for Monday, three days after the
accident. The worker was rightly concerned that he might be fired
because he had recently smoked marijuana at home. Ironically,
however, three days would have been ample time to pass the test
had he actually been under the influence of any other
drug--cocaine, heroin, alcohol or speed--at the time of the
accident!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In another case, a woman reported that her
husband, a print shop worker with eight years' seniority, had
flunked a drug test for marijuana after receiving a minor finger
cut in an accident caused by another worker. Not only was her
husband fired for an accident that wasn't his fault, but the
family also lost health insurance coverage for their son, who had
serious medical problems costing $1200 per month. Like other
urine testing victims, the woman charged that the company had
financial motivations to fire her husband, namely the family's
insurance costs. Urinalysis abuse is a phenomenon that extends
beyond the job market. For instance, some insurance companies
require drug urinalysis as part of their physical exams.
Applicants are routinely denied insurance if they are found to
use marijuana, despite the fact that there is not an iota of
actuarial evidence showing marijuana adversely affects life
expectancy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Urinalysis has also come to figure in custody
battles between estranged couples. One husband told California
NORML that he had been directed by a court to submit to
urinalysis after his wife had accused him of being a marijuana
smoker, a condition widely presumed to compromise parental
fitness. He complained that he was given no time to prepare for
the test, despite the fact that his wife, who had demanded the
test, had three weeks to prepare a clean sample of her own.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another arena where urinalysis is widely abused
is the prison system, where it is often imposed indiscriminately
as a condition of probation or parole. As a result, many
non-violent offenders face substantial prison time for simply
smoking a joint. For instance, a California woman with a long
history of medical marijuana use for migraines was sentenced to 8
months in jail on charges of marijuana transportation. The judge
explained that he could not give her a suspended sentence because
in that case she would be subject to drug testing, which she
would almost certainly fail, thereby ending up with a substantial
sentence. Drug use violations have been reported to constitute
45% of all parole violations in California, which in turn account
for nearly half of all prison admissions. (23) The use of
marijuana screening appears especially dubious in light of the
fact that marijuana tends to suppress violence, whereas the
nearest substitute, alcohol, tends to aggravate it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">California NORML has heard from several medical
marijuana patients with drug testing problems. &quot;Pot makes me
feel better,&quot; complains a government worker with psoriatic
arthritis, &quot;I can't take alcohol.&quot; Other patients are
threatened with drug testing programs following convictions for
marijuana offenses. Although marijuana is not an approved
medication, patients may be able to pass urinalysis by obtaining
a prescription for Marinol, the government-approved synthetic
marijuana substitute. Since Marinol reacts exactly like
marijuana, patients could presumably obtain a medical exemption
for a positive urine test. Unfortunately, however, prescriptions
for Marinol are not easy to come by and federal regulations
forbid its use outside of cancer chemotherapy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One common concern about drug testing is the
danger of &quot;false positives,&quot; in which subjects are
erroneously accused of drug use. Contrary to rumor, neither
passive smoking nor drug interactions are likely to cause false
marijuana positives. Only in the most unlikely conditions, such
as sitting for hours on end in a closet full of heavy pot
smokers, has passive smoking been shown to produce a level of
urine metabolites high enough to be detected on the standart EMIT
test. (24) Likewise, no drug is known to cause a false positive
for marijuana, but certain over-the-counter medicines can trigger
the test for amphetamines and poppy seeds can be confused with
opiates (it used to be that ibuprofen interfered somewhat with
marijuana tests, but this problem has been fixed). (25) Such
problems are supposed to be sorted out by medical review
officers, the reliability of whom can only be speculated on.
However, NORML has not heard any complaints about false positives
from drug interactions.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The important question remains whether false
positives may be caused by lab error. Early surveys of drug
testing labs reported remarkably high error rates. However,
industry and government have taken steps to insure against false
positives for the sake of public credibility and liability. By
requiring accurate gas chromatograph confirmation tests of
positive samples and regulating the chain of custody, selected
labs have demonstrated false positive rates as low as zero in
10,000 -- 48,000 samples in proficiency tests (false negatives,
in which drug use is not detected, run around 3%) (26)
Nonetheless, given the profusion of unregulated labs, higher
error rates may well be common. It should be noted that even if
false positives occur in as few as one in 100,000 tests, hundreds
of Americans per year can expect to be falsely branded as illicit
drug users.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">California NORML has heard from three or four
persons claiming to be victims of &quot;false positives&quot; for
marijuana. Claims of this kind are by nature suspicious and
difficult to verify. On one occasion, however, I personally
observed what appeared to be a serious lapse of security in a
local clinic that administers drug tests to probationers for
local corrections authorities. I had come there to have some
experimental specimens tested, and was told to place them on a
shelf. While I waited for an attendant to record and label the
samples, a nurse came in and deposited another unlabeled specimen
jar on the shelf next to mine. Had I not brought the situation to
the attendant's attention, it would have been child's play to
switch and mislabel the samples by error or mischief.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">UROMANCY: AN OBSOLESCENT TECHNOLOGY?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The full toll of drug urine victims has yet to
be scientifically investigated. Nothing is known about the number
of false positives, nor the number of responsible workers
disqualified for urine positives, nor the costs to their
families, the economy, and welfare roles, nor the extent to which
drug urinalysis has aggravated abuse of alcohol, tobacco and
other untested drugs. As for the purported benefits of testing,
these too are unclear. Given the potential for drug substitution,
however, it may be doubted whether they will prove significant.
Indeed, a pair of recent studies suggest that the recent decline
in marijuana use has led to an increase in drug-abuse emergencies
and auto fatalities due to alcohol and other drugs. (27)
Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics lhas reported a jump in
job-related sickness and injuries to a record 6.8 million in
1990, or 8.8 out of 100 workers, the highest rate since 1979,
before drug testing began! All of this raises obvious questions
about the purported benefits of drug urinalysis. Insofar as the
evidence for drug testing rests more on faith than science, it
might aptly be called &quot;uromancy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The case for drug urinalysis is further
undermined by the fact that there exist alternative means for
detecting impairment. Most promising of these are performance
tests, which measure reaction time, alertness, and agility at
various tasks. Computer-based performance tests are now on the
market and have started to be used in some workplaces. (28)
Performance tests have the obvious advantage of measuring actual
impairment, regardless of the cause. Unlike urinalysis, they can
detect problems caused by alcohol and other, untested drugs, as
well as stress, fatigue, and emotional distress. In addition,
they have the important advantage of disregarding private
behavior that is irrelevant to job performance.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another, often ignored alternative to
urinalysis is blood testing. Although blood tests are even more
physically invasive than urine tests, they provide a much better
indication of current impairment, since they detect the active
presence of psychoactive drugs in the system rather than inactive
urinemetabolites. Because blood tests are less sensitive to
behaviorally irrelevant, past drug use than urine tests, they are
commonly used in forensic studies of accident victimes to
determine whether the subject was under the influence of drugs.
Unfortunately, blood tests are at best an imperfect indicator of
intoxication for drugs other than alcohol, and it is impossible
to determine fixed thresholds for impairment. In the case of
marijuana, THC blood levels decline quite rapidly to negligible
levels in as little as two hours for occasional lusers, although
chronic users can manifest detectable levels for a couple of
days. Blood tests may therefore offer a useful way for occasional
drug users to establish their innocence of being under the
influence. The case can be made that any worker accused of
on-the-job drug abuse should have the option of taking a blood or
impairment test to prove his or her competence (in California,
motorists accused of driving under the influence of drugs have
the option of blood or urine tests; unfortunately, few if any
drivers understand the dramatic differences in sensitivit;y
between the two).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another, more sinister alternative to
urinalysis is hair testing, which is even more sensitive to past
drug use than urinalysis. Promoters claim to detect drug use for
months and even years, far longer than any pharmacological impact
on health. Despite the fact that hair testing has unresolved
technical problems and is considered to be an unproven technology
by the scientific community, (29) it is already being marketed
and used by some private employers and has been boosted by
federal officials like Drug Czars William Bennett and Bob
Martinez. The one advantage of hair testing is that is is less
invasive of bodily privacy than blood or urine testing, although
some persons, such as those of the Sikh religion, object to
having their hair disturbed. However, because hair testing is
also much more indiscriminate than other technologies in
distinguishing harmless drug use from abuse, it poses enen
greater potential costs to society, the economy, and civil
liberties.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The choice betwee hair testing and performance
testing marks a crucial crossroads for the nation's drug policy.
While the outcome remains to be seen, there are good reasons to
think that urine and hair testing will eventually be rejected for
all but forensic purposes, given their basic inability to measure
competence. Drug urine testing is perhaps best understood as a
tool for imposing social conformity that has aptly been described
as &quot;chemical McCarthyism.&quot; (30) Like the loyalty oath
of the fifties, urinalysis seeks to impose &quot;politically
correct&quot; attitudes in the workforce. As drugs have replaced
Communism as domestic enemy number one, so the question,
&quot;Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist
party?&quot; has been replaced by, &quot;Are you now or have you
been the user of a controlled substance?&quot; When the current
anti-drug hysteria subsides, the absurdity of this question will
become apparent.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Technologically, drug urine testing can best be
compared to that other tool of McCarthyism, the polygraph. Like
the polygraph, drug testing rests on the spurious premise that
the human mind can be read via crude physiological measures. Like
the polygraph, drug testing is inherently misleading and
endangers innocent parties. Time has revealed the polygraph to be
an essentially flawed technology, and it has now been outlawed
for most purposes (ironically, by the very same Congress that
eagerly embraced random urinalysis). In the fullness of time, it
can be expected that the same will happen to drug urinalysis. As
the costs of drug testing are examined more closely, it is apt to
be seen that human beings are best judged by their perormance,
not the chemicals in their urine.</font></p>

<h1><font size="3">Meta-Analysis of Adolescent Crime and
Substance Use, 1981-1995</font></h1>

<p><font size="3">Gordon E. Kenney, Ph.D. The University of
Memphis Memphis, Tennessee, USA 38152 </font><a
href="mailto:gkenney@memphis.edu"><font size="3">gkenney@memphis.edu</font></a></p>

<p><font size="3">December, 1996</font></p>

<p><font size="3">INTRODUCTION </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The use of psychoactive substances has been
cited by drug enforcement officials as a cause of criminal
behavior. Apart from the manufacture, sale, and/or delivery of
illicit substances, substance *use* has been regarded as a
primary precipitant of criminal behavior, especially violent
behavior (e.g., Drug Enforcement Administration, 1994). To date,
however, it seems that such assertions have been based on
anecdotal evidence, with little, if any, empirical support. Even
data from the federal government fails to support such a link.
For example, during 9 contemporaneous reporting periods between
1972 and 1990, the correlations between adolescent (ages 17 and
younger) violent, property, and overall crime rates and mean
adolescent (ages 12-17) usage rates for 10 substances (both licit
and illicit) were .09, .27, and .20, respectively (Federal Bureau
of Investigation, 1972-90; National Institute on Drug Abuse,
1991). These correlations can hardly be viewed as suggestive of
any meaningful relationships between crime and substance use.
Such evidence, however, is circumstantial. Other indicators are
needed to establish any real relationship, whether large or
small, between crime and drug use.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The purpose of this study was to excavate the
body of recent scholarly research in this domain for any evidence
concerning the role of substance use in criminal acts perpetuated
by adolescents and to summarize these findings using
meta-analysis (Wolf, 1986).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">METHOD &amp; PROCEDURES </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Scholarly research products of a primary nature
were gleaned from social science databases (including
Dissertation Abstracts International, Educational Resources
Information Clearinghouse, PsycLit, and metropolitan Memphis,
Tennessee, book holdings). The search was limited to studies
concerning adolescent criminology reported between 1981 and 1995.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Resultant inferential statistics from each
study pertaining to general delinquency, reoffense, and/or
violence as each related to substance use were converted to
effect sizes in the form of r using Wolf's (1986) formulae. The r
statistic, here used as an effect size, remains essentially a
correlation coefficient which ranges from -1.0 to +1.0, where
-1.0 constitutes a perfect negative relationship, +1.0
constitutes a perfect positive relationship, and 0.0 constitutes
absolutely no relationship. A squared correlation coefficient
(r^2) represents the percentage of shared variance among the
variables in question.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">RESULTS </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Fifteen (15) primary research studies were
found which met the aforementioned criteria (see Table 1). Of
these, 13 were conducted in 10 states in the United States, and 2
were conducted in Canada. There were 6 research articles from
refereed journals, 6 dissertations/theses, 2 unpublished
conference research presentations, and 1 unpublished research
report. A total of 3,583 adolescent offenders were involved in
these 15 studies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The mean unweighted r for the relationship
between adolescent crime and substance use was .22 (df = 13, not
significant), with a median of .17, and a range of .00 to .68.
The amount of shared variance between overall adolescent crime
and substance use was about 5%. The strength of these effect size
estimates was considered low.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only 4 of the studies investigated the
relationship between adolescent violent crime and substance use
(total number of offenders studied was 834). The mean unweighted
r for these studies was .10 (df = 13, not significant), with a
median of .08, and a range of .07 to .15. The amount of shared
variance between violent adolescent crime and substance use was
1%. These effect size estimates were considered very low.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">No discernible temporal pattern was observed.
Overall, the correlation between year of study and effect size
estimate was .02 (df = 13, not significant), which was considered
very low.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Among 7 studies conducted in the
&quot;north&quot; (i.e., Canada, Idaho, Iowa, Massachusetts, and
Washington) the mean unweighted effect size was .23 (df = 5, not
significant), with a median of .25, and a range of .00 to 55.
This effect size was considered low. Among 8 studies conducted in
the &quot;south&quot; (i.e., Florida, Georgia, Maryland,
Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia) the mean unweighted effect size
was .22 (df = 6, not significant), with a median of .16, and a
range of .00 to .68. This effect size was considered low. The
effect sizes based on geography were not considered to be
substantially different.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Gender, ethnocultural heritage, property
crimes, and particular substances used were not evaluated because
these variables were seldom noted in more than a few of the
selected studies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">CONCLUSIONS The relationship between adolescent
crime and substance use was found to be small. Overall, substance
use accounted for only about 5% of the variance associated with
overall adolescent criminal behavior, and less than 1% of the
variance associated with adolescent violent behavior. These
findings were remarkably similar to those involving federal
government data noted earlier. Neither temporal nor geographic
patterns were observed concerning the effect size estimates
reported in the 15 studies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Therefore, assertions about the precipitous
role of substance use in adolescent crime do not appear to be
supported by the body of recent scholarly research in this area.
Similar investigations concerning adult crime and substance use
are warranted before any definite conclusions may be reached
about this controversial issue. It is clear, however, that
adolescent substance use, though a crime in and of itself, is not
fundamentally related to broader indices of adolescent crime.</font></p>

<h1><font size="3">1994 American Management Survey on workplace
drug testing.</font></h1>

<hr>

<p><font size="3">The following is taken from the 1994 American
Management Survey on workplace drug testing. (Unpublished)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The survey responses are for January 1994 and
represent the American Management Association (AMA's) corporate
membership of 7000 U.S. organizations, which employ in total a
quarter of the American workforce.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">According to the survey. . . . </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The percentage of companies that drug test
employees rose from 84.8 % (January 1993) to 87.2% (January 1994)
This represents an increase of over 300% since 1987.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Business category is the most important factor
in the occurrence of testing programs. The two categories most
likely to test are manufacturing firms (93%) and transportation
companies (92%). Size also plays a role -- 91% of organizations
with more than 1000 employees test, though smaller ones aren't
far behind (81%). Geographically, there are fairly substantial
variations too: companies in the desert and mountain states of
the West are the most likely to test (91%), while companies in
New England are the least likely (68%).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">53% of companies that test do so under
government mandate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The test-positive rate, which had fallen
steadily since 1989, levelled in 1993, at 2.5%. The AMA
attributes this not to lesser use, but to the fact that
test-positives rates fell consistently only as the testing pool
increased -- the levelling in 1993 and 1994 reflects the
levelling in the growth of testing programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There is a direct correlation between the
increase in testing and the decrease in test-positive rates.
According to the AMA, this is not because testing acts as a
deterrent to drug use, but rather because as more employees are
being tested for reasons other than suspicion of use, the
test-positive rate would naturally fall.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Among companies that perform random testing,
the 1993 test-positive rate was 2.1%. Among those companies that
test only for cause, the rate was 11.1%.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Companies that offer drug education programs as
well as testing have lower test-positive rates than those that
provide only testing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only 5% of companies neither test employees nor
offer drug education programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Action on test-positive employees: 31% of
companies dismiss test-positives, and more than half of these
offer no other alternative. The rest regard firing as a last
resort, after counselling and disciplinary actions have been
trlied.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">68% of companies test new hires. Tests are
rarely given as part of the application process per se; instead
testing occurs when the applicant has already been offered the
job. The offer is then conditional on the applicant passing the
test. 1% of companies that test new hires will hire
test-positives on a probationary basis; 95% specifically state
that test-positives will not be hired, the rest take other
actions, such as retesting at a later date. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">METHODS -- 82.1% use urine testing. 12.9% use
blood testing. 1.1% use hair testing. 0.9% use performance
testing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Of those who use urine testing, only 70% retest
an initial positive with a more rigorous, confirmatory test. 13%
repeat the same procedure on the same sample. 5% take and test a
new sample. 7% perform no validation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only 79% of those that urine test use
NIDA-certified labs. Only 48% use a medical review officer (MRO)
to analyze test findings, judge them against the testee's medical
history, and render a verdict.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only 6% of firms that test pay lower insurance
premiums because of their programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;It may seem reasonable to assume that
drug testing has a deterrent effect on drug use. . . . However,
no finding of this eight-year AMA survey effort can confirm as a
statistical certainty that testing does in fact deter use. . . .
Testing cannot and should not be expected to take the place of
good supervision. The American Management Association has
consistently advised that. . . . Actions regarding employee
discipline be performance-based.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">SIMPLE WAY TO BEAT URINE TESTS -- JUST DRINK
WATER</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Report from American Academy of Forensic
Sciences</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Forensic Drug Abuse Advisor, Vol. 6, Issue 3,
March 1994</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Workplace drug testing programs can be foiled
by adulterating the specimen, and the adulterants can be added
inside or outside of the body. Last summer it became apparent
that many peole were cheating by adding solutions of concentrated
glutaraldehyde (Urinaid) to their voided sample. New data,
presented in February at the annual meeting of the American
Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS), suggests that there is a
simpler way to foil urine screening tests: drink lots of water.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Edward Cone of the Addiction Research
Center (ARC) in Baltimore, described the results of a study he
had undertaken at the request of Donna Smith, Acting Director of
the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Office of Drug
Enforcement. Smith was concerned that advertising claims for some
herbal teas and &quot;internal cleansing&quot; agents might
actually be true. Cone was at first skeptical, but, as he
reported at the AAFS meeting, the study was a
&quot;sleeper.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cone set up a series of experiments designed to
assess the effect of various measures on &quot;in vivo
adulteration.&quot; Two of the most popular &quot;teas&quot; were
chosen for study; Naturally Klean Herbal Tea&quot; and
&quot;Golden Seal&quot; root capsules. Healthy drug-free
volunteers with a history of recent drug use were recruited for
the study. They were housed in a closed ward for six weeks. The
participants were tested under a number of different protocols
during that six week period.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At 9:00 AM on the morning of Day One the study
subjects smoked a standardized marijuana cigarette (3.58% THC).
On Day Three they snorted 40 mg of cocaine. Twenty three hours
after each drug was given, they drank one of the following
combinations: (1) &quot;Naturally Klean Herbal Tea&quot; in one
gallon of water, (2) one gallon of water without any
&quot;cleansing agent&quot; (3) one gallon of water with 50 mg of
hydrochlorothiadize (a diuretic), (4) four &quot;Golden
Seal&quot; capsules and one gallon of water, or (5) twelve ounces
of water. Each participant was tested under each protocol and all
of the urine was collected.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The urine specimens were then tested by EMIT II
assay for cannabinoids at a 50 ng / ml cutoff, and cocaine at a
300 ng / ml cutoff. Specific gravity and creatinine content was
measured for each sample, and the two indicators were found to
co-vary almost identically. Just drinking 12 ounces of water was
enough to cause a significant decrease in both specific gravity
and creatinine, but not enough to cause a negative test response.
For example, urine cannabinoids levels which were higher than
10,000 ng / ml dropped to the low 100's after drinking 12 ounces
of water. After drinking a gallon of water, with or without one
of the &quot;cleansing agents&quot; added, it only took an hour
for the specific gravity to drop to less than 1.005.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">When one gallon of water was drunk, not only
did specific gravity fall to very low levels (creatinine&lt;20,
and specific gravity &lt;1.003), but the marijuana assay turned
negative and stayed that way, even after specific gravity levels
had returned to normal! The cocaine tests turned negative for a
few hours, but then turned positive again. The same results were
observed whether or not tea was used, however, when diuretics
were given, the test for both cannabinoids and cocaine turned
negative and stayed that way.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cone concluded that &quot;drug test outcome is
highly susceptible to water dilution; and the effects of dilution
are reflected concurrently in creatinine and specific gravity
measures.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">COMMENT: This observation will cause some
consternation in the drug testing community, and create more
problems than glutaraldehyde and Urinaid adulteration did. It is
not that difficult to develop detection strategies for chemicals
like glutaraldehyde. That may explain why the practice is already
starting to disappear, but setting standards for dilution will be
much more difficult. Eventually, it may be necessary to measure
drug / creatinine ratios to rule out dilution. Since tests may
remain negative even after the specific gravity returns toward
normal, it appears that low specific gravities cannot be relied
upn to reveal &quot;adulterated&quot; specimens. </font></p>

<h2 align="center">AMERICA HELD PRISONER </h2>

<p align="center"><b>by Hugh Downs</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>Recorded: April 14, 1994</b> </p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>I received a letter from Mr. Clifford A. Schaffer recently.
Clifford Schaffer is the co-author of the Resolution for a
Federal Commission on Drug Policy, the now famous Hoover
Resolution that seeks to end the violence caused by the infamous
war on drugs. </p>

<p>I long ago realized that a shooting war waged against a
medical condition is inappropriate. I have never really
understood why it is that so many individuals in the government
could have chosen such an ill-advised and disastrous course, and
perhaps I never will understand. But Mr. Schaffer tells me that
the situation is worse than I had imagined. </p>

<p>I should say at the outset that I learned that Clifford
Schaffer is the man who coined that most quotable of quotes,
&quot;More Colombians die from American tobacco than the number
of Americans who die from Colombian cocaine.&quot; I have found
this particular fact a sobering notion to ponder and have
repeated it, even on this program. Now that I know the source, he
should get credit. His letter contained many such startling facts
about the bloody and unjust &quot;war against drugs&quot; --
facts that made me stop and wonder why we continue to fight it.
Mr. Schaffer tells me that in six short years, in the year 2000,
the United States of America will have a prison population bigger
than all the Nazi concentration camps put together. </p>

<p>Let's put this projection into perspective. Mr. Schaffer says,
&quot;Right now we have about 1.3 million people in prison. More
than 600,000 of them are there for non-violent drug offenses. For
every person who died from illegal drugs last year, 150 people
went to prison. Most of them were black men.&quot; </p>

<p>The expense of maintaining a prison population is staggering.
If nearly half of them don't belong there, then something is
terribly wrong. </p>

<p>As the drug war escalates, more prisoners will be taken and
more dead and wounded will litter our streets. Remember, by the
year 2000 we will have more prisoners than all the Nazi
concentration camps combined. Mr. Schaffer's prediction seems
almost incredible, but one look down the street will convince
almost anybody that America is a dangerous place. Many foreign
governments routinely issue warnings to their traveling citizens
that America is a dangerous place. We are, after all, at war. </p>

<p>Drug warriors justify their war against the American people by
claiming that certain illegal drugs are killing our children,
killing adults, and generally ruining our society. But look at
the figures on drugs and death. In a typical year, the
approximate number of people who die from taking cocaine hovers
around 2,500 people. Heroin deaths are less than that, at about
2,000. To give some perspective to these numbers, it's useful to
bear in mind that 2,000 people die every year from taking
aspirin, too. Aspirin can cause catastrophic intestinal bleeding
and death. And can be easily used to that effect, legally, by
suicides. </p>

<p>Tobacco which, so far, is still a legal drug, kills around
400,000 people every year. The government supports tobacco
production, and helps to sell American tobacco products around
the world. Another 50,000 people die from sidestream tobacco
smoke. These deaths occur in people who don't smoke at all; they
just happen to inhale other people's smoke. Ironically, tobacco
is considered such an acceptable drug that, according to Peter
McWilliams, four major tobacco companies (in other words, drug
dealers) became &quot;partners&quot; in the anti-drug group
Partnership for a Drug-Free America. </p>

<p>Every year, approximately 10,000 people die from prescription
drugs. Some of these deaths are due to miscalculated
self-medication; others are due to interaction with existing
medical conditions (or with other drugs) that were unforeseen or
ignored by the prescribing physician; and I'd guess that some of
these deaths were intentional suicides too. </p>

<p>The total number of deaths due to all the illegal drugs
combined is about 4,500 people. Now compare 4,500 deaths with the
number of deaths due to prescription drugs, alcohol (which is
about 80,000 people), tobacco, over-the-counter aspirin, and
sidestream smoke. The total number of deaths due to these legal
drugs is well over 500,000 people -- every year. The
multi-billion dollar drug war ignores the half-a-million deaths
due to legal drugs and instead makes the illogical claim that
4,500 deaths due to illegal drugs justifies a multi-billion
dollar shooting war. </p>

<p>So far, I have not mentioned marijuana. Marijuana is illegal
and tens of thousands of non-violent people are in prison because
of it. There are no deaths attributed to marijuana use. Nobody
dies. In fact, Mr. Schaffer tells us that &quot;Even the DEA
itself says that there has not been a recorded death due to
marijuana in the history of the United States.&quot; </p>

<p>Apparently, millions of Americans continue to smoke marijuana
regardless of the law and regardless of the war waged against
them. Neither prohibitive law nor official brutality seems to
have it's intended effect. </p>

<p>There is something else about marijuana which grabs our
attention. Marijuana is also a pharmaceutical drug that has
established therapeutic use in a variety of medical conditions.
But, since it is caught up in the hysteria of the drug war,
doctors are prohibited from conducting research on marijuana and
patients are deprived of its benefits. </p>

<p>A recently published book called Marihuana, the Forbidden
Medicine tells all. The authors of this book are Lester Grinspoon
and James Bakalar. Dr. Grinspoon is a medical doctor and an
associate professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School.
Mr. Bakalar is an associate editor of the Harvard Mental Health
Letter and a lecturer in law in the Department of Psychiatry at
Harvard. </p>

<p>The authors record a surprising number of therapeutic uses for
marijuana -- the list considers more than twenty years of
research. Marijuana counteracts the violent effects of
chemotherapy used in cancer treatment --- and to those who say
that marijuana must be bad because it is smoked and smoking is
bad, Dr. Grinspoon points out that the more powerful strains of
marijuana found today actually require less smoking to obtain
therapeutic levels. Patients consistently report that synthetic
versions do not work. </p>

<p>The pressure on the eyes resulting from glaucoma is relieved
with marihuana use. The amelioration of other conditions, too,
are on record; and conditions that include epilepsy, multiple
sclerosis, paraplegia and quadriplegia; AIDS; chronic pain;
migraine; pruritis; menstrual cramps and labor pain; and even
depression and other mood disorders. </p>

<p>It makes you stop and think. Here is a weed, growing wild that
millions use whether there is a law against it or not. It kills
no one. It has been in continuous use for about 5,000 years that
we know of, and it has recognized medical applications. And yet
the government is waging a deadly and expensive war against it. </p>

<p>This mystery deepens considerably when we learn that the
government sits on an impressive pile of studies that recommend
the decriminalization of, not only marijuana, but of several
other drugs as well. </p>

<p>In 1944, there was the LaGuardia Committee Report; in 1967
there was the Baroness Wootton Report published by the government
of Great Britain. In 1969, the Canadian government published the
Report of the Canadian Government Commission of Inquiry into the
Non-Medical Use of Drugs. In 1972, there was Dealing with Drug
Abuse: A Report to the Ford Foundation. Also in 1972 the
Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs came out. </p>

<p>In 1973, the US Federal Government itself published the Report
of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse. In 1980,
the United States Drug Abuse Council published The Facts About
Drug Abuse. In 9182 there was An Analysis of Marijuana Policy and
most recently, the state of California's study titled, The Report
of the California State Research Advisory Panel. </p>

<p>All of these official studies urge decriminalization. The also
add the sensible caution that all drugs are dangerous drugs. Many
drug war proponents are aware of these studies but mysteriously,
they continue a reign of bloodshed in spite of the evidence. They
continue to panic the nation with myths and half truths about
drug use. Based on fictions, and fallacies, the drug warriors
extract billions of dollars from the public treasury and ruin the
lives of people who, in many cases, are already in ruinous
condition and need medical attention. </p>

<p>At the beginning of their book, Dr. Grinspoon and Mr. Bakalar
quote another, earlier Harvard professor, Alfred North Whitehead.
Whitehead said, &quot;The rejection of any source of evidence is
always treason to that ultimate rationalism which urges forward
science and philosophy alike.&quot; </p>

<p>Many Americans are in step with this sentiment and condemn
those people who champion violence and drug hysteria as
committing precisely this kind of treason. The evidence that
urges use to decriminalize drugs and stop the violence is
plentiful. </p>

<p>I find it hard to imagine that the drug warriors are really so
dull-witted that they cannot grasp this evidence or that they
cannot grasp the findings of their peers. In fact, it is entirely
possible that some of them actually do grasp the facts and
dishonestly argue against them. But why would anyone do that? </p>

<p>Dr. Grinspoon and Mr. Bakalar make a fascinating suggestion as
to why this could be true. They say, &quot;Attitudes toward
minorities, work, worldly success and failure, sex and family
life may be the real issues in the controversy about drugs. Drugs
are symbols charged with cultural tension. Repressed anxieties
may be displaced onto drug users as a form of scapegoating.&quot;
</p>

<p>The authors point out that &quot;We do not fine or jail the
patients of someone who practices medicine without a license, or
the customers of a manufacturer who disobeys consumer protection
laws, yet mere possession of cannabis and other illicit
psychoactive drugs is a Federal crime. The metaphor of war is
rarely invoked in the name of consumer protection but constantly
used in the assault on psychoactive drugs. The reason is that
laws controlling these drugs are ultimately aimed not at consumer
protection but at containing what is believed to be a threat to
the social fabric and moral order.&quot; </p>

<p>But, in light of all the government studies, and the growing
number of Americans who have signed the Hoover Institution's
Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy, it is right
to wonder if the drug soldiers themselves might not have fallen
over on the wrong side of the moral fence. <br>

<h2>PCP and Violence </h2>

<p><b>excerpted from : Drug Abuse and Drug Abuse Research, an
annual report to congress by the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human
Services, pg. 153. (1991)</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;There are two aspects to phencyclidine (PCP)
intoxication that have warranted particular attention by the
general public, as well as by law-enforcement and clinical
personnel. Both aspects concern the relationship between
phencyclidine abuse and aggressive behavior. There are reports of
increased aggressiveness and 'super-human' strength that develop
in some people who take phencyclidine. </p>

<p>Recent studies, including those of men arrested for criminal
activity in Washington D.C. and New York City (Wish 1986) and
evaluations of published clinical reports of phencyclidine
intoxication (Brecher et al. 1988), indicate that if
phencyclidine induces violent, criminal behavior, it does so only
extremely infrequently. </p>

<p>Although Wish (1986) noted that most men who had urines
positive for phencyclidine were younger than those who had taken
no drugs or other drugs, their crimes were likely to be less
aggressive than the crimes of those who had not taken
phencyclidine. </p>

<p>Khajawall et al. (1982) found no difference in the behavior of
clients admitted for phencyclidine detoxification and those
admitted for opioid detoxification. Thus, phencylidine-induced
aggression appears to be a rare phenomenon, if it occurs at
all.&quot; </p>

<p>MARIJUANA...THE INSIDIOUS DRUG </p>

<p>(Books Pot Safari and Marijuana Alert, Peggy Mann, McGraw
Hill) </p>

<p>THC </p>

<p>Known &gt;300 years for its psychoactivity </p>

<p>delta-nine tetrahydrocannabinol </p>

<p>a) regular grade </p>

<p>b) Sensimilla </p>

<p>c) Hashish </p>

<p>d) Hash oil </p>

<p>Needs heat activation (smoking, tea or brownies) </p>

<p>Currently, plain marijuana up to 9x stronger than in 1973. </p>

<p>1973 1983 </p>

<p>reg 0.5% THC 3.5% THC </p>

<p>sensi 6% 10-12% </p>

<p>hashish 8% 15% </p>

<p>oil 15-30% 20-60% </p>

<p>Regular grade...seeds etc. Backyard variety </p>

<p>Sensimilla &quot;preferred&quot; mature seedless female plants
grown away </p>

<p>from male. The largest cash crop of California, Oregon and
Hawaii </p>

<p>and second nationally behind corn. One plant costs $200 to
grow, </p>

<p>worth up to $2500. 25% is grown in US national forests, often </p>

<p>booby-trapped. In 1975 worth $400 per pound, now $3500 per
pound. </p>

<p>In Ohio in 1987 25% of plants confiscated, about 255000 plants
</p>

<p>left or $540 million. </p>

<p>Hashish...made in Pakistan/Afganistan and imported.
Deteriorates </p>

<p>at about 10% per month. </p>

<p>Hash Oil is the concentrated form which is put on a cigarette
to </p>

<p>double the potency. </p>

<p>PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>More carcinogens than tobacco. More lung irritation than
tobacco. </p>

<p>More number of carcinogens than tobacco. </p>

<p>If ingested has erratic absorption and is deactivated in the </p>

<p>liver like narcotics are...thus less potent but longer high. </p>

<p>If smoked, about 100% of the THC is absorbed into the </p>

<p>pulmonary system and then into the fatty system ie. brain, </p>

<p>testicles and ovaries, heart. </p>

<p>See reddened eyes and increased heart rate due to THC. </p>

<p>ANIMAL STUDIES </p>

<p>THC attaches to the cerebellum, spinal cord and hippocampus. </p>

<p>Hippocampus is responsible for short term memory. If removed--
</p>

<p>global amnesia. THC in rats causes brain cell death. </p>

<p>Monkey studies...smoke 5 days/week x 1 year then free x 1 </p>

<p>year caused profound lack of interest in learning and no
memory. </p>

<p>Same experiment smoking weekend only caused moderade damage
and </p>

<p>loss of memory. These were permanent changes. </p>

<p>Does it do this in humans? Our current users will be the </p>

<p>guinea pigs for this experiment. Scientists expect the answer
to </p>

<p>be yes. </p>

<p>EFFECTS IN HUMANS </p>

<p>Affects behavioural mood and memory functions. Decreases
cerebral </p>

<p>blood flow while smoking. </p>

<p>Of students failing or leaving school, 1/25 were not pot </p>

<p>users, 3/5 of students regularly smoking pot failed. </p>

<p>Flight simulator and pilors after 1 cigarette...each pilot </p>

<p>did significantly worse with one pilot missing the runway. </p>

<p>Significantly, all pilots thought they were doing very well. </p>

<p>The single greatest risk factor for cocaine abuse is </p>

<p>marijuana use before age 15. </p>

<p>AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME </p>

<p>1. Loss of interest, apathy, desire to work </p>

<p>2. Fatigue, loss of energy/tiredness </p>

<p>3. Depression/attacks of rage when provoked </p>

<p>4. Slovenliness in habits and appearance </p>

<p>For chronic users, clearly has been shown that memory tests
and </p>

<p>auditory and visual retention tests were poorly done even
after 6 </p>

<p>weeks of sobriety. </p>

<p>In a study of alcohol/pot related accidents, suggested pot may
be </p>

<p>responsible for more accidents than alcohol (due to impaired </p>

<p>judgement etc) </p>

<p>In a number of cases, heavy use 4-5x a week up to 15
cigarettes </p>

<p>per cay caused amnesia for the first 7-8 days of sobriety. </p>

<p>Amnesia was not recognized by the user. </p>

<p>Sheba=PCP added. Smells like embalming fluid </p>

<p>Few drops of vinegar in urine will give negative marijuana
test </p>

<p>Drug screen 50-75 level CANNOT BE PASSIVE. No false positives.
It </p>

<p>is like a fingerprint. In a job screen should always do a </p>

<p>confirmation titer if a screen is positive. </p>

<p>CHEMICALS IN MARIJUANA </p>

<p>421 chemicals. 65 are different cannabinols which are </p>

<p>psychoactive (delta-nine most) Others include non-cannabinols </p>

<p>such as toxins, carcinogens (such as tar, just like the tar on
the </p>

<p>road) and inactive or potentiating agents </p>

<p>Alcohol takes 6-8 hours to get out of body </p>

<p>THC is fat-soluble, and 50% will be in the body 1-2 weeks
later. </p>

<p>May take up to 4 months to get all out. Heavy use for 6-12
months </p>

<p>will give positive drug screen 4-6 weeks later. </p>

<p>A chronic pot user is raraly sober. Subclinical </p>

<p>intoxication. 2-3 times a week sufficient for this. Level </p>

<p>released from fat as acute level drops. Stored in all fat and </p>

<p>also in the basic building cells of the body. </p>

<p>Damage is DOSE RELATED. Depends on frequency and on </p>

<p>concentration. The more mature the person the less permanent </p>

<p>damage. Symptoms are insidious and subtle and can parallel </p>

<p>adolescent adjustment symptoms. THC exaggerates these
symptoms, </p>

<p>makes them more profound and often permanent. Saturation in
the </p>

<p>brain causes memory impairment, concentration impairment and </p>

<p>motivation impairment. Can be a major personality change. As
the </p>

<p>brain level decreased THC moves from other body fat to the
brain </p>

<p>to keep the brain saturated. Can actually prevent the
cognitive </p>

<p>changes needed for an adolescent to change to an adult,
leaving </p>

<p>him/her with poor social judgement, poor attention span,
confusion </p>

<p>and anxiety and loss of train of thought. Occasionally
produces </p>

<p>hyperactive/aggressive/agitated person instead of apathy. This
</p>

<p>damage can occur in MONTHS rather than years. ALL USERS </p>

<p>REGARDLESS OF AGE AND ABILITY HAVE DECREASED ABILITY IN
COMPARISON </p>

<p>TO THEIR POTENTIAL ABILITY. Regression to immaturity can occur
</p>

<p>and can be irreversible. A teenager can develop, for example,
a </p>

<p>mental age of 11 and thus not be able to complete school work </p>

<p>causing a dropout from school. </p>

<p>Pot more potent than in past years, age of onset much earlier </p>

<p>and thus the profile of a marijuana user is changing. </p>

<p>a) much higher suicidal ideation and depression </p>

<p>b) 1/3 show borderline schizophrenia traits with disorganized </p>

<p>thought patterns. </p>

<p>c) Paranoia increasing </p>

<p>d) Lots of similarities to a senile adult. Difference in time </p>

<p>perception (10 minutes seems like 1 hour). Erratic junk foods.
</p>

<p>Poor judgement. Cannot self-correct. Much like Altzheimer's </p>

<p>disease. </p>

<p>e) As use continues with subacute intoxication, decreasing </p>

<p>cognitive ability, decline in emotional life, much increase in
</p>

<p>stubbornness. More fatigue, decreased ability to do complex </p>

<p>tasks, no self-insight, no idea of time and dates, impaired
short- </p>

<p>term meory and occasionally long-term as well. With Moderate
dose </p>

<p>get profound gross impairment of motor skills. (See how much
like </p>

<p>brain-damaged adult?) With high dose can get hallucinations. </p>

<p>Feel that THC may be the cause of massive adolescent
psychiatric </p>

<p>problems. MUCH PROOF HERE and much refusal of the user to take
</p>

<p>this information seriously...still relying on the information
from </p>

<p>the 1960s that THC was not harmful. User does not wish to look
</p>

<p>the data straight in the eyes. </p>

<p>Major driving impairments...&quot;behavioural toxicity&quot;.
The </p>

<p>stoned person does not perceive the dangers. He can briefly
hide </p>

<p>the influence and pay attention but easily loses focus. Coming
</p>

<p>down from a high may be the worst for motor skills.
Occasionally </p>

<p>get a triggered unexpected after-high. </p>

<p>39% more likely to have a driving accident if smoke THC and </p>

<p>drive. Reckless driving, failure to yield, failure to stop. </p>

<p>How to tell if the memory/behavior is THC? STOP for two </p>

<p>months and see if symptoms go away. </p>

<p>MARIJUANA ADDICT </p>

<p>1. First stage is exposure. </p>

<p>2. Second stage...the person learns the mood swing, starts to
use </p>

<p>it as a drug and seek it and plan for its use = second stage
of </p>

<p>addiction. </p>

<p>3. Third stage..user becomes preoccupied with the mood swing. </p>

<p>Develops tolerance. May use 3-4 x per day up to 15 per day =
much </p>

<p>increased tolerance. Develops a preoccupied with chemical </p>

<p>dependence life style. </p>

<p>4. In the fourth stage the addict is using the drug to be
NORMAL. </p>

<p>Uses first in the AM, last at night, using it just to
function. </p>

<p>*Stages three and four...the patient usually cannot stop on
his </p>

<p>own but needs a formal treatment program. </p>

<p>For those who have smoked more than 1000x in three or four
years: </p>

<p>70-80% have tried cocaine </p>

<p>1/3 have tried heroin </p>

<p>Only 0-1% of heroin users never smoked pot. </p>

<p>The percentage of use of cocaine is directly related to the </p>

<p>frequency of use of pot. </p>

<p>In stage four with increased tolerance the addict uses more </p>

<p>of the higher grade THC, starts mixing drugs, seeks out more
heavy </p>

<p>using friends. The addict is very seriously disabled with
social </p>

<p>and psychological disabilities, panic attacks, nausea et.c Ego
</p>

<p>deterioration develops (with the denial that the drug causes
the </p>

<p>problem, it follows that the person himself must be causing
the </p>

<p>problem. This brings out guilt and shame which recycles to use
of </p>

<p>more drugs). </p>

<p>See social and school deterioration, dropping off team, </p>

<p>dropping hobbies. Finally psychotic-like fog in thinking. </p>

<p>**This can last as long as two or more years after drug
cessation. </p>

<p>SYMPTOMS CHECKLIST FOR LEVEL OF ADDICTION </p>

<p>Three predominant symptoms are </p>

<p>a) progressive chemical use </p>

<p>b) chemically oriented lifestyle </p>

<p>c) increasing tolerance </p>

<p>Parents should be aware...addicted teenager will use avoidance
</p>

<p>techniques, visine in eyes, frequently changes the room (more
drug </p>

<p>oriented pictures etc) dropping grades. </p>

<p>Often a strong family history of chemical dependency or
alcohol </p>

<p>dependency. Usage of THC not hereditary but the addiction </p>

<p>development probably is. </p>

<p>TREATMENT </p>

<p>Marijuana is an isolator. Questions asked are &quot;Where did
you </p>

<p>get it&quot; and &quot;How can I get some&quot;. NOT a drug
that explores </p>

<p>feelings. Feelings (mad glad sad) tend to be suppressed. </p>

<p>Treatment must explore feelings and teach its vocabulary.
Group </p>

<p>therapy can help. </p>

<p>Treatment must teach alternative ways to cope...how to handle </p>

<p>a headache (user does not handle pain well...has avoided the </p>

<p>feeling of pain in the past). Must set rules and limits. Must </p>

<p>address the amotivational syndrome in the treatment program. </p>

<p>Avoid the assignment to &quot;read a book and write how to
talk </p>

<p>with people&quot; but give the assignment to DO the behavior.
Remember </p>

<p>the immaturity and the age level caused by the drug when
making </p>

<p>assignments. </p>

<p>Treat the denial. &quot;No big thing&quot; is not true. You

<h1>FACTS ABOUT MARIJUANA </h1>

<h2>Marijuana: Drug of Deception </h2>

<p><b>A publication of the Lions Club</b> </p>

<p>This is the full text - unedited -- of a brochure on marijuana
put out by the Lions Club International. </p>

<p>The statements made about marijuana range from laughable to
ridiculous. None of them, that I can find, are supported by any
kind of scientific evidence, except maybe for that stuff about
the red eyes. They even say that marijuana use causes weight
loss! Curiously, they do not mention &quot;the munchies.&quot; </p>

<p>Readers are encouraged to write to the Lions Club at the
address below and correct their misinformation by pointing to
these web pages. </p>

<hr>

<p>Marijuana is made from the leaves, small stems, and flowering
tops of the Cannabis sativa plant. Marijuana, also called pot,
grass, weed, is usually smoked in a loosely- rolled joint or in a
pipe. It has a sweet, lingering odor. </p>

<p>Marijuana causes the user to experience a feeling of
well-being---of detachment from ordinary circumstances. This
&quot;high&quot; is usually followed by feelings of depression. </p>

<p>Marijuana is not just one substance; it contains more than 400
chemicals. The most widely known compund in this group is
commonly called THC (delta- 9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol). </p>

<p>THC is the primary mind-altering ingredient in marijuana. A
portion of THC is absorbed into fatty tissue in the brain and
reproductive organs, and in most other organs as well. It takes
the body at least 30 days to eliminate all effects of smoking one
marijuana joint. </p>

<p>Marijuana is up to ten times more potent today than that which
was produced in the 1960s. </p>

<p>Some experts previously thought Marijuana to be harmless. It
is now known that the reasons users can stop smoking without
feeling severe withdrawal symptoms is because of the body's
storage of THC. Effects of Marijuana on the body </p>

<p>* Marijuana reduces brain energy, impairing the users' ability
to remember, feel, think, anticipate, and predict. </p>

<p>* Because THC is stored in fatty tissues and works like a
time-release capsule, regular marijuana smoking produces a
constant state of sedation. </p>

<p>* Since THC remains in the center of motivation of the brain,
it weakens the users' ability to live drug-free. </p>

<p>* The lungs of marijuana smokers are highly susceptible to
emphysema and bronchitis. </p>

<p>* Research shows that marijuana contains cancer-causing
agents. </p>

<p>* Marijuana impairs normal sexual development in both males
and females. </p>

<p>* Heartbeat rate increses by as much as 50% through marijuana
use. Results are chest pains, and possible heart disease. </p>

<p>* Regular use causes a decrease in the blood supply to the
heart, and diminishes white cell production. </p>

<p>* The body adjusts to regular use, making it essential to
increase the amount used in order to achieve a &quot;high&quot;. </p>

<p>* Continual marijuana use deteriorates the body's immune
system. </p>

<p>Symptoms of Marijuana use </p>

<p>* Marked change in behavior patterns </p>

<p>* Carelessness about personal appearance </p>

<p>* Lack of motivation </p>

<p>* Reduction of short-term memory </p>

<p>* Excessive irritability </p>

<p>* Red eyes and fatigue </p>

<p>* Abrupt mood changes/outbursts of anger </p>

<p>* Less concern for the feelings of others </p>

<p>* Bouts of depression/paranoia </p>

<p>* Inability to react quickly/decreased coordination </p>

<p>* Inability to get along with family/co-workers/peers </p>

<p>* Loss of weight </p>

<p>* Sleeplessness [to go with the fatigue I suppose] </p>

<p>* Short concentration-span </p>

<p>* Highly susceptible to common infections </p>

<p>* Expressionless speech/blank stares </p>

<p>* Faulty perception (cannot accurately judge distances, speed
or time) </p>

<p>* Decreased academic or work performance </p>

<p>Marijuana connection </p>

<p>Some researchers have found a direct link between increased
marijuana use, and </p>

<p>--juvenile and young adult crime such as theft </p>

<p>--truancy and school drop-out rate </p>

<p>--psychiatric referrals of adolescents and young adults </p>

<p>--cases of teenage chronic organic brain syndrome (burnout) </p>

<p>Lions Drug Awareness Program </p>

<p>Since its inception in 1984, the Lions Drug Awareness Program
has emphasized prevention through education. Lions are working
together to join families, educators, and other key leaders in a
concentrated effort to create drug-free communities. </p>

<p>Lions' primary focus is Lions-Quest &quot;Skills for
Adolescence,&quot; and Lions-Quest &quot;Skills for
Growing.&quot; These positive prevention curricula span
Kindergarten through eighth grade, and are helping young people
choose healthy lifestyles. </p>

<h1>Three articles on the Drug Problem </h1>

<p><b>From the Economist May 15 -21, 1993</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>In 1883, Benjamin Ward Richardson, a distinguished British
doctor, denounced the evils of drinking tea. He said it caused an
&quot;extremely nervous semi-hysterical condition&quot;. In 1936,
an article in the American Journal of Nursing claimed that a
marijuana taker &quot;will suddenly turn with murderous violence
upon whomever is nearest to him&quot;. Tea and marijuana have
three things in common: they alter the moods of those who take
them, they are regarded as tolerable safe, and they are
addictive. </p>

<p>Attitudes to addiction are complicated and often
contradictory. Tea and marijuana are in themselves fairly
harmless, yet tea is generally legal and marijuana is not.
Tobacco and cocaine are harmful but, again, tobacco is almost
universally allowed, whereas most readers of The Economist live
in countries which may imprison you for possessing cocaine. </p>

<p>Throw in the joker of addictions which come not in syringes or
cigarettes, but in casinos and computer cartridges, and you have
a fine arena for combat between libertarians and puritans. </p>

<p>This battle, always lively, has just become hotter. On April
28th Bill Clinton appointed Lee Brown, a former policeman, as
America's new &quot;drug tsar&quot;, and thus leader of the
worlds toughest prohibition programme. Ten days before, Italians
had voted to move in the other direction by scrapping the
harshest measures of their drug laws. </p>

<p>Such boldness is rare. The attitude of most electorates and
governments is to deplore the problems that the illegal drug
trade brings, view the whole matter with distaste, and sit on the
status quo--a policy of sweeping prohibition. Yet the problems
cannot be ignored. The crime to which some addicts resort to
finance their habits, and in which the suppliers of illegal drugs
habitually engage, exacts its price in victims' lives, not just
money. The illegal trade in drugs supports organised crime the
world over. It pulls drug-takers into a world of filthy needles,
poisoned doses and pushers bent upon selling them more addictive
and dangerous fixes. </p>

<p>Yet most people still balk at exploring ways in which a legal
regime might undermine such effects. Their refusal owes something
to a distaste for addiction in itself. This is an argument shot
through with inconsistency. The strongest disapproval often comes
from those who scream about liberties if their own particular
indulgences--for assault rifles, say--are attacked. Addiction to
cigarettes is reckoned to be the chief avoidable cause of death
in the world. Alcohol deprives boozers of their livers and their
memories, and ends the lives of all too many innocents who get
smashed on the roads by the inebriated. Yet here the idea of
dissuasion within the law is broadly accepted. </p>

<p>A much sounder basis for doubt is the worry that legalisation
would increase drug-taking, and that rising consumption and
addiction would overwhelm the gains to be had from getting drugs
within the law. Yet legalisation should not be taken to mean a
lawless free-for-all, with no restraint on the supply or use of
drugs. Done properly, it would allow governments to take control
of the distribution and quality of these substances away from the
criminals. Quality control is decisive, because much of the
damage done by drugs bought on street corners is caused by
adulterated products; in much the same way, carelessly distilled
hooch can cause blindness. </p>

<p>Supply would be regulated by a system of government licences
analogous to those already in force for tobacco and alcohol (and
which would serve, among other things, to keep drugs out of the
hands of children), backed by strict policing and heavy
penalties. The toughness of the regime would rise with the
addictiveness of the drug in question--a light touch for
marijuana, an extremely dissuasive one for heroin.Such
legalisation would not magically dispense with the need for
policemen, but it would make the needed policing more manageable.
</p>

<p>Particularly in the business of softer drugs, where the taxes
can be lower and the restrictions less onerous, and where the
first trial steps towards legalisation should take place, it
would undermine the &quot;risk premium&quot; that provides drug
cartels with their profits. Taxes raised on what is reckoned to
be the world's largest untaxed industry would help governments
spend money on treatment and education, which would do more good
than the billions currently spent on attempting to throttle the
criminal supply of drugs of all sorts. </p>

<p>The Quest for Soma </p>

<p>There is another consideration, one for the future. The
illegality of drugs, coupled with distaste for pleasurable
addiction, is skewing research. Progress is being made by
scientists in understanding both what causes the pleasure of
drugs and what makes the pleasure so hard to give up. Currently
such research is obliged to have only one aim--unhooking existing
addicts. </p>

<p>It might have another. In many areas of pharmacology,
researchers are exploring the idea of &quot;designer drugs&quot;,
chemicals tailored to fit harmlessly into human biochemistry.
Addiction research should be encouraged to do the same: to move
beyond devising better therapies for those who wish to kick the
drug habit, into the invention of safer, more effective and less
habit-forming highs. At the moment it cannot, for a safe drug
equals a &quot;substance abuse&quot; equals a crime. </p>

<p>The fact remains that any legal regime which lowers the
economic incentive for drugs-crime will surely boost drug
consumption. The question is by how much. One possible pointer is
that, when asked, people say it will not rise a lot. In opinion
polls, Americans generally insist that they would not be
persuaded by legalisation to try drugs they are not taking now.
There is some reason to believe them, despite the first instinct
to be sceptical, since they already have access to plenty of
mindbending substances, from alcohol and tobacco to diet pills. </p>

<p>Then there is reassurance from experiments. The American
states that decriminalised marijuana during the 1970s saw no
divergence in the consumption of the drug from that in
neighbouring states which continued to prohibit it. Extensive
experience with decriminalisation in Holland shows that not only
is there no accompanying surge in consumption--allowing for the
inrush of addicts from more restrictive countries--but related
crime falls when drugs are legalised. </p>

<p>One further argument is used by defenders of the status quo.
They say that, even if the case for exploring legalisation were
conceded by governments, public resistance would doom the idea.
This is hardly surprising, given the way governments the would
over have for decades hammered home the dogma of prohibition. A
more rational discussion could do much to change public opinion.
Only a few years before alcohol prohibition was repealed in the
United States in 1933, public sentiment was similarly dominated
by the opinions of the country's prohibitionist leaders. </p>

<p>There are signs that public instincts are changing. In recent
months a growing number of federal judges and lawyers have voiced
their exasperation with America's approach to drugs. Their
objections led politicians in Washington to hold a meeting
earlier this month to rethink the country's failed drugs
policies. Janet Reno, the attorney-general, started the day be
describing her doubts about America's current approach. It ended,
significantly, with a discussion of the merits of legalisation.
Neither Mr. Brown nor Ms. Reno, and certainly not their boss Mr.
Clinton, has so far supported legalisation. But they have done
what no American administration has dared do in living
memory--set the scene for a proper debate. </p>

<h2>Drugs policy: The enemy within </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>A quiet revolt has been taking place in courtrooms across
America. It has been led by judges disillusioned with the
country's war on drugs. On April 29th Harold Greene, a prominent
federal judge in Washington, ruled that important elements of the
mandatory sentencing laws for drugs offenders were
unconstitutional. Less than two weeks earlier, two senior federal
judges, Jack Weinstein, and Whitman Knapp, of New York, had
announced that they would no longer preside over drugs cases. In
recent months, a number of federal judges have taken such a
stance. It might be a sign, much further down the road, of a
change in policy. Lee Brown, the former New York police chief who
was appointed as &quot;drug tsar&quot; by Bill Clinton on April
28th, is thought to be a good appointment. Apart from that, Mr
Clinton has not done much with drugs policy. Granted, he has been
in office a short while, and has had much to occupy him. But his
drug-policy staff has been cut, and the budget request he has
sent to Congress looks just like the one sent by George Bush. He
has asked for much the same amount of money, divided up in the
same way: two-thirds of the money to criminal-enforcement
efforts, one-third to treatment. </p>

<p>Some had hoped for a change of emphasis. Although the
&quot;war on drugs&quot; was first promoted by Richard Nixon in
1972, it was not until George Bush's term that the war began in
earnest. Mr Bush appointed though-talking drug tsars and spent
$40 billion to attack traffickers abroad and punish pushers and
users at home. The result has been disappointing. cocaine is
available about as freely and cheaply today as in 1989.
Drug-related violence in the cities is still high.The most
praiseworthy part of the Bush policy was a drop in overall
cocaine-taking. But hard-core addicts, who account for
four-fifths of all consumption, are taking as much as ever. Mark
Kleiman, of Harvard University, argues that Mr Bush's policies,
put in place soon after the peak in cocaine's popularity, did
little to affect a decline already under way. Changing fashion
(including the recent surge in heroin-taking) probably deserves
the credit for that. </p>

<p>If casual consumption of cocaine is down, it may well be the
result of education and treatment programmes rather than criminal
enforcement. But enforcement has been, and remains, the core of
American policy. Presidents, naturally, do not want to be seen to
condone the taking of drugs; the public temper is for stiff
penalties and the locking up of offenders, not tender care. But
the effect of the policy, as the American Bar Association pointed
out in a recent report, is that the country's prisons are filled
not only with drug-handlers but also with drug-takers, and cannot
cope with the numbers. Neal Sonnett, the head of the ABA's
criminal-justice section, notes with particular alarm the sharp
rise in incarceration of low-level drug offenders, which has
hindered efforts to fight more serious, and violent, crime. He
thinks the criminal-justice system may be &quot;on the point of
collapse&quot;. If it is, it will be for reasons to do with
overall levels of sentencing for many sorts of crimes, not merely
those related to drugs. But such arguments livened up a drugs
meeting held in Washington on May 7th to rethink America's
policies. At the start of the day Janet Reno, the
attorney-general, admitted dissatisfaction with the present
emphasis on enforcement efforts, and suggested the mandatory
sentencing guidelines might be reviewed. The speech confirmed
hints from Mr. Clinton that, despite his status-quo budget, he
plants to cut back on enforcement efforts, especially overseas,
in favour of trying to reduce demand at home. Another significant
aspect of the meeting was the openness of debate. Prohibition was
not unquestioningly supported. Ethan Nadelmann, a drugs expert
who heads the Princeton Working Group, which is developing
alternative ideas to prohibition, notes that legalisation of
drugs was given a serious hearing. The way forward, he believes,
is towards &quot;harm reduction&quot;. Such efforts, like the one
supported by Kurt Schmoke, the mayor of Baltimore, build on
programmes from parts of Europe and Australia which treat
drug-taking not as a criminal matter, but more as an issue of
personal choice and public health. </p>

<p>A small chorus has applauded such a shift in resources,
arguing that prohibition of drugs will always fail so long as
Americans remain so determined to get hold of them. Mr. Clinton,
who got himself in plenty of trouble during the campaign for not
inhaling marijuana, is unlikely to go that far. </p>

<h2>High and hooked </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p><b>A better understanding of how addictions work could provide
benefits for science, for medicine and for recreation </b></p>

<p>In 1964 Aryeh Routtenberg stuck electrodes into the brains of
his experimental rats. The electrodes were so positioned that
current flowing though them caused a particular pleasure. For one
hour a day, each rat could control this current by means of a
lever in its cage. Another lever, which also worked for just that
one hour, controlled the food supply. There was no contest
between the levers. The rats, too busy mainlining current to stop
for food, wasted away to ecstatic death. </p>

<p>The link between pleasure and addiction is not always so
extreme, but more mundane addictions have brought about millions
of less dramatic deaths outside the laboratory, and caused untold
misery and pain. The substances to which people get addicted,
though, also bring great pleasure to billions--some addicted,
some not. They are the basis of several multi-billion dollar
industries around the world. Some 60m Americans smoke tobacco;
three-quarters of West European adults drink alcohol; no one
knows how many people around the world consume caffeine in tea,
coffee or cola. Figures for illegal drugs are harder to come by,
but around 2m Americans are thought to take cocaine, and many
more than that have smokes marijuana. </p>

<p>Not all the people who indulge in these tastes are
addicts--that is, they do not depend on their habit in a way that
seems clearly abnormal to the bulk of people who do not share
their tastes. Though almost everyone who smokes tobacco is
hooked, drinkers are not necessarily alcoholics and not all
heroin users are hopeless junkies. Pleasure and the addiction
need not come together--either can be present without the other.
yet the two are obviously connected. Neuroscientists are now
using the tools of molecular biology to find the links between
them, deep in the recesses of the brain. </p>

<p><b>The kick from cocaine</b> </p>

<p>The cerebral nooks and crannies of interest are those between
nerve cells--synapses. To jump over the gap between two cells, a
nerve impulse has to be translated from electricity to chemicals
and back. The first cell releases a chemical called a
neurotransmitter into the synaptic gap. These molecules are then
picked up by receptor proteins on the surface of the second cell.
The neurotransmitter fits the receptor as a key fits a lock. The
unlocking of the receptor leads to the creation or suppression of
a nerve impulse in the second cell. </p>

<p>There are many different types of neurotransmitter, and thus
of synapse; different pathways in the brain need their different
properties. It is by subverting some of these synapses, and thus
some of the brain's pathways, that drugs produce pleasure. it is
through changing them in a more fundamental way that the drugs
cause addiction. </p>

<p>The first evidence for this is almost 20 years old. Recently
it has started to pile up quite quickly. In 1975 Solomon Snyder,
at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Hans Kosterlitz of the
University of Aberdeen in Scotland and John Hughes of
Parke-Davis, and English pharmaceuticals company, found out how
heroin, then drug-du-jour for worried policy-makers, works. Dr.
Snyder discovered there was a receptor protein in mammalian
brains which heroin would stick to. Dr. Kosterlitz and Dr. Hughes
reasoned that nature was unlikely to have produced such a lock
without also evolving a key. </p>

<p>Working independently, they found a chemical in the body that
fitted into the same receptor as heroin; Dr. Kosterlitz named it
&quot;endorphin&quot;. This type of neurotransmitter (there are,
it turns out, at least three different endorphins) damps down
pain by suppressing the signals which transmit it; it also
provides feelings of well-being. heroin acts as an ill-fitting
key which can open the lock but cannot then be withdrawn. The
synapse is over-stimulated. Unusually pleasurable sensations
result. </p>

<p>If you replace heroin and endorphins with nicotine and the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine, or with caffeine and adenosine,
or Valium and gamma-amino butyric acid, or marijuana and
anadamide, the same story can be told. Other drugs work in
slightly more subtle ways. Alcohol does not mimic a
neurotransmitter, but at least some of its effects come from
messing up the same synapses that heroin works on. Cocaine, which
has replaced heroin as the drug of concern in America, and has
thus been extensively researched, works on nerves that use the
neurotransmitter dopamine. These nerves are found in, among other
places, the mesolimbic system--the part of the brain which seems
to generate emotion. Cocaine subverts the pathway not by binding
to dopamine receptors, but by sticking to a molecule called,
inelegantly, the dopamine re-uptake transporter. </p>

<p>Nerve cells, canny little things, recycle their
neurtransmitters. Receptor molecules spit out their
neurotransmitters once they have served their purpose, and the
cell whence they came mops them up for reuse. Block this
re-uptake, and the transmitters will just sit in the synaptic
gap, stimulating the receptors again and again and again. Another
strategy is to jam the re-uptake system open, so that dopamine
flows though it the wrong way all the time, keeping the gap
suffused with the neurotransmitter. That is what amphetamines do.
</p>

<p>The fact that amphetamines and cocaine work in similar ways
will come as no surprise to anyone who has tried both. The nature
of the high a drug provides depends on the type of
neurotransmitter it interferes with. but the brain is a complex
place; the separate systems within it that use different
neurotransmitters all interact. A drug acting on one set of
synapses can have secondary and tertiary effects all over the
place. That is why drug experiences are so varied. The range of
things that can be addictive, though, is wider even than the
range of available drugs. Foreign bodies in the synapses are not
an absolute prerequisite for an addiction. Something as
straightforward as healthy exercise can, in the extreme, hook. In
the case of exercise it appears that the body becomes addicted to
the endorphins it produces to ameliorate the pain and stress. </p>

<p>Other behaviours that carry an intensity with them--and thus
presumable overstimulate some parts of the brain's wiring--can
produce similar effects, though the synapses involved have yet to
be charted. Gambling has many of the characteristics of drug
taking--a euphoric high, and a craving in the addict. Some people
believe themselves addicted to sex; lawyers in England recently
convinced a jury that a teenage hacker was addicted to computing.
</p>

<p>It is easy to see some such &quot;addictions&quot; as excuses,
especially as the term resists strict definition. But addiction
to chemicals is clearly real, and there seems no reason to
believe that compulsive chemical-taking is necessarily in a
different class from other acquired compulsive habits. Anyway,
chemical dependency is easier to study than other sorts. That is
why it has been possible to locate the roots of pleasure in the
synapses--and why it has been possible to find the roots of
withdrawal there, too. </p>

<p><b>Cold turkey </b></p>

<p>Clinically, addiction can be characterised by two things:
craving and withdrawal. Craving is still the subject of a certain
amount of scientific handwaving. The best the psychologists can
do is describe the process as one of positive
reinforcement--which means that if you like something, you will
tend to do it again. Having their receptors overstimulated is
something people tend to like a lot. How this &quot;liking&quot;
translates into neural circuitry is not yet clear. </p>

<p>Withdrawal, the physical and mental turmoil that follows when
an addiction is interrupted, is proving more tractable to
experimental analysis. A suggestive picture of how it works can
be pieced together, as long as you do not mind taking the pieces
from different studies of different drugs: work on cocaine by
Nora Volcow at Brookhaven National Laboratory, among others; on
cocaine and amphetamines by Bruce Cohen of McLean Hospital in
Boston; on heroin by Zvi Vogel at the Weizmann Institute in
Rehovot in Israel and Antol Shofelmeer at the Free University in
Amsterdam; an on benzodiazepines (such as Valium) by Erick Sigel
at the University of Berne. </p>

<p>Again, the synapse is the scene of the action. Most biological
systems have feedback mechanisms that help smooth out the little
fluctuations that life throws at them. Synapses are no exception.
The receiving cell can adjust itself to changes in the behaviour
of the transmitting cell in two ways. It can finetune the signal
the receptors pass on, and it can change the number of receptors.
The receptor molecules are conduits for information, with one end
outside the cell and the other inside. When a neurotransmitter
attaches itself outside, the part on the inside changes its
shape. In this new shape, it can accommodate molecules called
G-proteins, which hang around inside the cell. These G-proteins
are, themselves, also shape-changers. Interacting with the
receptor activates the G-proteins; these then head off to spread
the word via yet more molecules, called second messengers. </p>

<p>the second messengers tell the cell about the signal from the
neurotransmitters. One part of the cell that listens is the
system which sends out and suppresses nerve impulses. Another
avid audience is made up of the enzymes which add phosphate
groups to proteins, some of which help in the production of
impulses. More messages make them more active, and more likely to
add phosphate to receptor molecules. A phosphorylated receptor is
an unhappy receptor. It is reluctant to accommodate G-proteins
and thus to bring information in from the outside. The nucleus,
which controls the production of proteins, and also listens to
the second messengers. Lots of chatter from them suggests to the
nucleus that there are too many receptors at the synapse, so it
brings their manufacture to a halt. Insert an addictive drug into
the system and the din from the second messengers becomes
deafening. The result is fewer receptor molecules. Both the
phosphorylation of receptors and their absence means that it
takes more of the drug to obtain the same effect. Those high
doses, in turn, lead to even less sensitive synapses. And they
also lead to synapses that can no longer function without the
drug. The cell gets used to damming the flood of drug-induced
noise in order to be able to deal with the faint whispers of
reality that float on top of it. Remove the drug, and the normal
signals can no longer get over the barrier that has been erected.
The system goes from getting too much of the neurotransmitter's
effects to not enough; heaven turns to hell. </p>

<p>Put this way, the molecular picture seems obvious. It fits
with a common experience of addiction, that of needing to do more
and more of the drug just to keep from feeling bad. Of course, it
cannot be that simple--after all drugs that work on the same
neurotransmitter may vary in their addictiveness. And people
vary, too, in their susceptibility to addiction. Then again,
addictions to substances that affect different types of synapse
can be quite similar--and some people seem to be prone to
addiction per se, rather than just to have a weakness for a
particular substance. And the fact that addiction remains after
withdrawal has ended--a fact attested to at Alcoholics Anonymous
every day--suggests there is a more general problem to look at. </p>

<p><b>Dopamine heads</b> </p>

<p>For more evidence that addictions have something in common in
the way they act on the brain as a whole, no matter which
pathways they stimulate, look at the pictures on this page. </p>

<p>Edythe London, who works at America's National Institute on
Drug Abuse, studies glucose metabolism in the brains of people
with addictions. Glucose is the body's principal fuel, so its use
is a good index of how active an area is. Dr London's pictures
show that, in certain parts of the brain, addicts use less
glucose than non-addicts do. The difference applies regardless of
what drug is being used, and it is still visible when they are
not under the influence. </p>

<p>Other clues to a general theory of addiction have led
researchers to focus on the dopamine system--even when looking at
drugs which do not affect dopamine receptors. There is evidence
that many, and possibly all, addictions affect the dopamine cells
in the brain's mesolimbic system. In the case of cocaine this
effect is direct, which may account for the drug's peculiar
potency. for other drugs it seems to be indirect, brought about
by connections between the dopamine system and the other
neurotransmitter systems. </p>

<p>Inside the dopamine system, the researchers' attention has
lighted on D2. it should come as no surprise by now to hear that
D2 is a protein found in synapses, one of the three different
receptor proteins for dopamine. The detailed make-up of these
proteins can vary from person to person--variation that comes
from differences in the gene which describes the protein. So the
different variants of D2 are inherited. </p>

<p>It was inheritance that led the researchers to D2. In the
1970s a series of Danish studies compared the children and
step-children of alcoholic fathers. The former proved more likely
to succumb to the same addiction. This, and the evidence that
identical twins are more likely to share an alcoholic fate than
are non-identical twins, suggested that genes were playing a
role. In 1990, to great excitement, Kenneth Blum of the
University of Texas at San Antonio, and Ernest Noble of the
University of California, Los Angeles, announced that they had
found a gene peculiarly common among alcoholics. It described a
form of the D2 receptor known as A1. </p>

<p>This was challenged by several researchers, most notably
Kenneth Kidd, of Yale. Dr. Kidd points out that different ethnic
groups have different frequencies of A1, which could confuse the
statistics. Others, convinced by Dr. Blum, Dr. Noble and
subsequent work, have suggested that A1 frequencies may actually
explain differences in alcoholism between ethnic groups, though
this is far from certain. In 1992 George Uhl, of Johns Hopkins,
found that a second variant of D2, known as B1, seemed peculiarly
common in people addicted to tobacco, cocaine, heroin,
tranquillizers, marijuana and amphetamines as well as
alcohol--almost the whole list of commonly addictive substances.
This is at least as controversial as the original finding; its
meaning is not clear, nor is the nature of the difference between
the different D2s. </p>

<p>To link small variations in a single protein with the
existence of an all-purpose &quot;addictive personality&quot; is
to go a long way too far. But there is evidence in one case for a
link between personality and withdrawal symptoms--and to link
withdrawal symptoms to specific molecules is not too farfetched.
About 40% of people prescribed courses of benzodiazepines to
treat anxiety or insomnia can suffer some withdrawal
symptoms--souped-up versions of the symptoms the drugs are used
to treat--after the course of medication is finished. Peter
Tyrer, who worked at St. Charles' Hospital in London, has found
that the people who suffer withdrawal share not a specific
protein, but rather specific personality traits: insecurity,
inability to make decisions, an over-reliance on the opinions of
others. Spot them, and you can save people from withdrawal. </p>

<p><b>Better living through chemistry</b> </p>

<p>The links between proteins, the lowly building blocks of the
brain, and personalities, the high abstractions of the mind, are
undoubtedly going to be convoluted--but evidence from both ends
suggests they are there to be found. What are the pharmaceutical
companies, to which this should be of interest, doing about it? </p>

<p>Some work is going into drugs to treat drug addiction.
Naltrexone keeps heroin from activating endorphin receptors,
without activating them itself. Methadone works in the same way
as heroin, but less effectively; it thus provides a way off
heroin that minimises withdrawal symptoms. Similar approaches to
cocaine are being tried. Drugs which act on dopamine pathways in
general may have widespread effects on addiction. </p>

<p>but drugs to defeat dependence are not the only possibilities.
Some of the damage that comes from drug addiction, especially the
physical damage, comes from secondary aspects of the drug. Lung
cancer, for examples, is caused by the substances that accompany
nicotine in tobacco smoke, not by nicotine itself. It might be
possible to get rid of some of these problems without getting rid
of the pleasure, even if it is not possible to get rid of the
addictions. Another option is to develop tests which could tell
people if they were at risk of falling under a particular spell
so that they could choose their pleasures wisely. </p>

<p>Eventually, an understanding of neurotransmitters, receptors,
G-proteins, and second messengers might allow pleasure and
addiction to be decoupled--or at least allow withdrawal to be
suppressed. Though, on the face of it, the effects that cause
pleasure in the short term are those that cause addiction in the
long term, there is a lot of variability in the system that might
be exploited. Techniques like those used to target specific
dopamine receptors in the treatment of Parkinson's disease,
might, at least in principle, be used to fine tune a drug's
effects at the synapse and produce low-addiction highs. And pure
substances tailored to neurotransmitter sites would have a good
chance of being free of unpleasant side effects elsewhere in the
body. That would not create a brave new world; it might, perhaps,
create a slightly happier one. <br>

<h1>ABC News WAR ON DRUGS: </h1>

<h2>SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS: A Summary </h2>

<p>This is a summary of the major points of the show, as written
by Jim Hoffman </p>

<hr>

<p>On Thursday evening (Apr 6, 1995) ABC news aired the special
report: WAR ON DRUGS: SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS, which explored
harm reduction policy alternatives to the 'WAR ON DRUGS' as
practiced in the United States. </p>

<p>Although limited in scope -- the only drugs mentioned were
heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, and marijuana, with the focus being
on heroin -- I found the quality of the show very encouraging. </p>

<p>I encourage everyone to contact ABC News and commend them for
airing this special. For those who missed it, I have provided a
synopsis below. </p>

<p>Note: quotes are not necessarily verbatim; Names may be
misspelled. </p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ </p>

<p>AMERICA'S WAR ON DRUGS: SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS: A SUMMARY </p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ </p>

<p>STATED PURPOSE: </p>

<p>The claimed purpose of the show was 'not to advocate specific
policy' but to 'open up the discussion' and consider new
approaches, as this issue 'deserves debate'. It advised viewers
not to dismiss approaches just because they seem too radical. </p>

<p>TOPIC: </p>

<p>The show focused on those approaches to the drug problem known
as 'harm reduction'. Although marijuana was touched on several
times, the focus was on 'hard drugs' such as heroin. </p>

<p>FORMAT: </p>

<p>The show was composed primarily of excerpts of interviews with
various people, primarily advocates of harm reduction, stitched
together with narrative by Catherine Cryer and footage of police
raids, prisons, people shooting drugs, etc. </p>

<p>It is sprinkled with assertions by drug war zealot
extraordinaire William Bennet, </p>

<p>which are in most cases followed by refutations which look
much more reasoned. </p>

<p>SUMMARY: </p>

<p>The show opened with some observations: </p>

<p>* We are losing the 'War on Drugs'. </p>

<p>* There is a striking lack of public debate about alternatives
to current policies. </p>

<p>* The crime problem cannot be addressed without addressing the
drug problem. </p>

<p>and some facts: </p>

<p>* The 'War on Drugs' is the longest running war in US history.
</p>

<p>* Over 300,000 people are in prison for drug law violations. </p>

<p>* There are as many illegal drugs on the streets today as
ever. </p>

<p>It then interviewed Jim Montgomery, a paraplegic who was
sentenced to life imprisonment for 2 ounces of cannabis (later
reduced to 10 years) in Oklahoma. (He had no prior criminal
record.) He smokes marijuana to relieve the pain of his broken
back. </p>

<p>It quotes his attorney pointing out that violent offenders are
released from jail to make room for people like Jim Montgomery. </p>

<p>Next, three influential advocates of harm reduction in the USA
are introduced: </p>

<p>Conservative California Judge James Gray: </p>

<p>* declares the War on Drugs has turned into a war on our
people. </p>

<p>* points out nothing is accomplished by imprisoning drug
users. </p>

<p>* favors government regulated distribution of drugs coupled
with education. </p>

<p>Baltimore mayor Kurt Shmoke: </p>

<p>* points out violence in the drug trade is caused by profits,
not by drugs themselves. </p>

<p>* advocates taking the profit out of drug distribution,
through government distribution and a focus on education and
treatment. </p>

<p>* points out only 20% of addicts can get treatment. </p>

<p>New Haven police chief Nick Pastor: </p>

<p>* is shown interacting with inner-city youth talking about
drugs. </p>

<p>William Bennet summarizes the prohibitionist mindset: </p>

<p>'You will never persuade the citizens of this country that
drugs should be legalized.' 'It (drug use) is a deadly and
poisonous activity.' 'We must never admit defeat in the war on
drugs.' 'People should be imprisoned for long periods of time for
using drugs.' </p>

<p>Next it moves to Europe and looks at the experiences with harm
reduction in </p>

<p>Holland and Britain. </p>

<p>Holland </p>

<p>* Use of cannabis is tolerated (scenes of people smoking up in
coffee shops). </p>

<p>* Tolerance of cannabis is attributed for the prevention of
the use of hard drugs by youth. </p>

<p>* A large proportion of crime is caused by foreign tourists
comming from countries with more repressive drug policies. </p>

<p>* Prosecution is reserved for large distributors, not users of
even hard drugs. </p>

<p>* Since free needle exchanges were introduced the HIV
infection rate among IV drug users dropped from 11% to 4%, now
one of lowest in world. </p>

<p>* Public policy seeks to keep addicts healthy, productive
citizens. </p>

<p>* There is still a black market in hard drugs, which many
believe will not be eliminated until complete legalization is
implemented. </p>

<p>* Holland is pressured by the US to roll back its harm
reduction policy. </p>

<p>Britain </p>

<p>* Heroin maintenance, which seeks to stabilize and help
addicts by providing pharmaceutical heroin, is practiced. </p>

<p>* The physical health of junkies is ruined by adulterants in
illicit heroin. </p>

<p>(Pharmaceutical heroin can be used lifelong without medical
consequences.) </p>

<p>* People on heroin maintenance are able to lead relatively
normal healthy lives. </p>

<p>* If given a chance, most people mature out of addiction, so
heroin maintenance </p>

<p>buys time, allowing the user to build a life as an alternative
to addiction. </p>

<p>* A 15-fold reduction in crimes by addicts on heroin
maintenance has been documented. </p>

<p>* Many on heroin maintenance are eventually successful in
kicking the addiction. </p>

<p>Back to the USA ... </p>

<p>treatment: </p>

<p>* America's lack of commitment to treatment is highlighted. </p>

<p>* The success rate of treatment (American style) is at best
25%. </p>

<p>AIDS infection </p>

<p>* Ethen Nadelman, a harm reduction proponent, questions the
morality of policies </p>

<p>which result in IV drug users getting HIV, perhaps infecting
their lovers and children, and producing a huge economic burden
on society. </p>

<p>* A study of the effectiveness of needle exchange programs in
New York shows a drop in HIV infection among IV drug users from
6% to 2%. </p>

<p>Marijuana </p>

<p>* Dr. Lester Grinspoon, (author of Marijuana Forbidden
Medicine (not mentioned)) </p>

<p>dispels gateway theory of cannabis. He says cannabis is 'less
of a problem than tobacco or alcohol by orders of magnitude'. </p>

<p>* US Government reports dispel gateway theory. </p>

<p>* The 1972 Schafer Commission, appointed by Richard Nixon,
recommends the legalization of the possession and sale of small
quantities of cannabis. </p>

<p>* The partial adoption of this strategy in California saved
billions of dollars. </p>

<p>* The nation's leaders purposely ignore findings of Schafer
Commission. </p>

<p>William Bennet again </p>

<p>'law enforcement is very effective prevention' </p>

<p>'harm reduction policies would immediately lead to 50 million
hard drug users </p>

<p>in the USA' </p>

<p>* These assertions are both made to look rather dubious by
subsequent rebuttals. </p>

<p>Drugs and children </p>

<p>* PDFA commercials initially had &quot;great impact&quot; in
discouraging drug use. </p>

<p>* The lack of education has recently led to increased use
among kids. </p>

<p>(These two points I take issue with, as I attribute the
increase to a loss </p>

<p>of credibility brought about by exaggeration in 'drug
education'.) </p>

<p>* Due to prohibition there are pushers in schools - drugs are
readily available </p>

<p>in spite of (or because of) prohibition. </p>

<p>Memorable metaphor </p>

<p>Kurt Shmoke describes the drug war as a 'domestic Vietnam'. <br>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, the author says, morphine taken
solely to control pain is not addictive. Yet patients worldwide
continue to be undertreated and to suffer unnecessary agony </p>

<p><b>by Ronald Melzack</b></p>

<hr>

<p>RONALD MELZACK, who has been studying the neurophysiology of
pain for 35 years, is E. P. Taylor Professor of Psychology at
McGill University and research director of the Pain Clinic at the
Montreal General Hospital. After earning a Ph.D. in psychology
from McGill in 19S4 and accepting fellowships in the U.S. and
abroad, he joined the faculty of the Massachusetts institute of
Technology in 19S9. There, he and Patrick D. Wall began
discussions that led to the 196S publication of their now famous
,gate control&quot; theory of pain. He returned to McGill in
1963. This is his <u>third article for </u><i>Scientific
American. </i></p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;Pain&quot; as Albert Schweitzer once said, &quot;is a
more terrible lord of mankind than even death itself.&quot;
Prolonged pain destroys the quality of life. It can erode the
will to live, at times driving people to suicide. The physical
effects are equally profound. Severe, persistent pain can impair
sleep and appetite, thereby producing fatigue and reducing the
availability of nutrients to organs. It may thus impede recovery
from illness or injury and, in weakened or elderly patients, may
make the difference between life and death. </p>

<p>Sadly, there are some kinds of pain that existing treatments
cannot ease. That care givers can do little in these cases is
terribly distressing for everyone involved but is certainly
understandable. What seems less understandable is that many
people suffer not because their discomfort is untreatable but
because physicians are often reluctant to prescribe morphine.
Morphine is the safest, most effective analgesic (painkiller)
known for constant, severe pain, but it is also addictive for
some people. Consequently, it is typically meted out sparingly,
if it is given at all. </p>

<p>Indeed, concern over addiction has led many nations in Europe
and elsewhere to outlaw virtually any uses Of morphine and
related substances, including their medical applications. Ever
where morphine is a legal medical therapy, as it is in Great
Britain and the U.S., many care givers, afraid of turning
patients into addicts, deliver amounts that are too small or
spaced too widely to control pain. </p>

<p>'Yet the fact is that when patients take morphine to combat
pain, it is rare to see addiction-which is characterized by a
psychological craving for a substance and, when the substance is
suddenly removed, by the development of withdrawal symptoms (for
example, sweating, aches and nausea). Addiction seems to arise
only in some fraction of morphine users who take the drug for its
psychological effects, such as its ability to produce euphoria
and relieve tension. </p>

<p>Furthermore, patients who take morphine for pain do not
develop the rapid physical tolerance to the drug that is often a
sign of addiction. Many people who are prone to addiction quickly
require markedly escalating doses to achieve a desired change of
mood, but patients who take the drug to control pain do not need
sharply rising doses for relief. They may develop some tolerance
initially, but their required dose usually rises gradually and
then stabilizes. </p>

<p>I do not suggest that morphine be prescribed indiscriminately.
I do urge lawmakers, law-enforcement agencies and health-care
workers to distinguish between the addict who craves morphine for
its mood-altering properties and the psychologically healthy
patient who takes the drug only to relieve pain. </p>

<p>Morphine is a constituent of opium, which has been a medical
therapy for longer than 2,000 years, since at least ancient Roman
times. Opium is made by extracting a milky juice from the unripe
capsule, or seedpod, of the poppy <i>Papaver somniferum </i>(grown
abundantly in many Middle Eastern countries) and then drying the
exudate to form a gum. This gum-the opium-can be eaten as is or
added to a beverage. </p>

<p>By the 16th century opium was being carried by traders to
Europe and the Orient. At about that time an opium-containing
mixture called laudanum became a popular remedy in Europe for
virtually all ailments. Later, smoking opium and tobacco together
became yet another popular way to obtain the drug's benefits. </p>

<p>Soon after the turn of the 19th century, a young German
pharmacist named Friedrich W. A. Serttimer isolated morphine from
opium and identified it as opium's major active ingredient.
Morphine's production was followed in 1832 by the isolation of
yet another opiate, or opium derivative: codeine. </p>

<p>In the mid-19th century the introduction of the hypodermic
needle made it possible to administer large amounts of drugs by
injection. The standard approach to morphine therapy for ongoing
pain (left) calls for injections pro re nata (PRN), or &quot;as
needed.' In practice this means injections are given only in
response to pain; also, if the pain returns before four to six
hours have passed the patient often has to wait for help. By the
time the next injection is delivered, the pain may be so severe
that quite a large dose is needed, leading to mental clouding and
other side effects, such as nausea. A more enlightened approach
(right) seeks the actual prevention of pain and thus helps ease
the fear of recurring agony. The morphine is given orally (in a
dose tailored to the patient's needs) every four hours or even
more frequently if a shorter schedule prevents pain more
effectively. Because the doses are frequent, they typically can
be relatively low, which reduces the incidence of side effects. </p>

<p>Improved technology, which enabled a drug's effects to be felt
quickly, led in many regions of the world to the ready
prescription of injected morphine for severe pain. At the same
time, more and more people began taking morphine for its
emotional<b> </b>effects, and the number of addicts rose. </p>

<p>Eventually a search began for drugs that had morphine's
analgesic properties but were not habit-forming. This quest
resulted in the production of heroin, a synthetic compound
similar in activity to morphine but soon found, disappointingly,
to be quite as addictive. Various other opioids (chemicals with
activity similar to that of opium) were then introduced,
including methadone and meperidine (Demerol). Like the opiates,
many of the opioids relieve pain, induce changes in mood and,
unfortunately, are addictive to some extent. </p>

<p>Inevitably, the rising abuse of narcotics (by which I mean
opiates and opioids) and of other mood-altering drugs spurred
countries throughout the world to adopt antidrug regulations. At
the same time, the extremely cautious administration of narcotics
for pain became commonplace. </p>

<p>Today morphine therapy for pain is generally restricted to two
groups of patients. It is prescribed over relatively short
periods for hospitalized individuals who have discomfort caused
by surgical incisions, and it is given over potentially longer
periods to ameliorate the pain suffered by burn victims or people
who have incurable cancer. </p>

<p>In many hospitals the standard prescription order says
&quot;PRN&quot; (pro re nata, or &quot;as needed&quot;). This
order essentially means that the drug is given orLiy after pain
returns. Typically, it is delivered by injection into a muscle or
under the skirt. </p>

<p>The result of the PRN approach is often a confrontation
between the patient and the care giver, who expects morphine
analgesia to last for four to six hours. The patient, whose pain
has returned earlier than expected, is in agony and pleads to
have the next injection. The health-care worker, fearful of
causing addiction, refuses to comply. When the pain is finally
treated, it may be so severe that a large dose has to be given,
which increases the likelihood of side effects, such as mental
clouding and nausea. Particularly when a patient has a terminal
Illness, the issue of addiction is meaningless, and delaying
relief is cruel. </p>

<p>There is another, more humane way to treat pain, one that is
slowly gaining acceptance. In this approach doses are given
regularly, according to a schedule that has been actually
tailored to prevent recurrence of the individual's pain. Thus,
pain is controlled continuously; a patient does not wait for
discomfort to return before receiving the next dose. </p>

<p>This enlightened, preventive approach evolved from pioneering
work first undertaken some 20 years ago by Cicely M. Saunders, an
English physician who established the first modern center devoted
to caring for people who are dying of cancer or other dis. eases:
St. Christopher's Hospice in London. Saunders urged physicians
caring for terminally ill Patents to face reality and palliate-to
relieve Pain, nausea and other discomforts instead of making
futile attempts to cure disease. The final days or weeks of a
person's life, she believed, should be a time of peace and
comfort, spent as pleasurably as possible in the company of
family and friends. </p>

<p>To achieve this aim, Saunders prescribed the Brompton mixture,
a version of a liquid analgesic that had been used for advanced
cancer by several London hospitals, including the Brompton Chest
Hospital, since the late 19th century. The mixture (made of
morphine, cocaine, chloroform water, alcohol and flavoring syrup)
had been eclipsed by injectable morphine, but Saunders realized
that an orally delivered compound would allow many patients to
spend a number of their last days at home; a visiting nurse would
simply monitor them, making sure their pain was controlled.<br>
</p>

<p><img src="sa100001.gif" align="bottom" width="672"
height="248"> </p>

<p>Morphine has since been found to be the only important
ingredient in the Brompton mixture, and so today patients who are
treated with the preventive approach to pain take morphine alone,
either as a tablet or mixed into a beverage. An initial dose of
10 milligrams is typically given and repeated every four hours.
Then, over the course of perhaps several days or weeks, the dose
and timing are adjusted until a maintenance regimen is
established that controls pain around the clock without producing
mental clouding and other side effects. </p>

<p>For patients who have cancer, an approach emphasizing pain
prevention is particularly wise. Pain and the fear of pain are
perhaps their greatest source of suffering. In the early stages
of the disease, some 80 percent of people have pain resulting
from the cancer itself or from the procedures designed to arrest
its spread. By the time the cancer has reached its final stages,
about 70 percent of people report pain, which tends to be intense
and persistent. </p>

<p>About 80 to 90 percent of cancer patients treated with the
preventive approach obtain satisfactory relief, reporting that
their discomfort is consistently bearable or, more frequently,
gone. Roughly half of the remainder obtain relief with the
addition of other therapies. This success rate is remarkable in
view of the destructiveness of cancer and the severity of the
pain associated with it. </p>

<p>Treatments continue to improve. There are now special capsules
that release morphine slowly and so need to be taken only a few
times a day. Also available are electronically controlled,
portable pumps that deliver a steady infusion of medication under
the skin. </p>

<p>Enough evidence has now been collected to demonstrate that the
traditional, PRN approach, based as it is on the fear of
addiction makes little sense. Study after study of patients whose
pain is most often treated with narcotics-namely, cancer
patients, bum victims and those hospitalized for surgery-has
shown that the patients who develop rapid and marked tolerance
to, and dependence on, the narcotics are usually those who
already have a history of psychological disturbance or substance
abuse. </p>

<p>Let us first consider the problem of marked tolerance, which
not only is a sign of possible addiction but is also a medical
concern in its own right because the risk of side effects
increases as the dose increases. For instance, delivery of
extremely large amounts of morphine can induce coma and seriously
impair respiration. </p>

<p>Robert G. Twycross, now at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford,
England, has shown that relatively little tolerance develops in
patients with cancer lvh( take individually adjusted doses of
heroin several times a day over long Periods. The patients
developed some tolerance to the drug initially, so that the doses
had to be gradually raised over the first 12 weeks, but pain
relief was achieved without producing serious side effects. Then
the doses held fairly stable for months. </p>

<p>Balfour M. Mount, one of my colleagues at McGill University,
and I recently found similar results when we studied tolerance to
morphine in patients who spent more than a month in the
Palliative Care Unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal.
(This unit, established by Mount, was the first service for
palliative care at a large general hospital.) The patients in our
study, who took the drug by mouth answered a pain-evaluating
questionnaire that I developed with Warren S. Torgerson of Johns
Hopkins University. The overall intensity of the pain was ranked
on a scale ranging from no pain (0) to pain that is mild <b>(1). </b>Discomfort
(2). distressing (3), horrible (4) or excruciating (5). </p>

<p>About 5 percent of the patients had persistently high pain
levels (3 or higher). The remaining 95 percent had excellent pain
control without requiring rapidly escalating amounts of morphine.
Increase in pain, usually a sign of disease progression after a
maintenance program has been established, was<b> </b>the most
common. reason for a rise in dose. Patients who found that their
discomfort had decreased either spontaneously or because of
treatment, such as reduction of a tumor by radiation-usually
required less medication </p>

<p>John F. Scott of the Elizabeth Bruyere Health Center in Ottawa
also uncovered little evidence of addiction when he analyzed many
studies examining withdrawal symptoms in patients at
cancer-treatment clinics. He reports that &quot;if a cancer
patient no longer requires a narcotic for pain control, a gradual
reduction in dose will prevent any withdrawal symptoms, although
these are usually mild or absent even after abrupt
discontinuance.&quot; Any physical dependence is generally
overcome without difficulty when doses are reduced over a period
of days. </p>

<hr>

<p>FORMALIN TEST measures the analgesic (painkilling) effects of
medications on so-called tonic, or persistent pain. A dilute
solution of formaldehyde and saline is injected under the skin of
a rat's paw, inducing pain that lasts for about 90 minutes. The
rat licks its paw repeatedly, which is a sign of moderate pain (a
pain rating of 3). Then. after a while, the animal holds the paw
in the air (a rating of 2), steps on it gingerly (a rating of 1)
and finally walks normally (a rating of 0). In this test, rats
treated with morphine develop little tolerance to the drug's
analgesic effect; that is, they do not require ever-increasing
doses to obtain relief. This finding is consistent with the
results of clinical studies showing that patients who take
morphine for persistent pain do not acquire marked tolerance and
do not become addicted.<br>
</p>

<p><img src="sa100002.gif" align="bottom" width="438"

<hr>

<p>Studies of patients who received narcotics while they were
hospitalized have also uncovered little evidence of addiction. In
an extensive study Jane B. Porter and Hershel Jick of the Boston
University Medical Center followed up on 11,882 patients who were
given narcotics to relieve pain stemming from various medical
problems; none of the subjects had a history of drug dependence.
The team found that only four of the patients subsequently abused
drugs, and in only one case was the abuse considered major. </p>

<p>Equally persuasive are the results of a survey of more than
10,000 burn victims. These individuals, who were studied by
Samuel W. Perry of New York Hospital and George Heidrich of the
University of Wisconsin at Madisom underwent debridement, an
extremely painful procedure in which the dead tissue is removed
from burned skin. Most of the patients received injections of
narcotics for weeks or even months. Yet not a single case of
later addiction could be attributed to the narcotics given for
pain relief during the hospital stay. Although 22 patients abused
drugs after they were discharged, all of them had a history of
drug abuse. </p>

<p>Further evidence that narcotic drugs can be administered for
pain without causing addiction comes from studies of
&quot;patient-controlled analgesia&quot; in surgical patients and
those hospitalized for bums. in such studies patients push a
button on an electronically controlled pump at the bedside to
give themselves small doses of morphine (through an intravenous
tube). When these devices were introduced, there was considerable
fear that patients would abuse the drug. Instead it soon became
clear that patients maintain their doses at a reasonable level
and decrease them when their pain diminishes. </p>

<p>Studies that explore how morphine produces analgesia are
helping to explain why patients who take the drug solely to
relieve pain are unlikely to develop rapid tolerance and become
addicted. On the basis of such studies, my former student Frances
V. Abbott and I proposed in 1981 that morphine probably has an
effect on two distinct pain-signaling systems in the central
nervous system and that one of these-which gives rise to the kind
of pain typically treated with morphine-does not develop much
tolerance to the drug. </p>

<p>Our proposal grew out of my efforts to develop a test in
animals that would accurately determine the effectiveness of
analgesic drugs on the kind of pain most often requiring
narcotics in human patients: the prolonged, or &quot;tonic,&quot;
kind that persists long after an injury is suffered. This is the
sort of pain that chronically bedevils cancer patients. When an
injury first occurs, it gives rise to what is called phasic pain,
which is brief and rapidly rises and falls in intensity. (The
pain felt the instant a finger is cut would be called phasic.)
Such phasic pain is usually followed by the tonic kind. </p>

<p>For many years investigators interested in measuring the
analgesic effects of drugs subjected rats to what is called the
tail-flick test. After a rat is injected with a test drug, its
tail is immersed in hot water; the time between immersion and
when the rat flicks its tail out of the water is measured as an
index of pain. When morphine's effectiveness was examined with
this test, investigators repeatedly found evidence of marked
tolerance: the animals required ever-increasing doses in order to
keep the tail in the water for a given time. Such results were
interpreted to mean that human patients in pain would readily
become tolerant to morphine and so would become addicted to the
drug. </p>

<p>There is a major problem with the tail-flick test, however. It
gives rise to suddenly rising, phasic pain, which is not the kind
for which morphine is usually prescribed. To gain more
information about the effects of analgesics on persistent, tonic
pain in humans, John O'Keefe, David Dubuisson and Stephen G.
Dennis, who were then my students, developed what is called the
formalin test. A small amount of formalin-formaldehyde diluted in
saline-is injected under the s1cin of a rat's forepaw. When the
animal is not given an analgesic, the formalin produces moderate
pain that lasts for about 90 minutes, as evinced by the animal's
tendency to lick the paw and a reluctance to put weight on it. If
a drug soothes the hurt, the animal puts weight on the paw more
quickly. </p>

<p>With the formalin (tonic-pain) test, Abbott and I (later
joined at McGill by our colleague Keith B. J. Franklin)
discovered that rats developed relatively little tolerance to the
analgesia produced by successive injections of morphine. The most
logical explanation for the different degrees of tolerance found
in the tail-flick and formalin tests was that phasic and tonic
pain are invoked by two distinct neural systems that have
differing tolerance to morphine. </p>

<p>Other lines of evidence added support to this idea. For
instance, Dennis and I examined the effect on pain of several
drugs that interact with morphine (or that alter pain in their
own right) in both the tail-flick and the formalin tests. The
results were striking. Drug effects that we found in One test
were absent or even reversed in the other. For example, drugs
that reduced morphine analgesia in one test either had no effect
or enhanced the analgesic effect in the other test. if the neural
systems that respond to phasic and tonic pain were one and the
same, the effects of the drugs on morphine's activity should have
been identical in both tests. </p>

<p>My colleagues and I think we now know which of the many neural
pathways in the spinal cord and brain constitute the two
pain-signaling systems that are sensitive to morphine. We also
know something about their functioning and how they are affected
by morphine. In both systems, information about pain is delivered
to the dorsal horns (wingshaped regions) of the spinal cord by
peripheral neurons emanating from the skin and other body tissues
[see <i>illustration on opposite page]. </i>Ascending neurons
originating in the dorsal horns then relay the pain signals
upward through the spinal cord to various parts of the brain. </p>

<p>The pain-signaling system that my colleague and I think is
most associated with sudden, phasic pain is called the lateral
system. The name derives from the simple fact that the system's
tracts, which project to the sensory cortex, pass through the
brain stem at a position to the side of the brain stem's central
core. The system that is probably responsible for persistent,
tonic pain is called the medial system; its tracts pass through
the central core of the brain stem. </p>

<p>Among the more salient properties of the lateral system are
the rapid conduction of impulses and an organization that maps
the relative position of body sites. These properties would
enable the system to give rise to sudden, sharp pain in a readily
identified spot in the body. Kenneth L. Casey of the University
of Michigan at Ann Arbor and I have proposed that the lateral
tracts also account to a great extent for the sensory qualities
of pains, such as throbbing or burning. </p>

<p>The activity of the lateral system is apparently dampened
rather quickly, which would' explain why phasic pain often
subsides promptly. The inhibition is accomplished by a system of
neurons that originates in what is called the periaqueductal gray
matter in the part of the brain stem known as the midbrain. This
descending system sends signals downward to the dorsal horns,
where it inhibits the transmission of pain signals from the
peripheral nerves to ascending tracts. After an injury, it is
apparently activated by the body's own optoids (enclorphins and
enkephalins). if, as we suggest, the lateral system carries the
signals that give rise to sudden phasic pain, then it is not
surprising that the system is naturally subject to powerful
inhibition. Sudden pain from a newly acquired injury could well
overwhelm an animal, preventing it from fighting, running for
cover or burrowing to escape a predator during an emergency. </p>

<p>The other pain-signaling system the medial system-differs from
the lateral system in many ways. For example, a number of its
tracts send impulses to the limbic system which comprises the
subcortical regions of the brain involved in motivation and
affect. Hence, we think the medial system controls the emotional
component of pain, producing qualities one might describe as
wretched, terrifying, vicious and the like. The system also
influences the actions one takes in response to such feelings. </p>

<p>Because the medial system conducts signals relatively slowly
through many small neurons, it is not well suited for providing
precise information during emergencies. Instead it is more suited
for producing diffuse, unpleasant feelings for some time after an
injury has occurred. Such feelings would help ensure that, having
survived an immediate threat, a wounded individual would feel
miserable and so remain inactive long enough to heal. </p>

<p>Where does morphine exert its effects? In both the lateral
(phasic-pain) and the medial (tonic-pain) systems,morphine
clearly has some direct effect at the dorsal horns. It is also
well known that morphine can activate the descending inhibitory
system originating in the periaqueductal gray matter. Abbott and
others in my laboratory have found that this descending system
has a greater impact on the lateral system than on the medial
system, which suggests that much of morphine's power over sudden,
phasic pain is mediated by the descending neural tracts. </p>

<hr>

<p>TWO SYSTEMS of neurons evoke pain: a medial system (pink),
which passes through the central core of the brain stem, and a
lateral system <i>(orange). </i>Both are bilateral, consist of
several tracts and relay to higher centers the pain signals that
come into the dorsal horns of the spinal cord. The medial system
Is thought to be most responsible for persistent (tonic) pain.
Because it sends signals to the limbic system of the brain, Which
influences emotions, it is also believed to give rise to the
affective component of pain (reflected by such descriptions as ft
frightful&quot; or &quot;cruel&quot;). The lateral system is
thought to be most active during phasic pain, which is sudden and
sharp. Because it sends signals to the sensory cortex, it
probably gives rise to such sensations as cramping or stinging.
Morphine can inhibit both systems, but the medial (tonic-pain)
system develops much less tolerance to the drug's analgesic
effects than does the lateral (phasic-pain) system-which may
explain why patients who take morphine for persistent (tonic)
pain do not develop great tolerance to it. Morphine produces
analgesia in part by inhibiting the flow of pain signals from the
peripheral nerves to the ascending pathways; it acts directly at
the dorsal horns and also activates a descending inhibitory
system (blue) that originates in the midbrain. Morphine also acts
at sites above the periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain,
including the limbic system and the habenula. which has strong
links to both the medial and Umbic systems. Such activity
apparently contributes to the drug's analgesic effect on
persistent pain. <br>
</p>

<p><img src="sa100004.gif" align="bottom" width="229"
height="232"> </p>

<hr>

<p>Morphine's analgesic activity certainly is not confined to the
dorsal horns and the midbrain. For instance, strong evidence
indicates that morphine acts on the limbic system, which is known
to play a major role in both pain and pleasure. Such activity
could well dampen the pain sensations produced by the medial
(tonic-pain) system, which sends a great many impulses to the
limbic system. </p>

<p>A recent study by S. Robin Cohen, my student, and myself lends
additional support to the idea that morphine's influence over the
medial system derives in part from activity above the midbrain.
We injected morphine into the habenula, a small region of the
brain (just behind the thalamus) that has strong links with the
limbic system and a part of the medial system in the midbrain.
The injections produced analgesia in the formalin test but not in
the foot-flick test (similar to the tail-flick test), which
suggests that morphine acts at the habenula and that, when it
does, it inhibits the medial but not the lateral system. </p>

<p>This finding and others indicate that more research should be
devoted to areas above the midbrain if investigators are to gain
a fuller understanding of how morphine eases persistent, tonic
pain without inducing tolerance to repeated doses of the drug. </p>

<p>In view of the complexity of the neural mechanisms of pain, it
is not surprising that morphine's ability to produce analgesia
has been found to vary greatly from person to person. An
important message emerging from studies of such variation is that
the need for a high dose is not necessarily a sign of addiction. </p>

<p>In one such study involving cancer patients, Robert Kaiko, now
at the Purdue Frederick Company in Norwalk, Conn., and Ws
colleagues at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center found
that to achieve a given level of analgesia, less morphine was
needed by older patients than by younger patients, and less was
needed by blacks than by whites. Similarly, patients with dull
pain needed less morphine than did those with sharp pain, and
patients with stomach pain needed less morphine than did patients
with pain in the chest or arm. </p>

<p>Genetic factors might also influence an individual's response
to the analgesic power of narcotics, as Anthony L. Vaccarino (my
student), R. Andrew R. Tasker, now at the University of Prince
Edward Island, and I learned recently when we examined the
effects of morphine and its antagonist naloxone in a strain of
mice specially bred for studies of immunologic function we
unexpectedly found that the &quot;antagonist&quot; actually
enhanced morphine analgesia and produced analgesia on its own in
rats subjected to the formahn test. These surprising findings,
which so far have been documented only for this strain of mice,
are clearly the result of a genetic anomaly. </p>

<p>The discovery of a genetic influence on morphine's actions
raises the possibility that susceptibility to addiction might
also have a genetic component in some people. Evidence collected
by other groups is consistent with. that idea, although little
work addresses the problem directly. </p>

<p>There is no way to identify patients who might be genetically
predisposed to morphine addiction, but I must emphasize again
that a person's psychological history is indicative of risk. More
than 50 percent of narcotics abusers have had bouts of major
depression, and 87 percent have a history of psychiatric
disorder. </p>

<p>Society's failure to distinguish between the emotionally
impaired addict and the psychologically healthy pain sufferer has
affected every segment of the population. Perhaps the most
distressing example is unnecessary pain in children Many
health-care workers undertreat pain in youngsters, not only
because of fear of addiction but also because of the mistaken
belief that young children do not feel pain as intensely as
adults. In a classic study, Joann M. Eland and Jane E. Anderson
of the University of Iowa found in 1977 that more than half of
the children from four to eight years old who underwent major
surgery-including limb amputation, excision of a cancerous neck
mass and heart repair-were given no medication for relief of
their postoperative pain; the remainder received inadequate
doses. When 18 of the children were matched with adults who
underwent similar procedures, the children as a group were found
to have been given a total of 24 doses of analgesic drugs,
whereas the adults were given a total of 671 doses. </p>

<p>The elderly also pay the penalty of ignorance. In a study of
postsurgical pain my colleagues and I found that surgical wards
contain two basic populations: a young and middle-aged group that
recovers quickly and an older group whose pain remains severe and
lingers for many days beyond the normal three- to four-day
recovery period. Despite the persistent, high level of pain in
these older patients (presumably because of complications that
arise after surgery) and despite the longer recovery period, they
do not receive larger doses or a higher daily amount of
medication. About 30 Percent of the patients on a surgical ward
at any time fall into this older category; they thus represent a
substantial number of people who suffer needlessly high levels of
pain. </p>

<p>The pain suffered by bum victims is known to be agonizing, and
yet it too, tends to be poorly controlled. Manon Choiniare of the
Bum Center at the Hotel Dieu in Montreal and I found that even in
the best bum facilities-those with highly capable, compassionate
physicians, nurses, physiotherapists and others-pain levels are
high. Our study of 30 consecutive patients who underwent
debridement and physiotherapy (exercise to prevent loss of joint
flexibility) classified the severity of pain on the basis of the
Pain questionnaire I developed with Torgerson. We discovered that
during treatment in the first two weeks, 23 Percent had severe
(&quot;horrible&quot;) pain, and 30 percent had extremely severe
(&quot;excruciating&quot;) pain. Even when the Patients were at
rest, 13 percent of them reported having severe pain, and another
20 percent said they had extremely severe pain. These data, by
the way, were obtained from patients who were already medicated
according to standard textbook recommendations (that is, the drug
order said &quot;PRN&quot;). </p>

<p>For many patients who are hospitalized for surgery or bums or
who have terminal cancer, the prescription is clear: a preventive
approach to pain should be instituted to maximize the
effectiveness of narcotics therapy. What, though, should be done
for people who suffer from debilitating chronic pain but who do
not have a fatal illness? These people have traditionally been
excluded from longterm therapy with narcotics, again for fear
they would become addicts. </p>

<p>Consider the case of a 26-year-old athlete who sustained a
major spinal injury that caused him to suffer from excruciating
pain in the back and legs. The pain rendered him unable to work,
and he became a burden to himself, his family and society, which
pays his medical bills. His physician discovered that small doses
of morphine taken orally each day (the way cancer patients
receive them) obliterated the pain. With the help of the
medication, the young man resumed working and made plans to marry
his childhood sweetheart, who was accepting of his injury. </p>

<p>One day, however, the physician was accused by his regional
medical association of prescribing narcotics for a purpose
unapproved by the association and of turning the patient into an
addict. Fearful of losing his medical license, the physician
stopped prescribing the drug. (Where morphine administration is
allowed by law, physicians can technically prescribe it at will,
but they are in fact restricted by the regulations of medical
societies, which control licensing.) </p>

<p>Of course, the young man's pain returned. In desperation, he
turned to other physicians and was rebuffed. He then sank rapidly
into depression and again became mired in helplessness and
hopelessness. </p>

<p>It was once unthinkable to give narcotics indefinitely to
patients who were not terminally ill. Yet studies designed to
examine addiction specifically in such patients are beginning to
show that for them, as for the standard candidates for narcotics
therapy, these drugs can be helpful without producing addiction. </p>

<p>In one recent study Russell K. Portenoy and Kathleen M. Foley
of SloanKettering maintained 38 patients on narcotics for severe,
chronic noncancer pain; half of the patients received opioids for
four or more years, and six<b> </b>of these were treated for more
than seven years. About 60 percent of the 38 patients reported
that their pain was eliminated or at least reduced to a tolerable
level. The therapy became problematic in only two patients, both
of whom had a history of drug abuse. </p>

<p>With cautious optimism, Portenoy and Foley suggest that
morphine might be a reasonable treatment for chronic pain in many
patients who are not terminally ill. They point out the problems
that may accompany narcotics maintenance therapy, and they
provide careful guidelines for monitoring patients. Studies such
as theirs are doing something in medicine that is akin in
aeronautics to breaking the sound barrier. They represent a
breakthrough to a reasoned, unbiased examination of the
effectiveness of narcotics in patients who have rarely been
considered for such therapy. </p>

<p>Among the critics of long-term narcotics therapy for such
patients are physicians and others who fear that people will
simply be given a prescription for a drug and will never receive
the advantages of a multidisciplinary approach to the care of
pain. Yet both approaches are compatible; in fact, they
complement each other. </p>

<p>For the future, many more well-controlled studies are needed
to provide data on the long-term effects of narcotics on chronic
noncancer pain. At the same time, medical and government agencies
must provide the authorization and funds for such studies to take
place. The goal is nothing short of rescuing people whose lives
are now being ruined by pain. <br>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Skip Baker demonstrates the amount of
weight he lost because of severe, untreated chronic pain. He went
without eating for 14 months, while the State of Virginia was
deciding if he would be an &quot;authorized pain patient,&quot;
and get an increase in his pain medication. By not eating, the
lower dose of pain medication he was on at the time, was more
effective, and that saved his life as his pain was suicidal in
nature. He averaged a one inch loss around the middle per month,
for a total of 14 inches for the 14 months! This is like torture
for a State to do this to a Pain Patient, who they knew all
along, has Ankylosing Spondylitis,&quot; a VERY painful spinal
disease.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;The decision to make him an 'authorized'
pain patient could have been made in one hour by a good pain
specialist, if this system wasn't in place in Virginia. No doctor
in Virginia can treat a Pain Patient if this 'system' turns down
the patient. Baker finally got the help of President Clinton
after he e-mailed the story to the White House. The same day he
got the letter from the President, he was called to his doctor's
office and given the &quot;approval letter&quot; from the State
of Virginiia. It had been &quot;back dated&quot; to a time that
Virginia's Pain Clinic had claimed earlier, that he wasn't even
IN their &quot;system,&quot; showing how corrupt this Virginia
set up is.&quot; </font></p>

<h1>ASAP -American Society for Action on Pain</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2>Who are we? </h2>

<p>We are an organization of patients who suffer from chronic
pain, their families, the physicians who treat them, and other
interested citizens. </p>

<h2>Why is there a need for this organization? </h2>

<p>There is a crisis in pain treatment in the United States.
Many, if not most, patients who are in severe pain find it almost
impossible to get adequate pain medication. My own mother has
called me asking me if I would understand if she committed
suicide because of her pain. </p>

<h2>Why don't more people know about this problem? </h2>

<p><b>The first reason </b>is that pain patients report that
other people don't want to hear about it. The truth is that it is
very wearing and burdensome psychologically to listen to the
truth about another person's pain, especially when that pain is
severe enough that it has caused them to consider suicide. I have
heard from many of them, and I can confess honestly that it is
hard to listen to them sometimes, even when you want to help. If
it is that tiring for me - and I am not in pain - it must be far
worse for them. </p>

<p><b>The second reason</b> is that it is hard to be a force for
any kind of change in the world when you are in so much pain that
it is difficult to get out of bed, or even move. As bad as the
situation is, there is very little these people can do about it. </p>

<p><b>The third reason is that they die</b> - often because of
the pain directly when they commit suicide. No one is counting on
their votes in the next election. </p>

<h2>How did this happen? </h2>

<p>The primary reason is the War on Drugs. The drive to restrict
narcotics and other drugs went overboard on this issue from its
very inception. We have had such a &quot;moral&quot; and legal
drive against narcotics, that it has made it impossible for
patients to get them, even when there is a severe need, and they
are the cheapest, safest, and most effective medicines for pain. </p>

<p>The Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 contained a provision which
specifically allowed doctors to continue prescribing these
medicines, &quot;in the legitimate practice of medicine&quot;. At
the time the law was written, this clause was intended to allow
the use of narcotics for legitimate medical purposes, such as
pain control. However, the drug enforcement officials of the time
realized that, if doctors were allowed to prescribe drugs as they
saw fit for the best interests of their patients, this opened the
door to heroin maintenance programs, if the doctors thought
heroin maintenance was in the medical interests of the patient. </p>

<p>Therefore, the drug police obtained a court ruling that no
prescription of narcotics such as would fit within a
&quot;legitimate&quot; medical practice. This created a complete
prohibition of some drugs which are recognized safe and effective
medical pain relievers, such as heroin. </p>

<p>After the law was passed, there was considerable protest from
the medical community about the laws and the way they were being
enforced. To silence the opposition, the drug enforcement police
arrested about 3,000 doctors nationwide, focusing on those
doctors who were involved in drug addiction treatment and were
most vocal against the laws. That campaign against doctors
created a legacy that has lasted into modern times. </p>

<h2>Aren't these drugs addictive? </h2>

<p>Yes, these drugs are addictive for some people. See Basic
Facts About the War on Drugs for rankings of addictive qualities.
As with all drugs, the great majority of people who use them,
particularly for medical purposes, do not suffer from addiction.
Major studies of the medical use of drugs such as morphine has
shown that the addiction rate for the medical use of these drugs
is under one percent. In all cases, doctors report that they are
able to treat the addiction by gradually tapering off the
medicine. </p>

<h2>Where can I learn more about the problem? </h2>

<p>Read the references in other sections of this web page. You
can also get a copy of the report by the Department of Health and
Human Services at 1-800-4 CANCER. There are two reports, one for
doctors and medical professionals, and one for patients and
others. These reports will be coming to these pages in the near
future. </p>

<h2>What can you do to help? </h2>

<ol>
    <li>Join the Media Awareness Project. See the <a
        href="http://www.drcnet.org/map/">MAP Web Page</a>. Tell
        the media about this library. Get the truth out to
        everyone you can. Make sure your local media sources log
        in to this library and read the information before they
        do their next story on drugs. </li>
    <li>Write to your elected officials. Tell them that this drug
        policy is a sin. No matter what else we may do about
        drugs, there is no excusing for denying medicine to sick
        people. </li>
</ol>

<h1>PAIN MANAGEMENT POLICY</h1>

<p>The Nursing Practice Act, Section 2725, states that the
registered nurse provides &quot;direct and indirect patient care
services that insure the ... comfort ... of patients. 11 Proper
management of patient's pain is a nursing function incorporated
within the registered nurse's role as a patient advocate
(Standards of Competent Performance, Section 1443.5(6) of the
Nursing Practice Act). The Board of Registered Nursing endorses
pain management guidelines established by the World Health
organization, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, and the American Pain
Society. </p>

<p>The nursing function of appropriate pain management includes,
but is not limited to: </p>

<p>- ensuring informed consent for pain management. </p>

<p>- assessing pain and evaluating response to pain management
interventions using a standard pain management scale based on
patient self-report. </p>

<p>- educating staff, patients and families regarding the
difference between tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction
in relation to pain relieving medications, and the low risk of
addiction from long-term use and/or high doses of opiates for
pain relief. </p>

<p>- educating patients and families in a culturally competent
manner regarding appropriate expectations for pain management. </p>

<p>- recognizing that prn medications may be given around-the
clock. </p>

<p>- intervening to treat pain before the pain becomes severe. </p>

<p>- using non-drug interventions to assist in pain alleviation. </p>

<p>- using knowledge of equianalgesic dosages to maintain both
patient safety and pain relief as routes and types of ordered
drugs change. </p>

<p>- documenting pain assessment, intervention, and evaluation
activities in a clear and concise manner. </p>

<p>- intervening to minimize drug side effects. </p>

<p>- implementing quality assurance/improvement standards to
monitor the pain management program.<br>

<h2>A STATEMENT BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA: </h2>

<h2>PRESCRIBING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES FOR PAIN </h2>

<p>On May 6 the Medical Board formally adopted the following
statement on &quot;Prescribing For Pain Management.&quot; </p>

<p>It is the first formal statement of its kind in the nation
made by a licensing board. </p>

<p>This statement was adopted after a year of testimony at
hearings held by the Board's Task Force on Appropriate
Prescribing and a day-long &quot;Summit,&quot; sponsored by
Governor Wilson, involving scores of experts from around the
country. </p>

<p>At the Board's July 28-29 meeting the members will consider
formal adoption of a set of guidelines based on this policy
statement. The guidelines. once adopted, will be published in the
October Action Report and other publications read by physicians. </p>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>The 1993 report of the Medical Board to the Governor signalled
a new beginning in the history of medical regulation in
California. An important part of this initiative is
implementation of the recommendations made by the Board's Task
Force on Appropriate Prescribing, chaired by Jacquelin Trestrail,
M.D. </p>

<p>The Task Force was established to look into
&quot;malprescribing,&quot; one of the fastest growing categories
of physician discipline. The Board continues to be concerned that
controlled substances are subject to abuse by individuals who
seek them for their mood altering and other psychological
effects, rather than for legitimate medical purposes. </p>

<p>The Board is also concerned about effective pain management
and the appropriate medical use of controlled substances. During
the Task Force's public meetings, the members heard testimony
that some physicians avoid prescribing controlled substances,
including the &quot;triplicate&quot; drugs, for patients with
intractable pain for fear of discipline by the Board. The Task
Force recommended that the Board take a pro-active approach to
emphasize to all California physicians that it supports
prescribing of opioid analgesics (narcotics) and other controlled
substances when medically indicated for the treatment of pain,
including intractable pain. After careful review of this matter,
the Board concurs with the following statement. </p>

<p>This statement is consistent with good medical practice,
protection of public health and consumer interests, with
international treaties, federal and California law, including the
California Intractable Pain Treatment Act. </p>

<p>THE PAIN PROBLEM </p>

<p>The Board recognizes that pain, whether due to trauma,
surgery, cancer and other diseases, is often undertreated.
Minorities, women, children, the elderly and people with HIV/AIDS
are at particular risk for under treatment of their pain.
Unrelieved pain has a harsh and sometimes disastrous impact on
the quality of life of people and their families. </p>

<p>While some progress is being made to improve pain and symptom
management, the Board is concerned that a number of factors
continue to interfere with effective pain management These
include the low priority of pain management in our health care
system, incomplete integration of current knowledge into medical
education and clinical practice, lack of knowledge among
consumers about pain management, exaggerated fears of opioid side
effects and addiction, and fear of legal consequences when
controlled substances are used. </p>

<p>PAIN MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY IN CALIFORNIA </p>

<p>Principles of quality medical practice dictate that citizens
of California who suffer from pain should be able to obtain the
relief that is currently available. The Board believes that the
appropriate application of current knowledge and treatments would
greatly improve the quality of life for many California citizens,
and could also reduce the morbidity and the costs that are
associated with uncontrolled pain. </p>

<p>In addition to making this statement, the Board will take a
number of steps to help make effective pain management a reality
in California. The Board has provided information to all state
physicians about new clinical practice guidelines for pain
management that have been prepared by a panel of experts
supported by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. The
Board also co-sponsored and participated in the March 18, 1994
Pain Management and Appropriate Prescribing Summit in conjunction
with the Department of Consumer Affairs on removing impediments
to appropriate prescribing of controlled substances for effective
pain management. Further, the Board will develop guidelines to
help physicians avoid investigation if they appropriately
prescribe controlled substances for pain management. </p>

<p>THE APPROPRIATE ROLE OF OPIOID ANALGESICS </p>

<p>There are numerous drug and non-drug treatments that are used
for the management of pain and other symptoms. The proper
treatment of any patient's pain depends upon a careful diagnosis
of the etiology of the pain, selection of appropriate and cost
effective treatments, and ongoing evaluation of the results of
treatment. Opioid analgesics and other controlled substances arc
useful for the treatment of pain, and are considered the
cornerstone of treatment of acute pain due to trauma, surgery and
chronic pain due to progressive diseases such as cancer. Large
doses may be necessary to control pain if it is severe. Extended
therapy may be necessary if the pain is chronic. </p>

<p>The Board recognizes that opioid analgesics can also be useful
in the treatment of patients with intractable non-malignant pain
especially where efforts to remove the cause of pain or to treat
it with other modalities have failed. The pain of such patients
may have a number of different etiologies and may require several
treatment modalities. In addition, the extent to which pain is
associated with physical and psychosocial impairment varies
greatly. Therefore, the selection of a patient for a trial of
opioid therapy should be based upon a careful assessment of the
pain as well as the disability experienced by the patient
Continuation of opioid therapy should be based on the physician's
evaluation of the results of treatment, including the degree of
pain relief, changes in physical and psychological functioning,
and appropriate utilization of health care resources. Physicians
should not hesitate to obtain consultation from legitimate
practitioners who specialize in pain management. </p>

<p>The Board recommends that physicians pay particular attention
to those patients who misuse their prescriptions, particularly
when the patient or family have a history of substance abuse that
could complicate pain management The management of pain in such
patients requires extra care and monitoring, as well as
consultation with medical specialists whose area of expertise is
substance abuse or pain management </p>

<p>The Board believes that addiction should be placed into proper
perspective. Physical dependence and tolerance are normal
physiologic consequences of extended opioid therapy and are not
the same as addiction. Addiction is a behavioral syndrome
characterized by psychological dependence and aberrant drug
related behaviors. Addicts compulsively use drugs for nonmedical
purposes despite harmful effects-, a person who is addicted may
also be physically dependent or tolerant. Patients with chronic
pain should not be considered addicts or habitues merely because
they are being treated with opioids. </p>

<p>PAIN MANAGEMENT, CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND THE LAW </p>

<p>The laws and regulations of the federal government and the
State of California impose special requirements for the
prescribing of controlled substances, including requirements as
to the form of the prescription document, so as to prevent harm
to the public health that is caused when prescription drugs are
diverted to non-medical uses. For example, it is illegal to
prescribe controlled substances solely to maintain narcotic
addiction. However, federal and California law clearly recognize
that it is a legitimate medical practice for physicians to
prescribe controlled substances for the treatment of pain,
including intractable pain. </p>

<p>The Medical Board will work with the Drug Enforcement
Administration, the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement, the Office of
the Attorney General, the Board of Pharmacy and its own
investigators in an attempt to develop policy and guidelines
based on the physician's diagnosis and treatment program rather
than amounts of drugs prescribed. </p>

<p>Concerns about regulatory scrutiny should not make physicians
who follow appropriate guidelines reluctant to prescribe or
administer controlled substances, including Schedule 11 drugs,
for patients with a legitimate medical need for them. A physician
is not subject to Board action when prescribing in the regular
course of his or her profession to one under the physician's
treatment for a pathology or condition and where the prescription
is issued after a good faith examination and where there is
medical indication for the drug. Good faith prescribing requires
an equally good faith history, physical examination and
documentation. </p>

<p>The Medical Board may identify a pattern of controlled
substance use that merits further examination. A private,
courteous and professional inquiry can usually determine whether
the physician is in good faith appropriately prescribing for
patients, or whether an investigation is necessary. The Board
will judge the validity of prescribing based on the physician's
diagnosis and treatment of the patient and whether the drugs
prescribed by the physician are appropriate for that condition,
and will not act on the basis of predetermined numerical limits
on dosages or length of drug therapy. </p>

<p>The Board hopes to replace practitioners' perception of
inappropriate regulatory scrutiny with recognition of the Board's
commitment to enhance the quality of life of patients by
improving pain management while, at the same time, preventing the
diversion and abuse of controlled substances. </p>

<p>To: All Participants of the Summit on Effective Pain
Management </p>

<p>Re: Summit Report from the Summit on Effective Pain
Management: Removing Impediments to Appropriate Prescribing </p>

<p>We are pleased to share with you the final Summit Report from
the Summit on Effective Pain Management. This report was produced
through the joint efforts of many summit participants, sponsors,
and the summit planning committee. Although the report process
took longer than we anticipated, we felt it was necessary and
important to include input from all participants who provided
excellent, thoughtful and feasible recommendations to address the
issues and concerns brought to the table at the Summit. </p>

<p>Two important outcomes resulted from the Summit: </p>

<p>1) A productive, positive coalition has been created to focus
attention and to direct actions to pain management problems and
issues. This coalition of health care practitioners, professional
and public educators, academicians, professional association
representatives, pharmaceutical manufacturer representatives,
health care consumers, pain patients, regulators and legislators
is unique and unprecedented. The group now has an open
communication channel with each other and critical sectors such
as regulators, which can make the necessary changes to improve
pain management. </p>

<p>2) Due tlo the Summit, many pain management activities have
been undertaken and that is a major achievement. The Medical
Board of California and the Board of Registered Nursing have
adopted policies on pain management. The Board of Pharmacy is in
the process of establishing a similar policy and has agreed to
underwrite a feasibility study to implement an electronic
monitoring system of controlled substances prescriptions by
December 1, 1994. </p>

<p>The Summit has been an effective forum to exchange ideas and
information, share solutions and take action. We thank all of you
who took the time to give us your comments and input for the
draft report. This Summit Report reflects the energy, interest
and dedication that the participants demonstrated throughout the
entire summit process. </p>

<p>Please feel free to contact Lowayne Shieh at 91 6-324-0794 or
other members of the Summit Planning Committee (roster included
in report) if you have questions or comments. For additional
copies of the Summit Report, please call 916-445-7450 or fax your
request to 916-322-2951. </p>

<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>

<p>Many Californians suffer from acute pain associated with
injury, illness, and surgery, as well as from chronic pain due to
cancer, degenerative diseases and other conditions.. Unrelieved
pain impedes recovery from surgery, injury, or illness;
interferes with physical functioning and productivity; destroys
the quality of life; and increases the use and cost of health
care services. </p>

<p>However, the reality is that many effective treatments are
available. Drug treatments include the opioid analgesics and
other controlled substances that are the cornerstone of acute and
cancer pain management and are also useful for carefully selected
patients with chronic, noncancer pain. There are also nondrug
treatments, including physical and psychological approaches, that
are effective in pain management. </p>

<p>Many patients do not receive effective treatment. Pain is
undertreated in our society for many reasons: the low priority
given to pain management by our health care system; failure to
diagnose pain properly; lack of awareness that much pain can be
relieved; incomplete application of existing knowledge;
exaggerated fears of addiction; and problems with government and
private sector attitudes toward controlled substances, health
care, and reimbursement. Pain is also more likely to be
undertreated if the patient is minority, female, elderly, or a
child. </p>

<p>Significant and widespread concern about the undertreatment of
pain in California has united many diverse groups in the last
several years. The Legislature, state agencies, associations of
professionals, and concerned health care professionals have taken
major steps toward effective pain management. The Governor,
through the State and Consumer Services Agency, convened this
Summit to examine why pain is undertreated in California and to
initiate collaborative efforts to remove the impediments to
appropriate pain management. </p>

<p>On March 18, 1994, more than 120 representatives from the
health, education, legislative, regulatory, and public sectors
examined the barriers to effective pain management. Participants
made a number of recommendations that are detailed later in this
report, including: </p>

<p>Inform patients that they are entitled to quality pain
management and should have informed consent on the choice of
treatment plans for their pain. </p>

<p>Establish accountability in the health care system for the
assessment and management of pain. Examine the extent to which
inadequately or improperly managed pain leads to additional
health care costs, including lack of recovery, slower recovery,
and unnecessary and extended hospitalization. </p>

<p>Have regulatory boards adopt policies that foster appropriate
use of controlled substances in pain management. Include
questions about pain on licensing examinations for health care
professionals. </p>

<p>Revise laws and regulations that: impede timely access to pain
medications by patients; contain confusing standards such as
&quot;excessive prescribing;' and appear to ban prescribing
controlled substances to patients in pain with a history of drug
abuse. </p>

<p>Replace the triplicate prescription system with an electronic
prescription monitoring system as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Develop clear standards for evaluating and investigating
inappropriate prescribing methods. </p>

<p>Promote ongoing communication among regulators, health care
practitioners, and law enforcement agencies involved in
monitoring or investigating prescription medication. </p>

<p>Improve peer review of pain management and general prescribing
practices. </p>

<p>Ensure that all patients-receive adequate pain treatment
regardless of age, race, gender, ethnicity, or medical condition.
</p>

<p>Assure that health care coverage includes pain 'management
services and medications. Work with California's Insurance
Commissioner and others, including third party payors, Medi-Cal,
and MediCare, to examine and remove impediments to: reimbursement
for pain medications; pain assessment; and appropriate
consultation and treatment, including exclusion or limitation on
conditions covered or amount of medication covered. </p>

<p>Develop a more active role for pain medication manufacturers,
including better, more readable drug information, consumer
bulletins, and telephone services. </p>

<p>Accelerate the education of the public, patients, regulators,
and health care professionals about pain management. </p>

<hr>

<h2>OVERVIEW OF PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES</h2>

<p>The Summit helped to identify public policy issues relating to
the management and treatment of chronic pain within California's
health care, regulatory, and law enforcement environment: </p>

<p>1. California citizens experience significant undertreatment
of acute,cancer-related pain, postoperative pain or other pain,
including chronic, nonmalignant pain. </p>

<p>2. There are many important nonpharmacologic methods for
treating pain, but controlled substances, including opioids, play
a critical role in pain management. Regulatory mechanisms must
strike a balance between providing timely access to morphine and
other Schedule 11 controlled medications that relieve chronic
intractable pain, while preventing diversion of those medications
for nontherapeutic uses. </p>

<p>Currently, there are both government and private sector
impediments to patients receiving sufficient, timely, and
appropriate treatment. There is also a persistent problem with
diversion of some controlled substances from legitimate channels.
And at least some current regulatory practices are not achieving
their purposes. </p>

<p>3. A coalition has emerged that believes that all patients
have a right to adequate pain management and should participate
in decisions regarding the treatment and management of their
pain. However, it is not yet current practice for all health care
providers, in all health care settings within the State, to
actively involve patients and their caregivers in deciding the
course of pain management treatment, whether by medication or
nonmedication techniques. </p>

<p>4. Patients and their caregivers, health care professionals,
and government agencies lack up-to-date knowledge regarding pain
management and appropriate use of controlled.substances. </p>

<hr>

<h2>IMPEDIMENTS To APPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING</h2>

<p>Pain Assessment </p>

<p>Lack of recognition of patient rights and professional
responsibilities. </p>

<p>Lack of interdisciplinary assessment. </p>

<p>Failure to use simple, standard assessment techniques already
available. </p>

<p>Development of Treatment Plans </p>

<p>Low priority of pain management in the health care system. </p>

<p>Financial disincentives by payors. </p>

<p>Fear of regulatory intrusion. </p>

<p>Prescribing Pain Medication </p>

<p>Outdated triplicate prescription system. </p>

<p>Unwarranted fears of addiction and side effects. </p>

<p>Inadequate use of allied health professionals in long-term
care and hospice settings. </p>

<p>Failure to serve the underserved population adequately, such
as rural or inner city patients. </p>

<p>Administration of Pain Treatment to the Patient </p>

<p>· Regulatory delays in the delivery of medication to
patients. </p>

<p>· Payor restrictions on payment for pain-related services. </p>

<p>· Limited patient and professional knowledge about pain
management techniques. </p>

<p>· Incomplete planning for discharging patients. </p>

<p>Ongoing Evaluation </p>

<p>Infrequent dialogue between patients and their health care
providers. </p>

<p>Diversion of Pain Medication to Nontherapeutic Uses </p>

<p>Inability to analyze and use information captured by
regulatory and investigative agencies. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>IMPEDIMENTS To APPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING</b> </p>

<p>Summit participants addressed the significant undertreatment
of acute, cancer related and other pain, including chronic,
nonmalignant pain. Participants recognized that every person or
entity that is involved in providing care or that regulates
health care practitioners must acknowledge that patients have the
right to receive and participate in appropriate pain management. </p>

<p>A variety of regulatory and nonregulatory factors may impede
effective pain management. These factors are arranged in sections
that roughly parallel the delivery of pain care to patients. </p>

<p><b>Impediments to Pain Assessment</b> </p>

<p>Patients, their family members, and allied health care
professionals assess and report pain. However, patients are often
unaware of their rights and responsibilities regarding pain
management, including that pain can usually be treated and
doesn't have to be the &quot;price&quot; of illness or disease. </p>

<p>Many chronic-pain patients believe that health care providers
often presume to know how much pain their patients experience,
don't really believe what their patients say, or are not as
interested in treating the pain as they are in treating the
disease. Patients report pain but often are not provided with
universal tools such as pain assessment questionnaires or
methodologies that provide physicians with feedback to
appropriately manage treatment. </p>

<p>Nurses, pharmacists, and others in the patient-care chain are
critical to the management of pain, including proper
administration of pain medication, reporting changes in the
tolerance to medication, and triggering timely followup
assessment. This interdisciplinary, ongoing pain assessment is
critical but is often weakened by caregivers, professionals, and
nonprofessionals alike, who are not familiar with their role in
pain management. </p>

<p><b>Impediments to Development of Treatment Plans</b> </p>

<p>Pain management is a low priority in the health care system.
Medication and nonmedication approaches to managing pain and its
side effects are often afterthoughts in developing a patient's
treatment plan because of outdated knowledge of and attitudes
toward pain management, as well as an antiquated approach to
prescribing controlled substances. </p>

<p>Financial disincentives by payors can needlessly limit and
bias pain treatment. Insurance company managers and other
personnel lack an understanding and acceptance of pain management
which can result in: denial of coverage; lack of access to
certain pain management procedures and medication; or use of more
expensive and often less effective treatments. </p>

<p>Additionally, as long as physicians are fearful of regulatory
intrusion, they will continue to undertreat pain. Fear of
reprisal often overrides appropriate, aggressive use of drugs. </p>

<p><b>Impediments to Prescribing Pain Medication</b> </p>

<p>The triplicate prescription system-which must be used when
Schedule 11 controlled substances are prescribed-is outdated,
impractical for many modern health care settings (especially
long-term care), and generally ineffective for monitoring and
controlling diversion of medications for nontherapeutic purposes.
Because of the administrative complexities of and implied
intimidation by the triplicate system, almost half of
California's physicians have chosen not to seek prescribing
privileges for Schedule 11 medications. This system of oversight
is often viewed as persecution by physicians and pharmacists, and
the result is that patients in pain suffer. </p>

<p>Unwarranted fears of opioid addiction and side effects still
exist among practitioners, and especially among the public,
patients, and their caregivers. As the Medical Board of
California, in its statement 'Prescribing Controlled Substances
for Pain,' concluded, minorities, women, children, the elderly,
and people with HIV/AIDS are at particular risk for
undertreatment of their pain. </p>

<p>State law implies that drug addicts should be treated
differently for pain or not treated for pain at all. Laws and
regulations are inflexible in addressing this population of
patients. </p>

<p><b>Impediments to Administration of Pain Treatment</b> </p>

<p>Summit participants gave many examples of how the triplicate
prescription system also delays the delivery of medication to
patients. First, over half of California physicians do not write
triplicate prescriptions. Both prescribers and pharmacists find
the triplicate form cumbersome and time-consuming to use and
process. Even minor errors can invalidate the triplicate,
requiring that the entire process be repeated. </p>

<p>Pharmacies experience a delay in the receipt of Schedule 11
opioids due to minor, inadvertent discrepancies on DEA form 222
that can compromise patient care. In emergency circumstances, the
requirement that the distributors and manufacturers receive DEA
Form 222 prior to the shipment of Schedule 11 drugs can result in
patient hardship. </p>

<p>Third-party payors often restrict payment for pain-related
services, especially for Medicare and Medi-Cal patients. </p>

<p>Patients' and caregivers' knowledge of pain management and the
appropriate use of controlled substances and other pain
management techniques is limited. Educational materials available
to prescribing physicians for distribution to their patients are
equally limited. This intensifies patient and caregiver
misgivings and misunderstandings and complicates compliance and
education issues. </p>

<p>When patients leave hospitals and are transported to other
facilities, continuity of pain treatment is frequently ignored.
Patients frequently do not receive an adequate supply of
medication for effective pain management. </p>

<p><b>Impediments to Ongoing Evaluation</b> </p>

<p>Pain management, whether drug or nondrug-based treatment,
requires that patients and their health care providers discuss
with each other the effectiveness of various treatment methods
and dosage levels. Payors are often unwilling to reimburse health
professionals for sufficient ongoing pain evaluation, and in some
instances set artificial limits on the amount of drug and nondrug
treatments, services, or both. </p>

<p><b>Diversion of Pain Medication to Nontherapeutic Uses</b> </p>

<p>Participants recognized that drug diversion is a problem in
California that must be controlled. Participants. validated the
need for vigilance and oversight but stressed the importance of
balancing that need with relieving the suffering of people in
pain. </p>

<p>Regulators, health care professionals, and patients agree that
the current regulatory structure fails to provide good data that
can identify and reduce diversion. </p>

<p>There is limited ability to analyze information captured by
the regulatory system in a timely manner and use it to control
diversion. </p>

<hr>

<h2>SUMMIT RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>

<p>Participants recognized that any solution to the problem of
inadequate pain management requires the cooperative efforts of
regulators, practitioners, patients, payors, and the public to
educate themselves regarding the nature of pain, the extent of
pain, and pain management itself. </p>

<p>Participants acknowledged that drug diversion is a problem in
California which must be controlled. Participants discussed the
nature and extent of statutes and regulation, and the regulatory
and law enforcement activity that is necessary to control the
problem without hampering medical care. </p>

<p>The following sections categorize the recommendations
according to the groups that the summit participants believe are
the best, most effective agents for change. Each section includes
consensus recommendations, as well as other input that was
received but to which not everyone agreed. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Legislators to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Our legislators should provide continuing leadership for pain
management by assessing the value of laws, regulations, and
policies concerning the prescribing, dispensing, or administering
of controlled substances. Legislators should strike a balance
between the efficacy of identifying and controlling abuses, the
scope of the problem, and interfering with legitimate medical
care. The following legislative changes were recommended: </p>

<p>Replace the requirement for a special, state-issued
prescription form (triplicate system) with electronic monitoring
of controlled substances prescriptions that can foster better,
more effective pain management and better diversion detection.
Ensure that any such system is based on sound principles, such as
those set out in the model Uniform Controlled Substances Act and
in the report of the Controlled Substances Prescription Advisory
Council. The Board of Pharmacy has agreed to underwrite the
feasibility study to implement this recommendation, and the
report will be due December 1, 1994. </p>

<p>Electronic monitoring must be able to track diversion of
controlled substances by prescribers, pharmacists, and patients. </p>

<p>Until the triplicate system is replaced, reduce the burden on
physicians, pharmacists and patients to avoid disrupting good
pain control. For example, no triplicate should be needed if
there is a written order in medical records of a licensed health
care agency. Similarly telephone or faxed prescriptions should be
accepted under certain circumstances. </p>

<p>Revise laws and regulations to reflect the current practices
of those involved in pain management, especially in emerging
health care settings. (increased costs of hospitalization have
encouraged the use of nonhospital settings. Today we see greater
reliance on skilled nursing facilities, long-term care
facilities, and earlier release to home settings.) </p>

<p>Eliminate the apparent prohibition on prescribing controlled
substances to those with a history of drug abuse. People in pain
should receive effective treatment regardless of whether they
have a dependency problem. </p>

<p>Clarify or eliminate confusing or outdated statutory
provisions, including &quot;clearly excessive prescribing or
dispensing&quot; of controlled substances and the use of the
terms &quot;addict&quot; and &quot;habitual user.&quot; </p>

<p>Evaluate mail-order restrictions on drugs, including
limitations on the number of doses, and the impact of such
restrictions on patient well-being. </p>

<p>Identify funding sources for the Food and Drug Section of the
California Department of Health Services to eliminate delays in
the evaluation of new drugs and devices. </p>

<p><b>Other Input for Legislators to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Oklahoma and several other states have approved coordinated
legislation and regulations that streamline the regulatory
mechanism, yet provide good data with which to control possible
diversion of medications. California can and should use these
models as a starting point for improving the effectiveness of its
regulatory mechanisms. </p>

<p>In long-term care, hospice care, and certain other health care
settings, other health professionals are closer to patients than
physicians. These health professionals should be considered for
privileges to legally prescribe or regulate the dosage of
controlled substances in response to a patient's daily medical
condition. </p>

<p>Address issues of personal liability and prosecution for
prescribing a Schedule II opioid for treatment of acute pain
(i.e., postoperative), chronic intractable pain, or cancer pain
to a patient with a known substance abuse history. </p>

<p>Ensure that individuals who are prescribed opioids for chronic
pain are not denied employment or discharged solely based on drug
screening that is used increasingly. as an employment screening
tool. </p>

<p>Create, by statute, a positive legal duty to effectively treat
pain and suffering, such as: Doctors (e.g., MD, DO, DIVID, DPM)
have a duty to effectively treat the pain and suffering of a
patient. Effective pain and suffering treatment is that provided
by current clinical practice guidelines on pain management issued
by the US Department of Health and Human Services, or that
followed by clinicians who specialize in pain management. Doctors
have a duty to effectively treat pain, including appropriate
referral to and periodic review by clinicians who specialize in
pain management. </p>

<p>Create a controlled substances credential for physicians that
requires ongoing education in pain management and appropriate
prescribing. </p>

<p>Legislate pain management education as a requirement for
licensure. </p>

<p>Be careful what we legislate. Develop a standard that is
issued and administered by boards, but one that is not too
legislatively detailed that we might regret it later. </p>

<p>Incorporate the White House model on Electronic Data Transfer
(EDT) programs. </p>

<p>Health care facilities should demonstrate a minimum standard
of pain management by the end of 1996, using federal guidelines
as reference standards. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Regulators to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Develop and promote positive statements on pain management and
the appropriate use of controlled substances by the medical,
nursing, pharmacy, dental, podiatry, physician assistant and
osteopathic boards, and the Department of Consumer Affairs. An
example of such a statement is the draft policy statement
circulated to Summit participants by the Medical Board of
California on May 6, 1994 (see attachment). The Board of
Registered Nursing has also adopted a pain management policy (see
attachment). </p>

<p>When electronic monitoring is implemented, take into
consideration the unique needs of specialty practices and pain
patients. Some patients need high doses of opioids for extended
periods. </p>

<p>Take into consideration that unusual prescribing practices are
sometimes necessary to take care of patients in pain. </p>

<p>Develop and communicate to licensees clear standards for
evaluation and investigation of inappropriate prescribing and
dispensing. Avoid standards that rely on volume or duration of
prescribing without taking into account the nature of the
prescriber's practice and the condition for which a particular
controlled substance is prescribed. </p>

<p>Ensure that government uses consultants and experts who are
currently involved in either pain management or the licensee's
field of practice. </p>

<p>Promote ongoing communication among regulators, practitioners,
and legislators, so that all are sensitized to the impact of pain
management laws and regulations. Likewise, maintain communication
and cooperation among the various regulatory and law enforcement
agencies involved in monitoring or investigating prescription
controlled substances practices. </p>

<p>Ensure that neither laws and regulations nor health care
facility policies interfere with the ability of patients,
especially cancer patients who are discharged from one facility
to another or from a facility to home care, to have an
uninterrupted supply of adequate analgesics. </p>

<p>Include questions on pain management in health care
professional licensure examinations and encourage revision of
professional school curricula to include adequate coverage of
pain management in Undergraduate and postgraduate training. </p>

<p>Simplify and clarify federal policy regarding the use of
federal controlled substance order forms, including emergency
transfer of controlled substances from a manufacturer or
distributor to pharmacies which have run out of a controlled
substance. Examine other federal provisions which govern
emergency supplies of controlled substances. Clarify federal
enforcement policy governing minor, inadvertent errors on
controlled substance order forms. </p>

<p>There was a clear consensus at the Summit that professional
education in pain management techniques and appropriate
prescribing is a critical component of addressing these issues.
There was not, however, consensus on whether this continuing
education should be mandated by regulation or legislation. Other
input on this topic included: </p>

<p>Legislation requiring physician education or competence in
pain management will likely breed resentment and reduced
effectiveness. A better strategy would be to encourage
educational attempts to improve the skills of training and
practicing physicians by engaging the profession in a positive
program to find a solution that will improve the care of their
patients. </p>

<p>This summit is a landmark for pain education and treatment.
However, until state boards put their licensed members on notice
that a lack of basic knowledge about pain, pain assessment,
drugs, and treatment is not the standard of practice for patient
care, little will change. Even federal guidelines have not had an
impact. The state should mandate that all licensed members must
demonstrate updated basic pain management skills by a set date -
say 1996. There would be a vertical learning curve - which would
result in less patient suffering, less pain related medical
costs, less time spent time away from work, and savings for
private and government payors. </p>

<p>Currently, medical professionals must acquire extensive,
additional education to learn the multitude of regulatory
statutes. This is a real disincentive to learn or change practice
if that change increases liability. A teacher at an academic
medical center can teach the clinical issues to students and
practitioners, but they are 're-educated' by regulatory issues
and concerns shared by practicing colleagues. </p>

<p>Just as real estate brokers and lawyers are required to have a
course in ethics as part of their mandatory continuing education
requirements, licensed health care professionals should have a
mandatory course in effective pain management or a
self-assessment test on pain management as part of their
licensing requirements. </p>

<p>Other input on the triplicate system included: </p>

<p>Until the triplicate program is replaced, could the Bureau of
Narcotic Enforcement send the triplicates preseparated and in
larger quantities to prevent the need for monthly, half-yearly,
or yearly prescriptions orders, which are not in a patient's best
interest? </p>

<p>It is interesting that the only members of the participating
panel who are in favor of triplicates are the lay members. It is
difficult enough to obtain a sufficient supply of triplicates
that are received in a timely manner and are reliable and
reproducible. It takes more than four minutes to properly fill
out a triplicate and most MDs cannot allow a patient to talk
while the triplicate is being written for tear of making an
error. </p>

<p><b>Other Input for Regulators to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Phone authorization is not a solution in many cases. As a
pharmacist who has worked in a community pharmacy, you do not
know all the MDs who may call your pharmacy. As a pharmacist, you
and your staff's safety is always in the back of your mind. If
someone you do not know calls asking it you carry triplicate
drugs, you say 'no.' It only takes looking down one shotgun
barrel for you to tell a white lie. For phone authorization to
work, it is imperative to educate MDs to talk with pharmacists in
their area and let them know their prescribing patterns. If
communication between MDs and pharmacists occurs, obtaining these
medications in California will be much easier. </p>

<p>Long-term care, home health and hospice practitioners need
authorization for an emergency controlled substances kit. A
72-hour supply of Schedule 11 drugs should be available for
hospice, long-term care, and home health settings. </p>

<p>Nurse practitioners often serve as the most accessible primary
care providers for people in California's rural communities.
Eight states currently allow prescribing of controlled substances
by nurse practitioners. Can California follow their lead? </p>

<p>I practice medicine in a large group, and my patients' records
are typed and quite complete. When I am away, some of the
patients for whom I care run out of medication and call one of my
partners for a refill. The rule that there must be a &quot;good
faith' exam if more than 72 hours of pain medication are to be
prescribed is a great imposition on my patients, who, by law
must: 1) make an unnecessary and expensive trip to the physician;
or 2) try to get by for however long it is until I return. This
rule should be revised to at least encompass situations in which
adequate records are available. </p>

<p>Reviews should be performed by those who have knowledge of and
are sensitive to the practice setting being investigated.
Reviewers should be practicing in the same medical area. </p>

<p>Require health care facilities to demonstrate minimum
standards of pain management for licensure after 1996. U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for Acute and
Cancer Pain Management can be used as reference standards. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Consumers and Their Caregivers to
Consider</b> </p>

<p>Summit participants agreed that consumers will get changes in
pain management when they demand them. They can't wait for
physicians to provide those changes. For example, detection of
breast and prostate cancer are areas where consumers have
demanded and received changes in standard practice from their
physicians. </p>

<p>Ensure that patients are informed of their rights, including
the alternatives for pain management and treatment, and that they
exercise informed consent. Ensure that every patient knows he or
she is entitled to receive adequate treatment for pain and to
have his or her reports of pain believed. Ensure that patients or
their caregivers receive adequate consultation about drug therapy
from the prescriber, dispenser, or other qualified health care
professional. </p>

<p>Make use of the many consumer publications and groups,
including those which target special groups such as minorities,
women, children, and the elderly, to communicate rights to
patients, their caregivers and the public. Distribute the Agency
for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) patient guidelines to
pharmacies and to other appropriate health care settings,
including all cancer care facilities. </p>

<p>Ensure that misinformation based on race, ethnicity, gender,
and age factors does not affect the treatment of pain. </p>

<p>Educate members of the media, including television, print, and
radio about the importance of pain management as a part of the
health care reform agenda. </p>

<p>The public and private sectors must work together to use
consumer research to develop a campaign the public will accept. </p>

<p><b>Other Input for Consumers and Their Caregivers to Consider</b>
</p>

<p>The message of the war on drugs is adversely affecting public
attitudes toward medical use of controlled substances. We need to
recognize that substance abuse is primarily a medical, not a
criminal, problem. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Health Care Professionals to Consider</b>
</p>

<p>Increase and improve the education of health care
professionals, including: current standards of pain management,
available tools to assess the nature and severity of pain, and
patients as the best source of information about their pain. </p>

<p>Recognize that proper management of pain often includes both
drug and nondrug therapy, and proper initial and ongoing
assessments, including: (1) more individualized pain treatment
that is based on a patient's report, presenting condition, and
current and past physical, social, and psychological condition
and treatment; (2) standardized questionnaires assessing the
physical, psychological, social, and cultural factors affecting
pain, administered by appropriately trained health care
personnel; and (3) interdisciplinary involvement by doctors,
nurses, pharmacists, psychotherapists, and others. </p>

<p>Better professional and ongoing education on adequate pain
management is critical and must include: </p>

<p>· Education on patient rights to pain management and
medication; </p>

<p>· Revision of professional school curricula to include
adequate coverage of pain management issues in undergraduate and
postgraduate training; </p>

<p>· Offering enough continuing education programs that address
the issues of physicians whose knowledge is dated; and </p>

<p>· Education on nondrug pain management techniques beyond
medication. </p>

<p>A number of comments argued for mandating pain management
education, but Summit participants did not come to a consensus on
whether mandates were the most appropriate way to motivate
physicians and other health care professionals. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Payors to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Summit participants generally agreed that pain management is
given a very low priority by payors. The comment that best
reflects the discussion is &quot;they think they [payors] are
saving money, but they're not.&quot; </p>

<p>Payors should assess the total cost of leaving their patients
in pain. They should update their policies, standards, and
guidelines for reimbursement to reflect that effectively managed
pain can return patients to active, productive lives. Such
assessment and change can result in lower total health care
costs. </p>

<p>Work with California's Insurance Commissioner and others,
including both public and private third party payors, to examine
ways to remove impediments to reimbursement for pain medications,
pain assessment, appropriate consultation, and treatment,
including exclusions of or limitations on conditions covered or
amounts of drugs covered. </p>

<p>Examine the extent to which inadequately or improperly managed
pain leads to additional health care costs, including lack of
recovery, slower recovery, unnecessary hospitalization and
extended hospitalization. </p>

<p>The State Insurance Commissioner should begin a dialogue with
payors who do business in California to initiate the studies
recommended above to assess whether payors' pain management
practices require regulation. </p>

<p><b>Other Input for Payors to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Payors impose more prior approval requirements for pain
management than for other procedures. </p>

<p>Measure the outcome of patients treated for intractable pain
through the increased use of Health Assessment Questionnaires
(HAOs). Many authorities (e.g., J.F. Fries, T. Pincus, etc.) have
shown that these instruments are accurate, reproducible and
statistically superior to many more commonly used medical tests.
Unfortunately the insurance industry, which will pay for Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI), will not pay for the administering and
grading HAQs. </p>

<p>Many comments mentioned unreasonable and clinically
counterproductive Medicare guidelines for reimbursement of pain
management visits and medications. One example is: </p>

<p>Medi-Cal patients are subject to limited reimbursement of
narcotics, and these limits must be addressed. I have had limited
income Medi-Cal patients who are forced to choose between buying
pain agents and other necessities. For example, reimbursement is
limited to acetaminophen and aspirin with codeine. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Law Enforcement Agencies, including the
Enforcement Divisions of Regulatory Bodies, to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Publish and circulate the enforcement philosophy and state
board guidelines (such as those recently issued by the Medical
Board of California) to reduce fear of inappropriate punishment
among ethical members of the medical community and to increase
fear of discipline or arrest among those diverting narcotics for
nontherapeutic uses. </p>

<p><b>Other Input for Law Enforcement Agencies, Including the
Enforcement Divisions of Regulatory Bodies, to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Punish only those who really need punishment. Read and enforce
the spirit of the law, rather than fostering fear of the letter
of the law. </p>

<p>Experts in pain management must communicate with regulators
and law enforcement professionals to curb abuses. </p>

<p>Diversion may not be as big a problem as many think. A
pharmacist in a San Diego hospital once estimated that the legal
supplies of all opioids in the pharmacies in San Diego would not
supply San Diego street addicts for twenty four hours. </p>

<p>Ongoing, mandatory interagency cooperation is essential. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Manufacturers to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Participants felt drug manufacturers should be full members of
any coalition interested in finding more effective treatments for
people in pain. Participants recommended that manufacturers
should be more proactive in educating patients, including
developing better, more readable drug information, consumer
bulletins, and telephone services. </p>

<p>These recommendations included: </p>

<p>Have health care providers and consumer advocacy groups
provide manufacturers with input on what types of consumer
information to develop. For example: print inserts in large type,
develop simpler language, include benefits not just potential
complications, and sponsor consumer bulletins. </p>

<p>Provide telephone assistance numbers so that patients can
contact knowledgeable health professionals in addition to their
primary health care provider, or give patients the names of
advisory groups and consumer advocacy groups. </p>

<p>Expedite delivery of pain medication to the patient, which
will require improved efficiency of tracking mechanisms with
federal and state regulators, especially for emergency supplies
of medication. One participant noted a patient w as denied
emergency supplies of medication that were legally prescribed
because of a typographical error on the IDEA form 222. DEA's
enforcement penalties are overly punitive for minor record
keeping discrepancies. </p>

<p>Broaden the manufacturers' role in professional education,
from specific use of medication to basic pain management skills. </p>

<p>Note that manufacturers can and do support legislative efforts
as well as outcomes research. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>PRIOR AND ONGOING PAIN MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES</b> </p>

<p>1990 </p>

<p>Senator Leroy Greene sponsored the Intractable Pain Treatment
Act in 1990, making California the second state to specifically
recognize by statute the importance of the use of controlled
substances in the treatment of intractable pain. </p>

<p>1992 </p>

<p>In December 1992, a professional symposium on pain management,
including regulatory impediments, was held at the University of
California at San Francisco. </p>

<p>Senator Robert Presley sponsored a resolution that established
the Controlled Substances Prescription Advisory Council (Council)
to examine the triplicate prescription program, alternative
methods of monitoring and enforcing the laws, and regulations
governing drug diversion. </p>

<p>1993 </p>

<p>Senator Leroy Greene sponsored legislation in 1993 that
requires the Medical Board of California to ensure that its
licensees are made aware of the Intractable Pain Treatment Act
and federal clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of
acute, post-surgical, and cancer pain. </p>

<p>Assembly Member Jack O'Connell sponsored Assembly Concurrent
Resolution (ACR) 34 in 1993. The resolution directs the Medical
Board of California to conduct and complete a survey of medical
school curricula to determine whether medical students receive
adequate training in pain management and palliative care of the
terminally ill. The resolution also directs the Board to
determine whether physicians and surgeons adequately understand
pain management and palliative care for the terminally ill and to
report their recommendations to the Legislature for modifications
in medical school curricula to ensure physicians and surgeons
have adequate training this area. </p>

<p>In December 1993, the Council issued a landmark report,
recommending the implementation of electronic monitoring of
controlled substances prescriptions in place of the triplicate
prescription program and numerous reforms of laws, regulations,
and practices governing drug diversion monitoring, investigation,
and enforcement. It recognized the importance of using controlled
substances for medical purposes and the problem of undertreating
pain as well as the problem of abuse of controlled substances. </p>

<p>In early 1993, a forum on pain management and regulatory
issues was proposed and was in initial planning stages at the
Department of Consumer Affairs, when the Medical Board of
California's task force issued its report. </p>

<p>In February 1993, the University of California at Los Angeles
held a symposium on barriers to effective health care; in October
1993, a similar program entitled &quot;Cancer Pain, Opiates and
the Law' was held at the California Cancer Center in Fresno. In
November 1993, a similar program was held at Cedars-Sinai in Los
Angeles, at which time the Southern California Cancer Pain
Initiative was organized. </p>

<p>During 1993, the Medical Board of California established a
task force on appropriate prescribing. Its report recommended
that a pain forum be held and that the Board create a statement
on the need for effective pain management. [The draft statement
was circulated to Summit attendees, and the final statement -was
adopted in May 1994 (see attachment); the Board is now adopting
Guidelines for Pain Management; the Board of Registered Nursing
has also adopted a policy and curriculum guidelines on pain
management (see attachment); the Board of Pharmacy is in the
process of doing so.] </p>

<p>Assembly Member Richard Polanco sponsored Assembly Bill (AB)
2155 in 1993 which would have established a pain management
committee to, among other things, clarify standards for
appropriate procedures and techniques for the management of
acute, chronic, or intractable pain, study the impact of the
triplicate prescription program on prescribing and dispensing for
pain, and examine the adverse impact of the undertreatment of
pain. </p>

<p>The Governor vetoed AB 2155 but agreed that the proponents of
such a committee made: &quot;...a compelling argument that the
medical community and law enforcement community need to work
together in a cooperative fashion to make certain patients are
receiving medically necessary pain treatment..... </p>

<p>The Governor directed the State and Consumer Services Agency
to establish a committee with representatives from various health
boards to work with the Attorney General &quot;...on appropriate
pain management procedures and recommendations on how to overcome
the obstacles that contribute to inadequate pain management.' </p>

<p>1994 </p>

<p>The March 18, 1994 Effective Pain Management Summit is the
result of the Governor's mandate, and a culmination of the many
other activities and legislation described above. </p>

<p>The Medical Board of California, along with the California
Medical Association, the Board of Pharmacy, the Board of Dental
Examiners, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Department of
Consumer Affairs, and the State and Consumer Services Agency
became sponsors of the Summit on Effective Pain Management.<br>

<p>REFERENCES </p>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Millions of Americans suffer from pain. Among the most tragic
victims are those whose lives are consumed by chronic,
intractable pain. </p>

<p>Although narcotics can frequently help, they are typically
avoided or given at inadequate levels. A number of factors are
involved, including the fear of patient addiction and the threat
of disciplinary action f or overprescribing. In addition, pain is
difficult for the patient to describe and the physician to
evaluate. </p>

<p>Whatever the reason, the result is often unnecessary
suffering. Evidence is steadily accumulating that persons with
intractable pain do not respond to narcotics in the same way as
do street addicts. Their motivations are different, and so are
their psychological reactions and tolerances to the drugs. The
pain patient can be treated with narcotics with little risk of
developing the self-destructive behavior characteristic of
addiction--even though dosages may sometimes far exceed the
&quot;normal.&quot; </p>

<p>The public needs to know that more can and should be done for
those people with chronic pain. </p>

<p>THE PAINFUL DILEMMA </p>

<p>Albert Schweitzer once said: </p>

<p>&quot;We must all die. But if I can save him from days of
torture, that is what I feel is my great and ever new privilege.
Pain is a more terrible lord of mankind than even death
itself.&quot; </p>

<p>Everybody has suffered from pain--especially the intense acute
Pain that flares up when a toe is stubbed or a finger burned.
That pain soon goes away. But at least 20 million Americans
suffer from chronic pain that lasts for weeks or months--or may
never go away. Most of its victims are the middle-aged and the
elderly. </p>

<p>The most common form is low back pain, which arises from
osteoartharitis or other causes, and is estimated to afflict 15
percent of the population. Cancer patients often suffer severe
pain as their condition worsens. Burn victims may have
excruciating pain during recovery. Chronic pain includes tension
and migraine headaches. Individuals with arthritis often suffer
from chronic pain. </p>

<p>In fact, chronic pain is one of the nation's most costly
health problems. The price tag each year comes to nearly $50
billion for medical costs, lost income, lost productivity,
compensation payments and legal costs. </p>

<p>To the individual, the impact can be devastating both
personally and professionally. Severe pain can impair sleep and
appetite, and it can trigger anxiety, frustration and depression.
Over time, pain can lower self-esteem and bring on significant
psychological problems. Pain can destroy the will to live. </p>

<p>As common as it is, pain can be extremely elusive. The patient
may have difficulty describing it, and the physician often cannot
substantiate it. An individual in acute pain may scream and
writhe in agony; but the person with chronic pain often appears
outwardly normal, with few visible signs. </p>

<p>Although much remains to be learned about the mechanism of
pain, we know individuals have different levels of tolerance to
pain. There are also differences in individual sensitivity to
drugs, and in how drugs are metabolized. Studies indicate that
pain relief from opiates varies by age, race, cultural
differences, type of pain and location of pain. </p>

<p>Because the effectiveness of pain medication varies greatly
from person to person, a patient's need for a high dose is not
necessarily a sign of addiction. </p>

<p><b>Treatment of pain</b> </p>

<p>A variety of methods are used to treat chronic pain. They may
include acupuncture, biofeedback and other relaxation techniques,
physical therapy, psychotherapy, hypnosis, behavior modification,
nerve block by injection and transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation (TENS). In addition, cancer patients who suffer pain
may benefit from radiation therapy. Surgery can alter the
perception of pain, modify conduction of pain along pathways of
the central nervous system, or, as a last resort, block pain by
cutting nerve bundles. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents,
antidepressants and anticonvulsants are among the medications
that can be used. </p>

<p>Despite the variety of treatments available, a substantial
number of pain patients are not helped. Even some of those
'successfully treated must learn to live with pain. </p>

<p>Narcotics are extremely effective for pain relief, but their
long term use has been avoided because of the potential for
addiction. Included are &quot;opiates&quot; like morphine and
codeine, which are derived from opium, and &quot;opioids&quot;
like heroin and methadone, which are synthetic or semi-synthetic
compounds with similar properties. </p>

<p>Opiate therapy is now generally used for burn victims and
terminal cancer patients, and for shorter periods for hospital
patients who have undergone surgery. The standard prescription is
PRN (pro re nata, or &quot;as needed&quot;). In effect the order
means medication is to be given only after pain returns. </p>

<p>However, by the time the pain is treated, it may be so severe
that a larger dose, with greater side effects, is needed.
Undertreatment can occur when surgery patients have a longer
course of recovery than normal, and for young patients. </p>

<p><b>Regulatory efforts</b> </p>

<p>Narcotic analgesics are noted not only for their ability to
relieve pain--but- also for their widespread abuse. </p>

<p>Attempts to curtail drug abuse have led to a wide range of law
enforcement activities. One of the most visible in the medical
setting is the system of triplicate prescriptions required for a
number of drugs. One copy of a prescription is retained by the
physician, a second sent to the pharmacist, and the third to the
Drug Enforcement Agency. Triplicate prescriptions are frequently
used to identify physicians who may be overprescribing. </p>

<p>Overprescribing of narcotics, stimulants and other drugs
accounts for almost 20 percent of the disciplinary actions taken
by the Medical Board of California (or MBC, formerly the Board of
Medical Quality Assurance). </p>

<p>In 1982, the physician who was then the MBC's medical
consultant declared in an interview sent out to all licensed
physicians in California: </p>

<p>&quot;We have two kinds of doctors who get into trouble (for
overprescribing narcotics)--'script doctors' and 'well
intentioned' doctors. The 'well-intentioned' doctor may appear as
a 'nice guy, I but he is really naive or, in some cases, not
keeping up with present day prescribing standards. The 'script
doctor' is one who usually knows he is breaking the law and
writes prescriptions for controlled substances purely for
profit.&quot; </p>

<p>He gave no indication that prescribing high amounts of
narcotics over the long term might be acceptable. </p>

<p><b>The traditional view</b> </p>

<p>The interview reflected the traditional view that long-term
narcotics use by anyone inevitably leads to addiction: the body
learns to tolerate the drugs, and demands ever escalating doses;
abuse begins as a search for euphoria, and eventually conditioned
reflexes cause an irresistible craving for the narcotic. This
escapist-conditioning explanation dominated medical thinking and
public health policy for three decades and is still widely held. </p>

<p>For example, a June, 1990, issue of the Mayo Clinic's Medical
Essay newsletter warns: </p>

<p>&quot;Opiates can cause drowsiness, nausea, constipation and
mood changes. In addition ' extended use of opiates can lead to
tolerance--the body becomes accustomed to certain amounts of the
drug and no longer responds as well to it. Because of the
inevitable addiction that accompanies chronic opiate use, their
use in treating pain should be extremely limited.&quot; </p>

<p>There are problems with that point of view. Some so-called
&quot;chippers&quot; who abuse drugs occasionally do not. become
addicted. </p>

<p>Many veterans of the Vietnam War used narcotics extensively
while overseas, but abruptly discontinued use after returning
home without subsequent readdiction. </p>

<p>It was discovered that long-term addicts could be maintained
with methadone at a high, though stable, dose. Individuals could
then function with minimal side effects. </p>

<p>Experience with cancer patients led to a major change in
thinking. Except for an initial increase in dose, there was
little evidence of growing tolerance to narcotics. </p>

<p>&quot;The cancer patient has thus served as a model to
demonstrate that opioids can be used on a chronic basis in
patients with pain, and this insight has given a greater insight
into the clinical pharmacology effects of these drugs,&quot;
writes neurologist Kathleen Foley in a 1990 monograph on pain
management. &quot;For example, chronic use of opioids in the
cancer patient has demonstrated that physical dependence occurs,
but psychological dependence or 'addiction' is rare, if not
nonexistent.&quot; </p>

<p>Many addicts claim to have been hooked by medical care, and
older studies indicated perhaps 10 percent of addicts started off
that way. However, a major study in 1980 showed abuse developed
in only 4 of 11,882 patients given opiates while hospitalized; in
only one instance was the abuse considered major. </p>

<p>In recent years, self-infusion pumps have been introduced
which allow patients after surgery to give themselves limited
doses of narcotics to control pain. There were fears the process
would create a new population of drug addicts. Instead, the
amount of narcotics used by patients has been the same or less
than under the old PRN method. </p>

<p><b>Emerging concepts</b> </p>

<p>It now seems clear there is a major difference between addicts
seeking euphoria and individuals seeking relief from pain. The
traditional perception is that the reactions of street addicts
are simply a more extreme expression of what happens to chronic
pain patients. </p>

<p>However, drug addicts behave as if obtaining and using drugs
are primary drives--akin to eating, sleeping or sex. They take
drugs to get high and are frequently lost to themselves, their
families and society. </p>

<p>In contrast, the person with chronic pain takes drugs to
return to normal and to get on with life. Narcotics allow
individuals with pain to interact with their families and to
return to work. Pain patients overcome most of the side effects
of the narcotics. </p>

<p>The pain patient's entire behavior is aimed at getting relief
from pain, just as the addict's efforts are aimed at obtaining
drugs. Unlike an addict, the typical pain patient experiences
little or no euphoria from narcotics. Except for an initial
increase in dosage, there is little indication of increasing
tolerance. Withdrawing from drugs is a major hurdle for addicts,
but for the pain patient withdrawal is typically uncomplicated. </p>

<p>Why the different reaction to opiates? chronic pain signals
travel to the brain by a different nerve pathway than do sudden
or &quot;Phasic&quot; pain signals. One prominent researcher
believes the chronic pathway develops relatively little tolerance
to morphine, so does not demand constantly escalating doses. </p>

<p><b>New definitions of abuse</b> </p>

<p>Along with recent medical developments have come redefinitions
of the key terms of drug abuse. All long-term users of narcotics
become physically dependent: if drugs are suddenly discontinued,
their bodies react with sweating, aches, nausea or other
withdrawal symptoms. That physical dependence was once virtually
synonymous with addiction, but is no longer. </p>

<p>The American Society of Addiction Medicine now defines
addiction as the abuse of any psychoactive substance with
compulsion and loss of control despite adverse consequences. </p>

<p>Similarly, an American Medical Association Task Force
describes addiction as a chronic disorder characterized by
&quot;the compulsive use of a substance-resulting in physical,
psychological or social harm to the user and continued use
despite the harm.&quot; &quot;Psychological dependence,&quot;
which emphasizes the compulsive use of drugs, is now often used
interchangeably with the term addiction. </p>

<p>Under the older definition, anyone who became physically
dependent could be viewed as an &quot;addict&quot;--including the
pain patient on narcotics. The newer definition distinguishes
between the pain patient trying to put a life back together and
the self-destructive addict trying to achieve euphoria. </p>

<p><b>Physicians and pain patients</b> </p>

<p>Despite the changing perceptions of pain and addiction,
physicians are generally ambivalent about the use of narcotics.
Most physicians were trained under older concepts of drug
addiction--as are many current medical students. Pain experts
today still disagree about the proper use of narcotics. </p>

<p>Even a supposedly safe practice--giving narcotics to terminal
cancer patients--has its own quandaries. It is sometimes
criticized for placing medical care nearer to euthanasia. In a
highly publicized case in early 1990, the morphine-related deaths
of two terminally ill patients in the Minneapolis area were ruled
by the coroner to be homicides. </p>

<p>There is constant pressure for more discipline of physicians.
A recent example is a draft report of the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services which says data strongly suggest
&quot;the universe of potentially actionable events far exceeds
the number of disciplinary actions actually imposed by the
(state) boards.&quot; </p>

<p>Physicians are also aware of the ongoing disciplinary actions
against doctors for overprescribing drugs, usually narcotics. </p>

<p>As a consequence, many physicians simply limit the amount of
narcotics they will prescribe f or any one pain patient. Some
physicians even shy away from using any triplicate forms. The
forms are a paperwork nuisance and a red flag of danger. Not
having them is also a convenient excuse for not treating pain
patients. </p>

<p>Few doctors welcome patients who complain of chronic pain.
Pain patients often appear normal, so the physician cannot be
sure of the extent or validity of the complaints. The patients
are often difficult, manipulative or depressed. High levels of
medication to relieve pain invite disciplinary problems for the
physician. </p>

<p>Most physicians prescribe narcotics only f or chronic pain
patients they have treated for a number of years. Patients
receiving such medication face a major problem if they move to a
new area or their physician retires. New physicians will be
extremely reluctant to treat them. </p>

<p><b>Political developments</b> </p>

<p>The environment in which physicians and patients now find
themselves was captured by the theme of the October, 1989,
meeting of the American Pain Society, &quot;Relieving Pain in a
Regulated Environment--a Medical Dilemma for the 90's. &quot; The
meeting focused on the difficulties in treatment caused by the
ongoing war on drugs. </p>

<p>The Texas Legislature confronted the problem in 1989 by
enacting a law which defined &quot;intractable pain,&quot; added
to state law language from federal law recognizing the legitimate
medical use of dangerous drugs, and restricted discipline of
physicians for treating chronic intractable pain. </p>

<p>The California Legislature acted in 1989 as well, passing
senator Leroy Greene's SB 711 to set down new requirements before
the Board of Medical Quality Assurance (now known as the Medical
Board of California or MBC) could discipline a physician for
overprescribing. The Board would have to consider the physical
and mental condition of the patient, whether the patient had
intractable pain, whether there was evidence of drug addiction or
abuse, and whether the medication caused physical or
psychological harm to the patient. </p>

<p>However, the bill was vetoed at the Medical Board's urging.
The governor said he shared the board's concern the law would
reduce its ability to discipline physicians: &quot;By requiring
that the Board's investigations take into account certain
specific characteristics of the patient, particularly where the
patient may not be willing to cooperate for fear of losing a
supply of drugs, the bill places a significant new burden of
proof on the Board in its efforts to discipline physicians who
are excessive providers.&quot; </p>

<p>The Governor also pointed to the war on drugs: &quot;I believe
at a time when illicit access and use of drugs is a major problem
for our citizens, this bill's provisions are a step in the wrong
.direction.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1990, Senator Greene took a different, successful tack with
SB 1802. The bill said physicians could not be disciplined for
prescribing controlled substances to control &quot;intractable
pain.&quot; The Medical Board found the bill more acceptable than
the previous measure, but still thought there was no problem and
no need for legislation. </p>

<p>SB 1802 defined &quot;intractable pain&quot; as &quot;a pain
state in which the cause of the pain cannot be removed or
otherwise treated and which in the generally accepted course of
medical practice no relief or cure of the cause of the pain is
possible or none has been found after reasonable efforts
including, but not limited to, evaluation by one or more
physicians and surgeons specializing in the treatment of the
area, system, or organ of the body perceived as the source of the
pain. </p>

<p>The bill was signed into law by the Governor on September 30,
1990. Looking ahead </p>

<p>Hopefully, measures like the Greene bill will allow physicians
to better treat the patient disabled by chronic pain. one key
provision of that law requires consultation with other experts. </p>

<p>In addition, physicians should consider long-term narcotics
only after other reasonable attempts at pain relief have failed.
Patients should be seen and prescriptions given at regular
intervals. Physicians must be wary of the patient with a history
of drug abuse, the patient who does not have some initial relief
with relatively low doses of pain medication, or the patient who
hoards drugs or shows uncontrolled escalation of drug use. </p>

<p>Pain patients should be made aware of the risk of long-term
narcotic use. But those who need narcotics should understand that
physical dependence does not inevitably lead to addiction. The
odds are decidedly against addiction in the self-destructive
sense. </p>

<p>The medical community, regulatory bodies and the public need
to know that more can and should be done for treatment of chronic
pain. The emerging evidence indicates we can safely offer
patients more for pain than to &quot;learn to live with it.&quot;

<h1>Anatomy of a pain summit</h1>

<p>NOVEMBER 1994 - SACRAMENTO MEDICINE </p>

<p><b>By Harvey L. Rose, MD</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>In the fall of 1990, three events signaled a new era in the
use of opioids for the management of chronic pain -- particularly
non-malignant pain: </p>

<p>(1) SEDMS published &quot;The Painful Dilemma: The Use of
Narcotics for the Treatment of Chronic Pain;&quot; </p>

<p>(2) Governor Deukmejian signed into law Senator Leroy Greene's
SB 1802, the Intractable Pain Act, which protects physicians from
unwarranted intrusion by regulatory agencies in the treatment of
chronic pain with controlled substances. Under this law, a
physician cannot be disciplined by the Medical Board for such
treatment as long as a consultation was obtained from an
appropriate specialist and good records were maintained on the
patient; </p>

<p>(3) The AMA published &quot;Balancing the Response to
Prescription Drug Abuse,&quot; after becoming aware of the
problem. As Dr. James Sammons stated, &quot;The war on drugs
should not be a war on patients.&quot; But it has been a war on
patients and physicians alike. </p>

<p>In November 1990, I gave testimony before the Medical Board of
California (MBQ and asked them to communicate to the physicians
of this state through their Action Report the significance of the
year's prior events. Finally, in June 1991, the Action Report
carried an article on the use of controlled substances for the
management of chronic pain. While the article did mention Senator
Greene's bill, no mention was made of &quot;The Painful
Dilemma.&quot; </p>

<p>In October 1992, Senator Greene held hearings at the State
Capitol regarding the Intractable Pain Treatment Act because he
was receiving calls from doctors informing him that the
regulatory climate had not improved at all. At the hearing,
physicians and patients testified about the problems they
encountered with prescribing and obtaining controlled substances
for chronic pain, but the Medical Board refused to admit there
was any problem. On October 27, The Sacramento Bee reported
&quot;Legal Fears have Doctors Under-prescribing
Painkillers,&quot; and the following day Ken Wagstaff resigned as
director of the MBC over an internal scandal. Governor Wilson
subsequently appointed Dixon Arnett, a former Republican
assemblyman, to head the MBC. Senator Greene, who knew Arnett
from their days in the legislature, met with him and expressed
his concerns. Arnett, through friends who had encountered
difficulty getting medication for the relief of chronic pain, was
aware of the problem and set up a task force to look into the
situation. In its November 4, 1993 report, the task force
recognized that the undertreatment of chronic pain was a greater
problem than so-called &quot;excessive prescribing.&quot; After
several hearings, the task force's statement on prescribing
controlled substances for chronic pain was published in the July
1994 Action Report (the guidelines are to be published in an
upcoming action report). In reference to the report, Arnett was
quoted in The Bee (8/11/94), saying &quot;Doctors won't have the
Medical Board to blame anymore(for undertreatment of pain).&quot;
In addition, Arnett said in his letter to task force members that
he wanted physicians to achieve a certain level of comfort when
it comes to prescribing these drugs. </p>

<p>In November, Proposition 161, &quot;Physician Assisted
Suicide,&quot; appeared on the state ballot. A coalition of
religious groups strongly opposed to the initiative spent large
sums of money to defeat it, which they did, 54:46 percent. These
groups came to realize that suicide was not the real issue at
stake; rather, it was the pain. Cavalier and Associates, the same
group that ran that campaign against Proposition 161 formed the
California Pain Management Coalition. They worked with
Assemblyman Richard Polanco, who introduced AB 2155 calling for a
pain management advisory committee within the attorney general's
office to advise on pain matters. The wife of an administrative
assistant to Assemblyman Polanco had chronic pain and had
experienced difficulty obtaining pain relief. Her doctors had
been afraid of her getting &quot;addicted&quot; to opioids, but I
maintain it was really the scarlet letter of &quot;arrest&quot;
that kept her from getting what she needed to alleviate her pain.
</p>

<p>AB 2155 passed that state legislature but was vetoed by
Governor Wilson. In his veto message, however, the governor
called for a pain summit to remove the impediments to adequate
prescribing: &quot;The proponents [of AB 21551 make a compelling
argument that the medical community and the law enforcement
community need to work together in a cooperative fashion to make
certain patients are receiving medically necessary pain
treatment. I am directing ... the various boards... to overcome
obstacles that contribute to inadequate pain management.&quot;
10/8/93 </p>

<p>In 1989, the American Pain Society (APS) formed a new
committee on analgesic regulatory issues. Ronald Blum, MD, chief
of oncology at New York University, was the committee's first
chairman. In 1987, Dr. Blum had been arrested in his office by
narcotic agents for alleged overprescribing of Diluadid to his
cancer patients. </p>

<p>They finally reduced the charges against him to not
registering his patients is &quot;ilarcotic addicts&quot; as
required by New York law. The second chair of this committee was
Al Brady, MD, an oncologist from Portland, Oregon who had also
been arrested on charges similar to Dr. Blum's. As a member of
this committee, I worked with C. Stratton Hill, MD, head of
oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He was the
author of The Intractable Pain Treatment Act, which had become
law in Texas in 1989. We adopted this law, made a few changes,
and it became law in California the next year. </p>

<p>William Marcus, deputy attorney general in the Los Angeles
office, became a member of the APS' analgesic regulatory
committee and gained awareness of how regulatory agencies had
created a climate that was not conducive to prescribing narcotics
for chronic pain patients. </p>

<p>The pain summit was held in Los Angeles in March 1994 with
Senator Greene, as well as experts from all over the country in
medicine, nursing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and law
enforcement, in attendance. At about the same time, the Agency
for Health Care Policy Research came out with cancer pain
guidelines, acknowledging that at least half of all cancer
patients are undertreated for pain. Certainly, addiction should
not be an issue in deciding how much pain relief cancer patients
can receive. The report on the pain summit, which was released in
July 1994, stated that patients had a right to relief of their
pain and suffering. The following was the only underlined
statement in the summit report: &quot;We should create by statute
a positive legal duty for physicians to relieve pain.&quot;
Included in the summit report was a chronology of events that had
led up to the summit. The first event listed was Senator Greene's
Intractable Pain Treatment Act. </p>

<p>In June 1994, the 6th District Court of Appeals published a
decision in the Peopic vs. Schade case. Among other charges, Dr.
Schade was accused of illegally prescribing controlled substances
to addicts (of course, these so-called addicts were actually
chronic pain patients). Dr. Otto Neubuerger and I testified on
Dr. Schade's behalf. One of the pivotal issues as seen by the
court of appeals was the definition of addiction. In 1989, SB
711, another bill by Senator Greene, included a definition of
addiction. It was passed by the legislature but vetoed
by.Governor Deukmejian. </p>

<p>The appellate court felt that if the trial court could not
provide a definition of addiction, then how could it convict Dr.
Schade for treating addicts? It overturned that part of Dr.
Schade's conviction by 2:1. While the dissenting justice felt
that Dr. Schade still should have been found guilty, he caught
the essence of tile problem in his opinion: &quot;To be sure,
there was abundant and divergent testimony during the course of
this trial devoted to the meaning of addiction as that concept
relates to pain management. It was apparent that the medical
community is divided on the question of the appropriate use of
narcotics for treatment of patients in chronic pain. One thing
made clear by the expert testimony is that there is no commonly
accepted medical standard by which to measure how much is too
much to prescribe for any given patient presenting with the
complaint of chronic pain. As appellant testified, each case will
depend upon the doctor's assessment of the particular patient's
level of comfort and ability of function.&quot; (Daily Appellate
Report, 6/17/94:8291). </p>

<p>Part of my own testimony, quoted in the appellate courts
decision, reads as follows: &quot;Dr. Rose testified that he has
prescribed narcotics to chronic pain patients with nonmalignant
ailments. According to Dr. Rose, the quality of life is the
bottom line and the doctor should be able to prescribe narcotics.
when necessary to restore function in the patients' lives.&quot;
(DAR, 6/17/94:8275). </p>

<p>With the virtually simultaneous release of the Medical Board's
task force statement and the governor's pain summit report this
year, there is no turning back. Once the full implementation of
these documents is realized, California will become the first
political unit on the planet where the undertreatment of pain and
suffering will be considered illegal. All members of the health
care team will have not only a professional obligation but a
statutory positive legal duty to effectively relieve their
patients' pain and suffering, and no longer will physicians have
to tell their patients in pain to &quot;just learn to live with
it.&quot;<br>

AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">The Agency for Health Care Administration, in
consultation with the Florida Pain Commission, the Florida Board
of Medicine and the Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine,
endorses the following practice parameter or guideline pursuant
to the Florida Health Care and Insurance Reform Act of 1993,
Chapter 93-129, Laws of Florida; Florida Statutes s.
408.02&#151;Practice Parameters--of the Health Care
Administration Act; and Florida Statutes s. 458.326--Intractable
Pain; Authorized Treatment--of the Medical Practice Act. This
practice parameter has been approved as a working document by the
Florida Board of Medicine and the Florida Board of Osteopathic
Medicine.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">This guideline is published for information,
education and review by the medical community, other
professionals and the public. This practice guideline has been
created in recognition that some dangerous drugs, including
controlled substances under schedules II-V as provided in Florida
Statutes s. 893.03, can be vital in the treatment of pain,
including intractable pain. They are useful for relieving and
controlling many other pain related symptoms.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">These drugs may be prescribed for the treatment
of pain and related symptoms as a result of a prudent medical
diagnosis, in proper doses and for appropriate lengths of time,
which in some cases, may be for as long as the pain or related
symptoms exist.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">Pain, and many of the symptoms associated with
intractable pain, can result in subjective complaints and the
appropriateness and the adequacy of drug and drug doses will vary
from patient to patient. The physician is expected to exercise
sound medical judgment in treating pain and its related symptoms
with dangerous drugs and controlled substances.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">This generic guideline applies primarely (sic)
to the treatment of chronic and intractable pain with the use of
dangerous drugs and controlled substances. At the end of the
text, there are additional Agency for Health Care Administration
endorsed guidelines that target pain management. These guidelines
contain information about the management of specific acute and
chronic pain and injury conditions using prescription drugs,
controlled substances and other modalities. The guidelines also
contain the mandated scientific base for this generic pain
management guideline.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">Guidelines are not intended to be used as fixed
protocols. They are parameters for patient management strategies
which are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of
reasonable care that can achieve comparable results. They do
permit the consideration of the unique exigencies of each
individual and available resources. Many patients will require
more or less treatment to achieve relief from pain.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">Treatment must be based on patient need as well
as professional judgment. Therefore, these guidelines can be
tailored to fit distinctive patient needs that are affected by
the medical setting, the available resources and by other
factors. Deviations can be justified by individual circumstances.
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">While standards are intended to be rigid and
mandatory, making exceptions rare and troublesome to justify,
guidelines are more flexible, but it is advisable they be
followed as closely as is prudent. Guidelines are revisited every
three years or less and reviews are based on scientific updates.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">FLORIDA GENERIC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE</font></p>

<p><font size="3">MANAGEMENT OF PAIN USING DANGEROUS DRUGS AND
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">PART I</font></p>

<p><font size="3">PREFACE</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">The State of Florida recognizes that pain,
including intractable pain, is often undertreated. Unrelieved
pain can have harsh and sometimes disastrous influence on the
quality of life for patients and their families.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">PAIN MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY IN
FLORIDA</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Principles of quality medical practice dictate
that citizens of Florida who suffer from pain should seek
relief-with treatment that is currently available. The
appropriate application of current knowledge and treatments can
greatly improve the quality of life for many Florida citizens and
reduce the morbidity and costs associated with untreated pain. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">In addition to promoting competent patient
care, these guidelines are intended to help physicians avoid
investigation if controlled substances are appropriately
prescribed for short or long-term pain management.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">PRESCRIBING DANGEROUS DRUGS AND CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCES FOR PAIN </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The proper treatment for any patient's pain
depends upon a careful diagnosis of the etiology of the pain,
selection of appropriate and cost effective treatments and the
ongoing evaluations of the results of treatment. Patients with
chronic pain may demand more time of the practitioner because of
the complexity of their problem. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Opioid analgesics and other dangerous and
controlled substances are useful for pain treatment. They are the
cornerstone of treatment for acute pain due to trauma or surgery
and of chronic pain due to progressive diseases, such as cancer.
Other than that specified in the Physician's Desk Reference
(PDR), large doses, if documented, may be necessary to control
severe pain. Extended therapy may also be needed to alleviate
chronic pain. Published formularies, relating to commercial
financial incentives, should not be a deterrent to achieving
optimal pain relief.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Opioid analgesics may also be useful in
treating patients with intractable nonmalignant pain especially
when efforts to remove or treat the pain with other modalities
have failed. Such intractable pain may have a number of different
etiologies and might require several treatment methods. In
addition, the extent to which pain is associated with physical
and psychosocial impairment varies greatly. Therefore, when
patients are selected for therapy trials using dangerous drugs
and opioid therapy, care should be used to assess the pain as
well as the patient's disability. The duration of drug therapy
should depend on the physician's evaluation of the results of
treatment, including the degree of pain relief, the changes in
physical and psychological functioning and the appropriate
utilization of health care resources. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Addiction in relation to these substances
should be placed in proper perspective. Physical dependence and
tolerance are normal physiological consequences of extended
opioid therapy and are not the same as addiction. Addiction is a
behavioral syndrome characterized by psychological dependence and
aberrant, drug-related behaviors. Addicts use drugs in a
compulsive manner and not for medical purposes. An addict may
also be physically dependent or tolerant. Patients with chronic
pain should not be considered addicts merely because they are
being treated with opioids. Physicians need to be cognizant of
the fact that patients with a history of drug abuse may be
particularly problematic to the management of pain. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">PAIN MANAGEMENT, CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND THE
LAW</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Federal government laws and regulations and
those of the State of Florida impose special requirements for
dangerous drugs and controlled substances prescription. These
regulations are aimed at preventing harm to the consurner from
dangerous prescription drugs which are diverted to nonmedical
uses. It is legitimate medical practice for physicians to
prescribe controlled substances for the treatment of pain,
including intractable pain. The Agency for Health Administration
supports the examination of prescriptions for analgesics and
opioids for the treatment of pain. This examination must be based
on the documented diagnosis and treatment rather than on the drug
dosage or on the number of prescriptions written. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Concerns about regulatory scrutiny should not
cause physicians to be reluctant to prescribe or administer
dangerous and controlled substances, including Schedules II-V
drugs as provided for in Florida Statutes s. 893.03, for patients
with legitimate medical needs. Physicians need not fear
administrative action when prescribing dangerous drugs and
controlled substances to patients in their care for a pathology
or condition when the prescription is issued after a good faith
examination and there is medical indication for the prescription.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The regulatory boards may identify a pattern of
dangerous and controlled substance use which merits further
examination, but private, courteous and professional inquiry can
usually determine whether the physician is appropriately
prescribing for patients in good faith or whether an
investigation is warranted. The Florida Board of Medicine and the
Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine must judge the prescription
validity relative to the physician's documented diagnosis and
treatment and if the prescribed drugs are appropriate for the
patient's condition. Predetermined limits should not be placed on
dosages or length of drug therapy. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">It is the goal of the Agency for Health Care
Administration to change practitioner perception of regulatory
scrutiny and recognize the commitment of regulatory boards to
improving pain management in order to enhance the quality of
lives of pain-affected patients in Florida. Federal and State
laws and regulatory policies should not hamper the appropriate
use of dangerous drugs and controlled substances for the relief
of pain. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">PART II</font></p>

<p><font size="3">PRACTICE AND REGULATORY GUIDELINES</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">The Florida Board of Medicine and the Florida
Board of Osteopathic Medicine may use the following guidelines to
determine whether conduct violates the physician's respective
practice act, including Florida Statutes s. 458.326--Intractable
Pain; Authorized Treatment--of the Florida Medical Practice Act,
below, in regard to prescribing, administering, ordering or the
dispensing of pain medications and other drugs and to address
their side effects.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">Excerpted from Florida Statutes Chapter 458,
Medical Practice</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">Florida Statutes s. 458.326 - Intractable pain;
authorized treatment. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(1) For the purposes of this section, the term
&quot;intractable pain&quot; means pain for which, in the
generally accepted course of medical practice, the cause cannot
be removed and otherwise treated.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(2) Intractable pain must be diagnosed by a
physician licensed under this chapter and qualified by experience
to render such diagnosis. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law,
a physician may prescribe or administer any controlled substance
under Schedules II-V, as provided for in</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(4) 893.03, to a person for the treatment of
intractable pain, provided the physician does so in accordance
with that level of care, skill, and treatment recognized by a
reasonably prudent physician under similar conditions and
circumstances.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed
to condone, authorize, or approve mercy killing or euthanasia,
and no treatment authorized by this section may be used for such
purpose. History.--s. 3, ch. 94-96.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">DEFINITIONS</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">INTRACTABLE PAIN - A pain state in which the
cause of the pain cannot be removed or otherwise treated and
which, in the generally accepted course of medical practice, no
relief or cure of the cause of the pain is possible or none has
been found after reasonable efforts.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">NONTHERAPEUTIC USE - A medical use or purpose
that is not legitimate in nature or in manner.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">ABUSER OF NARCOTIC DRUGS, CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
AND DANGEROUS DRUGS - An individual who takes a drug or drugs for
other than legitimate rnedical purposes.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">1. The treatment of pain, including intractable
pain, with dangerous drugs and controlled substances has a
legitimate medical purpose when performed in the usual course of
medical practice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">2. Physicians duly authorized to practice under
their respective practice act and to prescribe controlled
substances and dangerous drugs in Florida, shall not be subject
to disciplinary action by their respective licensure board for
prescribing, ordering, administering or dispensing dangerous
drugs or controlled substances for the treatment and relief of
pain, including intractable pain, in the usual course of
professional practice for a legitimate medical purpose in
compliance with applicable state and federal law.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">3. The prescribing, ordering, administering or
dispensing of dangerous drugs or controlled substances for pain
will be considered to be for a legitimate medical purpose if
based upon scientific knowledge of the treatment of pain,
including intractable pain; and are not in contravention of
applicable state and federal law, and if prescribed, ordered,
administered or dispensed in compliance with the following
guidelines where asoronnate and as is necessary to meet the
individual needs of the patient.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">A physician will be considered in compliance
if:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">a. The medication is prescribed after a
documented patient history and physical examination by the
physician prescribing or providing the medication, which
includes: an assessment and consideration of the physical and
psychological impact of the pain, any patient history or
potential for substance abuse, for coexisting diseases and
conditions and the prescience of a recognized medical indication
for the use of a dangerous drug or controlled substance.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">b. If medications are prescribed pursuant to a
written treatment plan tailored for the individual needs of the
patient and if treatment progress and success can be evaluated
with stated objectives such as pain relief and improved physical
and psychosocial function. Such a written treatment plan will
consider pertinent medical history and physical examination as
well as the need for further testing, consultations, referrals or
the use of other treatment modalities.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">c. The physician should discuss with the
patient, significant other(s) or legal guardian, if appropriate,
the risks, i.e., narcotic bowel syndrome (inforrnation attached),
addiction and other side effects in comparison to the benefits
from the use of dangerous and controlled substances.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">d. The patient will be subject to documented
periodic review of the care by the physician at reasonable
intervals and in view of the individual circumstances of the
patient in regard to progress toward reaching the stated
objectives. The review will take into consideration the course of
medications prescribed, ordered, administered or dispensed, as
well as any new information about the etiology of the pain.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">e. Complete and accurate records of the care
provided are kept as set forth in a-d, above. When controlled
substances are prescribed, records are made which include names,
quantities prescribed, dosages and number of authorized refills.
This record takes into account that pain-affected patients with a
history of substance abuse, or patients who live in an
environment that</font></p>

<p><font size="3">may pose a risk for medication misuse or
diversion, may require special consideration. Management of these
patients may warrant closer monitoring by the physician managing
the pain and require consultation with appropriate health care
professionals.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">4. A physician's decision not to adhere
strictly to the provisions of number 3, above, will not if
&quot;good faith or cause&quot; is shown, constitute grounds for
board disciplinary action. Each case of prescribing for pain will
be evaluated on an individual basis. The physician's conduct will
be evaluated to a great extent by the treatment outcome, taking
into account: 1/ whether the drug used is medically or
pharmacologically recognized to be appropriate for the diagnosis,
2/ the patient's individual needs, including any improvement in
functioning, and 3/ recognizing that some types of pain cannot be
completely relieved.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">5. If the provisions set out in numbers 1-4,
above, are met, and if all drug treatment is properly documented,
the board will consider such practices as prescribing in a
therapeutic manner, and as prescribing and practicing in a manner
consistent with public health and welfare. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">6. Quantity of pharmaceutical and chronicity of
the prescription will be evaluated on the basis of the documented
appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the recognized medical
indication. Documented persistence of the recognized medical
indication, and properly documented follow-up evaluations with
appropriate continuing care as set out in these guidelines, will
also be evaluated.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">7. A physician may use any number of treatment
modalities for the treatment of pain, including intractable pain,
which are consistent with legitimate medical purposes.</font></p>

<p> AU - Abram SE </p>

<p> TI - 1992 Bonica Lecture. Advances in chronic pain management
since gate control. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - OBJECTIVE. Two pain treatment systems that developed
soon after the publication of the gate theory are probably a
direct result of its publication: neuraxial opiate administration
and electrical stimulation of the spinal cord and peripheral
nerves and receptors. Although the use of these modalities has
become widespread in managing chronic pain, there is disagreement
about their long-term efficacy. This presentation will attempt to
review the data regarding the mechanisms of action of these
modalities and their efficacy in treating chronic pain of
malignant and nonmalignant origin. DATA SOURCES. Data were
derived almost entirely from original articles reporting
experimental data from both animal and human studies and from
series of patients undergoing treatment with the modalities
reviewed. STUDY SELECTION. Where possible, controlled studies
were selected. However, much of the available data regarding
treatment results are uncontrolled. DATA EXTRACTION AND
SYNTHESIS. Selected data from studies that were felt to be
reasonably well conducted are presented or summarized. Because of
the lack of control groups in many of the clinical trials,
meta-analyses were not carried out. CONCLUSIONS. Long-term spinal
opiate administration has been shown to be more effective than
systemic opiates in some patients with cancer pain, but often
must be combined with local anesthetics to provide satisfactory
pain relief. Loss of effect over time is a significant problem.
Since the identification of spinal opiate receptors and the
introduction of spinally administered narcotics, a number of
other receptors that are important in both sensitization and
suppression of pain projection systems have been characterized.
Agonists and antagonists to many of these receptors are being
developed, and a few are available for clinical trials. Long-term
electrical stimulation of the spinal cord produces substantial
analgesia below the stimulated spinal segments in some patients
with chronic pain. Although initial results are usually
encouraging, long-term efficacy may be disappointing. It is
postulated that analgesia associated with spinal stimulation is
associated with both stimulation of large fiber ascending tracts
and blockade of spinothalamic pathways. Transcutaneous electrical
nerve stimulation (TENS) has come into widespread use in managing
chronic pain and has had limited trials in cancer pain patients.
It is well accepted by patients and physicians, but clinical
studies of long-term efficacy have yielded variable results. The
analgesic action is probably the result of both large afferent
fiber activation and blockade of peripheral nociceptors.

<p> TI - Choosing the right analgesic. A guide to selection.
[Review] </p>

<p> AB - Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience,
unique to each individual patient. In the dynamic processes of
nociceptive stimulation, signal transmission, central decoding
and interpretation there are many potential sites for
pharmacological intervention, and there are many drugs which will
produce analgesia. An analgesic 'ladder' has been proposed for
rational pain relief in cancer and a similar concept should be
used in all forms of acute and chronic pain. Continuing research
and drug development undoubtedly extends our understanding, but
consistent improvement in our clinical ability to relieve pain
depends more on our willingness to consider the need of each
patient individually, to tailor the drug, route and mode of
administration to that patient's requirements, and then to
monitor on the basis of the response of the patient to the
treatment. [References: 27] </p>

<p> TI - Decision-making in the opioid therapy of cancer pain:
interim analysis of a prospective survey </p>

<p> (Meeting abstract) </p>

<p> AB - Sequential trials of opioid drugs or routes of
administration are frequently required to optimize the balance
between analgesia and adverse effects. Neither the clinical
factors that determine the choice of drug or route nor the
variability in patient (pt) response have been studied
previously. To assess these phenomena, we are evaluating pts
referred to the Pain Service using a new instrument completed by
the treating physician that records reason(s) for referral,
pain-related data, and reason(s) for change(s) in analgesic
regimen. To date, 25 consecutive pts with advanced cancer (11
males and 14 females; median age 51 yr, range 31-82) have been
followed until discharge (n=23) or death (n=2). The reason(s) for
referral included uncontrolled pain despite analgesic therapy
(68%), difficulties in pain assessment (33%), and analgesic
toxicity with inadequate (33%) or adequate (11%) analgesia. All
pts had received previous opioid trials (median 3, range 1-6).
Following referral, a total of 45 changes in either drug, route,
or both were evaluable. Two pts died and 13 were discharged
during the initial therapeutic trial. Ten required additional
trials to achieve an acceptable balance between pain relief and
adverse effects: 5 required 2 trials, 2 required 3 trials, and 3
required 4 or more sequential trials. The major factors that
influenced opioid selection were previously well tolerated (48%),
no known prior dose-limiting toxicity (51%), and easy to titrate
(56%). </p>

<p> Convenience of formulations (24%) was associated only with
the selection of morphine, whereas concerns regarding renal
function (8%) and drug metabolites (14%) were associated with the
selection of hydromorphone. The major reasons for the choice of a
parenteral rather than oral route were the need for very rapid
analgesic effect (66%), inability to swallow (31%), impaired
intestinal function (25%) and intolerance of po administered
drugs (18%). In the 2 cases in which spinal route was selected,
dose- limiting toxicity with systemic administration was the
compelling consideration. In 6 cases, an initial parenteral route
was changed to the oral route prior to discharge; the need for
rapid analgesic effect was a reason for the first selection, and
resolution of that need and improved convenience were the reasons
for the change. This interim analysis illustrates (1) the large
variability in response to different opioids and routes of
administration; (2) the potential utility of sequential
therapeutic trials; and (3) the likely existence of trends in the
rationale for the selection of opioid therapies, enhanced
understanding of which may improve therapeutic decision making AD

<p> controlled analgesia </p>

<p> AB - This preliminary study determined certified registered
nurse anesthetist (CRNA) practice experience and educational
needs in the preoperative evaluation of patients using
patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for chronic and cancer pain
management. A convenience sample (N = 29) of CRNAs practicing in
a university teaching hospital completed the surveys developed by
the investigator. Survey items related to CRNA experience with
management of patients using PCA preoperatively, PCA modes of
opioid delivery, and use of adjuvant medication for chronic and
cancer pain patients. Results of the study indicated that 79% of
CRNAs reported experience in administration of anesthesia to one
or more patients who used PCA preoperatively. However, only 32%
of CRNAs surveyed reported knowledge of the modes of opioid
delivery available. Results also indicated that 48% of CRNAs were
not familiar with adjuvant medications (ie, tricyclic
antidepressants, benzodiazepines, steroids, and anticonvulsants),
which are often prescribed in combination with opioids in chronic
pain management. The respondents reported use of a variety of
methods in handling opioid and infusion devices for patients
using PCA preoperatively. Fifty-two percent of CRNAs disconnected
the infusion and discarded the opioid preoperatively. Fourteen
percent reported leaving the PCA device connected to the patient
for use perioperatively or for continued pain management
postoperatively. Based upon the findings of this preliminary
study, CRNA education in management techniques for the use of PCA
infusions in chronic and cancer pain is recommended </p>

<p> TI - Flupirtine. A review of its pharmacological properties,
and therapeutic efficacy in pain states. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - Flupirtine is a novel non-opiate centrally acting
analgesic agent with muscle relaxant properties, advocated for
use in a number of pain states. Preliminary evidence suggests
that flupirtine 100 to 200mg orally or 150mg rectally 3 to 4
times daily (maximum daily dose 600mg) is more effective than
placebo in relieving moderate acute pain of various types. For
the relief of pain due to surgery, traumatic injury, dental
procedures, headache/migraine and abdominal spasms, flupirtine
has proved at least as effective as the opiate analgesics
codeine, dihydrocodeine and pentazocine, the nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory agents suprofen, diclofenac and ketoprofen, as
well as dipyrone and paracetamol (acetaminophen). Although
evidence to support a role in the treatment of chronic pain is
limited, flupirtine has been found as effective as pentazocine in
short term trials of patients with muscular or neuralgiform pain,
dysmenorrhoea, soft tissue rheumatism or cancer pain. The safety
profile of flupirtine has not yet been fully established,
although initial evidence suggests that adverse reactions, while
frequent, are usually minor in nature. The most common reactions
are drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth and various gastrointestinal
complaints. In comparison with opiate drugs, flupirtine appears
to produce fewer central nervous system effects, no respiratory
or cardiovascular depression, and no overt tolerance or physical
dependence on prolonged administration. If these initially
favourable results are confirmed in larger long term trials, then
flupirtine would appear to represent an effective analgesic for
the relief of moderate pain, particularly that of musculoskeletal

[Review] </p>

<p> AB - Primary care physicians are frequently required to treat
patients with chronic debilitating pain. Opioid analgesics can
successfully manage chronic pain. To prescribe opioid analgesics
effectively, physicians must identify appropriate patients.
Several methods can be used to identify and distinguish
appropriate patients, addicted patients, and for-profit drug
seekers. [References: 15] </p>

<p> AB - The principles of chronic pain management in the elderly
are the same as in younger people; whenever possible, the cause
of the pain should be identified and eradicated. However, older
people are more likely to suffer pain from incurable conditions,
and the emotional component of the suffering may be considerable.
Treatment options include analgesics, opiates, antidepressants
and anticonvulsants as well as psychological strategies, physical
strategies such as exercise and transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation (TENS), and surgery. Improvement of function may be a
more important treatment goal than relief of pain. </p>

English AB: Investigated the usefulness of a tricyclic
antidepressant in the management of chronic pain. 28 patients
(aged 38-79 yrs) undergoing surgery completed a randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial of 50 mg of
amitriptyline (AMT) po HS on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 while
using patient-controlled morphine or meperidine analgesia. Visual
analog and numerical verbal pain ratings, sedation scores, sleep
quantity/quality scores, and sense of well-being scores were
assessed twice daily on each of the days succeeding AMT/placebo
use. AMT was no different than placebo in altering the majority
of postoperative symptom variables studied in the sample study
population but caused no significant adverse effects. There does
not appear to be an opioid-sparing effect nor an improvement in
general well-being. Results of this study do not support general
use of AMT as a coanalgesic. (PsycLIT Database Copyright 1993

<p> TI - A single residue, aspartic acid 95, in the delta opioid
receptor specifies selective high affinity agonist binding </p>

<p> AB - The enkephalins, dynorphins, and endorphins are
endogenous opioids which function as neurotransmitters,
neuromodulators, and hormones and are involved in the perception
of pain, modulation of behavior, and regulation of autonomic and
neuroendocrine function. Pharmacological studies have defined
three classes of opioid receptors, designated as delta, kappa,
and mu. To investigate mechanisms by which agonists and
antagonists interact with the delta opioid receptor, we have
substituted aspartic acid 95 in the transmembrane segment 2 of
the cloned mouse delta opioid receptor with an asparagine (D95N).
The D95N mutant receptor had reduced affinity for delta
receptor-selective agonists such as enkephalin,
[D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin and [D-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 such
that it did not bind these peptides even at micromolar
concentrations. The binding of delta-selective non-peptide
agonists was also reduced. In contrast, the delta
receptor-selective antagonists, such as naltrindole, the
benzofuran analog of naltrindole, and 7-benyllidenenaltrexone,
bound equally well to the wild-type and mutant receptor.
Similarly, non- </p>

<p> selective opioid agonists such as bremazocine and
buprenorphine, which interact with delta, kappa, and mu </p>

<p> opioid receptors, showed no difference in binding to the
wild-type and mutant delta receptor. The D95N </p>

<p> mutant remained coupled to G proteins, and the receptor was
functionally active since it mediated agonist </p>

<p> inhibition of cAMP accumulation. These results indicate that
selective agonists and antagonists bind </p>

<p> differently to the delta receptor and show that Asp-95
contributes to high affinity delta-selective agonist </p>

<p> binding. The identification of a key residue involved in
selective agonist binding to the delta opioid receptor </p>

<p> will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic reagents
that can be used for the treatment of chronic </p>

<p> pain and other conditions. </p>

<p> TI - The effects of multidisciplinary pain management
treatment on locus of control and pain beliefs </p>

<p> in chronic non-terminal pain </p>

<p> AB - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether chronic pain patients'
beliefs and attributions about pain control </p>

<p> are amenable to change in a short-term inpatient
multidisciplinary pain management program. DESIGN: </p>

<p> Non-randomized consecutive sample with prospective,
before-after treatment. SETTING: Pain- </p>

<p> management, tertiary care center in a major U.S. city.
PATIENTS: All adult patients (n = 50) who were </p>

<p> treated in an inpatient multidisciplinary pain management
center were contrasted with those of a control </p>

<p> group of 46 adult patients who were treated in an outpatient
pain center. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain </p>

<p> Locus of Control Scale, the Pain Beliefs and Perceptions
Inventory, subjective pain intensity, and medication </p>

<p> usage were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS:
Statistically significant posttreatment changes </p>

<p> were found for the treatment group, but not the control
group. Patients who completed the inpatient pain </p>

<p> management program reported significant decreases in
subjective pain intensity despite discontinuation of </p>

<p> narcotic analgesics. Patients in the treatment group showed
an increased sense of personal control over their </p>

<p> pain and substantial decreases in attributions of pain
control to powerful others and chance. Patients in the </p>

<p> treatment group also showed a significant reduction in their
endorsement of the belief that their pain was a </p>

<p> mysterious phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic non-terminal pain
patients' beliefs about pain and </p>

<p> attributions of pain control are amenable to change in a
short-term inpatient multidisciplinary pain </p>

<p> management program. These results suggest that an intensive
multidisciplinary program involving </p>

<p> psychotherapy might be more effective in treating chronic
pain patients similar to those in this study than </p>

<p> outpatient treatment without psychotherapy. </p>

<p> AB - AB - PURPOSE: Pain is a common and feared symptom for
patients with incurable cancer. </p>

<p> Comprehensive assessment provides the foundation for
effective pain management, and data that clarify the </p>

<p> relationship between pain and other relevant factors also
facilitate this process. The main objective of the </p>

<p> study was to develop a clinical data base for advanced cancer
patients and to survey data to determine (1) </p>

<p> pain severity at admission, (2) opioid use at admission, (3)
change in opioid use during the hospital stay, and </p>

<p> (4) survival in the hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
Information was collected prospectively on </p>

<p> 1,103 patients admitted and on 1,017 patients who died within
6 months of the study's end. Demographic </p>

<p> and clinical data were recorded 72 hours after admission and
soon after death or discharge. RESULTS: </p>

<p> Seventy-three percent of patients had pain at admission.
Cancer of the cervix was frequently (68%) </p>

<p> associated with severe pain, as were prostate (52%) and
rectal/sigmoid tumors (49%). Severe pain was more </p>

<p> probable in those with bone metastasis, those admitted from
home, and in those younger than 55 years of </p>

<p> age. The majority (71.7%) of patients had a stable dosing
pattern, and only 4.2% of the patients required </p>

<p> dose increases of at least 10% per day. CONCLUSION: This
study demonstrated the wide variability in </p>

<p> opioid doses required. No reliable predictor of opioid
requirement was identified, and this lack of </p>

<p> predictability of cancer pain severity underscores the need
for ongoing assessment. AD - Calvary Hospital </p>

<p> TI - OPIOID RESPONSIVENESS OF NEUROPATHIC CANCER PAIN:
COMBINED ANALYSIS </p>

<p> OF SINGLE-DOSE ANALGESIC TRIALS (MEETING ABSTRACT) </p>

<p> AB - AB - Neuropathic pain resulting from damage to the
central or peripheral nervous system is common </p>

<p> in cancer patients (pts). Controversy exists about the opioid
responsiveness of this type of pain. Some </p>

<p> clinicians have suggested that these pains may be inherently
resistant to opioid analgesia; others have </p>

<p> postulated that the neuropathic mechanism may relatively
diminish the analgesic response. To assess these </p>

<p> hypotheses, we performed a combined analysis of the results
from 4 controlled single-dose analgesic trials </p>

<p> performed from 1978 to 1982, with morphine or heroin at high
and low doses. Analgesic response was </p>

<p> assessed serially over a 6-hr interval using a visual analog
scale and was summarized as a total pain relief </p>

<p> (TOTPAR) score. A total of 194 pts with chronic cancer pain
were included; there were 482 administrations </p>

<p> of study drug. Median age was 52 yr (20-79). Information
about characteristics of pts' pain recorded at the </p>

<p> time of study was reviewed independently by 2 experienced
pain clinicians who grouped each case according </p>

<p> to inferred pain mechanism (neuropathic, nociceptive or
mixed) and the degree of confidence in the inferred </p>

<p> mechanism (definite vs probable/possible). When initial
groupings differed, they were rereviewed with a </p>

<p> third investigator and disagreement was resolved by
consensus. Cases were grouped as follows: nociceptive </p>

<p> pain only (n=210), neuropathic pain only (n=51) and mixed
(n=221). Analgesic responsiveness was </p>

<p> evaluated comparing TOTPAR scores using the Student's t-test.
TOTPAR for the entire group was not </p>

<p> predicted by the specific drug (morphine vs heroin), but the
dose (high vs low) was a significant predictor of </p>

<p> TOTPAR. Placebo TOTPAR response was estimated at 5.1,
significantly less than the mean observed with </p>

<p> any group. The primary analysis for the study compared
analgesic response of pts having any neuropathic </p>

<p> component with those with only nociceptive pain. Results are
presented in a table. In a covariate analysis </p>

<p> that adjusted for prior opioid exposure and other prognostic
factors, the opioid responsiveness of </p>

<p> neuropathic pain was significant and was less than that of
purely nociceptive pain. These data support the </p>

<p> postulate that opioid responsiveness is a continuum and that
it is diminished by the neuropathic mechanism </p>

<p> AB - Opioids cause constipation by binding to specific opioid
receptors in the enteric and central nervous </p>

bioavailability of oral naloxone. This study was designed </p>

<p> to determine if oral naloxone could reverse opioid-induced
constipation without precipitating abstinence or </p>

<p> recrudescence of pain in opioid-dependent individuals.
Concentrations of unmetabolized and total naloxone, </p>

<p> including naloxone glucuronide, were measured by
radioimmunoassay. A dose-related increase in symptoms </p>

<p> of laxation resulted in all three opioid-dependent patients
studied that paralleled the increase in active and </p>

<p> total naloxone plasma levels. Withdrawal symptoms occurred
with plasma naloxone area under the plasma </p>

<p> concentration-time curves above 550 ng.min/ml and with dosing
intervals less than 3 hours. Peak plasma </p>

<p> levels did not predict withdrawal. Oral naloxone ameliorates
opioid-induced constipation in opioid- </p>

<p> dependent persons. Titration of dose to a maximum of 12 mg at
least 6 hours apart may be needed to avoid </p>

<p> TI - Renal autotransplantation in the loin pain-hematuria
syndrome: a cautionary note </p>

<p> AB - The current literature suggests that renal
autotransplantation is nearly uniformly effective in </p>

<p> controlling the severe and debilitating pain of the loin
pain-hematuria syndrome (LPHS). However, we </p>

<p> report two patients thought to have this syndrome in whom
renal autotransplantation did not result in long- </p>

<p> term control of pain. In case 1, autotransplantation resulted
in immediate cessation of pain; however, the </p>

<p> flank pain recurred 7 1/2 months later. The recurrent pain
was also severe and debilitating, requiring narcotic </p>

<p> medications for control. In case 2, autotransplantation of
the left kidney resulted in chronic pain in the left </p>

<p> pelvic area, the site of the autotransplanted kidney. In
addition, the patient continued to experience chronic </p>

<p> discomfort in the left flank and along the flank incision.
One year after autotransplantation, the patient still </p>

<p> requires multiple daily doses of narcotic medications for
pain control. Our two patients represent the 13th </p>

<p> and 14th reported patients subjected to renal
autotransplantation for management of LPHS. They represent </p>

<p> only the third and fourth reported patients with recurrence
of pain after renal autotransplantation. Because </p>

<p> studies with negative results are less likely to be reported
in the literature than studies with positive results, it </p>

<p> is possible that the literature overestimates the
effectiveness of renal autotransplantation in the LPHS. To </p>

<p> assess the true effectiveness of renal autotransplantation in
LPHS, a survey of patients with LPHS who have </p>

<p> undergone renal autotransplantation needs to be performed. </p>

opioids: report of five cases </p>

<p> AB - AB - Although it is widely appreciated that patients can
demonstrate highly variable responses to </p>

<p> different opioid drugs, there have been few detailed
descriptions of this phenomenon. To illustrate this </p>

<p> variability, we present 5 patients, 4 with cancer pain and 1
with non- malignant pain, who underwent dose </p>

<p> titration with more than 1 opioid and developed markedly
different responses to each. In every case, dose </p>

<p> escalation led to successful treatment with 1 opioid and to
intolerable side effects without adequate relief </p>

<p> with others. The existence of this individual variability in
the response to different opioids has important </p>

<p> implications for both clinical practice and current
understanding of opioid pharmacology in man. It </p>

<p> contradicts the view that any opioid is inherently more
efficacious than any other, suggests that patients who </p>

<p> fail to obtain adequate pain relief at maximally tolerated
doses of 1 opioid may benefit from an alternative </p>

<p> drug, and underscores the potential importance of genetic
factors as a determinant of opioid response. AD - </p>

when planning treatment for adolescents with </p>

<p> acute or chronic pain. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is
a method of administering opioids that </p>

<p> reinforces patient autonomy. Traditionally, opioids given by
PCA are administered via the intravenous or </p>

<p> subcutaneous route. Issues of autonomy and control, however,
are no less important for patients receiving </p>

<p> oral opioids. To augment patient autonomy, we have provided
oral medication kept at the bedside (oral </p>

<p> bedside PCA) for adolescents with diverse pain problems. We
describe our selection criteria and methods for </p>

<p> using oral bedside PCA with adolescents and present 4
patients who used this method. </p>

<p> TI - Opioid sensitivity of chronic pain: a patient-controlled
analgesia method </p>

<p> AB - Twenty-two patients with chronic pain of malignant or
nonmalignant origin were given intravenous </p>

<p> morphine by patient-controlled analgesia. A prestudy judgment
was made from the characteristics of the pain </p>

<p> as to whether it was nociceptive or neuropathic. Analgesic
efficacy was assessed by a nurse-observer; </p>

<p> adverse events were noted and plasma morphine and metabolitie
concentrations measured. Three categories </p>

<p> of opioid response were distinguished. Good responders
obtained &gt; 70 mm relief on the visual analogue </p>

<p> scale, with minimal or manageable adverse events. Moderate
responders obtained &lt; 70 but &gt; 30 mm relief </p>

<p> with more problematic adverse events, and poor responders had
&lt; 30 mm relief with troublesome adverse </p>

<p> events. This method for the study of opioid sensitivity
allowed a wide dosage range to be studied. The </p>

<p> simultaneous analgesic and adverse event measurements showed
that the spectrum of observed response was </p>

<p> wide, and response category could be judged for the majority
by 4 h. In those with poor or moderate </p>

<p> response, adverse event severity limited further dose
increment. The relationship between pain </p>

<p> characteristics and response showed that some pains judged to
be neuropathic had a good response to opioid </p>

<p> (5/13), and some pains judged to be nociceptive did not
(5/14). The study suggests that the pattern of </p>

<p> response is not as black and white as the prediction of good
response from nociceptive pain and poor from </p>

<p> neuropathic pain would suggest, although nociceptive pain was
more likely than neuropathic pain to show a </p>

<p> good response. For the moderate responders opioid titration
may, in the absence of other effective </p>

<p> treatments, be useful, but the analgesic endpoint may not be
totally satisfactory. The method provides an </p>

<p> operational definition of opioid sensitivity. </p>

<p> TI - Subcutaneous narcotic infusions for cancer pain:
treatment outcome and guidelines for use [see </p>

<p> comments] </p>

<p> AB - OBJECTIVE: To provide guidelines for the institution and
maintenance of a continuous subcutaneous </p>

<p> narcotic infusion program for cancer patients with chronic
pain through an analysis of the narcotic </p>

<p> requirements and treatment outcomes of patients who underwent
such therapy and a comparison of the costs </p>

<p> of two commonly used infusion systems. DESIGN: Retrospective
study. SETTING: Tertiary care facilities </p>

<p> and patients' homes. PATIENTS: Of 481 patients seen in
consultation for cancer pain between July 1987 </p>

<p> and April 1990, 60 (12%) met the eligibility criteria (i.e.,
standard medical management had failed, and they </p>

<p> had adequate supervision at home). INTERVENTION: Continuous
subcutaneous infusion with </p>

<p> hydromorphone hydrochloride or morphine started on an
inpatient basis and continued at home whenever </p>

<p> possible. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient selectivity, narcotic
dosing requirements, discharge rate, patient </p>

<p> preference for analgesic regimen, side effects, complications
and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The mean </p>

<p> initial maintenance infusion dose after dose titration was
almost three times higher than the dose required </p>

<p> before infusion (hydromorphone or equivalent 6.2 v. 2.1
mg/h). Eighteen patients died, and the remaining 42 </p>

<p> were discharged home for a mean of 94.4 (standard deviation
128.3) days (extremes 12 and 741 days). The </p>

<p> mean maximum infusion rate was 24.1 mg/h (extremes 0.5 and
180 mg/h). All but one of the patients </p>

<p> preferred the infusion system to their previous oral
analgesic regimen. Despite major dose escalations nausea </p>

<p> and vomiting were well controlled in all cases. Twelve
patients (20%) experienced serious systemic toxic </p>

<p> effects or complications; six became encephalopathic, which
necessitated dose reduction, five had a </p>

<p> subcutaneous infection necessitating antibiotic treatment,
and one had respiratory depression. The </p>

<p> programmable </p>

<p> computerized infusion pump was found to be more
cost-effective than the disposable infusion device after a </p>

<p> break-even point of 8 months. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous
subcutaneous infusion of opioid drugs with the </p>

<p> use of a portable programmable pump is safe and effective in
selected patients who have failed to respond to </p>

<p> standard medical treatment of their cancer pain. Dose
titration may require rapid dose escalation, but this is </p>

<p> usually well tolerated. For most communities embarking on
such a program a programmable infusion system </p>

<p> will be more cost-effective than a disposable system </p>

<p> TI - A review of the role of anti-opioid peptides in morphine
tolerance and dependence. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - Studies on the mechanisms of tolerance and dependence
have mostly focused on changes at the </p>

<p> receptor level. These experiments, conducted with model
systems ranging from clonal cell lines to whole </p>

<p> animals, have identified a number of important adaptive </p>

<p> mechanisms which occur at the receptor level. However, none
of these adaptive mechanisms can completely </p>

<p> account for the phenomena which serve to define the state of
morphine tolerance and dependence, especially </p>

<p> the observation that as an animal becomes more tolerant to
morphine, less naloxone is required to trigger </p>

<p> withdrawal. The data reviewed in this paper provide strong
support for the hypothesis that the brain </p>

<p> synthesizes and secretes neuropeptides which act as part of a
homeostatic system to attenuate the effects of </p>

<p> morphine and endogenous opioid peptides. According to this
model, administration of morphine releases </p>

<p> anti-opioid peptides (AOP), which then attenuate the effects
of morphine. As more morphine is given, more </p>

<p> AOP are released, thereby producing tolerance to the effects
of morphine. Cessation of morphine </p>

<p> administration, or administration of naloxone, produces a
relative excess of anti-opioid, which is in part </p>

<p> responsible for the withdrawal syndrome. Since endogenous and
exogenous antagonists might together </p>

<p> produce synergistic effects, less naloxone might be required
to trigger withdrawal in the presence of higher </p>

<p> levels of AOPs. Although the study of AOP is in its infancy,
a deeper understanding of the central nervous </p>

<p> system (CNS) anti-opioid systems may lead to new treatments
for chronic pain, substance abuse, and </p>

<p> psychiatric disorders. [References: 114] </p>

<p> TI - Chromaffin cell transplants for alleviation of chronic
pain </p>

<p> AB - Treatment of intractable pain with parenteral,
subarachnoid, or epidural narcotics is often </p>

<p> unsatisfactory due to tolerance and other systemic
complications that accompany increasing dosages of these </p>

<p> drugs. Other disadvantages include the potential infections
with implantable pumps and the inconvenience of </p>

<p> repeated narcotic administration. During the past several
years, studies at the author's laboratory indicated </p>

<p> that transplantation of adrenal medullary tissue or isolated
chromaffin cells into the spinal subarachnoid </p>

<p> space can significantly reduce pain in several rodent models
without resulting in development of tolerance. </p>

<p> Adrenal medullary chromaffin cells were selected because they
produce high levels of both opioid peptides </p>

<p> and catecholamines, agents that independently, and possibly
synergistically, reduce pain when injected locally </p>

<p> into the spinal subarachnoid space. The adrenal medullary
transplants survive for prolonged periods, and </p>

<p> continue to produce high levels of both catecholamines and
met-enkephalin. These transplants reduce pain in </p>

<p> two rodent chronic pain models, an arthritis model and a
peripheral neuropathy model, both of which closely </p>

<p> resemble human chronic pain syndromes. The success of the
animal studies has led to initiation of human </p>

<p> clinical trials in patients with chronic cancer pain; results
are promising. </p>

<p> TI - Patient-controlled analgesia: a review. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - The patient-activated analgesic system was introduced in
1968. Early trials, although uncontrolled, </p>

<p> supported the safety and efficacy of patient-controlled
analgesia (PCA) in several kinds of pain, such as that </p>

<p> relating to surgery, cancer, trauma, and obstetric
procedures. In the past decade, prospective, randomized </p>

<p> trials have reported several advantages of PCA over
conventional analgesia in the early postoperative period. </p>

<p> Although not supported by all controlled trials, they include
improved pain relief, less sedation, lower level </p>

<p> of narcotic consumption, fewer postoperative complications,
greater patient satisfaction, and improved </p>

<p> pulmonary function. Preliminary results in the management of
chronic pain indicate that PCA can lead to </p>

<p> significant lifestyle improvements in ambulatory patients
with cancer. The most significant, although </p>

<p> infrequent, adverse effect is respiratory depression, the
majority of cases occurring in patients predisposed </p>

<p> secondary to concomitant illness or as a result of human
error. The clinical use of PCA will likely see a </p>

<p> significant increase among persons with cancer, and an
increase in epidural administration. The cost benefit </p>

<p> of PCA has yet to be assessed in inpatient and outpatient
settings. [References: 114] </p>

been limited. We retrospectively reviewed our </p>

fentanyl. Adequate analgesia was achieved in all </p>

<p> patients. No intravascular or intrathecal injections were
noted, nor did any inadvertent epidural injections of </p>

revealed that medical students have limited personal </p>

<p> experience with pain and medications for pain, and limited
knowledge about pain. Pre-course attitudes </p>

<p> toward pain patients were dominated by perceived negative
characteristics of pain patients and the belief that </p>

<p> working with such patients is difficult. Attitudes measured 5
months after the course reflected increased </p>

<p> complexity, greater emphasis that pain is real and not
imaginary, and stronger belief that working with pain </p>

<p> patients is rewarding. Five months after the seminar,
students reported more accurate estimates of the </p>

<p> frequency of problems with addiction stemming from acute pain
treatment and exaggerated the prevalence of </p>

<p> pain problems in the society. The importance of integrating

<p> neuropathic pain or back pain. We used sustained-release
dihydrocodeine, buprenorphine, and sustained- </p>

analogue scales (VAS), and the Karnofsky </p>

<p> Performance Status Scale was used to assess the patient's
function. Good pain relief was obtained in 51 </p>

<p> patients and partial pain relief was reported by 28 patients.
Only 21 patients had no beneficial effect from </p>

<p> opioid therapy. There was a close correlation between the sum
and the peak VAS values (r = 0.983; p less </p>

<p> than 0.0001) and pain reduction was associated with an
increase in performance (p less than 0.0001). The </p>

<p> most common side effects were constipation and nausea. There
were no cases of respiratory </p>

<p> AB - Experimental studies have shown that opioids could
produce two types of effect on neuronal </p>

<p> excitability. The first one, aspecific, is a local anesthetic
action on the nerve fiber with a diminution of </p>

<p> sodium and potassium conductance. The second is specific: the
sodium conductance lowering is due to a </p>

<p> linkage of the opioid with a receptor on the internal face of
the membrane. Opioids could also migrate to the </p>

<p> posterior horn of the spinal cord after linkage with axonal
receptors. Clinical studies have proved that </p>

<p> opioid injection in peripheral nervous trunks and specially
in the brachial plexus produce a </p>

<p> prolonged analgesia status in the post operative period but
also and mostly in the chronic pain. The </p>

<p> more liposoluble opioids like fentanyl and buprenorphine are
the more effective. [References: 52] </p>

<p> AB - The aim of the regional administration of opioids is to
provide an efficient and prolonged analgesia. </p>

<p> Then, opiates can be useful for postoperative analgesia and
for the treatment of chronic pain of malignant </p>

<p> origin. Analgesia is correlated with several adverse effects
of which the most frequent are nausea and itching </p>

<p> and the most severe is respiratory depression. Beside the
adverse effects, other properties of opiates could </p>

<p> be responsible of favourable effects which can be taken in
advantage in specific indications. In the </p>

<p> postoperative period, epidurally administered opioid can
attenuate the neuroendocrine and metabolic </p>

<p> responses to surgery and pain. This effect is responsible of
a reduction of the resistance to insulin and of a </p>

<p> better nutritional balance, especially after major abdominal
surgical procedures. Opioids also act by a </p>

<p> reduction of the motor functions of the bowel, which perhaps
could reduce the incidence of anastomotic </p>

<p> breakdowns. Finally, other effects have been reported, as
anecdotes, such as the treatment of spasm after </p>

<p> bilateral replantation of the ureters, neurologic bladder
dysfunctions and enuresis. Spinal administration of </p>

<p> opioids has also been used as a treatment of premature
ejaculation. [References: 41] </p>

administered opioids and other drugs. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - Sharp pain is conducted rapidly by myelinated delta A
fibers and diffused pain slowly by </p>

<p> nonmyelinated C fibers to pseudobipolar neurons in the
posterior ganglion and </p>

<p> from there to neurons located in the posterolateral horn of
the spinal cord. From here on nociferous impulses </p>

<p> are transmitted by excitatory peptides (e.g. substance P) or
amino acids (e.g. glutamate, aspartate) through </p>

<p> interconnecting neurons of the pain pathways, primarily on
the contralateral side, to the brain stem and from </p>

<p> there to the sensory cortex, where they are appreciated and
acted upon. There are specific inhibitory </p>

<p> receptors located on axon terminals, near to the release
sites of the excitatory amino acids and peptides. </p>

<p> Stimulation of these receptors by their appropriate ligands
such as endogenous (e.g. enkephalis, endorphins) </p>

<p> or exogenous opioids, clonidine, serotonin, somatostatin
inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters </p>

<p> and relieves pain. There are at least 3 different opioid
receptors, called mu-, kappa- and delta-receptors in </p>

<p> the spinal cord. These can be differentiated from one another
by their specific affinity toward different </p>

<p> endogenous or exogenous opioids and the pure narcotic
antagonist, naloxone. It appears that the nociferous </p>

<p> impulses transmitted by parallel pathways equipped with
different inhibitory receptors have to be integrated </p>

<p> to produce pain sensation and partial inhibition of
transmission in different pathways or complete inhibition </p>

<p> in one of the pathways may relieve pain. In recent years the
concept of &quot;selective spinal analgesia&quot; has been </p>

<p> applied clinically for the relief of postoperative,
obstetrical and chronic pain. At first it was expected that the </p>

<p> intrathecal or peridural administration of morphine will
produce analgesia without the side effects of </p>

<p> systemically administered morphine. It soon became evident,
however, that intrathecally and peridurally </p>

<p> administered morphine after several hours of delay reaches
the fourth ventricle and by stimulating mu- </p>

<p> receptors may cause respiratory depression and other
undesired effects (e.g. nausea, vomiting, pruritus). </p>

<p> Several different approaches are being investigated for the
production of selective spinal analgesia without </p>

<p> side effects. They include: a. the use of more lipophilic,
long-lasting opioids (e.g. lofentanil) which would be </p>

<p> almost completely absorbed by the spinal cord and therefore
would not reach the medullary centers; b. the </p>

<p> development of opioids with specific affinity to kappa- and
for delta- and little or no affinity to mu- </p>

<p> receptors, primarily responsible for side effects; and c.
combining lower doses of opioid agonists with alpha </p>

<p> 2-adrenergic agonists (e.g. clonidine) or with somatostatin.
It is conceivable that in the not-too-distant </p>

<p> future, it will be possible to achieve through these
measures, selective spinal analgesia without side effects. </p>

<p> TI - Sufentanil citrate and morphine/bupivacaine as
alternative agents in chronic epidural infusions </p>

<p> for intractable non-cancer pain </p>

<p> AB - Intraspinal narcotic (usually intrathecal morphine)
infusions with implanted pumps are increasingly </p>

<p> used in patients with intractable chronic pain not caused by
cancer. In some patients, pain control is difficult </p>

<p> with infusions of morphine. Seven patients with diagnoses of
arachnoiditis, epidural scarring, and/or </p>

<p> vertebral body compression fracture were treated with
alternative solutions in an epidural route. For </p>

<p> maximal flexibility, Medtronic implanted programmable
infusion pumps with catheters to T6-T10 were used, </p>

<p> and pain was monitored by verbal pain scales. In three
patients, epidural infusions of morphine in 0.5% </p>

<p> bupivacaine (MS-MARC) resulted in little or no pain relief
without significant side effects (e.g., headache, </p>

<p> nausea, or vomiting). In these same patients, epidural
infusions of sufentanil citrate resulted in pain scale </p>

<p> reductions of 92%, 82%, and 40%, respectively, with no side
effects. Four other patients found more </p>

<p> effective pain relief when switched from initial sufentanil
citrate infusions to MS-MARC. Pain scale </p>

<p> reductions (with no side effects) were 92%, 76%, 59%, and 47%
in these patients. Pain relief and minimal </p>

<p> side effects with sufentanil citrate is theorized to result
from its higher lipophilicity promoting local </p>

<p> transdural diffusion to spinal cord and limiting upward
diffusion to the brain stem. Sufentanil citrate is also </p>

<p> advantageous for programmable pumps because it is 100 times
more potent than morphine and therefore </p>

<p> allows longer pump refill times and higher infusion doses.
Although this study was done on a limited number </p>

<p> of patients, sufentanil citrate and MS-MARC in epidural
infusions using programmable infusion pumps for </p>

<p> non-cancer patients provide significant alternative drug
combinations and routes. </p>

<p> CANCER PAIN (MEETING ABSTRACT) </p>

<p> AB - AB - The Medical College of Wisconsin multispecialty
cancer pain service reviewed its experiences </p>

<p> with epidural analgesia by retrospectively reviewing
hospital/clinic charts from January 1987 through </p>

<p> December 1989. 1205 patients (pts) were admitted to the
inpatient oncology service during the study period, </p>

<p> and epidural analgesia was used 16 times (15 pts, 1.2%).
Indications for epidural analgesia included failure </p>

<p> of systemic opioids and other noninvasive drug and nondrug
therapies per WHO guidelines. The mean pre- </p>

<p> epidural equianalgesic dose of im morphine was 300 mg/day.
Temporary catheters were used to assess </p>

<p> response to epidural morphine; if no response bupivacaine was
added; if no response the catheter was </p>

<p> removed; if analgesia was obtained the temporary catheter was
replaced by a tunneled catheter for long-term </p>

<p> use. Analgesia was successfully obtained in 12/16 epidural
attempts; 6 with morphine alone, 6 with morphine </p>

<p> plus bupivacaine. 4/16 attempts were discontinued due to
unacceptable toxicity or technical problems. </p>

<p> Tunneled catheters were used for a mean of 83 days (range
6-965 days). Catheter problems included </p>

<p> malfunction (7), infection (4), injection pain (4), epidural
hematoma (1), hyperesthesia (1). Epidural </p>

<p> TI - Opioid agonist-antagonist drugs in acute and chronic
pain states. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - The agonist-antagonist opioid analgesics are a
heterogeneous group of drugs with moderate to strong </p>

<p> analgesic activity comparable to that of the pure agonist
opioids such as codeine and morphine but with a </p>

<p> limited effective dose range. The group includes drugs which
act as an agonist or partial agonist at one </p>

<p> receptor and an antagonist at another (pentazocine,
butorphanol, nalbuphine, dezocine) and drugs acting as a </p>

<p> partial agonist at a single receptor (buprenorphine). These
drugs can be classified as nalorphine-like or </p>

<p> morphine-like. Meptazinol does not fit into either
classification and occupies a separate category. </p>

<p> Pentazocine, butorphanol and nalbuphine are weak
mu-antagonists and kappa-partial-agonists. All three </p>

<p> drugs are strong analgesics when given by injection:
pentazocine is one-sixth to one-third as potent as </p>

<p> morphine, nalbuphine is slightly less potent than morphine,
and butorphanol is 3.5 to 7 times as potent. The </p>

<p> duration of analgesia is similar to that of morphine (3 to 4
hours). Oral pentazocine is closer in analgesic </p>

<p> efficacy to aspirin and paracetamol (acetaminophen) than the
weak opioid analgesics such as codeine. </p>

<p> Neither nalbuphine nor butorphanol is available as an oral </p>

<p> formulation. At usual therapeutic doses nalbuphine and
butorphanol have respiratory depressant effects </p>

<p> equivalent to that of morphine (though the duration of such
effects with butorphanol may be longer). Unlike </p>

<p> morphine there appears to be a ceiling to both the
respiratory depression and the analgesic action. All of </p>

<p> these 3 drugs have a lower abuse potential than the pure
agonist opioid analgesics such as morphine. </p>

<p> However, all have been subject to abuse and misuse, and
pentazocine (but not the others) is subject to </p>

<p> Controlled Drug restrictions. Buprenorphine is a potent
partial agonist at the mu-receptor, and by </p>

<p> intramuscular injection is 30 times as potent as morphine. A
ceiling to the analgesic effect of buprenorphine </p>

<p> has been demonstrated in animals and it is also claimed in
humans. However, there are no reliable data </p>

<p> available to define the maximal dose of buprenorphine in
humans. A practical ceiling exists for sublingual use </p>

<p> in that the only available formulation is a 2 micrograms
tablet and few patients will accept more than 3 or 4 </p>

<p> of these in a single dose. The duration of analgesia is
longer than that of morphine, at 6 to 9 hours. There </p>

<p> have been suggestions that buprenorphine causes less
respiratory depression than morphine, but viewed </p>

<p> overall it appears that in equianalgesic doses the 2 drugs
have similar respiratory depressant </p>

<p> effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 118] </p>

<p> AB - OBJECTIVE: To review the legal provisions which control
the prescription of opioid analgesics in </p>

<p> Australia, and to summarise the areas in which practitioners
who treat patients with chronic pain may expect </p>

<p> to become involved with the legal system. DATA SOURCES: The
relevant legislation was reviewed, and a </p>

<p> selective review was undertaken of literature dealing with
the legal aspects of pain and suffering which may </p>

<p> form a basis for personal injury claims. Case law which deals
with issues of consent to treatment was also </p>

<p> examined. DATA SYNTHESIS: Statutory requirements which
control the prescription of opioids were </p>

<p> summarised. Leading cases on patient consent were discussed
to clarify for the practitioner the principles </p>

<p> which the Courts use in the assessment of the validity of the
consent given by patients for treatment. The </p>

<p> assessment of the pain patient involved in litigation was
briefly discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The </p>

<p> prescription and administration of opioid analgesics must be
in accordance with the legislative provisions. </p>

<p> Treatment options must be discussed and explained to patients
so that valid consent can be obtained. </p>

<p> TI - Epidural analgesia: a viable option for pain control </p>

<p> AB - Epidural analgesia is an important intervention for both
acute and chronic pain management. It has </p>

<p> been in use since the early 1900s, but the technique using
local application of opiate analgesics has only been </p>

<p> in use since the late 1970s (Moulin &amp; Coyle, 1986).
Today, many patients receive epidural analgesia for </p>

<p> postoperative pain control, and its use for acute or chronic
pain management in a hospital, pain clinic, or </p>

<p> home setting also continues to increase. Epidural analgesia
is also being utilized to manage acute pain in the </p>

<p> pediatric client. Epidural analgesia requires meticulous
techniques, beginning with placement of the epidural </p>

<p> catheter and continuing with administration of medications
and nursing management of the catheter. Nursing </p>

<p> assessment and development of protocols along with
preoperative and postoperative patient and family </p>

<p> teaching are vital components of the total plan of care. The
nurse practitioner (NP) or other health care </p>

<p> provider must be cognizant of safety considerations, whether
in the hospital environment, pain clinic, or </p>

<p> home setting. </p>

<p> TI - Nonnarcotic analgesics and tricyclic antidepressants for
the treatment of chronic nonmalignant </p>

<p> pain </p>

<p> AB - Chronic nonmalignant pain is often characterized by
multiple treatment failures, a pattern of </p>

<p> maladaptive behavior, and depression. Often there is a
history of inappropriate and excessive use of </p>

<p> medications for pain. Prior and ongoing use of narcotics and
sedatives acts to compound and aggravate the </p>

<p> chronic pain syndrome. A first step in treatment is
controlled withdrawal of these agents. Nonnarcotic </p>

<p> analgesics, NSAIDs, and tricyclic antidepressants are
commonly employed in patients with chronic pain. </p>

<p> Effective use of these agents requires understanding of their
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic </p>

<p> properties. Use of a fixed-time schedule is necessary to
achieve an effective, sustained therapeutic response. </p>

<p> Careful patient education and monitoring for side effects and
toxicity are necessary, particularly in the </p>

<p> elderly and patients with coexisting medical disorders.
Incidence of side effects and toxicity may be reduced </p>

<p> by choice of drug and modification of dosing regimen.
Nonnarcotic analgesics, TCAs, and NSAIDs are </p>

<p> seldom effective by themselves in resolving the pain and
distress of patients with chronic nonmalignant pain. </p>

<p> This is particularly true when maladaptive behavior coexists.
A comprehensive multimodal pain management </p>

<p> program encompassing additional pain-relieving strategies and
behavior-modifying techniques should be </p>

<p> considered and utilized in conjunction with medication. </p>

<p> TI - Treatment principles for the use of opioids in pain of
nonmalignant origin. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - Inadequately treated acute and chronic pain remains a
major cause of suffering, in spite of enormous </p>

<p> advances in pharmacology and technology. Opioids provide a
powerful, versatile, widely available means of </p>

<p> managing this pain, but their use is too often restrained by
ignorance and mistaken fears of addiction. The </p>

<p> management of postoperative pain (perhaps the most common
form of acute pain) is traditionally attempted </p>

<p> with fixed dosages of analgesics by relatively unpredictable
routes (e.g. oral, rectal and intramuscular). </p>

<p> Intravenous opioid infusions (an improvement) risk
respiratory depression and require close monitoring and </p>

<p> titration. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), by contrast,
permits the most efficacious medication (pure </p>

<p> opioid agonist) by the optimal route (intravenous) under
direct control of the patient, and provides high </p>

<p> levels of satisfaction and safety. Ideally, any opioid use
should be integrated with a wide spectrum of other </p>

<p> analgesic modalities in an anaesthesiology-based 'acute pain
service'. The use of opioids for chronic pain of </p>

<p> nonmalignant origin remains controversial. There is a
perceived conflict between patients' interests and those </p>

<p> of society. However, problems (such as tolerance, physical
dependence, addiction and chronic toxicity), </p>

<p> anticipated from experience with animal experiments and
pain-free abusers, seldom cause difficulties when </p>

<p> opioids are used appropriately to treat pain (so-called 'dual
pharmacology'). With sensible guidelines, and in </p>

<p> the context of a multidisciplinary pain clinic, opioids may
provide the only hope of relief to many sufferers of </p>

<p> chronic pain. [References: 88] </p>

PRESCRIBING </p>

<p> PRACTICE (MEETING ABSTRACT) </p>

<p> AB - AB - 200 Wisconsin Mds chosen at random were mailed a
survey in June 1990 to assess </p>

<p> knowledge/attitudes concerning regulatory law. 90 surveys
(45%) were evaluable for review, including </p>

<p> internists (27), surgeons (25), family practitioners (19),
other (19). MDs had poor knowledge of drug </p>

<p> schedule and number of allowable refills of seven different
opioids. 32% of MDs did not know that an </p>

<p> emergency supply of a schedule II drug could be prescribed by
telephone. MDs were very concerned about </p>

<p> possible investigation when using opioids: 15, 17 and 19
times more concerned about prescribing morphine, </p>

<p> hydromorphone and methadone, respectively, than when
prescribing codeine with acetaminophen. MDs </p>

<p> were 8 times more concerned about possible investigation when
using opioids to treat chronic cancer pain </p>

<p> than when using opioids for acute pain and 20 times more
concerned if the patient had a history of drug </p>

<p> abuse, even with a 'real' reason to have pain. MDs were less
concerned about investigation than about </p>

<p> addiction, tolerance or respiratory depression. Wisconsin MDs
have serious concerns about using opioid </p>

<p> analgesics and poor knowledge of regulatory laws. Education
is needed to lessen these fears, especially as </p>

<p> they apply to the treatment of cancer-related pain AD -

<p> AB - The new SKY epidural catheter was evaluated, based upon
information collected about implant and </p>

<p> use of 53 catheters by 51 patients. Catheters were used to
treat chronic pain of a malignant (n = 25) and </p>

<p> nonmalignant (n = 28) origin. Of 3450 treatment days, 89%
occurred at home. Mean catheter use for </p>

<p> malignant and nonmalignant conditions were 58.6 and 76.3
days/patient, respectively. Visual analogue pain </p>

<p> scores in the first wk after implant indicated 79% of
patients achieved good to excellent pain relief. Clinical </p>

<p> impressions indicated this group achieved substantial
long-term pain relief. No serious complications were </p>

<p> observed. Two types of leakage required removing 5 catheters,
prompting changes that eliminated </p>

<p> subsequent leakages of both types. Accidental patient
retraction and subcutaneous infection each required a </p>

<p> catheter removal. No subarachnoid or epidural infections
occurred. The SKY catheter proved to be safe and </p>

<p> reliable. Therapy was cost-effective, since patients achieved
substantial pain relief while treated at home </p>

physiology of rectal drug absorption and such data as </p>

<p> exists on the different opioids that have been administered

<p> suppositories have a place in the management of chronic pain
but the variability in dissolution and drug </p>

patients experienced very good pain relief. Only two </p>

<p> patients needed further narcotic analgesics. Eight patients
stopped using the stimulation system. To ensure </p>

<p> TI - Pain management with spinally administered opioids.
[Review] </p>

<p> AB - The use of spinally administered opioids to manage pain
is discussed. Central action on opioid </p>

<p> receptors of the substantia gelatinosa allows opioids to be
administered spinally for pain originating </p>

<p> anywhere inferior to the cranial nerves. Spinal opioids are
most commonly administered for intractable </p>

<p> midline sacral and perineal pain. The best candidates for
spinal opioids are patients in whom appropriate </p>

<p> &quot;conventional&quot; therapy no longer provides adequate
relief, patients who experience severe adverse effects </p>

<p> from conventional therapy, and patients for whom alternative
anesthetic procedures are inappropriate or </p>

<p> have failed. A reasonably safe initial dose is morphine
sulfate 1 mg intrathecally. The availability of </p>

<p> preservative-free, concentrated morphine sulfate enables
larger doses to be safely and comfortably </p>

<p> administered. Increased dosage requirements may result from
tolerance, progression of disease, increased </p>

<p> systemic absorption, or slippage of the catheter tip. As with
systemically administered opioids, care must be </p>

<p> exercised when discontinuing spinal opioid therapy. Adjuvant
drugs used with spinal opioids include </p>

<p> systemically administered analgesics, antidepressants,
corticosteroids, and spinal local anesthetics. The </p>

<p> administration of spinal opioids with systemic opioids or
other CNS depressants may result in excessive </p>

<p> sedation, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting,
constipation, pruritus, and other adverse effects. Spinally </p>

<p> administered opioids can be used to manage severe chronic
pain effectively, safely, and comfortably. </p>

prescriptions for narcotics were obtained from </p>

<p> pharmacies by 4131 persons living in a town of 250,000
inhabitants in the Federal Republic of Germany. </p>

<p> 2412 patients (58.4%) had been prescribed narcotics on only
one occasion, 3178 patients (76.9%) over a </p>

<p> limited period of six months, presumably for acute pain. Only
520 patients (12.6%) received, over a period </p>

<p> of at least six months, five or more narcotic prescriptions
per six months. Reasons for the latter prescriptions </p>

<p> were malignant tumours in 273 (6.6%) and chronic pain due to
benign diseases in 144 (3.5%). In 21 patients </p>

<p> (0.5%) the narcotic dosage had risen over two years,
presumably because of the development of tolerance. </p>

<p> 19 patients had been on narcotics for at least eight years,
without their doctor diagnosing addiction. The </p>

<p> AB - In the past, pain control for chronic pain syndromes
using narcotic infusion has been carried out </p>

<p> primarily via the intrathecal (subarachnoid) route. This
report presents one of the first large series of </p>

<p> terminally ill cancer patients with intractable pain treated
with continuous epidural morphine infusions by </p>

<p> means of implanted pumps and epidural spinal catheters. The
purpose of the study was to demonstrate that </p>

<p> the epidural route is effective with minimal complications,
and that screening with temporary epidural </p>

<p> catheter infusions results in a high rate of subsequent pain
relief. A multidisciplinary team (neurosurgeon, </p>

<p> anesthesiologists, psychiatrists, oncologists, and nurse
clinicians) evaluated and treated all of the patients </p>

<p> studied. Percutaneous placement of temporary epidural
catheters for a trial assessment was performed by the </p>

<p> anesthesiologists. Pain evaluations were conducted
independently by psychiatrists using both verbal and </p>

<p> visual analog scales. From 1982 to 1988, 41 (59.4%) of 69
patients evaluated for eligibility experienced </p>

<p> good pain control during trial assessment and were
subsequently implanted with Infusaid infusion pumps. </p>

<p> Preinfusion pain analog values were 8.6 +/- 0.3 and
postimplantation values at 1 month were 3.8 +/- 0.4 (p </p>

<p> less than 0.001). Over this same 1-month period. requirements
of systemic morphine equivalents decreased </p>

<p> by 79.3% with epidural infusions as compared to preinfusion
requirements (p less than 0.001). There were </p>

<p> no instances of epidural scarring, respiratory depression,
epidural infections, meningitis, or catheter </p>

<p> blockage. One patient developed apparent drug tolerance and
three patients required further catheter </p>

<p> manipulations. This series strongly suggests that significant
reductions in cancer pain can be obtained with </p>

<p> few complications and a low morphine tolerance rate using
chronic epidural morphine infusion. </p>

<p> AB - The pathogenesis of cancer pain, the incidence of pain
associated with specific types of malignant </p>

discussed, and alternative delivery systems for pain </p>

<p> management are described. More than 80% of cancer patients
with advanced metastatic disease suffer </p>

<p> moderate to severe pain. Most cancer pain is caused by direct
tumor infiltration; approximately 20% of </p>

<p> cancer pain may be attributed to the effects of surgery,
radio-therapy, or chemotherapy. The incidence of </p>

<p> cancer pain is related to tumor type; 70% or more of patients
with tumors of the bone, cervix, and ovaries </p>

<p> suffer cancer-related pain, while only 5% of patients with
leukemia have pain. Pain is defined by the organs </p>

<p> involved. Somatic pain is usually dull and well localized;
visceral pain is generalized and difficult to describe. </p>

<p> Other types of pain, including deafferentation pain and
referred pain, are particularly difficult to manage. </p>

<p> Cancer pain may be acute or chronic. The latter may cause
psychological reactions that make effective </p>

<p> treatment more challenging. Opiate analgesic agents,
administered by the epidural or intrathecal routes, </p>

<p> block pain more selectively and produce fewer adverse
reactions than systemic analgesic agents. The </p>

<p> duration and onset of analgesia depend on the lipophilicity
of the agent used. Because pain is the most </p>

<p> common complaint of the patient with cancer, clinicians
should be aware of the range of pharmacologic and </p>

<p> nonpharmacologic analgesic modalities available to them.
Familiarity with newer modalities and delivery </p>

<p> routes, such as spinal administration of opiate analgesics,
is recommended. [References: 6] </p>

Others are antagonist, i.e., they bind to the receptor </p>

<p> but do not cause the associated effects. Some drugs, termed
agonist-antagonist opioids, act as antagonists at </p>

<p> one type of receptor and agonists at another type of
receptor. True agonists tend to have relatively straight- </p>

<p> line dose-response curves; in other words, their effect
increases with increasing doses over a broad dosage </p>

<p> range. Partial agonists and agonist-antagonists tend to have
ceiling effects; that is, they do not have the </p>

<p> broad dosage range of drugs such as morphine, methadone,
hydromorphone, and other &quot;strong&quot; opioids. </p>

<p> This fact mediates against the use of partial agonists and
agonist-antagonists in cancer patients who have </p>

<p> chronic pain that may increase as the disease progresses.
Three major factors that should be considered </p>

<p> when a drug is selected for clinical use are (1) relative
affinities for the different opioid receptor types, (2) </p>

<p> pharmacokinetic characteristics that influence onset and
duration of action, and (3) whether the opioids are </p>

<p> strong or weak. For treatment of cancer pain, drugs with long
durations of action are </p>

<p> preferable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) [References: 11]

<p> TI - Chronic TM disorder and non-TM disorder pain: a
comparison of behavioral and psychological </p>

<p> characteristics </p>

<p> AB - The purpose of this paper is to determine whether
patients with chronic temporomandibular disorder </p>

<p> (TMD) pain manifest behavioral, experimental, and
psychological characteristics similar to patients with </p>

<p> other chronic pain illnesses. The Chronic Pain Battery (CPB),
a multidimensional assessment tool for chronic </p>

<p> pain patients, was used to compare several important
variables between 78 TM disorder (TMD) patients and </p>

<p> 98 non-TMD chronic pain patients. The study found that
chronic TMD patients had lower &quot;usual&quot; pain </p>

<p> intensity and suffering levels, fewer vegetative symptoms
associated with depression, higher pain tolerance, </p>

<p> less impairment of activity, more hope about treatment
outcome, lower health care system utilization, but </p>

<p> higher reported stress levels than non-TMD chronic pain
patients. The two groups manifested no significant </p>

<p> differences in use of narcotics, sedatives, and sleeping
pills; levels of depression, anxiety, somatization, </p>

<p> hostility, or psychoticism; illness behavior reinforcement in
their social surroundings; or ratings of problems </p>

<p> with work, family, self-esteem, or suicidal impulses. These
findings suggest that chronic TMD pain patients </p>

<p> (with a symptom duration of over six months) are behaviorally
and psychologically similar to non-TMD </p>

<p> chronic pain patients, but that they differ in their
perceptions of their disorder, rendering them less </p>

<p> handicapped by their problems. Psychological, social, and
behavioral treatment methods useful for treating </p>

<p> chronic pain syndrome may thus also be applied along with
dental therapy for optimal treatment of TMD </p>

<p> TI - [The multidisciplinary outpatient pain clinic in
relation to anesthesia. An important task for the </p>

<p> anesthesiologist]. [Review] [German] </p>

<p> AB - Anesthesiologists have always played a leading role in
research into pain and its treatment. Their </p>

<p> efforts, however, have been focused on acute or postoperative
pain problems. It was the American </p>

<p> anesthesiologist John J. Bonica who fought for an increased
interest in chronic pain. The establishment of </p>

<p> the first Multidisciplinary Pain Center at the University of
Washington in Seattle, the foundation of the </p>

<p> International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and
Melzack and Wall's now 25 year old gate control </p>

<p> theory were the driving forces behind rapid developments in
research and treatment in the area of chronic </p>

<p> pain. The realization that chronic pain was the most frequent
cause of disability in the United States also </p>

<p> gave an impetus for new efforts in treatment. The classic
anesthesiological topics, such as operative </p>

<p> anesthesia emergency medicine and intensive care, have been
extended to include acute pain services and </p>

<p> chronic pain treatment facilities. This reflects the
understanding that anesthesiological knowledge and </p>

<p> techniques can be valuable to patients in severe acute pain
and those in lingering long-term chronic pain </p>

<p> phases. Anesthesiologists are skilled in the use of opioid
narcotics and in the administration of strong </p>

<p> analgesics. Many severe pain problems can be solved by
correct use of the analgesic regimen. Special ways </p>

<p> of administering narcotic analgesics, such as epidural
infusion or patient-controlled analgesia, have already </p>

<p> alleviated the pain problems of many patients.
Anesthesiological techniques are also crucial in diagnosis. </p>

<p> Sequential differential blockade and simple nerve blocks can
be helpful in the diagnosis and classification of </p>

<p> the pain problems. Anesthesiological contributions to a
chronic pain service are not restricted to medical </p>

<p> interventions. Organizational skills are also needed for
efficient running of multidisciplinary pain treatment </p>

<p> facilities. Clinical practice in surgical anesthesia means
that anesthesiologists are experienced in </p>

<p> interdisciplinary work and familiar with the advantages and
dangers of team work. Despite international </p>

<p> acceptance of the multidisciplinary approach to chronic pain,
there is still a lack of appropriate facilities in </p>

<p> the German-speaking countries, and we consider it important
that anesthesiologists commit themselves to </p>

<p> increasing general awareness of what is needed. [References:

advantages and disadvantages of tramal as an </p>

<p> agent used for the relief of acute and chronic pain syndrome.
In 18 patients tramal was used in postoperative </p>

<p> the postoperative period tramal has no noticeable advantages
over promedol. However, tramal had definite </p>

<p> advantages over other opiate agonists when used for the
treatment of chronic pain syndrome in incurable </p>

<p> cancer patients. Thus, the data obtained show that tramal, a
synthetic analgesic of a new generation, has no </p>

characteristics [see comments] </p>

<p> AB - In the cancer population, the term breakthrough pain
typically refers to a transitory flare of pain in the </p>

<p> setting of chronic pain managed with opioid drugs. The
prevalence and characteristics of this phenomenon </p>

<p> have not been defined, and its impact on patient care is
unknown. We developed operational definitions for </p>

<p> breakthrough pain and its major characteristics, and applied
these in a prospective survey of patients with </p>

<p> cancer pain. Data were collected during a 3 month period from
consecutive patients who reported moderate </p>

<p> pain or less for more than 12 h daily and stable opioid
dosing for a minimum of 2 consecutive days. Of 63 </p>

<p> patients surveyed, 41 (64%) reported breakthrough pain,
transient flares of severe or excruciating pain. </p>

<p> Fifty-one different pains were described (median 4 pains/day;
range 1-3600). Pain characteristics were </p>

<p> extremely varied. Twenty-two (43%) pains were paroxysmal in
onset; the remainder were more gradual. The </p>

<p> duration varied from seconds to hours (median/range: 30
min/1-240 min), and 21 (41%) were both </p>

<p> paroxysmal and brief (lancinating pain). Fifteen (29%) of the
pains were related to the fixed opioid dose, </p>

<p> occurring solely at the end of the dosing interval.
Twenty-eight (55%) of the pains were precipitated; of </p>

<p> these, 22 were caused by an action of the patient (incident
pain), and 6 were associated with a non-volitional </p>

<p> precipitant, such as flatulence. The pathophysiology of the
pain was believed to be somatic in 17 (33%), </p>

<p> visceral in 10 (20%), neuropathic in 14 (27%), and mixed in
10 (20%). Pain was related to the tumor in 42 </p>

<p> (82%), the effects of therapy in 7 (14%), and neither in 2
(4%). Diverse interventions were employed to </p>

<p> manage these pains, with variable efficacy. These data
clarify the spectrum of breakthrough pains and </p>

<p> indicate their importance in cancer pain management </p>

<p> TI - Adrenal medullary implants in the rat spinal cord reduce
nociception in a chronic pain model </p>

<p> AB - Previous work in this laboratory has indicated that the
transplantation of adrenal medullary tissue into </p>

<p> the subarachnoid space of the rat spinal cord can reduce pain
sensitivity to acute noxious stimuli, particularly </p>

<p> following stimulation by nicotine. This most likely results
from the stimulated release of opioid peptides and </p>

<p> catecholamines from the transplanted chromaffin cells.
However, chronic pain models may more closely </p>

<p> resemble human clinical pain, and the arthritic rat model has
been used for screening potential therapeutic </p>

<p> strategies. The purpose of the present study was to assess
the potential for adrenal medullary tissue </p>

<p> implanted into the spinal subarachnoid space to alleviate
chronic pain. Adrenal medullary tissue was </p>

<p> implanted into adjuvant-induced arthritic rats, and changes
in body weight and vocalization responses were </p>

<p> monitored over the 10 week course of the disease. Results
indicate that the severe weight reduction </p>

<p> normally associated with this inflammatory arthritis was
attenuated by adrenal medullary, but not control, </p>

<p> implants. In addition, vocalizations were reduced in animals
implanted with adrenal medullary, but not </p>

<p> control tissue following nicotine stimulation. This reduction
was blocked by the opiate antagonist, naloxone, </p>

<p> and partially attenuated by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist,
phentolamine. Together, these results suggest </p>

<p> that the transplantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the
subarachnoid space of the spinal cord may </p>

<p> provide a local source of opioid peptides and catecholamines
for the reduction of chronic pain </p>

studies. It is postulated that this misplacement of </p>

<p> the catheter likely occurred as a result of recent lumbar
punctures the patient had undergone. Extravasation </p>

<p> of cerebrospinal fluid created a false space and contributed
to the misplacement and ultimate failure of the </p>

<p> AB - Although tricyclic antidepressants are especially useful
in the treatment of chronic pain conditions, </p>

<p> most of the work about its mechanism of action has been made
on acute pain tests. The present study was </p>

<p> aimed at studying the role played by noradrenergic and
opioidergic influences on the antinociceptive activity </p>

<p> of subchronically administered clomipramine in the formalin
test (a tonic pain model) in rats. Clomipramine </p>

<p> produced antinociception after 7 days, administration (2.5
mg/kg/day), an effect equivalent to that obtained </p>

<p> by acute morphine (5 mg/kg). The antinociceptive effect of
clomipramine was inhibited by the following: </p>

<p> nonspecific blocking of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors by
phentolamine, specific blocking of alpha 1- </p>

<p> adrenoceptors by prazosin; stimulation of alpha 2 receptors
by clonidine; and blocking of the opioid </p>

<p> receptors by naloxone. Blocking the alpha 2-receptors with
yohimbine did not antagonize the effect of </p>

<p> clomipramine. These results suggest that clomipramine
produces antinociception in this test, partly via the </p>

<p> participation of the endogenous opioid system and partly by
further activating or potentiating previously </p>

<p> activated noradrenergic pathways which are involved in the
control of pain information </p>

<p> TI - The assessment and treatment of pain in the emergency
room. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - A broad spectrum of painful conditions presents to the
modern emergency center (EC). The three </p>

<p> most common categories are acute, self-limited disorders;
chronic medical or surgical syndromes with acute </p>

<p> exacerbation; and psychic pain syndromes in which the
etiology cannot be easily ascertained. Many factors </p>

<p> may differentiate pain from suffering, and physicians should
educate patients not only about the nature of </p>

<p> their condition and its prognosis, but also about anticipated
discomfort. Clinical concerns in the EC include </p>

<p> physicians' tendency to undertreat or even ignore pain, the
need for appropriate but flexible dosage </p>

<p> schedules, and physicians' concern about masking important
signs and symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti- </p>

<p> inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are currently the safest and most
effective group of oral analgesics. Important </p>

<p> factors for drug selection include efficacy, dosage, lack of
side effects, and cost. Two special groups of </p>

<p> patients, those with psychic pain syndromes and those with
drug-seeking behavior, can create problems for </p>

<p> the physician. Patients with chronic pain syndromes need
special follow-up but do not benefit from </p>

<p> additional analgesic drug therapy. Patients who seek and
abuse drugs can be difficult to identify, may have </p>

<p> true underlying medical pathology, and should not be given
narcotic prescriptions. [References: 15] </p>

<p> was labeled by a specific tritiated inhibitor,

into one of four groups based on their response </p>

<p> to the epidural solutions: placebo response group--pain
relief with placebo solutions; fentanyl response </p>

<p> group--pain relief with epidural fentanyl; lidocaine response
group (LRG)--pain relief with lidocaine but not </p>

the solutions used. The four groups were </p>

<p> compared on the basis of age, sex, site of pain, duration of
pain, narcotic use, pain assessment index, and </p>

<p> workmen's compensation claims. The comparisons resulted in
the conclusion that LRG patients had a much </p>

basis of the information gathered, it was </p>

<p> theorized that, despite their response to epidural lidocaine,
LRG patients may actually be a group of operant </p>

<p> TI - Radioimmunoassay of buprenorphine in urine: studies in
patients and in a drug clinic </p>

<p> AB - A radioimmunoassay kit (DPC buprenorphine double
antibody) was evaluated with clinical samples </p>

<p> and samples from a drug clinic. Urine samples were collected
over a 2-day period from 5 hospital in-patients </p>

<p> receiving sublingual buprenorphine, 400 to 2000
micrograms/day, for the relief of chronic pain. Samples </p>

<p> were measured before and after enzymatic hydrolysis. Urine
buprenorphine concentrations were measurable </p>

<p> at all doses studied (minimum value 5.6 ng/mL) and were
greater with larger doses. The increase in </p>

<p> concentration after hydrolysis averaged 49% and was similar
for all doses studied. The authors conclude that </p>

<p> the method has extensive cross-reactivity with glucuronides
of buprenorphine and its metabolites and that </p>

<p> samples may be analyzed without prior hydrolysis. The
prevalence of buprenorphine use in 97 patients </p>

<p> attending a drug clinic was also studied. Sixty (62%) had
measurable urinary buprenorphine concentrations </p>

<p> of 1 ng/mL or more by direct assay. The buprenorphine users
were significantly younger and reported </p>

<p> significantly greater use of opiates than nonusers </p>

<p> TI - Comparison of subjective and objective analgesic effects
of intravenous and intrathecal </p>

<p> morphine in chronic pain patients by heat beam dolorimetry </p>

<p> AB - The pain tolerance latencies of 10 chronic pain patients
were evaluated by heat beam dolorimetry </p>

<p> (stimulus intensity 15.33 mW.cm-2.sec-1) prior to and
following administration of morphine by intrathecal </p>

<p> (n = 5) or intravenous (n = 5) routes. Patients not
undergoing opiate withdrawal evinced increased baseline </p>

<p> pain tolerance latencies prior to drug administration
compared with normal volunteers. Two patients </p>

<p> undergoing the opiate withdrawal syndrome at the time of test
experienced reduced pain tolerance latencies </p>

<p> compared with normal volunteers, most probably corresponding
to the hyperesthesia symptom of the </p>

<p> syndrome. Intravenous morphine infusion (30 mg) induced a
time-dependent increase in cutaneous pain </p>

<p> tolerance with peak effect occurring 1-2 h after
administration. This persisted for up to 4 h and thereafter </p>

<p> declined. The time course of subjective pain self-report by
visual pain analog scale (VPAS) measurements </p>

<p> corresponded to the time course of increasing cutaneous pain
tolerance latency assessed by dolorimetry. </p>

<p> Pain self-reports following intrathecal morphine infusion
(2.25 or 1 mg) followed a similar though slower </p>

<p> onset to that reported by patients receiving intravenous
morphine and was of lesser degree. In contrast, heat </p>

<p> beam dolorimetric evidence of increased cutaneous pain
tolerance (which was of lesser degree than </p>

<p> following i.v. morphine) did not reach its maximum during the
4 h measuring period. A dissociation was </p>

<p> noted therefore between the self-reported relief of
endogenous pain and dolorimetrically measured </p>

<p> cutaneous analgesia following intrathecal morphine
administration. Linear regression correlation analysis </p>

<p> characterized this phenomenon as a positive correlation
between cutaneous pain tolerance and pain relief </p>

<p> self-report following intravenous morphine infusion and a
negative correlation following intrathecal </p>

<p> administration. We propose that the phenomenon may be due to
intrathecal morphine acting via two </p>

<p> separate compartments: one spinal and one
supraspinal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </p>

<p> TI - Electrophysiological evidence for a tonic activity of
the spinal cord intrinsic opioid systems in a </p>

<p> chronic pain model </p>

<p> AB - The aim of this electrophysiological investigation was
to evaluate the activity of the spinal endogenous </p>

<p> opioid systems in a chronic pain model, the arthritic rat.
The activity of nociceptive non-specific dorsal horn </p>

<p> neurons (n = 23) were recorded in 23 spinal unanesthetized
decerebrated rats. Naloxone (1 mg/kg i.v.) </p>

<p> induced a highly significant increase in the spontaneous
firing rate of these neurons. This observation is in </p>

<p> favor of a tonic activity of spinal opioid endogenous systems
in such a disease. In addition, the same dose of </p>

<p> naloxone facilitates the transmission of noxious messages at
the spinal level as revealed by the large </p>

<p> enhancement of the responses of these neurons to C-fiber
stimulation. These results are in good agreement </p>

<p> with behavioral data showing that such a relatively high dose
of naloxone induced well-reproducible </p>

<p> hyperalgesia and with some biochemical observations showing
an increase of levels and biosynthesis of </p>

<p> endogenous opioids in the spinal cord of the arthritic rat </p>

patient. Epidural bupivacaine infusions have </p>

<p> been reported to be safe and effective for pain control in

evaluate the effect of continuous epidural </p>

<p> bupivacaine on postoperative pain and progressive knee ROM as
well as to record the incidence of urinary </p>

<p> retention and other side effects or complications. Continuous
epidural bupivacaine infusion was found to </p>

<p> provide safe, effective analgesia for TKA patients in the
immediate postoperative period. Excellent pain </p>

<p> relief with reduced narcotic requirements was observed in the
patients as compared to intramuscular narcotic </p>

<p> analgesia. No complications occurred and serum bupivacaine
levels remained well below toxic levels. Short </p>

<p> [Review] [German] </p>

<p> AB - The relief of chronic pain, which had lost its warning
function and had become a disease entity, is one </p>

<p> of the main scopes of the so-called &quot;functional
neurosurgery&quot;. If it is impossible to eliminate the origin
of </p>

<p> chronic pain condition, or if conservative treatment is not
effective, this is an indication for a surgical </p>

<p> intervention. &quot;Destructive methods&quot; in pain surgery
aim at interrupting the pathway of pain in one of its </p>

<p> three steps (neurons). The decision which method should be
used depends on character and localisation of </p>

<p> pain and requires well-founded experience by the surgeon.
&quot;Non-destructive&quot; operations include stimulation </p>

<p> methods of several CNS areas as well as implantation of drug
reservoirs which conceded a continuous </p>

<p> release of morphine or morphine derivatives to the opiate
receptors of the spinal cord. The paper evaluates </p>

<p> the most common surgical procedures in pain relief concerning
technique, indication and efficacy and gives a </p>

<p> survey on the pathophysiological background of chronic pain.

<p> patients </p>

<p> AB - Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) represents a
drug-delivery system in which patients self-administer </p>

<p> predetermined doses of opiate analgesics. We have taken
advantage of recent advances in pump technology </p>

<p> and developed a system in which patients with severe pain
received a continuous narcotic infusion, along </p>

<p> with the capability of PCA bolus for breakthrough pain. All
patients were experiencing chronic pain related </p>

<p> to cancer and were unable to obtain adequate pain control
with either intermittent parenteral, oral, or rectal </p>

<p> narcotics. Sixty-nine percent of patients were treated in the
home setting, and the majority received </p>

<p> morphine sulfate subcutaneously (SQ). Admixture stability
studies using high-pressure liquid </p>

<p> chromatography (HPLC) showed that dexamethasone,
metoclopramide, and haloperidol could be added to </p>

<p> the morphine solutions and remain stable for 1 week at room
temperature. Of 117 patients entered, 95% </p>

<p> received excellent pain control, and side effects were rare,
consisting of subcutaneous needle site infection </p>

<p> and respiratory depression. Progressive pain due to either
advancing disease or development of drug </p>

<p> tolerance could be controlled by increasing opiate infusion
rates. We conclude that (1) continuous infusion </p>

<p> opiate with PCA bolus capability can be initiated and
administered safely in the home setting; (2) patients </p>

<p> with pain related to malignancy can be managed well with this
system; and (3) pain control programs can be </p>

naloxone, at doses normally employed for opioid </p>

mice in the formalin test. We report here that </p>

<p> another opioid antagonists, naltrexone, also produces

<p> mice were injected subcutaneously with naltrexone (0.01-1.0

<p> AB - The aim of the present study has been to assess the
responsiveness of various types of chronic pain to </p>

<p> opioids given i.v. and tested against placebo in a
double-blind, randomized fashion. Pain classified as primary </p>

<p> nociceptive was effectively alleviated (P greater than 0.001)
while neuropathic deafferentation pain was not </p>

<p> significantly influenced by morphine or equivalent doses of
other opioids. Also 'idiopathic' pain, defined as </p>

<p> chronic pain with no or little demonstrable pathology, failed
to respond. The results were not related to </p>

<p> whether the patients were regular users of narcotic
analgesics or not. The outcome of our double-blind </p>

<p> opioid test has proved useful to justify a continued, or
discontinued, use of narcotic medication in individual </p>

<p> patients. It may also support the indication and choice of
invasive stimulation procedures (spinal cord or </p>

<p> brain). The results of the study illustrate the misconception
of chronic pain as an entity and highlight the </p>

<p> importance of recognizing different neurobiological
mechanisms and differences in responsiveness to </p>

<p> analgesic drugs as well as to non-pharmacological modes of
treatment. The opioid test has thus become a </p>

<p> TI - Impact of non-narcotic oral analgesics on pain
management. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - Of the four categories of oral analgesics, three have
been available since the 19th century. Although </p>

<p> adequate doses of the more potent oral opioids such as
morphine and methadone are effective even in severe </p>

<p> pain, the commonly used &quot;weak&quot; narcotics such as
codeine and propoxyphene are no more effective than </p>

<p> usual doses of aspirin or acetaminophen. Furthermore, the
opioids produce gastrointestinal and central </p>

<p> nervous system adverse effects, and, during long-term
administration, tolerance may develop and there is a </p>

<p> risk of drug dependence. Aspirin and acetaminophen are the
traditional agents of choice for oral analgesic </p>

<p> therapy; until 10 years ago, there were no single-entity,
oral analgesics--with the exception of large doses of </p>

<p> oral narcotics--that were more effective than usual doses of
aspirin or acetaminophen. However, there is a </p>

<p> ceiling on the analgesic effect attainable with safe doses of
these drugs, which may in part be overcome </p>

<p> through the use of the third category of oral analgesics,
combinations of aspirin or acetaminophen with oral </p>

<p> opioids. The fourth category of oral analgesics constitutes
the most important recent development in pain </p>

<p> management with analgesic drugs: the newer peripherally
acting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics, </p>

<p> some of which are clearly more efficacious than aspirin or
acetaminophen and compare favorably not only </p>

<p> with full doses of narcotic combination products but even, in
some cases, with strong injectable opioids. On </p>

<p> repeated dosing, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
are better tolerated than aspirin and some have </p>

<p> a much longer duration of analgesic effect than aspirin or
acetaminophen. Further study is needed to </p>

<p> compare nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs among themselves
and to determine their value in chronic </p>

<p> pain and in combination therapy. [References: 37] </p>

<p> AB - Chronic pain patients share many characteristics, but
there is important prognostic variability among </p>

<p> them. By selecting for certain characteristics, different
recruitment methods and entry criteria for clinical or </p>

<p> research programs may influence the likelihood of success
regardless of treatment efficacy. This was </p>

<p> demonstrated when subjects (n = 55) were recruited through
lay publicity for a clinical trial of therapy for </p>

<p> chronic back pain. In comparison to routine pain clinic
patients (n=61), subjects in the clinical trial were </p>

<p> better educated, were more often employed, had more favorable
personality profiles, and were less likely to </p>

<p> have had surgery or narcotic use (all p less than 0.004).
Pain relief was significantly better for clinical trial </p>

<p> subjects, apparently due to baseline prognostic differences
rather than uniquely efficacious therapy. We </p>

<p> conclude that chronic pain patients vary in prognostically
important ways; that recruitment methods and </p>

<p> criteria strongly influence these characteristics; and that
greater attention to these details is needed when </p>

the MMPI. A program that attempts to engender </p>

<p> a high level of patient responsibility in a population of

(with attrition controlled) at six months and 12 </p>

deterioration (ie, return to pretreatment levels of drug </p>

<p> dependence). Thus, it appears that the programmatic impact is

addicts were enrolled in a propoxyphene </p>

<p> maintenance program and had received 800-1600 mg of
propoxyphene napsylate daily for 13-50 months. </p>

<p> Serum propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene ranged from 127 to
1070 ng/mL and 814 to 2638 ng/mL, </p>

<p> respectively, and their ratio ranged from 0.1 to 0.4. A
roughly linear dose-to-serum-concentration </p>

<p> relationship was found for serum propoxyphene and
norpropoxyphene in the cohort. Cyclic </p>

<p> dinorpropoxyphene was detected in three of the subjects'
sera. Because tolerance to propoxyphene occurs, </p>

<p> knowledge of prior drug exposure is necessary to determine
whether an elevated propoxyphene or </p>

<p> norpropoxyphene concentration is toxic to patients or
decedents with apparent propoxyphene overdose. </p>

<p> Serum norpropoxyphene concentration exceeds that of
propoxyphene following chronic propoxyphene use. </p>

<p> AB - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether
regression of sensory analgesia during constant </p>

<p> epidural bupivacaine infusion was different in postoperative
patients with acute pain than in patients with </p>

<p> chronic nonsurgical pain. Sensory levels of analgesia (to
pinprick) and pain (on a five-point scale) were </p>

<p> assessed hourly for 16 hours during continuous epidural
infusion of 0.5% plain bupivacaine (8 ml/hr) in 12 </p>

<p> patients with chronic nonsurgical pain and in 30 patients
after major abdominal surgery performed under </p>

<p> combined bupivacaine and halothane--N2O general anesthesia.
No opiates were given. If sensory analgesia </p>

<p> decreased more than five segments from the initial level or
if the pain score reached 2 (moderate pain), the </p>

<p> patient was removed from the study. Initial levels of sensory
analgesia after loading doses of 21.8 +/- 0.5 </p>

<p> and 19.3 +/- 0.8 ml bupivacaine 0.5% were similar (T3.8 +/-
0.3 and T3.8 +/- 0.5) in the surgical and </p>

<p> chronic pain patients, respectively (mean +/- SEM). Of the
surgical patients, only 4 of the 30 (13%) </p>

<p> maintained the initial level of sensory analgesia, and a pain
score below 2 throughout the study compared </p>

<p> with 7 of the 12 patients with chronic pain (58%) (P less
than 0.01). Mean duration of sensory blockade was </p>

<p> significantly longer (P less than 0.005) in the patients with
chronic pain than in surgical patients (13.1 +/- 1.2 </p>

<p> and 8.5 +/- 0.7 hours, respectively). Thus, surgical injury
hastens regression of sensory analgesia during </p>

<p> continuous epidural bupivacaine infusion. The underlying
mechanism remains to be determined </p>

<p> AB - To better understand the use of narcotic analgesics, the
hydromorphone concentration was measured </p>

<p> in serum samples from 43 patients with chronic severe pain
who were receiving this drug. At the time of </p>

<p> blood sampling, pain intensity, mood, and cognitive
performance were assessed. There was large individual </p>

<p> variation in the dose-drug level relationship. Seven patients
with bone or soft tissue pain and drug levels of </p>

<p> greater than or equal to 4 ng/ml had good pain control,
whereas 10 did not. None of 15 patients with levels </p>

<p> less than 4 ng/ml had pain control, despite drug doses
similar to those given patients with higher levels. Thus </p>

<p> 60% of the patients without control of their pain had
hydromorphone levels below the lowest level that </p>

<p> produced pain control. No patient with pain from nerve
infiltration or compression had good pain control, </p>

<p> irrespective of the drug level or dose. Poor mood correlated
with high pain intensity and low drug level. </p>

<p> Impaired cognitive performance was not related to drug level.
Knowing that there is a low concentration of </p>

<p> narcotic in the blood of a patient with chronic severe pain
who is receiving high drug doses and who shows </p>

<p> TI - Importance of effective pain control. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - Although the scientific study of pain in the modern
sense was initiated 150 years ago, and a number of </p>

<p> theories were subsequently proposed, until two decades ago
pain research remained conceptually stagnant </p>

<p> and the meager amount done was not commensurate with the
magnitude and clinical importance of pain. </p>

<p> Consequently, pain treatment remained somewhat empirical and
ineffective. Moreover, the knowledge and </p>

<p> effective therapeutic modalities that were available were not
properly applied, primarily because medical </p>

<p> students and physicians were not taught the basic principles
of pain management. Fortunately, during the </p>

<p> past 20 years significant advances have been made in our
knowledge of basic mechanisms of acute pain and </p>

<p> about some chronic pain syndromes, and a variety of new
therapeutic modalities have been introduced and </p>

<p> old ones have been refined. Among the most important advances
of the past decade have been the discovery </p>

<p> of opiate receptors, the extensive pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic studies of narcotics, the </p>

<p> development of very sensitive analytic techniques and
mathematic knowledge and many other advances </p>

<p> which have prompted the development of new drugs, novel drug
preparations and novel methods of </p>

<p> administration, of which intraspinal narcotic therapy is the
most important and widely used. [References: </p>

<p> TI - Which potent opioid? Important criteria for selection </p>

<p> AB - Opioids remain the drugs of choice for the treatment of
severe pain. In recent years several new potent </p>

<p> opioids have become available for clinical use. These newer
drugs are generally safer than the older </p>

<p> morphine-like compounds and their differing pharmacological
and pharmacokinetic properties allow the </p>

<p> physician to choose an appropriate drug according to the
clinical situation and need of an individual patient. </p>

<p> These drugs are classified according to their activity at the
opioid receptors. The opioid agonists produce </p>

<p> their pharmacological effect by an almost exclusive action at
mu-receptors. The agonist-antagonist group are </p>

<p> kappa-receptor agonists and either competitive antagonists at
the mu-receptor or weak mu-agonists. The use </p>

<p> of the potent opioid agonists, because of their potential for
causing respiratory depression, is restricted to </p>

<p> hospitals. Fentanyl, the oldest drug of this class, is
extensively used as a supplement to general anaesthesia, </p>

<p> or in high doses as a 'complete' anaesthetic for patients
undergoing cardiac surgery. Alfentanil and sufentanil </p>

<p> are newer fentanyl derivatives. Alfentanil is unique in
having a very short elimination half-life. This is a </p>

<p> particular advantage during short operations and for day-case
surgery. For longer operations alfentanil can </p>

<p> be given as a continuous infusion to supplement nitrous oxide
anaesthesia. Sufentanil is about 10 times more </p>

<p> potent than fentanyl and is more rapidly eliminated. Initial
reports suggest that it may be more effective than </p>

<p> fentanyl as an anaesthetic supplement and that recovery may
be more rapid. Both sufentanil and alfentanil </p>

<p> are also used in cardiac anaesthesia. The newer
agonist-antagonist opioids, butorphanol, nalbuphine and </p>

<p> buprenorphine, have largely replaced pentazocine in clinical
practice. Unlike pentazocine, they cause a low </p>

<p> incidence of dysphoric side effects. Like the pure agonists,
they cause respiratory depression; however, in </p>

<p> contrast to the pure agonists this is not dose related,
reaching a 'ceiling' as dose increases. The risk of </p>

<p> dependence is also less, so that these drugs are safer for
the treatment of chronic pain. Additionally, it is </p>

<p> particularly worth noting that buprenorphine and nalbuphine
cause minimal cardiovascular changes, and are </p>

<p> safe and effective drugs for treatment of pain associated
with myocardial infarction. Buprenorphine, which is </p>

<p> effective parenterally, orally and sublingually, has a
prolonged duration of action (up to 12 hours after a </p>

<p> single dose) </p>

<p> morphone (34 patients) or hydromorphone (22 patients) using a
portable disposable infusor. The infusion </p>

<p> was maintained for 26 +/- 14 days. Twenty-five patients (45%)
were discharged to the home for a mean </p>

<p> period of 18 days (range, 2-138). The mean daily increase in
dose was 2.6% +/- 1.4% of the initial dose. The </p>

<p> sc site needed to be changed every 8 days (range, 2-31).
Local toxicity consisted of infection in two patients </p>

<p> (3%), chemical irritation in three (5%), and bleeding in one
(2%). After 48 hours of treatment, 54 of 56 </p>

<p> over study designed to evaluate the capacity of
methylphenidate to potentiate the analgesic effect of </p>

<p> narcotics and/or to decrease sedation induced by narcotics.
In 28 evaluable patients, the intensity of pain </p>

<p> (visual analogue 0-100) and intake of extra doses of
analgesics (number of doses/day) were 43 +/- 27 and </p>

<p> 2.2 +/- 2.4 during methylphenidate, versus 55 +/- 24 (P less
than 0.02) and 2.9 +/- 2.9 (P less than 0.002) </p>

<p> during placebo, respectively. Activity and drowsiness (visual
analogue 0-100) were 57 +/- 25 and 58 +/- 24 </p>

<p> after methylphenidate, respectively, versus 41 +/- 26 (P less
than 0.05) and 45 +/- 27 (P less than 0.02) after </p>

<p> more useful drug in 23 cases (83%) and 20 cases (70%),
respectively (P less than 0.02). No cases of severe </p>

attenuate arthritic hyperventilation, and the </p>

neurones to a long-lasting nociceptive </p>

<p> stimulus, i.e., 50 microliter 5% formalin injected into the
corresponding receptive field in the ipsilateral hind </p>

<p> paw, and modulation of this response by an opioid. Formalin
produced a distinct biphasic excitatory </p>

<p> response in all convergent neurones tested; an immediate
acute or phasic peak of neuronal firing (mean </p>

<p> maximum 22 spikes/sec) 0-10 min post injection, and a second
more prolonged tonic excitatory response </p>

<p> (mean maximum 12 spikes/sec) over a period 20-65 min after
formalin. Cells only activated by innocuous </p>

<p> stimuli were not excited by formalin indicating the
involvement of C fibre afferents in the excitatory response </p>

<p> of convergent neurones to formalin. Both the biphasic nature
and the time course of the neuronal response </p>

<p> are similar to those observed in behavioural studies.
Intrathecal DAGO (Tyr-D-AlaGlyMePheGly-ol), a </p>

<p> potent and selective mu opioid receptor agonist, applied 20
min prior to formalin completely inhibited both </p>

<p> peaks of excitation. Co-administration of intrathecal
naloxone with the agonist restored the biphasic </p>

<p> response. By contrast, when the administration of naloxone
was delayed to 2 min post formalin so that </p>

<p> inhibition of the first peak by DAGO pretreatment occurred,
there was no subsequent second peak of </p>

<p> activity although antagonism of the opioid would have
occurred. When DAGO was applied 2 min post </p>

<p> formalin so the initial acute response occurred, the
inhibitory effect of the agonist on the second peak was </p>

<p> far less. Thus the relative ability of DAGO to modulate the
biphasic excitatory response of cells to formalin </p>

<p> depends on whether the agonist is administered prior to or
after the formalin and the appearance of the </p>

<p> second peak may depend on the presence of the first. These
results are discussed in light of the role of these </p>

<p> neurones in nociception, opioid effects and changes in neural
systems following peripheral stimuli </p>

treatment with flupirtine: preliminary results </p>

<p> of an ongoing twelve-month study with 200 patients suffering
from chronic pain states in arthrosis or </p>

<p> arthritis </p>

<p> AB - In order to investigate the efficacy and safety of
long-term treatment with flupirtine in patients with </p>

<p> chronic pain, in particular arthrosis and arthritis, a study
was planned which, when completed, will </p>

<p> encompass the treatment of 200 patients over a 12-month
period. The present paper is a preliminary report </p>

<p> of this ongoing study. The report deals with 104 patients: 55
of whom completed the 12-month treatment </p>

<p> period and a 2-week follow-up phase, during which flupirtine
was replaced by placebo in order to be able to </p>

<p> detect drug-withdrawal effects. Forty nine patients withdrew
from the study. Most of the patients were </p>

<p> suffering from degenerative rheumatic arthrosis or
inflammatory rheumatic arthritis. The average daily </p>

<p> dosage was 300 mg. The incidence of drop-outs was highest in
the first months with hardly any patients </p>

<p> withdrawing in the last six months. Fifteen patients dropped
out because of side effects (dizziness, nausea, </p>

<p> sleep disturbances, and headache). Ten patients dropped out
because of ineffectiveness, seven because of </p>

<p> side effects plus ineffectiveness, and three because of side
effects and other reasons. The remaining 14 </p>

<p> patients dropped out because of other or non-medical reasons.
For the 55 patients who completed the study, </p>

<p> the analgesic took effect within 45 minutes to 2 hours, the
duration of effect was 4-6 hours. Three-quarters </p>

<p> of the patients responded to the drug, one-quarter did not.
The analgesic effect remained constant during the </p>

<p> 12-month treatment, as did the average number of capsules
taken per month. There was no evidence that </p>

<p> tolerance developed. The most frequent side effects were
drowsiness (9% of patients), dizziness (11%), dry </p>

<p> mouth (5%) and pruritis (9%). The withdrawal symptom scale
completed every month during treatment (to </p>

<p> determine baseline values) and every day throughout the
2-week placebo post-treatment phase showed no </p>

<p> changes in the median. The mean value increased during the
withdrawal phase, however, indicating that the </p>

<p> symptomatology was more pronounced in some subjects. After
withdrawal, the non-specific symptoms </p>

<p> increased to a greater extent than symptoms from the opiate
scale. The symptoms were present throughout </p>

<p> the withdrawal phase. If the withdrawal phenomena had
corresponded to the flupirtine's terminal half-life, </p>

<p> then the symptoms ought to have been present mainly in the
first few days. There was a slight trend for </p>

<p> lowering systolic blood pressure but no changes in diastolic
blood pressure or heart rate, nor changes in the </p>

<p> ECG or laboratory analysis that could be related to
flupirtine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 </p>

approach. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - The treatment approach presented in this article is an
obvious departure from ways physicians are </p>

<p> typically trained to handle patients' pain complaints.
Traditional medical training focuses primarily on the </p>

<p> management of acute pain. Unfortunately, the treatment
modalities appropriate for acute pain are not </p>

<p> applicable to most chronic pain disorders. Since physicians'
practices contain many chronic pain patients, it is </p>

<p> important for them to develop a more comprehensive and
effective approach to the management of CLBP. </p>

<p> Through the use of case vignettes, this article has attempted
to elucidate some common problems </p>

<p> experienced by patients with CLBP. It is a complex disorder
that requires that the physicians be sensitive to </p>

<p> the biologic, psychologic, and social aspects of the illness.
Simply handing a patient with CLBP a set of back </p>

<p> exercises or prescriptions for narcotics and sedatives will
not be beneficial. Rather, the patient must be </p>

<p> educated about the pain and taught to take an active role in
his own treatment. By working with patients and </p>

<p> their families, physicians can teach patients with CLBP the
self-management skills essential for the </p>

<p> resumption of a normal, productive life. [References: 30] </p>

neuroanatomical approach identifies </p>

<p> alterations in multiple opioid systems in the periaqueductal
grey </p>

<p> AB - Inoculation of the tail base of rats with Mycobacterium
butyricum led to an arthritic swelling and </p>

<p> inflammation of the limbs which displayed a hyperalgesia to
noxious pressure: these effects peaked at 3 </p>

<p> weeks postinoculation. In vitro autoradiography of coronal
sections of rat brain was used for a parallel </p>

<p> determination of binding to mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid
binding sites. In only two regions, the dorsomedial </p>

<p> and dorsolateral parts of the periaqueductal grey (PAG), was
a significant change seen: this comprised an </p>

<p> increase in binding to kappa-sites, whereas mu- and
delta-sites therein were unaffected. This region was </p>

<p> analysed for opioid peptides derived from each of the three
opioid peptide families known. While no change </p>

<p> was seen in levels of immunoreactive (ir)-dynorphin1-17 A
(DYN) and ir-Met-enkephalin, a decrease was </p>

<p> detected in those of ir-beta-endorphin (beta-EP): this change
was restricted to the PAG. These data </p>

<p> demonstrate a highly localized and selective influence of
chronic arthritic pain upon multiple opioid systems </p>

<p> in the PAG of the rat, a structure playing a key role in the
control of pain and in the expression of the </p>

<p> antinociceptive actions of opioids. The data suggest a
possible significance of PAG pools of beta-EP and </p>

<p> kappa-receptors in the response to and modulation of chronic
pain </p>

correlates of alterations in the activity of opioid </p>

<p> systems </p>

<p> AB - Intradermal inoculation of rats at the tail base with
Mycobacterium butyricum led to the gradual </p>

<p> development of an arthritic swelling of the limbs which
peaked at 3 weeks and subsided thereafter. Arthritic </p>

<p> rats displayed a loss of body weight, hypophagia, and
hypodipsia in addition to a disruption of the diurnal </p>

<p> rhythms of ingestive behavior and of core temperature. The
activity of adenohypophyseal beta-endorphin- </p>

<p> (beta-EP) secreting corticotrophs, in contrast to
prolactin-(PRL) secreting lactotrophs, was increased in </p>

<p> arthritic rats. Indeed, hypertrophy of the adrenal glands was
seen. Arthritic rats also showed an elevation in </p>

<p> spinal cord levels of immunoreactive dynorphin (DYN), an
endogenous ligand of the kappa-opioid receptor. </p>

<p> The paws and tail of arthritic rats showed lower thresholds
in response to noxious pressure (hyperalgesia), </p>

<p> higher thresholds in response to noxious heat (hypoalgesia),
and no change in their response to noxious </p>

<p> electrical stimulation. Neither naloxone nor ICI-154, 129 (a
preferential delta-receptor antagonist) modified </p>

<p> the responses of the paw or tail to pressure. However, MR
2266 (an antagonist with higher activity at </p>

<p> kappa-receptors) decreased thresholds to pressure in
arthritic, but not control, rats; that is, it potentiated the </p>

<p> hyperalgesia. This action was stereospecific. None of the
antagonists modified the response to heat. MR </p>

<p> 2266 did not affect the response to pressure in rats with
acute inflammation produced by yeast. Thus, the </p>

<p> potentiation of pressure hyperalgesia by MR 2266 in chronic
arthritic rats is highly selective. Arthritic rats </p>

<p> showed a reduced response to the analgesic effect of a
kappa-agonist (U-50, 488H), whereas the response </p>

<p> to a mu-agonist (morphine) was enhanced. These effects were
specific to nociception in that their influence </p>

<p> upon endocrine secretion (PRL and beta-EP) was otherwise
changed. The secretion of beta-EP and PRL </p>

<p> was stimulated by both morphine and U-50,488H, and the
influence of U-50,488H upon the release of beta- </p>

<p> EP (from the adenohypophysis) was enhanced in arthritic rats.
It is suggested that polyarthritis is a complex </p>

<p> condition entailing many changes, both behavioral and
endocrinological. Further, arthritic rats cannot simply </p>

<p> be described as &quot;hyperalgesic&quot;: of critical
importance is the nature of the nociceptive stimulus applied. The
</p>

<p> parallel alterations in spinal cord pools of DYN and
kappa-receptors (see also Millan et al., 1986) and the </p>

<p> changes in the influence on nociception of kappa-agonists and
kappa-antagonists suggest an increased </p>

<p> activity of spinal DYN. Thus, spinal kappa-receptors may play
a role in the modulation of nociception under </p>

<p> chronic pain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </p>

<p> Evidence for a non-opioid mechanism </p>

<p> AB - Pain relief following stimulation of the periaqueductal
gray matter (PAG) or periventricular gray </p>

<p> matter (PVG) in man has been ascribed to stimulation-induced
release of endogenous opioid substances. </p>

<p> Forty-five patients were studied and followed for at least 1
year after placement of chronic stimulating </p>

<p> electrodes in the PAG or PVG to determine if pain relief due
to stimulation could be ascribed to an </p>

<p> endogenous opioid mechanism. Three criteria were assessed:
the development of tolerance to stimulation; </p>

<p> the possibility of cross-tolerance to morphine; and
reversibility of stimulation-induced pain relief by the </p>

<p> opiate antagonist naloxone. Sixteen patients (35.6%)
developed tolerance to stimulation, that is, they </p>

<p> obtained progressively less effective pain relief. Twelve
(44.4%) of 27 patients undergoing stimulation of the </p>

<p> thalamic sensory relay nuclei for treatment of chronic pain
(a presumably non-opioid mechanism) also </p>

<p> developed tolerance. Morphine sulfate was administered in a
blind, placebo-controlled protocol to 10 </p>

<p> patients who had become tolerant to PAG-PVG stimulation and
none showed evidence of cross-tolerance. </p>

<p> Fifteen of 19 patients, already tolerant to morphine at the
time of PAG-PVG electrode implantation, </p>

<p> experienced excellent pain relief by stimulation, also
indicating a lack of cross-tolerance. Twenty-two </p>

<p> patients who experienced excellent pain relief from chronic
PAG-PVG stimulation received intravenous </p>

<p> naloxone in a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. Pain
intensity as assessed by the visual analog scale </p>

<p> was increased to the same degree by both placebo and
naloxone. Eight patients showed no increase in pain </p>

<p> intensity with either placebo or naloxone. Although tolerance
to PAG-PVG stimulation developed in these </p>

<p> patients, the frequency of tolerance was similar to that seen
in patients undergoing thalamic sensory nuclear </p>

<p> stimulation. Since the latter technique presumably relieves
pain by a non-opioid mechanism, the development </p>

<p> of tolerance to PAG-PVG stimulation does not, in itself,
confirm an opioid mechanism. Cross-tolerance </p>

<p> between PAG-PVG stimulation and morphine was not seen and
cross-tolerance to PAG-PVG stimulation in </p>

<p> patients already tolerant to morphine was rare. The
pain-relieving effect of PAG-PVG stimulation was </p>

<p> reversed to an approximately equal degree by naloxone and
placebo. The authors do not believe that, in </p>

<p> most patients, pain relief elicited by PAG-PVG stimulation
depends on an endogenous opioid mechanism. It </p>

<p> appears that other, non-opioid mechanisms are primarily
responsible for such pain relief </p>

<p> AB - During a period of one year, 119 patients with chronic
pain received injections of opioids via a </p>

<p> catheter inserted in the lumbar epidural space. Twenty-three
patients (19%) showed evidence of tolerance </p>

<p> and were given droperidol 1.25-5.0 mg epidurally. In 20
patients in this study, there was a significant </p>

<p> reduction in the number of epidural opioid injections. Six
patients complained of excessive sedation, which </p>

<p> disappeared when the dose of droperidol was reduced, although
this did not affect the analgesia. One patient </p>

beneficial as supplementary medication to </p>

implantation to control their chronic pain; two </p>

<p> had electrodes implanted bilaterally. All patients obtained
complete analgesia with stimulation, although 3 </p>

<p> subsequently found the stimulation to have diminished
efficacy. The opiate antagonist naloxone reversed the </p>

died of causes unrelated to electrode implantation or </p>

electrodes implanted, the electrode tip was </p>

posterior commissure; the other 3 electrodes were found </p>

<p> in the white matter adjacent to the PAG. No evidence of

<p> AB - Chronic arthritic pain was induced by intradermally
inoculating rats at the tail-base with </p>

<p> Mycobacterium butyricum, which results in swelling,
inflammation, and hyperalgesia of the joints. These </p>

<p> symptoms peak at 3 weeks after inoculation and disappear by
10 weeks. The following changes were seen at </p>

<p> 3 weeks. Immunoreactive dynorphin (ir-Dyn) and
ir-alpha-neo-endorphin (alpha-NE) manifested comparable </p>

<p> patterns of change. Their levels were increased in the
anterior, but not neurointermediate, pituitary. The </p>

<p> thalamus showed a rise in ir-Dyn and ir-alpha-NE, but no
alterations were seen in other brain regions. In </p>

<p> each case, cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral sections of
the spinal cord showed a rise in ir-Dyn and ir- </p>

<p> alpha-NE: This was most pronounced in the lumbosacral region,
where the magnitude of these shifts </p>

<p> correlated with the intensity of arthritic symptoms. In
addition, a moderate elevation in ir-methionine- </p>

<p> enkephalin (ME) was seen in lumbosacral spinal cord. In
brain, ir was not changed. The level of ir-beta- </p>

<p> endorphin (beta-EP) was elevated both in the plasma and the
anterior, but not the neurointermediate, </p>

<p> pituitary. In addition, the content of messenger RNA encoding
the beta-EP precursor, proopiomelanocortin </p>

<p> (POMC), was enhanced in the anterior lobe. Thus, there was a
selective activation of synthesis of beta-EP </p>

<p> in, and its secretion from, the anterior lobe. In no brain
tissue did levels of ir-beta-EP change. At 10 weeks </p>

<p> postinoculation, the above changes were no longer apparent,
indicating their reversibility.(ABSTRACT </p>

<p> AB - AB - To assess the safety, efficacy, and use of

<p> we reviewed the clinical experience of 36 patients who

<p> of repetitive dosing of opioids. Morphine was used in 36 CIs,
methadone in four, hydromorphone in four, </p>

<p> oxymorphone in one, and levorphanol in one. Mean doses during
CI were the morphine equivalent of 17 </p>

<p> mg/hour (range, 0.7-100) at the start, 69 mg/hour (range, 4-
480) at the maximum, and 52 mg/hour (range, </p>

<p> 1-480) at termination. Pain relief was acceptable during 28
CIs, unacceptable during 17, and unknown </p>

<p> during one. There were few toxic effects other than sedation.
Twenty-five patients died, 12 resumed im or </p>

<p> TI - INTRAVENOUS INFUSION OF OPIOIDS IN CANCER-RELATED PAIN:
REVIEW OF CASES </p>

<p> AND GUIDELINES FOR USE </p>

<p> AB - AB - Continuous iv infusion (CI) of opioid analgesics as
an alternative approach to analgesia has </p>

<p> found increasing use in the management of postoperative pain
and chronic pain. Despite the popularity of </p>

<p> CI, little documentation exists for its safety and efficacy.
In order to assess these concerns, clinical </p>

<p> characteristics of 46 infusions in 36 patients with
cancer-related pain were reviewed retrospectively. Hospital </p>

<p> charts were analyzed for patient characteristics, prior
opioid exposure, rationale for iv administration of drug </p>

<p> and for CI, course of infusion, and outcome. Details of the
characteristics of the study population are </p>

<p> presented in a table. All patients had cancer and all but one
had active disease. Thirty-two patients had pain </p>

<p> due to tumor invasion, whereas three had pain caused by
cancer therapy and one had pain unrelated to the </p>

<p> diagnosis of cancer. All patients had been exposed to opioid
medications before the CI was begun. Thirty-six </p>

<p> infusions were begun with morphine sulfate, while methadone
was used in four infusions, hydromorphone in </p>

<p> four, oxymorphone in one, and levorphanol in one. Additional
medications, including the opioid analgesics, </p>

<p> were often given during the CI; their nature and frequency of
use are tabulated. During 42 infusions, the max </p>

<p> infusion rate was greater than that at the start; during 17
infusions, the rate at CI termination was lower than </p>

<p> the max rate. Three patterns of dosing during CI were

<p> of CI ranged from 1 to 45 days. Five patients were treated

<p> days, 7 for 14-21 days, 3 for 22-29 days, 2 for 30-37 days,

<p> maintained until the patients died. Side effects due to the
CI were difficult to determine precisely, since </p>

<p> 34/46 patients were receiving repetitive iv bolus injections
of opioids prior to CI, and the medical conditions </p>

<p> of the patients were often deteriorating during the infusion.
Progressive sedation was by far the most </p>

<p> common side effect during CI. Respiratory depression, easily
reversed with iv naloxone, occurred in a single </p>

report of 38 cases </p>

<p> AB - AB - Thirty-eight patients maintained on opioid
analgesics for non- malignant pain were </p>

<p> retrospectively evaluated to determine the indications,
course, safety and efficacy of this therapy. Oxycodone </p>

<p> was used by 12 patients, methadone by 7, and levorphanol by
5; others were treated with propoxyphene, </p>

<p> meperidine, codeine, pentazocine, or some combination of
these drugs. Nineteen patients were treated for </p>

<p> four or more years at the time of evaluation, while 6 were
maintained for more than 7 years. Two-thirds </p>

<p> required less than 20 morphine equivalent mg/day and only 4
took more than 40 mg/day. Patients </p>

<p> occasionally required escalation of dose and/or
hospitalization for exacerbation of pain; doses usually </p>

<p> returned to a stable baseline afterward. Twenty-four patients
described partial but acceptable or fully </p>

<p> adequate relief of pain, while 14 reported inadequate relief.
No patient underwent a surgical procedure for </p>

<p> pain management while receiving therapy. Few substantial
gains in employment or social function could be </p>

<p> attributed to the institution of opioid therapy. No toxicity
was reported and management became a problem </p>

<p> in only 2 patients, both with a history of prior drug abuse.
A critical review of patient characteristics, </p>

<p> including data from the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire
in 24 patients, the Minnesota Multiphasic </p>

<p> Personality Inventory in 23, and detailed psychiatric
evaluation in 6, failed to disclose psychological or social </p>

<p> variables capable of explaining the success of long-term
management. We conclude that opioid maintenance </p>

<p> therapy can be a safe, salutary and more humane alternative
to the options of surgery or no treatment in </p>

<p> questionnaire in a population of 40 male and 29 female
confirmed heroin addicts. Responses of males and </p>

responses, and both rated feelings like sexual orgasm </p>

<p> relatively low, rank 9 for males and 15 for females. However,

<p> TI - Epidural catheter analgesia for the management of
postoperative pain. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - Since its introduction to North America in 1942, the use
of epidural catheter analgesia has increased </p>

<p> dramatically. Improved equipment, methods and medications
have broadened its application to include </p>

<p> among others, surgical anesthesia, chronic pain relief and
the management of postoperative pain. Numerous </p>

<p> techniques for epidural puncture and insertion of the
catheter have been described. Although complications </p>

<p> have been associated with placement of an epidural catheter,
these are rare when performed by an </p>

<p> experienced anesthesiologist. Epidural analgesia was first
accomplished by blockade with local anesthetics. </p>

<p> Bupivacaine has been called the local anesthetic of choice
for epidural infusion. Bolus administration of </p>

<p> epidural local anesthetics gives effective analgesia;
however, its use is limited by brief duration and </p>

<p> occasionally severe hypotension. Epidural local anesthetics
have been administered by continuous infusion in </p>

<p> an attempt to minimize side effects. Nevertheless,
hypotension, as well as motor block, numbness, nausea </p>

<p> and urinary retention have occurred. Epidural analgesia with
local anesthetics is effective in relieving </p>

<p> postoperative pain, but its safety and feasibility have been
questioned because of the frequent, potentially </p>

<p> serious side effects. These problems led to trials of
epidural narcotics for postoperative pain management. </p>

<p> The exact site of action of epidural narcotic analgesics is
debatable; however, the bulk of evidence supports </p>

<p> a direct spinal action. Epidural narcotics appear to
specifically inhibit nociceptive stimuli. The prolonged and </p>

<p> profound analgesia that occurs with epidural narcotics
relative to parenteral administration is due to a higher </p>

<p> concentration of drug reaching the CSF through the epidural
route. Since nervous transmission is not </p>

<p> completely blocked this technique cannot provide anesthesia
during operation. Morphine has been the most </p>

<p> frequently used narcotic for epidural analgesia. Results of
several recent, randomized double-blind studies </p>

<p> have shown that epidural narcotics give adequate analgesia
comparable with that observed with epidural </p>

<p> bupivacaine. Epidural morphine provides a greater duration of
analgesia and may cause fewer side effects. </p>

<p> Improved analgesia has been reported when epidural narcotics
are used in combination with local </p>

<p> anesthetics. Continuous administration of low dosage epidural
narcotics has been shown to have less </p>

<p> frequent side effects than bolus administration.
Nevertheless, pruritus, urinary retention, hypotension and </p>

<p> severe respiratory depression have been reported with both
methods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 </p>

<p> AB - AB - Levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) is an orphan drug
that will soon be generally available to </p>

<p> treatment facilities. We have recently treated 959 opioid
addicts with LAAM for periods up to 36 </p>

<p> consecutive months. Three times per week dosing of LAAM
proved to be a safe and effective treatment </p>

<p> agent for the majority of subjects. During LAAM induction
there is a delay in opioid activity as LAAM </p>

<p> forms its long-acting metabolites, therefore, symptomatic
withdrawal medication must usually be </p>

<p> administered during the first 96 hours of treatment to
adequately suppress opioid withdrawal symptoms and </p>

<p> prevent self- administration of drugs by the patient. No
long-term hepatic toxicity or tumor formation could </p>

<p> be demonstrated by liver function studies and liver-spleen
imaging in a subgroup of patients. Some opioid </p>

<p> addicts report that they prefer LAAM over methadone, but the
reverse was reported by about 40% of our </p>

<p> patients which suggests that both drugs are needed for
adequate maintenance treatment of the opioid- </p>

<p> AB - Analgesic studies of buprenorphine, a thebaine

<p> carried out in patients with cancer who had postoperative or
chronic pain. Intramuscular buprenorphine was </p>

<p> compared with intramuscular morphine in a series of
sequentially related, twin crossover assays and was </p>

<p> found to be about 25 times as potent as morphine. Side
effects were essentially morphine-like. In a second </p>

<p> assay, the acceptability and analgesic activity of sublingual
buprenorphine was studied in a 6-dose, balanced, </p>

<p> incomplete block assay, a modification of the twin crossover
design employed in the all-intramuscular trial. </p>

<p> Sublingual buprenorphine was found to be about 15 times as
potent as intramuscular morphine and was well </p>

<p> accepted by our patients. The 4-dose twin crossover trial in
which doses are adjusted sequentially is more </p>

<p> TI - Diagnostic epidural opioid blockade and chronic pain:
preliminary report </p>

<p> AB - A technique is described which helps in the
differentiation between pain of a mainly physical (organic) </p>

<p> and emotional (psychogenic) basis. This is based upon the
patients' subjective response to the epidural </p>

<p> administration of fentanyl and placebo agents. Patients
initially had both physical and psychological </p>

<p> assessment in a multidisciplinary pain management unit and
because of doubt of the underlying diagnosis, </p>

<p> were subjected to this procedure. Eight patients are
described in whom the following solutions were </p>

<p> administered at 20 min intervals: 2 aliquots of normal saline
(5 ml) via an epidural catheter; 1 microgram/kg </p>

<p> fentanyl via the epidural catheter; intravenous naloxone 0.4
mg, then, depending upon results obtained, 15- </p>

<p> 20 ml 2% plain lignocaine via the epidural catheter. If a
patient's visual analogue score decreased following </p>

<p> epidural fentanyl and subsequently increased following
naloxone, then a predominantly physical basis for the </p>

<p> pain was likely. In contrast, little change in visual
analogue score following fentanyl and naloxone suggested </p>

<p> a diagnosis of a predominantly emotional basis for the pain.
The diagnoses were substantiated by subsequent </p>

<p> follow-up and treatment. It is suggested that this test has
both prognostic and diagnostic value when used in </p>

<p> the context of thorough physical and psychologic assessment
of a patient with chronic pain </p>

<p> AB - D-Ala-D-Leu-enkephalin (DADL) is a pentapeptide which,
compared to morphine, preferentially </p>

<p> binds to the delta receptor. We compared the analgesic and
side effects of intrathecal (i.t.) DADL and i.t. </p>

<p> morphine sulfate (MS) in 10 tolerant cancer patients with
chronic pain at or below the T12 level who were </p>

<p> receiving inadequate relief or unacceptable side effects from
systemic opiates. These patients were given i.t. </p>

<p> DADL and i.t. MS in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over
study on separate days at least 1 day apart. I.t. </p>

<p> DADL produced analgesia in all patients tested. Total pain
relief was greater with DADL than MS in 6 </p>

<p> patients, equal in 1 patient and less with DADL in 3. Side
effects, most commonly drowsiness, were similar </p>

<p> with both MS and DADL and suggest supraspinal effects by both
drugs. At the doses given i.t. DADL </p>

<p> produced effective pain relief in patients tolerant to
systemic opiates although no significant difference in </p>

<p> analgesic efficacy between MS and DADL was observed. Studies
of the relative analgesic potency of i.t. </p>

<p> TI - Nalbuphine. [Review] </p>

<p> AB - Nalbuphine is a potent analgesic with a low side effect
and dependence profile in animals and man. </p>

<p> Nalbuphine is distinguished from other agonist/antagonist
analgesics in having greater antagonist activity and </p>

<p> fewer behavioral effects at analgesic doses than pentazocine,
butorphanol or buprenorphine. At equi- </p>

<p> analgesic doses, nalbuphine is quantitatively similar to
nalorphine in regard to its large ratio of antagonist to </p>

<p> analgetic activity. Clinical studies have confirmed this
balance of strong antagonist to analgesic activity. </p>

<p> Nalbuphine has been shown to effectively antagonize the
respiratory depressant activity of narcotic </p>

<p> analgesics while concomitantly adding to their analgetic
responses. Unlike nalorphine or pentazocine, </p>

<p> nalbuphine produces few overt behavioral or autonomic effects
in animals at doses over 300 times its </p>

<p> analgesic range. These findings are confirmed by clinical
results which show that nalbuphine produces few </p>

<p> psychotomimetic effects, even at elevated dose levels, in
contrast to nalorphine or pentazocine. Nalbuphine </p>

<p> produces limited respiratory depression in animals and in
man. Significant cardiovascular effects have not </p>

<p> been found. Nalbuphine was found to produce significantly
less inhibition of gastrointestinal activity than any </p>

<p> of the clinically useful narcotic or agonist/antagonist
analgesics tested in animals. Nalbuphine's analgetic </p>

<p> effects are reversed by naloxone doses similar to those which
reverse nalorphine's agonist effects. Results in </p>

<p> this and other tests suggest that nalbuphine is primarily a
kappa-agonist/mu-antagonist analgesic. Unlike </p>

<p> pentazocine or buprenorphine, nalbuphine does not suppress
the narcotic abstinence syndrome in partly- </p>

<p> withdrawn morphine-dependent animals or man. Rather, due to
nalbuphine's strong antagonist activity, </p>

<p> analgesic-range doses of nalbuphine severely exacerbate the
withdrawal syndrome in partly-withdrawn mice, </p>

<p> monkeys and humans. Nalbuphine also precipitates a strong
abstinence response in non-withdrawn </p>

<p> morphine-dependent animals and man. In post-addict humans,
analgesic-range doses of nalbuphine are </p>

<p> perceived as minimally morphine-like, but higher doses are
judged to be progressively more nalorphine-like </p>

<p> (i.e. dysphoric), which further limits nalbuphine's abuse
potential in drug-seeking individuals. Primary </p>

<p> dependence studies have demonstrated that physical dependence
is possible at high dose levels that produce </p>

<p> marked side effects. Other studies show that dependence is
unlikely to be of significance within nalbuphine's </p>

<p> usual analgesic range. Six-month studies in patients with
chronic pain have confirmed that analgesic </p>

<p> tolerance or physical dependence is uncommon.(ABSTRACT

<p> TI - Newer methods of delivery of opiates for relief of pain.
[Review] </p>

<p> AB - Successful pain management using opiates requires both
an analgesic with sufficient intrinsic activity </p>

<p> and an effective administration system. Most instances of
unsatisfactory pain control, however, are due to </p>

<p> failure to achieve and maintain adequate blood concentrations
of the chosen drug. Newer techniques of </p>

<p> administration aim to overcome this problem. Oral opiate
therapy with conventional or sustained-release </p>

<p> formulations of morphine provide good control of terminal
cancer pain provided that a regular dosing </p>

<p> pattern is established and reviewed according to the
patient's needs. This represents a significant departure </p>

<p> from the traditional 'as required' prescription of this type
of drug. In the management of acute severe pain, </p>

<p> sublingual and intravenous opiates--self-administered as
needed, or given by mandatory dosing schedules-- </p>

<p> have also been shown to overcome the limitations of
intermittent intramuscular injections. A further novel </p>

<p> development, stemming from basic neuroscience research, is
the selective application of opiates to the spinal </p>

<p> cord via the epidural or intrathecal route. This
controversial technique has led to major improvements in </p>

<p> treatment of some types of acute and chronic pain.

<p> AB - Forty-eight patients underwent electrical stimulation of
the brain for treatment of chronic pain </p>

<p> between 1978 and 1983. Average pain duration prior to
treatment was 4.5 years. Before selection for this </p>

<p> procedure patients underwent pain treatment in a
multidisciplinary pain center, intensive psychological and </p>

<p> psychiatric evaluation, and assessment of pain responsiveness
to intravenous administration of placebo, </p>

<p> morphine, and naloxone. A total of 71 electrodes were placed
in the 48 patients at a variety of stimulating </p>

<p> targets, including the periaqueductal gray matter,
periventricular gray matter, thalamus, and internal capsule. </p>

<p> Seventy-two percent of patients experienced complete or
partial pain relief. In addition, 59% of patients </p>

<p> were able to discontinue narcotic usage. Twenty-five percent
of patients returned to normal physical </p>

<p> activities and another 33% showed marked improvement in
functional capacity. Follow-up periods ranged </p>

<p> from 2 to 60 months; with a mean follow-up period of 20
months. A variety of relatively minor </p>

<p> complications occurred, but no mortality or permanent
sequelae were experienced. No patient's pain was </p>

<p> AB - Epidural opiates were administered to 139 patients with
pain due to malignant diseases via a chronic </p>

<p> indwelling catheter inserted percutaneously. So far, 9,716
days of treatment can be evaluated. In 87% of the </p>

<p> patients whose pain previously could not be controlled with
conventional analgesic approaches, epidural </p>

<p> opiates resulted in remarkable pain relief. With a mean daily
dose of 15.6 mg morphine (range 2-290 mg) or </p>

<p> 0.86 mg buprenorphine (range 0.15-7.2 mg) half of the
patients could be treated as outpatients. The mean </p>

<p> duration of therapy was 72 days (range 1-700 days), 26
catheters being in place for more than 100 days and </p>

<p> one catheter being in place for 510 days. Two severe
side-effects (meningitis) were observed, both patients </p>

<p> being free of symptoms after catheter removal and antibiotic
therapy. Epidural opiates proved to be a </p>

<p> valuable method of pain control in terminal illness. The
method should be reserved for those patients, for </p>

Formalin test, compared with the saline control, after </p>

<p> administration of choline (30 or 60 mg/kg), atropine (2
mg/kg), mecamylamine (2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg), or </p>

evidence of analgesia produced by any of these </p>

analgesia. A double blind study following abdominal </p>

<p> AB - A randomized double-blind study was done to test the two
opiates buprenorphine (0.3 mg i.v.) and </p>

<p> pentazocine (30 mg i.v.) with regard to their applicability
for the postoperative phase. These substances </p>

<p> were chosen because they are not subject to drug prescription
regulations. 60 patients who had undergone </p>

<p> epigastric and hypogastric interventions under
thiopental-sodium-induced halothane anesthesia received i.v. </p>

<p> injections of one of the two analgetics as soon as they
requested a pain-killer postoperatively. The subjective </p>

<p> pain intensity registered by means of a visual analogue scale
shows a gradual decrease after buprenorphine </p>

<p> with maximal effects 1-3 h post injectionem (7.3 leads to
1.5). The duration of action is 8.2 +/- 0.7 h on the </p>

<p> average (median 8 h; range 4-22 h). The maximal analgetic
effect of pentazocine is already attained after 10 </p>

<p> min (6.3 leads to 3.2). Thereafter the pain-intensity curve
rises again. Pentazocine has a mean duration of </p>

<p> action of 2.35 +/- 0.24 h (median 2 h; range 0.5-5 h). The
inadequate analgetic effect of pentazocine </p>

<p> manifests itself in an only slight initial reduction of the
respiratory rate (19.5 leads to 17.5 min-1), which, on </p>

<p> the other hand, decreases significantly and continuously
under buprenorphine (20.8 leads to 13.5 min-1). </p>

<p> Both substances cause increases of PaCO2 (buprenorphine 37.3
leads to 46.8 mmHg; pentazocine 36.3 leads </p>

<p> to 43.0 mmHg), values greater than 50 mmHg being attained in
individual cases.(ABSTRACT </p>

11 h after epidural buprenorphine. The overall </p>

<p> amount of morphine in the postoperative period was 13.3 +/-
14.9 mg and 0.89 +/- 0.55 mg buprenorphine </p>

limits itself to study of the nervous system, </p>

<p> although there are equally important effects in the
circulatory and endocrine systems. Previous research by </p>

<p> the author has shown that acupuncture effects on the
microcirculatory system can normally be classified into </p>

<p> 3 consecutively changing phases: vasoconstriction,
quasi-control, and vasodilation of capillaries and </p>

<p> arterioles. Vasodilation effects are often accompanied by
significant blood chemistry and complete blood </p>

<p> count changes, most of which resemble ACTH effects. Changes
such as generalized vasodilation effects can </p>

<p> give various degrees of improvement in insomnia,
irritability, impaired learning, memory, and brain </p>

<p> circulation. Pain threshold to electrical stimulation is
often enhanced by acupuncture in the acupunctured </p>

<p> blind conditions to 36 outpatients for 21- day heroin
detoxification. The initial dosage was 24 mg/day for </p>

<p> methadone hydrochloride and 800 mg/day for propoxyphene
napsylate. At these dosages, methadone more </p>

<p> effectively suppressed the opiate- withdrawal syndrome, and
patients remained in treatment longer in the </p>

abstinence, however, results were not statistically </p>

<p>Source: Clin-J-Pain. 1995 Jun. 11(2). P 103-11. </p>

<p>Journal Title: CLINICAL JOURNAL OF PAIN. </p>

<p>Abstract: </p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: In clinical practice, patients with chronic pain
frequently report problems with memory functioning. This issue,
however, has received little attention in the scientific
literature. The present study was designed to investigate this
common problem and to stimulate research interest in this
neglected and important area. </p>

<p>DESIGN: Self-reported memory problems were investigated in two
groups of chronic pain patients--patients with pain from
acceleration-deceleration automobile accidents (n = 56) and
patients with pain from various work accidents (n = 27)--and two
control groups involving medical/dental (n = 24) and
psychotherapy patients (n = 20). SETTING: Private practice,
chronic pain, rehabilitation psychology services. RESULTS: Our
findings suggest that memory complaints are higher in patients
with chronic pain than in medical/dental or psychotherapy
patients. No differences were found between chronic pain groups.
On more general measures of memory complaint, differences between
pain patients and controls were attributed to the severity of
patients' depression. On a questionnaire designed to be more
specific to memory complaint in chronic pain patients,
differences in memory complaint between pain patients and
controls were found, even after the effects due to depression
were statistically removed. Although pain patients often
attribute their memory problems to codeine use and/or
psychoactive medications, there was no support for this in the
present study. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, these
findings suggest that memory complaints may be related not only
to depression but also to the presence of chronic pain. Further
research in this area is needed. </p>

<p>Abstract: Hypersensitivity to pain is a common component of
functional bowel disorders. Hyperalgesia may be induced by
various stimuli which produce a cocktail of inflammatory
mediators that decrease the pain threshold. Drugs able to block
these peripheral events within the gut may offer a new
pharmacological approach for treating functional bowel disorders.
Kappa opioids have been shown to inhibit somatic pain through a
peripheral mechanism of action, acting directly on receptors
located on peripheral sensory endings. They can block both the
nociceptive messages as well as the release of sensory peptides.
This paper reviews the effects of opioid agonists on gut visceral
pain and motility anomalies induced by visceral pain. Kappa
opioids have strong effects on all models tested, with a
peripheral mechanism of action allowing the design of drugs
acting only in the periphery and having no central nervous system
side- effects. This contrasts with mu agonists which are
centrally active on pain and worsen the subsequent transit and
motility anomalies. </p>

<p>Journal Title: CRNA. </p>

<p>Abstract: Preemptive analgesia describes a situation where the
administration of a pharmacological agent administered before the
onset of a painful stimulus causes a decrease in the intensity of
pain felt, and subsequently there is a decrease in the total
amount of analgesic required compared with the administration of
an agent after a painful stimulus. It is best understood if it is
thought of as a block to afferent impulses that are trying to
reach the central nervous system before a tissue injury.
Preemptive analgesia, administered in the form of narcotics,
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, or local anesthetics, is
thought to alter peripheral and central sensitization to
nociceptive impulses. </p>

<p>Abstract: 1. When the analgesic effect of salmon-calcitonin
(S-CT) and of eel-calcitonin (E-CT), as well as their influence
on the morphine-analgesia were compared, no significant
differences were found. 2. While on isolated tissues, E-CT
induced a significant increase on the effect of bremazocine,
[D-Pen2,D- Pen5]enkephalin and [Met5]enkephalin and no changes
were observed on the effect of DAMGO, suggesting that E-CT
increases the effects of opioids acting on delta or kappa
receptors but not on mu receptors. 3. These findings corroborate
the possibility of interactions between calcitonin and the opioid
system. </p>

inflammation. </p>

<p>Source: J-Neurosci. 1995 Jan. 15(1 Pt 1). P 165-72. </p>

<p>Journal Title: JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE. </p>

<p>Abstract: Opioid receptors have been demonstrated on sensory
nerves in both inflamed and normal subcutaneous tissue but
locally applied opioid agonists produce analgesia in inflamed
tissue only. Inflammation confers a disruption of the perineurial
barrier that can also be induced deliberately by hyperosmolar
solutions. The present study examines at which stage of Freund's
adjuvant-induced inflammation peripheral opioid analgesic effects
become manifest and whether a perineurial defect contributes to
the appearance of such effects. To this end we have monitored the
temporal evolution of inflammatory signs (swelling, temperature,
hyperalgesia) and of peripheral antinociceptive effects (by the
paw pressure test) of mu-, delta-, and kappa-selective opioids.
Using horseradish peroxidase histochemistry, the perineurial
barrier was assessed in normal and inflamed tissue and following
its artificial disruption by hyperosmolar saline and mannitol in
vivo. Finally, we sought to elicit analgesia in normal tissue by
the concomitant application of mannitol and receptor-selective
opioids or by an extremely lipophilic opioid agonist (fentanyl).
We found that peripheral opioid antinociception and perineurial
leakage occur simultaneously at a very early stage (within 12 hr)
of the inflammatory reaction and that both can be mimicked by the
administration of hyperosmolar solutions in normal tissue.
Fentanyl produced peripheral antinociception in noninflamed
tissue that was potentiated by mannitol or inflammation. Our
findings demonstrate that the perineurium is a crucial
determinant for peripheral opioid analgesia and that the efficacy
of locally applied hydrophilic or lipophilic neuromodulatory
compounds can be improved dramatically by the concomitant
modulation of perineurial permeability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

<p>Abstract: Opiate and opioid analgesics are commonly used for
pain in general and presumably for headache. Codeine, oxycodone
and propoxyphene, among the most commonly prescribed, do carry
some risk of abuse, and their efficacy in headache patients has
not been well studied. In many patients with other kinds of pain,
however, both of neoplastic and non-neoplastic origin, chronic
opiate use has been demonstrated to be of benefit without adverse
side effects. The type of headache patient with intractable pain
who needs frequent opiate analgesic and who does not develop
addiction or drug abuse is an important subject for research. </p>

<p>Abstract: Hyperalgesia and allodynia in 4 cancer patients
treated with morphine disappeared after discontinuing or
substituting morphine with other opioid agonists. The first case
describes a young female who developed hyperalgesia and myoclonus
during intravenous morphine infusion. The hyperalgesia and
myoclonus disappeared when the morphine administration was
discontinued and she felt comfortable on small and sporadic oral
doses of methadone. The second case describes hyperalgesia
occurring after a small dose of sustained-release morphine which
disappeared after alternative use of oral ketobemidone. The third
case describes hyperalgesia following high doses of intramuscular
morphine which disappeared after alternative use of continuous
subcutaneous infusion of sufentanil. The fourth case describes a
boy developing hyperalgesia after high doses of oral and
intramuscular morphine. The hyperalgesia disappeared after
discontinuing morphine administration but withdrawal symptoms
developed due to too small doses of methadone. Possible
mechanisms of morphine-induced hyperalgesia are discussed. </p>

<p>Journal Title: PAIN. </p>

<p>Abstract: Prescribing long-term opioids for patients with
chronic pain is controversial. The primary purpose of this study
was to examine physicians' beliefs about and prescribing of the
long-term use of opioids in the treatment of chronic pain
patients. Concerns about regulatory pressure and appropriateness
of education regarding opioids were also examined. The design was
a stratified random sample. In the United States, 6962 physicians
were randomly selected from two states in each of five regions of
the country (Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, and
Pacific). Physicians from seven medical specialties (Family
Practice, Internal Medicine, Physical Medicine and
Rehabilitation, Rheumatology, Orthopedic Surgery, Neurosurgery,
and Neurology) were surveyed and 1912 (27.46%) responded. A
survey consisting of questions regarding years of practice,
number of chronic pain patients treated, frequency of prescribing
long-term opioids, concerns about opioids, goals of treatment,
beliefs about education regarding opioids, and concerns about
regulatory pressures was used. Based on the physicians who
responded, it appears that prescription of long-term opioids is
relatively wide-spread. Differences were noted by region,
specialty, and the requirement for the use of multiple
prescriptions for schedule II drugs. Physicians in the Midwestern
United States were the least likely to prescribe the long-term
use of opioids. Rheumatologists and general practitioners were
significantly more likely to prescribe long-term opioids than
were surgeons, neurologists, or physiatrists and were more likely
to emphasize the importance of symptom improvement as an
appropriate goal even in the absence of functional
improvements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </p>

<p>Abstract: Of the currently available mu agonist drugs, the
following are relatively contraindicated: 1.
Methadone--unpredictable duration of action [5]. 2.
Pethidine--unwanted central effects, metabolised to an active
metabolite and too short acting. 3. Codeine--too weak and with
constipating side-effects. 4. Fentanyl--too short acting. 5.
Oxycodone--too short acting although suppositories may overcome
some theoretical disadvantages. 6. Dextropropoxyphene--weak
agonist which is possibly metabolised to a cardiotoxic metabolite
[6]. Morphine remains the drug of choice for chronic pain when
administered in a sustained release preparation. MS Contin, a
slow release oral formulation of morphine, is available and has a
predictable duration of action lasting from 8-12 h, while
improved formulations are about to be released in the near future
in some countries. Prescribers need to take into account the
relatively poor oral bioavailability of morphine when calculating
the daily morphine dose. </p>

<p>Journal Title: FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL. </p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing importance of legal and ethical
questions in palliative medicine and euthanasia due to the
increased technical possibilities for extending life will be
considered. In palliative medicine, the choice of the best
therapy will be discussed, especially in the case of oncological
diseases. Here, consideration of the prospects of success, for
example, in chemotherapy, is faced with partly serious
side-effects. The requirements of palliative medicine that the
patient has to be fully informed of the fatal prognosis of his
disease is equally debated as the optimum pain therapy. In this
respect, the modification of the Narcotics Act of 1 February 1993
is also under discussion. In the field of euthanasia, the
technical development of life extension versus dying has raised
considerable legal and ethical problems regarding termination of
therapy. Additionally, fiscal considerations are of increasing
relevance. The common development of the legal and ethical
discussion, for example, with regard to the publicity of the work
of the so-called 'Gesellschaft fur humanes Sterben', the public
discussion leading up to a hearing of the 'Bundestag' regarding
active euthanasia leads to a realization of the subject. The
proposals for an active termination of life by discontinuing
therapy for adults and also for malformed newborns are discussed.
A dispute concerning the new legal regulation of active
euthanasia in the Netherlands of February 1993 is also discussed.
There, around 2% of all deaths per year result from active
termination of life and also cases where persons are not able to
consent. This also has enormous consequences for the position of
the physician.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </p>

<p>Journal Title: SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER. </p>

<p>Abstract: Over the past two decades, numerous trials have
assessed the safety and efficacy of patient-controlled analgesia
(PCA). Advantages over conventional parenteral narcotics reported
from these trials include equivalent to superior pain relief,
superior patient satisfaction, decreased sedation and anxiety,
faster return to normal functional status, and reduction in
nursing time and hospitalization. The majority of these trials
have been conducted in the postoperative patient population. In
the mid to late 1980s, interest arose in applying PCA technology
to the management of cancer pain. Factors that served as an
impetus for the use of PCA in cancer pain included favorable
reports from the postoperative setting and the often-cited
statistics regarding the magnitude of the cancer pain problem.
Advances in PCA technology coupled with advances in vascular
access technology that allow the placement of long-term ports and
catheters to facilitate intravenous, epidural, or intrathecal
administration of opioid analgesics have made the applicability
of PCA in ambulatory cancer patients an attractive option. The
greatest breakthrough in PCA technology came with the
introduction of devices making it possible to choose between
intermittent (demand bolus) and continuous administration
(continuous infusion) or both intermittent and continuous modes.
A comparison of these types of PCA devices is described. The
limitations of the literature involving PCA therapy in cancer
patients make it difficult to identify optimal patient selection
criteria, PCA administration schedules, drug selection and
dosing, and optimal route of administration. The current status
and pertinent issues related to these topics are addressed. </p>

<p>Abstract: Under-treatment of all types of pain has been
identified in many countries throughout the world. For example,
the World Health Organization states that unrelieved cancer pain
is an international problem. Lack of education of health care
professionals, including nurses, is frequently cited as a major
reason for under-treatment of pain. This survey of 517 Australian
nurses suggests that they have some of the same educational needs
as nurses in North America, such as how to assess pain intensity
and how to select a dose of an opioid analgesic that is
appropriate for the individual patient. </p>

spinal opioids on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated events. </p>

<p>Source: Anesthesiology. 1994 Dec. 81(6). P 1429-35. </p>

<p>Journal Title: ANESTHESIOLOGY. </p>

<p>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor- mediated mechanisms may contribute to reduced opioid
sensitivity in conditions of pain. The effectiveness of spinal
opioids in inhibiting NMDA-mediated nociceptive events was
assessed with two models. In addition, opioid dose-response
curves with preemptive administration were compared with early
and late postadministrations. METHODS: Dorsal horn nociceptive
neuronal responses were recorded in the intact halothane
anesthetized rat to acute repetitive C-fiber electrical
stimulation (0.1 and 0.5 Hz) and to the peripheral injection of
5% formalin. At 0.5 Hz but not at 0.1 Hz, there was an enhanced
C-fiber evoked response of dorsal horn neurons elicited by
repetitive C-fiber stimulation (wind-up), which is mediated by
the NMDA receptor. Formalin produced a biphasic response; the
late protracted inflammatory phase was NMDA receptor-mediated.
RESULTS: With 0.5-Hz stimulation a large degree of wind-up was
elicited; it was less sensitive to 5 micrograms morphine compared
with the effect of the same dose on the residual wind- up
elicited at 0.1 Hz. Preadministration and early
postadministration of morphine were equieffective at inhibiting
the second-phase formalin response. In contrast, administration
of the fast-acting mu opioid, D-Ala-Gly-MePHe-Gly-ol, given late
postadministration (during the second phase) was less effective
than preadministration. Increasing the dose of D-Ala-
Gly-MePHe-Gly-ol produced complete inhibitions. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS: NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal responses, such
as wind-up and the established second phase of the formalin
response, are poorly responsive to opioids. Dose increases and
preemptive opioids effectively inhibit these NMDA
receptor-mediated events. </p>

patients chronically treated with morphine: a preliminary report.
</p>

<p>Source: Pain. 1994 Jul. 58(1). P 129-32. </p>

<p>Journal Title: PAIN. </p>

<p>Abstract: The ability of nimodipine, a calcium-channel
blocker, to enhance morphine analgesia and/or modify the
development of tolerance was studied in patients with cancer pain
who had needed successive increments of morphine for periods
ranging from 21 to 780 days. Assessment of daily morphine
consumption was the primary effect parameter. Nimodipine
succeeded in reducing the daily dose of morphine in 16 of 23
patients (oral, n = 13; intrathecal, n = 3), and failed to modify
it in 2 patients. Total oral daily dose was reduced by nimodipine
(120 mg/day) from 282.6 +/- 47.7 mg to 158.7 +/- 26.2 mg (n = 15,
P &lt; 0.001). Intrathecal morphine was also reduced by 1-5
mg/day. Nimodipine was withdrawn in 5 patients during the first
week of treatment due to intolerance (n = 3) or aggravation of
the disease (n = 2). These preliminary results support
experimental findings showing that pharmacological interference
with Ca(2+)-related events may modify chronic opioid effects,
including the expression of tolerance. </p>

<p>Abstract: The objective of this study was to assess the
effectiveness of a previously described technique of regional
analgesia (continuous infusion of local anesthetic through a
catheter placed at the time of amputation within the exposed
sciatic or posterior tibial nerve) on relieving the postoperative
pain in a heterogeneous group of patients who underwent lower
extremity amputations. A second objective was to determine the
effect of such treatment on the incidence and characteristics of
phantom limb pain 6 months or more after surgery in the same
patients. The study design was retrospective, unblinded,
controlled (postoperative pain), and unblinded questionnaire and
interview (phantom pain) were utilized. Subjects were inpatients
at Harborview Medical Center, University of Washington, Seattle,
WA. Nineteen bupivacaine-treated and 40 nonbupivacaine-treated
patients who underwent lower extremity amputation subsequent to
trauma, infection, long-standing injury (poor or no function),
congenital deformity, or burns were evaluated in the
postoperative pain management assessment. Nine treated and 12
untreated patients were interviewed in the phantom pain
assessment. Bupivacaine 0.5% 2-6 ml/h was infused through a
polyamide 20-gauge catheter inserted into the sciatic or
posterior tibial nerve sheath under direct vision at the time of
surgery. All patients, treated and control, received opioid
analgesics systemically during the 72-hour period of study. The
postoperative opioid analgesic requirement of treated patients
was compared with that of control patients who received opioid
analgesics alone. A questionnaire was administered to assess
presence, severity, and character of phantom pain.(ABSTRACT

<p>Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess pharmacists' knowledge,
attitudes, and beliefs regarding the use of narcotics in cancer
pain management, identify pharmacist counseling activities for
cancer pain patients, assess pharmacy- related barriers to cancer
pain management, and evaluate the availability of narcotic
analgesics. METHODS: Mailing of a six-page survey. SETTING: Five
hundred randomly selected pharmacists registered in North
Carolina. PARTICIPANTS: Of 500 pharmacists surveyed, 141 surveys
were completed and returned for a response rate of 28.2 percent.
RESULTS: Pharmacists surveyed were knowledgeable regarding the
problem of undertreatment of cancer pain. More than 80 percent of
respondents replied that most cancer patients experience pain at
some time during their illness. Eighty-five percent of
respondents agreed that the nurse must believe the patient's
report of pain and that the patient is the best judge of the
intensity of the pain. Conservative physician prescribing
patterns and conservative administration patterns of nurses were
identified as perceived barriers to adequate pain management by
51 and 44 percent of respondents, respectively. Less than 30
percent of respondents frequently counseled cancer pain patients
and were unable to identify patients who have cancer pain as a
major medical illness. Hospital pharmacists recommended
adjunctive therapy more often than did community pharmacists (p =
0.013). Interventions in pain management regimens were more often
conducted by hospital pharmacists than by community pharmacists
(p = 0.049). Differences in availability of narcotics was noted
among practice sites for some more potent narcotics. Of the
pharmacists surveyed, only 43 percent had attended a continuing
education program on cancer pain management. Ninety-six percent
of respondents were interested in attending a continuing
education program in the future. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists in North Carolina are aware that the
undertreatment of cancer pain is a serious medical problem.
Unfortunately, pharmacists appear to be unable to identify
patients with cancer pain as a major medical problem; therefore,
counseling activity is limited. Addiction is still perceived as a
barrier by some pharmacists. Through organizations such as the
North Carolina Pain Initiative, these problems can be addressed. </p>

<p>Journal Title: REGIONAL ANESTHESIA. </p>

<p>Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES. Opioids have been
accepted as appropriate treatment for acute and cancer pain, but
remain controversial for use with chronic nonmalignant pain.
Clinicians are concerned about efficacy, tolerance, addiction,
and unwanted side effects. METHODS. The aim of this study was to
survey chronic pain patients who were taking opioids for their
pain, to determine the incidence of these adverse conditions. Two
hundred seventeen patients who were being treated for their pain
at two different pain centers completed a medication
questionnaire. The most common diagnosis was low back pain. One
hundred twelve patients reported taking oral opioids for their
pain. RESULTS. Of the patients who reported taking opioids for
their chronic pain, 83% felt that the opioids were moderately
beneficial in relieving their pain; 25% felt that the opioid had
not lost its ability to relieve the pain over time; 35% reported
that they did not need to increase their medication; 36%
expressed no fear of addiction or dependence; and 56% reported
having no unwanted side effects. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS. The results suggest that chronic nonmalignant
pain patients taking opioids for their pain reported some
tolerance, fear of addiction, and side effects when taking
opioids. However, despite these concerns, some of these patients
felt that opioid therapy was very beneficial. Further
investigations are needed to determine which patient
characteristics predict benefit from opioid therapy for
nonmalignant pain. </p>

<p>Abstract: A high performance, active duty fitness requirement
group rehabilitated equally to a low performance needs civilian
group, both suffering from disabling chronic pain. The purpose of
this prospective study was to determine whether higher physical
performance requirements adversely affected outcome in a chronic
pain rehabilitation program. Twenty-three active duty, chronic
pain patients were treated along with 22 civilian chronic pain
sufferers in a behavior modification, including positive, verbal
reinforcement for performance, stress management and family
counseling, physical reconditioning, including stretching,
strengthening and aerobic conditioning in a slowly progressive
fashion to required needs, and narcotic and muscle relaxant
detoxification program at a major military medical center.
Eighteen patients in each group, representing, respectively, 78
and 82% of the military and civilian participants, successfully
completed the inpatient program. Success was defined by (1)
elimination of all narcotics and minor tranquilizers, (2)
elimination of all physical restrictions that precluded any
desired work or play, which required much higher levels for the

physical profile restrictions and (4) objectively passing annual
aerobics field test requirements before the program's end. Review
of military disability separation records, averaging 24 mo

<p>Title: Potentiation of the analgesic properties of
fentanyl-like opioids with alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists in rats.

<p>Journal Title: ANESTHESIOLOGY. </p>

<p>Abstract: BACKGROUND: Data on the analgesic properties of
alpha 2 agonists and their interactions with opioids are
conflicting. Experiments were conducted in rats to evaluate
whether various available alpha 2 agonists can potentiate the
analgesic properties of opioids and to determine the route of
administration needed for optimal interaction. METHODS: The
tail-withdrawal reaction test was used as an analgesia assay. In
separate experiments, the interactions between systemic
(subcutaneous, intravenous, and intraperitoneal) and spinally
(epidural and intrathecal) administered alpha 2 agonists and
opioids were evaluated. The antagonism of medetomidine plus
fentanyl with naloxone and/or idazoxan also was studied. RESULTS:
All alpha 2 agonists tested, when injected subcutaneously with
fentanyl, potentiated the opioid-induced analgesia. In terms of a
reduction of the amount of fentanyl needed to produce a deep
surgical analgesia (tail-withdrawal reaction latency &gt; or = 10
s) over more than 2 h, the relative order of potency of the alpha
2 agonists tested was: medetomidine &gt; dexmedetomidine &gt;
xylazine &gt; clonidine &gt; detomidine. For some of these alpha
2 agonists there was a biphasic effect: at the larger doses
tested, a reduction in the fentanyl potentiation was present. The
potentiation of the opioid activity with alpha 2 agonists was
also demonstrated in terms of a longer duration of analgesia
after combined treatment with fixed doses of opioids. The
interaction between the alpha 2 agonists and the opioids remained
present when a more profound criterion of analgesia
(tail-withdrawal reaction latency &gt; or = 30 s) was used.
Furthermore, the interactions between the alpha 2 agonists tested
and fentanyl or sufentanil appeared to be independent of the
route of administration. Potentiations were observed after
simultaneous subcutaneous injections of both groups of compounds,
after the combination of intraperitoneal (alpha 2 agonist) plus
subcutaneous (opioid), intravenous (alpha 2 agonist) plus
epidural (opioid) and simultaneous epidural or intrathecal
administrations. With regard to antagonism of the analgesic
activity of combined treatment with alpha 2 agonists plus
opioids, naloxone provided total antagonism, whereas the alpha 2
antagonist idazoxan overcame only the alpha 2 agonist-induced
potentiation of fentanyl. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS: The tested alpha 2 agonists can potentiate the
analgesic properties of opioids, but they have no intrinsic
antinociceptive effects on spinal reflexes on their own. The
potentiating activities of the alpha 2 agonists could be measured
both in terms of a reduction of the amount of opioid needed to
reach a particular level of analgesia and in terms of a longer
duration of analgesia with a fixed dose of the opioid. The
potentiations were observed with various alpha 2 agonists and
opioids and appeared independent of the routes of administration.

<p>Abstract: A questionnaire was sent to the pharmacies of 88
Finish hospitals with surgical departments to inquire about the
consumption of opioids during 1990. Another questionnaire was
sent to 480 members of the Finnish Society of Anaesthesiologists
to ask how they administer opioids to adult patients. Answers
were received from 95% of hospitals and 67% of anaesthetists.
Dextropropoxyphene was the most common oral opioid and oxycodone
was the most common parenteral opioid used in Finland. Parenteral
opioids were consumed almost totally in the hospitals. The
anaesthetists reported oxycodone to be the opioid of choice for
premedication, postoperative pain and sedation of critically ill
patients. Fentanyl was the opioid most commonly used
intravenously during balanced anaesthesia and in epidural
administration. Epidural opioids were administered by 77% of
anaesthetists and patient- controlled analgesia (PCA) technique
mostly for intravenous administration by 19%. Only 10% of Finnish
anaesthetists were actively involved in the management of chronic
pain; the methods they use are discussed. The majority of
anaesthetists were satisfied with the currently available
opioids. </p>

<p>Abstract: Opioid sensitivity, residual pain, development of
tolerance, physical and psychological dependence are described
and discussed in relation to long-term opioid therapy. Based on
this, guidelines for long-term opioid administration are
established for chronic pain conditions of non-cancer origin. The
indication must be well-considered--a life-long treatment may be
instituted. Prior to final initiation of the treatment, a testing
of the selected drug and method of administration should be
performed. Due to the compliance- reasons, only long acting
opioids should be used (controlled release morphine preparations,
methadone, buprenorphine) and the route of administration should
always be oral. The treatment must be individualised, covering 24
hours a day. The single dosages should be identical and
administered with identical time intervals, which are determined
by the duration of action of the drug in use.
P.r.n.-administration should not be allowed. Only one physician
should be responsible for the treatment and for the prescription
of the opioid analgesic drugs. </p>

<p>Journal Title: AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL PHARMACY. </p>

<p>Abstract: Physiological responses to acute pain are described,
and the effects of different analgesic techniques on these
responses are discussed. The body's response to acute pain can
cause adverse physiological effects. Pain can impede the return
of normal pulmonary function, modify certain aspects of the
stress response to injury, and alter hemodynamic values and
cardiovascular function. It can produce immobility and contribute
to thromboembolic complications. In addition, pain can slow a
patient's recovery from surgery and contribute to increased
morbidity. Fewer pulmonary complications occur when adequate
analgesia is provided through the use of epidural narcotics and
local anesthetics, particularly if the injury or surgery involves
the lower part of the body. Continuous morphine infusions,
intercostal nerve blocks, and transcutaneous electrical
stimulation do not alter the frequency of pulmonary
complications. The effectiveness of patient-controlled analgesia
in reducing postoperative pulmonary complications is still not
known. Epidural local anesthetic therapy inhibits the stress
response, particularly in operations involving the lower abdomen
or extremities; this technique is less effective during major
abdominal procedures. Suppression of endocrine-metabolic changes
following lower abdominal surgery requires neural block to the
fourth thoracic segment. Epidural narcotics partially inhibit the
stress response after lower abdominal or extremity surgery but
not after upper abdominal or thoracic surgery. Local anesthetics
applied to the surgical site, intercostal nerve blocks, and
intrapleural and intraperitoneal administration also do not
modify the stress response. Adequate analgesia through the use of
local anesthetics and narcotics postoperatively generally results
in improved cardiovascular function, decreased pulmonary
morbidity and mortality, earlier ambulation, and decreased
likelihood of deep vein thrombosis. Some data suggest that
improved patient outcome occurs with adequate analgesia. Block of
afferent and efferent neural pathways by local anesthetics seems
to be the most effective analgesic modality in lessening the
physiologic response to pain and injury. </p>

<p>Abstract: In the evaluation of Chinese herbs (A),
ear-acupuncture (B) and epidural morphine (C) to relieve
postoperative pain and abdominal distension, sixteen male
patients with primary liver cancer were observed. This study was
conducted by means of orthogonal experiment and double blind,
randomized design. The patients received various treatments
according to the display of the orthogonal table L16(2)15 which
corresponds to 2(3) factorial experiment design. C+ (morphine 2
mg) was given before the peritoneum was sutured. A+ (orally
administered) and B+ were given 24 hours after operation. 50-100
mg of pethidine was given when the pain intensity VAS (0-100)
exceeded 50-70. The observation parameters included plasma
leucine enkephalin (LEK), postoperative total dosage of narcotics
administered for 5 days, VAS for pain and pain reliever,
abdominal distension, urinary retention, constipation, etc. The
results were as follows: a. Patients who had received A (A+B+C+,
A+B+C-, A+B-C-, A+B-C+); C (C+A+B+, C+A+B-, C+A-B+, C+A-B-), or B
(B+A+C+, B+A+C-, B+A-C+, B+A-C-) produced better analgesic
effects than those who had received placebo. The A, B, and C
reduced narcotics 650, 450 and 550 mg respectively when compared
with placebo. The effects of A and C were of statistical
significance (P &lt; 0.05), while AB, BC, and AC interactions
were not found; b. A and B minimized abdominal distension and
urinary retention, while C prolonged them. As compared with the
placebo, A and B accelerated restoration of bowel peristalsis (P
&lt; 0.05, ANOVA). Both A and B decreased it for 165 hours, while
epidural morphine prolonged it for 49 hours; and c.(ABSTRACT

<p>Journal Title: ANNALS OF THE ACADEMY OF MEDICINE, SINGAPORE. </p>

<p>Abstract: For most patients with cancer pain, the primary goal
of opioid pharmacotherapy is a satisfactory balance between
analgesia and side effects. Consequently, the assessment and
treatment of opioid side effects is a fundamental aspect of
therapy, which may increase the likelihood of a favourable
treatment outcome, potentially allow higher and more efficacious
opioid doses, and improve quality of life by reducing other
uncomfortable symptoms. This review describes the presentation,
assessment and management of adverse neuropsychological and
gastrointestinal effects due to opioid drugs. These common side
effects pose the major challenge for the clinician who undertakes
the long-term opioid therapy of patients with cancer pain. </p>

<p>Journal Title: CLINICAL JOURNAL OF PAIN. </p>

<p>Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The provision of acute pain management
for the chronic pain patient can pose a challenge. We sought to
characterize management issues. SUBJECTS/SETTING: An anonymous
survey was distributed to 270 physicians and 212 nurses at
University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) in an attempt to
characterize management issues. DESIGN: Caregivers were queried
regarding treatment modalities, efficacy of anxiolysis, patient
attributes, concern of the quantity of medication, criteria for
patient evaluation, and other management issues. RESULTS: Of the
respondents, 61.8% were physicians, and 38.2% were nurses. The
mean duration in practice was 7.7 years. The responses from the
two groups were similar. Seventy-five percent reported using
different pain-evaluation techniques for chronic pain patients
than those utilized for the &quot;average&quot; patient. Pain
scores were used frequently in the average patient, whereas
ability to perform activities was used more commonly in the
chronic pain patient (p &lt; 0.0001). Half of the respondents
expressed concern regarding the amount of medication used and
level of sedation. The same proportion found anxiolysis to be a
helpful adjunct. The use of a time- contingent &quot;pain
cocktail&quot; as an oral medication was a useful strategy for
88% of respondents. The least labor- intensive modality reported
was patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for 84.5% of respondents;
intravenous opiate fusion, 5.3%; and epidural analgesia, 11.2%. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS: The survey describes caregiver concerns regarding
this patient population, including medication use, sedation,
length of hospital stay, and evaluation techniques. </p>

<p>Source: Aust-Fam-Physician. 1994 Jul. 23(7). P 1279-83. </p>

<p>Journal Title: AUSTRALIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN. </p>

<p>Abstract: Neuropathic pain is often a reason for an
unfavourable response to morphine or other opioids in treating
cancer pain. This type of pain is difficult to manage and may
co-exist with nociceptive cancer pain. There is still a potential
for opioid responsiveness, although the doses needed will be
higher, and adjuvant drug therapies are best employed
concurrently with opioid drugs. Adjuvant drugs used are the
antidepressants, anticonvulsants, including benzodiazepines,
corticosteroids and neurolepts. Less commonly, agents such as
baclofen and clonidine, and sympatholytic drugs such as prazosin
can be employed for sympathetically maintained neuropathic pain
(discussed in Part 3). The type of agent selected will depend on
the natural history of the disease process, as well as a
description of the pain-- the lancinating pains tending to
respond better to anticonvulsants. Non invasive neurostimulatory
approaches such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(TENS) may be useful in management, and a few patients may
require an invasive procedure such as dorsal column stimulation. </p>

<p>Source: Am-J-Emerg-Med. 1994 Jul. 12(4). P 469-71. </p>

<p>Journal Title: AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE. </p>

<p>Abstract: A prospective, open-label study of the effectiveness
of transnasal butorphanol in the treatment of pain resulting from
musculoskeletal injuries. Twenty-eight patients with strains (n =
20), fractures (n = 6), contusions (n = 1), and stab wounds (n =
1) were included. All patients were examined by an attending
level emergency medicine physician and deemed to have pain severe
enough to warrant parenteral narcotic analgesia. All patients
received an initial 1-mg dose of transnasal butorphanol.
Subsequent dosing was flexible depending on response to the
initial dose. All patients received pain relief from transnasal
butorphanol, and only one requested alternative analgesic
medication. Fifty- seven percent (n = 16) of patients noticed at
least a little relief of pain within 5 minutes of administration
and 93% (n = 26) received at least a little relief within 15
minutes. Seventy-one percent of the patients received a 50%
reduction of pain within 60 minutes. No serious side effects were
noted, but drowsiness occurred in 82% (n = 23) and dizziness in
54% (n = 15) of the patients. One patient discontinued
participation in the study because of nausea. In this limited
trial transnasal butorphanol proved to be a rapidly effective
opioid analgesic. Further controlled studies comparing transnasal
butorphanol with standard parenteral narcotics are needed. </p>

of patient-controlled reduction and staff controlled cocktail
methods. </p>

<p>Source: Pain. 1994 Mar. 56(3). P 279-88. </p>

<p>Journal Title: PAIN. </p>

<p>Abstract: This study compares the effectiveness of two methods
of opiate reduction in 108 chronic pain patients during a 4 week
inpatient pain management programme, and at 1-month and 6-month
follow-up. Patients chose either the patient-controlled reduction
(PCR) or cocktail reduction method, aiming to complete withdrawal
by discharge. Use of opiates and other drugs was recorded, and
psychological measures taken, at admission, at discharge, and at
follow-ups. Patients who opted for the cocktail reduction method
started at higher morphine equivalents (P &lt; 0.001), were less
confident in their ability to cope without medication (P &lt;
0.05), and rated their everyday activities a more disrupted by
pain (P &lt; 0.05). At discharge, 89% of the cocktail group were
abstinent from opiates compared with 68% of the PCR group (P &lt;
0.05). By 1- month follow-up, the advantage of the cocktail
method had disappeared, with no significant differences between
the two groups in mean opiate dose, nor in the proportion of
abstinent patients. This was the result of a greater return to
opiate use in the cocktail group, with abstinence rates remaining
unchanged in the PCR group. By 6-month follow-up, abstinence
rates for the groups were equivalent, with 55% of patients
remaining off opiates. By this stage, however, non-abstinent
cocktail group patients were taking significantly larger doses of
opiates than PCR patients (P &lt; 0.05), although in both groups,
the dose was well below admission level. Admission opiate dose
level was the best predictor both of abstinence at discharge and
of subsequent opiate dose level in non-abstinent patients. This
study demonstrates that both reduction methods can produce
substantial reduction in opiate use by severely impaired chronic
pain patients with long medication histories. </p>

<p>Journal Title: NEUROLOGY. </p>

<p>Abstract: The question of the appropriate use of opiate
analgesics in the management of chronic headache pain is under
debate. Often, the management of headache pain is complicated by
the overuse of dependency-promoting analgesics. Because of
confusion about the use of analgesics in pain management, some
patients are denied access to necessary opioid analgesia, whereas
others receive large quantities of combination analgesics. The
proper use of opiate analgesics is presented here, including a
review of the pharmacology of these agents. Signs of analgesic
dependence, analgesic rebound headache, and methods of withdrawal
are also presented. The potential use of such new treatment
modalities as butorphanol nasal spray is discussed. </p>

<p>Journal Title: NEUROSCIENCE. </p>

<p>Abstract: Changes in chemical sensitivity of peripheral
nociceptors following injury or inflammation have been studied in
in vitro preparation of the saphenous nerve-hind paw skin from
adult rats. Heat hyperalgesia in the hind paw was induced by a
prior ultraviolet irradiation and the skin from these animals was
investigated five days later. Polymodal nociceptors were
quiescent in normal skin but were spontaneously active in the
majority of fibres after ultraviolet exposure. Capsaicin- induced
activation of fine fibres was enhanced after ultraviolet
pretreatment. Direct administration of morphine, DAGOL
(mu-receptor agonist) and U-69593 (kappa-receptor agonist), but
not DPDPE (delta-receptor agonist) to the receptive field
produced a concentration-related and naloxone- reversible
suppression of spontaneous firing in polymodal nociceptors of
ultraviolet-treated skin. Morphine did not reduce the activity of
fibres in normal skin when these were driven by KCl
depolarization. These data show that polymodal nociceptors change
their activity and sensitivity to exogenous chemicals following
the induction of peripheral hyperalgesia by ultraviolet
irradiation. Specifically, evidence is provided for the
expression of opioid sensitivity and inhibition of polymodal
nociceptor activity through mu- and kappa-opioid receptors. These
observations may account for peripheral antinociceptive actions
of opioids during specific states of peripheral hyperalgesia. </p>

<p>Abstract: Thirty-three patients previously treated for a
variety of chronic pain syndromes (largely non-surgical back
problems) were selected for study on the basis of 2 years or
greater post-discharge status. A patient profile was developed
revealing an 86% successful return-to-work rate and minimal use
of narcotics 4 years after discharge. In addition, there was
relatively low use of either inpatient or outpatient medical
services after treatment. These patient behaviors were specific
goals of the pain management program in which these patients had
participated. Interesting data were also collected on medication
use after treatment and methods of pain control used most
successfully. Selected outcome variables were also studied across
specific diagnostic categories (surgical v non-surgical back
problems, amputee pain, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and others)
for this group. In general, rather compelling positive outcomes
are shown for the long-term effects of multi-disciplinary pain
management. </p>

<p>Journal Title: BRAIN RESEARCH. </p>

<p>Abstract: Our laboratory and others have previously reported
that the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
antagonist, MK-801, interferes with the development of tolerance
to the analgesic effects of morphine. The present studies were
performed in order to further characterize the role of NMDA
receptors in opiate tolerance. The results demonstrate that
opiate tolerance is inhibited rapidly, and at low doses, by four
different non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists (MK-801,
ketamine, dextrorphan and phencyclidine), suggesting that this
inhibition results from blockade of NMDA receptors rather than
from the 'side-effect' of a particular drug. The NMDA antagonists
were found to inhibit the development but not the expression of
opiate tolerance; i.e. they were able to prevent but not reverse
tolerance. Finally, the results suggest that NMDA receptor
antagonists do not interfere with associative tolerance; instead
it appears that these drugs may specifically inhibit
non-associative tolerance. It thus appears that NMDA receptors
may have a fundamental role in the development of opiate
tolerance, and that non- competitive NMDA receptor antagonists
may be effective adjuncts to opiates in the treatment of chronic
pain. </p>

<p>Abstract: In summary, RSD is pain of neuropathic origin. The
diagnosis is often obscure and requires a complete history,
physical, and psychological evaluations. The diagnosis depends on
symptoms (burning pain, allodynia and hyperpathia); signs (edema,
sudomotor changes, temperature changes); and objective
measurements, such as skin temperature, QSART, radiographs, and
triple-phase bone scans; as well as the clinical response to a
sympathetic block. Management of RSD should be designed to
promote restoration of function utilizing physical therapy made
possible by sympathetic, central, or peripheral nerve blockade.
Medications may include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
tricyclic antidepressants, and vasoactive drugs. Psychologic
support is an important part of the patient's rehabilitation.
Dorsal column or peripheral nerve stimulators, sympathectomies,
and narcotics should be considered only when other more
conservative measures have failed. </p>

<p>Abstract: When surgery is planned, postoperative pain
management requires careful consideration. Many medications and
techniques can greatly reduce a patient's postsurgical
discomfort, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
long-acting local anesthetics, corticosteroids, narcotics, ice,
and compression. Pain management should begin preoperatively,
continue through surgery, and be fully managed postoperatively.
Successful management of postoperative pain greatly affects
patients' overall impressions of their surgery. </p>

<p>Abstract: Cerebral dysfunction due to long-term treatment with
opioids is a problem of increasing relevance because of the
rapidly growing use of opioids. A review of psychomotor and
cognitive test methods is given, including their application in
patients on long-term opioid treatment. The findings of the most
valid studies on cancer patients in long-term treatment with
opioids are an increase in continuous reaction time and
subjective sedation score regardless of the routes of
administration. Studies of drug addicts in long-term treatment
with opioids seem to reflect a lowering of the general level of
activity. According to recent studies, patients with chronic non-
malignant pain conditions are responsible for the major part of
the total opioid consumption. So far, no studies of cerebral
dysfunction have been performed on this group of patients.
Further research should concentrate on the use of few valid
psychomotor and cognitive tests and should include patients with
chronic non-malignant pain conditions. </p>

<p>Abstract: Addiction medicine specialists, besieged with the
adverse consequences of opioids, not unreasonably develop
reservations about their use. Opioid prohibition may be
appropriate when working with addicts, but drug abstinence is not
always the most appropriate nor optimal treatment of pain
patients. Consultation concerning the management of chronic pain
patients may require an attitude adjustment of challenging
proportions for the addiction medicine specialist; it is a role
substantially different from that usually assumed in treating
alcohol- and drug-dependent patients. Rather than relentlessly
pursuing psychotropic drug abstinence as the treatment goal,
restoration of function should be the primary treatment goal for
the chronic pain patient. Unlike the chemically dependent patient
whose level of function is impaired by substance use, the chronic
pain patient's level of function may improve with adequate,
judicious use of medications, which may include opioids.
Evaluating for addiction in a patient who is prescribed long-term
opioids for pain control is often problematic. While the concept
of addiction may include the symptoms of physical dependence and
tolerance, physical dependence and/or tolerance alone does not
equate with addiction. In the chronic pain patient taking
long-term opioids, physical dependence and tolerance should be
expected, but the maladaptive behavior changes associated with
addiction are not expected. Thus, it is the presence of these
behaviors in the chronic pain patient that is far more important
in diagnosing addiction. </p>

analgesic efficacy of intrathecal opioid with or without

<p>Journal Title: JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT. </p>

<p>Abstract: We report on the analgesic efficacy of intrathecal
infusions of opioids alone or in combination with bupivacaine in
16 nonmalignant pain patients with implanted pumps. Three
patients had nociceptive pain, five had neuropathic pain, and 8
had mixed pain syndromes. Infusional therapy was delivered over a
combined monthly total of 445 mo of therapy (mean, 27.8 mo). Dose
requirements appeared to be stable with a mean dose increase of
0.26 mg/mo. Bupivacaine was added to the opioid to enhance pain
control in 13 patients who received combination therapy for an
average of 11.7 mo/patient. Thirteen patients (81%) reported good
to excellent results with opioid alone or opioid combined with
bupivacaine. The addition of bupivacaine improved analgesia in
two of three patients with nociceptive pain (66.7%), compared to
eight of ten patients with a pure or mixed neuropathic component
to their pain (80%). We conclude that intrathecal opioids alone
or in combination with bupivacaine are efficacious for the
treatment of nonmalignant pain states and are relatively free of
significant side effects or tolerance. </p>

<p>Abstract: As the United States continues its &quot;War on
Drugs,&quot; physicians who prescribe opioids for the purpose of
pain control must recognize that legal issues are an important
part of the prescription process. Physicians who do not correctly
prescribe opioids may mark their patients as drug abusers and
themselves as misprescribers. Efforts are under way to
characterize appropriately the conditions under which opioids
should be prescribed for the management of pain. California and
Texas have passed intractable pain laws, which permit the
prescribing of opioid medication for chronic pain patients. These
laws were necessary because claims were made against prescribers
who legitimately administered opioids to chronic pain patients.
Physicians must be aware that once a patient has been diagnosed
an addict, it is not legal to prescribe opioids for the purpose
of maintaining or detoxifying that patient; treatment of pain is
still permissible, however. It is clear that new standards of
care must be developed to reduce the liability of legitimate
prescribers from sanctions in either criminal or civil settings.
With new standards of care, prescriptions for opioids written in
good faith for the treatment of pain should survive legal
scrutiny. </p>

<p>Abstract: Addiction medicine specialists and pain specialists
can provide better patient care by combining their expertise when
treating patients who are addicted to alcohol, street drugs, or
prescription medications. Addiction specialists--particularly
those whose primary treatment philosophy is drug free--must
accept that controlled opiate maintenance is appropriate for some
patients, and pain specialists need to increase their sensitivity
to the possibility of addiction among their patients. Both pain
and addiction are treatable conditions, and optimal care of some
patients requires the coordinated services of both an addiction
medicine specialist and a pain specialist. </p>

<p>Journal Title: JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT. </p>

<p>Abstract: The use of long-term opioids (LTOs) to treat chronic
pain of nonmalignant origin (CNMP) is controversial. Most
physicians had felt there was essentially no role for LTOs in
CNMP, but successful treatment outcomes have recently been
reported. Tolerance, organ toxicity, or fear of addiction are not
reasons to limit LTOs. The significant question is efficacy. Does
LTO therapy improve pain and increase function with minimal side
effects or risk? It is useful to divide chronic pain patients
into three types. Type 1 patients are &quot;typical&quot; chronic
pain patients with pain and disability far out of proportion to
the peripheral stimulus. Psychological factors are significant.
In this type of patient, opioids appear to do more harm than
good. Type 2 patients have ongoing nociception and moderate
refractory pain. Type 3 patients have refractory severe
nociception or neuropathic pain. The latter types might be
considered for LTOs. LTO use is appropriate for a very small,
carefully selected group of patients. </p>

<p>Journal Title: REGIONAL ANESTHESIA. </p>

<p>Abstract: OBJECTIVE. Two pain treatment systems that developed
soon after the publication of the gate theory are probably a
direct result of its publication: neuraxial opiate administration
and electrical stimulation of the spinal cord and peripheral
nerves and receptors. Although the use of these modalities has
become widespread in managing chronic pain, there is disagreement
about their long-term efficacy. This presentation will attempt to
review the data regarding the mechanisms of action of these
modalities and their efficacy in treating chronic pain of
malignant and nonmalignant origin. DATA SOURCES. Data were
derived almost entirely from original articles reporting
experimental data from both animal and human studies and from
series of patients undergoing treatment with the modalities
reviewed. STUDY SELECTION. Where possible, controlled studies
were selected. However, much of the available data regarding
treatment results are uncontrolled. DATA EXTRACTION AND
SYNTHESIS. Selected data from studies that were felt to be
reasonably well conducted are presented or summarized. Because of
the lack of control groups in many of the clinical trials,
meta-analyses were not carried out. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS. Long-term spinal opiate administration has been
shown to be more effective than systemic opiates in some patients
with cancer pain, but often must be combined with local
anesthetics to provide satisfactory pain relief. Loss of effect
over time is a significant problem. Since the identification of
spinal opiate receptors and the introduction of spinally
administered narcotics, a number of other receptors that are
important in both sensitization and suppression of pain
projection systems have been characterized. Agonists and
antagonists to many of these receptors are being developed, and a
few are available for clinical trials. Long-term electrical
stimulation of the spinal cord produces substantial analgesia
below the stimulated spinal segments in some patients with
chronic pain. Although initial results are usually encouraging,
long-term efficacy may be disappointing. It is postulated that
analgesia associated with spinal stimulation is associated with
both stimulation of large fiber ascending tracts and blockade of
spinothalamic pathways. Transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation (TENS) has come into widespread use in managing
chronic pain and has had limited trials in cancer pain patients.
It is well accepted by patients and physicians, but clinical
studies of long-term efficacy have yielded variable results. The
analgesic action is probably the result of both large afferent
fiber activation and blockade of peripheral nociceptors. </p>

<p>Abstract: Neurogenic pain (encompassing all types of
neuropathic and central pain) is discussed. Experimental work is
presented in a model in which the rat sciatic nerve is loosely
ligatured. In painful human neuropathies, tricyclic
antidepressants have been found to be effective in proportion to
the degree they facilitate monoaminergic activity. Several papers
also stress the importance of early treatment with amitriptyline
or desipramine, and the ineffectiveness of analgesics, including
narcotics. In nociceptive pain, recent findings in humans
emphasize the importance of both the retroinsular (SII) and the
anterior cingulate cortices in the conscious appreciation of
pain. Opioid studies have revealed individual differences in the
metabolism of morphine to its 3- and 6-glucuronosides; patients
with nociceptive pain who respond poorly to morphine or
diamorphine probably have a high 3:6 ratio. It has been pointed
out that methadone may be useful in such cases, as it is not
broken down to glucuronosides. </p>

<p>Journal Title: BRAIN RESEARCH. </p>

<p>Abstract: Intravenous (i.v.) administration of morphine
produces a dose- dependent inhibition of the tail-flick (TF)
reflex, depressor response, and bradycardia in the rat. Some of
these effects depend on interactions of i.v. morphine with
peripheral opioid receptors and the integrity of cervical vagal
afferents. The present studies used the relatively specific mu,
delta, and kappa opioid receptor agonists (DAGO, DPDPE or
U-50,488H) and the relatively specific mu, delta, and kappa
opioid receptor antagonists (beta-FNA, naloxonazine, naltrindole
or nor-BNI) in either intact rats or rats with bilateral cervical
vagotomy (CVAG) to delineate the vagal afferent/opioid-mediated
components of these effects. I.v. administration of DAGO in
intact rats produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the TF
reflex, depressor response, and bradycardia virtually identical
to those produced by i.v. morphine. All of these effects of
either i.v. DAGO or i.v. morphine were significantly attenuated
by either bilateral CVAG or pre-treatment with the mu 2 opioid
receptor antagonist beta-FNA. Pre-treatment with the mu 1 opioid
receptor antagonist naloxonazine affected i.v. DAGO- induced
inhibition of the TF reflex and bradycardia, but had no
significant effects on i.v. morphine-produced responses. I.v.
administration of DPDPE produced a dose-dependent pressor
response, but had no marked effects on the either the TF reflex
or heart rate (HR). The pressor response was unaffected by either
bilateral CVAG or pre-treatment with naltrindole, naloxone,
hexamethonium, or bertylium. i.v. administration of U-50,488H
produced a depressor response and bradycardia, but had no
significant effect on the TF reflex. The depressor response and
bradycardia produced by i.v. U-50,488H were unaffected by
bilateral CVAG, but could be antagonized by pre- treatment with
either nor-BNI or naloxone. These studies suggest that the vagal
afferent-mediated antinociceptive and cardiovascular effects of
i.v. morphine are primarily mediated by interactions with low
affinity mu 2 opioid receptors. </p>

<p>Abstract: In this article, first, the different stages of
acquisition and processing of nociceptive information from
peripheral receptor to brain are reviewed and the plastic changes
that accompany tissue injury are underlined. For instance, the
subclassification of peripheral receptors in nociceptors and
non-nociceptors (e.g., mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors) must be
understood in the light of peripheral sensitization. This
phenomenon is the probable explanation for primary hyperalgesia,
the decrease in pain threshold at the site of injury. The
observation that substance P enhances N-methyl- D-aspartate
(NMDA)-elicited responses suggests that these two receptors may
operate in concert to prolong and amplify the afferent input
generated by peripheral tissue injury. Such afferent barrage
induces a state of central sensitization. Second, the major
problems in the management of cancer pain, i.e. the development
of tolerance to opioids and opioid-insensitive pain, are
discussed. The loss of drug effect observed after chronic
exposure of the opioid receptor (tolerance) may be the
consequence of the down-regulation or desensitization phenomenon
(where the total number of receptors coupled to the second
messenger is reduced). The agonist dose- response begins to shift
to the right. The dramatic analgesic improvement obtained with
subanaesthetic doses of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, in
those of our cancer patients who have become resistant to
morphine is intriguing. As shown for tolerance, insensitivity to
opioids may represent a rightward shift in the opioid
dose-response curve and the analgesic effect of ketamine the
reversal of that shift. </p>

<p>Journal Title: SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER. </p>

<p>Abstract: Over 70% of patients with cancer have moderate to
severe pain during their illness and many fear pain more than
death itself. There is consensus among experts that most patients
can be well-palliated using knowledge, medications, and
techniques that are readily accessible. Despite this, only a
small proportion of patients with cancer pain receive adequate
analgesia. Some of the barriers that interfere with the delivery
of appropriate analgesia are patient-related, while others
involve health-care providers. Patients frequently do not
communicate the intensity of their pain to care- givers and are
often hesitant to take opiates. Health-care providers receive
scant teaching on cancer pain, have little awareness of pain
intensity in their patients, and may be overly concerned about
opiate toxicities. They lack appropriate role models in academic
institutions and may be concerned about the potential for
investigation by law-enforcement agencies. These obstacles can be
largely overcome by (a) emphasizing the importance of pain
control in cancer patients, (b) considering the etiology of pain
in each patient, (c) weighing the full range of available
therapeutic options, (d) ensuring that &quot;user-friendly&quot;
opiate- equivalence information is available, (e) using pain
assessment tools routinely and recording pain intensity scores in
the medical record, and by (f) not being easily dissuaded from
providing adequate doses of opiates for pain relief. The
rationale for and current efforts in each of these areas are
discussed in this review. </p>

mechanism is often difficult. Available procedures are: 1) Nerve
repair, neurolysis and nerve relocation; 2) Interventions on the
sympathetic nervous system; 3) Neurostimulation; 4) Intraspinal
morphine; 5) Ablative lesions. Neurosurgeons have, or should
have, the necessary neuroscience background and microsurgical
skills to be important partners of the team caring for patients
with peripheral neuropathic pain. </p>

PRACTICE. </p>

<p>Abstract: The recognition and alleviation of animal pain is a
growing veterinary and public concern. Pain can be of an acute or
chronic nature with different behavioral manifestations.
Physiologically, pain is a dynamic and complex phenomenon that
produces changes in the central and autonomic nervous systems as
well as in the endocrine system. Horses and other animals appear
to possess an endogenous pain-suppressing system involving the
brainstem and spinal cord. This system can modulate pain
perception and the responses to it. The recently discovered
endogenous opioid peptides (endorphins and enkephalins) appear to
play a role in this system, which is activated by stress. Opioids
(narcotic analgesics) act to selectively depress pain- sensitive
cells. Opioid analgesics may act via multiple opioid receptors.
Each subclass of opioid receptor has a different pharmacologic
profile. Classical opioids that act at mu (morphine) receptors
typically produce analgesia, increased locomotor activity,
cardiorespiratory stimulation, and a decrease in intestinal
peristalsis in the horse. Opioids that act at kappa receptors
produce analgesia, sedation, ataxia, and minimal autonomic
effects in the horse. Owing to their lack of excitatory actions,
the kappa opioids represent a potentially useful class of
analgesics for use in equine species. Local anesthetics depress
all excitable cells and can diminish sensory, motor, and muscular
function. They do not act selectively on pain fibers, although
pain is among the first sensations lost following a nerve block.
Local anesthetic activity is enhanced by increased extraneuronal
pH, nerve cooling, increased nervous activity, coadministration
of a vasoconstrictor or hyaluronidase, delayed systemic
absorption, prolonged drug metabolism, and by using agents with
high lipid solubility. Procaine, lidocaine, and mepivacaine are
among the most widely used and studied agents in horses. These
agents and/or their metabolites can be readily detected in urine;
in some cases, for prolonged periods. </p>

<p>Journal Title: JAPANESE JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY. </p>

<p>Abstract: We have examined whether or not the presence of pain
can block the development of tolerance to morphine
antinociception in mice. A single injection of formalin or Freund
complete adjuvant into the dorsal part of one side of the hind
paw resulted in a significant swelling of the treated paw which
lasted more than 5 days. In formalin-treated animals that
received the initial morphine 2 hr after the stimulant, the
development of tolerance to morphine was delayed without
affecting morphine antinociception when the effect was measured
daily by the tail-pinch (TP) method but not by the tail-flick
(TF) method. However, the stimulant suppressed tolerance
development even in the TF method unless the daily measurement
was undertaken. When morphine injection was started from 5 days
after the formalin injection, tolerance developed in a pattern
similar to that in the control animals. On the other hand,
treatment with Freund adjuvant did not affect the development of
tolerance measured by both the TP and TF methods, with or without
daily measurement of antinociception. When acetic acid was used
as a stimulant, daily morphine was administered before or after
the acetic acid injection, in the presence or absence of pain,
tolerance developed to the same extent as in the control group,
regardless of the time of morphine injection. Thus, our results
suggest that the development of tolerance to narcotics may be
modified by various factors, such as the type and intensity of
nociception; and they also suggest that different results may be
produced depending on the test method. </p>

require either continuous infusion or repeated frequent
injections which are both inconvenient and uncomfortable. An
extended-release formulation of morphine sulfate (Depo/Morphine)
in a lipid-based drug- delivery system was characterized and
tested in an animal model. The encapsulation efficiency was 53%
+/- 4%, and the in vitro release T1/2 in human plasma at 37
degrees C was 12.1 +/- 1.1 days. Following s.c. administration of
Depo/Morphine, the total amount of morphine remaining at the s.c.
injection site decreased monoexponentially with a T1/2 value of
2.59 +/- 0.16 days as compared with 0.46 +/- 0.04 h following the
injection of unencapsulated morphine. The morphine concentration
in plasma also decreased monoexponentially with a T1/2 value of
8.33 +/- 2.13 days as compared with 0.45 +/- 0.21 h for
unencapsulated morphine. Cataleptic behavior was observed in mice
injected with unencapsulated morphine but not in those given an
identical dose of morphine in the form of Depo/Morphine. In
conclusion, Depo/Morphine has potential as an extended-release
formulation of morphine and may be useful in chemotherapy of
cancer pain as well as in maintenance therapy of narcotic
addicts. </p>

potassium channel openers and opioid agonists: a common mechanism
of action? </p>

<p>Source: J-Pharmacol-Exp-Ther. 1993 Oct. 267(1). P 390-9. </p>

<p>Journal Title: JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL
THERAPEUTICS. </p>

<p>Abstract: The potassium channel openers could share a common
mechanism of action with the opiates in the production of
antinociception because both classes of drugs have been shown to
enhance potassium efflux. The i.t. administration of the
potassium channel openers diazoxide, minoxidil, and lemakalim
(BRL38227) produced antinociception as measured in the tail-flick
test. The ED50's were 122, 184 and 35 micrograms/mouse,
respectively. Minoxidil and lemakalim (BRL 38227) were full
agonists, whereas diazoxide was a partial agonist.
Diazoxide-induced antinociception was blocked by the potassium
channel blockers glyburide, apamin and charybdotoxin. Minoxidil-
and lemakalim (i.t.)-induced antinociception was blocked totally
by only glyburide. The antinociception produced by the potassium
channel openers (i.t.) was blocked differentially by opiate
antagonists (i.t.). The antinociceptive effects of diazoxide were
blocked by nor binaltorphimine, ICI 174,864 and naloxone.
Minoxidil- and lemakalim-induced antinociception was blocked by
naloxone and ICI 174,864, but not by nor-binaltorphimine.
Naloxone (s.c.) shifted the dose-effect curve for minoxidil to
the right in a parallel manner. Morphine-induced antinociception
was partially blocked by glyburide and apamin, whereas that
produced by DPDPE was blocked totally by apamin. U50,
488H-induced antinociception was blocked partially by apamin. The
potassium channel openers (i.t.) were not cross tolerant to
morphine when measured in the tail-flick test. Apamin and
glyburide precipitated &quot;withdrawal-like&quot; symptoms in
morphine-tolerant mice. The interaction of potassium channel
openers and opioids probably does not represent a direct
interaction of these two classes of drugs at a similar receptor,
but rather may occur via an interaction with a common second
messenger system such as calcium. </p>

<p>Journal Title: DRUGS. </p>

<p>Abstract: Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional
experience, unique to each individual patient. In the dynamic
processes of nociceptive stimulation, signal transmission,
central decoding and interpretation there are many potential
sites for pharmacological intervention, and there are many drugs
which will produce analgesia. An analgesic 'ladder' has been
proposed for rational pain relief in cancer and a similar concept
should be used in all forms of acute and chronic pain. Continuing
research and drug development undoubtedly extends our
understanding, but consistent improvement in our clinical ability
to relieve pain depends more on our willingness to consider the
need of each patient individually, to tailor the drug, route and
mode of administration to that patient's requirements, and then
to monitor on the basis of the response of the patient to the
treatment. </p>

<p>Journal Title: CLINICAL THERAPEUTICS. </p>

<p>Abstract: Pain is the most common symptom experienced in
patients with advanced cancer. This pain may be acute, chronic,
or intermittent, and often has a definable origin, usually
related to tumor recurrence and treatment. The goal of therapy is
to provide patients with enough pain relief to enable them to
tolerate diagnostic and therapeutic manipulations and allow them
freedom of movement and choice, while limiting medication-induced
adverse effects. Morphine is the medication of choice, and is
available in a sustained-release oral formulation with convenient
around-the-clock administration every 8 to 12 hours. Morphine can
also be administered subcutaneously, intravenously, and rectally,
which provides enhanced flexibility for dosing patients unable to
take oral medications. The transdermal fentanyl patch may provide
a convenient dosage-form alternative if oral morphine
preparations are not tolerated. Some patients with advanced
cancer may require other adjunctive medications such as
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, tricyclic antidepressants,
steroids, or benzodiazepines, as well as psychologic techniques,
to assist in pain management. </p>

beta- endorphin- but not mu-, delta- or kappa-opioid

<p>Journal Title: EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY. </p>

<p>Abstract: L-Arginine pretreated i.c.v. produced a time- and
dose- dependent potentiation of beta-endorphin-induced inhibition
of the tail-flick response in ICR mice. However, the inhibition
of the tail-flick response induced by morphine, DAMGO ([D-
Ala2,NMePhe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin), DPDPE ([D-Pen2,D-
Pen5]enkephalin or U50,488H given i.c.v. was not potentiated by
i.c.v. pretreated L-arginine. The results indicate that L-
arginine selectively potentiates antinociception induced by
epsilon-opioid receptor agonist, but not mu-, delta- or kappa-
opioid receptor agonist. L-Arginine pretreated i.t. did not
potentiate i.c.v. administered beta-endorphin-induced inhibition
of the tail-flick response, indicating that the potentiating
effect of L-arginine on beta-endorphin-induced antinociception is
located at the supraspinal sites but not at the spinal sites. </p>

or guanethidine? </p>

<p>Source: Pain. 1993 Jan. 52(1). P 41-7. </p>

<p>Journal Title: PAIN. </p>

<p>Abstract: The putative antinociceptive action of guanethidine
and calcitonin systemically injected has been compared in 2 rat
models of persistent experimental pain: Freund's adjuvant-induced
arthritis (n = 29) and mononeuropathy induced by 4 loose
ligatures around the sciatic nerve (n = 24). Guanethidine (30
mg/kg, i.v.) and calcitonin (0.125 mg, s.c.) were injected once a
day over 1 week, when hyperalgesia was fully developed. The
antinociceptive action was gauged using nociceptive tests based
on mechanical or cold stimuli (vocalization threshold to paw
pressure and struggle latency to 10 degrees C, respectively), and
the score of spontaneous pain-related behavior was measured on
the basis of the abnormal hind paw position. No antinociceptive
action was observed in calcitonin-compared to saline-injected
rats, either in arthritic or neuropathic animals. Guanethidine
treatment was ineffective on hyperalgesia exhibited in arthritic
rats but was able to reduce reliably and even suppress the
abnormal reactions to cold stimulus in neuropathic animals. The
lack of hypoalgesic action of calcitonin versus its beneficial
action in bone repair, as well as the possible role(s) of the
sympathetic system in neuropathic versus arthritic pain and in
hyperalgesia versus physical signs of inflammation, are
discussed. </p>

<p>Abstract: Three novel benzomorphans,
(+)-N-benzylnormetazocine, (-)- deoxy-N-benzylnormetazocine, and
(-)-deoxypentazocine were tested for their ability to produce
circling behavior in rats following intranigral microinjections.
Dose studies revealed the following rank order of potency:
(-)-deoxypentazocine &gt; (- )-deoxy-N-benzylnormetazocine &gt;
(+)-N-benzylnormetazocine. This rank order approximates that for
affinities for sigma 2 receptors but not sigma 1 receptors. It is
very unlikely that the effects of the (-)-deoxybenzomorphans were
mediated by opiate receptors for the following reasons: (1)
consistent with the known requirement for the phenolic hydroxyl
group for opiate activity, both (-)-deoxy compounds showed very
low affinity for opiate receptors; (2) naloxone (4 micrograms)
co- administered with (-)-deoxy-N-benzylnormetazocine failed to
reduce its efficacy; (3) both (-)-deoxy compounds failed to
produce marked analgesic effects in the tail flick test following
systemic injections of 20 mg/kg s.c. These finding suggest that
sigma 2 receptors mediate the motor effects of sigma ligands in
rats. </p>

<p>Abstract: The major clinical uses for opioids are to control

however, have the potential for abuse. It is postulated that the
significant mood-altering effects of opioids combined with their
pharmacology, in which tolerance and physical and psychological
dependence occur, account for their abuse liability. A
classification of the groups of patients that commonly present
with complications of opioid use is reviewed briefly before
discussing the clinical pharmacology of the opioids and their
acute and toxic effects. </p>

<p>Source: Ann-Emerg-Med. 1993 Sep. 22(9). P 1444-9. </p>

<p>Journal Title: ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE. </p>

<p>Abstract: STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of high-dose
IV narcotics in patients requiring analgesia for painful
emergency department procedures. DESIGN: Prospective multicenter
clinical trial. SETTING: Five adult urban EDs. METHODS AND
MEASUREMENTS: All patients received IV meperidine (1.5 to 3.0
mg/kg) titrated to analgesia followed by a painful procedure.
Vital signs and alertness scale were recorded at regular
intervals, and patients were observed for four hours. Adverse
events were monitored and documented. Comparisons between
baseline and postanalgesia intervals were made with a repeated
measures ANOVA (Dunnett's test). RESULTS: Although statistically
significant changes in vital signs and alertness scale occurred,
they were not clinically significant. Opiate reversal with
naloxone was not needed in any patient, and no significant
respiratory or circulatory compromise occurred. CONCLUSION: This
study of 72 patients demonstrates that high- dose narcotic
analgesia is appropriate, well tolerated, and safe when used in
selected patients before painful procedures in the ED. Narcotic
antagonists and resuscitation equipment nonetheless should be
available to maximize safety. </p>

<p>Abstract: A study of irritable bowel-type symptoms in 1264
health examinees using a self-administered questionnaire and
psychological tests revealed they are common throughout
adulthood. Of affected subjects 68% were female, and those with
the more severe type (&gt; or = 3 Manning criteria) were
predominantly female (80%). Fewer Asians than other racial/ethnic
groups had these symptoms. Nongastrointestinal symptoms,
physician visits, incontinence, laxative use, a stress effect on
bowel pattern and abdominal pain, abdominal surgery,
hysterectomy, childhood abuse, use of mind- altering drugs,
depression, and anxiety were correlated with irritable bowel-type
symptoms. Regression analysis found some of the clinical
correlates were independent markers for irritable bowel-type
symptoms and that sexual abuse was related to nongastrointestinal
symptoms and abdominal surgery independent of irritable
bowel-type symptoms. More severe irritable bowel-type symptoms
were especially associated with nongastrointestinal symptoms,
stress effects, sexual abuse, use of sedatives and oral
narcotics, and a past alcohol problem. There are important
demographic and clinical correlates with irritable bowel-type
symptoms. </p>

<p>Abstract: We report a case of the eosinophilia myalgia

to a severe polyneuropathy, and contractures in all four
extremities requiring aggressive rehabilitation treatment. A
55-year-old woman was admitted to a rehabilitation hospital 11
months after the onset of EMS. At that time, she had severe
weakness secondary to peripheral neuropathy and painful
contractures in all extremities and required high doses of
narcotics for pain control. A continuous passive range of motion
machine was used in order to maintain range of motion obtained
during active exercise therapy. The patient showed functional
improvement in basic mobility and ADL skills. She was withdrawn
from narcotics and successfully learned pain management
techniques. An aggressive rehabilitation approach in the
treatment of EMS associated with peripheral neuropathy may
improve functional outcome even when instituted late in the
clinical course. </p>

<p>Abstract: Continuous passive motion (CPM) may have potential
application as a physical modality in decreasing acute pain. The
purpose of this study was to examine the effects of CPM
immediately following an arthroscopically-assisted anterior
cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction utilizing bone-patella-
bone autograft on acute pain during the inflammatory phase of
soft tissue healing. Acute pain was measured by assessing the
amount of pain medication (amount of narcotic delivered from the
patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump during the first
postoperative 24 hours and the total intake of oral medication
during the second and third postoperative days), the need for
pain medication (number of times the patient pushed the PCA
button during the first postoperative 24 hours), and perceived
pain (graphic pain scale measuring antalgic sensation). Thirty
patients (15-45 years old) participated in this study. The
patients were prospectively randomized into two groups, CPM and
non-CPM. Both groups followed an identical postoperative
rehabilitation program except for the CPM groups using a CPM
device. The design of this study included the collection of data
during the inflammatory phase of soft tissue healing. The results
indicated that the initiation of CPM immediately following an ACL
reconstruction had a significant (p &lt; .05) effect on
decreasing the amount of medication consumed by the patient and a
significant (p &lt; .05) decrease in the patient's need for
medication during the inflammatory phase. There was no
statistical significance in the level of perceived pain between
the groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </p>

<H2>The Mushrooms of Language</H2>
<H3>by Henry Munn (1)</H3>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Mazatec Indians, who have a long tradition of using the mushrooms,
inhabit a range of mountains called the Sierra Mazateca in the
northeastern corner of the Mexican state of Oaxaca. The shamans
in this essay are all natives of the town of Huautla de Jimenez.
Properly speaking they are Huautecans; but since the language
they speak has been called Mazatec and they have been referred
to in the previous anthropological literature as Mazatecs, I have
retained that name, though strictly speaking, Mazatecs are the
inhabitants of the village of Mazatlan in the same mountains.

among the Conibo Indians of eastern Peru and the Mazatec Indians
of the mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico. Although not a professional
anthropologist, he has resided for extended periods of time among
the Mazatecs and is married to the niece of the shaman and shamaness
referred to in this essay.

<P>
The Mazatec Indians eat the mushrooms only at night in absolute
darkness. It is their belief that if you eat them in the daylight
you will go mad. The depths of the night are recognized as the
time most conducive to visionary insights into the obscurities,
the mysteries, the perplexities of existence. Usually several
members of a family eat the mushrooms together: it is not uncommon
for a father, mother, children, uncles, and aunts to all participate
in these transformations of the mind that elevate consciousness
onto a higher plan. The kinship relation is thus the basis of
the transcendental subjectivity that Husserl said is intersubjectivity.
The mushrooms themselves are eaten in pairs, a couple representing
man and woman that symbolizes the dual principle of procreation
and creation. Then they sit together in their inner light, dream
and realize and converse with each other, presences seated there
together, their bodies immaterialized by the blackness, voices
from without their communality.
<P>
In a general sense, for everyone present the purpose of the session
is a therapeutic catharsis. The chemicals of transformation of
revelation that open the circuits of light, vision, and communication,
called by us mind-manifesting, were known to the American Indians
as medicines: the means given to men to know and to heal, to see
and to say the truth. Among the Mazatecs, many, one time or another
during their lives, have eaten the mushrooms, whether to cure
themselves of an ailment or to resolve a problem; but it is not
everyone who has a predilection for such extreme and arduous experiences
of the creative imagination or who would want to repeat such journeys
into the strange, unknown depths of the brain very frequently:
those who do are the shamans, the masters, whose vocation it is
to eat the mushrooms because they are the men of the spirit, the
men of language, the men of wisdom. They are individuals recognized
by their people to be expert in such psychological adventures,
and when the others eat the mushrooms they always call to be with
them, as a guide, one of those who is considered to be particularly
acquainted with these modalities of the spirit. The medicine man
presides over the session, for just as the Mazatec family is paternal
and authoritarian, the liberating experience unfolds in the authoritarian
context of a situation in which, rather than being allowed to
speak or encouraged to express themselves, everyone is enjoined
to keep silent and listen while the shaman speaks for each of
those who are present. As one of the early Spanish chroniclers
of the New World said: &quot;They pay a sorcerer who eats them
[the mushrooms] and tells them what they have taught him. He does
so by means of a rhythmic chant in full voice.&quot;
<P>
The Mazatecs say that the mushrooms speak. If you ask a shaman
where his imagery comes from, he is likely to reply: I didn't
say it, the mushrooms did. No mushroom speaks, that is a primitive
anthropomorphization of the natural, only man speaks, but he who
eats these mushrooms, if he is a man of language, becomes endowed
with an inspired capacity to speak. The shamans who eat them,
their function is to speak, they are the speakers who chant and
sing the truth, they are the oral poets of their people, the doctors
of the word, they who tell what is wrong and how to remedy it,
the seers and oracles, the ones possessed by the voice. &quot;It
is not I who speak,&quot; said Heraclitus, &quot;it is the logos.&quot;
Language is an ecstatic activity of signification. Intoxicated
by the mushrooms, the fluency, the ease, the aptness of expression
one becomes capable of are such that one is astounded by the words
that issue forth from the contact of the intention of articulation
with the matter of experience. At times it is as if one were being
told what to say, for the words leap to mind, one after another,
of themselves without having to be searched for: a phenomenon
similar to the automatic dictation of the surrealists except that
here the flow of consciousness, rather than being disconnected,
tends to be coherent: a rational enunciation of meanings. Message
fields of communication with the world, others, and one's self
are disclosed by the mush rooms The spontaneity they liberate
is not only perceptual, but linguistic, the spontaneity of speech,
of fervent, lucid discourse, of the logos in activity. For the
shaman, it is as if existence were uttering itself through him.
From the beginning, once what they have eaten has modified their
consciousness, they begin to speak and at the end of each phrase
they say <I>tzo</I>-&quot;says&quot; in their language-like a
rhythmic punctuation of the said. Says, says, says. It is said.
I say. Who says? We say, man says, language says, being and existence
say.<A NAME="back2"></A> <A HREF="#footnote2">(2)</A> 
<P>
Cross-legged on the floor in the darkness of huts, close to the
fire, breathing the incense of copal, the shaman sits with the
furrowed brow and the marked mouth of speech. Chanting his words,
clapping his hands, rocking to and fro, he speaks in the night
of chirping crickets. What is said is more concrete than ephemeral
phantasmagoric lights: words are materializations of consciousness;
language is a privileged vehicle of our relation to reality. Let
us go looking for the tracks of the spirit, the shamans say. Let
us go to the cornfield looking for the tracks of the spirits'
feet in the warm ground. So then let us go walking ourselves along
the path in search of significance, following the words of two
discourses enregistered like tracks on magnetic tapes, then translated
from the native tonal language, to discover and explicitate what
is said by an Indian medicine man and medicine woman during such
ecstatic experiences of the human voice speaking with rhythmic
force the realities of life and society.
<P>
The short, stout, elderly woman with her laughing moon face, dressed
in a <I>huipil,</I> the long dress, embroidered with flowers and
birds, of the Mazatec women, a dark shawl wrapped around her shoulders,
her gray hair parted down the middle and drawn into two pigtails,
golden crescents hanging from her ears, bent forward from where
she knelt on the earthen floor of the hut and held a handful of
mushrooms in the fragrant, purifying smoke of copal rising from
the glowing coals of the fire, to bless them: known to the ancient
Meso-Americans as the Flesh of God, called by her people the Blood
of Christ. Through their miraculous mountains of light and rain,
the Indians say that Christ once walked-it is a transformation
of the legend of Quetzalcoatl-and from where dropped his blood,
the essence of his life, from there the holy mushrooms grew, the
awakeners of the spirit, the food of the luminous one. Flesh of
the world. Flesh of language. In the beginning was the word and
the word became flesh. In the beginning there was flesh and the
flesh became linguistic. Food of intuition. Food of wisdom. She
ate them, munched them up, swallowed them and burped; rubbed ground-up
tobacco along her wrists and forearms as a tonic for the body;
extinguished the candle; and sat waiting in the darkness where
the incense rose from the embers like glowing white mist. Then
after a while came the enlightenment and the enlivenment and all
at once, out of the silence, the woman began to speak, to chant,
to pray, to sing, to utter her existence: <A NAME="back3"></A><A HREF="#footnote3">(3)</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My God, you who are the master of the whole world, what we want
is to search for and encounter from where comes sickness, from
where comes pain and affliction. We are the ones who speak and
cure and use medicine. So without mishap, without difficulty,
lift us into the heights and exalt us.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
From the beginning, the problem is to discover what the sickness
is the sick one is suffering from and prognosticate the remedy.
Medicine woman, she eats the mushrooms to see into the spirit
of the sick, to disclose the hidden, to intuit how to resolve
the unsolved: for an experience of revelations. The transformation
of her everyday self is transcendental and gives her the power
to move in the two relevant spheres of transcendence in order
to achieve understanding: that of the other consciousness where
the symptoms of illness can be discerned; and that of the divine,
the source of the events in the world. Together with visionary
empathy, her principal means of realization is articulation, discourse,
as if by saying she will say the answer and announce the truth.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is necessary to look and think in her spirit where it hurts.
I must think and search in your presence where your glory is,
My Father, who art the Master of the World. Where does this sickness
come from? Was it a whirlwind or bad air that fell in the door
or in the doorway? So are we going to search and to ask, from
the head to the feet, what the matter is. Let's go searching for
the tracks of her feet to encounter the sickness that she is suffering
from. Animals in her heart? Let's go searching for the tracks
of her feet, the tracks of her nails. That it be alleviated and
healed where it hurts. What are we going to do to get rid of this
sickness?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For the Mazatecs, the psychedelic experience produced by the mushrooms
is inseparably associated with the cure of illness. The idea of
malady should be understood to mean not only physical illness,
but mental troubles and ethical problems. It is when something
is wrong that the mushrooms are eaten. If there is nothing the
matter with you there is no reason to eat them. Until recent times,
the mushrooms were the only medicine the Indians had recourse
to in times of sickness. 'I heir medicinal value is by no means
merely magical, but chemical. According to the Indians, syphilis,
cancer, and epilepsy have been alleviated by their use; tumors
cured. They have empirically been found by the Indians to be particularly
effective for the treatment of stomach disorders and irritations
of the skin. The woman whose words we are listening to, like many,
discovered her shamanistic vocation when she was cured by the
mushrooms of an illness: after the death of her husband she broke
out all over with pimples; she was given the mushrooms to see
whether they would &quot;help&quot; her and the malady disappeared.
Since then she has eaten them on her own and given them to others.
<P>
If someone is sick, the medicine man is called. The treatment
he employs is chemical and spiritual. Unlike most shamanistic
methods, the Mazatec shaman actually gives medicine to his patients:
by means of the mushrooms he administers to them physiologically,
at the same time as he alters their consciousness. It is probably
for psychosomatic complaints and psychological troubles that the
liberation of spontaneous activity provoked by the mushrooms is
most remedial: given to the depressed, they awaken a catharsis
of the spirit; to those with problems, a vision of their existential
way. If he hasn't come to the conclusion that the illness is incurable,
the medicine man repeats the therapeutic sessions three times
at intervals. He also works over the sick, for his intoxicated
condition of intense, vibrant energy gives him a strength to heal
that he exercises by massage and suction.
<P>
His most important function, however, is to speak for the sick
one. The Mazatec shamans eat the mushrooms that liberate the fountains
of language to be able to speak beautifully and with eloquence
so that their words, spoken for the sick one and those present,
will arrive and be heard in the spirit world from which comes
benediction or grief. The function of the speaker, nevertheless,
is much more than simply to implore. The shaman has a conception
of <I>poesis</I> <A HREF="#footnote4">(4)</A> in its original
sense as an action: words themselves are medicine. To enunciate
and give meaning to the events and situations of existence is
life giving in itself<I>.</I><A NAME="back4"></A> 
<P>
&quot;The psychoanalyst listens, whereas the shaman speaks,&quot;
points out Levi-Strauss:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When a transference is established, the patient puts words into
the mouth of the psychoanalyst by attributing to him alleged feelings
and intentions; in the incantation, on the contrary, the shaman
speaks for his patient. He questions her and puts into her mouth
answers that correspond to the interpretation of her condition.
A pre-requisite role-that of listener for the psychoanalyst and
of orator for the shaman-establishes a direct relationship with
the patient's conscious and an indirect relationship with his
unconscious. This is the function of the incantation proper. The
shaman provides the sick woman with a <I>language</I> by means
of which unexpressed and otherwise inexpressible psychic states
can be immediately expressed. And it is the transition to this
verbal expression-at the same time making it possible to undergo
in an ordered and intelligible form a real experience that would
otherwise be chaotic and inexpressible- which induces the release
of the physiological process, that is, the reorganization, in
a favorable direction, of the process to which the sick woman
is subjected.<A NAME="back5"></A> <A HREF="#footnote5">(5)</A>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
These remarks of the French anthropologist become particularly
relevant to Mazatec shamanistic practice when one considers that
the effect of the mushrooms, used to make one capable of curing,
is to inspire the shaman with language and transform him into
an oracle.
<P>
&quot;That come all the saints, that come all the virgins,&quot;
chants the medicine woman in her sing-song voice, invoking the
beneficent forces of the universe, calling to her the goddesses
of fertility, the virgins: fertile ones because they have not
been sowed and are fresh for the seed of men to beget children
in their wombs.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Virgin of Conception and the Virgin of the Nativity. That
Christ come and the Holy Spirit. Fifty-three Saints. Fifty-three
Saintesses. That they sit down at her side, on her mat, on her
bed, to free her from sickness.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The wife of the man in whose house she was speaking was pregnant
and throughout the session of creation, from the midst of genesis,
her language as spontaneous as her being that has begun to vibrate,
she concerns herself with the emergence of life, with the birth
of an existence into that everyday social world that. her developing
discourse expresses:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With the baby that is going to come there is no suffering, says.
It's a matter of a moment, there isn't going to be any suffering,
says. From one moment to another it will fall into the world,
says. From one moment to another, we are going to save her from
her woe, says. That her innocent creature come without mishap,
says. Her elf. That is what it is called when it is still in the
womb of its mother. From one moment to another, that her innocent
creature, her elf come, says.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&quot;We are going to search and question,&quot; she says, &quot;untie
and disentangle.&quot; She is on a journey, for there is distanciation
and going there, somewhere, without her even moving from the spot
where she sits and speaks. Her consciousness is roaming throughout
existential space. Sibyl, seer, and oracle, she is on the track
of significance and the pulsation of her being is like the rhythm
of walking.
<P>
&quot;Let us go searching for the path, the tracks of her feet,
the tracks of her nails. From the right side to the left side,
let us look.&quot; To arrive at the truth, to solve problems and
to act with wisdom, it is necessary to find the way in which to
go. Meaning is intentional. Possibilities are paths to be chosen
between. For the Indian woman, footprints are images of meaning,
traces of a going to and from, sedimented clues of significance
to be looked for from one side to the other and followed to where
they lead: indicators of directionality; signs of existence. The
hunt for meaning is a temporal one, carried into the past and
projected into the future; what happened? she inquires, what will
happen? leaving behind for what is ahead go the footprints between
departure and arrival: manifestations of human, existential ecstasis.
And the method of looking, from the right side to the left side,
is the articulation of now this intuition, fact, feeling or wish,
now that, the intention of speaking bringing to light meanings
whose associations and further elucidations are like the discovery
of a path where the contents to be uttered are tracks to be followed
into the unexplored, the unknown and unsaid into which she adventures
by language, the seeker of significance, the questioner of significance,
the articulator of significance: the significance of existence
that signifies with signs by the action of speaking the experience
of existence.
<P>
&quot;Woman of medicines and curer, who walks with her appearance
and her soul,&quot; sings the woman, bending down to the ground
and straightening up, rocking back and forth as she chants, dividing
the truth in time to her words: emitter of signs. &quot;She is
the woman of the remedy and the medicine. She is the woman who
speaks. The woman who puts everything together. Doctor woman.
Woman of words. Wise woman of problems.&quot;
<P>
She is not speaking, most of the time, for any particular person,
but for everyone: all who are afflicted, troubled, unhappy, puzzled
by the predicaments of their condition. Now, in the course of
her discourse, uttering realities, not hallucinations, talking
of existence in a communal world where the we is more frequent
than the I, she comes to a more general sickness and aggravation
than physical illness: the economic condition of poverty in which
her people live.
<P>
&quot;Let us go to the cornfield searching for the tracks of the
feet, for her poorness and humility. That gold and silver come,&quot;
she prays. &quot;Why are we poor? Why are we humble in this town
of Huautla?&quot; That is the paradox: why in the midst of such
great natural wealth as their fertile, plentiful mountains where
waterfalls cascade through the green foliage of leaves and ferns,
should they be miserable from poverty, she wants to know. The
daily diet of the Indians consists of black beans and tortillas
covered with red chili sauce; only infrequently, at festivals,
do they eat meat. White spots caused by malnutrition splotch their
red faces. Babies are often sick. It is wealth she pleads for
to solve the problem of want.
<P>
The mushrooms, which grow only during the season of torrential
rains, awaken the forces of creation and produce an experience
of spiritual abundance, of an astonishing, inexhaustible constitutionof forms that identifies them with fertility and makes them a
mediation, a means of communion, of communication between man
and the natural world of which they are the metaphysical flesh.
The theme of the shamaness, mother and grandmother, woman of fertility,
bending over as she chants and gathering the earth to her as if
she were collecting with her hands the harvest of her experience,
is that of giving birth, is that of growth. Agriculturalists,
they are people of close family interrelationships and many children:
the clusters of neolithic thatch-roofed houses on the mountain
peaks are of extended family groups. The woman's world is that
of the household, her concern is for her children and all the
children of her people.
<P>
&quot;All the family, the babies and the children, that happiness
come to them, that they grow and mature without anything befalling
them. Free them from all classes of sickness that there are here
in the earth. Without complaint and with good will,&quot; she
says, &quot;so will come well-being, will come gold. Then we will
have food. Our beans, our gourds, our coffee, that is what we
want. That come a good harvest. That come richness, that come
well-being for all of our children. All my shoots, my children,
my seeds,&quot; she sings.
<P>
But the world of her children is not to be her world, nor that
of their grandfathers. Their indigenous society is being transformed
by the forces of history. Until only recently, isolated from the
modern world, the Indians lived in their mountains as people lived
in the neolithic. There were only paths and they walked everywhere
they went. Trains of burros carried out the principal crop-coffee-to
the markets in the plain. Now roads have been built, blasted out
of rock and constructed along the edges of the mountains over
precipices! to connect the community with the society beyond.
The children are people of opposites: just as they speak two languages,
Mazatec and Spanish, they live between two times: the timeless,
cyclical time of recurrence of the People of the Deer and the
time of progress, change and development of modern Mexico. In
her discourse, no stereotyped rite or traditional ceremony with
prescribed words and actions, speaking of everything, of the ancient
and the modern, of what is happening to her people, the woman
of problems, peering into the future, recognizes the inevitable
process of transition, of disintegration and integration, that
confronts her children: the younger generation destined to live
the crisis and make the leap from the past into the future. For
them it is necessary to learn to read and to write and to speak
the language of this new world and in order to advance themselves,
to be educated and gain knowledge, contained in books, radically
different from the traditions of their own society whose language
is oral and unwritten, whose implements are the hoe, the axe,
and the machete.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Also a book is needed, says. Good book. Book of good reading in
Spanish, says. In Spanish. All your children, your creatures,
that their thought and their custom change, says. For me there
is no time. Without difficulty, let us go, says. With tenderness.
With freshness. With sweetness. With good will.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&quot;Don't leave us in darkness or blind us,&quot; she begs the
origins of light, for in these supernatural modalities of consciousness
there are dangers on every hand of aberration and disturbance.
&quot;Let us go along the good path. The path of the veins of
our blood. The path of the Master of the World. Let us go in a
path of happiness.&quot; The existential way, the conduct of one's
life, is an idea to which she returns again and again. The paths
she mentions are the moral, physical, mental, emotional qualities
typical of the experience of animated conscious activity from
the midst of which spring her words: goodness, vitality, reason,
transcendence, and joy. Seated on the ground in the darkness,
seeing with her eyes closed, her thought travels within along
the branching arteries of the bloodstream and without across the
fields of existence. There is a very definite physiological quality
about the mushroom experience which leads the Indians to say that
by a kind of visceral introspection they teach one the workings
of the organism: it is as if the system were projected before
one into a vision of the heart, the liver, lungs, genitals, and
stomach.
<P>
In the course of the medicine woman's discourse, it is understandable
that she should, from astonishment, from gratitude, from the knowledge
of experience, say something about the mushrooms that have provoked
her condition of inspiration. In a sense, to speak of &quot;the
mushroom experience&quot; is a reification as absurd as the anthropomorphization
of the mushrooms when it is said that they talk: the mushrooms
are merely the means, in interaction with the organism, the nervous
system, and the brain, of producing an experience grounded in
the ontological-existential possibilities of the human, irreducible
to the properties of a mushroom. The experience is psychological
and social. What is spoken of by the shamaness is her communal
world; even the visions of her imagination must have their origin
in the context of her existence and the myths of her culture.
The subject of another society will have other visions and express
a different content in his discourse. It would seem probable,
however, that apart from emotional similarities, colored illuminations,
and the purely abstract patterns of a universal conscious activity,
between the experiences of individuals with differing social inherences,
the common characteristic would be discourse, for judging by their
effect the chemical constituents of the mushrooms have some connection
with the linguistic centers of the brain. &quot;So says the teacher
of words,&quot; says the woman, &quot;so says the teacher of matters.&quot;
It is paradoxical that the rediscovery of such chemicals should
have related their effects to madness and pejoratively called
them drugs, when the shamans who used them spoke of them as medicines
and said from their experience that the metamorphosis they produced
put one into communication with the spirit. It is precisely the
value of studying the use in so-called primitive societies of
such chemicals that the way be found beyond the superficial to
a more essential understanding of phenomena which we, with our
limited conception of the rational, have too quickly, perhaps
mistakenly, termed irrational, instead of comprehending that such
experiences are revelations of a primordial existential activity,
of &quot;a power of signification, a birth of sense or a savage
sense.&quot; <A HREF="#footnote6">(6)</A> What are we confronted
with by the shamanistic discourse of the mushroom eaters? A modality
of reason in which the logos of existence enunciates itself, or
by the delirium and incoherence of derangement?<A NAME="back6"></A>

<P>
&quot;They are doing nothing but talk,&quot; says the medicine
woman, &quot;those who say that these matters are matters of the
past. They are doing nothing but talk, the people who call them
crazy mushrooms.&quot; They claim to have knowledge of what they
do not have any experience of; consequently their contentions
are nonsense: nothing but expressions of the conventionality the
mushrooms explode by their disclosure of the extraordinary; mere
chatter if it weren't for the fact that the omnipotent They forms
the force of repression which, by legislation and the implementation
of authority, has come to denominate infractions of the law and
the code of health, the means of liberation that once were called
medicines. In a time of pills and shots, of scientific medicine,
the wise woman is saying, the use of the mushrooms is not an anachronistic
and obsolete vestige of magical practices: their power to awaken
consciousness and cure existential ills is not any the less relevant
now than it was in the past. She insists that it is ignorance
of our dimension of mystery, of the wellsprings of meaning, to
think that their effect is insanity.
<P>
&quot;Good and happiness,&quot; she says, naming the emotions
of her activized, perceptualized being. &quot;They are not crazy
mushrooms. They are a remedy, says. A remedy for decent people.
For the foreigners,&quot; she says, speaking of us, wayfarers
from advanced industrial society, who had begun to arrive in the
high plazas of her people to experiment with the psychedelic mushrooms
that grew in the mountains of the Mazatecs. She has an inkling
of the truth, that what we look for is a cure of our alienations,
to be put back in touch, by violent means if necessary, with that
original, creative self that has been alienated from us by our
middle-class families, education, and corporate world of employment.
<P>
&quot;There in their land, it is taken account of, that there
is something in these mushrooms, that they are good, of use,&quot;
she says. &quot;The doctor that is here in our earth. The plant
that grows in this place. With this we are going to put together,
we are going to alleviate ourselves. It is our remedy. He that
suffers from pain and illness, with this it is possible to alleviate
him. They aren't called mushrooms. They are called prayer. They
are called well-being. They are called wisdom. They are there
with the Virgin, Our Mother, the Nativity.&quot; The Indians do
not call the mushrooms of light mushrooms, they call them the
holy ones. For the shamaness, the experience they produce is synonymous
with language, with communication, on behalf of her people, with
the supernatural forces of the universe; with plenitude and joyfulness;
with perception, insight, and knowledge. It is as if one were
born again; therefore their patroness is the Goddess of Birth,
the Goddess of Creation.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With prayers we will get rid of it all. With the prayers of the
ancients. We will clean ourselves, we will purify ourselves with
clear water, we will wash our intestines where they are infected.
That sicknesses of the body be gotten rid of. Sicknesses of the
atmosphere. Bad air. That they be gotten rid of, that they be
removed. That the wind carry them away. For this is the doctor.
For this is the plant. For this is the sorcerer of the light of
day. For this is the remedy. For this is the medicine woman, the
woman doctor who resolves all classes of problems in order to
rid us of them with her prayers. We are going with well-being,
without difficulty, to implore, to beg, to supplicate. Well being
for all the babies and the creatures. We are going to beg, to
implore for them, to beseech for their well-being and their studies,
that they live, that they grow, that they sprout. That freshness
come, tenderness, shoots, joy. That we be blessed, all of us.

She goes on talking and talking, non-stop; there are lulls when
her voice slows down, fades out almost to a whisper; then come
rushes of inspiration, moments of intense speech; she yawns great
yawns, laughs with jubilation, claps her hands in time to her
interminable singsong; but after the setting out, the heights
of ecstasy are reached, the intoxication begins to ebb away, and
she sounds the theme of going back to normal, everyday conscious
existence again after this excursion into the beyond, of rejoining
the ego she has transcended:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are going to return without mishap, along a fresh path, a good
path, a path of good air; in a path through the cornfield, in

Rich cock that reminds us that we live in this life.

The day that dawns is that of a new world in which there is no
longer any need to walk to where you go. &quot;With tenderness

fists, the tracks of the feet, the tracks of the nails.&quot;

It seemed that she had been speaking for eight hours. The seconds
of time were expanded, not from boredom, but from the intensity
of the lived experience. In terms of the temporality of clocks,
she had only been speaking for four hours when she concluded with
a vision of the transcendence that had become immanent and had
now withdrawn from her. &quot;There is the flesh of God. There
is the flesh of Jesus Christ. There with the Virgin.&quot; The
most frequently repeated words of the woman are freshness and
tenderness; those of the shaman, whose discourse we will now consider,
are fear and terror: what one might call the emotional poles of
these experiences. There is an illness that the Mazatecs speak
of that they name fright. We say traumatism. They walk through
their mountains along their arduous paths on the different levels
of being, climbing and descending, in the sunlight and through
the clouds; all around there are grottos and abysses, mysterious
groves, places where live the <I>laa</I>, the little people, mischievous
dwarfs and gnomes. Rivers and wells are inhabited by spirits with
powers of enchantment. At night in these altitudes, winds whirl
up from the depths, rush out of the distance like monsters, and
pass, tearing everything in their path with their fierce claws.
Phantoms appear in the mists. There are persons with the evil
eye. Existence in the world and with others is treacherous, perilous:
unexpectedly something may happen to you and that event, unless
it is exorcised, can mark you for life.
<P>
The Indians say following the beliefs of their ancestors, the
Siberians, that the soul is sometimes frightened from one, the
spirit goes, you are alienated from yourself or possessed by another:
you lose yourself. It is for this neurosis that the shamans, the
questioners of enigmas, are the great doctors and the mushrooms
the medicine. It is the task of the Mazatec shaman to look for
the extravagated spirit, find it, bring it back, and reintegrate
the personality of the sick one. If necessary, he pays the powers
that have appropriated the spirit by burying cacao, beans of exchange,
wrapped in the bark cloth of offerings, at the place of fright
which he has divined by vision. The mushrooms, the shamans say,
show: you see, in the sense that you realize, it is disclosed
to you. &quot;Bring her spirit, her soul,&quot; implores the medicine
woman to whom we have just been listening. &quot;Let her spirit
come back from where it got lost, from where it stayed, from where
it was left behind, from wherever it is that her spirit is wandering
lost.&quot;
<P>
With just such a traumatic experience, began the shamanistic vocation
of the man we will now study. In his late fifties, he has been
eating the mushrooms for nine years. Why did he begin? &quot;I
began to eat them because I was sick,&quot; he said when asked.<A NAME="back7"></A><A HREF="#footnote7">(7)</A>

No matter how much the doctors treated me, I didn't get well.
I went to the Latin American Hospital. I went to Cordoba as well.
I went to Mexico. I went to Tehuacan and wasn't alleviated. Only
with the mushrooms was I cured. I had to eat the mushrooms three
times and the man from San Lucas, who gave them to me, proposed
his work as a medicine man to me, telling me: now you are going
to receive my study. I asked him why he thought I was going to
receive it when I didn't want to learn anything about his wisdom,
I only wanted to get better and be cured of my illness. Then he
answered me: now it is no longer you who command. It is already
the middle of the night. I am going to leave you a table with
ground tobacco on it and a cross underneath it so that you learn
this work. Tell me which of these things you choose and like the
best of all, he said, when everything was ready. Which of these
works do you want? I answered that I didn't want what he offered
me. Here you don't give the orders, he replied; I am he who is
going to say whether you receive this work or not because I am
he who is going to give you your diploma in the presence of God.
Then I heard the voice of my father. He had been dead for forty-three
years when he spoke to me the first time that I ate the mushrooms:
This work that is being given to you, he said, I am he who tells
you to accept it. Whether you can see me or not, I don't know.
I couldn't imagine from where this voice came that was speaking
to me. Then it was that the shaman of San Lucas told me that the
voice I was hearing was that of my father. The sickness from which
I was suffering was alleviated by eating the mushrooms. So I told
the old man, I am disposed to receive what it is that you offer
me, but I want to learn everything. Then it was that he taught
me how to suck through space with a hollow tube of cane. To suck
through space means that you who are seated there, I can draw
the sickness out of you by suction from a distance.

What had begun as a physical illness, appendicitis, became a traumatic
neurosis. The doctors wheeled him into an operating room-he who
had never been in a hospital in his life-and suffocated him with
an ether mask. And he gave up the ghost while they cut the appendix
out of him. When he came to, he lay frightened and depressed,
without any will to live, he'd had enough. Instead of recuperating,
he lay like a dead man with his eyes wide open, not saying anything
to anyone, what was the use, his life had been a failure, he had
never become the important man he had aspired all his life to
be, now it was too late; his life was over and he had done nothing
that his children might remember with respect and awe. The doctors
couldn't help him because there was nothing wrong with him physically;
contrary to what he believed, he had survived the operation; the
slash into his stomach had been sewn up and had healed; nevertheless,
he remained apathetic and unresponsive, for he had been terrified
by death and his spirit had flown away like a bird or a fleet-footed
deer. He needed someone to go out and hunt it for him, to bring
back his spirit and resuscitate him.
<P>
The medicine man, from the nearby village of San Lucas, whom he
called to him when the modern doctors failed to cure him of the
strange malady he suffered from, was renowned throughout the mountains
as a great shaman, a diviner of destiny. The short, slight, wizened
old man was 105 years old. He gave to his patient, who was suffering
from depression, the mushrooms of vitality, and the therapy worked.
He vividly relived the operation in his imagination. According
to him, the mushrooms cut him open, arranged his insides, and
sewed him up again. One of the reasons he hadn't recovered was
his conviction that materialistic medicine was incapable of really
curing since it was divorced from all cooperation with the spirits
and dependence upon the supernatural.
<P>
In his imagination, the mushrooms performed another surgical intervention
and corrected the mistakes of the profane doctor which he considered
responsible for his lingering lethargy. He went through the whole
process in his mind. It was as if he were operating upon himself,
undoing what had been done to him, and doing it over again himself.
The trauma was exorcised. By intensely envisioning with a heightened,
expanded consciousness what had happened to him under anesthesia,
he assumed at last the frightening event he had previously been
unable to integrate into his experience. His physiological cure
was completed psychologically; he was finally healed by virtue
of the assimilative, creative powers of the imagination. The dead
man came back to life, he wanted to live because he felt once
again that he was alive and had the force to go on living: once
exhausted and despondent, he was now invigorated and rejuvenated.
<P>
The cure is successful because not only is his spirit awakened,
but he is offered another future: a new profession that is a compensation
for his humble one as a storekeeper. The ancient wise man, on
the brink of death, wants to transmit to the man in his prime,
his knowledge. What he encounters is resistance. The other doesn't
want to assume the vocation of shaman, he only wants to be cured,
without realizing that the cure is inseparable from the acceptance
of the vocation which will release him from the repression of
his creative forces that has caused the neurosis with which he
is afflicted. It is no longer you who command, he is told, for
his impulse to die is stronger than his desire to live; therefore
the counterforce, if it is to be effective, cannot be his: it
must be the will of the other transferred to him. You are too
far gone to have any say in the matter, the medicine man tells
him, it is already the middle of the night. By negating the will
of his patient, he arouses it and prepares him to accept what
is being suggested to him.
<P>
He shows him the table, the tobacco, the cross: signs of the shaman's
work. The table is an altar at which to officiate.. When the Mazatecs
eat the mushrooms they speak of the sessions as masses. The shaman,
even though a secular figure unordained by the Church, assumes
a sacerdotal role as the leader of these ceremonies. In a similar
way, for the Indians each father of a family is the religious
priest of his household. The tobacco, San Pedro, is believed to
have powerful magical and remedial values. The cross indicates
a crossing of the ways, an intersection of existential paths,
a change, as well as being the religious symbol of crucifixion
and resurrection. The shaman tells him to choose. Still the man
refuses. You don't give the orders, says the medicine man intent
upon evoking the patient's other self in order to bring him back
to life, the I who is another. Whether you want to or not, you
are going to receive your diploma, he says, to incite him with
the prospect of award and reputation. Living in an oral culture
without writing, where the acquisition of skills is traditional,
handed down from father to son, mother to daughters rather than
contained in books, for the Mazatecs wisdom is gained during the
experiences produced by the mushrooms: they are experiences of
vision and communication that impart knowledge.
<P>
Now he is spoken to. The inner voice is suddenly audible. He hears
the call. He is told to accept the vocation of medicine man that
he has hitherto adamantly. refused. He cannot recognize this voice
as his own, it must be another's; and the shaman, intent upon
giving him a new destiny, sure of the talent he has divined, interprets
for him from what region of himself springs the command he has
heard. It is your father who is telling you to accept this work.
A characteristic of such transcendental experiences is that family
relationships, in the nexus of which personality is formed, become
present to one with intense vividness. His superego, in conjunction
with the liberation of his vitality, has spoken to him and his
resistance is liquidated; he decides to live and accepts the new
vocation around which his personality is reintegrated: he becomes
an adept of the dimensions of consciousness where live the spirits;
a speaker of mighty words.
<P>
In his house, we entered a room with bare concrete walls and a
high roof of corrugated iron. His wife, wrapped in shawls, was
sitting on a mat. His children were there; his family had assembled
to eat the mushrooms with their father; one or two were given
to the children of ten and twelve. The window was closed and with
the door shut, the room was sealed off from the outside world;
nobody would be permitted to leave until the effect of what they
had eaten had passed away as a precaution against the peril of
derangement. He was a short, burly man, dressed in a reefer jacket
over a tee shirt, old brown bell-bottomed pants down to his short
feet, an empty cartridge belt around his waist. In daily life,
he is the owner of a little store stocked meagerly with canned
goods, boxes of crackers, beer, soda, candy, bread, and soap.
He sits behind the counter throughout the day looking out upon
the muddy street of the town where dogs prowl in the garbage between
the legs of the passers-by. From time to time he pours out a shot
glass of cane liquor for a customer. He himself neither smokes
nor drinks. He is a hunter in whom the instincts of his people
survive from the time when they were chasers of game as well as
agriculturalists: inhabitants of the Land of the Deer.
<P>
Now it is night-time and he prepares to exercise his shamanistic
function. His great- grandfather was one of the counselors of
the town and a medicine man. With the advent of modern medicine
and the invasion of the foreigners in search of mushrooms, the
shamanistic customs of the Mazatecs have almost completely vanished.
He himself no longer believes many of the beliefs of his ancestors,
but as one of the last oral poets of his people, he consciously
keeps alive their traditions. &quot;How good it is,&quot; he says,
&quot;to talk as the ancients did.&quot; He hardly speaks Spanish
and is fluent only in his native language. Spreading out the mushrooms
in front of him, he selected and handed a bunch of them to each
of those present after blessing them in the smoke of the copal.
Once they had been eaten, the lights were extinguished and everyone
sat in silence. Then he began to speak, seated in a chair from
which he got up to dance about, whirling and scuffling as he spoke
in the darkness. It was pouring, the rain thundering on the roof
of corrugated iron. There were claps of thunder. Flashes of lightning
at the window.

<P>
One who eats the mushroom sinks into somnolence during the transition
from one modality of consciousness to another, into a deep absorption,
a reverie. Gradually colors begin to well up behind closed eyes.
Consciousness becomes consciousness of irradiations and effulgences,
of a flux of light patterns forming and unforming, of electric
currents beaming forth from within the brain. At this initial
moment of awakenment, experiencing the dawn of light in the midst
of the night, the shaman evokes the illumination of the constellations
at the genesis of the world. Mythopoetical descriptions of the
creation of the world are constant themes of these creative experiences.
From the beginning, the vision his words create is cosmological.
Subjective phenomena are given correlates in the elemental, natural
world. One is not inside, but outside.

&quot;This old hawk. This white hawk that Saint John the Evangelist
holds. That whistles in the dawn. Whistles in the light of day.
Whistles over the water.&quot; Wings spread wide, the annunciatory
bird, image of ascent, circles in the sky of the morning, drifting
on the wind of the spirit above the primordial terrain the speaker
has begun to explore and delineate, his breathing, his inhalations
and exhalations, as amplified as his expanded being: an explanation
for the sudden expulsion of air, the whooshes and high-pitched,
eerie whistles of the shamans on their transcendental flights
into the beyond.
<P>
&quot;Straight path, says. Path of the dawn, says. Path of the
light of day, says.&quot; Through the fields of being there are
many directions in which to go, existences are different ways
to live life. The idea of paths, that appears so frequently in
the shamanistic discourses of the Mazatecs comes from the fact
that these originary experiences are creative of intentions. To
be in movement, going along a path, is an expressive vision of
the ecstatic condition. The path the speaker is following is thatwhich leads directly to his destination, to the accomplishment
of his purpose; the path of the beginning disclosed by the rising
sun at the time of setting out; the path of truth, of clarity,
of that revealed in its being there by the light of day.

to name the towns of his mountainous environment, to call the
landscape into being by language and transform the real into signs.
It is no imaginary world of fantasy he is creating, as those one
has become accustomed to hearing of from the accounts of dreamers
under the effects of such psychoactive chemicals, fabled lands
of nostalgia, palaces, and jeweled perspectives, but the real
world in which he lives and works transfigured by his visionary
journey and its linguistic expression into a surreal realm where
the physical and the mental fuse to produce the glow of an enigmatic
significance.

&quot;I am he who speaks with the father mountain. I am he who
speaks with danger, I am going to sweep in the mountains of fear,
in the mountains of nerves.&quot; The other I announces itself,
the transcendental ego, the I of the voice, the I of force in
communication with force. His existence intensified, he posits
himself by his assertions: I am he who. The simultaneous reference
to himself in the first and third person as subject and object
indicates the impersonal personality of his utterances, uttered
by him and by the phenomena themselves that express themselves
through him. Arrogantly he affirms his shamanistic function as
the mediator between man and the powers that determine his fate;
he is the one who converses with all connoted by father: power,
authority, and origin. He is the one who is on familiar terms
with the sources of fright. The conception of existence manifested
by his words is one of peril, anxiety, and terror: experiences
of which he has become knowledgeable by virtue of his own traumas,
his life as a hunter, and his adventures into the weird, secret
regions of the psyche. Where there is foreboding and trembling,
the medicine man tranquilizes by exorcising the causes of disturbance.
His work lies among the nerves, not in the underworld, but on
the heights, places of as much anguish as the depths, where the
elation of elevation is accompanied by the fear of falling into
the void of chasms. This is perhaps why, throughout Central and
South America, the conception of illness in the jungle areas is
the paranoic one of witchcraft, whereas in the mountainous areas
is prevalent the vertiginous idea of fright and loss of self.

&quot;There in Bell Mountain, says. There is the dirty fright.
There is the garbage, says. There is the claw, says. There is
the terror, says. Where the day is, says. Where the clown is,
says. The Lord Clown, says.&quot; In vision he sees, throughout
his being he senses a repulsive place of filth and contamination,
a stinking site of pustulence, of rottenness and nausea, where
lies a claw that might have dealt with cruel viciousness an infected
wound. His words, emanating evil, seem to insinuate some horrible
deed that left an aftermath of guilt. The sinister hovers in the
air. Where? Where the clown is, he says. Concern and carefreeness
are linked together, dread and laughter, from which we catch an
insight into the meaning of the matter: during such experiences
of liberation, there are likely to be encountered disturbances
of consciousness by conscience, when reflection comes into conflict
with spontaneity, guilt with innocence. It is as if the self drew
back in fright from its ebullience, from its forgetfulness, unable
to endure its carefreeness for long without anxiety. But the exuberant
welling up of forms is ceaseless, in this flux, this fountain,
this energetic springing forth of life, the past is left behind
for the future, all is renewed. Beyond good and evil is the playfulness
of the creative spirit incarnated by the clown, character of fortuity,
the laughing one with his gay science.

The enumeration, by what seems to be a process of free association,
of whirlwinds, clowns, personalities, lights, mountains, birds,
and stars, is an expression of his ecstatic inventiveness. Whether
he says what he sees or sees what he says, his activized consciousness
is a whirlwind of imaginings and colored lights. Why always thirteen?
Because twelve is many, but an even number, whereas thirteen is
too many, an exaggeration, and signifies a multitude. What's more,
he probably likes the sound of the word thirteen.
<P>
The mushroom session of language creates language, creates the
words for phenomena without name. The white lights that sometimes
appear in the sky at night, nobody knows what to call them. The
mind activated by the mushrooms, from out of the center of the
mystery, from the profoundest semantic sources of the human, invents
a word to designate them by. The ancient wise men, to describe
the kaleidoscopic illuminations of their shamanistic nights, drew
an analogy between the inside and the outside and formed a word
that related the spectrum colors created by the sunshine in the
spray of waterfalls and the mists of the morning to their conscious
experiences of ecstatic enlightenment: these are the whirlwinds
he speaks of, gyrating configurations of iridescent lights that
appear to him as he speaks, turned round and round and round himself
by the turbulent winds of the spirit. Clowns are frequent personae
of his discourse, the impish mushrooms come to life, embodiments
of merriment, tumbling figments of the spontaneous performing
incredible acrobatic feats, funny imaginations of joyfulness.
Personalities are more serious. Others. Society. The faces of
the people he knows appear to him, then disappear to be succeeded
by the apparition of more people. The plurality of incarnated
consciousnesses becomes present to him. Multitude. His is an elemental
world where cruel, predatory birds wheel in the sky; where the
star of the morning shines in the firmament. Outside the dark
room where he is speaking, the mountains stand all around in the
night.

<P>
It is significant that though the psychedelic experience produced
by the mushrooms is of heightened perceptivity, the I say is of
privileged importance to the I see. The utter darkness of the
room, sealed off from the outside, makes any direct perception
of the world impossible: the condition of interiorization for
its visionary rebirth in images. In such darkness, to open the
eyes is the same as leaving them closed. The blackness is alive
with impalpable designs in the miraculous air. Even the appearances
of the other presences, out of modesty, are protected by the obscurity
from the too penetrating, revealing gaze of transcendental perception.
Freed from the factuality of the given, the constitutive activity
of consciousness produces visions. It is this aspect of such experiences,
to the exclusion of all others, that has led them to be called
hallucinogenic, without any attempt having been made to distinguish
fantasy from intuition. The Mazatec shaman, however, instead of
keeping silent and dreaming, as one would expect him to do if
the experience were merely imaginative, talks. There are times
when in the midst of his ecstasy, whistling and whirling about,
he exclaims: &quot;Look at how beautiful we're seeing!&quot;-astonished
by the illuminations and patterns he is perceiving-&quot;Look
at how beautiful we're seeing. Look at how many good things of
God there are. What beautiful colors I see.&quot; Nevertheless,

the Mazatecs, the mountains are where the powers are, their summits,
their ranges, radiating with electricity in the night, their peaks
and their edges oscillating on the horizons of lightning. To speak
with is to be in contact with, in communication with, in conversation
with the animate spirit of the inanimate, with the material and
the immaterial. To speak with is to be spoken to. By a conversion
of his being, the shaman has become a transmitter and receiver
of messages.

The shaman, says Alfred Metraux, is &quot;an individual who, in
the interest of the community, sustains by profession an intermittent
commerce with the spirits or is possessed by them.&quot; <A HREF="#footnote9">(9)</A>
According to the classical conception, derived from the ecstatic
visionaries of Siberia, the shaman is a person who, by a change
of his everyday consciousness, enters the metaphysical realms
of the transcendental in order to parley with the supernatural
powers and gain an understanding of the hidden reasons of events,
of sickness and all manner of difficulty. The Mazatec medicine
men are therefore shamans in every sense of the word: their means
of inspiration, of opening the circuits of communication between
themselves, others, the world, and the spirits, are the mushrooms
that disclose, by their psychoactive power, another modality of
conscious activity than the ordinary one. The mere eating of the
mushrooms, however, does not make a shaman. The Indians recognize
that it is not to everyone that they speak; instead there are
some who have a longing for awakenment, a disposition for exploring
the surrealistic dimensions of existence, a poet's need to express
themselves in a higher language than the average language of everyday
life: for them in a very particular sense the mushrooms are the
medicine of their genius. Nonetheless, there is a very definite
idea among the Mazatecs of what the medicine man does, and since
the mushrooms are his means of converting himself into the shamanistic
condition, the essential characteristics of this particular variety
of psychedelic experience must be manifested by his activities.
<P>
&quot;I am he who puts together,&quot; says the medicine man to
define his shamanistic function:

I am he who fixes, he who cures the person that is sick. Herbal

day, says. I am he who resolves all, says. Truly you are man enough
to resolve the truth. You are he who puts together and resolves.
You are he who puts together the personality. You are he who speaks
with the light of day. You are he who speaks with terror.

<P>
It is immediately obvious that a discrepancy exists between the
Indian conception of the mushrooms' effect and the ideas of modern
psychology: whereas in experimental research reports they are
said to produce depersonalization, schizophrenia, and derangement,
the Mazatec shaman, inspired by them, considers himself endowed
with the power of bringing together what is separated: he can
heal the divided personality by releasing the springs of existence
from repression to reveal the ecstatic life of the integral self;
and from disparate clues, by the sudden synthesis of intuition,
realize the solution to problems. The words with which he states
what his work is indicate a creative activity neither outside
of the realm of reason or out of contact with reality. The center
of convergent message fields, sensitive to the meaning of all
around him, he expresses and communicates, in direct contact with
others through speech, an articulator of the unsaid who liberates
by language and makes understood. His intuitions penetrate appearances
to the essence of matters. Reality reveals itself through him
in words as if it had found a voice to utter itself. The shaman
is a signifier in pursuit of significance, intent upon bringing
forth the hidden, the obscure into the light of day, the lucid
one, intrepid enough to realize that the greatest secrets lie
in regions of danger. He is the doctor, not only of the body,
but of the self, the one who inquires into the origins of trauma,
the interrogator of the familiar and mysterious. It is indeed
as if that which he has eaten, by virtue of the possibilities
it discovers to him, were of the spirit, for perception becomes
more acute, speech more fluent, and the consciousness of significance
is quickened. The mushrooms are a remedy to which one has recourse
in order to resolve perplexities because the experience is creative
of intentions. The way forth from the problematic is conceived
of, the meaning of resolved. The shaman, he is the one in communication
with the light and with the darkness, who knows of anxiety and
how to dispel it: the man of truth, psychologist of the troubled
soul.

<P>
Once more there appears the notion of alienation, the malady of
fright, the loss of the self. The task of the shaman, hunter of
extravagated spirits, is to reassociate the disassociated. He
explains his method himself in these words:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under the effect of the mushrooms, the lost spirit is whistled
for through space for the spirit is alienated, but by means of
the mushrooms one can call for it with a whistle. If the person
is frightened, the mushrooms know where his spirit is. They are
the ones who indicate and teach where the spirit is. Thereby one
can speak to it. The sick person then sees the place where his
spirit stayed. He feels as if he were tied in that place. The
spirit is like a trapped butterfly. When it is whistled for it
arrives where one is calling it. When the spirit arrives in the
person, the sick one sighs and afterwards is cleaned.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It becomes evident from the words used to describe the condition
of fright-the spirit is said to have been left behind, to have
stayed somewhere, to be tied up, and as we will see later, to
be imprisoned-that just as in the etiology of the neuroses, the
sickness is a fixation upon a traumatic past event which the individual
is incapable of transcending and from which he must be liberated
to be cured. It is not by chance that the mushrooms, which cause
a flight of the spirit, should be considered the means of chasing
what has flown away. The shaman goes in search; by empathic imagination,
sometimes even by dialogue with the disturbed one, he gains an
insight into the reasons for the state of shock, which allows
him to make his invocations relevant to the individual case. The
patient, by the mnemonic power of the mushrooms, freed from inhibitions
and repressions, recalls the traumatic event, surmounts the repetition
syndrome that perpetuates it by virtue of the ecstatic spontaneity
that has been released from him, suffers a catharsis, and is brought
back to life, integrated again.
<P>
Another method of regaining the lost spirit, used as well as invocation,
is to barter for it. Merchants, the Mazatecs conceive of all transactions
in terms of commerce, of trading one value for another. Throughout
his discourse, the shamans a storekeeper in daily life, dreams
of money, of richness, of freedom from poverty. &quot;Father Bank.
Big Bank. Where the light of day is. Cordoba. Orizaba.&quot; He
names the cities where the merchants of Huautla sell their principal
commercial crop-coffee-in the market. &quot;Where the Superior
Bank is, says. Where the Big Bank is, says. Where the Good Bank
is, says. Where there is money of gold, says. Where there is money
of silver, says. Where there are big notes, says. Where the bank
of gold is, says. Where the bank of well-being is, says.&quot;
It is not surprising that among such mercantile people it should
be considered possible to buy back the lost spirit, to retrieve
it in exchange for another value.
<P>
&quot;Where the fright of the spirit is. Going to pay for it to
the spirit. Going to pay the day. Going to pay the mountains.
Going to pay the corners.&quot; The shaman becomes a transcendental
bargainer. He is told by the supernatural powers how much they
demand as a ransom for the spirit they have expropriated, then
he undertakes to transact the deal. He explains it himself in
this way:
<P>
Cacao is used to pay the mountain and to pay for the life of the
sick one. The Lord of the Mountain asks for a chicken. This is
an important matter because it is the Masters of the Mountains
who speak. That is the belief of the ancients. The chicken is
the one who has to carry the cacao. Loaded with cacao it has to
go and leave the offering in the mountain. Once it is on the mountain,
seeing it loaded no one bothers to catch it because already it
belongs to the Masters of the Mountain where it is lost forever.
The cacao that it carries is money for the Master of the Mountain.
The bark paper is used to wrap the bundle and the parrot feather
that goes with it. The signification of the parrot feather is
that it is as if the parrot himself arrived on the mountain. It
is he who arrives announcing with his songs the arrival of the
chicken loaded with cacao, the arrival of the money to pay what
was asked for, as if the liberty of a prisoner were being paid
for. It is as if an authority said to you, &quot;This prisoner
will be set free for a fine of one hundred pesos and if it isn't
paid, he won't go free.&quot; The transaction probably has the
psychological effect of assuaging anxiety with the assurance that
the powers angered by a transgression have been appeased.
<P>
As we have seen, though these shamanistic chants are creations
of language created by the individual creativity of the speakers,
the structure of the discourses, short phrases articulated in
succession terminated by the punctuation of the word says, tend
to be similar from person to person, determined to a large extent
by culture and tradition as is much of what is said. An instance
is the invocatory reiteration of names, a characteristic common
to all the Mazatec shamanistic sessions of speech. The names repeated
by the Indian medicine men, devout Catholics, are those of the
Virgin and the saints. In ancient times, other divinities must
have been named, but without any doubt, to name and make present
has always played a role in such chants. &quot;Holy Virgin of
the Sanctuary. Holy Virgin. Saint Bartholomew. Saint Christopher.
Saint Manuel. Holy Father. Saint Vincent. Saint Mark. Saint Manuel.
Virgin Guadalupe, Queen of Mexico.&quot; To sing out the holy
names serves the function for the oral poet, like the stereotyped
phrases of Homeric song, of keeping the chant going during the
interludes of inspiration; at the same time, the rhythmic enunciation
is a telling over of identities, an expression of the interpersonality
of consciousness. To recall again the affirmation of Husserl:
Transcendental subjectivity is intersubjectivity. The name is
the word for the person. In the mind of the speaker one identity
after another becomes present, names call up people, the vision
of people calls up names. Instead of naming his own acquaintances,
which might occur in a desacralized discourse, the shaman invokes
the holy ones. The sacred nomenclature is a sublimation of the
nomenclature of family and social relationships.
<P>
It is now his everyday self, his wife and his family whom he speaks
about. &quot;Our children are going to grow up and live. I see.
I see my wife, my little working woman. I love her. I speak to
her through space. I speak to her through the cumulus clouds.
I call to her spirit. Nothing will befall us.&quot; Man and woman,
the couple and their children, that is his theme now that love
for his family wells up in his heart.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Nothing can happen to us. We will go on living. We will go on
living in the company of my wife, of my people. We should not
make our wife irritable. We went to receive her before God, in
the sight of God, in the Sacred Sacrament, in sight of the altar.
There was a great mass, there was a mass of union. We were able
to respect each other forty-three days and therefore God disposed
that our children should be born and live. Because of that our
seeds bore fruit, our offspring grew, offspring and seed that
God Our Lord gave us.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
He who speaks and says, perhaps it is rumored that the work he
is doing, this person, is great, that his ranch is large. He is
not presumptuous. He is a humble person. He is a laborious person.
He is a person of problems. He is a person who has al ready loaned
his service as an authority. He has realized himself, his gifts
are inherited, he is of important people: Justo Pastor, Juan Nazareno.
He is of a great root, an important root. Large trees, old trees.
All our children will live, says. Will have a good harvest. Will
rear their animals. Well-being and pleasure in their sugar cane,
in their coffee groves. I will live much time yet. I will become
an old man with gray hair, I will continue living with my offspring
and with my people. My children will have education and well-being.
Education must be given to my sons.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
He says the changes through which he passes, the transformations
and permutations of his ecstatic consciousness in the course of
its temporalization-the sense of gamble, the risks, the moments
of fright, the presence of light and vigor. &quot;It turns into
a game of chance, says. It turns into terror, says. It turns into
spirit, says.&quot;
<P>
He whistles and sings and dances about. &quot;That which sounds
is a harp in the presence of God and the Angel of the Guard. Plays
space, plays the rocks, plays the mountains, plays the corners,
plays fear, plays terror, plays the day.&quot; He plays the facets
of the world as if they were musical instruments. Things and emotions,
at the contact of his singing and touch are magically resolved
into ringing vibrating tonalities, into music-music of mountains
and rocks, of space and fear. &quot;Where sound the trees, says.
Where sound the rocks, says. Where sound baskets. Where sounds
the spirit of the day.&quot; He is hearing the ringing and the
buzzing and the humming of his effervescent consciousness and
finding analogies for the sounds he hears in the echo chambers
of his eardrums: the soughing of the wind through the trees, the
clinking of stones, the creaking of baskets. He whistles and sings.
His words issue forth from the melodic articulation of inarticulate
sounds, from the physical movement of his rhythmic whirling about
and scuffling in the darkness. &quot;How beautiful I sing,&quot;
he exclaims. &quot;How beautiful I sing. How many good pleasures
concedes to us the Lord of the World.&quot; He dances about working
himself up to a further pitch of exaltation. &quot;How beautiful
I dance. How beautiful I dance.&quot; Repetition is one of the
aspects of the discourse as it is of the pulsation of energy waves.
<P>
&quot;This person is valiant,&quot; he says of himself. &quot;He
is of the people of Huautla, he is a Huautecan. With great speed
he calls and whistles for the spirits among the mountains; whistles
the fright of the spirit.&quot; Then he flips out. He throws himself
into the shamanistic fit, his voice changes, becomes that of another,
rougher, more guttural, and beginning to speak in the speech of
San Lucas from where came his old master, a town in the midst
of the corn on a high windswept peak, he recalls his spiritual
ancestor, the ancient wise man who taught him the use of the gnomic
mushrooms. &quot;He is a person of jars. He is of San Lucas. A
person of plates. He is a person of jars and bowls. He is an old
one.&quot; San Lucas is the place where all the black, unadorned,
neolithic pottery used throughout the region is made. Men go from
town to town carrying the jars, padded with ferns, on their backs
to sell them in the marketplaces of the mountain villages. &quot;Old
man of pots, dishes, bowls. These are the people of the center.
They speak with the mountains arrogantly. He is from San Lucas.
He speaks with the whirlwind, with the whirlwind of the interior.&quot;
<P>
From what he himself tells of this old shaman, appear vestiges
of the days when the shaman of the People of the Deer, intermediary
between man, nature, and the divine was a thaumaturge who presided
over fertility and the hunt. &quot;I had to visit the same medicine
man,&quot; he recounts, &quot;when we went to the hunt. I had
to prepare for him an egg, an egg to be offered to the mountain.
It all depends on the value of the animal that one wants. It is
as if you were going to buy an animal,&quot; he said.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
He is the one who says what one is to pay. He goes to leave the
egg. Afterwards the dogs go into the woods and begin to work.
It is necessary to rub tobacco on the crown of the dogs' heads.
But with the egg and twenty-five beans of cacao, the master is
sure that the deer is already bought. I have paid for the game,
says the true shaman. And every time we went to hunt, we were
therefore sure to encounter deer because a good shaman from San
Lucas can transform a tree or a stone into a deer once he has
exchanged its value for it with the Lord of the Mountain. We were
sure to come upon deer because they had been paid for.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&quot;Here come the Huautecans. Here come the Huautecans.&quot;
Dancing about in the darkness, flapping his coat against his sides
to imitate the bounding of a startled deer through the underbrush,
he, the hunter of spirits and of game, barking like the dogs closing
in around the cornered animal, tells a hunting story, talking
rapidly with intense excitement in the gruff voice of one from
San Lucas who sees from his vantage point the hunters of Huautla
in the distance:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Listen to how their dogs bark. It's an old dog. Here they come
by way of the Sad Mountain. They are bringing their kill. There
is barking in the mountain. Here they come. Listen to how their
arms sound. Already they have shot a colored deer. They pay the
mountains. They pay the corners. The deer was killed because the
Huautecans pay the price. They paid the spirit. Paid the Bald
Mountain. Paid the Hollow Mountain. Paid the Mountain of the Spirit
of the Day. Paid fifty pesos. You can't do just as you like. It
is necessary to pay the White Gnome. The Huautecans are like clowns.
They are carrying the deer off along the path. The rifles of the
Huautecans are very fine. These people are important people. They
know what they are doing. They know how to call the spirit. The
Huautecans call their dogs by blowing a horn. Already the dogs
are coming close.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The story comes almost at the conclusion of his discourse. The
effect of the mushrooms lasts approximately six hours; usually
it is impossible to sleep until dawn. In all such adventures,
at the end, comes the idea of a return from where it is one has
gone, the return to everyday consciousness. &quot;I return to
collect these holy children that served as a remedy,&quot; the
shaman says, calling back his spirits from their flight into the
beyond in order to become his ordinary self again. &quot;Aged
clowns. White clowns.&quot; The mushrooms he calls sainted children
and clowns, relating them by his personifications to beings who
are young and joyful, playful, creative, and wise.
<P>
&quot;The aurora of the dawn is coming and the light of day. In
the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, by the sign
of the Holy Cross, free us Our Lord from our enemies and all evil.
Amen.&quot;
<P>
What began in the depths of the night with the illumination of
interior constellations in the spaces of consciousness ends with
the arrival of the daylight after a night of continuous, animated
speech. &quot;I am he who speaks,&quot; says the Mazatec shaman.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am he who speaks. I am he who speaks with the mountains. I am
he who speaks with the corners. I am the doctor. I am the man
of medicines. I am. I am he who cures. I am he who speaks with
the Lord of the World. I am happy. I speak with the mountains.
I am he who speaks with the mountains of peaks. I am he who speaks
with the Bald Mountain. I am the remedy and the medicine man.
I am the mushroom. I am the fresh mushroom. I am the large mushroom.
I am the fragrant mushroom. I am the mushroom of the spirit.<A NAME="back10"></A>

<P>
The Mazatecs say that the mushrooms speak. Now the investigators
<A HREF="#footnote10">(10)</A> from without should have listened
better to the Indian wise men who had experience of what they,
white ones of reason, had not. If the mushrooms are hallucinogenic,
why do the Indians associate them with communication, with truth
and the enunciation of meaning? An hallucination is a false perception,
either visual or audible, that does not have any relation at all
to reality, a fantastical illusion or delusion: what appears,
but has no existence except in the mind. The vivid dreams of the
psychedelic experience suggested hallucinations: such imaginations
do occur in these visionary conditions, but they are marginal,
not essential phenomena of a general liberation of the spontaneous,
ecstatic, creative activity of conscious existence. Hallucinations
predominated in the experiences of the investigators because they
were passive experimenters of the transformative effect of the
mushrooms. The Indian shamans are not contemplative, they are
workers who actively express themselves by speaking, creators
engaged in an endeavor of ontological, existential disclosure.
For them, the shamanistic condition provoked by the mushrooms
is intuitionary, not hallucinatory. What one envisions has an
ethical relation to reality, is indeed often the path to be followed.
To see is to realize, to understand. But even more important than
visions for the Mazatec shaman are words as real as the realities
of the real they utter. It is as if the mushrooms revealed a primordial
activity of signification, for once the shaman has eaten them,
he begins to speak and continues to speak throughout the shamanistic
session of ecstatic language. The phenomenon most distinctive
of the mushrooms' effect is the inspired capacity to speak. Those
who eat them are men of language, illuminated with the spirit,
who call themselves the ones who speak, those who say. The shaman,
chanting in a melodic singsong, saying says at the end of each
phrase of saying, is in communication with the origins of creation,
the sources of the voice, and the fountains of the word, related
to reality from the heart of his existential ecstasy by the active
mediation of language: the articulation of meaning and experience.
To call such transcendental experiences of light, vision, and
speech hallucinatory is to deny that they are revelatory of reality.
In the ancient codices, the colored books, the figures sit, hieroglyphs
of words, holding the mushrooms of language in pairs in their
hands: signs of signification.<P><HR WIDTH=50%>

<A NAME="footnote2"></A>(2). The inspiration produced by the mushrooms
is very much like that described by Nietzsche in <I>Ecce Homo</I>.
Since the statement of Rimbaud, &quot;I is another,&quot; spontaneous
language, speaking or writing as if from dictation (to use the
common expression for an activity very difficult to describe in
its truth) has been of paramount interest to philosophers and
poets. Sap the Mexican, Octavio Paz, in an essay on Breton, &quot;The
inspired one, the man who in truth speaks, does not say anything
that is his: from his mouth speaks language.&quot; Octavio Paz,
&quot;Andre Breton o La Busqueda del Comienzo,&quot; <I>Corriente

(3). The shamanistic discourses studied in this essay, were tape-recorded.
I am indebted for the translations to a bilingual woman of Huautla,
Mrs. Eloina Estrada de Gonzalez, who listened to the recordings
and told me, phrase by phrase, in Spanish, what the shaman and
shamaness were saying in their native language. As far as I know,
the words of neither of these oral poets have hitherto been published.
They are Mrs. Irene Pineda de Figueroa and Mr. Roman Estrada.
The complete text of each discourse takes up ninety-two pages.
For the purposes of this essay, I have merely selected the most
representative passages. <A HREF="#back3">(Back)</A> <A NAME="footnote4"></A>

(4). &quot;. . . the Greek word which signifies poetry was employed
by the writer of an alchemical papyrus to designate the operation
of 'transmutation' itself. What a ray of light! One knows that
the word 'poetry' comes from the Greek verb which signifies 'make.'
But that does not designate an ordinary fabrication except for
those who reduce it to verbal nonsense. For those who have conserved
the sense of the poetic mystery, poetry is a sacred action. That
is to say, one which exceeds the ordinary level of human action.
Like alchemy, its intention is to associate itself with the mystery
of the 'primordial creation' . . .&quot; Michel Carrouges, <I>Andre

the restitution of a power of signification, a birth of sense

(7). The story of how he began his shamanistic career, together
with the information to follow about fright, payments to the mountains,
and practices in relation to the hunt, are quotations from an
interview with Mr. Roman Estrada whom I questioned through an
interpreter: the conversation was tape-recorded and then translated
from the native language by Mrs. Eloina Estrada de Gonzalez, the
niece of the shaman, who served as questioner in the interview
itself. <A HREF="#back7">(Back)</A> <A NAME="footnote8"></A>

(10). It is necessary to express one's debt to R. Gordon Wasson,
whose writings, the most authoritative work on the mushrooms,
informed me of their existence and told me much about them. &quot;We
suspect,&quot; he wrote, &quot;that, in its integral sense, the
creative power, the most serious quality distinctive of man and
one of the clearest participations in the Divine . . . is in some
sort connected with an area of the spirit that the mushrooms are
capable of opening.&quot; R. Gordon Wasson and Roger Heim, <I>Les
Champignons halhlcinogenes du Mexique</I> (Paris: Museum National
d'Histoire Naturelle, 1958). From my own experience, I have found
that contention to be particularly true. <A HREF="#back10">(Back)</A>

an excerpt from<BR>&quot;A Review of the Clinical Effects of Psychotomimetic
Agents&quot;<BR><I>Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci.</I>, March 14, 1957.</CENTER><HR>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Our interest [in psychotomimetic drugs], so far, has been psychiatric and pathological, with
only a hint that any other viewpoint is possible; yet our predecessors
were interested in these things from quite different points of
view. In the perspective of history, our psychiatric and pathological
bias is the unusual one. By means of a variety of techniques,
from dervish dancing to prayerful contemplation, from solitary
confinement in darkness to sniffing the carbonated air at the
Delphic oracle, from chewing peyote to prolonged starvation, men
have pursued, down the centuries, certain experiences that they
considered valuable above all others.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The great William James endured much uncalled-for criticism for
suggesting that in some people inhalations of nitrous oxide allowed
a psychic disposition that is always potentially present to manifest
itself briefly. Has our comparative neglect of these experiences,
recognized by James and Bergson as being of great value, rendered
psychology stale and savorless? Our preoccupation with behavior,
because it is measurable, has led us to assume that what can be
measured must be valuable and vice versa. During the twentieth
century we have seen, except for a few notables such as Carl Jung,
an abandoning of the psyche by psychologists and psychiatrists.
Recently they have been joined by certain philosophers. Pavlov,
Binet, Freud, and a host of distinguished followers legitimately
limited the field to fit their requirements, but later expanded
their formulations from a limited inquiry to embrace the whole
of existence. An emphasis on the measurable and the reductive
has resulted in the limitation of interest by psychiatrists and
psychologists to aspects of experience that fit in with this concept.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There was and is another stream of psychological thought in Europe
and in the United States that is more suitable for the work that
I shall discuss next. James, in the United States, Sedgwick, Myers,
and Gurney in Britain, and Carl Jung in Switzerland are among
its great figures. Bergson is its philosopher and Harrison its
prophet. These and many others have said that in this work, as
in any other, science is applicable if one defines it in Dingle's
term, &quot;the rational ordering of the facts of experience.&quot;
We must not fall into the pitfall of supposing that any explanation,
however, ingenious, can be a substitute for observation and experiment.
The experience must be there before the rational ordering.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Work on the potentialities of mescaline and the rest of these
agents fell on the stony ground of behaviorism and doctrinaire
psychoanalysis. Over the years we have been deluged with explanations,
while observation has become less sharp. This will doubtless continue
to be the case as long as the observer and the observed do not
realize that splendor, terror, wonder, and beauty, far from being
the epiphenomena of &quot;objective&quot; happenings, may be of
central importance.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Accounts of the effect of these agents, ranging in time from that
of Havelock Ellis in 1897 to the more recent reports of Aldous
Huxley are many, and they emphasize the unique quality of the
experience. One or more sensory modalities combined with mood,
thinking and, often to a marked degree, empathy, usually change.
Most subjects find the experience valuable, some find it frightening,
and many say that it is uniquely lovely. All, from Slotkin's unsophisticated
Indians to men of great learning, agree that much of it is beyond
verbal description. Our subjects, who include many who have drunk
deep of life, including authors, artists, a junior cabinet minister,
scientists, a hero, philosophers, and businessmen, are nearly
all in agreement in this respect. For myself, my experiences with
these substances have been the most strange, most awesome, and
among the most beautiful things in a varied and fortunate life.
These are not escapes from but enlargements, burgeonings of reality.
Insofar as I can judge they occur in violation of Hughlings Jackson's
principle, because the brain, although its functioning is impaired,
acts more subtly and complexly than when it is normal. Yet surely,
when poisoned, the brain's actions should be less complex, rather
than more so! I cannot argue about this because one must undergo
the experience himself. Those who have had these experiences know,
and those who have not had them cannot know and, what is more,
the latter are in no position to offer a useful explanation.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Is this phenomenon of chemically induced mental aberration something
wholly new? It is not, as I have suggested earlier. It has been
sought and studied since the earliest times and has played a notable
part in the development of religion, art, philosophy, and even
science. Systems such as yoga have sprung from it. Enormous effort
has been expended to induce these states easily so as to put them
to use. Although occasionally trivial and sometimes frightening,
their like seems to have been at least part of the experience
of visionaries and mystics the world over. These states deserve
thought and pondering because until we understand them no account
of the mind can be accurate. It is foolish to expect a single
exploration to bring back as much information as twenty of them.
It is equally foolish to expect an untrained, inept, or sick person
to play the combined part of observer, experienced and recorder
as well as a trained and skilled individual. Those who have no
taste for this work can help by freely admitting their shortcomings
rather than disguising them by some imposing ascription.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This may seem mere nonsense but, before closing his mind, the
reader should reflect that something unusual ought to seem irrational
because it transcends those fashionable ruts of thinking that
we dignify by calling them logic and reason. We prefer such rationalized
explanations because they provide an illusory sense of predictability.
Little harm is done so long as we do not let our sybaritism blind
us to the primacy of experience. especially in psychology.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Psychoanalysts claim that their ideas cannot be fully understood
without a personal analysis. Not everyone accepts this claim,
but can one ever understand something one has never done? A eunuch
could write an authoritative book on sexual behavior, but a book
on sexual experience by the same author would inspire less confidence.
Working with these substances, as in psychoanalysis, we must often
be our own instruments.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Psychoanalysis resembles Galileo's telescope, which lets one see
a somewhat magnified image of an object the wrong way round and
upside down. The telescope changed our whole idea of the solar
system and revolutionized navigation. Psychotomimetic agents,
whose collective name is still undecided, are more like the radar
telescopes now being built to scan the deeps of outer, invisible
space. They are not convenient. One cannot go bird watching with
them. They explore a tiny portion of an enormous void. They raise
more questions than answers, and to understand those answers we
must invent new languages. What we learn is not reassuring or
even always comprehensible. Like astronomers, however, we must
change our thinking to use the potentialities of our new instruments.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Freud has told us much about many important matters. However,
I believe that he and his pupils tried illegitimately to extrapolate
from his data far beyond their proper limits in an attempt to
account for the whole of human endeavor and, beyond this, into
the nature of man and God. This was magnificent bravado. It is
not science, for it is as vain to use Freud's system for these
greatest questions as it is to search for the galaxies with Galileo's
hand telescope. Jung, using what I consider the very inadequate
tools of dream and myth, has shown such skill and dexterity that
he has penetrated as deep into these mysteries as his equipment
allows. Our newer instruments, employed with skill and reverence,
allow us to explore a greater range of experience more intensively.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There have always been risks in discovery. Splendid rashness such
as John Hunter's should be avoided, yet we must be prepared for
calculated risks such as those that Walter Reed and his colleagues
took in their conquest of yellow fever. The mind cannot be explored
by proxy. To deepen our understanding, not simply to great madnesses
but of the nature of mind itself, we must use our instruments
as coolly and boldly as those who force their aircraft through
other invisible barriers. Disaster may overtake the most skilled.
Today and in the past, for much lesser prizes, men have taken
much greater risks.<P>&nbsp;  <P>
<H4>How Should We Name Them?</H4>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
If mimicking mental illness were the main characteristic of these
agents, &quot;psychotomimetics&quot; would indeed be a suitable
generic term. It is true that they do so, but they do much more.
Why are we always preoccupied with the pathological, the negative?
Is health only the lack of sickness? Is good merely the absence
of evil? Is pathology the only yardstick? Must we ape Freud's
gloomier moods that persuaded him that a happy man is a self-deceiver
evading the heartache for which there is no anodyne? Is not a
child infinitely potential rather than polymorphously perverse?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
I have tried to find an appropriate name for the agents under
discussion: a name that will include the concepts of enriching
the mind and enlarging the vision. Some possibilities are: psychephoric,
mind moving; psychehormic, mind rousing; and psycheplastic, mind
molding. Psychezynic, mind fermenting, is indeed appropriate.
Psycherhexic, mind bursting forth, though difficult, is memorable.
Psychelytic, mind releasing, is satisfactory. My choice, because
it is clear, euphonious, and uncontaminated by other associations,
is psychedelic, mind manifesting. One of these terms should serve.
<P>&nbsp;  <P>
<H4>Epilogue</H4>
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This, then is how one clinician sees these psychedelics. I believe
that these agents have a part to play in our survival as a species,
for that survival depends as much on our opinion of our fellows
and ourselves as on any other single thing. The psychedelics help
us to explore and fathom our own nature.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
We can perceive ourselves as the stampings of an automatic socioeconomic
process, as highly plastic and conditionable animals, as congeries
of instinctive strivings ending in loss of sexual drive and death,
as cybernetic gadgets, or even as semantic conundrums. All of
these concepts have their supporters and they all have some degree
of truth in them. We may also be something more, &quot;a part
of the main,&quot; a striving sliver of a creative process, a
manifestation of Brahma in Atman, an aspect t of an infinite God
imminent and transcendent within and with; out us. These very
different valuings of the self and of other people's selves have
all been held sincerely by men and women. I expect that even what
seem the most extreme notions are held by some contributors to
these pages. Can one doubt that the views of the world derived
from such differing concepts are likely to differ greatly, and
that the courses of action determined by those views will differ?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Our briefs, what we assume, as the Ames demonstrations in perception<A NAME="back1"></A><A HREF="#footnote1">*</A>
show, greatly influence the world in which we live. That world
is in part, at least, what we make of it. Once our mold for world
making is formed it most strongly resists change. The psychedelics
allow us, for a little while, to divest ourselves of these acquired
assumptions and to see the universe again with an innocent eye.
In T. H. Huxley's words, we may, if we wish, &quot;sit down
in front of the facts like a child&quot; or as Thomas Traherne,
a seventeenth-century English mystic, puts it, &quot;to unlearn
the dirty devices of the world and become as it were a little
child again.&quot;<A NAME="back2"></A><A HREF="#footnote2">**</A>
Mystic and scientist have the same recipe for those who seek truth.
Perhaps, if we can do this, we shall learn how to rebuild our
world in another and better image, for the breakneck advance of
science is forcing change on us whether we like it or not. Our
old faults, however, persisting in our new edifice, are far more
dangerous to us than they were in the old structure. The old world
perishes and, unless we are to perish in its ruins, we must leave
our old assumptions to die with it. &quot;Let the dead bury their
dead&quot; tells us what we must do.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
While we are learning, we may hope that dogmatic religion and
authoritarian science will keep away from each other's throats.
We need not put out the visionary's eyes because we do not share
his vision. We need not shout down the voice of the mystic because
we cannot hear it, or force our rationalizations on him for our
own reassurance. Few of us can accept or understand the mind that
emerges from these studies. Kant once said of Swedenborg, &quot;Philosophy
is often much embarrassed when she encounters certain facts she
dare not doubt yet will not believe for fear of ridicule.&quot;
Sixty years ago orthodox physicists knew that the atom was incompressible
and indivisible. Only a few cranks doubted this. Yet who believes
in the billiard-ball atom now?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In a few years, I expect, the psychedelics that I have mentioned
will seem as crude as our ways of using them. Yet even though
many of them are gleanings from Stone Age peoples they can enlarge
our experience greatly. Whether we employ these substances for
good or ill, whether we use them with skill and deftness or with
blundering ineptitude depends not a little on the courage, intelligence,
and humanity of many of us who are working in the field today.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Recently I was asked by a senior colleague if this area of investigation
lies within the scope of science and, if it does not, should not
religion, philosophy, or politics take the responsibility for
it? But politics, philosophy, religion, and even art are dancing
more and more to the tune of science, and, as scientists, it is
our responsibility to see that our tune does not become a death
march, either physical or spiritual. We cannot evade our responsibilities.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
So far as I can judge, spontaneous experience of the kind we are
discussing has always been infrequent, and the techniques for
developing it are often faulty, uncertain, clumsy, objectionable,
and even dangerous. Our increasingly excellent physical health,
with the steady elimination of both acute and chronic infections,
the tranquilizers that enable us to neutralize unusual chemoelectrical
brain activity, our diet, rich in protein and, especially, B-complex
vitamins whose antagonism to LSD I have already discussed-all
of these, combined with a society whose whole emphasis is on material
possession in a brightly lit and brilliantly colored synthetic
world, will make spontaneous experiences of the sort I have mentioned
ever fewer. As we grow healthier and healthier, every millimeter
that we budge from an allotted norm will be checked.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
I believe that the psychedelics provide a chance, perhaps only
a slender one, for homo faber, the cunning, ruthless, foolhardy,
pleasure-greedy toolmaker to merge into that other creature whose
presence we have so rashly presumed, homo sapiens, the wise, the
understanding, the compassionate, in whose fourfold vision art,
politics science, and religion are one. Surely we must seize that
chance.<P><HR WIDTH=50%>

<h1>PSYCHEDELICS, TECHNOLOGY, PSYCHEDELICS </h1>
<h3>BERNARD S. AARONSON AND HUMPHRY OSMOND </h3>
<p>The Introduction to PSYCHEDELICS, The Uses and Implications of
Hallucinogenic Drugs, edited by Bernard Aaronson and Humphry
Osmond, Doubleday &amp; Company 1970. Copyright Aaronson and
Osmond. </p>
<hr>
<p>Any culture may be regarded as a ramification of a particular
technology applied to the particular set of local conditions
within which that culture is situated. The term
&quot;technology,&quot; as used here, refers to the entire set of
devices, whether mechanical, chemical, or linguistic, by which
adaptations of individuals to their environments are enhanced.
Plows, clubs, radios, airplanes, fertilizers, drugs, breakfast
cereals, grammars, and concepts are each implements and instances
of technology, which influence and are influenced by one another.
Some implements operate by directly altering the environment in
response to the demands of the individual, as when we turn on an
air conditioner on a hot day. Others operate by altering the
individual to meet the demands of the environment, as when we
&quot;make the last one for the road coffee.&quot; Still others
may attempt to integrate the two, as when we read a book to gain
knowledge that will help us in particular situations. </p>
<p>All systems of technology have certain common characteristics
in terms of how they affect those who use them. They set up ways
of looking at the world in terms of which new experiences can be
encoded. One of the best illustrations of this is given in an old
Jewish folk song in which the singing of a new cantor on the
Sabbath is heard by a tailor in terms of how one sews a suit of
clothes, by a cobbler in terms of making shoes, and by a
carpenter in terms of cutting wood. Systems of technology focus
attention on certain kinds of relationships and particular ways
of conceptualizing those relationships. It is probably no
accident that the great Chinese book on time, the <i>I Ching</i>,
with its emphasis on seasons and changes and on ways of adapting
to these and on the right time for initiating and carrying
through action should have arisen as a vegetable oracle, the
product of a farming people. </p>
<p>Conceptualizations, once arrived at, interact to produce new
conceptualizations, new technology, from which, once more, new
concepts and new needs may emerge. Television, for instance,
derives as a concept from motion pictures and radio and, even
though it was introduced only a comparatively short time ago, has
rapidly become a central part of homes at all levels of society
in our culture. Watching television has tended to produce a more
uniform culture through greater exposure to common stimuli, has
reduced the amount of time available for free interaction by
members of any particular household, and has resulted in the
creation of such implements as &quot;TV trays&quot; and &quot;TV
dinners&quot; to accommodate the need for more time around the
television set. Automobiles have made possible the movement to
the suburbs, the virtual end of public transportation in many
parts of our country, and a resultant increased dependency on
private means of transportation. In its turn, this has produced a
more mobile population, a proliferation of roads, a tendency to
think of distance in terms of units of time, the destruction of
the countryside, and an increased need to deal with air
pollution. </p>
<p>Any technological innovation in any area expands to fill all
the analogous gaps to which it can be applied. The technology of
clubs developed into the technology of axes and hoes, and, in
modern America, into the technology of baseball. Any
technological system has a degree of play that makes possible the
development of new technologies, which may not be immediately
useful, but can become functional or can be combined to be
functional when the need arises. The technique for producing
light shows has long been available but remained essentially
unused until the advent of psychedelic drugs produced its impact
on a generation accustomed to TV diffraction patterns. </p>
<p>The technology of drugs is one of the oldest technologies and
probably began when our ancestors browsed their way through the
forests and found that, among the foods they sampled, some
produced interesting changes in how they felt, how they
perceived, and how they could accommodate themselves to the
world. Substances that alter consciousness are found in use among
probably all the peoples of the world (Taylor, 1963). In
particular, substances containing alcohol and caffeine seem to be
used nearly everywhere, and hemp and its derivatives also seem
widely used. </p>
<p>Substances whose main effect is to stop hunger are classed as
foods. Even though it is now customary to present an analysis of
the chemical composition of many of the foods we eat on the sides
of the containers in which they are packaged, their action tends
to be studied in laboratories of nutrition rather than in those
of pharmacology. The kinds of detailed study of effects on
particular structures and organ systems that have historically
characterized pharmacological study are rarely undertaken with
foods. </p>
<p>Substances that increase conviviality or stimulate the
individual are often treated as foods if they can be eaten, or as
more like drugs (without usually naming them such) if they must
be smoked. Alcohol, coffee, tea, and chocolate represent the
edible class of these substances, as does cannabis and its
derivatives in many Moslem and Eastern countries. Cannabis and
tobacco probably represent the principal common substances
smoked. The continuing agitation against the use of alcohol and
cannabis by various groups in our culture suggests the anomalous
position of these kinds of substances on the food-drug continuum.
The fear and anxiety over the moral and physical degradation that
might result from enslavement to coffee, tea, and chocolate when
these were introduced into Europe are another case in point. It
should also be noted that many tobacco smokers often have trouble
conceptualizing tobacco as a drug, for the term &quot;drug&quot;
has developed very specialized meanings. </p>
<p>Among the foods sampled by our ancestors, some sustained life,
others destroyed it. Still others seemed to remove illness.
Sometimes those foods that destroyed life could also sustain it
and remove illness if administered in proper ways and in proper
amounts. It is hard to say when the division of edibles into
foods and poisons and into foods and drugs arose, for the
divisions already existed at the beginning of recorded history.
Legends of the witch woman and the wizard and their herbs, or of
the apple whose scent drives away disease are very old. A
technology of drug use is found in all cultures along with a
technology of poisons, and the control of that technology is
vested in individuals with priestly or semi-priestly functions,
or in others with claims to special relationships with the
supernatural. As the amount of knowledge around the use of the
healing arts grew, the priesthood, which dealt in healing,
gradually gave way to a more secularized group, with specialized
training, called physicians. Another group claimed jurisdiction
over the preparation of these substances and were called
apothecaries or, more recently, pharmacists. These experts knew
which drugs to prescribe and when. It was also apparent that
these substances could sometimes be dangerous when improperly
compounded or improperly used, so it was important to listen when
they told you how to use the possibly dangerous substances in
which they dealt. In addition, since they dealt in alleviating
suffering, a &quot;good guy&quot; image was easy to come by. As a
result, a drug in this context became something that was used on
the advice of a physician, and that it was foolhardy to use
otherwise. </p>
<p>While a tradition of using minor remedies for things like
colds or warts existed, reasonable people left the control of
drugs in the hands of the experts. Even patent medicines derived
their fundamental cultural status from the implied approval of
these groups, or had to go back to their precursors, the medicine
men and shamans of primitive days. To this day, television
advertisements for patent medicines that will cure headaches,
sinus congestion, or &quot;tired blood&quot; are delivered by
friendly, fatherly looking men in white coats. On the other hand,
the development of modem research technology made possible an
expansion of the number of substances recognized as specifics
against particular ailments and increased the range of illnesses
and conditions for which drugs could be used. In particular, the
realization that food-deficiency diseases exist, and the
development of vitamin pills to be used as a food supplement,
created a dynamic tension between the restricted use of drugs and
the use of pills as food. Subsequently, the modern development of
mood-changing drugs such as tranquilizers, and their promiscuous
prescription by physicians to such a point that some minor
tranquilizers can now be purchased without a prescription,
completed the breach. We became a pill-using culture, although
the earlier caution about the use of drugs remained as a nagging
sense of guilt. </p>
<p>Alongside the medically controlled and related concept of
drugs, a second conception exists of drugs as substances that
produce depressing but exotic sleep states to which the user
becomes easily addicted, to the exclusion of the claims and
pleasures of ordinary life. In Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>, Ulysses
and his crew visit the Land of the Lotus Eaters, whose
inhabitants are addicted to a fruit that, when tasted, puts the
user into a sleep in whose dreams all thoughts of home and
country are forgotten. In our country, in our time, when somebody
says he feels &quot;drugged,&quot; he is generally referring to a
state of depressed apathy. In contrast to this, we may often
refer to a situation in which we have been gratified as one in
which we have been &quot;fed.&quot; A product that does not sell
is referred to in business as &quot;a drug on the market,&quot;
but a new concept or a new perception may be &quot;food for
thought.&quot; It is a commonplace to hear how opium, the
prototype for this conception, destroyed the initiative and
capacity for constructive activity of the people in many Eastern
countries and kept them from the progress and well-being of the
Protestant ethic. It is a fact, moreover, that China did fight a
losing war to keep British enterprise from bringing in opium,
because the rulers of China felt that the effects of opium
addiction would enervate their population. </p>
<p>For us, drugs are often seen as substances used in strange and
alien cultures whose customs are the material from which
travelogues are made and to which the intrepid traveler may
venture only at the risk of being debauched. The early writings
on opium by Thomas De Quincy, and the accounts of hashish
experiences by Theophile Gautier and Fitzhugh Ludlow stress the
exotic nature of the experience. Even Coleridge's famous poem <i>Kubla
Khan</i>, written from an opium dream, in which the legendary
ruler builds a pleasure dome in Xanadu over a hidden sacred river
where women mourn for demon lovers and Abyssinian maids play
dulcimers, bears out this aura of the strange. Drugs are
substances that not only render us unable or unwilling to
function in ordinary life, but make available exotic and
forbidden landscapes. In these landscapes, the images of
nightmare from which we have fled since childhood, move and take
shape. </p>
<p>This view of the dangerous nature of drugs is further
buttressed by the modern concept of &quot;the drug
addict&quot;---an individual so enslaved by his need to escape
&quot;reality,&quot; a euphemism for the disappointments
attendant on the need to survive, that he seeks these dangerous
substances to the exclusion of the more conventional activities
that keep society functioning. This immediately arouses the fear
that if one person finds &quot;illegitimate&quot; states so
attractive, others will follow because of their inherent superior
pleasure-giving quality. The strictures by Louria (1966) on the
hedonism of drug use emphasize this fear. Similar attitudes are
expressed in the fear and condemnation of homosexuals by many
perfectly adequate and well-adjusted heterosexuals, and in the
horror felt by some parents when they find their children
masturbating. </p>
<p>The drug addict is seen as becoming less controlled and more
apt to express impulses that our society frowns upon, as his drug
use continues. He is finally so taken over by his need, and so
debauched, and so unable to make his own way, that he is forced
to turn to crime to prolong a life that is now a threat to the
survival of others. These negative images play an important role
with respect to any substance labeled &quot;drug&quot; and not
medically prescribed or available in a pharmacy. It is
interesting to note that cough medicines containing codeine, an
addicting drug, are available without prescription in many of our
states, and that, at least until recently, paregoric, which
contains a small quantity of opium, was freely available without
prescription for use with infants. That these concepts represent
an important aspect of the affective reaction to drug use is
shown by the fact that campaigns against drug abuse in general,
and the use of psychedelics in particular, have centered around
appeals to these images. </p>
<p>Psychedelics are the newest addition to drug technology in our
culture. While the use of many of these substances in their plant
form is very old, their use in our culture is very recent, apart
from minor experimentation by early scientists concerned with
consciousness, such as William James, Weir Mitchell, and Havelock
Ellis (DeRopp, 1957). Written descriptions of the use of hemp
date from about 1250 B.C. Datura preparations are used in magic
and witchcraft in many areas of the world. <i>Amanita muscaria</i>,
the fly agaric mushroom, was not only probably used by the
ancient Vikings when they went into battle, but, according to
recent evidence, may have been the legendary soma of the founders
of Hinduism (Schultes, 1969; Wasson, 1969). It is not possible to
say how far back the use of peyote, ololiuqui, or of <i>Psilocybe
mexicana</i> goes, for the records were destroyed by the Roman
Catholic missionaries to the conquered people of Mexico in their
zeal for the welfare of the souls of their charges. </p>
<p>The central property of any of the substances labeled
psychedelic is the enhancement of experience. In the anti-drug
writings in the popular and semi-popular press, psychedelics have
even been condemned as offering &quot;instant experience.&quot;
They seem to step up the capacity of the organism to respond to
fine gradations of stimulus input, to enhance response to
stimulation at the upper and lower levels of perceptual
responding, and to break down the barriers imposed by the
different sensory avenues through which stimulation is received,
in order to produce new perceptions, a greater frequency of
illusions, and, more rarely, hallucinations. Before Osmond
(1957b) coined the word &quot;psychedelic,&quot; they were more
commonly referred to as psychotomimetics or hallucinogens to
stress their capacity to mimic psychoses or induce
hallucinations. In contrast, depressants, such as alcohol and the
barbiturates, and narcotics, such as opium and morphine, reduce
attention to stimulus input, although hypnagogic and dreamlike
states are possible with all of these. Stimulants, such as the
amphetamines and caffeine, may enhance endurance, improve mood,
and increase alertness and work capacity, but they do not promote
attention to the fine nuances of sensory experience as do the
psychedelics. </p>
<p>The ability of the psychedelics to produce enhanced capacity
for experiencing, and for interrelating the data of experience,
is central in understanding both their significance and their
popularity. Very few books that deal with psychedelics fail to
include individual protocols of such experiences. Metzner (1968),
Ebin (1961), and Watts (1962) have published entire books
containing nothing but protocols of psychedelic experience.
Huxley's great book <i>The Doors of Perception</i> (1954), which
probably marks the beginning of the modern psychedelic movement,
is also such a protocol from his famous initial encounter with
the Belle of Portugal rose to his final return to &quot;that
reassuring but profoundly unsatisfactory state known as 'being in
one's right mind.'&quot; Timothy Leary's recent autobiographical
account of psychedelia, <i>High Priest</i> (1968a), is also
presented in terms of psychedelic &quot;trips.&quot; In
discussing the use of psychedelics in therapy for various
emotional disorders, Hoffer and Osmond (1967) stress that LSD,
psilocybin, and mescaline may all be equally effective. &quot;It
is the experience, not the compound which induces it, which is
responsible.&quot; </p>
<p>The stress on enhanced experiencing as the fundamental
characteristic of these substances leads, in the literature, to a
stress on the importance of the setting in which the drug is
taken. In order for the enhanced capacity for experience created
by these substances to show itself, an adequate range of stimuli
must first be available to be experienced. Administration of
psychedelics under conditions of sensory deprivation seems to
abolish most of the usual effects attributed to them (Pollard,
Uhr, and Stern, 1965). Hoffer and Osmond (1967) stress the
importance of providing adequate environmental support to produce
the kinds of experience required to produce change in
personality. Alpert and Cohen (l966) also stress the need for
adequate settings to provide psychedelic experiences. </p>
<p>On the other hand, as the stimulus situations presented to the
drug taker increase in complexity, the variability of possible
responses to those stimuli increases, especially when there is
perceptual heightening. For this reason, along with the emphasis
on setting, a companion emphasis on set---the attitudes,
motivations, preconceptions, and intentions that individuals
bring to their experiences---has arisen. Mogar (1965a, 1965c) has
suggested that contradictory results in different experiments on
the effects of psychedelics on different functions can be
accounted for by considering the differences in set and setting.
Leary, Litwin, and Metzner (1963) have suggested that the total
effect of an exposure to psilocybin could be accounted for
entirely in terms of set and setting. Krippner (1965) has pointed
out that the psychotomimetic reactions of the early studies with
LSD occurred within the context of a laboratory in which the
individual taking the drug was surrounded by white-coated
physicians who were looking for evidence that an analogous
situation to schizophrenia was being produced. Hyde (1960) showed
that when psychedelics were administered to a variety of normal
subject groups under conditions in which they were confronted
with impersonal, hostile, and investigative attitudes on the part
of others, the subjects responded with devaluative distortions
and hostility. Flexibility, familiarity, and the presence of
others with a common culture ameliorated the psychotomimetic
aspects of the reaction, while rigidity, unfamiliarity,
non-acceptance, and absence of others with a common culture
exacerbated them. </p>
<p>While few would seek enhanced experience if that experience
were negative, the ability to enhance the capacity for experience
is an important reason for the increased popularity of
psychedelics. People tend to do what they are good at.
Well-co-ordinated, well-muscled individuals are apt to be
involved in athletics; those with good number ability are apt to
enjoy working with numbers. One of the best predictive devices
for vocational success is the Strong Vocational Interest
Inventory, which provides scores based on the similarity of an
individual's interest patterns to those of individuals who are
successful in their chosen fields. Virtually everyone has the
capacity to react, judge, and seek out experience. People will
often go on long and arduous journeys just to see things, or will
buy recording equipment, radios, or television just to provide
themselves with stimulation. They will register for difficult
courses of instruction with no demonstrable practical
consequences for themselves, in order to enhance their
experience. This is not unique to man, for animals show a similar
pattern of experience seeking (Welker, 1961). In human societies,
the theater, the church, sports spectaculars, the pomp and
ceremony of parades, the rides, color, and glitter of carnivals,
all are institutions created to meet the need for enhanced
experience. We are built to process stimuli, and an important
part of living is seeking out stimuli to be processed. The
popularity of psychedelics is not only a function of this general
characteristic of stimulus seeking, but it also suggests the
relative infrequency of bad experiences resulting from their use,
unless we wish to posit masochism as an equally fundamental
characteristic of biological adjustment. </p>
<p>Because psychedelics focus attention on individual experience,
some important social consequences arise from their use.
Individual experience is on the one hand unique to the
experienced and on the other characterized by great transpersonal
commonality as one goes deeper into the self (Aaronson, 1968d).
In spite of the scientific validity of the behaviorist critique
that private experience is not available for scientific
observation, for each of us, as individuals, our own experiences
have a veridicality shared by few other things in this world. We
not only seek experience, we respond in terms of our experiences,
and accord a special hearing to those who can &quot;speak from
experience.&quot; Immediate experience is of greater consequence
to the individual experiencing it than any promise of future good
or ill made by a personal or impersonal authority figure. Any
parent who has had to take a child to face a shot administered to
him by his kindly pediatrician can testify to this. Any smoker
who lights up contentedly as he reads the warning on his
cigarette pack also shows its validity. </p>
<p>When individual experience is emphasized, the generalized
verbal formulas for societal control based on hoary and
long-unquestioned precepts become open to question as they are
filtered through the individual consciousness. Various
institutions maintain their authority by means of symbols and
concepts that evoke traditional emotional reactions, and the
more-rational verbal responses function as unconscious
rationalizations of these reactions. That is, many logical
arguments turn out to be simply elaborations of illogical
emotional biases. These traditional emotional biases are
inculcated from the earliest age at home, in the schools, and in
the propaganda organizations for children, such as the Boy
Scouts, the Girl Scouts, the YMCA, and other groups. Similar
institutions exist in Communist and Fascist societies, except
that there the conditioning tends to be more frenetic and
compulsive than in our own. The attention to the ways in which
these symbols can affect us makes plain the inherent illogic of
conventional wisdom. Once the question of &quot;Why, indeed,
should I respond in this way?&quot; has been posed, many of the
structures of society will tumble if answers cannot be found
rooted in the existential being of the questioner. </p>
<p>Many of the consequences of this kind of questioning can be
seen not only among the hippies and in Leary's concept of society
as a collection of television stage props (1968b), but in the
kinds of questions posed by those of our young people who have
not obviously taken on the extreme styles of life represented
either by the hippies or by Leary. The use of marijuana is
sufficiently widespread among our young adult groups that
attitudes developing from attention to one's own consciousness
have pervaded their style of approach to the world. Before the
question of &quot;What career shall I choose?&quot; can be
answered, the question of &quot;Why should I choose a
career?&quot; must be settled. Before one can agree to fight for
flag and country, the existential meaning of flag, country,
death, killing, freedom, and a host of other concepts must be
considered. The source of power is not seen as being conferred
from on high, but as arising from the behavior toward the power
wielder of those over whom power is exercised. This attitude has
tremendous implications with regard to the kinds of behavior that
will be displayed toward the traditional holders of power and the
traditional methods of displaying power. </p>
<p>The development of similar emphases on personal revelation and
personal consciousness at various points in the history of
Christendom led to the formation of many of our existing
Protestant denominations and the replacement of the old Catholic
concept of an ordained priesthood with a new concept of the
priesthood of all believers. The so-called &quot;generation
gap&quot; is a mirage that results not from the traditional need
of the young to make their way in a world of already established
people nor from any traditional traits of impatience or idealism,
although all these may be factors, but from differing amounts of
attention to the importance of individual experience. Because of
the greater willingness of young people to try new things, the
consciousness-changing chemicals had their greatest effect along
peer-group lines. </p>
<p>Because of the fact that each individual consciousness is
located in a body, increased awareness of the body and of our
functions as biological organisms seems to occur in the
psychedelic-user population. This is not the kind of stress on
the body traditionally associated with weight lifting or the
overdevelopment of body parts that give a good male or female
image, but desire for a well-functioning body that is pleasant to
experience. This has led to an interest in hatha yoga and in tai
chi, the Indian and Chinese systems of exercise whose aim is not
muscular development, but peace, coordination, and good bodily
functioning. All bodily functions and bodily needs are more apt
to be accepted and, even more important, respected. The ancient
verbal taboos limiting sexual behavior have been weakened by the
non-verbal nature of psychedelic experience. Excretory functions
are accepted without embarrassment. Preferences develop for
simple foods with more concern about how these may affect the
body, although there is some tendency for this concern to turn to
cultishness. Clothes are no longer used to hide the body, but to
emphasize the body as the source of experience. The greater
openness with regard to the physical self has been accompanied by
relaxation of the taboo against touching other people and being
touched by them, an event of overriding social consequence in
changing the character, intensity, scope, and available
possibilities in any interpersonal relationship. </p>
<p>Beyond the perception of the body itself, the enhanced sensory
experience has called attention to the pleasures and insights
that can be obtained directly from sensory experience. Light
shows and modern rock music reflect some of the visual and
auditory experiences produced by psychedelics. Aldous Huxley
(1956) has pointed out the luminous intensity of colors found in
&quot;the antipodes of the mind,&quot; and this is mimicked by
Day-Glo paints and the eerie glow of colors under black light.
The greater sensitivity to color reflections, color shadows, and
afterimages, especially as they appear reflected on glossy
surfaces like skin, has led to the modern fashion of body
painting. Along with the perception of oneself as a biological
organism, with its consequent emphasis on the simple and natural,
there has been an increased awareness of the complexity and
beauty of natural phenomena. This has been further elaborated by
the fact that, with many of the psychedelics, the retinal
structure of the eye itself enters into the perception, as Kluver
(1966) has pointed out. This has complicated the drive for
simplicity with a preference for the baroque. The resulting
dynamic tension appears in all forms of psychedelic decoration,
music, literature, and art. Masters and Houston (1968) have shown
this well in their recently published book on psychedelic art,
which runs the gamut from simple meditative expressions to
welters of clashing stimulation designed to make the viewer leave
his senses through overstimulation of his senses. </p>
<p>Going deeply into one's own experience leads to insights
beyond those experienced when the focus of attention is on what
is experienced rather than the mode of experience itself. The
appearance of reality is no longer taken at face value, but is
seen as an interaction with the perceptual apparatus of the
perceiver. This means that the usual existential primacy given
the world around us, probably because we are built to process
information coming to us from the outside, gives way to an
equality of perceives and perceived, so that the perception
itself becomes the primary datum in a conscious sense, as it has
always been without our realization. This is, indeed, one of the
goals of many meditative systems, and meditation as such has
become a popular activity among the psychedelic subgroup and
those influenced by them. Indeed, movement within the self away
from its more-surface manifestations inevitably invokes religious
imagery (Masters and Houston, 1966; Aaronson, 1968a), although
images invoking religious feelings may be possible at all levels
of consciousness. The sense that depth is expanded, common in
psychedelic experiences, is like the environmental conditions
most commonly associated with mystical experience, and mystical
experiences can be produced by experimentally providing
experiences of enhanced depth (Aaronson, 1967d). </p>
<p>Movement within reaches the level of archetype and myth and
may transcend these to a point of ultimate mystical union. The
archetypes may be an elaboration of current material featured in
the concerns of the popular press, as Barron (1967) has pointed
out. They may derive from early impressions and concerns fed by
other technologies in our culture. Tom Wolfe (1968), for
instance, has pointed out the prevalence of imagery from the
comic books dear to children in the late thirties and early
forties in the group centering around Ken Kesey. They may derive
from fundamental perceptions of our own structures and modes of
functioning. Barron (1967) has noted, &quot;an experience of
Christ, i.e. of Christ free from the institutional embodiment
known as Christianity, is common to many psychedelic
&quot;trips.&quot; Christ on the cross may then be understood
simply as &quot;consciousness impaled on the human form, mind
hung to die on body to expiate our voluntary participation in the
world's heavy materialism.&quot; This manner of thinking and
perceiving, the concentration on archetype, the sense of an
indwelling, immanent God, and the interest in meditation have
correspondingly created an interest in those forms of religion
that stress these notions: Hinduism, and Tibetan and Zen
Buddhism. Psychedelic experience is fundamentally religious, as
any experience of life taken as an experience of life must be.
Braden (1967) has pointed out that the fundamental thrust of
psychedelic experience is religious and its fundamental challenge
is to the forms of organized religion. It is one of the forces
contributing to the ferment in contemporary Christianity that is
presently leading one of the oldest and most tradition-bound of
Christian churches to reevaluate its forms, its structure, and
many of the engrafted beliefs of its development. </p>
<p>The development of any new major innovation in technology
affects profoundly the life and structure of the society in which
it occurs. The development of psychedelics is such a major
innovation, which promises revolutionary changes and is, in fact,
already producing them. Psychedelics may have a potential impact
on society equivalent to that of the machine, which in setting
off the Industrial Revolution, created much of what we now
consider our &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;traditional&quot;
styles of life and forms of organizing society. At the time of
the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, those dispossessed by
the new forms blamed the machines and tried to wreck them in the
Luddite rebellion. Our modern Luddites are not the dispossessed,
but those who exist at the very center of the power structure.
The alteration of values, the questioning of rules by those who
have had psychedelic experiences, create much consternation,
often by their very own children, among individuals who have made
their way by those rules and under the value system of the
existing society. In addition, the negative implications of the
concept &quot;drug,&quot; noted earlier in this discussion, are
not without their effects. </p>
<p>Confronted by danger, each carries out his social function.
The mass media simultaneously point at the wonders of psychedelic
experience and view them with alarm. Psychologists,
psychiatrists, and sociologists, whose business it is to find
abnormality in deviance, find abnormality in deviance. Government
agencies introduce regulations, lawmakers make laws, and
policemen police. The upshot of all this activity is that it is
now almost impossible to carry out legitimate research with
psychedelics. A large user population has developed that uses
bootleg drugs, sometimes containing dangerous impurities, and
almost certainly producing revenue for organized crime. Drugs are
now used by individuals who, under a system of controlled access
to them, would probably not have been exposed to them and run the
risk of injuring themselves. It is difficult to set up safeguards
for the proper use of the major psychedelics when this use is
illegal. One segment of our population exists under conditions
reminiscent of prohibition, while the other looks on with alarm.
A crisis in confidence has been created that cuts across
generational lines. A great many people who normally would be
law- abiding are placed in the position of outlaws, with marked
implications for their further relationships to society and its
institutions. </p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this paper to do any more than
outline briefly some of the implications of psychedelic
technology and some of its associated problems. The rest of this
book is devoted to filling in the picture in more detail. At the
present time, the repressive attitudes toward this new technology
are so strong that its effects can only show themselves in
strange and aborted forms. Perhaps the situation will be eased to
permit more-open and controlled development of what is now
clandestine and uncontrolled. Hopefully. </p>

<title>Request for a Public Hearing</title>
</head>

<body>

<hr>

<p>The first realistic step toward making the legislation
concerning control and use of psychedelic chemicals based
primarily on light rather than heat is public education. Toward
this end I submitted to the Government this spring a request for
a PUBLIC hearing. The text of this request follows:</p>

<hr>

<p> <center></p>

<h4>HEARING CLERK<br>
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION AND WELFARE<br>
ROOM 5440<br>
330 INDEPENDENCE AVENUE S.W. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20201 </h4>
</center>

<p> LSD and the other psychedelic (mind-manifesting) chemicals
represent a new fact for our society. These chemicals, the most
powerful mind-altering substances known to man, are presently
being researched for their therapeutic potential with alcoholics,
drug addicts, autistic children, psychoneurotics, and prisoners,
as well as for their potential to increase man's creativity in
problem-solving and their value to the military. Significant
research has also demonstrated that these chemicals are capable
of altering the perception of terminal cancer patients in such a
way as to alleviate their fear of dying. The Native American
Church continues to use peyote as a medicine in its religious
ceremonies. </p>

<p> In addition to these &quot;authorized&quot; uses of
psychedelic chemicals, there is, as a result of increased
restriction on who is considered a &quot;qualified
researcher&quot; with psychedelics, a significant increase in
&quot;private research,&quot; i.e., research not authorized by
the U.S. Government. The data from a variety of public and
private sources indicate that this extralegal activity is not
limited to any specific segment of society. Among these private
explorers are numbered religious leaders of all faiths,
scientists in both the natural and social sciences, medical men
specializing in general practice as well as psychiatry; writers,
artists, performers, musicians, educators, students, journalists,
psychic researchers, businessmen, housewives, mystics,
philosophers, lawyers, socialites, engineers, and
&quot;beatniks.&quot; </p>

<p> When these chemicals have been ingested with suitable
preparation and in a supportive setting, by far the majority of
these psychedelic researchers have reported that their
experiences with the chemicals have enriched their life
experience, helped them to feel a greater sense of satisfaction.
For some of these people the experience has provided this
increased satisfaction spiritually, for others through helping
their marriages to achieve new depth and meaning, for others in
their professions, and for the majority through their ability to
experience each day more fully with a sense of increased
awareness. </p>

<p> There is at the present time no statistical evidence that
psychedelic chemicals are either dangerous or physically
addictive. In terms of suicides and psychosis, psychedelics used
in currently recommended dosages are considerably safer than, for
example, a four-year liberal arts education As far as
psychological risk (post-experience depressions, etc.) is
concerned, most of this can be prevented by education and
preparation of the researcher as well as design of the setting. </p>

<p> At present in our society there is no existing social
institution which provides a citizen with the opportunity to
utilize psychedelic chemicals to explore his own brain or
consciousness in order to increase his awareness should he so
desire, be it for spiritual, educational, therapeutic, or
esthetic reasons. The potential for mankind in these chemicals
cannot be realized under existing governmental policies. Thus the
presence of the psychedelic chemicals as well as the growing
public interest in serious exploration with them poses a real
need for CREATIVE LEGISLATION. It is to be hoped that our vision
and our commitment to growth of the individual and the society
will prevent us from legislating out of existence one of man's
greatest chances to expand the boundaries of his mind, his
individuality, and his culture. </p>

<p> Lyndon Johnson speaks of &quot;The Great Society.&quot; It is
interesting to speculate whether such a society as he envisions
has a place for a genuinely new institution which could
significantly alter the institutions of the society itself. </p>

<p> Since 1963 many of us who are deeply concerned about the
welfare of mankind have attempted to interest the Government in a
genuinely open-minded search for a constructive program regarding
who should use and who should control psychedelics. We have
suggested that Government-controlled privately supported centers
be created under limited licensing (a policy presently used with
radioisotopes) which would provide a suitable setting and
assistance for any responsible member of our society to carry on
explorations of his own consciousness with psychedelics for
whatever purpose he chose. Not only has the Government failed to
seriously consider this proposal, but every indication is that
the restrictions are mounting, and the Government is attempting
to ignore the uniqueness of the situation by treating psychedelic
chemicals as similar to other drugs. </p>

<p> It will become increasingly difficult with the implementation
of new and more stringent restrictions for free and open research
to proceed with these chemicals in the United States. According
to the new Drug Abuse Control Amendment, an individual can
possess psychedelics for the use of himself or a member of his
household but cannot legally purchase or receive the chemical.
The results of such control without simultaneously making
provisions for the opportunity for responsible citizens to
research their own consciousness legally will be predominantly
unfortunate, leading to, for example: (1) an increase in the
manufacture of homemade psychedelic chemicals having little or no
quality control; (2) an increase in the paranoia connected with
psychedelic chemical usage which in turn will increase the danger
of negative psychological reactions to the experience; (3) an
increase in the number of responsible and useful citizens who,
because of their deep conviction about the value of psychedelic
research, will continue such research and thus become criminals
in the eyes of law; (4) an attempt by the Government to enforce
an obviously unenforceable law because of the numbers of citizens
involved, thus re-creating the effects of prohibition, during
which time the Government enforcement agencies lost respect in
the eyes of the populace; and (5) a possibility of losing what
might be a key for man to free himself of the limitation of his
own present vision which has caught him so deeply in alienation
and paranoia, be it at the personal or national level. </p>

<p> It is in view of the situation as outlined above that we
hereby request that the Commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration hold public hearings concerning the inclusion of
psychedelic chemicals as listed in the Federal Register, January
18, 1966, under the Drug Abuse Control Amendment. We further
request that these hearings be addressed to the following
questions: </p>

<p> 1. Does the inclusion of psychedelic chemicals under the Drug
Abuse Control Amendment unnecessarily curtail an individual's
rights provided by the First Amendment of the Constitution?
Specifically we wish to explore the implications of this Act for
religious freedom. </p>

<p> 2. Is there indeed sufficient evidence to warrant Government
control of psychedelics on the basis of real danger to the public
safety? </p>

<p> 3. What is a &quot;qualified research investigator&quot; in
the field of psychedelic chemicals? </p>

<p> 4. Are medical practitioners, in view of the nature of their
training, suitable supervisors for the administration of
psychedelic chemicals? </p>

<p> 5. Were the Commissioner to bring a chemical under the
control of his department based on a categorization of the
chemical as producing &quot;ecstasy&quot; or &quot;impairment of
acquired social and cultural customs,&quot; (Federal Register,
December 18, 1965), would he not be setting a dangerous precedent
concerning ideas and experiences which could significantly
contribute to the growth of the society? </p>

<p> 6. Has the Commissioner heard sufficient testimony concerning
the sociological, psychological, educational, philosophical, and
spiritual implications of controlling psychedelics to determine
his decision to include these chemicals within the Act, on a
sufficiently broad cultural basis? </p>

<p> 7. Does one have the right to decide for himself whether he
wants to explore his own consciousness or change the nature of
his own consciousness? </p>

<p> 8. If, with the knowledge that the ingestion of psychedelic
chemicals by some people leads to negative reactions, an
individual chooses to ingest a psychedelic agent in order to
explore his own consciousness, does the Federal Government have
the right to interfere with such a person who is willing to
assume the risk? Is the Government by so doing assuming the right
to protect an individual from himself? </p>

<p> 9. Does the Food and Drug Administration have the right to
initiate punitive action in connection with psychedelic chemicals
where the individual has not harmed himself or society? Does the
Food and Drug Administration have the right to impose punishment
for effects of altered consciousness, or is the criminal law and
punishment only reserved for actual wrongdoing and harm to
society? </p>

<p> 10. Does the end justify the means? Can enforcement of the
Food and Drug Administration law under consideration occur
without gross invasion of the right of privacy? How will a
violation come to the attention of the Food and Drug
Administration? Will the willing possessor of psychedelic
chemicals report a violation of this law? </p>

<p> 11. Is it desirable for a law to be enacted that creates an
estimated 100,000 to one million criminals? </p>

<p> 12. Will the Food and Drug Administration be brought to the
same level of respect as the Prohibition Unit of the Federal
Government during the Prohibition era? Will the promises offered
by the Prohibition Unit that &quot;if we can have stiffer
penalties and more Prohibition Agents, alcohol will be stamped
out&quot; be offered by the Food and Drug Administration when it
finds itself unable to &quot;stamp out&quot; the prohibited
substance? If the Prohibition Unit failed in enforcement of the
Volstead Act and the Eighteenth Amendment despite every effort,
will not this similarly unenforceable and corruption-breeding
Food and Drug Administration law meet with a similar fate? </p>

<p> 13. Finally, we request that the hearing be addressed to the
matter of inclusion of another &quot;drug&quot; as fulfilling the
criteria for inclusion as &quot;hallucinogen&quot; (Federal
Register, December 18, 1965) under the Drug Abuse Control
Amendment. This drug is commonly referred to as
&quot;alcohol.&quot; We wish the Food and Drug Administration to
justify how it can impose controls upon psychedelic chemicals
because of &quot;dangers&quot; and &quot;abuse&quot; in view of
the comparative statistics concerning the &quot;dangers&quot; and
&quot;abuse&quot; attendant to the use of alcohol. </p>

<P>
Those older men and women exercising structural and moral authority
(Paterson, 1966), often called collectively the Establishment,
have been alarmed by psychedelics for rather less than five years.
Their attitude might be described in the terms Aneurin Bevan used
for an old man approaching a young bride: &quot;. . . fascinated,
sluggish, and apprehensive.&quot; The impetuous young, however,
always at the heart of any anti-establishment movement, rush in
with all the rash ardor of Romeo and Juliet. Medical men, though
less worried about morals or legality, are properly concerned
with the health of the young lovers, and have been debating, not
without acrimony, whether the entrancing psychedelic bride is
a delicious and sexy houri or a poxy doxy.
<P>
This fascination of older folk with psychedelics and the climate
attached to them becomes evident in the propaganda devoted to
them by many government agencies, professional associations, and
other interested people. While this has been aimed ostensibly
at discouraging the young from taking or continuing to take these
substances, the means employed seem unlikely to achieve such an
end. The cause of pornography has frequently been well served
by those whose strident warnings abjured others from seeking what,
until then, they had hardly noticed. Public men have, quite unwittingly,
by their ignorance, evasion, and downright lies, egged on their
children and grandchildren to explore these experiences. It appears
sometimes as if they were trying to discredit themselves in the
eyes of the young. It may not be their intention, but it seems
to be their achievement.
<P>
Our connection with this intergenerational controversy began about
sixteen years ago, when one of us, after a troubled night, was
standing at a table stirring a glass of water in which silvery
white crystals were dissolving with an oily slick. Would it be
enough or too much? He was uneasy: he would be disappointed if
nothing happened, but what if the mescaline worked too well? Suppose
he poured half of the full glass into an adjacent flower vase?
He did not relish the possibility, however remote, of finding
a small, but discreditable niche in literary history as the man
who drove Aldous Huxley mad. His fears proved groundless. Although
the bitter chemical did not work as quickly as he had expected,
in due course it etched away the patina of conceptual thinking.
<P>
Much has happened since that smogless May morning in Hollywood.
Neither Aldous Huxley nor he would have predicted that <I>The
Doors of Perception</I> (1954) was going to have such an immense
impact on an ever-increasing number of people. Those substances,
then known as hallucinogens or psychotomimetics, and which he
later called psychedelics (Osmond, 1957b), have, for good or evil,
become far more widely known and no longer the concern merely
of the specialist and scholar. They are part of our vocabulary,
a source of both vexation and inspiration.
<P>
Less than ten years after the senior author's spring visit to
Hollywood, Pandora's box was unexpectedly opened. Since then,
members of the Establishment have been sitting on the lid of the
empty box, unaware that this posture is both undignified and futile.
It is the fate of establishments to be taken by surprise in spite
of ample and repeated warnings. Once they have become aware that
something is amiss, they often act precipitately, with little
forethought or caution, and transform a minor inconvenience or
even possible benefits into catastrophe. There was plenty of warning
that psychedelics were apt to be of interest to people and also
to become more available so that this long-standing human taste
could be indulged more easily. It required no gift of prophecy
to recognize this, for history shows that man has been an inveterate
experimenter with chemicals, usually derived from plants, that
make him happier or livelier, or alter his perceptions and awareness.
In his sumptuous and magnificent book <I>Soma: Divine Mushroom
of Immortality</I> (1969), for example, R. Gordon Wasson, the
mycologist-scholar, has shown convincingly that the <I>Rig Veda</I>,
one of the oldest and greatest of man's religious works, devoted
about one tenth of its collection of over one thousand psalms
to celebrating the plant god Soma. Wasson, with wonderful persistence,
caution, and intuition, makes a good case for soma being the mushroom
<I>Amanita muscaria</I>, or fly agaric, the classic toadstool
of the birch forests of the world. Psychedelics are a very ancient
and influential human interest.
<P>
What has the Establishment been doing about them? If one had listened
only to its members from a recent president on down, one might
have been convinced that psychedelics had no future at all because
of the development of ever-growing and increasingly specialized
law- enforcement agencies to remove the nuisance permanently.
In the past year or two, the tone has changed somewhat, along
with other overoptimistic estimates. On the other hand, if one
listened only to supporters of the psychedelic movement, one might
be led to suppose that an age was borning in which from earliest
childhood, and possibly the prenatal state, we would all be exposed
to the delights and virtues of wholly beneficial substances. The
facts do not support either of these extreme positions, but extreme
positions rarely depend on facts. Long before the official Establishment
had asked itself what sort of problem it might be facing, legislation
was being prepared, bills hurriedly passed, statements of an alarming
kind made, and vigorous legal and police action taken. This was
not admirable, but it was no more admirable of the psychedelic
movement to imply that there were scarcely any dangers attendant
on these remarkable substances and that we should all hasten along
the road to the &quot;joyous cosmology,&quot; taking anything
anyone offered, and trusting it would be enough, and not too much.
<P>
The Establishment's posture is not difficult to understand, for
it is that of all establishments everywhere when faced with innovation.
It consists in saying, &quot;No, you don't. Father (or Grandfather)
knows best. Be good and do as you are told, for if you don't,
it will be the worse for you.&quot; Before planning and passing
legislation or developing new policing procedures, it might seem
prudent to assess the effectiveness of such actions, and consider
whether police activities might not have unintended consequences
as bad as or worse than the evils to be remedied. This is especially
true in the United States, where prohibition, with all its admirable
intentions, merely provided a golden opportunity for gangsters
to become multimillionaires and spread the habit the legislation
was intended to curb. The most likely outcome of prohibition in
the early twenties was that, since many people did not feel that
drinking alcohol was immoral, even though it might have become
illegal, the law would be widely subverted. Criminals would then
have an opportunity to provide these disaffected citizens with
their needs. The police would be liable to be corrupted, the law
itself brought into disrepute, and because most people would come
to feel that prohibition itself is a farce, they would tend to
consider that the law is a racket, too. This is a high price to
pay for an unattainable social benefit.
<P>
Other legislation aimed at preventing people from taking substances,
such as psychedelics, that they want to take should surely be
examined in this context. As we have noted, this is an interest
that men have pursued for millennia with great persistence and
in a variety of ways, ranging from self-inflicted tortures and
austerities to taking dangerous substances. Drugs are only one
of many possible ways of achieving these experiences, and are
by no means the most objectionable from a medical viewpoint. From
earliest times, psychedelics have been regarded as strange and
sacred and have been part of many great religious ceremonies.
They are certainly as enduring and interesting for mankind as
alcohol, although, since the rise of modern agriculture, alcohol
has been probably easier to obtain. On the other hand, cannabis
has been used for many centuries. It may not be a simple matter
to head off people's interest in psychedelics; it has not been
easy to head off interest in alcohol. Had it been possible to
prevent people from making alcoholic drinks, prohibition would
have been feasible. As it was, everyone could make his own fermented
drink in the bathtub, and before long, the well-meant laws to
curb drinking had become meaningless and socially harmful.
<P>
In 1966, the government did not seem to have considered these
early experiences much, and appeared to believe that by preventing
Sandoz from manufacturing and distributing LSD to research workers,
the problem would soon be resolved. Indeed, one of us was told
by an aide of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy that the ex-Attorney
General of the United States was surprised to learn &quot;that
preventing Sandoz from selling LSD (which, of course, they were
not doing, but giving it away only to accredited researchers)
would not resolve the problem. &quot;Even though Senator Kennedy
was a young, active, and unusually well-informed man, he was ignorant
of this, although he quickly acquired the necessary information.
The elderly men who govern most countries apparently failed to
ask or have impressed upon them the questions facing those who
wish to control the use of psychedelics.
<P>
During World War II, British and American intelligence services
briefed their generals by first giving an opinion as to what was
most likely to happen, followed by a statement of what they considered
the best possible outcome in the circumstances, and finally, the
worst possible construction. The general officer, knowing the
conclusion of his intelligence service, could then make his own
decision, basing it on optimism, pessimism, or a middle way, as
he saw fit. Suppose it had been our task to advise statesmen on
the future of psychedelic substances, what would we have told
them, assuming that we knew that they were already more or less
limited to a policy of control? From this point of view, the best
possible thing that could happen would be for people to lose interest
in psychedelics once and for all, and for the sources of supply
to dry up forever. The worst that could happen for the Establishment
would be for supplies of psychedelics to become greater and easier
to make in a climate of sustained or increasing interest, thus
producing a situation resembling prohibition at its worst.
<P>
How would these two extreme estimates relate to the most likely
outcomes It would be surprising if an interest so long sustained
ever disappears completely. Indeed, our age is one in which interest
in these matters seems more likely to increase. Today, at least
in North America and Europe, there are larger numbers of highly
mobile young people, many of them fairly well-to-do, than ever
before in history. Most have been reared with less severity than
previous generations and have largely escaped the terrible blows
that death, illness, starvation, and poverty frequently inflict
on the young. They are sufficiently uncowed by the world to be
highly critical of how it is run, and have the energy, time, and
opportunity to express dissatisfaction and explore new ways of
improving matters. Their education has taught them how to use
libraries and other modern information-retrieval systems. Many
of them became interested in psychedelics in the early sixties,
and while this preoccupation may fluctuate, it seems unlikely
that it will disappear completely. The interest of the Indians
in drugs survived the full force of the Spanish Inquisition, and
it is unlikely that even the severest legislators intend to emulate
that mighty institution in policing their children and grandchildren.
<P>
In addition, with regard to the control of the substances themselves,
more have been discovered and rediscovered during the past decade
and a half than in any similar period in history. It seems likely
that more will be found during the next ten years. Some of these
will be discovered in plants and others synthesized. Every discovery
makes it easier to suggest not only new places in which to look
for active substances, but also new ways of making them. We predict
that within the next twenty-five years, and perhaps sooner, simple
processes will be discovered by which reasonably safe psychedelics
can be made in any kitchen or basement with materials available
in stores, pharmacies, and fields or gardens. Some believe the
best way to avoid these dangers would be to stop all research
on psychedelics. In our opinion, this would be objectionable,
since these substances have great interest for psychology and
psychiatry and since there is, as we have shown here, growing
evidence of their therapeutic usefulness. It would also not succeed
in stopping the clandestine experiments in the synthesis or use
of these substances, for forbidden fruits not only taste sweeter,
but develop an esoteric interest. Presumably this &quot;occult&quot;
science, because it would be &quot;illegal,&quot; would not be
published in official scientific journals. A sort of underground
science would develop, which at least would be deplorable, and
might be very dangerous.
<P>
In our imaginary briefings, the statesmen would be told that the
most likely outcome during the next decade would be that the interest
in these substances would be maintained, though it is likely to
fluctuate from year to year. Although a number of new psychedelics
will be discovered, there is no convincing evidence that the era
of &quot;bathtub&quot; psychedelics has yet arrived, allowing
them to be made in ease and safety at home. Should this occur,
the resulting situation will resemble that of prohibition.
<P>
Statesmen must surely ask themselves whether it is wise to invent
new crimes or inflate misdemeanors into matters of great importance.
The roster of criminal law is large; by adding new laws that are
difficult to enforce, respect for the law may be decreased. Certain
kinds of new laws may be expensive luxuries that societies in
the course of change simply cannot afford. We believe that the
interest in psychedelics will be maintained in the foreseeable
future. If police and similar agencies devote much of their energy
to controlling the substances, the overt interest may become less
conspicuous. Prosecuting people does not necessarily change their
opinions, but may invest forbidden activity with glamour and make
those undertaking it discreet. It is said that crime has been
increasing greatly in recent years, and one wonders whether this
is a propitious time to add a whole new series of crimes to the
burden of an already overladen police and magistracy.
<P>
Already there are laws of such severity on the statute books that
judges, juries, and police often shy away from using them, although,
from time to time, unlucky people receive very harsh punishment,
which seems unfair both to them and to their contemporaries. It
seems unlikely that occasional severities will do much to change
the general picture. However, in politics as elsewhere, men have
rarely shown a sense of history or adequate foresight, and the
same legislators who promise a tough line against psychedelics
talk blithely about reducing the voting age to eighteen. If these
statements are sincere, and they plan to continue their opposition
to psychedelics when they have reduced the voting age, one wonders
whether we are not becoming tired of politics.
<P>
In our opinion, the Establishment has behaved as establishments
usually do, bolstered with the authority they possess by virtue
of their social and political position. They have not been any
less admirable than members of the psychedelic movement who claim
that as a result of their experiences they have a deeper knowledge
of the human heart and a greater understanding of the meaning
of things. By their claims, their actions must be judged by a
higher standard than the actions of the Establishment, which does
not make such claims. If one asks whether mind-expanding experiences
have increased the ability of members of the psychedelic movement
to understand the views and fears of their elders more compassionately
than they feel they themselves have been judged, we believe the
verdict must be &quot;not proven.&quot; Aldous Huxley once urged
a leading figure in the psychedelic movement to remember that
it is &quot;important to do good stealthily.&quot; His excellent
advice has not always been heeded. If indeed insights have been
acquired as a result of psychedelic experience, they should be
used for the general good rather than for personal ends.
<P>
In this controversy, medical men have tended to be ranged on the
side of the Establishment. This is understandable enough, for
they are frequently closely associated with it, and often among
its members. Unfortunately, they sometimes use their enormous
medical authority to justify prejudices deriving not from medical
knowledge, but from the social and moral climate in which they
happen to live. This has occurred repeatedly throughout history,
and the same error has been made by some of the most distinguished
medical men.
<P>
An excellent example of this is provided by the case of Henry
Maudsley, one of the most enlightened psychiatrists of his day,
and for whom a leading mental hospital in London is presently
named. In his fine paper &quot;Masturbational Insanity,&quot;
E. H. Hare (1962) notes that Maudsley wrote, &quot;In the life
of the chronic masturbator, nothing could be so reasonably desired
as the end of it, and the sooner he sinks to his degraded rest
the better for himself, and the better for the world, which is
well rid of him.&quot; Hare comments on this, &quot;. . . the
besetting sin of the psychiatrist [is] a tendency to confuse the
rules of mental health with morality.&quot; Maudsley's views were
part of the conventional wisdom of his age. Even as late as 1892,
the Dictionary of Psychological Medicine described the effects
of masturbation as &quot;moral and mental shipwreck, the whole
nature is deteriorated.... mental faculties become blunted....
The miserable wretch would commit suicide if he dared, but rarely
has the courage . . . and sinks into melancholic dementia.&quot;
Writing in 1911 on the treatment and prevention of this grievous
condition, Ivan Bloch stated, &quot;In the treatment of masturbation,
the methods of the older physicians who appeared before the child
armed with great knives and scissors and threatened a painful
operation or even to cut off the genital organs may often be used
and often effect a radical cure.&quot; Psychoanalysts, too, were
involved in this nonsense. Ernest Jones, the biographer of Freud,
for instance, wrote in 1918 that neurasthenia derived from excessive
onanism and seminal emission (Comfort, 1967).
<P>
Masturbation was of no interest to medicine until about 1720,
following the publication in 1710 of a book called <I>Onania,
or the Heinous Sin of Self-Abuse</I>, to tout a patent medicine.
Indeed, in 1644, masturbation was recommended as a remedy against
&quot;the dangerous allurements of women.&quot; After the publication
of Onania, the negative view taken up by medical men and educators
became the source of some of the most harmful iatrogenic miseries,
exceeded only by the great nineteenth-century pandemic of bleeding.
Right up to the 1930S, in both England and the United States,
extraordinary garments, a combination of straitjacket and chastity
belt, were sold by makers of surgical and medical instruments
to curb &quot;the deadly vice of onanism.&quot;
<P>
What relevance has this to psychedelics? Medicine, in its views,
is in tune with the morality of the age in which it is practiced,
and indeed, has been more or less identified with morality for
millennia. Medical men have to choose a middle course to avoid
overidentifcation with the establishments of their day. Medical
men who went along with the Nazi race theories are one dismal
example of how current social values can destroy medical ethics.
In the case of masturbation, physical and psychological injury
was inflicted on at least six generations of children and adults.
Panic and terror spread among parents who were urged to be ever
alert to spot young masturbators. Children became morbidly preoccupied
with this attractive but deadly vice which excited the grownups
to such frenzy.
<P>
Perhaps we are about to indulge in yet another of these medicomoral
autos-da-f&eacute;. The sequence of events is easy to spot. First,
a few medical men associate themselves with a particular moral
viewpoint that they consider has some medical importance. They
soon find evidence, sometimes dubious, to confirm their convictions.
Using this evidence, they begin to suggest solving the moral problem
by medical means. In the psychedelic context, users have been
infringing on the contention of the medical establishment that
any pharmacological substances used on human beings lie within
its bailiwick. The psychological changes resulting from drug use
are those older folk frown upon and sometimes find repugnant and
frightening, in contrast with such acceptable social tranquilizers
as alcohol or barbiturates. There is also the possibility that
those who use psychedelics might be injuring themselves or their
offspring. The recent impassioned discussions of the possible
effects of LSD on chromosomes is paralleled by similar discussions
over masturbation. It was stated with the utmost confidence that
not only would the secret vice result in the collapse and insanity
of those who practiced it, but should they be unfortunate enough
to survive to adulthood, their children would suffer for their
sins. There was no evidence for this, but it did not prevent men
of the highest integrity from stating that it was undoubtedly
so.
<P>
There are real dangers associated with the psychedelic substances
known today. These dangers are of many kinds and call for concern
from medicine and its allied sciences. However, before discussing
these dangers and how they might be alleviated, it may be well
to remind those who urge medical men to make public pronouncements
to frighten and dismay the young that, given the morality of medicine,
its place in society, and the age of the experienced medical man,
the doctor is rarely the best person for the task. He is liable
to exaggerate such dangers as exist and is apt to aid and abet
extreme measures, in keeping with the morality of the day, that
may not alleviate the sufferings of the victims of the immoral
condition and may even make it worse.
<P>
Psychedelics are liable to arouse moral indignation, because emotions
are always likely to be deeply stimulated when someone else is
indulging in new pleasures that may alter social values, especially
when the users are young and rash and often brash as well. Medicine
has a duty not to make this confusion and uncertainty any worse.
Physicians are not police. Their duty is to inform the public
as truthfully as they can, without excessive bias, resounding
moral statements, or validation of punitive actions carried out
as treatment. Medicine must avoid becoming a precipitate partisan
in complex moral and social issues such as those posed by the
modern advent of psychedelics.
<P>
After such perplexities, it is tempting to leave the solution
to the reader's ingenuity. Yet authors customarily give their
opinion and venture at least a few steps beyond the threshold
of their ivory tower. The uses and dangers attending these substances
must be discussed accurately and dispassionately. Men like Dr.
Stanley Yolles, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health,
do not seem convinced that &quot;drug abuse,&quot; which includes
the unauthorized use of a variety of psychedelics, will be eliminated
in the foreseeable <A NAME="back1"></A>future. <A HREF="#footnote1">(1)</A>
If this is indeed so, strenuous efforts must be made to reduce
those dangers attendant on clandestine use. We require a variety
of social strategies rather than freezing in a catatonic posture
and boasting that this immobility is firm resolution. The very
brief banning of LSD-25 research in 1966 was a classic example
of precipitate, unintelligent action springing from high government
levels. Since then, some research has been restored to a limited
degree, but expansion has not been greatly encouraged, nor is
an atmosphere of panic and politicking conducive to clear thinking,
planning, and diligent, long-continued inquiry. Legitimate, rather
than amateur and bootleg, research is necessary; yet one of the
most gifted and distinguished researchers in the country was not
able to obtain permission to do this sort of work. Others, too,
have been discouraged by the sluggishness of the various bureaucracies
that must be consulted.
<P>
The muddled and ambiguous situation regarding the effect of LSD-25
on chromosomes<A NAME="back2"></A> <A HREF="#footnote2">(2)</A>
might call for restriction of research with this particular drug
to those people for whom such changes, if they do indeed occur,
would be of comparatively little importance. Other psychedelics,
which have never been implicated in this way, could be used more
widely. Subjects for LSD might include some of the several million
afflicted by severe and chronic alcoholism, patients suffering
from intractable pain in fatal illnesses (Kast, 1964a), and older
people still curious for new experience to enlarge their understanding
of themselves, others, and existence. While not everyone might
choose to die with his mind stimulated by LSD, as did Aldous Huxley
(Huxley, L. A., 1968), rather than dulled by morphine, such matters
call for careful consideration, for each of us owes God a death.
It is folly to restrict and hamper research in all directions
because it may be dangerous in some. If damage to chromosomes
should be proved, and this has not yet been done, some substances
may be less harmful than others, and it may be possible to discover
protective measures. As a number of medicines in regular use are
also suspect, and since some virus diseases and certain radiations
produce similar changes, inquiries here would serve a wider purpose.
Indeed, because of the possibility of chromosome-damaging substances
in various medicines and foods, it would be prudent to inquire
at once into such protective substances. For instance, it has
been shown (in animals) that the teratogenic effect of thalidomide
(Frank et al., 1963) can be prevented by greatly increasing the
intake of niacin (vitamin B3). It is not known if this protective
effect extends to humans, but if it does, the thalidomide tragedy,
in which so many babies were deformed, might have been simply
and cheaply avoided.
<P>
Many years ago, Carl Jung <A NAME="back3"></A><A HREF="#footnote3">(3)</A>
told one of us that by the middle years of life, childhood experience
had usually done its worst and became of lessened importance as
a source of intrapsychic distress. Queen Elizabeth I put it to
her godson, Sir John Harrington, who invented the water closet,
&quot;When thou dost feel creeping time at the gate, these fooleries
will please thee less.&quot; She also reflected, &quot;The days
of man's life are plumed with the feathers of death.&quot; As
the years pass by, many men and women become more concerned with
the purpose and meaning of life, rather than with the drive to
succeed in it. This is an important area of inquiry for psychedelic
research.
<P>
Just as important, and at present receiving just as little attention,
is our need to explore ways to help people prepare themselves
for the rapid, all-pervasive, social and technological changes
characteristic of our times. In terms of science and technology,
as compared with previous ages, many of us have lived through
the equivalent of centuries of change. This torrent of change
is itself anxiety provoking, for there are no structures to handle
the kinds of change that change the structures themselves. Few
moralists seem to have noticed yet that the progress of medicine
has made it harder for us to reflect upon death and so savor life
to the full. To come to terms with both life and death, each must
be measured with the cold eye of the reflective mind; change must
be faced.
<P>
Until about half a century ago, everyone everywhere was raised
in the ever-present shadow of death. The autobiographies, biographies,
and histories of forty years ago show that those plumed feathers
were never far away. Life and death were inseparables, the subject
of gossip and conversation. Many people were preparing themselves
for their own deaths all their lives, for, unhampered by insurance
statistics, they saw death as ever present. Death seems to have
become taboo today and has taken that place of secrecy from which
sex has just been freed. This exchange of prisoners seems hardly
worth while. It is usually possible to abstain from sex, should
one want to; death allows no abstentions. As a Ghanaian truck
driver put it, &quot;Death takes no bribes.&quot;
<P>
A generation has grown up in whose life death is an unfamiliar
and unnatural event, almost an affront. Their experience does
not countenance illness for which nothing can be done. But death
has only been postponed, not defeated, and has dominion over people
who have scarcely dared speak his name in polite company. Our
forebears linked holy living and holy dying, and considered the
two an art. In a society such as ours, which has become almost
idolatrous about living indefinitely, it is becoming bad taste
to discuss death. Our position is not unlike that in Victorian
love stories, in which the authors managed to write about love
and passion with few open references to sex7 although its absence
made its presence all the clearer.
<P>
Those concerned with the religious aspects of psychedelics should
make special efforts in this direction. Many members of the Establishment
are in their middle and later years, and there is little doubt
that they recognize that they &quot;owe God a death,&quot; in
spite of the efforts of their physicians and surgeons. Research
into these matters should be pursued with ardor, for while the
risks are small, the rewards are likely to be great. This still
leaves the question of whether these substances have ill effects
on the young and whether such ill effects can be much reduced,
easily corrected, or completely avoided. Since controlling the
manufacture, distribution, and use of psychedelics is still uncertain,
although their containment seems to be possible, at least for
the moment, even this might break down during the next few years,
as we noted earlier.
<P>
If Victor Gioscia (1969) is correct, and there is an LSD subculture,
the dangers, particularly to those under thirty, require very
careful consideration. Leaving out chromosome damage, perhaps
the most dramatic misfortune is the development of a schizophreniform
illness. There is no doubt that this can happen, though it is
not clear how often it does. Certain myths current among some
young drug takers increase the danger. One of the most unfortunate
is that the appropriate remedy for a bad trip is another one,
frequently with a larger dose than that which produced the first
one. This notion is on a par with the alcoholic slogan of having
a hair, or even the tail, of &quot;the dog that bit you.&quot;
The sensible response to a bad trip is not to have another, but
to seek competent advice and guidance without delay. Some people,
who are clearly developing schizophrenia and have disturbances
of perception (Hoffer and Osmond, 1966a) combined with usually
depressed mood changes, with anxiety and sometimes thinking difficulties,
take psychedelics because they have heard, or hope, that they
will help. The most probable outcome is a severe and prolonged
bad trip, or sometimes the precipitation of a more-severe and
acute illness. If these dangers were more widely known and understood,
many young people would avoid trying to treat themselves by these
desperate means and avoid much unhappiness and distress.
<P>
A number of simple and effective ways of exploring and measuring
perceptual anomalies, including the HOD (Hoffer and Osmond, 1961;
Kelm, Hoffer, and Osmond, 1967) and EWI (El-Meligi, l968a, 1968b;
El-Meligi and Osmond, in press) tests already exist. By means
of these and similar instruments, and by improving public knowledge
about schizophrenia, it should be possible to diagnose and treat
it far earlier and more successfully than usually happens today.
Delaying treatment or aggravating the condition with mixtures
of impure and often unknown chemicals in inept attempts at self-treatment
only makes things worse. However, by no means all, or even most,
who sample the bewildering array of often dubious substances said
to be psychedelic become gravely ill or likely to be so. Official
propaganda paints a uniformly gloomy picture, which paradoxically
increases rashness by its exaggeration. This same kind of overstatement
was used to discourage masturbation, sex, drinking, dancing, smoking,
using make-up, primping, and other disapproved activities. The
results have been unimpressive. However, even if it were shown
that there were few physiological objections to young people taking
pure and reliable psychedelics except for those with a tendency
to schizophrenia, it does not follow that all controls should
be removed.
<P>
Each one of us must learn his own culture before he can either
align himself with its values or object to them in a manner likely
to produce constructive change. In most cultures, the attainment
of this is symbolized by the accordance of certain rights, such
as the right to marry, hold property, vote, go to war, receive
the death penalty, and other positive and negative awards withheld
from children and those not sufficiently acculturated. In some
cultures, ceremonies take place to mark entry into adult status,
and ritual markings may also be applied in order to indicate the
status of the new adult. Psychedelics taken before the stabilization
of knowledge about cultural norms, because of their capacity to
alter perceptual constancy, might result in a reduced capacity
or wish to internalize the already fluctuating and fragmenting
values of our industrial society. The Establishment, by its hasty
and apparently not fully enforceable ban on these substances,
seems to have worsened matters by making them symbolic of intergenerational
differences.
<P>
Since the mistake has already been made, what can be done? Societies
that have sought and used psychedelic experience, however achieved,
have nearly always had some kind of initiation ceremony, often
of a religious kind, aimed at focusing expanded experience in
a way that will enhance the participant's identification with
and appreciation of his own society. In the United States at present,
only indigenous Indians are permitted a religion employing psychedelics,
and they have achieved this only by much stubborn courage. Surely
bona fide religious groups interested in these matters who are
prepared to conduct themselves in a manner in keeping with safety
and public decency, should be encouraged and supported. They are
likely to serve a valuable social function in the future. Even
the cynical who are not wholly myopic can understand that banned
and persecuted religions frequently spread more quickly and become
more attractive in times of change. Persecution, even with the
good intention of preserving health, is liable to have unintended
consequences. In his morality <I>Island</I>, Aldous Huxley (1962)
discussed these matters and illustrated them with the learning,
perceptiveness, wit, and delicacy in which he had few rivals.
<P>
Mankind's interest in the psychedelic experience is unlikely to
lessen with increase in leisure. This gives us a greater opportunity
to be concerned not only with survival, but with the quality of
those human relationships that are the stuff of life. Wasson (1969)
shows in his great book that this is one of mankind's oldest interests.
In the years that lie ahead, new drugs, although there will probably
be many more of them, will not, we think, be the focus of greatest
interest. Already various forms of hypnosis, learning-theory applications,
and electronics that evoke and reproduce these experiences are
being explored. Those young people who are alert to them and interested
will learn how to use them, and some may be doing so even now.
If this happens, the Establishment will have to decide whether
it disapproves of the chemicals producing the experience or the
experience itself. Very few of those dealing with these matters
legally, scientifically, or politically seem to have concerned
themselves with this critical issue. Medically, the non-drug methods
eliminate many of the current objections to the psychedelic experience
as a hazard to health. The social problems, however, especially
those of acculturation, would not necessarily be greatly changed
.
<P>
If such capacities, however induced, become widespread, their
impact is likely to resemble some massive mutation. Perhaps this
is necessary if we are to adapt to that new world that we are
building with such a strange mishmash of cunning, inspiration,
apprehension, and folly. The sociological, psychological, political,
and other consequences of psychedelic experience, however induced,
occurring in the majority or even a substantial minority of a
postindustrial population, is likely to affect most of us far
more than a few space jaunts for carefully selected heroes and
heroines. The record is merciless: practical men of sound sense
are nearly always wrong about the future, though never lacking
in certainty. While the winds of change strum to gale force around
us, they perform their ostrich acts and proclaim that they have
everything under control. But the gale does not blow itself out
because of their rhetoric, and to survive, we need to set a course
that carries us into the future. Some years ago one of us wrote
(Osmond, 1957a):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . these agents have a part to play in our survival as a species,
for that survival depends as much On our opinion of our fellows
and ourselves as on any other single thing. The psychedelics help
us to explore and fathom our own nature.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We can perceive ourselves as the stampings of an automatic socioeconomic
process, as highly plastic and conditionable animals, as congeries
of instinctive strivings ending in loss of sexual drive and death,
as cybernetic gadgets, or even as semantic conundrums. All of
these concepts have their supporters and they all have some degree
of truth m them. We may also be something more, &quot;a part of
the main,&quot; a striving sliver of a creative process, a manifestation
of Brahma in Atman, an aspect of an infinite God immanent and
transcendent within and without us. These very different valuings
of the self and of other people's selves have all been held sincerely
by men and women. I expect that even what seem the most extreme
notions are held by some contributors to these pages. Can one
doubt that the views of the world derived from such differing
concepts are likely to differ greatly, and that the courses of
action determined by those views will differ . . . ?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . I believe that the psychedelics provide a chance, perhaps
only a slender one, for homo faber, the cunning, ruthless, foolhardy,
pleasure-greedy toolmaker, to merge into that other creature whose
presence we have so rashly presumed, homo sapiens, the wise, the
understanding, the compassionate, in whose fourfold vision art,
politics, science, and religion are one. Surely we must seize
that chance....

(2) Today (July 1969) reports of chromosome changes are bewildering
to those not experts in this field. The various conflicting statements
suggest that the science of studying chromosomes requires an art
as great as that needed to interpret Rorschach inkblots. In that
famous and often valuable test, the non-expert must rely on his
own estimate of the reliability of the particular person who administered
and reported on the test. Great difficulties arise when men of
good repute publish findings that seem, at least to the naive,
to be diametrically opposed and irreconcilable. There is a danger
that, because of reports in the press based on earlier studies
that suggested unequivocal damage to chromosomes, some people
who were frightened away by this information will now decide that
there is no danger whatever. It may even be thought that this
was another trick like that deplorable episode in Pennsylvania,
where it was reported with considerable circumstantial detail
that a number of young men had gazed at the sun under the influence
of LSD-25 and were permanently blinded, suffering grave retinal
damage. This proved to be false. Thus are credibility crevasses
created. <A HREF="#back2">(Back)</A> <A NAME="footnote3"></A>

<p>THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS OF LSD AND RELATED DRUGS </p>

<p><i>Introduction by Peter Webster</i> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the mid-1960s, legislation in the United States
    instituted a prohibition on the use of psychedelic drugs, not
    only the supposedly alarming use by hippies, intellectuals,
    beatniks, college students, etc., but also use by scientific
    researchers and mental health professionals. The ban on
    practically all research and therapy was soon forced upon the
    rest of the world by international treaties and also, no
    doubt, by covert pressure from the CIA and other U.S.
    government agencies. LSD and the other psychedelic drugs were
    classed as &quot;Schedule 1&quot; substances, supposedly
    having no medical value or recognized uses. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Yet a significant body of scientific literature of the
    time indicated quite clearly that psychedelic drugs most
    certainly did have valuable uses in both therapy and pure
    research. Work that had been going on for more than a decade
    in Canada, for instance, had shown LSD psychotherapy to be
    the most effective treatment for alcoholism ever devised.
    Other studies had begun to show similar effectiveness for
    treatment of addictions, personality disorders, and a whole
    range of conditions. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A review of the pertinent scientific literature of the
    time is of great importance today, for a general review of
    the whole situation of the War on Drugs is increasingly
    leading to calls by important and influential individuals for
    a serious re-evaluation of that policy, if not an outright
    reversal leading to complete legalization of &quot;drugs of
    abuse&quot;. A close scrutiny of the basis and justification
    for the War on Drugs is revealing not only inconsistencies,
    but gross deception, blatant lies, and the worst kind of
    propaganda used to institute and promote that War. The
    recognized therapeutic applications of cannabis, for
    instance, are still being resisted by Drug Warriors in spite
    of evidence that would long ago have been sufficient to get
    government approval had cannabis been a &quot;new drug&quot;
    invented by a pharmaceutical company. Yet cannabis remains a
    Schedule 1 substance. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The following essay is the introductory section of a paper
    published in 1970 that reveals a similar, if not even greater
    ignorance in the current official attitude toward therapeutic
    use of the psychedelic drugs. The authors are noted
    scientific researchers who had been working with psychedelics
    for many years. Their work, like that of many others, was
    brought to an abrupt and premature conclusion by the
    anti-drug hysteria which still today, perhaps more than ever,
    is doing far more to poison Western Civilization than any
    sort of &quot;drug abuse&quot; could possibly do. </p>

<h1><em>TOWARD AN INDIVIDUAL PSYCHEDELIC PSYCHOTHERAPY</em> </h1>

<h4><em>by</em> <em>ROBERT E. L. MASTERS AND JEAN HOUSTON</em> * </h4>

<p>Widespread therapeutic use of LSD-25 and similar psychedelic
drugs did not begin until the 1950s. By 1965, there had appeared
in scientific journals more than two thousand papers describing
treatment, of thirty to forty thousand patients, with
psychedelics (Buckman, 1967). Since 1965, the literature has
continued to grow and now includes book-length works as well as
the shorter reports published in journals and anthologies. Yet
spokesmen for the American psychiatric establishment continue to
tell the public that there is no evidence to demonstrate the
value in therapy of psychedelic drugs. </p>

<p>Reports of therapeutic successes have come from hundreds of
psychotherapists working in many of the countries and cultures of
the world. The psychedelic drugs have been used as
&quot;adjuncts&quot; or &quot;facilitating agents&quot; to a
variety of existing psychotherapeutic procedures. Some efforts
have been made to develop new, psychedelic therapies specifically
grounded in the drug-state phenomena and the new models of the
psyche that have been suggested by the psychedelic experience. </p>

<p>The diversity of the approaches to therapeutic use of
psychedelics makes the evidence supporting their value for
therapy all the more impressive. Individuals and groups of
therapists of various persuasions have worked with one or more of
an ever-expanding family of psychedelic drugs and with a great
many drug combinations. Dosages administered have varied
enormously-in the case of LSD, anywhere from 10 to 1500mcg or
more. The psychedelic treatment has been considered as consisting
of from one to well over one hundred drug sessions. </p>

<p>In general, therapists working with small doses-such as 25-50
mcg of LSD-do so only to facilitate conventional therapy, most
often psychoanalysis. Such doses may heighten suggestibility and
facilitate recall, association, and emergence of unconscious
materials. This type of treatment might involve weekly sessions
that continue for months or even years. </p>

<p>When the very massive dose is administered-LSD: 750-1500
mcg-the intent is to achieve the therapeutic result in a single,
overwhelming session. The patient's values are changed and
personality otherwise altered by means of a transcendental-type
experience akin to a religious conversion. This type of treatment
has been used mostly with alcoholics. </p>

<p>Other therapists work with a &quot;moderate&quot; dose-LSD:
150-400 mcg. Exact dose is individually specified on the basis of
the patient's body weight, drug sensitivity (if that can be
determined ), and personality factors. The dose should be
sufficient to allow for a full range of psychedelic response; at
the same time, the patient should not be overwhelmed or made
confused or unable to communicate effectively. A brief therapy,
one or a few sessions in a few weeks or months, is the aim. </p>

<p>Types of conditions repeatedly stated to respond favorably to
treatment with psychedelics include chronic alcoholism, criminal
psychopathy, sexual deviations and neuroses, depressive states
(exclusive of endogenous depression), phobias, anxiety neuroses,
compulsive syndromes, and puberty neuroses. In addition,
psychedelics have been used with autistic children, to make them
more responsive and to improve behavior and attitudes; with
terminal cancer patients, to ease both the physical pain and the
anguish of dying; and with adult schizophrenics, to condense the
psychosis temporarily and to help predict its course of
development. </p>

<p>Almost all therapists reporting these successes have stated
that the incidence of recovery or significant improvement was
substantially greater than with other therapies used by them in
the past. The treatment typically required much less time and was
accordingly less costly for the patient. </p>

<p>Treatment with psychedelics has most often been described as
ineffective in cases of hysterical neurosis and hysteria,
stuttering neurosis, infantile personality, and long-term
neurotic invalidism. Despite reported successes, compulsive
syndromes, criminal psychopathy, and depressive states are also
mentioned as contraindicated. The risks frequently have been
considered too great for paranoids, severely depressed persons,
outpatient psychotics and prepsychotics, and those with a history
of suicide attempts or who may be currently suicidal. However, as
we have previously suggested (Masters and Houston, 1966),
psychedelic therapy may be indicated in cases where suicide seems
probable and imminent. By his being enabled to die symbolically
and then be reborn, the patient's need to die may be subsequently
eliminated. </p>

<p>That psychedelic drugs have value for psychotherapy has
usually been most vigorously challenged or denied by therapists
who have done no work at all with the drugs. Lack of adequate
controls to allow more-objective assessment frequently is
mentioned. However, it is very hard to devise fully satisfactory
controls where such drastic alterations of consciousness are
involved. Some veteran workers with psychedelics believe
meaningful controls to be impossible. On the other hand, what one
research team regards as adequate double-blind conditions has
been achieved by administering a light dose of LSD (50 mcg) to
the control group, while the experimental group received 450 mcg.
The small dose produced definite changes in consciousness but did
not permit a full-fledged psychedelic reaction (Unger, et al.,
1966). </p>

<p>Other charges from opponents of psychedelic therapy have
attributed bias and excessive enthusiasm to workers with the
drugs. Certainly, some of the early papers were extravagant, as
tends to happen with new therapies. But the time has long passed
when psychedelics could be hailed as a panacea; and it should be
remarked that the bias of the advocates only rarely approaches
that of some &quot;distinguished&quot; critics. Some of these
critics seem ideologically and emotionally threatened by
psychedelic therapy. This has been especially true of
psychiatrists heavily committed to psychoanalysis. Psychedelics
emerge at a time when analysis is increasingly under strong
attack. Much of the opposition to the drugs is thus
understandable, but also unjustifiable. </p>

<p>Finally, psychedelic therapy has been assailed as too
dangerous. Very definitely, the evidence does not bear this out;
and in fact, when the drugs are administered by those therapists
and researchers who are most effective, the &quot;dangers&quot;
are negligible. This is borne out by studies involving many
thousands of patients and experimental drug subjects.(1) </p>

<p>(1) For example, Pollard, J., Uhr, L, and Stern, E.(1965): no
&quot;persistent ill effects&quot; in experiments with eighty
subjects over a five-year period; Masters, R. E. L., and Houston,
J. (1966): no psychotic reactions or unfavorable after-effects in
206 sessions over a combined fifteen years of research; Unger,
S., et al. (1966): one adverse reaction in 175 cases treated, and
that one &quot;readily reversible&quot;; and Cohen, S. (1960): in
one thousand LSD administrations to experimental subjects, less
than one in one thousand psychotic reactions lasting over
forty-eight hours. In therapy patients, per one thousand
administrations, there were 1..2 attempted suicides, 0.4
successful suicide, and 1.8 psychotic reactions. The results
compared favorably with incidence of complications following
electroshock treatments in common use. As compared to almost any
other therapy, LSD seems outstandingly safe when properly used. </p>

<p>LSD PSYCHOTHERAPY AND ADDICTIONS </p>

<p><i>An excerpt from</i> </p>

<h5>THE HUMAN ENCOUNTER WITH DEATH </h5>

<p>Stanislav Grof M.D. &amp; Joan Halifax, Ph.D. </p>

<p>E.P. Dutton, publisher, New York 1977 </p>

<p>copyright 1977 by Grof &amp; Halifax </p>

<p>LSD patients who experienced profound feelings of cosmic unity
frequently developed a negative attitude toward the states of
mind produced by intoxication with alcohol and narcotics. In the
Spring Grove studies, where the number of LSD sessions was
restricted, there was a definite tendency among both alcoholics
and heroin addicts to discontinue their habit following a single
high-dose LSD session. In a more open-ended treatment situation
in the Psychiatric Research Institute in Prague, where it was
possible to administer serial LSD sessions, complete working
through of the perinatal material resulted in several instances
of lasting abstinence and deep restructuring of the alcoholic's
or addict's personality. </p>

<p>The insights of these patients concerning the nature of their
habits resembled those of persons with suicidal tendencies. After
they had discovered and experienced feelings of cosmic unity in
their sessions, they realized that the state they had really been
craving was transcendence and not drug intoxication. They
recognized a certain superficial similarity and overlap between
alcohol or heroin intoxication and the unitive feelings activated
by LSD, and began to see that their desire to seek these drugs
was based on confusing these two conditions. The elements that
these states seem to have in common are the diminution or
disappearance of various painful emotions and sensations,
emotional indifference toward one's past and future, and an
undifferentiated state of consciousness. On the other hand,
however, many essential characteristics of the unitive state are
not part of the experience of intoxication by alcohol or
narcotics. Instead of inducing a state of cosmic consciousness in
its entirety, these drugs produce a caricature that seems close
enough to mislead the individual involved and seduce him or her
into systematic abuse. Repeated administrations then lead to
biological addiction and damage the user physically, emotionally,
and socially. </p>

<p>After the experiences of ego death, abuse of alcohol or
narcotics as well as suicidal tendencies are seen as tragic
mistakes due to an unrec ognized and misunderstood spiritual
craving for transcendence. The presence of strong feelings of
this kind, as improbable as they might seem to those familiar
with the behavior patterns and life- styles of addicts and
alcoholics, can be illustrated by statistics from psychedelic
therapy. In the Spring Grove research, alcoholics and heroin
addicts had the highest incidence of mystical experiences of all
the studied groups, including neurotics, mental health
professionals, and individuals dying of cancer. <br>

<h3>TREATMENT OF ALCOHOLISM WITH PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY</h3>

<h4>ABRAM HOFFER</h4>

<p>From: PSYCHEDELICS, The Uses and Implications of Psychedelic
Drugs, edited by Bernard Aaronson and Humphry Osmond, Doubleday
&amp; Company, 1970. Copyright Aaronson &amp; Osmond.</p>

<hr>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>Alcoholics Anonymous, the great self-help group-therapy
movement, is the only established treatment for alcoholics. Until
much more is known about the personal (biochemical and
psychological), familial, and social factors that contribute to
alcoholism, so it will remain. Most new therapies are merely
adjunctive to AA and will continue to be so until it is shown
that they have therapeutic value when used alone. In my view,
psychedelic therapy is best used as a preparation for AA. </p>

<p>When Bill W. and Dr. Bob founded AA, alcoholism had not been
accepted as a disease, either by society at large or by the
medical profession. Society considered it a moral problem, but
found itself confronted with an interesting dilemma, for only a
small proportion of the total drinking society drank excessively.
No moral sanctions were required for the majority, who eventually
made social drinking an integral part of the culture. </p>

<p>The majority who remained moral drinkers could not understand
why a minority became intemperate or alcoholic. Moral sanctions
were applied on the premise that excessive drinking arose from
defects of character, defects of will, and defects in society.
These sanctions included education, persuasion, incarceration,
and banishment. Unfortunately, the most stringent measures had
little permanent effect, and the proportion of <i>the drinking
society</i> (a concept developed by Dr. H. Osmond) remained the
same or increased. Medicine also considered alcoholism a
non-disease. </p>

<p>The founders of AA introduced the medical model first to
alcoholics, later to society, and finally to the medical
profession. This concept was very appealing to alcoholics because
it gave them a satisfactory explanation for their misfortunes. If
they were sick and not evil, then they might expect the same sort
of treatment they would receive if they developed pneumonia or
diabetes. Bill W. and Dr. Bob also introduced the concept of
allergy, which thirty-five years ago was incorporated into
medicine as a new group of diseases. <a href="#footnote1">(1)</a>
</p>

<p>But AA insisted that alcoholism was more than a physical
illness. It also carried strong personal responsibility. An
alcoholic could not be censured for being an alcoholic, but he
could be for doing nothing about it. </p>

<p>Society resisted the idea that alcoholics are sick, since it
got no guidance from a reluctant medical profession. Doctors
expect diseases to be more or less definable, to have treatment
that may be ineffective but must be in common use, and to have a
predictable prognosis. When they became convinced that AA did
help large numbers of alcoholics remain sober, they gradually
accepted alcoholics as patients. Even now, the majority of
hospitals are extremely reluctant to admit alcoholics who are
drunk, and many doctors dread seeing them in their offices.
Eventually AA forced the profession to accept the fact that
alcoholism, which has been estimated to afflict 5 per cent of the
population, is a disease. This marked the beginning of the final
solution to the problem. For, having accepted the disease
concept, doctors were challenged by the enormous problems, and,
in a matter of a few years, several major therapeutic discoveries
were made. </p>

<p>The newer adjunctive therapies developed for alcoholism may be
divided into the psychological and the biochemical.
Psychotherapy, deconditioning therapy, and psychedelic therapy
are examples of purely psychological therapy, while sugar-free
diets for relative hypoglycemia, mega vitamin B3, megascorbic
acid, and adrenocortical extracts (or extracts of licorice) are
examples of pure chemotherapies. </p>

<p>Psychedelic therapy is the only therapy that has prepared
alcoholics to become responsible members of AA, when previously
they had been unable to do so. </p>

<h5>Psychedelic Therapy</h5>

<p>We must distinguish sharply between psychedelic reactions and
the means for inducing them. Failure to understand this
distinction has led to several futile researches, best
exemplified by the study of Smart and Storm (1964), which was
widely circulated in an extreme form before publication of the
watered-down version. </p>

<p>Psychedelic therapy refers to a form of psychotherapy in which
hallucinogenic drugs are used in a particular way to facilitate
the final goal, which for alcoholics is sobriety. The drugs may
be mescaline, LSD, psilocybin, and many others, as well as
combinations. It is therefore trivial to test the effect of LSD
or other hallucinogens on alcoholics in such a way that there is
no psychedelic reaction. In fact, these trivial experiences have
led to trivial data, as reported by Smart et al. (1966), who
claimed that a group of ten alcoholics given LSD did not differ
in outcome from a group of ten given another psychoactive drug.
Close examination of their report shows that no therapy was
given, nor was there any encouragement of discussion of problems.
The experience was not psychedelic, but was more in the nature of
an inquisition, with the subject strapped to the bed, pretreated
with dilantin, and ill from 800 mcg of LSD. Since no investigator
has ever claimed that LSD used in this way does have any
therapeutic effect, this experiment suggests that LSD used with
no therapeutic intent or skill is not apt to help. One of the
subjects given LSD by Smart et al. described his experience in
comparison with a psychedelic reaction he received from smaller
quantities of LSD in Saskatchewan. The experiences and the
outcome were quite different. </p>

<p>Psychedelic therapy aims to create a set and a setting that
will allow proper psychotherapy. The psychedelic therapist works
with material that the patient experiences and discusses, and
helps him resynthesize a new model of life or a new personal
philosophy. During the experience, the patient draws upon
information flooding in from the altered environment and from his
own past, and uses it to eliminate false ideas and false
memories. With the aid of the therapist, he evaluates himself
more objectively and becomes more acutely aware of his own
responsibility for his situation and, even more important, for
doing something about it. He also becomes aware of inner
strengths or qualities that help him in his long and difficult
struggle toward sobriety. </p>

<p>The book <i>The Use of LSD in Psychotherapy and Alcoholism</i>,
edited by H. A. Abramson (1967), contains the best collection of
scientific papers on psychedelic therapy. </p>

<p>Around 1952, Osmond and I had become familiar with
psychotomimetic reactions induced by LSD. There was a marked
similarity between these reactions and schizophrenia and the
toxic psychoses. Delirium tremens is one of the common toxic
states. It occurred to us that LSD might be used to produce
models of dt's. Many alcoholics ascribed the beginning of their
recovery to &quot;hitting bottom,&quot; and often &quot;hitting
bottom&quot; meant having had a particularly memorable attack of
dt's. We thought that LSD could be used this way with no risk to
the patient. We treated our first two alcoholics at the
Saskatchewan Hospital, Weyburn, Saskatchewan, and one recovered. </p>

<p>Other early pilot studies were encouraging, and we increased
the tempo of our research until at one time six of our major
psychiatric centers in Saskatchewan were using it. As of now, we
must have treated close to one thousand alcoholics. </p>

<p>Within a few years after our first patients were treated, we
became aware that a large proportion of our alcoholics did not
have psychotomimetic reactions. Their experiences were exciting
and pleasant, and yielded insight into their drinking problems.
It became evident that a new phenomenon had been recognized in
psychiatry. Osmond created the word psychedelic to define these
experiences, and announced this at a meeting of the New York
Academy of Sciences in 1957. </p>

<p>Following this, our researches were aimed at improving the
quality and quantity of psychedelic reactions. Within the past
ten years, major studies, under the direction of Dr. Ross
MacLean, Hollywood Hospital, New Westminster, British Columbia,
and under the direction of Dr. S. Unger at Spring Grove State
Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, have added materially to our
knowledge of the effect of psychedelic therapy on alcoholism. </p>

<p>I will not review the results of psychedelic therapy in
detail. This has been done in the books edited by H. A. Abramson
and in <i>The Hallucinogens</i> by A. Hoffer and H. Osmond
(1967). The one striking conclusion is that every scientist using
psychedelic therapy with alcoholics found the same proportion of
recoveries. Whether the experiments were considered controlled or
not, about 50 per cent were able to remain sober or to drink much
less. This seems to be a universal statistic for LSD therapy. </p>

<p>(1). Dr. Walter Alvarez recently told me that when he wrote a
paper on food allergies at the Mayo Clinic about fifty years ago,
he was severely criticized by his colleagues. Only strong support
from one of the Mayos, who discovered that he himself had a food
allergy, protected Alvarez from even-more-powerful assault.
Medicine seems very reluctant to take unto itself new diseases. <a

<h3 align="center">THE USE OF PSYCHEDELIC AGENTS WITH<br>
AUTISTIC SCHIZOPHRENIC CHILDREN </h3>

<h5 align="center">Evidence from seven independent studies

<h6 align="center">Robert Mogar, Ph.D., is Associate Professor of
Psychology at San Francisco State College, and former Director of

graduate student in psychology at San Francisco State College.</h6>

<h6 align="center">Reprinted from <i>PSYCHEDELIC REVIEW</i>
Number 10, 1969</h6>

<hr>

<p>In recent years, a number of exploratory investigations have
been reported involving the administration of psychedelic agents
to young children suffering from severe forms of psychological
disturbance (Abramson, 1960; Bender, et al., 1962; Bender, et
al., 1963; Fisher &amp; Castile, 1963; Freedman, et al., 1962;
Rolo, et al., 1965; Simmons, et al., 1966). As either therapeutic
or experimental undertakings, these studies are extremely
fragmentary and suffer gross shortcomings. As a case in point,
wide diversity along major dimensions known to influence drug
response and treatment effectiveness characterize this work.
These include the agent employed, dosage level, number and
frequency of administrations, therapist expectations and previous
experience with psychedelic drugs, and finally the setting and
circumstances surrounding the drug-induced state. With regard to
patient characteristics, the children treated were
demographically varied and covered a broad age range. More
importantly, the samples were markedly heterogeneous with respect
to the nature, severity, and duration of modal symptoms. The
major experimental shortcomings included small samples,
subjective and vague criteria of drug effects and improvement,
and grossly inadequate follow-up. </p>

<p>Despite their diversity and severe limitations, these seminal
explorations in an extremely complex area of research seem worthy
of wider reportage and more serious attention than they have
hitherto received. Almost without exception, these reports have
appeared in obscure publications or remain unpublished. A more
significant reason for their relative neglect has been the
polarized controversy surrounding psychedelic agents which has
all but completely curtailed publicly-sanctioned research. </p>

<p>In this critique of the use of psychedelic agents with
severely disturbed children, the various studies conducted thus
far will be comprehensively reviewed and integrated. Particular
attention will be given to their similarities and differences
along known relevant dimensions in order to detect communalities
and possible reasons for inconsistent findings. While some
attempt will be made to resolve seemingly contradictory results,
the heuristic value of this work will be emphasized rather than
its conclusiveness . Hopefully, the tentative conclusions derived
from these initial efforts will point the way for more definitive
studies into the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelic agents with
childhood disorders. </p>

<h5 align="center">PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS</h5>

<p>A fairly exhaustive search of clinical and research reports
revealed a total of 91 severely disturbed children who have been
administered one or more psychedelic agents for experimental
and/or therapeutic purposes. As detailed in <a href="#Table1">Table
1</a>, this collective group of patients ranged from five to
fifteen years of age, with the large majority between six and ten
years of age. Careful examination of the seven independent
studies disclosed little basis for assuming a significant
relationship between age and drug response. However, tentative
relationships were suggested by both Bender (1963) and Fisher and
Castile (1963). Bender noted that in contrast to pre-
adolescents, younger children manifest consistently different
reactions to a variety of medical and pharmacological treatments.
For this reason, she hypothesized that her older patient group
(12-15, N = 8) would not show the dramatic positive changes
obtained with the younger children. Contrary to expectations,
comparable favorable effects were found irrespective of age
differences. Fisher and Castile, on the other hand, concluded
that older children were better candidates for psychedelic
therapy because verbal communication was possible and also
because they tended to be less withdrawn, more schizophrenic than
autistic, and displayed more blatant symptomology. While these
patient features were obvious advantages for the particular
therapy technique employed by Fisher and Castile, it is unlikely
that this symptom picture consistently distinguishes older from
younger psychotic children. Thus, on the basis of the available
evidence concerning the immediate and subsequent effects of
psychedelic drugs on children, age per se appears to be an
inconsequential variable. </p>

<p>All of the patients treated in these studies were described as
severely and chronically disturbed with a primary diagnosis of
autism or childhood schizophrenia. With regard to duration of
illness, most had been hospitalized for periods ranging from two
to four years. Many were afflicted since birth. An apparent
exception was the single patient studied by Rolo and his co-
workers (1965). This twelve year old boy had been hospitalized
for four months. No estimate of the duration of his illness was
reported. At the opposite extreme, the twelve children treated by
Fisher and Castile were probably the most severely disturbed with
an average illness duration of 7.6 years. </p>

<p>The modal symptoms characterizing the majority of children
given psychedelic treatment were well summarized by Simmons and
his coworkers (1966): (1) preoccupation with and stereotyped
manipulation of objects (toys, etc.); (2) isolation of the self
from contact with animate objects (including minimal eye
contact); (3) failure to acquire general social behaviors
(including speech); and (4) bizarre rhythmic repetitive motor
patterns. This syndrome conforms closely to the classical picture
of infantile autism (see e.g., Rimland, 1964). As suggested
earlier, the symptoms picture of the older children treated by
Bender and by Fisher and Castile resembled adult schizophrenia
more than infantile autism. This was also true of Rolo's single
patient. Although autism was invariably present, the
&quot;schizophrenic&quot; children were less withdrawn and
manifested a greater variety of symptoms including overt
aggression, hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and psychosomatic
disturbances. Almost without exception, long-standing mutism was
characteristic of all 91 patients prior to psychedelic treatment.
</p>

<p>Despite these significant communalities among the seven groups
of children studied, individual differences in patient
characteristics extended over a fairly broad range. Without
discounting the possible importance of individual differences,
there is little indication in the work reviewed here of
differential response or benefit as a function of age, diagnosis,
duration or severity of illness. As will become apparent in
subsequent sections of this paper, the failure to detect such
relationships seems partlydueto fragmentary patient data and the
crude estimates available of drug response and subsequent changes
in behavior. Consistent with this hypothesis, the differential
findings reported by Fisher and Castile appear to reflect their
more detailed assessment of personal history information and
individual differences in both pre- and post- treatment
symptomology. They also applied more stringent criteria of
improvement than the other investigators. </p>

<h5 align="center">RATIONALE AND HYPOTHESES</h5>

<p>Explicit hypotheses or theoretical bases for administering
psychedelic drugs to disturbed children are almost completely
absent in these exploratory studies. The lack of a definite
rationale is hardly surprising when one considers the enigma
surrounding both schizophrenic behavior in children and response
to psychedelic drugs. Despite great diversity in expectations
andtechnique,there was one point of departure shared by all
investigators, namely, that all known forms of treatment had been
attempted without success. Thus, the use of a potent experimental
drug with the particular chronic patients selected seemed
justified. </p>

<p>With regard to the purpose of these studies, all were to some
extent exploring the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs
rather than their psychotomimetic properties. This was least true
of Freedman and his coworkers (1962) who viewed LSD primarily as
a means of studying the schizophrenic process by
&quot;intensifying pre-existing symptomology.&quot; This
orientation contrasted sharply with Bender's view. Noting that
withdrawn children became more emotionally responsive while
aggressive children became less so, she hypothesized that
psychedelic drugs &quot;tend to 'normalize' behavior rather than
subdue or stimulate it.&quot; This basic difference in
expectations seems at least partially responsible for Bender's
extremely favorable outcomes and Freedman's rather poor results.
Regarding all forms of psychotherapy, it has become a truism that
&quot; where there is no therapeutic intent, there is no
therapeutic result&quot; (Charles Savage in Abramson, 1960, p.
193). </p>

<p>Consistent with their explicit therapeutic intent, Bender,
Fisher, and Simmons each offer essentially the same hypothesis
based on a psychological interpretation of childhood
schizophrenia: &quot; The working hypothesis of this study is
that the psychosis is a massive defensive structure in the
service of protecting and defending the patient against his
feelings and affectual states&quot; (Fisher &amp; Castile, 1963).
Psychedelic drugs were viewed as a powerful means of undermining
an intractable defense system and thereby making the patient more
receptive to contact and communication with others. In attempting
to explain the predominantly positive results in this area of
research (see Table 1), it is worth emphasizing that the
collective work of Bender, Fisher, and Simmons accounts for over
75 per cent of the 91 children treated with psychedelic drugs.
Although their techniques differed considerably, these
investigators shared a psychological conception of autistic
symptoms and a psycho-therapeutic orientation to drug treatment. </p>

<p>Although Freedman was prompted to use LSD primarily as an
experimental device to study psychosis, he did mention that he
was influenced to some extent by the dramatic improvement in
autistic children reported by Peck and Murphy (in Abramson, 1960)
and by the apparent success of Cholden, Kurland, and Savage
(1955) in their work with adult mute catatonic patients. As will
become apparent in the discussion of results, a partial and often
transient alleviation of mutism by LSD treatment has been one of
the most consistent effects reported in the children studies. </p>

<p>A final secondary objective worth mentioning is that the more
recent studies (Rolo, et al., 1965; Simmons, et al., 1966) were
influenced by Bender' s earlier reports of successful LSD
treatment. These studies were attempts to replicate Bender's
findings using various control measures and other methodological
refinements. </p>

<h5 align="center">DRUG REGIME</h5>

<p>As indicated in Table 1, LSD-25 has been by far the most
frequently employed psychedelic agent in work with psychotic
children. An exception was Benders s second study (1963) in which
she gave one-half of her patients LSD-25 and the other half UM
L491. The experimental drug UML-491 was described as a more
potent serotonin inhibitor without the psychedelic properties
associated with LSD-25. Based on a variety of biochemical indices
and observations of differential behavior changes, Bender
reported no apparent differences between the action or
effectiveness of the two drugs. </p>

<p>Fisher and Castile employed LSD-25 and psilocybin at times
singly and at times simultaneously. These investigators were
unique in using a variety of dosage leveldrug combinations both
with the same patient on different occasions and with different
patients on the same occasion. The specific drug regime adopted
for a given session was determined by clinical criteria of the
patient' s particular defense structure and his expected
resistance to psychedeliedrugs. Stated differently, Fisher and
Castile were the only investigators who attempted to optimize the
psychedelic experience for a given patient rather than
mechanically administering a constant dosage of the same agent to
all patients. This feature of their method was consistent with
the greater attention paid to individual patient differences and
their general orientation to psychedelic therapy as a
psychopharmacological process . </p>

<p>Concerning dosage level, most investigators settled on 100
micrograms as optimal. Although this was the average dosage used
by Bender, she differed from the others by starting treatment at
a relatively low level (50 mcgs.) and gradually increasing the
amount to as high as 150 mcgs. As suggested earlier, Fisher and
Castile usually administered multiple agents and employed a wide
range of dosage levels (with LSD, 50 to 400 mcgs.). As their work
progressed, they developed a definite preference for the
prolonged high dose psychedelic experience, especially with older
schizophrenic children. Their most effective results were
obtained with pre-treatment medication of 10 mg. Librium, 10 to
15 mg. of Psilocybin given approximately one-half hour later,
followed by 250 to 300 mcg. of LSD administered twenty minutes
later. In addition, Fisher and Castile often gave
&quot;boosters&quot; during the session itself ranging from 25 to
100 mcg. of LSD. Boosting was considered beneficial &quot; (a)
when the patient seemed to be caught up in a problem area which
he could not break through; (b) when the patient kept defending
himself from new experiences; (c) when the patient increased his
defensive, stereotyped behavior and the psychotic controls became
intensified.&quot; </p>

<p>With regard to frequency and total number of treatments, the
seven studies varied widely ---from Freedman's single session per
patient to Bender's daily sessions over periods as long as one
year. Although more frequent and prolonged treatment was often
impossible for non- clinical reasons, Fisher' s group averaged
five sessions per patient given preferably at two week intervals.
With both Rolo' s single patient and Simmons' pair of identical
twins, experimental requirements precluded an optimal therapeutic
regime. Both investigators attempted double-blind procedures and
more objective observational methods. Rolo administered 100 mcg.
LSD on 28 consecutive days while Simmons gave a total of nine 50
mcg. LSD treatments, approximately two per week, interspersed
with inert placebo sessions and control (no-drug) trials. </p>

<p>After citing extensive evidence indicating rapid tolerance of
LSD-25, Freedman concluded that repeated administrations would be
ineffective with psychotic children. Bender, on the other hand,
found little indication of either rapid or sustained tolerance to
LSD using her method of continued daily adrninistrations over
extended periods. With her relatively large group of patients,
Bender did observe a leveling off of reactivity after several
weeks or months of uninterrupted treatment. She considered it
unlikely, however, that this effect was due to physiological drug
tolerance. The impressive improvement rates obtained by Bender in
contrast to Freedman's results offer support for a high frequency
regime of moderately large doses. It is worth noting that Fisher
and Castile arrived at a similar conclusion without knowledge of
Bender's work. Parenthetically, the significance of a possible
drug tolerance effect is further lessened by the findings of more
recent experiments indicating that tolerance to LSD diminishes
almost as rapidly as it develops (Hoffer, 1965) . </p>

<h5 align="center">PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MILIEU</h5>

<p>It should be emphasized that the findings obtained in these
studies are the result of an interrelated set of determinants,
only one of which is the ingestion of a particular chemical
agent. The significance of seemingly contradictory results has
often been obscured by the persistent search for static, &quot;
drug-specific&quot; reactions to LSD. Inconsistent findings
become more understandable if the psychedelic experience is
viewed as a dynamic configuration of intimate patient
therapist-milieu transactions. In short, the administration of
LSD is inextricably embedded in a larger psychosocial process
which should be optimized in accordance with particular treatment
goals. </p>

<p>Even a cursory examination of the work with autistic children
clearly reveals that at least some important aspects of the
physical and psychological milieu were considerably less than
optimal. In the seven studies reviewed here, only Fisher and
Castile attempted to create a specifically non-medical atmosphere
that was minimally threatening to the patient. Modeled after the
widely-adopted Saskatchewan technique (Blewett &amp; Chwelos,
1959; Hoffer, 1965), the procedure developed by Fisher and
Castile included the following key features: (1) a high dose, 7
to 10 hour session; (2) the use of a variety of
therapeutically-meaningful or aesthetically- pleasing stimuli
(music, flowers, pictures, food, etc.); (3) a positive
patient-therapist relationship formed prior to the session
itself; (4) the presence of both a male and female therapist who
&quot;had thorough acquaintance with the phenomena of the drug
through personal experience&quot;; and (5) active therapist
involvement with the patient including role-playing (e.g.,
father, mother). Importantly, these conditions have repeatedly
been found to significantly enhance the personal value of
psychedelic experiences. </p>

<p>In each study, the circumstances under which the session was
conducted were consistent with the purpose and expectations of
the investigator. Consistent with his psychotomimetic
orientation, Freedman' s patients were supervised by a familiar
psychiatrist primarily for the purpose of careful observation and
note-taking. No attempts to relate to the children or personal
experience with the drug were reported. The same applies to
Bender's group although the intent in this case was clearly
therapeutic. She apparently administered LSD as a conventional
daily medication that did not require any special conditions of
preparation, therapist involvement, or setting. However, her
reports are replete with descriptions of spontaneous interactions
between staff and children. Supervision of Bender' s patients was
performed mainly by ward attendants. The adults present in the
sessions conducted by both Rolo and Simmons were also ward
attendants. </p>

<p>The primary purpose of the studies reported by Rolo and
Simmons was explicitly methodological. Both research projects
employed the double-blind method and attempted to follow a
predetermined, uniform procedure during each experimental and
control session. As means of standardizing the sequence of events
and increasing objectivity, both investigators systematically
presented various playing objects, games, and tasks to the child.
Rolo's single patient was encouraged to engage in quite simple,
familiar activities such as throwing a baseball or playing cards.
Simmons, on the other hand, created a far more elaborate series
of game-like situations that were novel and intrinsically
interesting, requiring sustained patient-adult interactions, and
importantly were specifically designed to simulate or elicit
normal social behavior and emotional responsiveness. </p>

<p>A number of probable effects of the physical and psychological
milieu are suggested in these studies that bear a significant
relationship to the investigator' s orientation, on the one hand,
and differences in benefit or outcome, on the other. As indicated
earlier, the expectations of a particular research team seem
highly related to various aspects of both drug regime and
setting. With regard to differential improvement rates, a major
determinant seems to be the degree of active therapist-patient
interactions permitted during the drug-induced state. Secondly,
greater therapeutic benefit seems to occur in congenial settings
offering some opportunity to experience meaningful objects and
interpersonal activities. Finally, psychedelic therapy with
psychotic children seems most effective in natural, flexible
settings that are reasonably free of artificiality, experimental
restrictions on spontaneous behavior, and mechanically
administered procedures. Conversely, barren medical or laboratory
environments seem clearly anti- therapeutic. </p>

<h5 align="center">RESULTS</h5>

<p>As emphasized previously, each of these exploratory studies
suffered major shortcomings either as therapeutic or experimental
undertakings. Almost without exception, the findings reported
consist mainly of observational data obtained during the acute
phase of drug reactivity. The use of pre-treatment baselines
against which to measure change either during or after
psychedelic therapy were generally absent. In most cases,
follow-up data was not obtained. Although caution in interpreting
results is certainly indicated, it should be pointed out that
these limitations are shared by the bulk of research on drug- and
psycho-therapies. Furthermore, objective evaluation of
improvement in severely disturbed children presents unique
problems due to the nature of autistic symptoms, especially the
ubiquity of mutism. Even the few cases not suffering from a
complete absence of speech were untestable by standard
psychological assessment methods. </p>

<p>In their initial study, Bender and her coworkers (1962)
administered the Vineland Maturity Scale at the beginning of
treatment and again three months later. At the followup testing,
ratings were qualitatively higher for all children. In the second
study (Bender, et al., 1963), the Rorschach, Draw-A-Person, and
Bender-Gestalt tests were given to the ten verbally responsive
children on at least two occasions; before treatment and again
after a three to eight month interval. In these aggressive,
overtly psychotic patients, Bender reports that &quot;there were
two major changes observed: (1) There was a decrease in
personalized ideation and a corresponding gain in accuracy of
response; and (2) An inhibition of strongly emotional or
'feeling' reactions to the cards.&quot; Other favorable changes
reported included decreases in hallucinations, negativism, and
regressive defenses with a corresponding increase in reality-
contact. Similar types of improvement were found in the older
children treated by Fisher and Castile. </p>

<p>With regard to her major group of young autistic children,
Bender reported significant improvement in speech and verbal
communication: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;. . .the vocabularies of several of the children
    increased after LSD or UML; several seemed to be attempting
    to form words or watched adults carefully as they spoke; many
    seemed to comprehend speech for the first time or were able
    to communicate their needs... Very few of these changes in
    communication had been noted previously in such a large
    number of children, and at such a relatively rapid rate&quot;
    (1963, p. 91). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since mutism is a cardinal symptom of autistic children and
probably the major impediment to successful therapy, it is worth
emphasizing that at least temporary speech improvement has been
one of the most frequently reported effects of LSD in the work
conducted thus far. Other communalities include an elevated mood,
less compulsive ritualistic behavior, and increased interaction
with others. All investigators reported some favorable change in
these major areas with the exception of Rolo' s single patient .
Rolo's group abandoned the attempt to estimate improvement since
their judges could not distinguish between LSD and non- LSD
trials. Bender, on the other hand, made the following
observations: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot; They appeared flushed, bright eyed, and unusually
    interested in the environment... They participated with
    increasing eagerness in motility play with adults and other
    children. . . They seek positive contacts with adults,
    approaching them with face uplifted and bright eyes, and
    responding to fondling, affection, etc.&quot; (1962, pp. 172-
    3). &quot;There is less stereotyped whirling and rhythmic
    behavior. . . They became gay, happy, laughing frequently...
    Some showed changes in facial expression in appropriate
    reactions to situations for the first time&quot; (1963, pp.
    90-91). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As indicated earlier, Simmons' patients were subjected to a
uniform sequence of game- like situations that evoked a variety
of measurable responses. During each LSD session and non- LSD
session, a total of 20 specific behavioral measurements were
taken by a recorder observing the patient through a one-way,
screen. The behaviors recorded included physical contact with the
adult present, vocalizations, destructive acts, laughter,
stereotyped movements, and eye-to-eye contact. In contrast to
non-LSD trials, the most pronounced and consistent changes
observed during LSD sessions were: &quot;(1) An increase in
social behaviors manifested by increased eye to face contact and
increased responsiveness to adults, (2) An increase in smiling
and laughing behavior generally considered an indication of a
pleasurable affective state, and (3) a decrease in one form of
non-adaptive behavior demonstrated by a reduction of
self-stimulation.&quot; </p>

<p>Considering the wide diversity in these studies, the major
findings of Bender, Fisher and Castile, Freedman, and Simmons are
remarkably similar. Differences in orientation, patient
attributes, drug regime, setting, treatment technique, research
design, etc. seem to affect the frequency and stability of
favorable outcomes (see Table 1). The types of improvement, when
and if they occur, appear to be essentially the same in each
study. In short, when LSD is effective with autistic children, it
is effective in characteristic ways. </p>

<p>The influence of non-drug factors is well illustrated in the
work of Fisher and Castile. Although they optimized the physical
and psychological milieu, their patients were the most severely
disturbed and displayed the greatest variety of symptoms.
Furthermore they made conservative estimates of improvement based
on the extent and stability of favorable changes after treatment
was terminated. In contrast, most of the findings reported by the
other investigators concerned the immediate effects of treatment.
These differences account in part for the relatively modest
improvement rates reported by Fisher and Castile. </p>

<p>The lack of even short-term follow-up data on the majority of
children treated with psychedelic drugs has been a major
limitation of the work reviewed bere. Follow-up information is
particularly crucial because the available evidence strongly
suggests that when used alone, LSD produces only transient
alleviation of symptoms. In order to bring about enduring
improvement, the drug induced state requires active therapist
patient interaction and/or subsequent psychotherapy. In this
connection, Simmons noted that: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot; Therapeutic intervention in severely retarded or
    regressed children utilizes to a great extent close physical
    interaction to which the child must respond. In the usual
    state it is often difficult to intrude upon the child because
    of a general lack of responsiveness... The results of our
    experiments clearly demonstrate changes in exactly these
    areas with increased attendance to physical and face contact
    with an attending adult and concomitant reduction of
    competing self- stimulatory behavior... Thus, two possible
    criteria for the successful intervention into autistic
    children are met... A third piece of data which must be
    considered is the increase in smiling and laughing behavior.
    . .&quot; (1966, p. 1207). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The collective work reviewed here supports the main conclusion
reached by Simmons and his co-workers and argues strongly for
more extensive and systematic applications of psychedelic drugs
in the treatment of autistic schizophrenic children: &quot;
LSD-25 appears to offer a useful adjunct to psychotherapy because
of its positive effect in the areas described which are closely
related to the process of psychotherapy.&quot; </p>

<h5 align="center">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</h5>

<p>1. Seven independent studies are reviewed involving a total of
91 austistic schizophrenic children who had been given
psychedelic drugs for therapeutic and/or experimental purposes. </p>

<p>2. The large majority of children treated in these studies
were between six and ten years of age and were completely
refractory to all other forms of treatment. </p>

<p>3. There was only slight indication of any differential
response or benefit as a function of age, diagnosis, duration or
severity or illness. </p>

<p>4. A variety of psychedelic agents, dosage levels, frequency
of administrations, and treatment schedules were employed. The
most effective results were obtained with at least 100 microgram
doses of LSD-25 given daily or weekly over relatively extended
periods of time. </p>

<p>5. Concerning the physical and psychological milieu, greater
therapeutic benefit was related to: (a) the degree of active
therapist involvement with the patient; (b) an opportunity to
experience meaningful objects and interpersonal activities; and
(c) congenial settings that were reasonably free of
artificiality, experimental or medical restructions, and
mechanically administered procedures. </p>

<p>6. The most consistent effects of psychedelic therapy reported
in these studies included: (a) improved speech behavior in
otherwise mute children; (b) increased emotional responsiveness
to other children and adults; (c) an elevation in positive mood
including frequent laughter; and (d) decreases in compulsive
ritualistic behavior. </p>

<p>7. Differences in patient attributes, treatment technique,
research design, and other non- drug factors seemed to effect the
frequency and stability of favorable outcomes. The types of
improvement found were essentially the same in each study. </p>

<p>8. Although each of these studies contained serious
therapeutic and experimental flaws, it was concluded that the
collective findings argue strongly for more extensive
applications of psychedelic drugs in the treatment of austistic
children. </p>

<p>THE HISTORY OF PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY WITH THE DYING </p>

<p><i>by</i> </p>

<p><i>STANISLAV GROF, M.D. &amp; JOAN HALIFAX, Ph.D.</i> </p>

<p><i>Chapter 2 of </i>THE HUMAN ENCOUNTER WITH DEATH </p>

<p><i>E.P. DUTTON, NEW YORK 1977, copyright Grof &amp; Halifax</i>
</p>

<p>Our experience with persons dying of incurable diseases has
been closely associated with the development of psychedelic
therapy, a comprehensive program of brief psychotherapy utilizing
mind-altering substances such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
and dipropyltryptamine (DPT). Although this treatment is a direct
outgrowth of modern pharmacological and clinical research, it has
close parallels in various contemporary non-Western cultures and
its roots reach back to prehistory and the shamanic rituals and
healing ceremonies of many ancient civilizations. </p>

<p>The first suggestion that psychedelic substances could be
useful in the therapy of individuals dying of incurable diseases
came from pediatrician Valentina Pavlovna Wasson. After many
years of intensive ethnomycological studies, she and her husband,
Gordon Wasson, became interested in the use of psychedelic
mushrooms in pre-Columbian cultures and in contemporary Central
America. They made several field trips to Mexico to explore this
issue, and finally in June 1955 they became the first Westerners
to be admitted to a sacred ritual conducted by the Mazatec <i>curandera</i>,
or medicine woman, Maria Sabina. The Wassons were deeply
impressed by the powerful effect of the mushrooms that they
ingested in this ceremony. Roger Heim, the French mycologist
whose aid the Wassons sought, identified the mushrooms
botanically as <i>Psilocybe mexicana</i> and its congeners; he
then sent samples to the laboratories of the Swiss pharmaceutical
company, Sandoz, for chemical analysis. In 1957 Valentina
Pavlovna Wasson gave an interview in <i>This Week</i> magazine
about the history of this discovery and her own experience after
the ingestion of the Mexican sacred mushrooms. She expressed the
opinion that if the active agent could be isolated and a
sufficient supply assured, it might become a vital tool in the
study of psychic processes. She also stated that as the drug
would become better known, medical uses would be found for it,
perhaps in the treatment of alcoholism, narcotic addiction,
mental disorders, and terminal diseases associated with severe
pain. Several years later a team of researchers working in
Baltimore independently tested the validity of her unusual
vision. A group of psychiatrists and psychologists at the
Maryland Psychiatric Research Center who were not familiar with
the article in <i>This Week</i> conducted systematic studies of
psychedelic therapy with LSD, a drug closely related to
psilocybin, for exactly the same indications that Valentina
Wasson predicted. We ourselves were surprised to discover the
newspaper clipping in Gordon Wasson's library during a 1974 visit
to his home. </p>

<p>The next stimulus for the use of psychedelics with dying
individuals did not come from a physician or behavioral scientist
but from the writer and philosopher, Aldous Huxley. He was
profoundly interested both in the phenomenon of dying and in the
religious and mystical experiences induced by psychedelic drugs.
With unusual sensitivity and insight he assisted his first wife,
Maria, when in 1955 she was dying of cancer. During her final
hours he used a hypnotic technique to bring her into touch with
the memory of ecstatic experiences that had occurred
spontaneously on several occasions during her life. The explicit
goal was to facilitate her experience of dying by guiding her
toward these mystical states of consciousness as death was
approaching. This deep personal experience has its parallel in
Huxley's novel <i>Island</i>, where the character Lakshmi is
dying under very similar circumstances. In a letter to Humphry
Osmond, a psychiatrist and pioneer in psychedelic research who
introduced him to LSD and mescaline, Huxley wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>My own experience with Maria convinced me that the living
    can do a great deal to make the passage easier for the dying,
    to raise the most purely physiological act of human existence
    to the level of consciousness and perhaps even of
    spirituality. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To those who are familiar with the effects of hallucinogenic
drugs and with Huxley's personal history, there is no doubt that
the &quot;soma&quot; in <i>Brave New World</i> and the ''moksha
medicine'' in <i>Island</i> are psychedelic substances similar in
their effects to LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin. In Huxley's
vision &quot;moksha medicine'' gives inhabitants of the island
mystical insights that free them from the fear of death and
enable them to live more fully. In another letter to Humphry
Osmond written as early as February 1958, Huxley was quite
explicit about his idea of seriously considering the use of LSD
with dying individuals: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . yet another project--the administration of LSD to
    terminal cancer cases, in the hope that it would make dying
    more spiritual, less strictly physiological process. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to his second wife, Laura, Aldous mentioned on
several occasions that ''the last rites should make one more
conscious rather than less conscious, more human rather than less
human.'' In 1963, when he was himself dying of cancer, Huxley
demonstrated the seriousness of his vision. Several hours before
his death he asked Laura to give him 100 micrograms of LSD to
facilitate his own dying. This moving experience was later
described in Laura Huxley's book, <i>This Timeless Moment</i>. </p>

<p>Aldous Huxley's suggestion, although reinforced by his unique
personal example, for several years had no influence on medical
researchers. The next contribution to this area came from a
rather unexpected source and was unrelated to Huxley's thinking
and efforts. In the early 1960s Eric Kast of the Chicago Medical
School studied the effects of various drugs on the experience of
pain in the quest for a good and reliable analgesic. He became
interested in LSD as a possible candidate for such a substance
because of certain peculiarities of its effect on humans. He
learned that LSD tends to produce a marked distortion of the body
image and alterations of body boundaries; furthermore, it seemed
to interfere with the ability to concentrate and maintain
selective attention on a particular physiological sensation.
Thus, in individuals who are under the influence of LSD, simple
visual impressions may take precedence over sensations of pain or
concerns related to survival. Both the effect of LSD on the body
image and its interference with selective focus on significant
input seemed to be worth exploring in terms of their potential
for altering the perception of physical pain. </p>

<p>In a paper published in 1964 Kast and Collins described the
results of a study in which the hypothetical analgesic properties
of LSD were compared to those of two established and potent
drugs, dihydromorphinone (Dilaudid) and meperidine (Demerol). In
a group of fifty individuals suffering from severe physical pain
were thirty-nine patients with various types and stages of
cancer, ten patients with gangrenes of feet or legs, and one with
severe herpes zoster (shingles). The outcome of the statistical
analysis of this comparison indicated that the analgesic effect
of LSD proved to be superior to both Dilaudid and Demerol. In
addition to pain relief, Kast and Collins noticed that some of
these individuals showed a striking disregard for the gravity of
their personal situations. They frequently talked about their
impending death with an emotional attitude that would be
considered atypical in our culture; yet it was quite obvious that
this new perspective was beneficial in view of the situation they
were facing. </p>

<p>In a later study of 128 individuals with metastatic cancer,
Kast explored in more detail some of his earlier findings. This
time he was interested not only in the effects of LSD on pain but
also on some additional parameters: emotional changes, sleep
patterns, and attitudes toward illness and death. In view of the
fact that there was no psycho therapeutic emphasis and the
patients were not even informed that they were being given LSD,
the results were quite remarkable. A precipitous drop in pain
occurred in many individuals about two to three hours after the
administration of 100 micrograms of LSD and lasted an average of
twelve hours; pain intensity for the whole group (not necessarily
for every patient) was decreased for a period of three weeks. For
about ten days after the session, Kast observed improvement of
sleep and a less concerned attitude toward illness and death. </p>

<p>In 1966 Kast published another paper in which he paid more
explicit attention to the influence of LSD on the religious and
philosophical experiences and ideas of the patients. The group he
studied consisted of eighty persons suffering from terminal
malignant disease, with estimated life expectancies of weeks or
months, each of whom had been fully informed of the diagnosis. In
contrast to earlier studies, the LSD sessions were terminated by
an intramuscular injection of 100 milligrams of chlorpromazine
upon the appearance of fear, panic, unpleasant imagery, or the
desire to rest. The beneficial influence of a single
administration of 100 micrograms of LSD on physical pain, mood,
and sleep patterns was similar to the preceding studies. In
addition, Kast described a variety of changes in the patients
that made their situation more tolerable. He noticed improved
communication both between the observer and the patients and
among the patients themselves; this enhanced their morale and
self-respect and created a sense of cohesion and community among
them. Quite significant, also, was the occurrence of &quot;happy,
oceanic feelings&quot; lasting up to twelve days following the
administration of LSD. Kast stated explicitly that a certain
change in philosophical and religious attitudes in relationship
to dying took place that were not reflected in his numerical data
and graphs. </p>

<p>In spite of what to an LSD therapist might at present appear
as shortcomings in Kast's studies, the historical value of his
pioneering effort is unquestionable. He not only discovered the
analgesic value of LSD for some patients with intractable pain,
but he also brought forth the first experimental evidence for
Aldous Huxley's suggestion that the administration of LSD might
ease the encounter with death in persons suffering from cancer.
Kast concluded the last of his studies by stating that, according
to his observations, LSD is capable not only of improving the lot
of dying individuals by making them more responsive to their
environment and family, but it also enhances their ability to
appreciate the nuances and subtleties of everyday life. It gives
them aesthetic satisfaction and &quot;creates a new will to live
and a zest for experience, which, against a background of dismal
darkness and preoccupying fear, produces an exciting and
promising outlook.&quot; </p>

<p>The encouraging results of Kast's studies inspired Sidney
Cohen, a prominent Los Angeles psychiatrist, friend of Aldous
Huxley, and one of the pioneers in LSD research, to start a
program of psychedelic therapy for individuals dying of cancer.
Unfortunately the results of his study and the details of his
treatment procedure have never been published. In a 1965 article
Cohen expressed his feelings about the potential of psychedelic
therapy for the dying, based on his pilot experiments with a
small group of patients. He stated that his own work confirmed
Kast's findings about the beneficial effect of LSD on severe
physical pain and suggested that LSD may one day provide a
technique for altering the experience of dying. Cohen saw clearly
the importance of this research endeavor: &quot;Death must become
a more human experience. To preserve the dignity of death and
prevent the living from abandoning or distancing themselves from
the dying is one of the great dilemmas of modern medicine.&quot; </p>

<p>Cohen's co-worker, Gary Fisher, later published a paper in
which he discussed the personal and interpersonal problems of the
dying. In this context he emphasized the significance of
transcendental experiences--whether spontaneous, resulting from
various spiritual practices, or induced by psychedelic drugs. As
a result of such experiences the individual ceases to be
concerned about his or her own physical demise and begins to see
it as a natural phenomenon of the cycling of the life force. This
acceptance drastically alters a person's life-style; the
individual no longer reacts with panic, fear, pain, and
dependency to the changes that are occurring. Rather, the patient
is willing and eager to share this new knowledge with close
family members and friends. Fisher discussed the use of LSD
therapy within the framework of a research project where this
drug was compared with an experimental analgesic and only one
hour was allowed for preparing patients for the session. In spite
of this limitation, he observed what he described as dramatic
results in terms of pain reduction, psychological aftereffects,
and adjustment of the patients to their impending deaths. </p>

<p>Another series of observations that was later integrated into
the concept of psychedelic therapy for the dying originated in
the Psychiatric Research Institute in Prague, Czechoslovakia. A
research team of this institute headed by Stanislav Grof
(coauthor of this book) conducted experiments in the early 1960s
with psychiatric patients, exploring the potential of LSD for
personality diagnostics and psychotherapy. These efforts finally
resulted in treatment that involved intense psychological work
and a series of therapeutic sessions with LSD. Although this
approach was initially based in theory and practice on
psychoanalysis, in the course of years it underwent substantial
modifications and became an independent therapeutic procedure
combining work on psychodynamic issues with a definite emphasis
on transpersonal and transcendental experiences. </p>

<p>In the exploratory phase of this work, all psychiatric
patients from various diagnostic categories undergoing serial LSD
sessions sooner or later transcended the psychoanalytic framework
and spontaneously moved into experiential realms that have been
described through millennia as occurring in various schools of
the mystical tradition, temple mysteries, and rites of passage in
many ancient and pretechnological cultures of the world. The most
common as well as the most important of these phenomena were
experiences of death and rebirth, followed by feelings of cosmic
unity. This profound encounter with one's own impermanence and
mortality was very complex and had biological, emotional,
intellectual, philosophical, and metaphysical dimensions.
Experiences of this kind seemed to have had very beneficial
consequences for these psychiatric patients; some very dramatic
improvements of various psychopathological conditions were
observed immediately following the death-rebirth phenomenon and,
in particular, the experiences of oneness with the universe. This
suggested the existence of a powerful therapeutic mechanism as
yet unknown to Western psychiatry and psychology that appeared
far superior to those used in conventional psychotherapy. </p>

<p>Many individuals who had the experience of death and rebirth
sometimes accompanied by feelings of cosmic unity independently
reported that their attitudes toward dying and their concepts of
death underwent dramatic changes. Fear of their own physiological
demise diminished, they became open to the possibility of
consciousness existing after clinical death, and tended to view
the process of dying as an adventure in consciousness rather than
the ultimate biological disaster. Those of us conducting this
research kept witnessing, to our great surprise, a process that
bore a striking similarity to mystical initiation and involved
experiential sequences that resembled those described in the <i>Tibetan</i>
or <i>Egyptian Book of the Dead</i>. </p>

<p>The claims of changes in attitudes toward death were so
frequent that it seemed important to test their practical
relevance. It was obvious that a deep change of consciousness of
that sort could be very beneficial for dying individuals,
particularly those with chronic, incurable diseases. The first
author (S.G.) then had an opportunity to work with several
persons diagnosed with cancer. These pilot observations indicated
that the alleviation of the fear of death earlier reported as a
result of LSD therapy in psychiatric patients (most of whom were
young and physically healthy) can occur also in those for whom
the issue of death is of immediate relevance. At this point the
Prague group began seriously discussing the possibility of
working systematically with dying people, and Grof designed a
research program using serial LSD sessions with individuals dying
of cancer. These plans were interrupted by a fellowship granted
to him by the Foundation's Fund for Research in Psychiatry in New
Haven, Connecticut, that took him to the United States. </p>

<p>After his arrival in Baltimore in March 1967, he joined the
team in the Research Unit of Spring Grove State Hospital, which
later became the core of the Clinical Sciences Department of the
newly built Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. Here he found,
to his surprise, that some time prior to his arrival this group
had been interested in exploring the potential of LSD
psychotherapy for alleviating the emotional and physical
suffering of cancer patients. The sequence of events that spurred
the interest of the research team in this problem area, briefly
described, is this: Since 1963 a group of psychiatrists,
psychologists, and social workers at Spring Grove had been
exploring the effects of a brief course of LSD-assisted
psychotherapy on the drinking behavior, psychological condition,
and social adjustment of alcoholics. In a parallel study the
therapeutic potential of this new treatment was tested in a group
of neurotic patients. During the assessment, based on clinical
interviews as well as psychological testing, the symptoms
particularly responsive to psychedelic therapy appeared to be
depression and anxiety. </p>

<p>In 1965, when the studies with alcoholics and neurotics were
well under way, the Spring Grove research team first focused its
attention on the needs of dying cancer patients in an unforeseen
and tragic manner. A professional member of the research team,
Gloria, a woman in her early forties, developed a carcinoma of
the breast. She had undergone a radical mastectomy; subsequent
surgery had revealed inoperable metastases of the liver. Although
still ambulatory, she was in severe physical and emotional
distress. She was fully aware of her condition and her prognosis
and shared her feelings of despair with staff members. On the
basis of the relief of depression and anxiety frequently observed
in psychiatric patients following LSD-assisted psychotherapy,
Sidney Wolf, a psychologist and member of the therapeutic team,
suggested that the psychedelic treatment procedure might prove
helpful to his colleague. It seemed possible that her depression
and anxiety, although reactive in nature and well substantiated
by a painful life situation, might respond favorably to LSD
therapy, as was the case in other conditions of a psychogenic
nature. </p>

<p>After discussions with her husband, her physician, and with
the approval of all concerned, a course of psychedelic therapy
was initiated, with Sidney Wolf in the role of &quot;sitter.'' In
the treatment plan at Spring Grove the primary objective was to
facilitate the occurrence of a psychedelic peak experience in the
context of brief but intensive psychotherapy. The preparation for
the session lasted somewhat over a week; the focus was on the
issue of personal identity and on current interpersonal
relationships. When most of the important areas involved were
satisfactorily clarified, a 200-microgram LSD session was
conducted under conditions quite similar to those used for
psychiatric patients. The outcome of this pioneering experiment
was quite remarkable: After careful preparation and several
subsequent drug-free interviews a single LSD experience seemed to
have changed the quality of Gloria's remaining days. Shortly
after the LSD session she went on vacation with her husband and
children. Upon her return, two weeks after the session, she
completed the following retrospective report: </p>

<p>''The day prior to LSD, I was fearful and anxious. I would at
that point have gratefully withdrawn. By the end of the
preparatory session practically all anxiety was gone; the
instructions were understood and the procedure clear. The night
was spent quietly at home; close friends visited and we looked at
photograph albums and remembered happy family times. Sleep was
deep and peaceful. I awakened refreshed, and with practically no
fear. I felt ready and eager. The morning was lovely, cool and
with a freshness in the air. I arrived at the LSD building with
the therapist. Members of the department were around to wish me
well. It was a good feeling. </p>

<p>''In the treatment room was a beautiful happiness rosebud,
deep red and dewy, but disappointingly not as fragrant as other
varieties. A bowl of fruit, moist, succulent, also reposed on the
table. I was immediately given the first dose and sat looking at
pictures from my family album. Gradually, my movements became
fuzzy and I felt awkward. I was made to recline with earphones
and eyeshades. At some point the second LSD dose was given to me.
This phase was generally associated with impatience. I had been
given instructions lest there be pain, fear, or other
difficulties. I was ready to try out my ability to face the
unknown ahead of me and to triumph over my obstacles. I was
ready, but except for the physical sensations of awkwardness and
some drowsiness nothing was happening. </p>

<p>''At about this time, it seems, I fused with the music and was
transported on it. So completely was I one with the sound that
when the particular melody or record stopped, however
momentarily, I was alive to the pause, eagerly awaiting the next
lap of the journey. A delightful game was being played. What was
coming next? Would it be powerful, tender, dancing, or somber? I
felt at these times as though I were being teased, but so nicely,
so gently. I wanted to laugh in sheer appreciation of these
responses, regardless of where I had just been, how sad or awed.
And as soon as the music began, I was off again. Nor do I
remember all the explorations. </p>

<p>&quot;Mainly I remember two experiences. I was alone in a
timeless world with no boundaries. There was no atmosphere; there
was no color, no imagery, but there may have been light. Suddenly
I recognized that I was a moment in time, created by those before
me and in turn the creator of others. This was my moment, and my
major function had been completed. By being born, I had given
meaning to my parents' existence. </p>

<p>&quot;Again in the void, alone without the time-space
boundaries. Life reduced itself over and over again to the least
common denominator. I cannot remember the logic of the
experience, but I became poignantly aware that the core of life
is love. At this moment I felt that I was reaching out to the
world--to all people--but especially to those closest to me. I
wept long for the wasted years, the search for identity in false
places, the neglected opportunities, the emotional energy lost in
basically meaningless pursuits. </p>

<p>&quot;Many times, after respites, I went back, but always to
variations on the same themes. The music carried and sustained
me. Occasionally, during rests, I was aware of the smell of
peaches. The rose was nothing to the fruit. The fruit was nectar
and ambrosia (life); the rose was only a beautiful flower. When I
finally was given a nectarine it was the epitome of subtle,
succulent flavor. </p>

<p>&quot;As I began to emerge, I was taken to a fresh windswept
world. Members of the department welcomed me and I felt not only
joy for myself, but for having been able to use the experience
these people who cared for me wanted me to have. I felt very
close to a large group of people. Later, as members of my family
came, there was a closeness that seemed new. That night, at home,
my parents came, too. All noticed a change in me. I was radiant,
and I seemed at peace, they said. I felt that way too. What has
changed for me? I am living now, and being. I can take it as it
comes. Some of my physical symptoms are gone. The excessive
fatigue, some of the pains. I still get irritated occasionally
and yell. I am still me, but more at peace. My family senses this
and we are closer. All who know me well say that this has been a
good experience.&quot; </p>

<p>Five weeks after the date of the session, Gloria suddenly
developed ascites (accumulation of serous fluid in the abdominal
cavity) and had to be rehospitalized; she died quietly three days
later. </p>

<p>The result of Sidney Wolf's endeavor was so encouraging that
the Spring Grove staff decided to explore further the potential
of psychedelic therapy for alleviating the suffering of those
dying of cancer. A group of open-minded surgeons at Baltimore's
Sinai Hospital expressed interest in this procedure, offered
their cooperation, and agreed to refer patients for LSD therapy.
Three more persons were treated at this time by Sanford Unger, a
psychologist who had played an important role in launching the
Spring Grove studies of alcoholics and neurotics. </p>

<p>The next important step in this direction was made in late
1967, when Walter N. Pahnke joined the Spring Grove team. He was
instrumental in changing the initial interest of the staff into a
systematic pilot exploration and eventually a research project.
Pahnke's background made him ideally suited for this type of
work. He was a graduate of Harvard Medical School, and in
addition had a doctoral degree in comparative religion and a
degree in divinity. </p>

<p>It is hard to imagine a more useful way to combine medicine,
psychology, and religion than psychedelic therapy with dying
individuals. With unusual energy, enthusiasm, and devotion,
Pahnke assumed the role of principal investigator in the cancer
study. After pilot experimentation he was able to obtain
financial support from the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation. He
started a research program exploring the value of psychedelic
therapy utilizing LSD. Later he initiated a similar project in
which a short-acting psychedelic, dipropyltryptamine (DPT), was
used in lieu of LSD. </p>

<p>Walter Pahnke's life and work were drastically terminated in a
tragic accident on July 10, 1971. While vacationing in his summer
cabin in Maine, he did not return from one of his scuba-diving
expeditions. His body and diving equipment were never recovered
and the nature of the accident has remained a mystery. Walter's
demise was a great loss for the Spring Grove team, from the
personal as well as professional point of view. After Walter's
death the first author (S.G.) assumed medical responsibility for
the cancer study as his primary research activity and interest.
His objective was not only to complete the research projects and
accumulate enough data but also to formulate a theoretical
framework that would account for some of the dramatic changes
occurring as a result of LSD therapy. It seemed important at this
point to carefully analyze the data from LSD sessions of normal
volunteers, psychiatric patients, and dying individuals, and to
formulate a comprehensive theory of LSD therapy based on a new
model of the unconscious. </p>

<p>A new dimension was added to these endeavors when in 1972,
Joan Halifax, the second author, joined the team as co-therapist
and anthropological consultant. We could now combine our
backgrounds in experimental psychiatry and medical anthropology
and view the data from a broad cross-cultural perspective. It was
in this process of interdisciplinary cross-fertilization, when we
were working as a therapeutic dyad, sharing observations and
exchanging data, that the ideas expressed in this book started to
crystallize into their present form. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Although the Spring Grove psychedelic research continued
    on until the mid-1970's, it, too, finally came to an end for
    various reasons. Lack of new funding by the government,
    discouragement of the workers involved in not obtaining
    permission to carry out desired projects, continuing bad
    publicity resulting from clandestine use of psychedelics, and
    other factors could be cited. And so, by the late 1970's
    essentially all psychedelic research in North America had
    ceased, and what remained of European research was a mere
    ghost of the promising work of the 1950's and 1960's. </p>

<hr>

<p>On the 16th of January, 1960, a day-long symposium on lysergic
acid diethylamide was held at the Napa State Hospital, Imola,
California. The symposium attracted considerable regional
attention and was later broadcast over KPFA, an educational FM
station. Because of its length it has been impossible to publish
it in its entirety. As a joint contribution of the Mental
Research Institute, Palo Alto, JNMD herewith presents papers
given at the symposium by three members of that Institute, Dr.
Charles Savage, Dr. James Terrill and Dr. Donald D. Jackson. The
manuscripts have been edited by Dr. Savage and where possible
have been brought up to date with footnotes. An effort has been
made to capture the original spirit of the symposium, which was
characterized by a turning away from the conventional view of LSD
as a mere facilitator of therapy toward the view of it as a new
experience, a new beginning. </p>

<h3>The Nature of the LSD Experience</h3>

<h4>JAMES TERRILL, PH.D.<sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup></h4>
</center>

<hr>
<a name="back3"></a>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What is the nature of the LSD experience? There is
no simple answer to this question. Early in our work with LSD at
the Mental Research Institute it became clear that there are no
regular and predictable effects of LSD per se, but rather that
the effects are the result of a complex interaction<sup><a
href="#foot4">4</a></sup><a name="back4"></a> of the drug, the
psychological and physical environment, the personality structure
of the subject and therapist, and the set or expectancy as to
what the drug would do. Judging from the literature on LSD, this
point about the relativity of LSD effects has not been
sufficiently emphasized (2). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our conclusions regarding the psychological effects
of LSD have developed out of a series of exploratory studies that
were carried out at the Mental Research Institute over a two-year
period (1958-59). Ss have included 60 volunteers and 29
psychiatric patients. Most of the volunteers Ss were professional
people (psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers) who took
the drug, ostensibly, out of curiosity. The psychiatric patients
were, for the most part, already in regular psychotherapy and
were taking the drug as a part of their treatment. Many of our Ss
have had more than one LSD experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During some of the early work at the Institute
several ways of approaching the subject in the LSD state were
tried, including the administration of psychological tests and
the utilization of various interview techniques. Experiments in
this regard led to the conclusion that any attempt on the
experimenter's part to impose a structured test or interview on
the situation had the effect of radically altering the subjective
experience of S. The most significant effects of the drug seemed
to occur when S was allowed to follow his own spontaneous train
of thought. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The technique of administration used with most of
Ss, therefore, is based on an attempt to provide a relatively
permissive, comfortable and accepting atmosphere. Ss were
encouraged to give themselves up to the effects of the drug as
much as possible. All the drug sessions were conducted in a
small, sound-proofed room that was very comfortably furnished
with a couch, carpet, pictures on the wall, and a stereo record
player. Ss were usually provided with an opportunity to listen to
music or look at visual stimuli An attempt was made to reduce the
amount of stress to a minimum. Someone was with S during most of
the day. He therefore had the opportunity to talk with someone if
he wished, although it was made clear to each S that he need not
talk if he did not feel like it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The dosages used have ranged from 50 to 200
micrograms, with the most frequent dosage being 100 micrograms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Volunteer Ss and patients were treated in much the
same manner, except that the patients entered the sessions with a
very different set. The LSD sessions were presented to each
patient as an adjunct to his regular treatment, and his therapist
was usually present during a part of the time. The role
relationship between the experimenters and the patients was
naturally quite different from the role relationship between the
experimenters and the professional volunteer Ss. When a
professional volunteer takes LSD in the presence of a colleague
he is frequently thrown into considerable conflict as to what his
role should be. This often presents a rather difficult situation
for the person who is administering the drug as well. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In describing the effects that we have observed
under these conditions and with these Ss, it is important to
distinguish between two classes of effects. One class is the
immediate effects, i.e., those which occur within eight to twelve
hours after ingestion of the drug. The other class consists of
the more lasting effects, i.e., those which persist for an
indeterminate period after the immediate effects have dissipated.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In studying the immediate effects, the approach has
been to observe the subject's relatively spontaneous behavior
while he is under the influence of the drug and also to analyze
the tape recordings made of each drug session.</p>

<p> </p>

<h4>Effects</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The immediate effects which have been observed
can roughly be classified into five categories: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Mood and affect; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Interpersonal behavior; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3) Sensory and perceptual effects; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 4) Intellectual functioning and reality testing; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 5) Intuitive-intellectual effects. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In terms of <i>mood and affect,</i> Ss have
demonstrated a wide range of reactions. Often an emotional
lability is seen which ranges from tearfulness to euphoria. There
is frequently an increased intensity to emotions in general.
Feelings of well-being or euphoria, which many subjects have
reported, tend to merge into feelings of omnipotence. Sometimes
there appears to be an increase in anxiety; while at other times
anxiety is decreased, and there is a feeling that previously
threatening things can be talked about. Ss tend to show an
increased concern with the feelings and events of the immediate
moment, and sometimes there is a marked lack of concern about the
past and future. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In terms of <i>interpersonal behavior</i>, Ss
typically have manifested an increased sensitivity to their
interactions with others. In many Ss this sensitivity has taken
the form of being easily hurt or feeling neglected. With the
majority of Ss there has been an enhancement of the relationship
with the person who is conducting the experience. Sometimes
patients have developed paranoid constructions about being
manipulated. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The following varieties of <i>sensory and
perceptual effects</i> have been relatively common with our Ss:
there is an increased sensitivity to sounds and visual stimuli in
general. Distortions of the body image (visual distortions which
are usually illusory but sometimes hallucinatory) also occur.
There are synesthesias with all sorts of combinations of
sensations; e.g., music may produce visions of color, pictures
may produce sounds, and odors may produce visual and auditory
images or somatic sensations. There are transformations of the
time sense, such as time standing still, racing backwards or
forwards, or dragging interminably. The external world becomes
unstable, receding and approaching, flowing and vibrating. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the area of <i>intellectual functioning and
reality testing</i>, LSD usually has resulted in a lability of
thought processes which frequently has manifested itself as a
flight of ideas. There often has been a marked disruption of the
organization of thoughts and concepts. In attempting to deal with
this disorganization, S has often come up with new, sometimes
insightful, ways of conceptualizing his experiences. Unless the
LSD therapist is equally at home with both old and new ideas he
may overlook creative aspects of the patient's thinking and label
it all as merely confused or psychotic. The therapist's confusion
may in turn confuse the patient. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is still a fifth class of effects which could
be termed <i>intuitive-intellectual</i> effects. Included in this
category are experiences such as a feeling of oneness, a feeling
of &quot;understanding&quot; life and existence, religious
experiences, transcendental experiences, or a strong inclination
to think along philosophical lines. Such experiences have been
reported relatively frequently and appear to be a combination of
both emotional and intellectual functions. Patients who have had
vivid experiences of this type have tended to value them highly
and often have expressed the feeling that such experiences seem
to have some sort of lasting beneficial effect. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This list of immediate effects covers a wide range,
and frequently S in a single drug session will experience a large
number of them. It should be noted that many of the effects
mentioned are contradictory. In this connection it has been
observed that S will often shift from one experience or emotion
to its opposite in a very short time.</p>

<p> </p>

<h4>Response Variation</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Individuals differed greatly in their responses
to LSD. At a given dosage some Ss reported that they experienced
little or nothing out of the ordinary, while others reported
extremely intense and unusual experiences. Of those who did
report significant effects, some experienced predominantly
unpleasant effects, while others felt the experience was
primarily pleasant; some were principally concerned with changes
in the body image, while others became preoccupied with esthetic
experiences on philosophical issues. It was also noted that the
same individual might show considerable variation in his response
to LSD from one session to the next. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In general we have felt that the more positive
kinds of experiences have something to do with S's willingness or
ability to give himself up to the effects of the drug. If S is
very concerned about maintaining control or fighting the effects
of the drug, the experiences can be frightening, sometimes
terrifying.<sup><a href="#foot5">5</a></sup><a name="back5"></a>
By and large, however, we have observed very few reactions that
could be termed blatantly psychotic. It would probably be fairly
easy to induce more psychotic-like behavior if Ss were put into a
more stressful situation and made to feel more insecure.<sup><a
href="#foot6">6</a></sup><a name="back6"></a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In studying the effectiveness of LSD as a
therapeutic adjunct, attention has been focused on what kinds of
possible <i>lasting</i> effects might occur as a result of one or
more LSD experiences. Often the more lasting effects seem
difficult for the patient to describe. A study of Ss' reports
along with observations of their behavior suggests that the
following kinds of changes occur as a result of a series of
therapeutically oriented LSD sessions: S becomes less anxious,
less rigid, more spontaneous, more tolerant of ambiguity, more
appreciative of esthetic and symbolic modes of expression, more
capable of enjoying intuitive, irrational experiences, and less
concerned over the past and future. Whether these changes are of
a universal order remains a question for further investigation.
It is conceivable that they are a function of the particular
sample of Ss, many of whom tended toward emotional constriction,
intellectualization and ruminative thinking. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to these general kinds of changes,
there are specific changes that have to do with the individual's
dynamics. Often S may gain a new perspective on himself or gain
an important insight into his defenses which results in a change
in behavior. Sometimes, however, what the patient calls
&quot;insight&quot; turns out to be an irrational, ineffable and
peculiar experience that seemed to have a very important personal
meaning to S. As an example of this, a man felt during his
initial LSD experience that his joints were somehow grinding
together. He felt that all of the rough edges in his joints were
ground smooth, and this gave him a &quot;well oiled&quot; feeling
which seemed to persist for weeks afterwards. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the most intriguing aspects of the use of
LSD as in psychotherapy is that when positive changes have
occurred they often seem to have occurred in terms of the <i>person's
value system</i> rather than in terms of recovered memories,
interpersonal insights and the like, as is usually the case with
more traditional forms of psychotherapy. Such changes are
apparently in the direction of a higher valuation of esthetic,
creative, philosophic and perhaps even religious interests. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It should be pointed out that although the use of
LSD in therapy often results in changes that one would not get
otherwise, this does not obviate the need for regular
psychotherapeutic procedures. Although the patient may make
significant gains as a result of an LSD experience, we have
concluded that the experience needs to be followed up with
regular therapeutic sessions in order to work through the
insights that have been gained and the behavioral changes that
have been initiated. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How effective is LSD as a psychotherapeutic agent?
Ratings of improvement based on therapists' judgments and in some
cases pre- and post-LSD psychological tests indicate that 15 of
the 29 patients who received one or more LSD sessions benefited
therefrom. This evidence is far from conclusive, however, since
these patients were receiving regular therapy at the same time
and since no control group was utilized. Plans had been made at
the Mental Research Institute to undertake a more complete and
well controlled study of the therapeutic effectiveness of LSD,
but unfortunately we have not yet been able to obtain sufficient
financial support to carry these out. Although much has been
written on LSD as a therapeutic adjunct, there is still a dearth
of well controlled studies with adequate measures of change. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Comparable data are not available on our
professional volunteers. We were primarily interested in learning
from these Ss their theoretical interpretation of their
experiences and their judgment as to how LSD might best be
utilized. We found it difficult to obtain post-LSD reports from
these Ss, and their reports when obtained were oriented more
toward the personal experience rather than to theoretical
interpretation. Even though these sessions were not
therapeutically oriented (though conducted in a therapeutic
setting) many professional Ss reported increased feelings of
well-being and confidence. For example, one volunteer had the
annoying habit of being late and consuming even more time with
apologies. Since the LSD experience she has been observed to be
less often tardy---and if late she is less guilt ridden and
apologetic. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our work with LSD so far has perhaps raised more
questions than it has answered. One of the most important of
these is the question of the relationship between personality
factors and response to LSD. Our attempts to predict the kind of
LSD response a person would have, based on pre-LSD test and
interview data, have been discouraging. For example, three
patients had Holzman, TAT, and historical evidence from which the
only possible prediction was a psychotic break under LSD. On the
contrary, they seemed to have richly rewarding experiences.<a
href="#foot7"><sup>7</sup></a><a name="back7"></a> It seems clear
that LSD can provide very therapeutic experiences for some,
although more research is needed to determine what kind of person
is most likely to benefit. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another unanswered question is the relationship
between the nature of the experience and its aftereffects. Many
workers have assumed that positive experiences are most helpful
and that transcendental experiences have the greatest therapeutic
potential. And yet there are instances where frightening or
terrifying experiences have had beneficial aftereffects. Several
of our professional Ss have remarked that they believed that much
of the beneficial effect of LSD was due to a person's having
faced a stressful and ambiguous situation and worked it through
satisfactorily.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Exploratory LSD studies carried out at the
Mental Research Institute over a two-year period have suggested
that LSD may prove to be a very powerful tool in speeding up
movement and overcoming resistances in psychotherapy. LSD did
not, on the other hand, show promise as a diagnostic tool. When
therapeutic changes did occur they often were of a qualitatively
different order than those which occur in traditional
psychotherapy. Under the influence of LSD, the individual goes
through highly intense and unusual experiences which may well
change the way in which he views his life.</p>

made possible by USPHS Grant MY2621. <a href="#back3">(back)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot4"></a>4. I prefer the word
&quot;transaction&quot; introduced by Cantril (6). Implicit in
this concept is the necessity to structure the environment
according to what one wishes to get out of it (22). The
patterning of the milieu described hereafter derives from the
Hollywood Hospital group, though the symposium antedates their
publication (17). Ed. <a href="#back4">(back)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot5"></a>5. Beringer (4) noted the same
thing for mescaline in 1927. <a href="#back5">(back)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot6"></a>6. Dr. Terrill's conjecture was
soon thereafter confirmed. An associate put himself in an extreme
stress situation by privately consuming 200 micrograms of LSD
which he had stolen. It took him two years for a full recovery. <a
href="#back6">(back)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot7"></a>7. A three-year follow-up on
this trio is instructive. Dr. P.S. made a dramatic improvement
following LSD, but two years of family therapy were required to
sustain it. His pre-LSD Holzman shows many torn, syphilitic,
bleeding genitals and ani. The post-LSD Holzman is more typified
by nymphs dancing with satyrs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs. B.L.S. could not tolerate sexual relations
with her husband. He had had a vasectomy and she thought him
abnormal. Following LSD their sex life became satisfactory until
he suggested anal intercourse; this suggestion restored her
frigidity which has since remained inviolate. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. I.M. suffered from a three-year spell of
impotence, but after LSD was able to have normal sexual relations
twice in an evening. His wife cooperated fully. The next morning
she upbraided him bitterly for having raped her while drunk.
Three years of therapy were required to restore his potency. <a

<h3>LSD, Alcoholism and Transcendence</h3>

<h4>CHARLES SAVAGE, M.D.</h4>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Visit either you like: they're both
mad.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;But I don't want to go among mad
people,&quot; Alice remarked. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're
mad.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;How do you know I'm mad?&quot; said Alice. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;You must be,&quot; said the Cat, &quot;or you
wouldn't have come here.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> The Cat recognized what was not apparent to his Victorian
contemporaries. We are all part of a sick society, troubled
members of a troubled world. Inevitably many people look to drink
for salvation. For some it is an imperfect salvation, leading to
the couch, the hospital or the grave. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our plight is not unlike that of the
nineteenth-century American Indian. His land was stolen, his
livelihood lost, his life forfeit, his language, customs and
beliefs were all deliberately undermined by the white man in the
name of Christ, Culture and Civilization. Confronted with
physical and spiritual annihilation, the &quot;red man&quot;
faced the future with grim foreboding. Many Indians turned to
drink; but others turned to peyote, the Aztec counterpart of LSD.
Seemingly they turned to peyote for inner strength. &quot;Peyote
gave them faith in a new power and a new road that they might
follow from the path that was still in their hearts and mind to a
feared and little understood future. The meeting of compelling
forces, conscious and unconscious, of racial memories, the loss
of tribal security and religious beliefs, added to the drive of
the creative urge to make live in form and color the spirit of
the Indian&quot; (26).<a name="back8"></a><a href="#foot8"><sup>8</sup></a>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Slotkin (24) has reported that peyote has
remarkable physiological and psychological characteristics so
that when taken under proper conditions, the worshiper
experiences a revelation. In most cases this takes the form of a
vision. In some cases, it is a mystical state, the unification of
all immediate experience with &quot;God.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The connection of peyote and LSD is not only in
their psychophysiological properties; it happens also that both
have been and are used in the treatment of alcoholism. As early
as 1907 anthropologists (24) had reported that peyote was a cure
for alcoholism; and in 1909 it was reported of the Winnebagos
that of the degenerate drunks of thirty years ago (1879), those
who had turned to peyote had now become the most successful,
healthy and outstanding members of the Winnebago community.<a
name="back9"></a><a href="#foot9"><sup>9</sup></a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Today (1960) recovery rates as high as 70 percent
are being reported with the LSD therapy of alcoholics.<a
name="back10"></a><a href="#foot10"><sup>10</sup></a> Rather than
attempt a critical evaluation of these claims, I propose to deal
here with the question: How may LSD be of help to the alcoholic? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Long ago William James (14) made the comment:
&quot;The cure for dipsomania is religomania.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; James quoted the following example from a drunkard,
S. H. Hadley: &quot;One Tuesday evening, I sat in a saloon in
Harlem, a homeless, friendless dying drunkard. I had pawned and
sold everything that would bring a drink. I could not sleep
unless I was dead drunk. I had not eaten for days, and for four
nights preceding I had suffered with delirium tremens or the
horrors from midnight until morning. I often said, 'I will never
be a tramp. I will find a home in the bottom of the river.' But
the Lord so ordered it that when the time did come, I was not
able to walk one quarter of the way to the river. As I sat there
thinking, I seemed to feel some great and mighty presence. I did
not know then what it was. I did learn afterwards that it was
Jesus, the sinners' friend. I walked up to the bar and pounded it
with my fist 'til I made the glasses rattle. Those who stood by
drinking looked on with scornful curiosity. I said I would never
take another drink if I died in the street.&quot; And so complete
was Hadley's conversion that he never did take another drink. As
an example of a conversion reaction with LSD followed by
abstinence: An alcoholic woman was given 150 micrograms of LSD;
during her session she fell silent. She closed her eyes and
seemed to fall into a trance. She woke with a start, and said:
&quot;I thought I had been killed. I thought I was tried, dragged
in chains before God, condemned and taken out to be
executed.&quot; She awoke feeling that she had been reprieved,
that she had been saved.<a name="back11"></a><a href="#foot11"><sup>11</sup></a>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another patient had had doses of 100 to 200
micrograms of LSD without noticeable benefit. She laughed and
danced and listened to jazz records. She once described that she
had talked with the devil and had thrown in her lot with him. So
she went the devil's way, increasing her drinking and taking
&quot;dope.&quot; Her final session was with 500 micrograms. She
talked to the devil and told him: &quot;Look, I tried it your way
and what has it got me?&quot; She then had the feeling that
&quot;God&quot; reached out his hand to her, and she was debating
whether or not to grasp it. Following this experience, the
patient seemed to be in a psychotic or depersonalized state,
became very depressed and planned suicide. She wrote a suicide
note in the midst of which she fell asleep, awoke in the morning
and found she was still alive. The last word she had written in
her suicide note was &quot;church&quot; and she thought perhaps a
miracle had occurred. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This patient's experience also illustrates the need
for careful aftercare in order to prevent suicide and psychosis.<a
name="back12"></a><a href="#foot12"><sup>12</sup></a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; James' explanation of such experiences is
compelling: &quot;The difference between a sudden and a gradual
convert is not necessarily the presence of a divine miracle in
the case of one and of something less divine in that of the
other, but rather a simple psychological peculiarity, the fact
that in the recipient of the more instantaneous grace we have one
of those subjects who are in possession of a large region in
which mental work can go on subliminally and from which invasive
experiences abruptly upsetting the equilibrium of the primary
consciousness may come.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of these patients (treated with LSD) equate
forgiveness of sins with healing. The relentless conscience has
relented and now the patient is freed of guilt: Thus the old
cycle of drink to still guilt, and drink giving rise to guilt, is
broken. With the slate wiped clean, the patient is free to deal
with the guilt of the moment rather than the guilt of the
accumulated years. Borrowing from analytic metapsychology we
might say the unconscious superego has become conscious, though
it is still projected onto God rather than recognized as part of
the self. Made conscious, it has lost some of its minatory
quality.<a name="back13"></a><a href="#foot13"><sup>13</sup></a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The conversion reaction is only one type of
spiritual experience which might lead to recovery from
alcoholism; but there is still another and more basic one: the
mystic experience. James has suggested that one of the
motivations for drinking is to achieve an actual mystic
experience: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The sway of alcohol over mankind is
unquestionably due to its power to stimulate the mystical
faculties of human nature, usually crushed to earth by the cold
facts and dry criticisms of the sober hour. Sobriety diminishes,
discriminates and says No. Drunkenness expands, unites, and says
Yes. It is in fact the great exciter of the Yes function in man.
It brings its votary from the chill periphery of things to the
radiant core. It makes him for the moment one with truth. Not
through perversity do men run after it. To the poor and
unlettered it stands in the place of symphony concerts and of
literature; it is part of the deeper mystery and tragedy of life
that whiffs and gleams of something that we immediately recognize
as excellent should be vouchsafed to so many of us only in the
fleeting earlier phases of what in its totality is so degrading a
poison. The drunken consciousness is one bit of the mystic
consciousness and our total opinion of it must find its place in
our opinion of that larger whole.&quot; A long-shoreman put it
more simply: &quot;If it weren't for whiskey, a poor man would
never know how a rich man feels.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What, then, is the need for this mystic experience
or the transcendental experience? I believe that Fromm has given
us the answer. The alcoholic suffers from alienation, from the
&quot;sickness of the soul.&quot; All that has been worthwhile in
him has been projected onto the outer world, whether it be God or
manna. All that is base is retained within himself. &quot;What is
his problem? Is it his drinking or is his drinking only a symptom
of his real problem, his failure to live a meaningful life? Can
man live with this degree of alienation from himself with so much
hate and so little love without feeling inferior and
disturbed?&quot; (12). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An illustration of this appeared in <i>Life</i>
sometime ago (1959) under the ironic title &quot;The Good
Life.&quot; The people therein portrayed are so discontented with
themselves that they are continually racing after power saws,
power motors, power boats. They cannot stand being with
themselves for a moment. They are alienated from themselves,
alienated from their universe. Their transcendental or creative
function is entirely blocked. Compare them with Wordsworth:</p>

<p> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hermits are contented with their cells; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And students with their pensive citadels: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; High as the highest Peak of Furness Fells, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In truth, the prison, unto which we doom <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ourselves, no prison is: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> Unlike Wordsworth's ideal, modern man is so completely
imprisoned and alienated that for him the happy idle hours become
a rat race, and the time waster spans his weekend with drink.
Many drinkers drink because their lives have lost purpose and
meaning. The old drunk might drown his sorrows; the modern drunk
fills the emptiness of his existence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The alcoholic attempts to find himself, to fulfill
himself with drink; but the attempt fails and now the guilt over
drink and the wasted opportunity has him trapped. How then may
LSD help with this situation? It may provide a genuine
transcendental or mystic experience instead of the spurious one
&quot;bit of mystic consciousness&quot; which the alcoholic has
been seeking. The artificial distinction between subject and
object, self and world, conscious and unconscious, ego, id and
superego are all abolished. The person is at one with the
universe. In his mystic selflessness he awakens with a feeling of
rebirth, often physically felt, and he is provided with a new
beginning, a new sense of values. He becomes aware of the
richness of the unconscious at his disposal; the energies bound
up in and by repression become available to him. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One patient during LSD was drawn into a mystic
experience by the sound of a floor buffer turning round and round
in the passageway. She was drawn into a mystic participation with
the writer and with God. Yet she struggled for her individuality,
even as Jacob wrestled with the Angel. Afterwards she said:
&quot;I recognized after this that I was strong, that I didn't
need to be afraid, that I didn't need to drink.&quot; She and her
husband had been refractory members of Alcoholics Anonymous for
years. Now that she has stopped drinking the husband has started
again.<a name="back14"></a><a href="#foot14"><sup>14</sup></a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What happens when we seek transcendence with LSD?
Once we open Pandora's box, we cannot always control what flies
out. The LSD experience may strip the patient of his capacity for
lies and rationalization; he may see himself in all his
psychological nakedness. To expose him so violently and suddenly
to his shortcomings may only increase his guilt to an intolerable
degree and leave him very depressed. He should, one would think,
have at least some &quot;glimpse of heaven&quot; if he is to be
&quot;saved.&quot; Some inner strength, some hope, some
creativity and some positive feelings must be revealed to him. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This brings us forcibly to the dangers of LSD
treatment. The transcendental experience may open up avenues of
creativity but it is not creativity itself; the experience of
revelation while present may lead the person to confuse fantasy
with actual achievement. Unless the constructive aspects of the
experience are sufficiently stressed, the individual may not have
the strength to face himself stripped of all his rationalizations
and projections, a &quot;herring lying in the gutter&quot; (2).
Therefore, unless he has some awareness of &quot;God's&quot;
mercy, unless he can come to terms with himself as through the
mystic experience, and unless he develops new and free energy
from the unconscious to alter his life situation, he may develop
not only a depression but a frankly paranoid reaction. The
intervention of the therapist makes the difference between a
helpful and a damaging experience. The therapist need arrogate no
religious attributes to himself; indeed he must resist the
temptation to believe in the omnipotent role in which he has been
placed. For if he does not, he will then reinforce, rather than
alleviate the pathological alienation which he is striving to
overcome. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is another danger which is shared with the
peyotists. For years government experts and anthropologists have
been warring as to whether peyote is or is not harmful. In point
of fact the writer has been able to find authentic evidence of
only one peyote psychosis, this on a brief personal visit to the
Navajo reservation. But the circumstances are instructive. This
was a young man who had branched out on his own. He had his own
private stock of peyote which he was nipping on the side, instead
of taking it during the highly formalized peyote ritual.<a
name="back15"> </a><a href="#foot15"><sup>15</sup></a> In the
same manner self-experimentation with LSD is clearly dangerous.
LSD strips off the protective barriers of the ego and all
sensitivity and perceptivity is heightened. The effect of any
input is heightened, so that the drug has great potential for
good and evil. It is possible to induce or reinforce unusual
beliefs which may alienate the individual from his society at a
time when he desperately needs it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, LSD causes an inflation of the ego which
may be an effective antidote for low self-esteem. Low
self-esteem, of course, has many roots. All Good is projected
onto God; all Bad is retained in the form of original sin within
oneself. There are other problems that derive from the Protestant
ethic. There is the stress on the outward evidence of grace as
seen by visible evidence of prosperity, the stress on social
mobility, the existential guilt arising from the fact that few
reach their actual potential: all this adds up to a sort of mass,
low self-esteem, a cosmic sense of inferiority, which is actually
increased by material achievement and accession of material
goods. Ordinary psychotherapy brings out a person's shortcomings
and not his assets. But LSD allows a person to face his
shortcomings with honesty, and at the same time experience some
of the wealth and reservoirs which lie within him. We can perhaps
promise that the Mute Inglorious Milton experience the raptures
felt by Milton, even if he cannot write his poetry. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We should also recall that Vergil guided Dante into
the Inferno and returned him safely, chastened and enlightened.
Those who would use LSD should do as well for their patients. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Case History of Excessive Drinking with Improvement
Following LSD <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This was a 30-year-old radiologist who consulted
the writer in 1959. He complained that for the past year he had
nightly drunk himself to sleep, and then awoke with nightmares in
the middle of the night. His wife would become enraged at being
awakened and he would spend the rest of the night crying. He was
depressed, unable to work. However, his chief complaint, of years
duration, was an inability to feel or experience. &quot;It was as
if I was inside a glass shell. I mean I could see out and people
could see in, but I couldn't talk or feel.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The patient was an only child, whose mother had
died when he was an infant. He was raised by foster parents until
the age of four and then repossessed by father and stepmother.
His relations with them were distant. His father reportedly
insisted on high standards of intellectual performance, always
blamed, never rewarded or praised. Raised as a strict Catholic,
the patient married out of the Church and was cut off by his
family. He abandoned the Church but it made little difference: as
he expressed it: &quot;When I was on a religious kick, it was
'I'm a sinner'; and essentially now it's 'I'm a neurotic.'&quot;
His purgatory was in effect merely moved from the future into the
present. Alienated from God, nature, man, church, mother and
family, he tried for reconciliation by conquering. His friends he
subdued with words, his patients with his X-rays, and the
universe with his theories. Only once in his life had he overcome
his alienation. During sexual relations with his secretary, out
in the moonlight, he felt &quot;At that instant I had contacted
the universe.&quot; He hoped for a repetition of this with his
wife, and had the unwisdom to tell her about it on their
honeymoon. But he felt nothing for her, could not love her. To
add to their misery she became pregnant and he had a psychotic
breakdown. She aborted but never forgave, never forgot nor
allowed him to forget. He wanted a reconciliation but his efforts
to force it only estranged them further. The patient said that he
had taken to drink to recapture the experience, but it failed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Psychotherapy seemed futile; words were used as
hostile ammunition and playthings; he fielded each interpretation
perfectly and returned the appropriate riposte, for he had read
and was well versed in Freud, Jung and Watts. Yet when he left
the hour, he had forgotten everything. It was the patient's
suggestion that LSD be tried, which was done after fourteen
preliminary psychotherapeutic interviews. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He began the session by using the drug as a
platform to preach his private philosophy. &quot;So anyway this
sort of thing, Goedel's proof, the Heisenberg principle of
indeterminacy, the insolubility of any mechanical problem that
contains more than two bodies by a method of other than
successive approximation.... There's me sub one and me sub two
and me sub one gets in the way of me sub two.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In order to turn off this stream and direct him
inward we tried some abstract paintings and then Bruckner.
&quot;Anyway I'd like to hear a little Bruckner now. Oceanic
feelings. Da dum da da dum. That is what Bach did for a living,
Bach did for kicks.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bruckner's music was an effective stimulus: the
patient became ill and then suddenly experienced the nightmare of
which he had complained. He shook with fear, trembled and sobbed:
&quot;I'm afraid, I'm afraid. I keep looking; there is nothing
there; what am I afraid of?&quot; I replied: &quot;Perhaps that's
what you are afraid of: nothing.&quot; With this the nightmare
disappeared, and years later the patient reported that it had
never returned. At that moment he reported a mystic
enlightenment, a kind of <i>satori</i>. He experienced feeling,
closeness with the therapist, with himself and the universe (and,
after the session, with his wife). In the evening he telephoned
to tell me how grateful he was. He had experienced completely
successful sexual relations for the first time. He began to pour
his energy into his work, and nightly drinking sessions were no
longer required. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the therapist he seemed profoundly changed, and
for the better. His wife, on the contrary, became much upset,
bitter, angry and depressed. She reminded the patient
continuously: &quot;You're no different; besides it won't last;
you'll see.&quot; A self-fulfilling prophecy. We thought to
rectify the situation by repeating the LSD experience with the
patient, by giving the wife an LSD experience, and then arranging
a joint LSD session. The first two were accomplished, but not the
third. She refused, saying it was a terrible experience. (During
the LSD the observer would have thought she was having a
delightful experience.) Eighteen months of intensive conjoint
family therapy were required before she could accept the
possibility of his being well. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Three years after the first consultation we learned
that he was a professor of radiology at a leading university; and
the couple was happily expecting a baby.</p>

<h4>Footnotes</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot8"></a>8. Monroe Tsa Toke, from whom
this quotation is taken, has done paintings which are
unquestionably the best illustration of the Peyote ritually and
the peyote visions. <a href="#back8">(back)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot9"></a>9. A controversy still rages
about peyote and its value for alcoholism. Slotkin quotes Hensley
[1908] with approval: Jilt [peyote] cures us of our temporal ills
as well as those of a spiritual nature. It takes away the desire
for strong drink I myself have been cured of a loathsome disease
too horrible to mention. so have hundreds of others. Hundreds of
drunkards have been dragged from their downward way. La Barrel
however, is cynical about the antagonism of alcohol and peyote.
&quot;One can eat lobsters one day and ice cream the next, but
one ought not eat them the same day (15).&quot; Radinss <i>Crashing
Thunder</i> (19) gives an eloquent account of his cure of chronic
alcoholism with delirium tremens by the use of peyote. Radin
himself remained skeptical. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;So completely did all those who joined the
peyote cult give up drinking that many Indians and whites were at
first inclined to believe that this was a direct effect of the
peyote. However, this is an error. The correct explanation is
that John Rave, the leader of the cult, gave up drinking when he
became a convert and included this renunciation of all liquors in
the cult which he so largely moulded and dominated. If any
additional proof were needed it can be found in the fact that as
Rave's personal influence decreased and as the membership
increased the number of people who drank liquor and ate peyote at
the same time increased.&quot; But Radin overlooks the fact that
John Rave gave up drinking because of peyote! <a href="#back9">(back)</a>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot10"></a>10. The figure of 70 percent
is taken from Hoffer (2) and covers a five-year period, The data
on which the present paper is based, however, derive from a
series of 20 hospitalized alcoholics (in addition to the M.R.I.
patients). They were treated in the same manner described by
Terrill except the dosage ranged from 150 to 500 micrograms.
Fifty percent had stopped drinking at the time of this symposium.
Unfortunately follow-ups could not be obtained. <a href="#back10">(back)</a>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot11"></a>11. Following this experience
she stopped drinking, became interested in psychotherapy and I
referred both her and her husband to a psychiatrist. He was an
ex-alcoholic who had a spontaneous religious conversion and he
insisted hers was synthetic and not genuine, Three years later he
finally proved his point. My sympathies are somewhat with her.
After listening to him on the phone for long periods in the late
evening I have often found a drink very soothing. <a
href="#back11">(back)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot12"></a>12. After a period of
accelerated drinking, dope taking and dalliance, this patient
straightened out, returned to the church, and according to last
report (1961) had made a good adjustment for two years. <a
href="#back12">(back)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot13"></a>13. The mere evocation of the
superego into conscious form is not in itself curative. It occurs
in terrifying fashion in delirium tremens, and can occur in
terrifying fashion with LSD. In the writer's opinion it is the
support of the therapist and his ability to maintain contact with
the patient that makes the difference in the outcome. <a
href="#back13">(back)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot14"></a>14. She has since found it
prudent to bolster her new found strength with antabuse, to
counteract her husband's importuning her to drink. <a
href="#back14">(back)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot15"></a>15. The writer has found that
warnings against self-experimentation (22) are ineffective: it is
like telling children not to put beans up their noses. <a

<h3>LSD and the New Beginning</h3>

<h4>DONALD D. JACKSON, M.D.</h4>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The experience of LSD and the new beginning is
similar to what the existentialist Ellenberger (10) has called
the Encounter: &quot;Encounter is, in general, not so much the
fortuitous meeting and first acquaintance of two individuals, but
rather the decisive inner experience resulting from it for one
(sometimes for both) of the two individuals. Something totally
new is revealed, new horizons open, one's Weltanschauung is
revised and sometimes the whole personality is restructured. Such
encounters are manifold, perhaps with a philosopher who reveals a
new way of thinking, or with a man of great life experience, of
practical understanding of human nature, of heroic achievements
or independent personality. An encounter can bring a sudden
liberation from ignorance or illusion, enlarge the spiritual
horizon and give new meaning to life.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the writer nothing better exemplifies how LSD
can be useful to us. It can provide us with an encounter, a new
experience which will enlarge our horizon and give new meaning to
life. These experiences are a part not just of therapy, but of
life itself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While in analytic training, I took a three-day
vacation during which I tried a new role&#151;that of a salesman.
I happened to meet another salesman and played the role quite
enjoyably for the whole weekend. For my analyst this was an
acting out of the transference, but I think this view expresses
only one side of the coin. Not being a doctor, not being a
psychiatrist even for a few days forced me to develop different
sets of behavioral tactics and with them a different aspect of me
that was enriching. Chancing to meet another person with whom I
was compatible reinforced the behavioral change. I feel that
there is an analogy in this experience to what <i>can</i> happen
with LSD. The new experience under LSD can be reinforced by
social experiences and further experience with the therapist.
Without this reinforcement the LSD experience gradually pales and
dies away; it becomes a memory, not a personality change. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not everyone is grateful for a new experience.
Galileo's contemporaries refused to look at the moons of Jupiter
through his new telescope. And some of our contemporaries refuse
to contemplate the intricacies of the LSD experience, or having
contemplated them are unable to process the new data. For them
the experience is unpleasant as is the inability to handle new
data. For many this experience cannot be handled, and leads to
grandiosity and rationalizations. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of our professional subjects and patients,
learned philosophers, psychologists and psychiatrists, are unable
to relax and enjoy the revelations of LSD. Instead of marveling:
&quot;My God, I've never been in this land before,&quot; they
explain, interpret and deny all in terms of their conventional
framework. Instead of enjoying the beautiful simplicity of
planetary motion, they pile epicycle on epicycle. They cling
desperately to the old familiar terminology; they maintain a
death grip on their &quot;cathexes&quot; and
&quot;repressions&quot;; and clinging to the old, they cannot let
go and be intrigued with the new. Acute discomfort is their lot,
if they cannot hammer their data onto the cross (chi-square) of
their old methodology.<a name="back16"></a><a href="#foot16"><sup>16</sup></a>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The early references to the LSD experience as a
schizophrenic-like psychosis were, in my opinion, the natural
outgrowth of casting the new in the old mold. If the therapist
views the experience as a psychosis he unwittingly helps the
patient develop a psychosis not through suggestion alone but also
because he cannot offer the patient a framework to handle the new
experience. The therapist must furnish adequate help in
processing the new data, or a paranoid reaction, ranging from
transitory suspicion or accusation to paranoia of several months,
may set in. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In early work with LSD, when the therapist failed
to provide the Encounter, psychotic reactions were inevitable.
This led to overgeneralization of the effects of psychotomimetic
drugs. (More accurately, perhaps, we should speak of psycholytic
drugs given by psychosogenic therapists.) The therapist provided
the paranoid reaction by withholding vital information; just as
with mental illness <i>sui genesis</i>, society and the therapist
foster the paranoid reaction by withholding vital data. And often
the patient fosters this by refusing to extract the data or,
having extracted them, refusing to look at them. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bavelas (3) has devised ingenious experiments to
demonstrate the effect of withholding data. He has given
insolvable problems to a highly motivated, highly intelligent
group of engineers; they were encouraged to solve the problem,
and inevitably came up with an erroneous answer. The
confrontation that they had the erroneous solution and that they
could not have solved the problem, far from providing
enlightenment, only led them to hold to their false solution with
delusional and dogmatic intensity, increasingly buttressed by
false rationalizations. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Having suffered once from the withholding of data,
they now refused to process the new data. Could they then have
been tested with LSD would they then have had sudden
enlightenment, or would they have developed fixed paranoic ideas
of being played with? Almost surely it would have depended on the
Encounter with the therapist. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We speak of a new experience with LSD. What does a
new experience mean and how can it be beneficial in specific
terms? Let me give an example of a patient, a professor, a man of
brilliant promise yet suffused with hopelessness because of an
abiding fear of insanity. He had once the misfortune to consult a
world-famous analyst about a marital problem, and had been told
that he was a pseudoneurotic schizophrenic and unanalyzable. This
had been a somewhat less than happy encounter. Given a hopeless
prognosis and refused treatment, he was left for years to
alternate between lethargy and desperation. In desperation he
consulted me and in desperation we tried LSD after a long period
of counseling and preparation. His first session (100 micrograms)
was uneventful, devoted mainly to a preliminary survey of the
unknown and the establishment of trust in the situation. In the
next session (150 micrograms) he plunged boldly into the
psychotic state, became wildly agitated and was forcibly
restrained. Together we came face to face with the insanity he
had feared and together we mastered it. He was able to take the
wraps off and let himself go because he knew that he and I could
see it through together. Instead of finding nothing but the
monster of pseudoneurotic schizophrenia thinly veiled in
professorial robes, he found a phantom which he could discard,
and he also found his real self, a living human being. A far more
fortunate encounter than his first. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes this may be followed by depression. It
has happened where families have not been able to support the new
experience and the new changes, where for them the new beginning
is fraught with danger.<a name="back17"></a><a href="#foot17"><sup>17</sup></a>
Now when we give LSD we insist that the marital partner be
involved in the situation lest divorce or depression supervene.
Another patient had a remarkable &#151;and
unfortunate&#151;experience. He was verbally attacked so roundly
by his depressed wife that within a month's time she had brought
him lower than when he started. Two years of family therapy were
required to restore what had been lost in a single day.<a
name="back18"></a><a href="#foot18"><sup>18</sup></a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Encounter may be illustrated by the following
brief case history. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The patient was a 35-year-old accountant who had
been in intensive psychotherapy for five years because of chronic
depression and crippling obsessive traits. He had had a brief
psychotic reaction and had made an abortive attempt at
self-castration. His oldest sister was a semi-invalid; he was
placed in a position of great responsibility for her; yet he had
always to be deferential and to accept continuous criticism. He
had no pleasant experiences of adolescence, and no dating. At the
beginning of therapy he complained of intense loneliness. Both
patient and therapist were frustrated by his meager progress. His
solid intellectual defenses were refractory to interpretation.
Occasionally he made efforts to improve his isolated social
position; each time he neatly sabotaged the effort. He improved
slightly, worked a little better, and became a little less
depressed; but if anything his isolation and loneliness were
intensified. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because of the complete affect block we decided
that he should have LSD (despite the history of a previous
psychotic break). He agreed and was given 100 micrograms of LSD.
He seemed more relaxed and a bit more happy. Yet, though we
focused on his relations to his father, there was little affect,
little recall and no fantasy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The writer thought that surely there must be some
fantasy available in this constricted personality. What kind of a
fantasy might such a boy, with such a father, have had? Surely he
would have been pleased to have buried his father in a shallow
grave, supine; and if Father died like Balzac's M. Beaucoq with
his lance erect (because he was hanged) so much the better; and
if he reverentially mowed the grass over his father's grave, and
if each passage of the blades over his father's grave cut a
little deeper, there might be a gradual diminution, or shearing
off of the parental authority, a trimming of the father imago. I
shared this fantasy with the patient and suggested that he might
well have had such a one. The effect was electric. He exploded
with laughter. The feelings and fantasies about father came
pouring out, as though Moses had smote the rock. For the balance
of the afternoon we reveled in an exchange of fantasies about his
father. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From that day he was a changed man. Previously he
had been a Milquetoast at work, whom everyone pushed around. Now
he became self-assertive and positive. He no longer let advantage
be taken of him. He was poised and comfortable. It occurred to
him he might do better working by himself. During the next LSD
session (150 micrograms) he was able to continue the work of the
preceding session. With the dread father laid to rest, he could
relive his adolescent days with the therapist, not as they had
been, but as they might have been. He expressed for the first
time the desire for a girl. In the month following, astounding
changes developed. He developed a sense of humor; he became
efficient; he began to date; he made plans to leave his job and
set up his own business, and this he actually accomplished. He
enjoyed dating and experienced intense sexual feelings. In
therapy he expressed the desire for marriage and children. He
struck up a friendship with another man, with whom he discussed
topics formerly tabu: sex and women. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Following LSD he began to have intense dreams,
sometimes pleasurable, often in color, which he had not had
before. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In seventeen (now nineteen) years of practicing
psychotherapy I have never seen as much change in an individual
with a rigid obsessional character. The change has been
permanent. While it has leveled off, there has been no
backsliding since our first Encounter using LSD.<a name="back19"></a><a

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The LSD experience is considered a complex
transaction of the amount of material given, the psychological
and physical environment, the set or expectancy and the
personality of both the patient and therapist. According to the
structuring of the situation, a psychotic-like (psychotomimetic),
a psychotherapeutic (in the sense of facilitating psychotherapy),
or a transcendental reaction may evolve. The psychotic-like
reaction may emerge where the intent is to produce and study
psychoses, where excess stress and insufficient security is
provided, and where the therapist fails to help the patient
process new and unfamiliar data. The psychotherapeutic reaction
is an intensification of the conventional therapeutic process and
leads to an intensification of the traditional psychotherapeutic
values of recall, reliving, insight and emotional release. These
may be experienced where they had not been before the
administration of LSD. The transcendental reaction is a temporary
loss of differentiation of the self and the outer world. It may
lead to a lessening of alienation, to a rediscovery of the self,
to a new set of values, to the finding of new potential for
growth and development and to a new beginning. This may be
followed by a change in behavioral patterns, as in the cessation
of drinking. If the environment (including therapist) supports
these changes, they may become a part of the patient's habitual
reaction patterns. Otherwise, the social matrix will remold the
patient and the LSD experience will become a memory rather than
an integral part of the personality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An historical paradigm of the therapeutic use of
LSD-25 is found in the use of peyote by the Plains Indians, in
the treatment of alcoholism.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot16"></a>16. The logical conclusion
of Jackson's remarks would be to jettison all previous models.
However, in the discussion he implied that a model borrowed from
psychoanalysis and existentialism might be constructed. Vikter
Tausk (25), in his essay on the origin of the influencing
machine, describes the human need for causal explanations and the
fantastic distortions of familiar explanations to process
unfamiliar data. <a href="#back16">(back)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot17"></a>17. This is a danger common to
many therapies, including psychoanalysis (13). <a href="#back17">(back)</a>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot18"></a>18. See footnote 7 (first
patient) and Savage's illustrative case history, above. <a
href="#back18">(back)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="foot19"></a>19 Dr. Jackson's fantasy may
have been suggested by one of our patients who had the
hallucinatory experience of roasting his father over a slow fire
in Hell, experiencing the most intense glee as he basted him.
Despite its effectiveness one is hard put to explain its success.
But it seems to have combined an accurate representation of the
patient's feelings with complete nonsense. Thus it derives much
of its force from its absurdity, much as the Zen masters drive a
point home by a seeming absurdity. The combination of the LSD and
the complete nonsense allowed the patient to see the complete
absurdity of his continued subservience to his father, to get
beyond it and to achieve the new beginning. A sensible
interpretation would probably have remobilized intellectual
defenses and demolished the whole LSD experience. (We have
learned [1962] that this former patient is now president of his
men's service club.) <a href="#back19">(back)</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In recent years, how to regard the &quot;forms of
consciousness entirely different&quot; induced by mescaline,
LSD-25, and psilocybin has posed a seemingly perplexing issue.
For articulate self-experimenters from Mitchell to Huxley,
mescaline has provided many-splendored visual experiences, or a
life-enlarging sojourn in &quot;the Antipodes of the mind&quot;
(2). For Stockings, it may be recalled, mescaline produced
controlled schizophrenia (3)&#151;a thesis which earned the
Bronze Medal of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association and
apparently inaugurated, in conjunction with the advent of LSD-25,
a period of concerted chemical activity in the exploration and
experimental induction of &quot;model psychoses&quot; (4). In
counterpoint, this same so-called &quot;psychotomimetic&quot; LSD
has increasingly found use as a purposeful intervention or
&quot;adjuvant&quot; in psychotherapy (5). The recently arrived
&quot;magic mushroom,&quot; psilocybin, has been similarly
equivocal&#151;&quot;psychotogenic&quot; for some,
&quot;mysticomimetic&quot; for others (6). The present paper will
review the literature on drug experience&#151;paying particular
attention to the effects of <i>extradrug</i> variables, for the
realization of the extent of their potential influence has only
recently crystallized, and promises to reduce some of the
abundant disorder in this area. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The phenomenon of drug-associated rapid personality
or behavior change will be discussed in some detail. For example,
a number of different alcoholic treatment facilities, especially
in Canada, have reported, for many of their patients, complete
abstinence after a single LSD session (7). More generally,
neurotic ailments over the full range have been described as
practically evaporating (8). Given this picture, and the present
state and practice of the therapeutic art, it is not surprising
to find at least one psychiatrist envisioning &quot;. . . mass
therapy: institutions in which every patient with a neurosis
could get LSD treatment and work out his problems largely by
himself&quot; (9). James would have been much attracted by the
&quot;spectacular and almost unbelievable results&quot; (10)
reported on the modern drug scene; and, in fact, their
resemblance to the &quot;instantaneous transformations&quot;
attendant on &quot;mystical&quot; religious conversions
&#151;which he discussed so eloquently&#151;may well be more than
superficial and seems worthy of attention.</p>

<h4>The Equivalent Action of Mescaline, LSD-25, and Psilocybin </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Since the evidence and testimony accumulated
over the years on the separate drugs will be treated
interchangeably, this raises a preliminary point of some
importance. Although the conclusion was delayed by both
dissimilarities in their chemical structure and differing modes
of introduction to the scientific community, it is now rather
commonly adjudged that the subjective effects of mescaline,
LSD-25, and psilocybin are similar, equivalent, or
indistinguishable. Both Isbell and Abramson have administered LSD
and psilocybin in the same study; Wolbach and his co-workers have
administered all three. All have found that their subjects were
unable to distinguish between the drugs (11). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The reported equivalence in subjective reactions
seems quite consistent&#151;or at least not
inconsistent&#151;with present pharmacodynamic knowledge. Studies
of radioactively tagged mescaline and LSD indicate that the
compounds largely disappear from the brain in relatively short
order&#151;in fact, at about the same time that the first
&quot;mental phenomena&quot; make their appearance (12). Hence,
it has been tentatively suggested that the characteristic
effects, which persist for a relatively long period, are to be
attributed not to the action of the drug itself but to some as
yet unidentified aspect of the chain of events <i>triggered</i>
by drug administration. Isbell, observing the &quot;remarkably
similar&quot; reactions to LSD and psilocybin, hypothesized
&quot;some common biochemical or physiological mechanism&quot; to
be responsible for the effects&#151;that is, that the various
compounds share a final common path (13). The most direct support
for this inference of biological identity in ultimate mechanism
of action has come from cross-tolerance studies wherein subjects
rendered tolerant to one drug&#151;that is, nonreactive after
repeated administrations &#151;have then been challenged by a
different drug. Present indications are that cross-tolerance
among the drugs does in fact develop (14). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is not intended to suggest that a drug
experience is invariable among subjects&#151;quite the contrary
has been the case. In fact, experiences even for the same subject
differ from one session to the next (15). But when relevant
extradrug variables are controlled, the within-drug variance is
apparently coextensive with between-drug variance, and is
attributable to ubiquitous personality differences; in other
words, while a range of reactions is reported to <i>all</i> of
the drugs, there is no reaction distinctively associated with any
particular drug. Extradrug variables, which have been
uncontrolled and largely unrecognized until recently, are
apparently responsible for much of the variance erroneously
attributed to specific drug action.</p>

<h4>Invariant Drug Reactions</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; By common consent, the drug experience is
paranormal&#151;that is, beyond or outside the range of the
normal, the everyday. Exclamations of &quot;indescribable&quot;
recurrently appear in the literature. However, whenever
descriptions are essayed, there is relative unanimity about
certain features. These, it may be said, are attributable to the
drug administration, per se, independent of the personality of
the subject, the setting, or the experimenter's or subject's
expectations. A sampling from the literature of subjective
reports and testimony may communicate, or at least transmit the
flavor of, these invariant reactions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; First, and perhaps most easily conveyed, is the
characteristic of the drug experience called by Ellis a
&quot;saturnalia&quot; or &quot;orgy&quot; of vision (16).
Subsequent authors have been only slightly more restrained: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The predominance of visual experiences in the picture is
    striking&#151; not only on account of the persistent
    hallucinations and illusions, but by the impressiveness of
    seen real objects, their shape and color.... (17) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>There is a great intensification of light; this
    intensification is experienced both when the eyes are closed
    and when they are open.... With this intensification of light
    there goes a tremendous intensification of color, and this
    holds good of the outer world as well as of the inner world
    (18). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>When I closed my eyes . . . I experienced fantastic images
    of an extraordinary plasticity. These were associated with an
    intense kaleidoscopic play of colors (19). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Changes in the perception of visual form occur in
    virtually everyone.... Consistently reported [are] the
    plasticity which the forms of the visual world assume . . .
    the emphasis upon play of light and color, as though light
    were alive (20). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A second invariant set of drug reactions, more
difficult to characterize or communicate, has been called,
variously, depersonalization, dissociation, levitation,
derealization, abnormal detachment, body image distortion or
alteration, and the like: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There is an awareness of an abnormal distance between the
    self and what happens in its consciousness; on the other
    hand, the experience of an abnormal fusion of subject and
    object (21). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>My ideas of space were strange beyond description. I could
    see myself from head to foot as well as the sofa on which I
    was lying. About me was nothingness, absolutely empty space.
    I was floating on a solitary island in the ether. No part of
    my body was subject to the laws of gravitation (22). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>What happens in the LSD experience? . . . the universe is
    overtly structured in terms of an identification between the
    perceiver and the thing perceived. You hear the music way off
    down in a cavern, and suddenly it is you who is way down in
    the cavern. Are you now the music, or is the music now at the
    mouth of the cavern? Did you change places with it? And so
    on? (23) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some degree of depersonalization probably occurs during
    every LSD experience . . . the detachment of the conscious
    self, a sort of detached ego. This self is in touch with
    reality and is in touch with the self experiencing the
    psychic phenomena (24). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Regardless of whatever else a drug experience may
be reported to include, alterations in visual experience and in
experience of self, as detailed above, may be predicted with
considerable confidence (25). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In connection with the so-called dissociation
phenomenon&#151; and in view of the connotations of the
&quot;psychotomimetic&quot; and &quot;intoxicant&quot;
labels&#151;it may be well to emphasize that drug experiences, at
least for most nonpsychotic subjects, do not seem to approximate
delirium: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The mescal drinker remains calm and collected amid the
    sensory turmoil around him; his judgment is as clear as in
    the normal state.... (26) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is difficult to classify the state of consciousness
    during the intoxication which allows such self-observation
    and, at times, seems to foster detachment and self-scrutiny
    (27). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . in a state of clear consciousness [the subject] . .
    . is able to describe in detail the manifold mental changes
    daring drug intoxication (28). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The nondelirious condition of normal volunteers, at
least with low to moderate drug dosage, has been objectively
attested by their ability to perform psychological tests. The
most exhaustive series of investigations along this line has been
carried out for LSD by Abramson and his associates (29).
Generally, although not consistently, subjects show slight
decrements in performance&#151;at least some of which may well be
attributable to an altered state of attention-motivation-affect.
However, the test setting itself seems to contaminate the drug
experience; Savage, among others, has noted &quot;a less profound
effect when subjects are kept busy doing psychological
tests....&quot; (30) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another and final set of seemingly invariant
reactions concerns the retrospective impressiveness of the drug
experience. The succession of testimonials to this effect is a
striking and salient feature of the history of research with
these compounds: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In some individuals, the &quot;ivresse divine&quot; is
    rather an &quot;ivresse diabolique.&quot; But in either case
    . . . one looks &quot;beyond the horizon&quot; of the normal
    world and this &quot;beyond&quot; is often so impressive or
    even shocking that its after-effects linger for years in
    one's memory (31). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The experience of the intoxication, as Beringer also
    observed, makes a particularly deep impression.... The
    personality is touched to its core and is led into provinces
    of psychic life otherwise unexplored; light is shed on
    boundaries otherwise dark and unrevealed and in this some aid
    may be given to Existenzerhellung (illumination of existence)
    (32). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . most subjects find the experience valuable, some
    find it frightening, and many say that it is uniquely
    lovely.... For myself, my experiences with these substances
    have been the most strange, most awesome, and among the most
    beautiful things in a varied and fortunate life (33). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>To be shaken out of the ruts of ordinary perception . . .
    this is an experience of inestimable value to everyone and
    especially to the intellectual . . . the man who comes back
    through the Door in the Wall will never be quite the same as
    the man who went out (34). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . the whole experience is (and is as) a profound piece
    of knowledge. It is an indelible experience; it is forever
    known. I have known myself in a way I doubt would have ever
    occurred except as it did (35). </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The &quot;Psychotomimetic&quot; Label</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; After the above renditions, a querulous reader
may be concerned about the appellation &quot;psychotomimetic
drugs.&quot; So are many contemporary researchers and therapists,
too numerous to mention. Holliday has provided a trenchant
analysis of &quot;how the semantics in the field of
psychopharmacology became so confused and generally
misleading&quot; (36); here, only a few points will be noted. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Early mescaline investigators clearly tempered
their comparisons between the mescal-induced state and the
hallucinations and dissociations of endogenous psychosis. As far
back as 1930, it was found that when chronic schizophrenics
suffering from persistent hallucinations were given mescal, they
distinguished the mescal phenomena, remarked on their appearance,
and usually blamed them on the same persecutors who had molested
them before (37). Kluver, though he foresaw and extensively
discussed the &quot;model&quot; values of mescal, persisted in
calling it &quot;the divine plant&quot; (38). It was apparently
difficult to consider a sacramental substance&#151;&quot;the
comfort, healer, and guide of us poor Indians . . . the great
teacher&quot; (39)&#151;as unequivocally psychotomimetic. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With LSD, a laboratory-born drug having no history
to contend with, the situation changed. The adventurous Hofmann,
on that fateful day in 1943, started his self-experiment with 250
micrograms of LSD, thinking, as he put it, that such a small
amount would probably be harmless. His response to this quite
large dose&#151;in terms of present-day experimental
standards&#151; was as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I noted with dismay that my environment was undergoing
    progressive change. Everything seemed strange and I had the
    greatest difficulty in expressing myself. My visual fields
    wavered and everything appeared deformed as in a faulty
    mirror. I was overcome by a fear that I was going crazy, the
    worst part of it being that I was clearly aware of my
    condition. The mind and power of observation were apparently
    unimpaired (40). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hofmann went on to list, as his most marked
symptoms, visual disturbances, motor restlessness alternating
with paralysis, and a suffocating sensation, and added:
&quot;Occasionally I felt as if I were outside my body. My 'ego'
seemed suspended in space. .. .&quot; (41) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Stoll, who in 1947 reported experimental
confirmation of Hofmann's experience, is widely reputed to have
warned informally of a case of suicide as the aftermath of an
experimental trial. The most common accounts thereafter had a
psychotic female subject committing suicide two weeks after the
administration; or, in another version, a subject committing
suicide after the drug had been administered without her
knowledge. At any rate, this story, though itself never appearing
in print, is referred to in one form or another in nearly all of
the early work with LSD; it apparently influenced experimenter
attitudes for a number of years. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For many and varied reasons, too involved to trace
here, the initial formulation of the &quot;model psychosis&quot;
properties of LSD engendered enormous investigative enthusiasm.
In this climate, latent reservations on the score of
psychotomimesis tended to go unvoiced. In the more recent,
postenthusiasm era, however, reservations have been more or less
vigorously expressed&#151;for example: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There are considerable differences between LSD-induced and
    schizophrenic symptoms. The characteristic autism and
    dissociation of schizophrenia are absent with LSD. Perceptual
    disturbances due to LSD differ from those due to
    schizophrenia and, as a rule, are not true hallucinations.
    Finally, disturbances of consciousness following LSD do not
    resemble those occurring in schizophrenia (42). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Many alternatives to the
&quot;psychotomimetic&quot; characterization of
&quot;hallucinogenic&quot; agents have recently been proposed. In
1957, Osmond offered, among others, &quot;psychelytic&quot;
(mind-releasing) and &quot;psychedelic&quot; (mind-manifesting)
(43). Other investigators have proposed consciousness-expanding,
transcendental, emotionalgenic, mysticomimetic, and so forth. It
becomes ever more apparent, though, that old labels never die
(44).</p>

<h4>Variable Drug Reactions and Extradrug Variables</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It may probably be stated as a pharmacopoeias
commonplace that the effects of a drug administration of any kind
are likely to be compounded by factors other than specific
pharmacologic action. Often this is attributed to
&quot;personality,&quot; to individual differences (45). However,
though there have been as yet very few controlled investigations
in the case of the drugs considered here, it has become
abundantly clear from the <i>systematic</i> variability reported
in subject and patient reactions&#151;in both the affective and
ideational dimensions of drug experience&#151;that factors other
than &quot;personality&quot; are also at issue. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Affective reactions attendant on a drug
administration have varied, according to reports, all the way
from hyperphoric ecstasy to unutterable terror&#151;though not
with all investigators. The opinion leader Hoch, through a decade
of observations, consistently maintained: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>LSD and mescaline disorganize the psychic integration of
    the individual.... (46) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . mescaline and LSD are essentially anxiety-producing
    drugs. . . . (47) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The following interchange was recorded at the 1959
conference on the use of LSD in psychotherapy held under the
auspices of the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>Hoch</i>: Actually, in my experience, no patient asks
    for it [LSD] again.<br>
    <i>Katzenelbogen</i>: I can say the same.<br>
    <i>Denber</i>: I have used mescaline in the office . . . and
    the experience was such that patients said, &quot;Once is
    enough.&quot; The same thing happened in the hospital. I
    asked the patients there if, voluntarily, they would like to
    take this again. Over 200 times the answer has been
    &quot;No&quot; (48). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Subsequently, Malitz also stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>None of our normal volunteers wanted to take it [LSD]
    again (49). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In contrast, DeShon and his co-workers reported the
results of the first LSD study done with normal subjects in this
country as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>... anxiety was infrequent, transient, and never
    marked.... All subjects were willing to repeat the test (50).
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The experience of other investigators has been
similar: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>During the past four years we have administered the drug
    [LSD] hundreds of times to nonpsychotics in doses up to 225
    micrograms. . . . Those who have participated in these groups
    are nearly always definitely benefited by their experiences.
    Almost invariably they wish to return and to participate in
    new experiments (51). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . few patients discontinue treatment, in fact,
    enthusiasm and eagerness to continue are among the features
    of LSD patients (52) . </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The rapidly expanding use of LSD in
psychotherapeutic contexts has provided highly revealing clues to
the patterning of extradrug variability. Busch and Johnson were
the first to report administering LSD to neurotic patients whose
therapy had &quot;stalled&quot; and whose prognosis was
&quot;dim.&quot; The result was &quot;a reliving of repressed
traumatic episodes of childhood,&quot; with &quot;profound&quot;
influence on the course of therapy (53). Sandison and his
colleagues also found that LSD &quot;produces an upsurge of
unconscious material into consciousness&quot; (54), and that
&quot;repressed memories are relived with remarkable
clarity&quot; (55)&#151;with therapeutically beneficial
consequences. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since these early reports, whenever
psychoanalytically oriented therapists have employed LSD,
practically without exception the patient relives childhood
memories. The interesting point is that this phenomenon has
practically <i>never</i> been noted in the experimental
literature! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jungian therapists, on the other hand, have
repeatedly found that their patients have
&quot;transcendental&quot; experiences&#151;a state beyond
conflict&#151;often with rapid and dramatic therapeutic results.
As a matter of fact, in an amusing and somewhat bemused account,
Hartman has described his LSD-using group comprised of two
Freudians and two Jungians, in which the patients of the former
report childhood memories, while those of the latter have
&quot;transcendental&quot; experiences. In addition, for Jungian
patients, the transcendental state is associated with
&quot;spectacular&quot; therapeutic results, while for Freudians,
should such a state &quot;accidentally&quot; occur, no such
spectacular consequence is observed (56). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While not from a therapeutic setting, the reports
which have emanated from Harvard are noteworthy on the score of
ideational content. Under psilocybin, Harvard subjects do not
relive their childhood experiences, but grapple with age-old
paradoxes: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . the problem of the one and the many, unity and
    variety, determinism and freedom; mechanism and vitalism;
    good and evil; time and eternity; the plenum and the void;
    moral absolutism and moral relativism; monotheism and
    polytheism and atheism. These are the basic problems of human
    existence.... We need not wonder that the Indians called the
    mushroom sacred and gave it a name which means &quot;the
    flesh of the god&quot; (57). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without multiplying or belaboring divergences
further, it should be apparent that affective reactions and
ideational content may be <i>systematically</i> variable
dimensions of drug experience; in addition, the possible
therapeutic uses or consequences, however these are conceived,
seem clearly variable. Once these &quot;facts&quot; are arrayed,
in Baconian fashion, they nearly speak for themselves. At the
Josiah Macy conference, the emerging consensus was perhaps best
expressed by Savage: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This meeting is most valuable because it allows us to see
    all at once results ranging from the nihilistic conclusions
    of some to the evangelical ones of others. Because the
    results are so much influenced by the personality, aims, and
    expectations of the therapist, and by the setting, only such
    a meeting as this could provide us with such a variety of
    personalities and settings. It seems clear, first of all,
    that where there is no therapeutic intent, there is no
    therapeutic result. . . . I think we can also say that where
    the atmosphere is fear-ridden and skeptical, the results are
    generally not good.... This is all of tremendous
    significance, for few drugs are so dependent on the milieu
    and require such careful attention to it as LSD does (58). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The same conclusion has come from experimental
quarters as well&#151;for example: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[The effect] of hallucinogens is not limited to any single
    agent since, in addition to psilocybin, we have seen it with
    LSD-25 and mescaline. The environmental setting in which the
    drug is administered . . . affects the emerging behavior
    pattern. This factor may account for variations in results
    with different investigators. Our hospital setting, with the
    subject, a paid volunteer, receiving an unknown agent, in an
    experimental framework surrounded by unfamiliar doctors and
    nurses, differs markedly from the mystical setting which
    Wasson observed.... Only one of our subjects reported what
    might be described as a transcendental experience.... The
    differences in expectation and setting between these two
    grossly divergent groups may account in part for the
    disparity in their responses (59). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More specifically, anxiety in the therapist or
experimenter about administering the drug, about &quot;inducing
psychosis,&quot; seems likely to render the experience
anxiety-ridden for the subject. Abramson has flatly declared:
&quot;The response of the subject . . . will depend markedly upon
the attitude of the therapist.... In particular, if the therapist
is not anxious about the use of the drug, anxiety in the patient
will be much decreased&quot; (60). Hyde has reported that
&quot;impersonal, hostile, and investigative attitudes&quot;
arouse hostile and paranoid responses (61). Sandison has observed
that the occurrence of anxiety seems largely to depend on
&quot;what the patient is told beforehand [as well as] rumors and
myths current among patients and staff, or even in the press,
about hallucinogenic drugs&quot; (62). Huxley had intimated this
before it became clarified in the psychiatric literature: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . the reasonably healthy person knows in advance that,
    so far as he is concerned, mescaline is completely
    innocuous.... Fortified by this knowledge, he embarks upon
    the experience without fear&#151;it: other words, without any
    disposition to convert an unprecedented strange and other
    than human experience into something appalling, something
    actually diabolical (63). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That the positive or negative character of the
experience can be systematically directed, overriding even
personality factors, seems now to have been fairly conclusively
demonstrated. With &quot;adequate&quot; preparation&#151;that is,
with the specific intent of rendering drug experiences
&quot;positive&quot;&#151;approximately 90 percent of the
subjects or patients, in each of the two most recent studies,
reported at least a &quot;pleasant&quot; or &quot;rewarding&quot;
session, and nearly as many called it &quot;an experience of
great beauty&quot; or something equally superlative (64). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In content, as in affect, subjects apparently
respond to the implicit or explicit suggestion or expectation of
the therapist or experimenter. The Harvard subjects were prepared
for their metaphysical binges, it may be noted, with such
assigned readings as the &quot;Idols of the Cave&quot; parable in
Plato's <i>Republic</i> and passages from <i>The Tibetan Book of
the Dead</i>. The preparation of psychotherapy patients hardly
needs specification. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, what may be said about therapeutic
implications?&#151; given the fact that the compounds under
discussion may induce a powerful paranormal experience whose
affective and ideational content can be guided. Only perhaps that
the extent to which the experience can serve as a useful adjunct
to traditional interview therapies, or vice versa, or even as a
&quot;compleat therapie&quot; would seem to depend on the
particular practitioner of the art&#151;his conceptions of
therapeutic gains and consequences, his philosophy and
enthusiasm, and his orientation toward &quot;placebo&quot; or
&quot;faith&quot; cures (65). Schmiege has summarized the current
state of affairs as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Those using LSD in multiple doses as an adjunct to
    psychotherapy feel that it is so useful because of its
    ability to do the following: (I) It helps the patient to
    remember and abreact both recent and childhood traumatic
    experiences. (2) It increases the transference reaction while
    enabling the patient to discuss it more easily. (3) It
    activates the patient's unconscious so as to bring forth
    fantasies and emotional phenomena which may be handled by the
    therapist as dreams. (4) It intensifies the patient's
    affectivity so that excessive intellectualization is less
    likely to occur. (5) It allows the patient to better see his
    customary defenses and sometimes allows him to alter them.
    Because of these effects, therapists feel that psychotherapy
    progresses at a faster rate. Of course this poses the age old
    problem of what is the essence of psychotherapy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There are many reports of patients receiving
meaningful insight about themselves in an LSD experience without
the intervention, participation or even presence of a
therapist.... Those who administer lysergic acid in a single dose
have as their goal, in the words of Sherwood, <i>et al</i>., an
overwhelming reaction &quot;in which an individual comes to
experience himself in a totally new way and finds that the age
old question 'Who am I?' does have a significant answer.&quot;
Frequently, this is accompanied by a transcendental feeling of
being united with the world.... Some spectacular, and almost
unbelievable, results have been achieved by using one dose of the
drug (66) .</p>

<h4>Rapid Personality Change</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; An increasing number of subjects, patients,
experimenters, and psychiatrists&#151;spontaneously or with
priming&#151;have declared their drug experiences to be
transcendental, mystical, cosmic, visionary, revelatory, and the
like. There seems to be difficulty in finding the right name for
the experience, even among the professional so-called
&quot;mystics&quot;: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There is no really satisfactory name for this type of
    experience. To call it mystical is to confuse it with visions
    of another world, or of god and angels. To call it spiritual
    or metaphysical is to suggest that it is not also extremely
    concrete and physical, while the term &quot;cosmic
    consciousness&quot; itself has the unpoetic flavor of
    occultist jargon. But from all historical times and cultures
    we have reports of this same unmistakable sensation emerging,
    as a rule, quite suddenly and unexpectedly and from no
    clearly understood cause (67). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever this type of experience is called,
however, a growing body of &quot;expert&quot; testimony
apparently confirms the possibility of its induction by drugs.
Watts, the dean of current Western Zen scholars, has recently
described &quot;cosmic consciousness,&quot; courtesy of LSD, in
exquisite detail (68). Seminary students and professors in the
Boston area are said to have definitely concluded that their
contact with psilocybin was &quot;mystico-religious&quot; (as to
whether or not it was &quot;Christian,&quot; however, they are
still in doubt) (69). Huxley has been most outspoken about the
capacity of the drugs to induce &quot;traditional&quot;
mystical-visionary states: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>For an aspiring mystic to revert, in the present state of
    knowledge, to prolonged fasting and violent self-flagellation
    would be as senseless as it would be for an aspiring cook to
    behave like Charles Lamb's Chinaman, who burned down the
    house in order to roast a pig. Knowing as he does (or at
    least as he can know, if he so desires) what are the chemical
    conditions of transcendental experience, the aspiring mystic
    should turn for technical help to the specialists.... (70) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nearly invariably, whenever dramatic personality
change has been noted following the use of these drugs, it has
been associated with this kind of experience&#151;that is, one
called transcendental or visionary&#151;with the particular name
the experience is given seemingly most dependent upon whether the
investigator focuses on affect or content. These experiments in
drug-induced behavior change will shortly be reviewed in detail.</p>

<h4>Examples Not Associated with Drugs</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Since accounts of behavior transformations
attendant on paranormal experience are not without precedent, it
may be helpful to set the stage for present developments by
citing some examples not connected with drugs. James reported on
the phenomenon in its most familiar and perhaps prototypic
context: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In this lecture we have to finish the subject of
    conversion, considering it first through striking
    instantaneous instances of which St. Paul's is the most
    eminent, and in which, often amid tremendous emotional
    excitement or perturbation of the senses, a complete division
    is established in the twinkling of an eye between the old
    life and the new. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After adducing numerous examples, James continued: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I might multiply cases almost indefinitely, but these will
    suffice to show you how real, definite, and memorable an
    event a sudden conversion may be to him who has the
    experience. Throughout the height of it he undoubtedly seems
    to himself a passive spectator or undergoer of an astounding
    process performed upon him from above. There is too much
    evidence of this for any doubt of it to be possible.
    Theology, combining this fact with the doctrine of election
    and grace, has concluded that the spirit of God is with us at
    these dramatic moments in a peculiarly miraculous way, unlike
    what happens at any other juncture of our lives. At that
    moment, it believes, an absolutely new nature is breathed
    into us, and we become partakers of the very substance of the
    Deity (71). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One may also recall to mind the
&quot;vision-seeking&quot; American Indians whom Ruth Benedict
immortalized. Adapting Nietzsche's designation
&quot;Dionysian&quot; to characterize their cultural pattern, she
portrayed its fundamental contrast with the
&quot;Apollonian&quot; Zuni-Pueblo way of life. The Dionysian
&quot;seeks to attain in his most valued moments escape from the
boundaries imposed on him by his five senses, to break through
into another order of experience.&quot; He values &quot;all means
by which human beings may break through the usual sensory
routine&quot; (72). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Widespread among the western Indians (except in the
Pueblos) was what Benedict called the &quot;Dionysian dogma and
practice&quot; of the vision-quest&#151;sought by fasting, by
torture, and by drugs. The point of interest, of course, is that
when the vision came, it could apparently trigger large-scale
behavior alterations which had the stamp and reinforcement of
social approval. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . on the western plains men sought these visions with
    hideous tortures. They cut strips from the skin of their
    arms; they struck off fingers; they swung themselves from
    tall poles by straps inserted under the muscles of their
    shoulders. They went without food and water for extreme
    periods. They sought in every way to achieve an order of
    experience set apart from daily living. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>On the western plains they believed that when the vision
    came, it determined their life and the success they might
    expect. If no vision came, they were doomed to failure.... If
    the experience was of curing, one had curing powers; if of
    warfare, one had warrior's powers. If one encountered Double
    Woman, one was a transvestite, and took woman's occupations
    and habits. If one was blessed by the mythical Water-Serpent,
    one had supernatural power for evil, and sacrificed the lives
    of one's wife and children in payment for becoming a sorcerer
    (73). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The final example which will be noted here of rapid
personality change not induced by drugs has emerged quite
recently from Maslow's studies of &quot;self-actualization.&quot;
Maslow reports that the occurrence of a dramatic &quot;peak
experience&quot;&#151; defined or alternatively described as a
&quot;cognition of being,&quot; or as &quot;mystic&quot; or
&quot;oceanic&quot;&#151;is a major event in the life histories
of his &quot;self-actualizing&quot; subjects. Maslow avers
&quot;unanimous agreement&quot; among his subjects as to the
&quot;therapeutic&quot; after-effects of such peak
experiences&#151;for example, that they were so profound as to
remove neurotic symptoms forever; or were followed by greater
creativity, spontaneity, or expressiveness; or produced a more or
less permanently changed, more healthy world-view or view of
self, and so on (74).</p>

<h4>Drug-Associated Personality Change: A &quot;New Concept&quot;
in Psychotherapy</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is an intriguing historical accident that, on
the one hand, anthropological studies of the Native American
Church (Peyotism) consistently record the peyote-associated
reformation of alcoholic and generally reprobate characters (75),
and, on the other hand, LSD has been increasingly utilized in the
treatment of the white man's &quot;fire-water&quot; ills. LSD was
first systematically administered to non-Indian alcoholics in
order to explore a putative similarity between the so-called
model psychosis and delirium tremens. Two independent
undertakings along this line, one in the U.S. and one in Canada,
resulted in highly unexpected and sudden &quot;cures&quot; (76). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Investigators in Saskatchewan pursued this
serendipitous result aggressively. The outcome, with
lately-evolved refinements in technique, has been an explicitly
formulated &quot;new concept&quot; in psychotherapy (77). The
following narrative, pieced together from Hoffer's statements at
the Macy LSD conference, describes the conditions under which the
rapid change phenomenon seems first to have occurred in sizeable
numbers: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . we have what we call the &quot;businessman's
    special,&quot; for very busy people, the weekend
    treatment.... They come in because the police or Alcoholics
    Anonymous or others bring them in. They come in on day <i>one</i>.
    They know they are going to take a treatment, but they know
    nothing about what it is. We take a psychiatric history to
    establish a diagnosis. That is on day <i>one</i>. On day <i>two</i>,
    they have the LSD. On day <i>three</i>, they are discharged.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Our objective [in using 200-400 gamma doses] is
    to give each patient a particular LSD experience.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The results are that 50 per cent of these
    people are changed [that is, they stop drinking or are much
    improved].... As a general rule . . . those who have not had
    the transcendental experience are not changed; they continue
    to drink. However, the large proportion of those who have had
    it are changed (78). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The only other investigators to report a
&quot;weekend treatment&quot; are Ball and Armstrong (79). They
describe a small series of &quot;sex perverts,&quot; at least two
of whom had had, over a number of years, &quot;a variety of forms
of psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis . . . [resulting in]
no improvement whatever.&quot; The large-dose LSD experience,
however, is said to have had &quot;remarkable, long-lasting
remedial effects&quot; (80). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; MacLean and his co-workers in British Columbia,
Canada have reported on a series which included 61 alcoholics and
33 neurotics (personality trait disturbance and anxiety reaction
neurosis) (81). Each patient was carefully and intensively
prepared for the 400-1500 gamma, &quot;psychedelic
LSD-day&quot;&#151;which was jointly conducted by a psychiatrist,
a psychologist, a psychiatric nurse, and a music therapist. Their
follow-up data (median follow-up was for 9 months) were
interpreted to yield a &quot;much improved&quot; or
&quot;improved&quot; rating for over 90 percent of the neurotics
and 60 percent of the alcoholics, with just under 50 percent of
the alcoholics found at follow-up to have remained &quot;totally
dry&quot; (82). The results of this single LSD session with the
alcoholic cases seem most impressive, in view of the picture
provided: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>These were considered to be difficult cases; 59 had
    experienced typical delirium tremens; 36 had tried Alcoholics
    Anonymous and were considered to have failed in that program.
    The average period of uncontrolled drinking was 14.36 years.
    The average number of admissions to hospital for alcoholism
    during the preceding 3 years was 8.07 (83). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since Hoffer's account, procedures in Saskatchewan
have apparently been modified to incorporate considerable
&quot;psychotherapy&quot;&#151;as an adjunct to, and preparation
for, the LSD experience. In a recent report, Jensen has described
a greatly expanded treatment method and its results: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The treatment program includes three weekly A.A. meetings.
    The patients are strongly encouraged, but not forced, to
    attend. There are also 2 hours of group psychotherapy, in the
    course of which those who are not already familiar with the
    A.A. program are indoctrinated mainly by the other patients'
    discussion.... Because of the fairly short time available,
    the group therapy is superficial in nature and primarily
    educational.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward the end of hospitalization (which
    averaged 2 months), the patients were given an LSD
    experience. They routinely received 200 gamma of the drug....
    (84)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Of 58 patients who experienced the full
    program, including LSD, and were followed up for 6 to 18
    months, 34 had remained totally abstinent since discharge or
    had been abstinent following a short experimental bout
    immediately after discharge; 7 were considered improved,
    i.e., were drinking definitely less than before; 13 were
    unimproved; and 4 broke contact.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Of 35 patients who received group therapy
    without LSD, 4 were abstinent, 4 were improved, 9 were
    unimproved and 18 were lost to follow-up.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Of 45 controls, consisting of patients admitted
    to the hospital during the same period who received
    individual treatment by other psychiatrists, 7 were
    abstinent, 3 improved, 12 unimproved, and 23 lost to
    follow-up (85). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Among the reservations that might be expressed
about Jensen's study, two are outstanding. First, there is some
ambiguity about the assignment of patients to the different
treatment conditions&#151;it does not seem to have been entirely
random. Second, Jensen's assumption that patients who broke or
refused follow-up contact with the hospital staff are safely
categorized, for statistical purposes, as &quot;treatment
failures&quot; would seem somewhat overweening. At any rate, on
his count, the difference in percentages of patients
&quot;abstinent or improved&quot; between the &quot;full
program-LSD&quot; group (41 out of 58, or 71 percent) and the
&quot;individual psychotherapy&quot; group (10 out of 45, or 22
percent) was highly statistically significant. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The present &quot;official policy&quot; of the
Saskatchewan Department of Public Health may be of interest. A
recently issued document, which reviews the results of four such
follow-up studies as Jensen's, concludes with the directive that
the single, large-dose LSD treatment of alcoholism is to be
considered &quot;no longer as experimental,&quot; but rather,
&quot;to be used where indicated&quot; (86). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There seem to have been only two efforts in the
U.S. to explicitly and systematically follow the Canadian model.
In quite different contexts, both are reported as at least
&quot;doing well.&quot; Leary and his co-workers at Harvard, over
the last two years, have conducted a research and treatment
program at Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Concord,
&quot;designed to test the effects of consciousness-expanding
drugs on prisoner rehabilitation&quot; (87). This undertaking,
which emphasizes the crucial importance of drug-induced
&quot;far-reaching insight experiences&quot; &#151;prepared for,
supported, and reinforced by group therapy sessions&#151;has
resulted in a recidivism rate considerably reduced from actuarial
expectation. The number of post-treatment cases on which this
evaluation is based, however, is only 26. The program is ongoing
(88). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a much more familiar setting, a group of workers
on the West Coast has been treating the full range of
garden-variety neuroses. The patients are intensively prepared
over a two- to three-week period for a large-dosage,
&quot;transcendental&quot; drug session. The stated intent is to
induce a &quot;single overwhelming experience . . . so profound
and impressive that . . . the months and years that follow become
a continuing growth process&quot; (89). Thus far, in over 100
treated cases, at least &quot;marked improvement&quot; in the
condition for which treatment was sought has been reported in
about 80 percent&#151;after one so-called overwhelming experience
(90). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a commonplace that new psychiatric treatments
seem to effect remarkable cures&#151;at least for a short time
and in the hands of their originators. In raising the spectre of
the powerful placebo effect (91), it need hardly be pointed out
that the results reviewed above should be regarded with healthy
skepticism. On the other hand, they are more than merely
trifling.</p>

<h4>Explanatory Concepts</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In addressing a recent international assemblage
at Copenhagen, Leary asserted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The visionary experience is the key to behavior change.
    [In its wake] change in behavior can occur with dramatic
    spontaneity . . . (92). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Van Dusen, who bids fair to become the
psychologist-philosopher of the &quot;new concept&quot; movement,
puts the issue as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There is a central human experience which alters all other
    experiences . . . not just an experience among others, but .
    . . rather the very heart of human experience. It is the
    center that gives understanding to the whole.... It has been
    called satori in Japanese Zen, moksha in Hinduism, religious
    enlightenment or cosmic consciousness in the West.... Once
    found life is altered because the very root of human identity
    has been deepened . . . the still experimental drug
    d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) appears to facilitate the
    discovery of this apparently ancient and universal experience
    (93). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although reminded on all sides of the
incommunicableness of &quot;the transport,&quot; as James called
it, of its ineffability, one may, before following him in the
descent toward &quot;medico-materialistic&quot; explanation,
inquire further of its nature. James proffered the traditional
demurrer &quot;. . . it is probably difficult to realize [its]
intensity unless one has been through the experience one's self .
. .&quot; (94). He then proceeded, with seeming aplomb, to
describe it: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The central [characteristic] is the loss of all worry, the
    sense that all is ultimately well with one, the peace, the
    harmony, the <i>willingness</i> to be.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The second feature is the sense of perceiving
    truths not known before . . . insight into depths of truth
    unplumbed by the discursive intellect.... The mysteries of
    life become lucid ... illuminations, revelations, full of
    significance and importance, all inarticulate though they
    remain.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A third peculiarity . . . is the objective
    change which the world often appears to undergo. &quot;An
    appearance of newness beautifies every object&quot; . . .
    clean and beautiful newness within and without . . . (95). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In James' view, &quot;melting emotions and
tumultuous affections&quot; were the constant handmaiden of
&quot;crises of change&quot; (96). Also Benedict, in the context
of the vision-quest, remarked on &quot;. . . very strong affect,
either ultimate despair or release from all inadequacy and
insecurity&quot; (97). Chwelos and his co-workers, describing the
transcendental drug experience as &quot;mainly in the sphere of
emotions or feeling&quot; (98), exemplify this by quoting an
alcoholic patient: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I was swept by every conceivable variety of pleasant
    emotion from my own feeling of well-being through feelings of
    sublimity and grandeur to a sensation of ecstasy (99). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally now, turning from the poetry of phenomenal
experience to medico-materialism, how did James approach the
matter of explanation? </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you open the chapter on Association, of any treatise on
    psychology, you will find that a man's ideas, aims, and
    objects form diverse internal groups and systems, relatively
    independent of one another.... When one group is present and
    engrosses the interest, all the ideas connected with other
    groups may be excluded from the mental field.... Our ordinary
    alterations of character as we pass from one of our aims to
    another, are not commonly called transformations . . . but
    whenever one aim grows so stable as to expel definitively its
    previous rivals from the individual's life we tend to speak
    of the phenomenon and perhaps to wonder at it, as a
    &quot;transformation.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether such language be rigorously exact is
    for the present of no importance. It is exact enough, to
    recognize from your own experience the fact which I seek to
    designate by it. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Now if you ask of psychology just <i>how</i>
    the excitement shifts in a man's mental system, and <i>why</i>
    aims that were peripheral become at a certain moment central,
    psychology has to reply that although she can give a general
    description of what happens, she is unable in a given case to
    account accurately for all the single forces at work.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In the end we fall back on the hackneyed
    symbolism of mechanical equilibrium. A mind is a system of
    ideas, each with the excitement it arouses, and with
    tendencies impulsive and inhibitive, which mutually check or
    reinforce one another.... A new perception, a sudden
    emotional shock . . . will make the whole fabric fall
    together, and then the center of gravity sinks into an
    attitude more stable, for the new ideas that reach the center
    in the rearrangement seem now to be locked there, and the new
    structure remains permanent (100). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More modern discussions of rapid personality change
seem, in large part, to be variations on the theme of
&quot;melting emotions and tumultuous affections.&quot; There
have been two relatively recent efforts to deal with rapid change
associated primarily with conversion. Wallace, who attempted an
heroic amalgam of Selye's &quot;stress&quot; theory and cultural
anthropology, summed this up as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . the physiologic events of the general adaptation
    syndrome [in situations of massive emotion] establish a
    physicochemical milieu in which certain brains can perform a
    function of which they are normally incapable: a wholesale
    resynthesis that transforms intellectual insight into
    appropriate motivation, reduces conflict by partial or total
    abandonment of certain values and acceptance of others, and
    displaces old values to new, more suitable objects (101). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sargant has linked along an axis of abnormal
&quot;anger, fear, or exaltation&quot; such &quot;abrupt total
reorientations&quot; in personality as attend religious and
political conversion experiences&#151;as well as violent
abreactions in therapy, spontaneous or narcosynthetic. His
explanatory scheme derives directly from Pavlov&#151;in the final
analysis, sudden alterations in behavior are attributed to
&quot;paradoxical&quot; and &quot;ultraparadoxical&quot; brain
processes, and the like, induced by extreme emotion (102). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To return to LSD-related developments, Ditman and
his coworkers have reviewed a whole range of considerations and
theories which might &quot;rationalize&quot; the sudden change
phenomenon&#151;including a highly libidinized psychoanalytic
formulation (103). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It remains to raise just one final query. Rapid
personality change, translated into language more congenial to
behavioral psychology, could be taken to describe a situation in
which formerly dominant or high-probability responses, overt or
mediational, were suddenly greatly reduced in frequency of
occurrence; and, vice versa, uncommon responses, or those
formerly <i>low</i> in a hierarchy, appear with greatly elevated
frequency. The only experimental results which even approximate
this order of events seem to be those which have arisen with the
aid of direct intracranial electrical stimulation. With
response-contingent reinforcement of this kind&#151;that is, with
electrical &quot;trains&quot; delivered to the hypothalamic,
so-called pleasure or reward centers&#151;the repertoires of many
rats and monkeys have been dramatically altered in a very few
moments: Utterly new behaviors have been shaped, old responses
eliminated (104). The degree to which such &quot;artificially
induced&quot; learning has been sustained has been a function, as
with all behavior, of the ebb and flow of environmental
contingencies. Thus, to point the issue: Do transcendental
experiences at the human level, however they are interpreted,
tread in this area of <i>super</i>reinforcement&#151;with a
potential for radically altering the probability of occurrence of
&quot;heuristic&quot; mediating processes (for example, positive
rather than negative self-concepts) which might channel behavior,
at least temporarily, in new directions, toward a &quot;new
beginning&quot;?</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With Ruth Benedict's &quot;Apollonian&quot; Zuni,
the tendency of the modern West is to regard paranormal
experiences, indiscriminately and often with little idea of their
nature, as &quot;pathological&quot;&#151;to be distrusted,
feared, avoided. The Zuni Indian, said Benedict, &quot;finds
means to outlaw them from his conscious life. . . . He keeps the
middle of the road, stays within the known map, does not meddle
with disruptive psychological states&quot; (105). It would seem
unfortunate were this <i>Zeitgeist</i> to unduly prejudice the
exploration of therapeutic potential in the drugs here discussed.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In conclusion, let it be noted that the public
health implications of drug-associated rapid personality change,
should this phenomenon prove not to be a will-of-the-wisp, are
apparently great. Intensive investigation would seem a reasonable
order of the day. The procedures and time involved are manifestly
economical&#151;in truth, there seems little to be lost.</p>

definite alterations in firing at a number of points in the
visual system (also in auditory evoked potentials) and in the
functioning of cortico-cortical (transcallosal) connections.
However, in concluding an extensive review of
electrophysiological results, Evarts warned: &quot;. . . it does
not appear that we have reached the point of being able to assign
any particular psychological effect . . . to a demonstrated
disturbance of the electrical activity of the nervous
system.&quot; See Edward V. Evarts, &quot;A Review of the

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For many years several pharmacologically similar
drugs&#151;lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25), psilocybin, and
mescaline, among others&#151;have been of special scientific
interest. In volunteer subjects, they have been known to produce
a variety of intense and unusual psychic effects. These include
bizarre visual phenomena, ranging from heightening of the
apparent brightness or beauty of colored objects in the
environment, through distortions in the perceived nature or
meaning of real objects (illusions) to true visual hallucinations
of colors, shapes, or even of complex scenes or events. These
visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often
rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild
apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or
by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not
experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions. Subjects
describe changes in body image, the body or its parts appearing
larger or smaller, intense feelings of depersonalization,
including states in which the subject believes he is outside his
own body viewing it from afar, or even sensations of death and
rebirth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Occasionally there may be loss of insight into the
drug-induced nature of these sensations, with paranoid delusions
about other people in the environment who are believed to be
trying to harm or kill the subject. Intense self-loathing with
suicidal impulses or great feelings of mystical revelation can
also occur. Distortions in experiencing passage of time and, more
rarely, disorientation as to time and place can occur. The exact
quality, nature, and content of these experiences appear to
depend in a complex manner on the personality and expectations of
the subject, the dose of the drug, and the setting in which the
drug is administered (1, 2). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Particularly since the synthesis of LSD-25 in 1943,
there has been intense scientific interest in the possibility
that these agents reproduce naturally occurring schizophrenic
states. After twenty years of research, it seems most reasonable
to state that these drugs can produce a state which is similar
but not identical to naturally occurring schizophrenia, and which
may also resemble the toxic deliria caused by other agents such
as atropine or scopolamine. Since subjects acquire tolerance to
LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline after repeated administration
(3-6), the possibility that such compounds are of etiological
significance in naturally occurring schizophrenia seems remote. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because of the assumed similarities of the state
produced by these agents to schizophrenia, they have been termed
&quot;psychotomimetics&quot; or mimickers of psychosis. Even less
accurately, because of the visual effects, they have been termed,
&quot;hallucinogenics.&quot; These names reflect a careful
scientific concern with potentially dangerous, though unique
drugs. More recently Osmond (7) has coined a term,
&quot;psychedelic,&quot; meaning &quot;mind manifesting,&quot;
which has begun to be used widely. Its implications are certainly
more vague than those of the other terms. In the contexts in
which it is used, it seems to imply that these drugs bring to the
fore aspects of the subject's mind previously hidden or at least
less manifest, and suggests that these effects may be
&quot;good.&quot; Assuredly, many investigators believe that the
effects of these drugs result in an intensity of personal
experience and emotion more meaningful than the terms
&quot;psychotomimetic&quot; or &quot;hallucinogenic&quot; imply. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Therein lies the present problem in the use or
abuse of these agents. Rather than being the subject of careful
scientific inquiry, these agents have become invested with an
aura of magic, offering creativity to the uninspired,
&quot;kicks&quot; to the jaded, emotional warmth to the cold and
inhibited, and total personality reconstruction to the alcoholic
or the psychotherapy-resistant chronic neurotic. On the West
Coast, the effects are judged by some to be related to the
insights of Zen Buddhism; on the East Coast, they are judged by
others to lead the way to a new and free social order. Like the
broom in &quot;The Sorcerer's Apprentice,&quot; the drugs seem to
have walked out of the laboratory into the outside world on their
own feet and to have turned on the unsuspecting apprentice. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To be sure, the therapeutic uses of these agents
have been pioneered by psychiatrists in many instances, including
Abramson (8), Frederking (9), Osmond (7), Savage (10, 11), and
Sandison (12, 13). With much of the published work, however,
there is an implicit or explicit attitude that the self-knowledge
of the leverage for self-change allegedly effected by these drugs
may be of value or benefit to individuals who do not ordinarily
consider themselves psychiatrically ill. At the extreme of this
attitude-dimension is the International Foundation for Inner
Freedom, formed by two psychologists, Doctors Leary and Alpert,
who claim that these agents (14) should not be considered drugs
at all but should be classed with poetry, music, literature, and
art, and should be available to all men wishing to improve their
minds and &quot;expand their consciousness.&quot; There is,
apparently, an active black market in these drugs in major urban
centers, where these drugs may have more snob appeal than
diacetyl morphine (heroin), marihuana, or dextroamphetamine. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Major attention has been focused on these drugs,
their effects, and the personal eccentricities and misadventures
of the more notorious people advocating their use by a series of
articles in national popular magazines&#151;<i>Look</i> (14), <i>The
Reporter</i> (15), <i>Cosmopolitan</i> (16), <i>Time</i> (17),
the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> (18), and the <i>Ladies' Home
Journal</i> (19). As with other forms of illicit drug abuse, it
is hard to tell the real extent or seriousness of the
psychotomimetic problem, despite this rather florid publicity. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The present article has two purposes: first, to
underline the real and important dangers inherent in the
self-administration of these agents or in their administration by
uncritical enthusiasts and inadequately trained individuals;
second, to stress that some of the therapeutic claims made for
these drugs are of sufficient potential importance to warrant
serious, unprejudiced study. </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Psychotomimetic Agents as Therapy</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We take the second issue first, since the first
issue has already been outlined above. There have been an
increasing series of studies reporting LSD-25 and/or mescaline to
be effective in the treatment of chronic alcoholism, with
remission rates of approximately 50 percent being usually
described (20-25). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Similar results have been observed in the treatment
of chronic neuroses (9, 10-13, 26, 27). The claims for the
utility of these drugs in the treatment of chronic neuroses range
from dramatic improvement to modest descriptions of improved
communication with the therapist, emotional release, and ability
to talk about difficult personal topics. There have also been
informal claims that these drugs are useful in producing valuable
personality changes in juvenile delinquents and other individuals
with serious personality disorders. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In brief, it is claimed that these agents are of
striking value in some groups of patients who are highly
resistant to more conventional forms of psychotherapy or
pharmacotherapy. Many of these claims stress, further, the
occurrence of basic changes in attitudes or personality, not mere
symptom reduction. If these claims are confirmed, this new
therapeutic approach could add substantially to the
psychiatrist's tools. We must stress that none of these claims
are based on detailed, carefully controlled studies designed to
be free from possible distortions due to bias or enthusiasm.
Further, the terms in which the effects are often explained are
not formulations common either to medicine in general or to
psychiatry in particular. &quot;Our own conception is that people
live an inauthentic existential modality (i.e., alienation), and
that illness arises from an inability to see meaning in life. LSD
provides an encounter which brings a sudden liberation from
ignorance and illusion, enlarges the spiritual horizon and gives
a new meaning to life&quot; (11).Such explanations may have a
mystical or philosophical sound which appeals to the enthusiast,
but they are likely to produce doubt or even violent disbelief
and concern in physicians used to a more pragmatic approach and
in scientists used to a more communicative language. The present
authors occupy a skeptical middle position, favoring the Scotch
verdict of &quot;not proven.&quot; We feel strongly that this
approach to therapy should neither be rejected out of hand as
&quot;crazy,&quot; nor accepted and applied in an uncritical
manner, but should be subjected to careful study under closely
controlled conditions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is important also to note that the
&quot;treatment&quot; discussed above is not a drug therapy in
the conventional sense. It is, rather, a complex mixture of drug
therapy and brief psychotherapy, with one or more prolonged
sessions, lasting eight to ten hours, during which the patient
experiences the drug effect and discusses his experiences and the
light they throw on his problems, needs, and past experiences in
a prolonged and intensive manner. The drug session is usually
preceded by several interviews in which the patient's problems
and the changes he desires from treatment are explored, a
relationship with the therapist is established, and strong
positive expectations concerning the drug session are developed.
The treatment, as administered by many, seems to include strong
suggestion, aspects of dynamic insight-oriented psychotherapy,
mystico-religious exhortation, catharsis, and pressure on the
patient to confront his problems head on. It is possible that
with all these components the intense and bizarre drug experience
may indeed permit an impact on the subject not obtainable by any
other means. It is difficult to break down the therapeutic
process into its component parts. The proportions of the
components may vary from therapist to therapist or from patient
to patient, especially with regard to the amount of therapist
interpretation and the extent of his active participation in the
solution of the patient's problems. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When this treatment is given in a hospital setting,
there is also considerable personal interaction between the
individual patient and other patients who have already undergone
this experience or are about to undergo it. The whole milieu has
an aura of intense conviction that change will occur and that the
experience will be highly meaningful and highly therapeutic.
Intensive group therapy sessions may occur before and after the
actual LSD experience. The entire therapeutic process, including
preparation for the psychotomimetic experience and subsequent
reinterpretation of it, may resemble the group interaction common
to successful experience with Alcoholics Anonymous. It may
resemble also the intense personalinteraction used at the
National Training Laboratory, at Bethel, Maine (16), where
revelations and emotional experiences are created by intensive
interpersonal and group interaction alone, without the aid of any
drug. </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Problems in Evaluation</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This form of treatment is, therefore, highly
intense and highly complex, necessitating strong convictions and
great sensitivity on the part of the therapist, and requiring the
creation of a social milieu in which all patients not only share
in a strong conviction that change will occur but also hold a
personal commitment to make certain that change does occur.
Dramatic short-term effects under such conditions have been
described. The durability on prolonged follow-up study of acute
changes in behavior, induced by therapy or perhaps even changes
in personality, is yet to be determined. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Several problems face investigators who wish to
make careful studies of such a complex treatment. It seems likely
that people who administer the treatment effectively must be
convinced of its efficacy. Further, they must be highly biased in
favor of it for the treatment to have the described effect. The
physician may be so involved in the treatment that he can not
evaluate its effects objectively. Independent evaluation of
outcome is, therefore, essential to any good research design in
this area. This independent procedure should make it easier to
evaluate the efficacy of treatment in a condition like chronic
alcoholism where an objective index of success or failure,
namely, excessive drinking, exists. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A much more complex problem must be faced in
evaluating the effects of these drugs on individuals with
personality disorders, severe or mild. Here a value judgment must
be made concerning the goodness or badness of the changes which
occur, if any. For example, how should one evaluate outcome if an
individual were to divorce his wife and take a job which paid him
less but which he said he enjoyed more than his previous job? If
a person becomes more relaxed and happy go lucky, more sensitive
to poetry or music, but less concerned with success or
competition, is this good? There are suggestions that individuals
who take drugs like LSD either illicitly or as therapy may become
more detached from reality or less concerned with the real world,
more &quot;transcendental.&quot; A few of the reports concerning
this treatment, both published and unpublished, mix a variety of
poetic metaphors and occasionally bizarre-sounding elaborations
with serious descriptions of the details of treatment and the
valuable changes to be expected. For example, certain kinds of
artistic experience, certain types of music, etc., are said to be
particularly valuable in inducing the desired effects. Specific
components of the therapeutic process described may often have a
bizarre&#151;almost schizophrenic&#151;component, which tends to
make serious investigators discount this whole area as a
delusional belief shared by a group of unstable clinicians and
lay enthusiasts. Whether or not this criticism is justified can
be judged only by future studies designed to be immune to such
criticism. Future studies must decide whether these treatments do
indeed have promise for specific clinical conditions which are
now highly resistant to conventional psychiatric approaches. </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>The Current Situation</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At present a small number of facts are
strikingly clear. None of these drugs has been proved to be
effective or safe therapies for any psychiatric condition.
Because of the apparent potential of these agents for producing
bizarre behavior, suicidal impulses, or undesirable personality
change in some subjects or patients receiving them (28, 29),
there is some question as to whether they should be administered
outside a hospital. They are not available for general
prescription use, and there is some question whether they should
ever be so available. Because neither their safety nor their
efficacy has been adequately demonstrated, two of these agents,
LSD-25 and psilocybin, are being controlled as investigational
drugs in conformity with the existing Food and Drug
Administration regulations under the sponsorship of the drug
company which holds the patent rights for both substances. It is
our understanding that this company is at present providing these
agents for scientific study only to investigators functioning
within federal or state agencies with formal approval of the
agency, or to investigators doing research under ,rants from
these agencies. This policy decision has been made presumably to
insure that these drugs will not be misused by unqualified or
unscientific investigators without adequate checks and balances
necessary for safe and careful research. The other agent,
mescaline, is not to our knowledge being sponsored currently by
any pharmaceutical company, although it can be obtained for
animal or biochemical research from certain biochemical supply
houses. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Legally none of these agents can be used, even on
an investigational basis, except by investigators who have filed
a formal research plan with the FDA through a sponsoring
pharmaceutical company, or by investigators who have themselves
assumed sponsorship and satisfied the FDA concerning the safety
of the agents and their proposed research use in man. Any
reported use of these agents outside of these approved channels
should be reported to the FDA. Since there have been a number of
reports of suicide attempts or prolonged psychotic reactions
requiring psychiatric hospitalization in persons obtaining these
drugs outside of approved medical channels, their indiscriminate
unsupervised use is clearly dangerous. In addition, there have
been reports of insidious personality changes occurring in
individuals who have indulged in repeated self-administration of
these agents. It is, of course, difficult to determine whether or
not some of the bizarre behaviors of such individuals are a
product of the drug itself or are a product of the underlying
personality aberrations which lead the individuals to seek out
these agents. In any case, there is no evidence that uncontrolled
self-administration of these drugs is either safe or desirable.
There has also been concern over the possibility that
investigators who have embarked on serious scientific work in
this area may have been subject to the deleterious and seductive
effects of these agents. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thesee statements are made in hope that warranted
concern over illicit abuse of these agents will not prevent
systematic study of their possible potential in the treatment of
psychiatric conditions which are otherwise severely treatment
resistant. </p>

<p> <b>Introduction </b> </p>

<p> by Peter Webster </p>

<p> The following article is typical of the best of the
scientific community's resistance to the prohibition of further
use of psychedelics such as LSD, mescaline and psilocybin in
research and psychotherapy. By the mid-1960's, several important
studies had indicated not only the great safety of such use of
psychedelic drugs, but also the great utility of these age-old
medicines for a variety of modern curing techniques. The Canadian
government, for example, had approved psychedelic therapy as by
far the best and most effective treatment for alcoholism ever
devised. Yet the prohibitionists both in government and the
scientific establishment itself, soon carried the day and a Great
Inquisition began, first in the United States but later around
the world, in which even legitimate scientific research with
psychedelic drugs was completely stifled. A very small and
insignificant relaxation of these draconian restrictions has
recently occurred, but the research permitted of late has only
barely begun to re-trace the territory already well-covered in
the 1950's. The article is taken from pp 197-205 of The
Hallucinogens. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p> </p>

<p> Within a few months after LSD was introduced into North
America the ideas generated by the LSD experience produced a good
deal of criticism. The unhappy Harvard affair brought this
situation to a boil and it spilled over into the popular press.
Critics have been very effective in creating a climate of opinion
hostile to the use of LSD. There is an inverse square law which
states that the degree of hostile criticism varies inversely with
the square of the distance from any first-hand experience and
knowledge of the drug. </p>

<p> Thus, in Canada the greatest resistance against LSD came from
the professors who were least familiar with it. Our criterion of
familiarity is the number of research papers published in
scientific journals. </p>

<p> This criticism seems entirely based on factors described by
Barber (1961). These include (a) substantive concepts and
theories held by scientists at any given time, (b) an
antitheoretical bias, (c) religious ideas, (d) professional
standing, (e) professional specialization, and (f) societies,
schools, and seniority. The criticism has sometimes taken on a
cultic attitude and there has been private circulation of papers
which have been unavailable to the general reader (Tyhurst,
1964b). In addition, critics have issued public pronouncements to
the press, radio, and television which have not been based upon
published data. It is therefore important to list the criticisms
and then examine them carefully in order to determine whether
they need be taken seriously or not. Before doing so we will
quote Michael Polanyi (1956) because he makes the case so well.
If we are to convince our opponents of the potential value of LSD
therapy they must be converted by exposing them to careful data,
reasoned argument, and a firm determination to do our work as we
see fit and not to become their laboratory technician trying to
disprove every will of the wisp they may conjure up.<br>
</p>

<p> &quot;Scientists - that is creative scientists - spend their
lives in trying to guess right. They are sustained and guided
therein by their heuristic passion. We call their work creative
because it changes the world as we see it, by deepening our
understanding of it. The change is irrevocable. A problem that I
have once solved can no longer puzzle me; I cannot guess what I
already know. Having made a discovery, I shall never see the
world again as before. My eyes have become different; I have made
myself into a person seeing and thinking differently. I have
crossed a gap, the heuristic gap which lies between problem and
discovery. </p>

<p> &quot;To the extent to which discovery changes our
interpretive framework, it is logically impossible to arrive at
it by the continued application of our previous interpretative
framework. In other words, discovery is creative also in the
sense that it is not to be achieved by the diligent application
of any previously known and specifiable procedure. Its production
requires originality. The application of existing rules can
produce valuable surveys, but they can as little advance the
principles of science as a poem can be written according to rule.
We have to cross the logical gap between a problem and its
solution by relying on the unspecifiable impulse of our heuristic
passion, and must undergo as we do so a change of our
intellectual personality. Like all ventures in which we
comprehensively dispose of ourselves, such an intentional change
of our personality requires a passionate motive to accomplish it.
Originality must be passionate. </p>

<p> &quot;But this passionate quest seeks no personal possession.
Intellectual passions are not like appetites; they do not reach
out to grab, but set out to enrich the world. Yet such a move is
also an attack. It raises a claim and makes a tremendous demand
on other men; first it asks that its gift - its gift of humanity
- be accepted by all. In order to be satisfied, our intellectual
passions must find response. This universal intent creates a
tension. We suffer when a vision of reality to which we have
committed ourselves is contemptuously ignored by others. For a
general unbelief threatens to evoke a similar response in us
which would imperil our own convictions. Our vision must conquer
or die. </p>

<p> &quot;Like the heuristic passion from which it flows, the
persuasive passion too finds itself facing a logical gap. To the
extent to which a discoverer has committed himself to a new
vision of reality, he has separated himself from others who still
think on the old lines. His persuasive passion spurs him now to
cross this gap by converting everybody to his way of seeing
things, even as his heuristic passion has spurred him to cross
the heuristic gap which separated him from discovery. </p>

<p> &quot;We can now see the great difficulty that may arise in
the attempt to persuade others to accept a new idea in science.
To the extent to which it represents a new way of reasoning, we
cannot convince others of it by formal argument, for so long as
we argue within their framework we can never induce them to
abandon it. Demonstration must be supplemented therefore by forms
of persuasion which can induce a conversion. The refusal to enter
on the opponent's way of arguing must be justified by making it
appear altogether unreasonable. </p>

<p> &quot;Such comprehensive rejection cannot fail to discredit
the opponent. He will be made to appear as thoroughly deluded,
which in the heat of the battle will easily come to imply that he
was a fool, a crank, or a fraud. And once we are out to establish
such charges we shall readily go on to expose our opponent as a
metaphysician, a Jesuit, a Jew, or a Bolshevik, as the case may
be or - speaking from the other side of the Iron Curtain - as an
'objectivist,' and 'idealist,' and a 'cosmopolitan.' In a clash
of intellectual passions each side must inevitably attack the
opponent's person.&quot; </p>

<p> Here are the current claims made by critics: </p>

<p> 1. LSD is a dangerous drug. </p>

<p> 2. Long-term personality changes cannot be produced by LSD. </p>

<p> 3. No good can come from a chemically induced delirium or
psychoses. </p>

<p> 4. It &quot;has not been proved to be effective or safe for
any psychiatric condition&quot; (Cole and Katz, 1964). </p>

<p> (a) because there are no detailed, carefully controlled
studies designed to be free from possible distortions due to bias
or enthusiasm, </p>

<p> (b) because explanations given are often formulations not
common either to medicine in general or psychiatry in particular,
</p>

<p> (c) because explanations have a mystical or philosophical
sound which appeals to enthusiasts - but are likely to produce
doubt or even violent disbelief and concern in physicians used to
a more pragmatic approach, </p>

<p> (d) because components of the therapeutic process described
may often have a bizarre - almost schizophrenic - component which
tends to make serious investigators discount this whole area as a
delusional belief shared by a group of unstable clinicians. </p>

<p> Please read Polanyi's argument again. The rebuttal to these
criticisms is not difficult. </p>

<p> 1. Is LSD a dangerous drug? Of course it is, so is salt,
sugar, water, and even air. There is no chemical which is wholly
safe nor any human activity which is completely free of risk. The
degree of toxicity or danger associated with any activity depends
on its use. Just as a scalpel may be used to cure, it may also
kill. Yet we hear no strong condemnatory statements against
scalpels, etc. When LSD is used as treatment by competent
physicians who are trained in its use it is no more dangerous
than psychotherapy. It certainly is less dangerous than ECT
insulin subcoma, and the use of tranquilizers and antidepression
compounds. Statements that LSD is dangerous really are
meaningless as they stand. Every clinician working with LSD who
has published his data uniformly agrees it must be used by
physicians with proper safeguards for the safety of the patient.
There are no known physical contraindications. </p>

<p> 2. Long-term personality changes cannot be produced. There is
a curious quality about these criticisms for while it is
generally denied that patients who experience LSD can be
permanently changed it is, on the contrary, assumed that
psychiatrists very readily suffer permanent deformations of their
personality, and it is claimed that they are now overly
enthusiastic and even delusional and no longer competent to
honestly judge their own therapeutic efforts. It has been stated
that only claims made by therapists who have not themselves taken
LSD are valid (see Cole and Katz, 1964). If this argument were
generally accepted in medicine no surgeon who had recovered from
an acute appendicitis by surgery would be competent to judge
results of his surgery on patients. </p>

<p> The claims of many authors that the psychedelic experience
could produce a permanent change in patients have been rejected
by many psychiatrists whose orientation is psychoanalytic. It is
basic to their belief to assume that each person has a stable
personality which is altered with great difficulty. People become
sick because their personality has been warped or not allowed to
develop due to pathological relationships with their parents. The
only sure way of changing these twisted personalities is by a
thoroughgoing analysis of many years duration during which all
the roots of the pathological personality are uncovered and
treated. Any other treatment, psychotherapy, or drug therapy is
considered merely symptomatic treatment which leaves the patient
superficially better. Obviously these psychiatrists cannot accept
rapid permanent personality changes. Another group are
psychologists who have accepted the hypothesis that personality
is a stable attribute to man. </p>

<p> This reluctance to believe that people can be permanently
altered in a short time seems strange. History is replete with
these sudden transformations. Religions and mass self-help
movements, for example Alcoholics Anonymous, originated from
these changes. William James described many of them in &quot;The
Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; (1902). Unger (1963a) has
given a particularly lucid account of the issue of rapid
personality change. Maslow (1959) has described this phenomena as
&quot;peak&quot; experience and Sargant (1957) tried to abstract
those factors which make man susceptible to these rapid changes.
According to Sargant two factors are essential, (a) a state of
increased excitation in the subject, (b) persuasion. He included
psychoanalysis as one of the conversion techniques together with
religious conversions, etc. </p>

<p> We have already referred to research reports where permanent
personality changes were demonstrated (McGlothlin, 1962, 1964;
McGlothlin et al., 1964; Mogar et al., 1963, Mogar and Savage,
1964). </p>

<p> 3. No good can come from a chemically induced delirium or
psychosis. This criticism so contradicts man's experience with
drugs that it requires no answer. </p>

<p> 4. LSD has not been proved to be effective or safe for any
psychiatric condition (Cole and Katz, 1964). These critics assume
that no therapy is &quot;proved&quot; unless a double blind
comparison experiment is conducted. The word &quot;proved&quot;
is a strange one in clinical science. Usually clinical scientists
define the level of confidence or proof by a probability. That
is, they will if they are statistically inclined, accept a 5%
level of confidence. They will accept as proof a finding if there
is only 5% chance the claims are wrong. Others may demand much
stronger evidence and some may be satisfied merely with an
indication. In general no statement demanding proof has any
scientific meaning unless the author indicates which level of
proof he would accept. Using a puristic point of view one could
claim no psychiatric therapy has been &quot;proven&quot; to be
effective for any psychiatric condition. </p>

<p> Criticism 4(a) really is a demand for double blind studies of
LSD. The answer consists of two parts, (a) are double blind
studies really superior to classical methods in proving drug
efficiency and (b) is it possible to double blind LSD. </p>

<p> The majority of clinicians have not accepted the oft-repeated
claim that double blind techniques are superior to classical
clinical methods. As an example Baird (1964) stated &quot;The
insistence in recent years on 'blindness' or 'double blindness'
in evaluating the effect of therapy is an insult to the
intelligence of the average clinician.&quot; In addition a large
number of scientists who have worked with double blind procedures
have become increasingly disenchanted with it. It has been a
clumsy expensive method which has; not convinced anyone of its
value and which is readily dispensed with when decisive action is
required. The toxicity of thalidomide was not proven by double
blind studies nor have the many new drugs removed from the market
been proven toxic by double blind studies. It appears that when
firm action is indicated classical clinical methods are adequate,
but when matters of efficiency are involved these methods
suddenly become much too crude. </p>

<p> If Baird were unsupported one could ignore him, but when in
fact he is supported by (a) eminent statisticians such as Hogben
(1957), R. A. Fischer (1963), Chassan (1961, 1963, 1964), Bellak
and Chassan (1964), and by others we have reported (Hoffer and
Osmond, 1961a, 1962a,b), and by (b) eminent clinicians including
S. Cohen, H. Lehmann, and many others, and also (c) eminent
psychologists like H. Kluver, then we must ask the proponents of
double blind methodology to prove at the usual 5% level of
confidence that their methods are more apt to show which
chemicals are effective for certain conditions and which are not
effective. Until this is done no clinician need feel guilty about
using the old-fashioned clinical methods including single case
studies, for these were the methods which introduced into
psychiatry ECT, tranquilizers, antidepression drugs, open wards,
eradication of pellagra psychosis and of general pareses of the
insane, and a host of other minor treatments. Better methods will
and must be found and double blind methods are indeed useful in
mopping up studies. They do serve a useful function as
large-scale human toxicity trials and they are more convincing to
inspectorial physicians concerned about global efficacy. However
they have hung a millstone around our necks which is steadily
becoming more burdensome. It is ironic that one man's observation
(Lehmann on chlorpromazine) recently required one million dollars
to be confirmed - see million dollar fizzle ( Margolis, 1964). </p>

<p> Some critics (see inverse square law, p. 197) have suggested
that a placebo be used to double blind LSD. This betrays an
extraordinary lack of experience with LSD. No experienced
therapist would be in any doubt within one hour about determining
whether distilled water or 200 mcg of LSD had been given even if
he were blind and could not see the pupillary dilatation produced
by LSD. Every scientist who has worked with LSD agrees with this.
Only a person completely unfamiliar with psychiatry and with LSD
could mistake situational anxiety for the LSD reaction in a
nonpsychotic subject. It has been suggested further that a new
compound should be developed which would produce the same (or
similar) visual changes as LSD. But this is not helpful, since no
such compound is known, and if it were, would not prove anything,
for it is possible these visual changes are responsible for the
therapeutic results. There is no valid reason to suppose LSD is
more effective than psilocybin or mescaline. It is the experience
not the compound which induces it which is responsible. </p>

<p> However if double blind studies were possible investigators
would use them, not because they are better, but because they are
more fashionable. Perhaps pretreatment with penicillamine would
provide such a design. Statistically identical groups could be
pretreated with penicillamine and with placebo. Then all would be
given LSD in the usual way. The penicillamine would not interfere
with the perceptual component of the experience but would dampen
its emotional component. It would be very difficult for
therapists to decide which patients had received placebo or
penicillamine. One could then conclude that the normal LSD
experience was or was not superior to penicillamine-LSD. Our data
suggests that the improvement rates would be 10% after
penicillamine-LSD and 50% after LSD. However, even such a
controlled double blind experiment would not persuade the critics
for by then they could have produced newer unverified
suggestions. </p>

<p> Criticism 4(b) means little. Any new explanation if it is to
be new must be uncommon in medicine or in psychiatry. Commonality
of ideas is usually not appealed to by scientists. It applies
more to legal and ethical requirements in a court of law. However
we find Cole and Katz' (1964) statement most surprising.
Presumably they are unfamiliar with the enormous range of
theoretical formulations from conservative Freudism to radical
biochemical reasoning. We find it difficult to understand how
modern psychiatry which bases so much on random events, dreams,
ideas, and lapsae linguae can find any formulation uncommon. </p>

<p> Criticism 4(c) is very like 4(b). It is an inevitable
consequence of any new idea that it should produce violent
disbelief and concern in physicians We should remember that many
novel ideas of our past are commonplace today. Just a few
examples will demonstrate how science has reversed itself at
times. Mendelian theory was resisted from 1865 until about 1900
because Mendel's conceptions ran counter to predominant
conceptions of inheritance (were not common to medicine in
general). Mendel's peers condescendingly considered his work
insignificantly provincial (not common to medicine). </p>

<p> The application of mathematics to biology was seriously
questioned for many years. In his biography of Galton, Pearson
reported that he sent a paper to the Royal Society in 1900 which
used statistics. Before it was published the Council of the Royal
Society passed a resolution &quot;that in future papers
mathematics should be kept apart from biological
applications.&quot; Galton founded a new journal and in its first
issue wrote &quot;a new science cannot depend on a welcome from
the followers of the older one.&quot; Harvey, Pasteur, Magendie,
Lister, Funk and Fleming all found their ideas severely tested by
unreasoning hostile criticism because their ideas were uncommon.
It seems new ideas rarely are accepted with an open mind. </p>

<p> Criticism 4(d) is another variant of 4(b) and 4(c). Any new
explanation, however sound it may eventually prove to be, seems
bizarre, almost schizophrenic, to the defenders of the faith. But
it goes a bit further by the adhominem diagnosis of scientists
who use LSD for therapy as having states of paranoia (that is
sharing a delusional belief). This is, of course, a redundant non
sequitur for the definition of delusion is an uncommon idea from
which its possessor will not part when confronted with common
ideas. This is what these authors have already said in 4(b) and
4(c). </p>

<p> Many factors have been suggested which could account for the
therapeutic results claimed by LSD therapists. The usual ones
include faith, bad samples, bias in observers, etc. These are
possible factors but are they merely possible or are they likely?
Before they can be seriously accepted it must be shown that these
variables do improve a proportion of alcoholics. Where are the
double blinds which prove that faith, bias, etc. can produce
equivalent results? We suggest that proponents of these variables
should provide data for their favorite hypothesis before they
expect others to work them into their clinical studies. The
critics of LSD therapy would enormously strengthen their position
if they would demonstrate a double blind study of placebo or
faith. </p>

<p> The scientific literature [excluding editorials (Grinker,
1963, 1964) and review articles] is singularly affirmative. Every
worker who has studied LSD's use for treating alcoholism is in
unusual agreement. The only study recorded where there is some
disagreement is the study of Ditman et al. (1962). They examined
the duration of claims for improvement made by subjects who had
been given LSD. The authors stated &quot;the subjects had
originally been given 100 mcg of LSD-25 orally in a permissive
but non-treatment(1) setting in order to compare the LSD
experience with that of delirium tremens.&quot; Ditman and
Whittlesey (1959) again stated &quot;our subjects received no
intended psychotherapy during the LSD experience.&quot;
Questionnaires were sent to their subjects about 1/2 to 1 1/2
years after their last LSD experience and of those who responded,
27 were alcoholics. Of this group of 27, 18 subjects claimed they
were better, that they were in more comfortable circumstances,
earning more money, and had decreased or stopped drinking. </p>

<p> In as much as this group had not been given LSD as therapy or
in a therapeutic setting and had only received 100 mcg of LSD,
which we have found is relatively ineffectual for most
alcoholics, this is indeed a surprising result. </p>

<p> However, a second questionnaire two years later was answered
by only 16. Of the other 11, 4 had died, 3 from drinking. Of this
group of 16, 11 still claimed periods of abstinence ranging from
1 to 1 1/2 years and twelve claimed lasting benefit. These
authors state that this indicated fewer claims but a chi square
analysis of their own reported data does not support this
contention. Thus, in their first questionnaire, 18 out of 27
claimed improvement; in their second questionnaire, 11 out of 16.
Chi Square is less than 0.5. These results are practically
identical. However, none had maintained their sobriety. We
interpret this to mean that although nearly 2/3 of the group
maintained they were improved at the time of the second
questionnaire, three- and-one-half years after having had
received an ineffectual dose of LSD, none had been continuously
sober that entire period. </p>

<p> We mention this report in some detail because other people
have made claims based on this report not made by Ditman et al.,
that is, that LSD was not an effective therapy for alcoholism.
Their concluding statement merely stated &quot;Three and one-half
years after exposure to LSD there remained only claims of slight
improvement and none of the alcoholic subjects had maintained
their sobriety.&quot; Had they given 200 mcg or more with a
therapeutic objective in a therapeutic setting by therapists
interested in the therapeutic experience and had they used the
community resources including A.A., perhaps at three and one-half
years about 50% of their subjects or better would have been
sober. </p>

<h2>CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE TRENDS IN PSYCHEDELIC (LSD)
RESEARCH </h2>

<h5>ROBERT E. MOGAR</h5>

<p> from: J. Human Psychol., Vol. 2, 1965, pp. 147-166.</p>

<hr>

<p> Since the discovery of d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25)
in 1943, a voluminous literature has accumulated concerning its
effects on a variety of animals, including man. Despite the mass
of published reports, definitive evidence is generally lacking,
particularly with regard to the subjective and behavioral effects
both during and subsequent to the LSD induced state. It is well
established that this powerful agent produces major alterations
in cerebral processes and central autonomic functions. There is
also ample evidence indicating a markedly lowered threshold for
arousal (Key &amp; Bradley, 1960) and an increased sensitivity to
stimuli in all modalities (Klee, 1963). These
psychopharmacological effects parallel the findings of clinical
and behavioral studies at least on the molar descriptive level.
Pronounced perceptual changes have been almost invariably
demonstrated with concomitant alterations in affect, ideation,
and the relationship between subject and environment (Hoffer,
1965). Beyond these rather global findings, results have been
inconsistent and often contradictory, even within species far
less complex than man (Cohen, 1964). </p>

<p> The well-known methodological problems encountered in
research with centrally acting drugs are at least partly
responsible for the slow progress thus far (Zubin &amp; Katz,
1964). This has been especially true with human subjects.
Systematic study of human reactions to LSD poses unique problems
associated with greater organic complexity, shortcomings of
currently available measuring devices, the ubiquity of individual
differences, lack of an adequate theoretical model, and the
influence of non-drug variables such as set and setting. In
addition to these experimental obstacles, LSD has until recently
been the center of a complicated medico-legal-social controversy
(Harman, 1964). This has tended to obscure the relevant empirical
questions and inhibit investigations which are both imaginative
and reasonably objective. </p>

<h5>AMBIVALENCE IN A PERIOD OF TRANSITION</h5>

<p> The short but illustrative history of LSD-25 (a) as a subject
of research, (b) as a psycho- social phenomenon, and (c) as a
theoretical or philosophical enigma may be viewed as a case study
of significant trends in contemporary psychology and psychiatry.
It is equally instructive to reverse the process by viewing the
growing interest and fascination with altered states of
consciousness from the perspective of recent shifts in
psychological theory and research. As young disciplines lacking
stable direction, self-scrutiny and constant revision
characterize the social sciences. And in the light of their
subject-matter, these fields are particularly attuned to the
wider culture. In this connexion, recent developments in the
philosophy and sociology of science emphasize the transactional
interplay between theory, observer, and actuality. Rather than
laws of nature, theory and evidence are more accurately viewed as
working fictions or convenient myths and reflect the belief
system of a given time and place (Holten, et al., 1965). A rather
extreme version of this &quot;Indeterminacy Model&quot; of
science has been described by Alfred de Grazia (1963, p. 56): </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The model suggests that the spirit of the times and
    customs dictate what will and will not be science....
    Scientists operate under the indeterminacy system by various
    myths&#151;primarily of rationality, of causation, and of
    power of choice&#151;but in fact do not know what they are
    seeking, what is available, or what are solutions. That their
    compensation, whether in esteem, position, or money, is
    related to performance is only an illusion. What is accepted
    and what is rejected are therefore only a product of chance
    encounters of purpose and provision. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> A growing body of empirical evidence supports the view that
science as a branch of human endeavor is socially and
psychologically conditioned just as any other human activity
(Rosenthal, 1963). From this perspective, contemporary
theoretical issues and recent shifts in psychological research
become a sensitive barometer of the present social climate and
also a timetable of significant cultural trends. A case in point
is the recent emergence of a &quot;third force&quot; in American
psychology with its emphasis on personal growth and greater
realization of human potentialities. The third force in
psychology has counterparts in each of the arts and science. <a
name="back1"></a><a href="#footnote1">(1)</a> Collectively, they
represent a concerted effort to counteract the progressive
subordination of personal identity to what Erik Erikson calls the
&quot;technological superidentity&quot; (1962). Interestingly,
they also share a highly positive vision of modern man's
foreseeable possibilities. This ambivalent, somewhat paradoxical
position suggests that contemporary humanistic thinking has been
inspired not only by the dehumanizing effects of the
scientific-industrial complex, but also by its capacity for
making the lives of men healthy, safe, and reasonably secure for
the first time in history. </p>

<p> Traditionally, the motive power of western cultures has
necessarily focused on survival and environmental
mastery&#151;human strivings which are highly congenial to a
behavioristic or psychoanalytic frame of reference. In contrast
to these orientations, Maslow views the organismic equilibrium
made possible by satiated bodily needs, physical safety, and some
measure of psychological security as merely prerequisite to more
uniquely human pursuits. This hierarchical conception of man's
strivings depicts him as a self-directed creature with impulses
toward creative expression and self-enhancement as well as
homeostatic maintenance (Maslow, 1962). </p>

<p> It is too early to gauge the extent to which Maslow's
humanistic image of man meshes with the modern temper. On the
other hand, considerable evidence has already accumulated
indicating that behaviorism and psychoanalysis, in their orthodox
forms, no longer have what Bruner describes as &quot;an immediate
resonance with the dialectic of experience&quot; (1962). Yet
their continuing impact on our self- and world-view is clearly
substantial. Thus, three divergent orientations occupy the same
stage concurrently&#151;reflecting and in turn effecting social
values and individual conduct. Viewed comparatively, these
equipotent theories of man and the research they generate give
testimony to the preoccupations and uncertainties of our time. </p>

<p> Placed within this broader context, the diverse descriptions
and interpretations of the LSD experience become more
understandable. And since psychedelic,
&quot;mind-manifesting,&quot; substances have been known and
ingested throughout man's history (Barnard, 1963), the current
fascination with this class of experiences seems particularly
significant. Although presently unclear, one general reason for
the increasing interest in psychedelic phenomena can be
identified: either as a means of investigating higher thought
processes or as a potentially valuable personal experience, the
LSD-induced state is intriguing because it meshes with the
zeitgeist in the social sciences and with major trends in the
larger culture. There is convincing evidence from a variety of
quarters which supports this contention. </p>

<h5>EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY: THE RETURN OF THE OSTRACIZED</h5>

<p> In a recent issue of the <i>American Psychologist,</i> an
incisive paper by a well-known research psychologist is entitled,
&quot;Imagery: The Return of the Ostracized&quot; (Holt, 1964).
After examining the traditional scientific and cultural
resistances to such phenomena as pseudohallucinations, hypnogogic
and dream images, extrasensory perception, and hypnosis, the
author goes on to describe the current status in these fields.
Echoing Hebb's manifesto as president of the American
Psychological Association (1960), he points to a number of recent
breakthroughs in a variety of research areas which signal the
second phase of a psychological revolution. The first phase,
covering the first half of the century, was characterized by the
scientific extremism of psychoanalysis and behaviorism; movements
which purged psychology of the unique and the private. While both
psychoanalysis and behaviorism in their orthodox forms have made
valuable contributions to our understanding of man, it seems
evident now that these orientations can no longer exclude altered
states of consciousness and novel perceptual experiences from the
primary subject-matter of a <i>normal</i> psychology. </p>

<p> Significantly, some of the leading exponents of both theories
such as B. F. Skinner (1963) and H. Hartmann (1958) have
recognized these omissions and indicated a need for revision.
Consistent with theoretical developments, behavioristic research
shows an increasing concern with internal processes including
sensations, images, and cognitions (London &amp; Rosenhan, 1964).
Similarly, psychoanalytic studies focus more on normal or
superior functioning and less on pathology (Frosch &amp; Ross,
1960). These trends are not surprising since some of the most
exciting developments during the past decade have occurred in
experimental work with dream activity, sensory deprivation,
creativity, hypnosis, and the psychedelic drugs. Viewing this
rich array of research activity as occurring within a broader
cultural context, one convergent finding seems of major
significance; namely, that richness of imagination and so-called
regressive experiences are not the exclusive privilege of madmen
and artists. Instead, this work indicates quite conclusively that
under favorable circumstances, most people can greatly expand
their experiential horizons without sacrificing effectiveness in
dealing with conventional reality. </p>

<p> The significant parallels among relatively independent lines
of investigation are most striking. First it should be noted that
each of these phenomenon (psychedelic, dreams, creativity,
sensory isolation, and hypnosis) have traditionally been
associated with the negative, bizarre, and abnormal. Until
recently dreams and hypnosis have generally been linked with
magic and the occult. Similarly, &quot;hallucinogenic&quot; drug
states, sensory confinement, and inordinate creativeness have
strong historical associations with defective character and
insanity. As a result, these classes of experience have typically
been treated as isolated phenomena, discontinuous with other
psychological processes and inexplicable in terms of known
principles. </p>

<p> Although presently accepted as legitimate areas of study, the
tainted heritage of novel experiences has continued to exert
strong influence. For example, recent findings indicate that the
main features of creativity and the necessary conditions for its
development run counter to prevailing ideologies (Getzels &amp;
Jackson, 1962; Gruen, 1964). Similar cultural and professional
resistances have been documented regarding the psychedelic drugs
with particular reference to their presumed
&quot;psychotomimetic&quot; properties (Savage &amp; Stolaroff,
1965). The same biases have been noted in perceptual isolation
research. In their recent critique, Arnhoff and Leon (1964)
conclude that most studies of sensory deprivation effects have
grossly misapplied the concepts and terms of pathology. In much
the same vein, Shor's (1960, p. 162) work on
&quot;hypnotic-like&quot; experiences in normal subjects
indicates that: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In our culture naturally-occurring hypnotic-like
    experiences tend to be regarded with some misgivings if not
    as outright pathology. Consequently they are little talked
    about, but this does not mean that they occur with less
    frequency or profundity than in cultures where they are
    encouraged or institutionalized. In many cultures such
    experiences are seen as a vital source of creative
    inspiration and gratification. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> A second significant parallel concerns the remarkable
subjective and behavioral similarities of these experiences.
Consistent findings in research on hypnotic, psychedelic, and
dream states, certain phases of the creative process, as well as
sensory and dream deprivation indicate an almost complete overlap
of major effects. Reported communalities include significant
alterations in perception, dominance of sensation and imagery
over verbal-associative thinking, relaxed ego boundaries, changes
in bodily feelings, and the suspension of conventional
reality&#151;orientation to space, time, and self. </p>

<p> Theoretical accounts of these psychological changes have also
run parallel. Whether self-induced or situationally induced by
means of fatigue, drugs, or some form of stress, such states have
typically been viewed as regressive, infantile, or primitive,
indicating sudden loss of ego control and the eruption of
unconscious forces. Until very recently, the effects have been
interpreted as disturbing, incapacitating, quasipsychotic,
dissociative, or depersonalizing. Consistent with these
interpretations, persons prone to altered states of awareness
have generally been described as poorly adjusted, suggestible,
irrational, passive, and low in ego strength. <a name="back2"></a><a
href="#footnote2">(2)</a> </p>

<p> Perhaps the most important parallel concerns the current
status and direction of research in these areas. At the present
time, work in each area reveals a discernible shift away from
investigating the condition or phenomenon per se, focusing
instead on the situation- and subject-determined variables. This
significant turning point calls attention to the key importance
of the psycho-social context in which these experiences are
inextricably embedded. Related to this new research strategy,
recent findings and shifts in theorizing about altered states of
consciousness have taken a more positive turn. </p>

<p> As a case in point, the aftereffects of dream deprivation,
both positive and negative, vary widely across subjects. Dement
(1960) found that &quot;the kinds of alterations represent
extensions or revelations of tendencies native to the individual
personality&quot; and that their form, degree, and dynamic
meaning were influenced by the setting and by interpersonal
transactions. With regard to hypnotic susceptibility, Barber
(1964) has established the central importance of attitudinal and
motivational variables. Similarly, recent findings indicate that
the nature and intensity of hypnotic experiences are strongly
influenced by the sociopsychological milieu, particularly the
mutual expectancies of subject and experimenter (Sarbin &amp;
Lim, 1963). </p>

<p> The same trends are found in sensory deprivation research.
Considerable evidence has accumulated indicating that greatly
reduced sensory input can impair or facilitate mental functioning
depending on the particular interaction of set, setting, and
personality (Brownfield, 1964). For example, Leiderman (1964)
found that &quot;with the element of fear removed, the imagery of
sensory deprivation becomes like the imagery of daydreams, quite
familiar and usually not anxiety-producing.&quot; Interestingly,
sensory deprivation is reportedly therapeutic for some patients
(Zuckerman, 1964). The direction of thinking in this area is
perhaps best summed up by Suedfeld (1964). Noting that some
experimentally isolated subjects reveal striking creativity in
solving problems, he poses the question, &quot;What would happen
if creative behavior were externally reinforced by the
experimenter?&quot; </p>

<p> Turning to the psychedelics, it has become apparent that
adverse psychological or behavioral effects are not
drug-specific. More generally, the nature, intensity, and content
of the experience are the result of complex transactions between
the subject's past history and personality, the set and
expectancies of both subject and administrator, and the physical
and psychological setting in which the experience takes place
(see e.g., Unger, 1964a). As in the case of related phenomena,
most of these determinants of response to LSD can be
intentionally arranged and manipulated so as to foster either a
propitious or a stressful experience. In the search for
relatively invariant or &quot;drug-specific&quot; reactions much
of the research until recently has failed to assess, control, or
systematically vary relevant non-drug variables. </p>

<p> Laboratory studies of behavioral effects during the
LSD-induced state have been particularly insensitive to
situation- and subject-determined variables. Changes in
performance levels on a wide variety of tasks have been
extensively investigated with inconclusive results. Instrumental
learning has been found to be impaired (Krus et al., 1963),
enhanced (Rosenbaum et al., 1959), and unchanged (Kornetsky,
1957). Both impairment and enhancement of color perception have
been reported (Wapner &amp; Krus, 1960; Hartman &amp; Hollister,
1963). Similarly, studies of the effects of LSD on recall and
recognition, discrimination learning, concentration, symbolic
thinking, and perceptual accuracy have yielded contradictory
results (see e.g., Trouton &amp; Eyesenck, 1961). It is perhaps
significant that most of the laboratory research has used the
drug as a stressor with the intention of simulating
psychotic-like performance-impairment (psychotomimetic
orientation). In contrast, well over three hundred clinical
studies on the therapeutic effectiveness of LSD have reported
almost uniformly positive results (Hoffer, 1965; Mogar, 1965a).
This more recent line of investigation views the drug as a
liberator which facilitates accurate perception, self-insight,
and performance-enhancement (psychedelic orientation). Consistent
with their objectives and positive findings, clinical studies
have generally (a) optimized the context of the drug experience
and (b) been particularly attentive to individual differences in
personality and set. </p>

<p> A number of studies have demonstrated that personality
differences are as important as preparation and setting in
determining response to LSD. In a study of immediate and
long-term effects of the psychedelic experience, Mogar and Savage
(1964) found that post-LSD changes were related to personality
styles and modal defense patterns. The results indicated that
subjects with a well-defined but flexible self structure
responded most favorably to the drug, while those with either
under-developed or overly-rigid ego defenses responded less
favorably. Similar differential findings have been obtained
recently in work with sensory deprivation and hypnosis. For
example, both neuroticism and &quot;field-dependence&quot;
correlate significantly with disturbing, stressful reactions to
sensory deprivation (Zuckerman &amp; Cohen, 1964). Other
isolation studies have found positive relationships between
&quot;field-independence&quot; and performance-enhancement
(Brownfield, 1964), and between &quot;self-actualizing
maturity&quot; and enjoyment of sensory deprivation (Blazer,
1963). Particularly relevant to the psychedelics is the finding
that positive visual imagery during isolation correlates highly
with (a) intellectual flexibility, breadth, and richness, (b)
acceptance of one's passive, feminine side, and (c) freedom from
emotional disturbance and constriction (Holt &amp; Goldberger,
1961). </p>

<p> Comparable results in research on individual differences in
hypnotic susceptibility have seriously undermined long-standing
interpretations. Specifically, a host of studies recently found
that hypnotic susceptibility was negatively correlated with
neuroticism and placebo-responsiveness, and positively correlated
with emotional stability (Bentler et al., 1963; Lang &amp;
Lazovik, 1962). Although generally unrelated to specific
personality attributes in normal subjects, independent work by
Shor et al. (1962) and As (1963) indicate a consistently high
relationship between hypnotizability and the frequency of <i>naturally
occurring</i> altered states, particularly ecstatic and peak
experiences. The range of personal history experiences
inventoried in these studies were characterized by constructive
use of regression, tolerance for logical paradoxes, willingness
to relinquish ego control, and the ability to suspend disbelief
or adopt an &quot;as if&quot; attitude. It is worth noting that
these correlates of hypnotic susceptibility are also associated
with propitious psychedelic states, certain aspects of
creativity, and self-actualization. <a name="back3"></a><a
href="#footnote3">(3)</a> </p>

<p> Current findings and theorizing in the various areas
considered here can be summarized briefly.. Whether self-induced,
stress-induced, or drug-induced, altered states of consciousness
will be welcomed and valuable rather than feared and harmful to
the degree that the sociopsychological demands of such
experiences are congenial to the &quot;kinetic&quot; needs and
values of a given individual. Based on an analysis of imagery in
Rorschach responses, Holt and Havel (1960, p.311) reach a similar
conclusion: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We find primary process thinking in conscious subjects
    either out of strength or out of weakness. In the former
    case, it is more likely to appear in a playful or esthetic
    frame of reference, accompanied by pleasant affect. If, on
    the other hand, primary thinking breaks through the usual
    defenses uninvited and unwanted, the subject may feel anxious
    or threatened and is likely to act defensively. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> This view is consistent with recent developments in
personality theory, particularly the current emphasis on latent
creative potential and self-actualizing tendencies.
Representative of this trend, the opposing dualisms in
psychoanalytic theory have undergone major revision so as to
include regression in the service of the ego and creative fusions
of primary and secondary process thinking (Hilgard, 1962). In a
similar vein, Maddi (1963, p. 193) refers to the id as &quot;the
breeding ground of love and worship, as well as of the novel
imaginations which are eventually applauded, instituted, and
cherished by society.&quot; Stated simply, recent theoretical
innovations recognize that greater access to unconscious
resources is a cardinal feature of psychedelic, creative, and
other novel perceptual experiences, as well as psychosis. And
that in contrast to hallucinatory states, creative or revelatory
experiences involve a <i>temporary</i> and <i>voluntary</i>
breaking up of perceptual constancies, permitting one &quot;to
shake free from dead literalism, to re-combine the old familiar
elements into new, imaginative, amusing, or beautiful
patterns&quot; (Holt &amp; Havel, 1960, p. 304). </p>

<h5>PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCES AND CONTEMPORARY PSYCHOTHERAPY</h5>

<p> Consistent with the scene in experimental psychology, a
similar trend away from viewing psychedelic phenomena as
undesirable or pathological is also apparent in clinical
psychology and psychiatry. A growing recognition of the potential
value of psychedelic experiences is especially discernible in
contemporary psychotherapy. Recent theorizing in psychotherapy
reveals an increasing awareness of the restraints imposed by
conventional modes of thought and perception. As suggested
earlier, current developments in psychoanalytic theory correct
the previous over- emphasis on maintaining impulse-control and a
sharp distinction between self and non-self. Instead, present
formulations recognize the relative flatness of consensual
reality as well as the creative potential of novel thoughts and
impulses. Representative of this trend, the conditions of mental
health proposed by Heinz Hartmann (1958) include the ability to
&quot;deautomatize&quot; stereotyped perceptions and the ability
to maintain fluid subject-object boundaries. It is noteworthy
that similar attributes have been found to characterize highly
self-actualized persons. More significantly, a number of studies
have found that novel states of awareness including loss of
distinction between self and non-self, transcendental or peak
experiences, and oceanic feeling states are fairly common in the
normal college population (As, 1962b; Shor, 1960). Furthermore,
there has been a greater willingness in recent years to
acknowledge and report such experiences without apology or
embarrassment. </p>

<p> These conceptual revisions and empirical findings also call
attention to the well-documented shortcomings of orthodox
therapies and the critical need for more effective techniques. In
a recent critique of the status of psychotherapy, Colby (1964)
concludes that our current paradigms have demonstrably failed and
urges a major transition from ordinary to extraordinary
innovation. Certainly many therapists readily acknowledge what
Colby calls an impending crisis. However, Astin (196I) notes that
&quot;the principle of functional autonomy will permit
psychotherapy to survive long after it has outlived its
usefulness.&quot; A similar view is expressed by Korn (1964,p.38)
after examining previous reactions to new methods of treating
psychopathology. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is notorious that virtually no nostrum has ever been
    abandoned merely because it failed to work. The old method
    had always to be overthrown by the new&#151;and it is also
    notorious that the practitioners of the traditional way will
    attempt to prevent even the first trial of the method on the
    strange grounds that it has never been tried and
    proven&#151;a criterion not applied in their own case. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Despite the reluctance to abandon the old and embrace the
new, disillusionment with traditional techniques finds expression
in the current upsurge of interest among therapists of <i>all </i>persuasions
in Zen Buddhism (Maupin, 1962), existentialism (Lyons, 1961), and
transcendental or peak experiences (Maslow, 1962). Also
indicative of present developments is the host of studies
establishing personal and cultural belief systems as key
variables in psychotherapy. The representative work of
Hollingshead and Redlich (1958) demonstrated a significant
relationship between social class, incidence and type of mental
illness, and the form of treatment received. The relationships
found were remarkably consistent with middle-class American
values. Numerous studies have indicated that improvement in
therapy involves a basic change in the patient's core belief
system, that therapists' values influence both the process and
outcome of therapy, and that in &quot;successful&quot; outcomes,
the patient's value orientation changes in the direction of the
therapist's (see, e.g., London, 1964; Schofield, 1964). </p>

<p> These trends are relevant to what is perhaps the major issue
in psychotherapy today, namely, the search for positive criteria
of mental health or personal growth which are explicitly based on
humanistic values. It is now generally recognized that
psychological health or self fulfillment involves more than the
absence of illness or emotional disturbance. These developments
in mental health concepts have paralleled the recent discovery
that most recipients of psychotherapy are not suffering from the
traditional forms of neurosis and character disorder. While
certainly self-dissatisfied and unfulfilled, the person seeking
therapy today is generally not unproductive, ineffective, or
crippled with neurotic symptoms. Many writers have described the
typical therapy patient as one who is relatively free of physical
complaints, neurotic anxiety and depression, failures of
achievement, and interpersonal conflicts (Strupp, 1963). In
short, the hallmarks of emotional disorder are conspicuously
absent. Rather, the central struggle for an increasing number of
successful and relatively well-adjusted people seems to be
&quot;a loss of meaning in life, an absence of purpose, or a
failure of faith&quot; (Schofield, 1964). Modern discontent tends
to take the form of alienation. In William Barrett's terms,
alienation from God, from nature, from the human community, and
ultimately, alienation from self (1958). While recognizing that
the person with problems in personal identity and life outlook
deserves help, some investigators have concluded that the
psychotherapist is ill-equipped for such a priestly task
(Wheelis, 1958). This belief is somewhat substantiated by the
disappointment which many patients of this type experience in
psychotherapy. Yet a dearth of alternative resources seem open to
the person in this predicament. </p>

<p> In the light then of what seems to be an incompatibility
between psychotherapy, as traditionally conceived, on the one
hand, and the nature of modern discontent, on the other, it is
certainly less than a coincidence that many people who fit this
description express an interest in the psychedelic experience and
find their way to LSD. It should perhaps be emphasized that the
only sentiment these people share with the stereotyped beatnik is
a sense of alienation from traditional values. </p>

<p> The attitudes and reactions to LSD, both positive and
negative, become more understandable when viewed against this
background of present-day trends in psychology and psychiatry.
Within this broader context, it is not surprising that the major
application of LSD today is to treat mental illness rather than <i>produce</i>
it. Beyond this shift in emphasis, the use of LSD for therapeutic
purposes clearly reflects the ambivalence among therapists toward
the ever-growing number of meaning- and identity-seekers who
request their services. The research and clinical literature
concerning LSD as a therapeutic agent reveals two major
viewpoints which seem representative of this ambivalence. These
two orientations are associated with greatly dissimilar methods
of administration. One emphasizes the use of LSD periodically and
in small doses as an adjunct to traditional techniques of
psychotherapy (Crockett et al., 1963). The other major approach
employs LSD in a single, large dose, producing an intense and
prolonged psychedelic experience. Applied in this manner, LSD
serves as a catalyst for inducing rapid and profound changes in
the subject's value-belief system and in his self-image (Sherwood
et al., 1962). While recognizing the therapeutic benefits of LSD,
this latter technique places greater emphasis on its more unique
potentialities and value, namely, as a means of facilitating
personal growth and self-actualization. Rather than freedom from
emotional symptoms, the primary objective of the psychedelic
experience becomes a major reorganization of one's beliefs and
life outlook. In short, the first method is essentially
illness-oriented, the second, health or growth-oriented. </p>

<p> When employed as an adjunct to psychotherapy, most
investigators have associated the beneficial effects of LSD with
reduced defensiveness, the reliving of early childhood
experiences, increased access to unconscious material, and
greater emotional expression. In contrast, when used as a primary
vehicle for rapid personality change, emphasis is usually placed
on the transcendental quality of the experience, the resynthesis
of basic values and beliefs, and major changes in the
relationship between self and environment. </p>

<p> With regard to effectiveness, both orientations have reported
impressive results. Since over three hundred studies have been
reported, only the most salient and consistent findings will be
summarized. <a name="back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">(4)</a>
Despite great diversity in the conduct of these studies, high
improvement rates have been almost uniformly reported, with both
adults and children, and in group as well as individual
psychotherapy. Used either as an adjunct or as a primary
treatment method, LSD has been found to facilitate improvement in
patients covering the complete spectrum of neurotic,
psychosomatic, and character disorders. Particularly noteworthy
are the positive results obtained with cases highly resistant to
conventional forms of therapy. High remission rates among
alcoholics, for example, have frequently been reported following
a single, large dose LSD session. Based on their findings with
over one thousand alcoholics, Hoffer and his co-workers concluded
that LSD was twice as effective as any other treatment program
(1965). Other chronic conditions carrying a poor prognosis which
have responded favorably to psychedelic therapy include sexual
deviations, criminal psychopathy, autism in children, and
adolescent behavior disorders. </p>

<p> Since most reports have been based on clinical judgments of
unknown reliability, it is worth noting that comparable results
have been obtained by investigators in many other countries.
Furthermore, Freudian therapists, Jungians, behaviorists,
existentialists, and a variety of eclectic therapists have
reported positive findings with LSD. It seems safe to conclude
from the breadth and consistency of the clinical evidence that
LSD can produce far-reaching beneficial effects in some people,
under some conditions. However, controlled studies of the process
variables involved have yet to be conducted. Specifically, in
what particular ways do various kinds of people respond to LSD,
both during the experience and afterward? What are the optimal
conditions of preparation, administration, and follow-up for
given objectives, and for given subjects? How can we account for
the various kinds and extent of change which follow an LSD
experience? In short, despite the mass of accumulated data on the
<i>outcome</i> of psychedelic therapy, relationships among <i>process</i>
variables remain obscure. </p>

<p> Primarily because of the controversy surrounding these
chemical agents (which interestingly is confined to the United
States), controlled research aimed at maximizing their safety,
their effectiveness, and their human value has barely begun. In
addition to questions concerning the possible uses of LSD as a
therapeutic or educative device, its potential value as a basic
research tool for investigating higher mental processes has also
been minimally explored. Although clinical evidence and
testimonial reports indicate that LSD promises to be a valuable
tool for both the study and enhancement of cognitive and
perceptual functioning, such claims have been neither supported
nor refuted by means of controlled studies. Other hypotheses
readily testable include the suggested similarities noted earlier
between psychedelic, hypnotic, and dream states, the
inspirational phase of creativity, as well as sensory and dream
deprivation experiences. </p>

<h5>PSYCHEDELIC, NADIR, AND PEAK EXPERIENCES</h5>

<p> The nature, extent, and duration of effects both during and
subsequent to the LSD- induced state has been a major focus of
study in the psychedelic research program conducted at the
International Foundation for Advanced Study, Menlo Park,
California. Over a three-year period, extensive assessments were
obtained on almost four hundred subjects before, during, and at
various points following a psychedelic experience. Each subject
underwent a single, large dose LSD session conducted in a
comfortable, aesthetically pleasing setting. Although trained
staff members were present throughout the session day, primarily
for emotional support and human contact, no attempt was made to
direct or interpret the experience. Rather, the subject was urged
to explore himself and his universe without external guidance or
intrusion. Prior to the LSD experience, each subject was given a
physical and psychiatric examination followed by a series of
preparatory interviews. These interviews were designed to help
the individual examine or reexamine his reasons for taking LSD,
to clarify whatever problems or questions he wished to explore,
and to become accustomed extensive follow-up evaluations were
made covering a minimum of six months. </p>

<p> The design of this research program was based on the
assumption that significant changes would occur along three major
dimensions; values and beliefs, personality, and actual behavior
in major life areas. More specifically, it was hypothesized that
a profound psychedelic experience tends to be followed by a major
reorientation of one's value system and life outlook. It was
further hypothesized that this change in basic beliefs would in
terms be followed by <i>slower </i>alterations in personality as
well as changes in modal behavior patterns. </p>

<p> The findings so far provide considerable support for the
general hypothesis concerning parallel changes in values,
personality, and behavior (Mogar and Savage, 1964; Savage et al.,
1965a; Savage et al., 1965b). Three days following the LSD
session, a consistent and reliable increase was found in the
extent to which an individual agrees with test items reflecting a
deep sense of meaning and purpose in life, open-mindedness,
greater aesthetic sensitivity, and sense of unity or oneness with
nature and humanity. Decreases were found on values pertaining to
material possessions, social status, and dogmatism. Also
significant was the finding that changes in personal beliefs
either remained constant or became still more prominent at later
follow-ups. These were consistent results cutting across such
factors as age, sex, religious orientation, or personality type.
Thus, it seems safe to conclude that a rapid and extensive change
in values does tend to occur in most subjects, and importantly,
is maintained over time. </p>

<p> The additional hypothesis that slower modifications in
personality and behavior would occur has also received
considerable support. For example, the data show that if a person
values human brotherhood more after his psychedelic experience,
his personality and behavior reflect this new conviction. He
tends to be less distrustful and guarded with others, warmer and
more spontaneous in expressing emotion, and less prone to
feelings of personal inadequacy. With regard to modal behavior
patterns, parallel changes tend to occur in such areas as marital
relations and work effectiveness (Savage et al., 1965a). </p>

<p> Although the overall results indicate that almost all
subjects derived some degree of benefit along the lines
hypothesized, it is important to emphasize that the nature,
extent, and the stability of changes varied considerably.
Specific sources or correlates of this variability included
pre-LSD personality structure, the type of presenting problem,
and variations in the psychedelic experience itself. With regard
to pre-LSD individual differences, subgroups were objectively
defined according to (a) personality structure (anxiety
neurotics, borderline psychotics, nonconforming normals,
manic-impulsives, and normal depressives), and (b) major defense
pattern (hysterical, intellectual-compulsive). Despite the
brevity of the LSD program, all subgroups displayed positive
personality changes at two and six months following the
psychedelic experience. The nature and extent of improvement
compared most favorably with longer-term orthodox therapies
(Mogar &amp; Savage, 1964). </p>

<p> Although each subgroup maintained significant improvement,
subjects varied considerably in their capacity to translate
profound insights into attitudes, feelings, and conduct.
Individual differences were particularly apparent at six months
since by this time a leveling off had generally occurred, that
is, most subjects had in large part come to terms with their
rapidly altered self-world image. For six months habitual
patterns of response to situations had been scrutinized and
repeatedly challenged. Dissonance between thought, feeling, and
action had generally been reconciled and a higher level of
integration achieved At six months some individuals maintained
and consolidated the gains demonstrated at two months
(Nonconforming Normals, Manic-Impulsives, Normal Depressives).
Others displayed further personal growth which was still in
progress (Anxiety Neurotics, Intellectual-Compulsives). Still
others showed a tendency to regress from the level of improvement
indicated at two months (Borderline Psychotics, Hysterics). In
these subjects, either the pull of well-entrenched maladaptive
defenses and/or an uncongenial life environment undermined to
some extent the favorable personality alterations demonstrated
earlier. </p>

<p> With regard to the nature of changes characterizing different
personality types, shifts tended to occur consistent with the
symptoms and defense pattern of a given group. Anxiety neurotics
were less anxious, compulsive, and withdrawn while close
relationships were more gratifying. In contrast, impulsive,
hyperactive subjects led a more orderly, less hectic existence
and displayed greater impulse control. </p>

<p> The &quot;illness-oriented&quot; nature of these findings
reflects the fact that two-thirds of the total sample resembled
the typical case load of an outpatient psychiatric clinic. The
remaining one-third did not present complaints of a psychiatric
nature and revealed minimal emotional disturbance according to
both diagnostic evaluation and psychological test data. Instead,
the interest expressed by these subjects seemed to be
&quot;growth-motivated&quot; rather than
&quot;deficiency-motivated.&quot; Some were dimly aware of
potentialities which they hoped to activate and develop more
fully. Others expressed a feeling of emptiness and lack of
meaningful purpose while adequately meeting the exigencies of
life. Still others sought a deeper understanding or more
satisfying resolutions to problems of an existential nature. </p>

<p> As a result of their stable life circumstances and relative
freedom from neurotic disturbance, these subjects were more
likely to grapple with ultimate problems during the LSD
experience. In addition to self-identity and personal worth,
questions of love, death, creation and rebirth, and the
resolution of life paradoxes received frequent attention. Unlike
the neurotic group, childhood memories, intrapsychic conflicts,
and specific interpersonal relations were explored minimally.
Accounts of the experience written shortly afterward revealed
that healthier subjects were less likely to view the psychedelic
state as fantastic or totally dissimilar from previous
experience. These personal reports together with clinical
evaluations and ratings also indicated that this group benefited
considerably from the psychedelic experience along the lines of
self-actualization, richer creative experience, and enhancement
of specific aptitudes and talents. At the present time, these
tentative findings are being investigated more objectively with
measures appropriate for a normal sample. Thus it will be
possible to compare individuals, differing in personality and
presenting problems, with regard to health-growth dimensions as
well as decreases in pathology. </p>

<p> Since most subjects in this series of studies were college
trained and psychologically sophisticated, it is noteworthy that
the frequency of occurrence of transcendental-like experiences is
apparently as great in &quot;naive&quot; prisoners and alcoholics
(Unger, 1964a). Such communalities are not surprising in view of
the key role placed by universal and personal symbolism in
psychedelic experiences and the relatively weak role of the
conscious self (including verbal facility, accumulated knowledge,
and intelligence). What seems to be affected by
subject-differences is the content of the experience, rather than
its <i>form,</i> <i>intensity</i>, or <i>profundity.</i> </p>

<p> Differences in the thematic content of the experience were
found among subjects with diverse cultural backgrounds. For
example, wide individual differences were demonstrated with
respect to content in the frequent experience of unity. However,
the fact that the majority of subjects experienced a sense of
unity or oneness seems far more significant than whether the
unity was felt with self, nature, the universe, God, or some
combination of these. This is merely another way of saying that
to the degree an individual can verbalize the experience, he will
draw on his own particular semantic framework and belief system.
One can only speculate on the discrepancy between this
communicated account of the experience and the experience itself.
</p>

<p> These findings suggest that the profundity or intensity of a
psychedelic experience is more crucially related to subsequent
change than thematic content. More specifically, the hypothesis
currently being tested is that subsequent transformations in
values, personality, and conduct are a function of the
experience's intensity, either positive or negative-or both. In
other words, painful experiences can be as personally revealing
and permanently beneficial as experiences of great joy and
beauty. </p>

<p> The hypothesis that a profound and intense psychedelic
experience, regardless of its emotional valence, can serve as a
catalyst for rapid personal growth is consistent with current
interpretations of both nadir and peak experiences. Concerning
nadir experiences, Erikson's brilliant analysis of the
post-adolescent identity crisis (1959) has recently been extended
to include periodic &quot;crisis of maturation&quot; (Kahn,
1963), naturally occurring &quot;desolation experiences&quot;
(Laski, 1961), and the therapeutic value of &quot;existential
crises&quot; (Bugental, 1965). In each case, these writers
emphasize that although negative and painful, a personal crisis
is: (a) not pathological, (b) a critical choice point in life
necessitating a &quot;leap of faith,&quot; (c) an essential
condition of growth and psychological change, and (d) often a
catalyst for an emerging inner conviction or new awareness. The
potential value of nadir experiences has been well-stated by
Forer (1963, p.280): &quot;Crisis as a psychological experience
is a part of any creative effort, scientific, artistic,
therapeutic, or inter-personal.&quot; </p>

<p> With regard to positive revelatory experiences, Maslow
recently developed the thesis that experiences referred to as
religious, mystical, or transcendental actually denote special
cases of the more generic &quot;core-religious&quot; or peak
experience, described as the hallmark of highly self- actualized
people (Maslow, 1964). Similarly, the extensive research on
creativity by MacKinnon and his associates indicates that the
truly creative person is distinguished from the noncreative
individual by his capacity for &quot;transliminal
experience&quot; (MacKinnon, 1964). Following Harold Rugg's study
of creative imagination, the transliminal experience is
characterized by an illuminating flash of insight occurring at a
critical threshold of the conscious-unconscious continuum.
MacKinnon's description of the transliminal experience bears a
striking resemblance to the more inclusive peak experience.
Interestingly, Maslow (1964) suggests that psychedelic drugs may
offer a means of producing a controlled peak experience under
observation, particularly in &quot;non-peakers.&quot; </p>

<p> Although tentative at this point, these lines of
investigation seem highly significant and certainly suggestive of
future directions in LSD research. And if the historical
perspective described earlier is relatively accurate, the
exploration of ways of expanding human consciousness will soon
occupy a prominent position in the mainstream of contemporary
psychology. Should this prediction materialize, we can look
forward to a far more extensive application of these powerful
agents as a means of facilitating social as well as individual
potentialities. For the present, research with the psychedelics
will continue to seek those conditions which maximize their
safety, their effectiveness, and their human value.</p>

<h3>MESCALINE, PSILOCYBIN, AND CREATIVE ARTISTS</h3>

<h5>Stanley Krippner</h5>

<p> an excerpt from &quot;The Psychedelic State, The Hypnotic
Trance, and the Creative Act,&quot; a paper published in <i>Altered
States of Consciousness,</i> edited by Charles T. Tart, copyright
1969, 1972 by John Wiley &amp; Sons.</p>

<hr>

<p> A number of creative people claim to have benefited from
psychotherapy which utilized psychedelic drugs. Actor Cary Grant
attributed &quot;a new assessment of life&quot; to LSD (Gaines,
1963). Blues singer Ronnie Gilbert, in 1964, was mired in a deep
depressive state from which she found it impossible to break
free. In desperation, she entered LSD therapy and, during the
following six months, went through 20 psychedelic sessions.
Frequently, Miss Gilbert and her psychiatrist went for walks in
the park or visited art galleries and churches. </p>

<p> During one stroll through the park, Miss Gilbert felt a
&quot;sense of life all around me; I looked at trees for the
first time, really looked at them.&quot; She recalled that
&quot;everything seemed so rich and so intense.&quot; This
spontaneous experience (which was not chemically induced)
hastened her progress and therapy soon terminated. Several years
later she remarked, &quot;I've been turned on to life and have
never been so happy.&quot; </p>

<p> Miss Gilbert's psychiatrist commented. &quot;Ronnie was
lucky. She was one of the people who have been able to work
through lifelong problems in a few sessions, and there is no
reason why the good results shouldn't stick. Not everybody gets
as much out of the experience. She was also lucky because she
came into therapy before federal restrictions clamped down on
it&quot; (Gaines, 1963). </p>

<p> Only five major research projects in the area of psychedelic
drugs and creative performance have been reported and most of
these have been described by the experimenters as &quot;pilot
studies&quot; rather than full-scale experiments with conclusive
results. L.M. Berlin et al., (1955) investigated the effects of
mescaline and LSD upon four graphic artists of national
prominence. There was an impairment of finger-tapping efficiency
and muscular steadiness among the four artists, but all were able
to complete paintings. A panel of art critics judged the
paintings as having &quot;greater aesthetic value&quot; than the
artists' usual work, noting that the lines were bolder and that
the use of color was more vivid. However, the technical execution
was somewhat impaired. </p>

<p> The artists themselves spoke of an increased richness of
imagery and of pleasurable sensory experiences. One said, &quot;I
looked out of the window into the infinitely splendid universe of
a tiny mauve leaf performing a cosmic ballet.&quot; Another spoke
of &quot;light falling on light.&quot; </p>

<p> Frank Barron (1963) administered psilocybin to a number of
highly creative individuals and recorded their impressions. One
of Barron's subjects stated, &quot;I felt a communion with all
things.&quot; A composer wrote, &quot;Every corner is alive in a
silent intimacy.&quot; Barron concluded, &quot;What psilocybin
does is to . . . dissolve many definitions and . . . melt many
boundaries, permit greater intensities or more extreme values of
experience to occur in many dimensions.&quot; </p>

<p> Some of Barron's artists, however, were wildly enthusiastic
about their apparently increased sensitivity during the drug
experience only to discover, once the effects wore off, that the
production was without artistic merit. One painter recalled,
&quot;I have seldom known such absolute identification with what
I was doing&#151;nor such a lack of concern with it
afterwards.&quot; This statement indicates that an artist is not
necessarily able to judge the value of his psychedelically
inspired work while he is under drug influence. </p>

<p> McGlothlin, Cohen, and McGlothlin (1967) made an intensive
study of 72 volunteer graduate students following a preliminary
study (1964) which involved 15 subjects. (In the preliminary
study, no significant changes in creativity were noted following
a 200 microgram LSD session; a number of creativity tests were
given before the session and one week after the session. However,
some significant changes were reported on anxiety and attitude
tests.) </p>

<p> A large battery of psychological tests was administered prior
to a series of three 200 microgram LSD sessions, and again at
intervals of two weeks and six months following the third
session. Among the tests in the battery were three art scales, a
measure of artistic performance, a test of imaginativeness, a
test of originality, four tests of divergent thinking, and a test
of remote associations. </p>

<p> Three groups were created: an experimental group receiving
200 micrograms of LSD per session, a control group receiving 25
micrograms of LSD per session, and another control group
receiving 20 milligrams of an amphetamine per session. As there
were no systematic differences between the two control groups at
the end of the study, they were combined for purposes of
comparison with the experimental group. </p>

<p> The most frequently reported change in the experimental group
on a questionnaire filled out after six months was &quot;a
greater appreciation of music&quot;; 62 per cent of the subjects
made this assertion. The increase in number of records bought,
time spent in museums, and number of musical events attended in
the post-drug period was significantly greater for the
experimental group. However, the subjects' scores on the art
tests did not show a significant increase; the authors concluded
that the data &quot;do not indicate that the increase in
aesthetic appreciation and activities is accompanied by an
increase in sensitivity and performance.&quot; </p>

<p> On the questionnaire filled out after six months, 25 per cent
of experimental Subjects felt that LSD experience had resulted in
enhanced creativity in their work. However, the creativity tests
showed no evidence to substantiate this subjective report for the
experimental group as a whole or for those claiming greater
creative ability. </p>

<p> The other tests in the battery produced provocative results
in regard to personality variables and the taking of LSD. The
authors reported that &quot;persons who place strong emphasis on
structure and control generally have no taste for the experience
and tend to respond minimally if exposed. Those who respond
intensely tend to prefer a more unstructured, spontaneous,
inward-turning (though not socially introverted) life, and score
somewhat higher on tests of aesthetic sensitivity and
imaginativeness. They also tend to be less aggressive,
competitive, and conforming.&quot; </p>

<p> On the one measure of artistic performance used (the
Draw-A-Person Test), the LSD subjects showed a significant
decrease after six months. </p>

<p> Zegans, Pollard, and Brown (1967) investigated the effects of
LSD upon creativity test scores of 30 male subjects chosen from a
group of volunteer graduate students. Upon arrival, the first
battery of tests was given and certain physiological measures
(blood pressure and pulse rate) were taken. A dose of LSD equal
to 0.5 micrograms per kilogram body weight was added to the water
of 19 subjects randomly selected to receive the drug; the other 1
l subjects did not receive LSD. After ingestion (of the drug),
the subject was escorted to a lounge where he relaxed for two
hours. Immediately prior to the second half of the test battery
(which consisted of alternate forms of the same tests previously
given), the physiological measures were repeated. The battery of
tests included a measure of remote association, a test of
originality for word associations, a test for ability to create
an original design from tiles, a free association test, and a
measure involving the ability to perceive hidden figures in a
complicated line drawing. A tachistoscopic stimulation task was
also included; this determined speed of visual perception. </p>

<p> When the creativity test data were investigated, it was
discovered that the LSD group did significantly better than the
control group on the re-test for originality of word associations
(a modified form of the Rapaport Word Association Test). Although
most other comparisons favored the LSD group, no other results
were statistically significant. The authors concluded that
&quot;the administration of LSD-25 to a relatively unselected
group of people for the purpose of enhancing their creative
ability is not likely to be successful.&quot; </p>

<p> A further analysis of the data demonstrated that the authors
were able to predict physiological reactions to a significant
degree of accuracy on the basis of previously administered
personality tests. It was also noted that the LSD subjects
(although doing significantly better than control subjects on the
word association test) made their poorest showing on those tests
requiring visual attention (e.g., the tachistoscopic task, the
tile design test, the hidden figures test). It was suggested that
LSD &quot;may increase the accessibility of remote or unique
ideas and associations&quot; while making it difficult for a
subject to narrow his attention upon a delimited perceptual
field. As a result &quot;greater openness to remote or unique
ideas and associations would only be likely to enhance creative
thought in those individuals who were meaningfully engaged in
some specific interest or problem.&quot; </p>

<p> The Institute of Psychedelic Research of San Francisco State
College employed mescaline in an attempt to facilitate the
creative process (Fadiman et al., 1965; Harman et al., 1966). The
subjects were professional workers in various fields, who were
instructed to bring a professional problem requiring a creative
solution to their sessions. A number of them had worked for weeks
or months on their chosen problems without success. After some
psychological preparation, subjects worked individually on their
problem throughout their single mescaline session. Virtually all
subjects produced solutions judged highly creative and
satisfactory by practical standards. </p>

<p> Two of the five cited studies suggest that unselected
graduate students cannot expect an increase in creative ability
as a result of their participation in an LSD experiment. On the
other hand, creative workers in three studies utilizing
psychedelic drugs showed an enhancement of creative functioning.
The results must be regarded as tentative until additional work
has been done in this field and until a greater control is
exerted over the many variables present. <a name="back"></a><a

<p></p>

<h5>NINETY-ONE ARTISTS</h5>

<p> During 1967, in an attempt to discover the types of
psychedelic drugs being used illegally by artists, as well as the
subjective opinions of the users, Krippner (1967) surveyed 9l
artists who were reputed to have had one or more
&quot;psychedelic experiences.&quot; Among the 91 were an
award-winning film-maker, a Guggenheim Fellow in poetry, and a
recipient of Ford, Fulbright, and Rockefeller study grants in
painting. </p>

<p> A remarkably large number of the artists surveyed (93 per
cent) agreed with a broad definition of the &quot;psychedelic
artist&quot; and 8I per cent felt that the term could be applied
to them personally. It was concluded that the &quot;psychedelic
artist&quot; is one whose work shows the effects of psychedelic
experience&#151;usually, but not necessarily, chemically induced.
The work may have been produced as a result of psychedelic
experience, during psychedelic experience, or in attempt to
induce a psychedelic experience. In addition, the work may remind
someone of a previous psychedelic experience or it may be used to
facilitate psychedelic experience brought about by something
other than the work of art. </p>

<p> Of the 91 artists in the survey, 100 per cent reported having
had at least one psychedelic experience. When asked if they had
ever taken a psychedelic substance, 96 per cent answered
&quot;yes&quot; while 4 per cent answered &quot;no.&quot; </p>

<p> Of the chemical substances, LSD was mentioned by more artists
than any other drug, followed by marijuana, DMT, peyote,
mescaline, morning glory seeds, psilocybin, hashish, DET, and
yage. A few artists had tried Kava-Kava, ibogaine, bufotenin,
Ditran, the amanita muscaria mushroom, and the Hawaiian wood
rose. One artist reported experimenting with STP, a powerful and
long-lasting drug manufactured by an &quot;underground
chemist&quot; in California while several others had toasted and
smoked the inside of banana skins, usually with extremely mild
and inconsequential results. A few artists claimed to have
obtained psychedelic effects from substances generally not
considered psychedelic&#151;benzedrine (an amphetamine or psychic
energizer), opium (a narcotic), ritalin, kinotrine, amyl nitrate,
and nitrous oxide. </p>

<p> The artists surveyed were asked if their psychedelic
experiences (chemically as well as non-chemically induced) were
generally pleasant. An unqualified &quot;yes&quot; response was
given by 91 per cent of the group while 5 per cent gave a
qualified &quot;yes&quot; response. In the latter cases, it was
stated that some of their initial &quot;trips&quot; were
unpleasant but that their later experiences were pleasurable. One
artist answered this question negatively and three others did not
respond. </p>

<p> When the artists were asked, &quot;How have your psychedelic
experiences influenced your art}&quot; none of them felt that
their work had suffered as a result of psychedelic experience,
although some admitted that their friends might disagree with
this judgment. Three per cent of the artists stated that their
psychedelic experiences had not influenced their work one way or
the other, The others cited a number of effects which fell into
three broad categories: content, technique, and approach. In most
cases, the artists reported effects that fell into more than one
category. </p>

<p> Seventy per cent of the group stated that psychedelic
experience had affected the content of their work, the most
frequently cited example being their use of eidetic imagery as
subject matter. </p>

<p> Fifty-four per cent of the artists surveyed said there had
been a noticeable improvement in their artistic technique
resulting from their psychedelic sessions; a greater ability to
use color was the example mentioned most frequently. </p>

<p> Fifty-two per cent of the artists attributed a change in
their creative approach to the psychedelics. Frequently made was
the claim that psychedelic experience had eliminated
superficiality from the artists' work and had given them greater
depth as people and as creators. Some referred to their first
psychedelic experience as a &quot;peak experience,&quot; as a
turning point in their lives. &quot;My dormant interest in music
became an active one,&quot; said a musician, &quot;after a few
sessions with peyote and DMT.&quot; Another said that a
psilocybin experience &quot;caused me to enjoy the art of drawing
for the first time in my life.&quot; </p>

<p> The impact of psychedelic experience upon an individual was
illustrated in the case of Isaac Abrams, one of Krippner's
subjects. In an interview, the artist stated that
&quot;psychedelic experience has deeply influenced all aspects of
my life. It was an experience of self-recognition, under LSD,
which opened my eyes to drawing and painting as the means of
self-expression for which I had always been seeking. During
subsequent experiences, many difficulties, personal and artistic,
were resolved. When the personal difficulties were solved, energy
was released for the benefit of my art.&quot; </p>

<p> Upon graduation from college, Abrams got married, toured
Europe, and went to work selling furniture. &quot;I had been
taught,&quot; he said, &quot;that the most important things in
life were to look neat, act nice, and make money. Yet, I knew
that something was missing. There was something to do that I
wasn't doing. I had a sense of mission but no idea what the
mission might be.&quot; </p>

<p> Abrams was offered mescaline by a friend but turned it down.
Several years later, in 1962, he was offered psilocybin and
decided to give it a try. On Washington's birthday, Abrams and
his wife took psilocybin. Abrams watched the ceiling whirl,
turned off the lights, and realized for the first time that
during all the years of his life he had been behaving &quot;like
a person who had no mind.&quot; </p>

<p> Abrams enjoyed his psilocybin experience and a few months
later had another opportunity to try mescaline. &quot;We took it
in the country and it was beautiful.&quot; His next psychedelic
experiences were with marijuana; once again, these were pleasant
and positive in nature. </p>

<p> The inner life having been opened up by these episodes,
Abrams thought that he might discover his &quot;life's
mission.&quot; The search was in vain. He sold more furniture. He
wrote a play. He entered graduate school, but this was not for
him and he dropped out. </p>

<p> Early in 1965, Abrams took LSD. During his session, he began
to draw. &quot;As I worked,&quot; he recalled, &quot;I
experienced a process of selfrealization concerning the drawing.
When the drug wore off, I kept on drawing. I did at least one ink
drawing every few weeks.&quot; </p>

<p> Abrams attended art classes to learn about technique and
materials. His wife went to different classes, took notes, and
passed on the information to her husband. The skills developed
quickly and he began to paint. </p>

<p> Abrams entered psychoanalysis with a well-known psychoanalyst
who specialized in the creative process. The artist mused,
&quot;Analysis helps me to mobilize the psychedelic experience
and externalize it. I think any individual can go just so far on
his own. At some point he needs a spiritual teacher or guru. A
good psychoanalyst can be a guru. </p>

<p> &quot;For me,&quot; Abrams continued, &quot;the psychedelic
experience basically has been one of turning on to the life
process, to the dance of life with all of its motion and change.
Before 1962, my behavior was based on logical, rational, and
linear experience. Due to the psychedelics, I also became
influenced by experiences that were illogical, irrational, and
non- linear. But this, too, is a part of life. This aspect is
needed if life is to become interrelated and harmonious. </p>

<p> &quot;Psychedelic drugs give me a sense of harmony and
beauty. For the first time in my life, I can take pleasure in the
beauty of a leaf; I can find meaning in the processes of nature.
For me to paint an ugly picture would be a lie. It would be a
violation of what I have learned through psychedelic
experience.&quot; </p>

<p> Abrams continued, &quot;I have found that I can flow through
my pen and brush; everything I do becomes a part of
myself&#151;an exchange of energy. The canvas becomes a part of
my brain. With the psychedelics, you learn to think outside of
your head. My art attempts to express or reproduce my inner
state.&quot; Abrams concluded, &quot;Psychedelic experience
emphasizes the unity of things, the infinite dance. You are the
wave, but you are also the ocean.&quot; </p>

<p> Krippner noted that he rarely had found artists among the
casualties of illegal drug usage, suggesting that an artist must
stand somewhat apart from his culture in order to create.
&quot;To invent something new,&quot; Krippner concluded,
&quot;one cannot be completely conditioned or imprinted. Perhaps
it is this type of an individual&#151;the person who will not be
alarmed at what he perceives or conceptualizes during a
psychedelic session&#151;who can most benefit from these altered
states of consciousness.&quot; </p>

<p> Cohen (1964) summarized the research data on creativity and
the psychedelics by stating, &quot;Whether LSD does or does not
increase creativity remains an open question. No systematic
research is available to help in finding an answer. All that can
be said at this time about the effect of LSD on the creative
process is that a strong subjective feeling of creativeness
accompanies many of the experiences.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<p> <a name="footnote"></a>(footnote) An additional study
(Janinger, personal communication, 1967) is being evaluated at
the present time. Fifty prominent artists painted a picture of a
standard object (an American Indian doll) before ingesting LSD.
During their psychedelic sessions, they again painted the doll.
The 100 paintings are being evaluated on the basis of several
artistic criteria in an attempt to determine what type of change
took place as well as the artistic merit (or lack of merit)
reflected by the change. <a href="#back">(back)</a></p>

<h3>SELECTIVE ENHANCEMENT OF SPECIFIC CAPACITIES THROUGH
PSYCHEDELIC TRAINING </h3>

<p>WILLIS W. HARMAN AND JAMES FADIMAN </p>

<p>From: <i>PSYCHEDELICS, The Uses and Implications of
Hallucinogenic Drugs, </i>Bernard Aaronson and Humphrey Osmond,
editors, Doubleday &amp; Company, 1970. Copyright Aaronson &amp;
Osmond, Harman &amp; Fadiman. The following article is an
overview of the paper: Harman, et. al., in <i>Psychedelic Reports</i>
<b>19</b>, 211-27, 1966, &quot;Psychedelic Agents in Creative
Problem-Solving: A Pilot Study.&quot; </p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
    <p>(This article discusses exploratory work that was
    interrupted early in 1966 when the Food and Drug
    Administration, as a strategy in combating the illicit-use
    problem, declared a moratorium on research with normal human
    subjects. In view of the preliminary nature of the work, it
    would not under ordinary circumstances have been submitted
    for publication. However, because of the significance of the
    hypotheses, and because they are consistent with experience
    gained in a previous study of four hundred subjects who
    received psychedelics in a therapy context, and because of
    the hope that when it is again possible to resume psychedelic
    research the non-medical applications will get long-overdue
    attention, the decision was made to release these results in
    their present, unfinished form.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amid much controversy over the place of psychedelic chemicals
in contemporary culture, we have quietly entered a third phase of
the research on human uses of these agents. </p>

<p>The first phase, typically identified in the literature by the
use of the adjective &quot;psychotomimetic,&quot; was
characterized by dominance of <i>a priori</i> structured models.
Seriously underestimating the effects that such preconceptions
might have on the content and aftereffects of the subjective
experience, researchers variously reported that psychedelics
mimicked mental illness (when given in a setting that provoked
it), illuminated Freudian theory (when administered by a
competent Freudian), evoked Jungian archetypes (when administered
by a sensitive Jungian), substantiated the tenets of behavior
therapy (by increasing suggestibility and modifiability), and
demonstrated the soundness of the existential approach. </p>

<p>The second phase, adopting Osmond's neologism
&quot;psychedelic,&quot; was characterized by an emphasis on
allowing the drug session to run its natural course, in an
attempt to minimize the influence of the conceptions and
interpretations of the therapist or monitor. Care was taken to
provide such expectations, rapport, and environment that the
experience would be as non- threatening as possible. Opinions
varied as to what constitutes optimum set and setting, and
subjects and experimenters varied. As a consequence, reported
effects range from ecstasy to psychosis, from community to
isolation, from greatly enhanced mental and perceptual abilities
to greatly impaired abilities. From this work emerged a variety
of psychotherapeutic applications, well summarized by Hoffer
(1965), as well as widespread, mainly illicit, use with sensual,
philosophical, and transcendental goals. </p>

<p>Growing out of this informal experimentation and clinical
research, largely as a consequence of suggestive spontaneous
occurrences, the possibility gradually emerged that specific
kinds of performance might be selectively enhanced by deliberate
structuring of psychedelic-agent administrations. Thus a third
phase of psychedelic research began. Whereas, in the first phase,
experiences tended to be controlled and delimited---never mind if
inadvertently---by preconceptions of experimenter and subject,
and in the second phase they tended to be more uncontrolled and
wide-ranging in scope, now the emphasis was to be on deliberate
selection of specific aspects of the psychedelic experience and
of specific parameters of functioning. </p>

<p>As these experiments on specific performance enhancement
through directed use of the psychedelics have gone on in various
countries of the world, on both sides of the Iron Curtain, and
as, furthermore, some, at least, of the informal exploration has
been in defiance of existing laws governing use of the
psychedelic agents, publicly available information on results is
scant and scattered. In the remainder of this chapter we shall
discuss one pilot study in which the particular type of
performance chosen for attention was creative problem-solving
ability. The implications of the work are, we believe, much
broader than this particular application. Indeed, the basic
assumption underlying setting up the project, and not negated by
any of our observations during the course of the research, is
that, <i>given appropriate conditions, the psychedelic agents can
be employed to enhance any aspect of mental performance, in the
sense of making it more operationally effective.</i> While this
research was restricted to intellectual and artistic activity, we
believe the assumption holds true for any other mental,
perceptual, or emotional process. The psychedelic agent acts as a
facilitator, an adjunct to the situation it facilitates, neither
good nor evil, efficacious nor powerless, safe nor dangerous. </p>

<h4><i>Rationale Behind the Creative Problem-Solving Study </i></h4>

<p>Reports in the literature on psychedelic agents that deal with
effects on performance are inconclusive or contradictory. Changes
in performance levels have been intensively investigated, both
during and after the drug session. Instrumental learning has been
found to be impaired during the drug experience in some studies,
enhanced in others. Similarly, contradictory results have been
noted for color perception, recall and recognition,
discrimination learning, concentration, symbolic thinking, and
perceptual accuracy (Mogar, 1965a). </p>

<p>In some of the research, where impairment was reported, the
drug was used as a stresser with the intention of simulating
psychotic performance-impairment. Practically all of the formal
research in which improved performance was claimed subsequent to
the drug experience has been in a clinical context. Performance
enhancement during the drug experience has been sporadically
reported in both experimental and clinical research, but not in
general where the psychotomimetic orientation was dominant. </p>

<p>Our experience in clinical research (Mogar and Savage, 1964;
Fadiman 1965; Savage et al., 1966) had been amply convincing with
regard to the possibility of long-term performance enhancement
through employment of the psychedelic agents in a clinical
setting. We also had much evidence with regard to the subtlety
and pervasiveness of the influence of set and setting.
Furthermore, although they had not been deliberately sought,
there were numerous spontaneous incidents of what appeared to be
temporarily enhanced performance during the drug experience
itself. These observations led us to postulate the following
propositions: </p>

<p>1. Any human function, as generally elicited, can be performed
more effectively. This amounts to an acknowledgement that we do
not function at our full capacity. </p>

<p>2. The psychedelics appear to temporarily inhibit censors that
ordinarily limit the mental contents coming into conscious
awareness. The subject may, for example, discover his latent
ability to form colored imagery, to hallucinate, to recall
forgotten experiences of early childhood, to generate meaningful
symbolic presentations, etc. By leading the subject to expect
enhancement of other types of performance---creative problem
solving, learning manual or verbal skills, manipulating logical
or mathematical symbols, sensory or extrasensory perception,
memory and recall---and by providing favorable preparatory and
environmental conditions, it may be possible to improve the level
of functioning in any desired respect. </p>

<p>3. Both objective and subjective indicators of mental
performance are appropriate to use in establishing whether there
has indeed been an improvement (or impairment) of performance.<a
name="back1"> </a></p>

<p>As <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> indicates, commonly observed
characteristics of the psychedelic experience seem to operate
both for and against the hypothesis that the drug session could
be used for performance enhancement. In this research we
attempted to provide a setting that would maximize those
characteristics that tend toward improved functioning, while
minimizing those that might hinder effective functioning. </p>

<p>For several reasons we chose to focus our efforts on creative
problem solving. One was its obvious utility, an important
consideration at that juncture because of the increasing pressure
for stricter regulation of the psychedelics by those who doubted
that they were good for anything at all. Another factor was that
many of the observed spontaneous occurrences had been of this
sort. Finally, because of extensive recent research activity in
the field of creativity, a number of relevant objective measures
were available for use. Interest centered on three questions: </p>

<p>1. Can the psychedelic experience enhance creative
problem-solving ability, and if so, what is the evidence of
enhancement? </p>

<p>2. Can this result in enhanced production of concrete, valid,
and feasible solutions assessable by the pragmatic criteria of
modern industry and positivistic science? </p>

<p>3. Working with a non-clinical population and with a
non-therapy orientation, would there nevertheless result
demonstrable long-term personality changes indicative of
continued increased creativity and self- actualization? </p>

<h4><i>Procedure </i></h4>

<p>The subjects in these experiments were twenty-seven males
engaged in a variety of professional occupations (sixteen
engineers, one engineer-physicist, two mathematicians, two
architects, one psychologist, one furniture designer, one
commercial artist, one sales manager, and one personnel manager).
Nineteen of the subjects had had no previous experience with
psychedelics. The following selection criteria were established: </p>

<p>1. Participant's occupation normally requires problem-solving
ability. </p>

<p>2. Participant is found to be psychologically stable as
determined by psychiatric interview- examination. </p>

<p>3. Participant is motivated to discover, verify, and apply
solutions within his current work capacity. </p>

<p>Each group of four subjects met one another during an evening
session several days before the experimental day. (In one of the
groups, one subject had to be eliminated, which left only three.)
The proposed sequence of events during the experimental session
was explained in detail. This initial meeting also served the
function of allaying apprehension and establishing rapport and
trust among the members and the staff. </p>

<p>Subjects were told that they would experience little or no
difficulties with distractions such as visions, involvement with
personal emotional states, and so on. The instructions emphasized
that the experience could be directed as desired. Direct
suggestions were made to encourage mental flexibility during the
session. An excerpt from those instructions is quoted below: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some suggestions on approaches: </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Try identifying with the central person, object, or
    process in the problem. See how the problem looks from this
    vantage point. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Try asking to &quot;see&quot; the solution, to visualize
    how various parts might work together, to see how a certain
    situation will work out in future, etc. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You will find it is possible to scan a large number of
    possible solutions, ideas, data from the memory etc., much
    more rapidly than usual. The &quot;right&quot; solution will
    often appear along with a sort of intuitive
    &quot;knowing&quot; that it is the answer sought. You will
    also find that you can hold in conscious awareness a number
    of ideas or pieces of data processes simultaneously, to an
    uncommon extent. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You will find it is possible to &quot;step&quot; back from
    the problem and see it in new perspective, in more basic
    terms; to abandon previously tried approaches and start
    afresh (since there is much less of yourself invested in
    these earlier trials). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Above all, don't be timid in the ambitiousness with which
    you ask questions. If you want to see the completed solution
    in a three-dimensional image, or to project yourself forward
    in time, or view some microscopic physical process, or view
    something not visible to your physical eyes, or re-experience
    some event out of the past, by all means ask. Don't let your
    questions be limited by your notion of what can and what
    cannot happen. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Approximately one hour of pencil-and-paper tests were
administered at this time. Subjects were told that they would
take a similar battery during the experimental session. To insure
that the problems to be worked on were appropriate for the
purpose, each participant was asked to present his selection
briefly. By the end of the preparation session, participants were
generally anticipative and at ease. They had been given a clear
picture of what to expect, as well as information on how to cope
with any difficulties that might arise. </p>

<p>The session day was spent as follows: </p>

<p>8:30 Arrive at session room </p>

<p>9:00 Psychedelic material given. Mescaline sulphate (200 mg). </p>

<p>9-12 Music played, subjects relaxed with eyes closed </p>

<p>12-1 Psychological tests administered </p>

<p>1-5 Subjects work on problems </p>

<p>5-6 Discussion of experience; review of solutions. </p>

<p>Participants were driven home after this. They were given a
sedative, which they might take if they experienced any
difficulty in sleeping. In many cases, however, they preferred to
stay up until well after midnight, continuing to work on insights
and solutions discovered earlier in the day. </p>

<p>Each subject wrote a subjective account of his experience
within a week after the experimental session. Approximately six
weeks after the session, subjects were administered
questionnaires that related to (1) the effects of the session on
post-session creative ability and (2) the validity and acceptance
of solutions conceived during the session. These data were in
addition to the psychometric data comparing results of the two
testing periods. </p>

<h4><i>Subjective Reports </i></h4>

<p>The literature on creativity includes analytical description
of the components of creative experience, the personal
characteristics of creative individuals, and the distinguishing
features of creative solutions. From the participants' reports,
it was possible to extract eleven strategies of enhanced
functioning during the session. The relationship of these
strategies to enhanced functioning should be self-explanatory.
Those readers interested in the relationship of these aspects to
current research and theory on creativity can refer to the
detailed technical discussion in Harman, McKim et al. (1966). </p>

<p>The factors are listed below with representative quotations
from the subjects' reports. </p>

<h6>1. Low Inhibition and Anxiety: </h6>

<p>&quot;There was no fear, no worry, no sense of reputation and
competition, no envy, none of these things which in varying
degrees have always been present in my work.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;A lowered sense of personal danger; I don't feel
threatened any more, and there is no feeling of my reputation
being at stake.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Although doing well on these problems would be fine,
failure to get ahead on them would be threatening. However, as it
turned out, on this afternoon the normal blocks in the way of
progress seemed to be absent.&quot; </p>

<h6>2. Capacity to Restructure Problem in Larger Context: </h6>

<p>&quot;Looking at the same problem with (psychedelic)
materials, I was able to consider it in a much more basic way,
because I could form and keep in mind a much broader
picture.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I could handle two or three different ideas at the same
time and keep track of each.&quot; &quot;Normally I would
overlook many more trivial points for the sake of expediency, but
under the drug, time seemed unimportant. I faced every possible
questionable issue square in the face.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ability to start from the broadest general basis in the
beginning . . .&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I returned to the original problem.... I tried, I think
consciously, to think of the problem in its totality, rather than
through the devices I had used before.&quot; </p>

<h6>3. Enhanced Fluency and Flexibility of Ideation: </h6>

<p>&quot;I began to work fast, almost feverishly, to keep up with
the flow of ideas.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I began to draw . . . my senses could not keep up with
my images . . . my hand was not fast enough . . . my eyes were
not keen enough . . . I was impatient to record the picture (it
has not faded one particle). I worked at a pace I would not have
thought I was capable of.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was very impressed with the ease with which ideas
appeared (it was virtually as if the world is made of ideas, and
so it is only necessary to examine any part of the world to get
an idea). I also got the feeling that creativity is an active
process in which you limit yourself and have an objective, so
there is a focus about which ideas can cluster and relate.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;. . . I dismissed the original idea entirely, and
started to approach the graphic problem in a radically different
way. That was when things started to happen. All kinds of
different possibilities came to mind....&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And the feeling during this period of profuse production
was one of joy and exuberance.... It was the pure fun of doing,
inventing, creating, and playing.&quot; </p>

<h6>4. Heightened Capacity for Visual Imagery and Fantasy: </h6>

<p>&quot;Was able to move imaginary parts in relation to each
other.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;. . . it was the non-specific fantasy that triggered the
idea.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The next insight came as an image of an oyster shell,
with the mother-of-pearl shining in different colors. I
translated that in the idea of an interferometer-two layers
separated by a gap equal to the wave length it is desired to
reflect.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;. . . As soon as I began to visualize the problem, one
possibility immediately occurred. A few problems with that
concept occurred, which seemed to solve themselves rather
quickly.... Visualizing the required cross section was
instantaneous.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Somewhere along in here, I began to see an image of the
circuit. The gates themselves were little silver cones linked
together by lines. I watched the circuit flipping through its
paces.. . .&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I began visualizing all the properties known to me that
a photon possesses and attempted to make a model for a photon....
The photon was comprised of an electron and a positron cloud
moving together in an intermeshed synchronized helical orbit....
This model was reduced for visualizing purposes to a black and
white ball propagating in a screw-like fashion through space. I
kept putting the model through all sorts of known tests.&quot; </p>

<h6>5. Increased Ability to Concentrate: </h6>

<p>&quot;Was able to shut out virtually all distracting
influences.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was easily able to follow a train of thought to a
conclusion where normally I would have been distracted many
times.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was impressed with the intensity of concentration, the
forcefulness and exuberance with which I could proceed toward the
solution.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I considered the process of photoconductivity.... I kept
asking myself, &quot;What is light?&quot; and subsequently,
&quot;What is a photon?&quot; The latter question I repeated to
myself several hundred times till it was being said automatically
in synchronism with each breath. I probably never in my life
pressured myself as intently with a question as I did this
one.&quot; &quot;It is hard to estimate how long this problem
might have taken without the psychedelic agent, but it was the
type of problem that might never have been solved. It would have
taken a great deal of effort and racking of the brains to arrive
at what seemed to come more easily during the session.&quot; </p>

<h6>6. Heightened Empathy with External Processes and Objects: </h6>

<p>&quot;. . . the sense of the problem as a living thing that is
growing toward its inherent solution.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;First I somehow considered being the needle and being
bounced around in the groove.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I spent a productive period . . . climbing down on my
retina, walking around and thinking about certain problems
relating to the mechanism of vision.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ability to grasp the problem in its entirety, to 'dive'
into it without reservations, almost like becoming the
problem&quot; &quot;Awareness of the problem itself rather than
the 'I' that is trying to solve it&quot; </p>

<h6>7. Heightened Empathy with People: </h6>

<p>&quot;It was also felt that group performance was affected in
. . . subtle ways. This may be evidence that some sort of group
action was going on all the time.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Only at intervals did I become aware of the music.
Sometimes, when I felt the other guys listening to it; and it was
a physical feeling of them listening to it.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes we even had the feeling of having the same
thoughts or ideas.&quot; </p>

<h6>8. Subconscious Data More Accessible: </h6>

<p>&quot;. . . brought about almost total recall of a course that
I had had in thermodynamics; something that I had never given any
thought about in years.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was in my early teens and wandering through the
gardens where I actually grew up. I felt all my prior emotions in
relation to my surroundings.&quot; </p>

<h6>9. Association of Dissimilar Ideas: </h6>

<p>&quot;I had earlier devised an arrangement for beam steering
on the two-mile accelerator which reduced the amount of hardware
necessary by a factor of two.... Two weeks ago it was pointed out
to me that this scheme would steer the beam into the wall and
therefore was unacceptable. During the session, I looked at the
schematic and asked myself how could we retain the factor of two
but avoid steering into the wall. Again a flash of inspiration,
in which I thought of the word &quot;alternate.&quot; I followed
this to its logical conclusion, which was to alternate polarities
sector by sector so the steering bias would not add but cancel. I
was extremely impressed with this solution and the way it came to
me.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Most of the insights come by association.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It was the last idea that I thought was remarkable
because of the way in which it developed. This idea was the
result of a fantasy that occurred during Wagner [Note: the
participant had earlier listened to Wagner's 'Ride of the
Valkyries.'].... I put down a line which seemed to embody this
[fantasy].... I later made the handle which my sketches suggested
and it had exactly the quality I was looking for.... I was very
amused at the ease with which all of this was done.&quot; </p>

<h6>l0. Heightened Motivation to Obtain Closure: </h6>

<p>&quot;Had tremendous desire to obtain an elegant solution (the
most for the least) .&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;All known constraints about the problem were
simultaneously imposed as I hunted for possible solutions. It was
like an analog computer whose output could not deviate from what
was desired and whose input was continually perturbed with the
inclination toward achieving the output.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It was almost an awareness of the 'degree of perfection'
of whatever I was doing.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;In what seemed like ten minutes, I had completed the
problem, having what I considered (and still consider) a classic
solution.&quot; </p>

<h6>11. Visualizing the Completed Solution: </h6>

<p>&quot;I looked at the paper I was to draw on. I was completely
blank. I knew that I would work with a property three hundred
feet square. I drew the property lines (at a scale of one inch to
forty feet), and I looked at the outlines. I was blank. </p>

<p>Suddenly I saw the finished project [Note: the project was a
shopping center specializing in arts and crafts]: I did some
quick calculations . . . it would fit on the property and not
only that . . . it would meet the cost and income requirements .
. . it would park enough cars . . . it met all the requirements.
It was contemporary architecture with the richness of a cultural
heritage . . . it used history and experience but did not copy
it.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I visualized the result I wanted and subsequently
brought the variables into play which could bring that result
about. I had great visual (mental) perceptibility; I could
imagine what was wanted, needed, or not possible with almost no
effort. I was amazed at my idealism, my visual perception, and
the rapidity with which I could operate.&quot; </p>

<h4><i>Results: Subjective Ratings </i></h4>

<p>As mentioned above, several weeks after the experimental
session all participants were asked to complete a brief
questionnaire. Here they rated their experience with respect to
nine characteristics relevant to enhanced functioning. Items were
rated on a five-point scale from MARKED ENHANCEMENT (+2) through
NO CHANGE (O) to MARKED IMPAIRMENT (-2) . The average ratings are
listed in <a href="#table2">Table 2.</a> These data, too, seem to
substantiate the hypothesis of enhancement of both verbal and
non-verbal skills.<a name="back2"> </a></p>

<h4><i>Results: Psychometric Data </i></h4>

<p>Test-retest scores on some of the measures used showed
dramatic changes from normal to psychedelic-session conditions.
Most apparent were enhanced abilities to recognize patterns, to
minimize and isolate visual distractions, and to maintain visual
memory in spite of confusing changes of form and color. Specific
tests used included the Purdue Creativity, the Miller Object
Visualization, and the Witkin Embedded Figures. This last test
has been reported to be stable under a variety of experimental
interventions including stress, training, sensory isolation,
hypnosis, and the influence of a variety of drugs (Witkin et al.,
1962). With these twenty-seven subjects, enhancement was
consistent (p&lt;.01), and in some cases improvements were as
great as 200 per cent. (For a fuller description of the
psychometric evaluation, see Harman et al., 1966.) </p>

<h4><i>Long-term Results </i></h4>

<p>The practical value of obtained solutions is a check against
subjective reports of accomplishment that might be attributable
to temporary euphoria. The nature of these solutions varied; they
included: (1) a new approach to the design of a vibratory
microtome, (2) a commercial building design, accepted by the
client, (3) space probe experiments devised to measure solar
properties, (4) design of a linear electron accelerator
beam-steering device, (5) engineering improvement to a magnetic
tape recorder, (6) a chair design, modeled and accepted by the
manufacturer, (7) a letterhead design, approved by the customer,
(8) a mathematical theorem regarding NOR-gate circuits, (9)
completion of a furniture-line design, (10) a new conceptual
model of a photon, which was found useful, and (11) design of a
private dwelling, approved by the client.<a name="back3"> </a></p>

<p><a href="#table3">Table 3</a> outlines the initial results of
attempting to apply the solutions generated in the experimental
sessions back into the industrial and academic settings of the
subjects. (These data were obtained by questionnaire and
follow-up interview six to eight weeks after the session.) A
quote for a follow-up report written several months after the
session is typical of the relative usefulness and validity of the
session-day solutions: &quot;In the area of ionospheric source
location and layer tilt analysis, I was able in the weeks
following the session to build on the ideas generated to the
extent of working out the mathematics of the schemes proposed,
and of making them more definite. The steps made in the session
were the correct ones to start with . . . the ideas considered
and developed in the session appear as important steps, and the
period of the session as the single most productive period of
work on this problem I have had in the several months either
preceding or following the session.&quot; </p>

<p>Many subjects in the follow-up interview reported changes in
their modes of functioning that were continuous with the
enhancement reported for the session itself (e.g., continuing
visualization ability). Table 4 lists the result of a
questionnaire dealing with changes in work effectiveness.<a
name="back4"> </a></p>

<p>The results given in <a href="#table4">Table 4</a> indicate
that approximately half the subjects reporting were still
noticing some change in their performance level several months
after the experimental session. These results are particularly
interesting in view of the relatively low dosage and the fact
that no suggestion was made at any time that continuing changes
of this nature were expected. The deliberate anticipation of
enhanced performance level, the incitement to a high degree of
motivation, and use of a sheltered and non-critical
atmosphere---none of these were directly suggestive of long-term
personality changes or permanent therapeutic benefit. Yet a
certain amount of such change seems to have occurred. One
implication is clear: We are dealing with materials and
experimental situations that have long-term effects; it would be
foolhardy and irresponsible to treat this kind of research as if
it were isolated from the fabric of the subjects' lives. </p>

<h4><i>Comments and Speculations </i></h4>

<p>We had originally intended to follow this pilot study with a
controlled experiment employing a double-blind design, in which a
fraction of the subjects receive an active placebo. This would
have addressed the question of whether suggestion alone could
account for the performance enhancement. Because of interruption
of the research program by government fiat, this extension was
never carried out. The need for controlled hypothesis-testing
research in this perplexing area of chemical facilitation of
mental functioning has become a common plea, and rightly so. But
equally needful of furthering is the exploratory sort of research
that aims at invention of conceptual models and hypothesis
construction. Because of the controversy surrounding use of the
psychedelic agents, this latter type of research is even more
likely to be slighted. </p>

<p>In the research described, we employed naive subjects. There
are clear methodological virtues accruing from the use of
untrained subjects. However, when the central question is not one
of pharmacological effects, but rather the degree to which
certain processes can be facilitated, the more experience the
subjects can gain the more we are likely to learn about the
process. Thus we would urge the desirability of further
investigations employing a series of sessions for each subject. </p>

<p>A similar comment holds with regard to selection of subjects.
Clinical studies already referred to indicate that those subjects
who are more stable and productive beforehand 4 tend to
&quot;benefit considerably from the psychedelic experience along
the lines of self-actualization, richer creative experience, and
enhancement of special abilities and aptitudes&quot; (Savage et
al., 1966). Subjects for this pilot study were deliberately
selected to be persons with known reputations as creative
individuals. In general, we would expect the outcomes of this
kind of research to be more fruitful with gifted rather than
&quot;merely normal&quot; subjects. </p>

<p>In contrast with reports of other researchers, we experienced
little difficulty in getting subjects to work on psychological
tests. Many studies seem to indicate a temporary debilitating
effect of psychedelics on higher cortical processes. It seems to
us that variables that affect results on these kinds of tests
include attitude and motivation as well as ability. We found that
discussing this problem with subjects in the preparatory meetings
eliminated any tendency in the experimental session to shrug off
the tests as meaningless or to resist them as disconcerting. In
short, on the tests, as well as in problem solving, by
establishing an anticipation of improved performance, we seemed
to obtain results that support it. </p>

<p>Assuming that these findings are eventually substantiated by
additional research, they find their most obvious application to
problem solving in industry, professional practice, and research.
Here the procedure could play a role similar to that played by
consultants, brainstorming, synectics, and other attempts to
augment and &quot;unstick&quot; the problem solver's unsuccessful
efforts. A quote from one of our subjects illustrates the
possibilities: </p>

<p>&quot;I decided to drop my old line of thinking and give it a
new try. The 'mystery' of this easy dismissal and forgetting did
not strike me until later in the afternoon, because I had many
times before this session indulged in this line of thinking and
managed to work up the whole thing into an airtight deadlock, and
I had been unable to break, much less dismiss, this deadlock. The
miracle is that it came so easy and natural.&quot; </p>

<p>A much more important application in the long run, we believe,
is the use of the psychedelic agents as training facilitators to
gradually upgrade the performance level of already effective
personnel. This would require establishment of accepted training
procedures and certification provisions for those qualified to
use them. This may seem to be a utopian projection from our
present state, but we live in an age of rapid change, and it is
perhaps not out of the question within a decade. </p>

<p>Among consequences of this line of exploration, the most
significant of all, in our estimation, is the gaining of new
knowledge of the mysterious higher processes of the human mind,
the framing of new and more productive research questions, and
the eventual effect on our image of man---of what he can be, and
of what he is, of the vast potentialities he has seemingly only
begun to tap. </p>

<H2>THE EFFECTS OF PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE<BR>ON LANGUAGE FUNCTIONING
</H2>

<H3>STANLEY KRIPPNER, Ph.D.</H3>

<P>
From: <I>PSYCHEDELICS, The Uses and Implications of Hallucinogenic
Drugs</I><BR>edited by Bernard Aaronson and Humphry Osmond, Doubleday
&amp; Company, 1970.<BR>&copy; Aaronson &amp; Osmond.</CENTER><HR>

<P>
A. J. Ayer (1946, p. 65) once claimed, &quot;. . . we are unable,
in our everyday language, to describe the properties of sense-contents
with any great precision, for lack of the requisite symbols....&quot;
Ayer's statement about normal, everyday perception has even greater
application when chemically altered perception is considered.
The difficulties subjects have in describing their experiences
are compounded by the difficulties experimenters often have in
interpreting these reports in terms of some organizational structure.
<P>
One of the more successful attempts to organize subjective reports
of psychedelic experience has been made by R. E. L. Masters and
Jean Houston (1966). Having guided and observed 206 subjects through
a large number of LSD and peyote sessions, Masters and Houston
proposed the existence of four levels of mental functioning in
the psychedelic state: sensory, recollective-analytic, symbolic,
and integral.
<P>
At the first, or sensory, level, the subject may report a changed
awareness of the body, unusual ways of experiencing space and
time, heightened sense impressions, synesthesia (&quot;feeling
sounds,&quot; &quot;hearing color&quot;), and---with the eyes
closed---vivid visual imagery. Experiences at the sensory level
tend to &quot;decondition&quot; a subject, to loosen his habitual
conceptions, and to ease the rigidity of his past imprinting.
<P>
At the second, or recollective-analytic, level, the subject's
reactions become more emotionally intense. He may relive periods
of his life. He may formulate insights into himself, his work,
and his personal relationships.
<P>
Only 40 per cent of Masters and Houston's subjects reached the
third, or symbolic, level. At this level, visual imagery generally
involves history and legend, or the subject may recapitulate the
evolutionary process, developing from primordial protoplasm to
man. He may also embark upon a &quot;ritual of passage&quot; and
imagine himself participating in a baptismal ceremony or a puberty
rite.
<P>
Eleven per cent of Masters and Houston's subjects reached the
fourth, or integral, level, at which religious or mystical experiences
occur. Masters and Houston have described the religious experience
as a confrontation with &quot;the Ground of Being&quot;; they
contrast it with mystical experience, which they see as a dissolution,
as a merging of the individual with the energy field of the universe.
One woman related, &quot;All around and passing through me was
the Light, a trillion atomized crystals shimmering in the blinding
incandescence.&quot;
<H4>The Evolution of Language</H4>

<P>
Like psychedelic experience, human language processes may be studied
at four different levels. The development of social language begins
at the approximate age of nine months, with the acquisition of
a simple listening vocabulary (Lewis, 1959). By one year, most
children have spoken their first word. In the American culture,
two other forms of language -reading and writing-are usually introduced
when the child enters school, although some children acquire these
before formal education begins. Speaking and writing are expressive,
and involve encoding one's experiences; listening and reading
are receptive, and require decoding of another person's attempts
to communicate. Speaking and listening have developmental priority
over the visual activities of writing and reading.
<P>
Language may be defined as a structured system of arbitrary vocal
sounds and sound sequences, or a system of written or printed
symbols that represent vocal sounds. A language system is used
in social, interpersonal communication, and rather exhaustively
catalogues the objects, events, and processes in the human environment.
<P>
The origins of oral language go back over a million years. Primitive
man kept no written records and lost the words he uttered in time
and space. Writing started only a few thousand years ago, when
man developed hieroglyphics and ideographs to represent visible
objects. Among the cultures bordering the Mediterranean, these
standardized sets of pictures gave way to phonetic alphabets,
in which the written symbol stands not for an object, but for
a sound.
<P>
The alphabet restructured not only man's method of communicating,
but also his very conception of the time-space milieu. The alphabet
arrested words in spatial rather than temporal segments, and literate
human cultures began to conceive of the universe in terms of linear
space diagrams as well as temporal cycles. The day-night cycle,
the life-death cycle, and other recurring events gave way in importance
to conceiving events as historical, linear, and exhibiting cause-
effect relationships.
<P>
For several centuries, the development of the alphabet affected
most people indirectly in the cultures where it was used. Written
language was difficult to master; its utilization was often reserved
for scribes, philosophers, and priests. The invention of the printing
press and movable type made reading a common skill and, according
to Marshall McLuhan (1964), further exploded the tribal world
and led to the fragmentation of society and to the specialization
of mankind's functions. The priestly monopoly on knowledge and
power came to an end.
<P>
The technical and cultural achievements resulting from movable
type show the tremendous impact of literacy. However, the linear
structuring of rational life forced the Western world to regard
consciousness as sequential, and brought about its habit of investing
events with cause-effect relations. As Western man became dissociated
from the tribe and from direct experience, visual sequencing became
the key skill used in examining and storing the symbolic record
of his accomplishments.
<P>
Just as the voice-and-ear stage of language once gave way to what
Walter Ong (1967) has referred to as the &quot;chirographic-typographic&quot;
stage (dominated by the alphabet and the printing press), so this
stage is now giving way to an electronic stage. Television, telephone,
radio, phonograph, film and recording tape have reinstated the
importance of sound in communication. These media also convey
a sense of simultaneity in time and space. A new aural structure
is being superimposed upon the old visual structure of the chirographic-typographic
stage. As technology unites the scattered human cultures into
a new solidarity, the contemporary individual must have all cultures
present within him simultaneously in order to be realized as a
human being.
<P>
At the same time that the electronic stage is extending man's
exploration outside the body, it is creating a desire for exploration
of the individual's inner world. One example is the widespread
interest in psychedelic substances. Many Americans, having ingested
these chemicals, echo McLuhan's and Ong's theories. They state
that their psychedelic episodes bring about &quot;a sense of simultaneity
in time and space,&quot; and &quot;a sense of solidarity with
all the people in the world.&quot; Others gather into drug or
&quot;hippie&quot; subcultures, in which tribal rites are enacted,
in which bright Indian clothes and primitive body markings are
worn, and in which an intense sense of community often develops.
<P>
A limited number of attempts have been made to investigate the
effects of psychedelic experience on either receptive language
(listening and reading) or expressive language (speaking and writing).
The four levels of psychedelic experience (sensory, recollective-analytic,
symbolic, integral) provide an organizational structure in which
this area may be explored and discussed.
<H4>Receptive Language</H4>

<P>
Trouton and Eysenck (1961) have pointed out that psychedelic experience
is influenced not only by factors related to drug administration,
but by personality, physiology, set, and setting. In their account,
they also mention &quot;suggestion&quot; and &quot;reinforcement
of responses by the experimenter,&quot; which suggests the importance
of language in determining how a subject reacts.
<P>
The ritual developed by the Native American Church illustrates
the use of language to produce a positive set and setting for
the ingestion of peyote. A ceremonial leader, the head chief,
initiates the singing of songs and co-ordinates requests by individuals
for special prayers. The ritual is so arranged and so coordinated
to the needs of the communicants that the maximum possible likelihood
of a positive spiritual experience is enhanced (Flattery and Pierce,
1965).
<P>
Language, however, may also be used to develop a negative set
and setting. Jean Houston (1967) has described one of her initial
observations of LSD administration. The subject was told by the
psychiatrist that he would have &quot;a terrible, terrible experience&quot;
filled with &quot;strong anxiety and delusions.&quot; The drug
was administered in an antiseptic hospital room with several observers
in white coats watching him. As the effects came on, the psychiatrist
asked such questions as, &quot;Is your anxiety increasing?&quot;
At the end of the experiment, the subject was in a state of panic.
The psychiatrist announced to the group that LSD is indeed a &quot;psychotomimetic&quot;
substance, which induces psychotic behavior.
<P>
Listening is the receptive process by which aural language assumes
meaning. As listening involves attending to a stimulus, the act
often includes a commitment to respond in some way to the messages
that are received. The Native American Church communicants commit
themselves to a positive experience while the unfortunate subjects
of poorly handled LSD experiments commit themselves to a negative
experience. In both cases, language plays a key role in determining
which way the commitment will turn.
<P>
A vivid description of a psychedelic session has been given by
Alan Watts (1962). This description demonstrates how the quality
of what is listened to may change as the listener shifts from
the sensory to the recollective-analytic, symbolic, and integral
levels.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am listening to the music of an organ.... The organ seems quite
literally to speak. There is no use of the vox humana stop, but
every sound seems to issue from a vast human throat, moist with
saliva....(p. 33)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is the sensory level of the psychedelic experience. Perceptual
changes have transformed the organ music into a human voice. Sense
impressions other than aural take form as Watts speaks of &quot;a
vast human throat, wet with saliva.&quot;
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am listening to a priest chanting the Mass, and a choir of nuns
responding. His mature, cultivated voice rings with the serene
authority of the One, Holy, Catholic, an-d Apostolic Church, of
the Faith once and for all delivered to the saints, and the nuns
respond naively it seems, with childlike, utterly innocent devotion.
But listening again, I can hear the priest &quot;putting on&quot;
his voice, hear the inflated, pompous balloon, the studiedly unctuous
tones of a master deceptionist who has the poor little nuns, kneeling
in their stalls completely cowed. Listen deeper. The nuns are
not cowed at all. They are playing possum. With just a little
stiffening, the limp gesture of bowing nuns turns into the gesture
of the closing claw. With too few men to go around, the nuns know
what is good for them: how to bend and survive. (p. 37)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is the recollective-analytic level, at which memories and
insights often occur. Watts is listening to a recording of the
Mass, but suddenly perceives a pompous quality to the priest's
tones. Going deeper into the analysis of what he hears, Watts
discovers that the nuns' response displays more than obedience---it
is their shrewd way of playing the game of survival.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But this profoundly cynical view of things is only an intermediate
stage.... In the priest's voice I hear down at the root the primordial
howl of the beast in the jungle, but it has been inflected, complicated,
refined, and textured with centuries of culture.... At first,
crude and unconcealed, the cry for food or mate, or just noise
for the fun of it, making the rocks echo. Then rhythm to enchant,
then changes of tone to plead or threaten. Then words to specify
the need, to promise and bargain. And then, much later, the gambits
of indirection. The feminine stratagem of stooping to conquer,
the claim to superior worth in renouncing the world for the spirit,
the cunning of weakness proving stronger than the might of muscle-and
the meek inheriting the earth. (p. 38)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is the psychedelic experience's symbolic stage. The priest's
voice reflects the evolutionary process; the nuns' response echoes
female archetypes.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As I listen then, I can hear in that one voice the simultaneous
presence of all the levels of man's history, as of all the stages
of life before man. Every step in the game becomes as clear as
the rings in a severed tree.... I, as an adult, am also back there
alone in the dark, just as the primordial howl is still present
beneath the sublime modulations of the chant.... Down and at last
out---out of the cosmic maze . . ., I feel, with a peace so deep
that it sings to be shared with all the world, that at last I
belong, that I have returned to the home beyond home.... The sure
foundation upon which I had sought to stand has turned out to
be the center from which I seek. (p. 39)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is the integral stage of the psychedelic experience. Watts
sees himself in the voice of the priest and in all the precursors
of that voice. His &quot;home beyond home&quot; and &quot;sure
foundation&quot; is the very center of his being.
<P>
Reading, the assigning of meaning to perceived printed symbols,
also plays a key role in some psychedelic sessions. In one experiment
(Jarvik et al., 1955), subjects ingested one hundred micrograms
of LSD and demonstrated an increase in their ability to quickly
cancel out words on a page of standardized material, but a decreased
ability to cancel out individual letters. The drug seemed to facilitate
the perceptions of meaningful language units while it interfered
with the visual perception of non-meaningful ones. Corroborative
experimental data are lacking, but a number of clinical cases
suggest that if the meaning of printed symbols happens to dovetail
with the ongoing psychedelic experience, the symbols will be perceived
quickly. If their meaning does not happen to tie in with the experience,
the words may not be perceived at all.
<P>
One subject became fascinated by a newspaper headline and reportedly
was able to read the entire article at a distance of thirty feet
(Newland, 1962). Another subject, who became interested in studying
famous paintings after ingesting thirty milligrams of psilocybin,
assertedly lost his reading ability entirely while under the influence
of the drug. <A NAME="back1"></A><A HREF="#footnote1">(1)</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In college, I had studied central nervous system dysfunction and
knew that psycholexia is a condition in which a person has difficulty
attaching meaning to printed symbols. I experienced a similar
condition after the psilocybin began to take effect.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I glanced at my watch but could make no sense out of the numerical
symbols. I looked at an art magazine The pictures were beautiful
almost three dimensional. However, the script was a jumble of
meaningless shapes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The same subject, near the end of his &quot;psilocybin high,&quot;
reported still another alteration in the reading process:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Earlier, I had tasted an orange and found it the most intense,
delightful taste sensation I had ever experienced. I tried reading
a magazine as I was &quot;coming down,&quot; and felt the same
sensual delight in moving my eye over the printed page as I had
experienced when eating the orange.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The words stood out in three dimensions. Reading had never been
such a sheer delight and such a complete joy. My comprehension
was excellent. I quickly grasped the intent of the author and
felt that I knew exactly what meaning he had tried to convey.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In the former instance, motivation for reading was low, since
the subject was interested in studying art prints. In the latter
episode, the pleasure of eating an orange permeated the act of
reading a magazines which then became a delightful experience.
<P>
The cases cited above both involved the sensory level of psychedelic
experience. Masters and Houston (1966) presented an intriguing
example of a subject who visualized a reading experience while
at the recollective-analytic level of his LSD session:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I recalled detail that under ordinary conditions I could not possibly
have remembered including the address on an envelope of a letter
that a friend had sent me some years before---an important letter,
since it had great significance for me during my analysis. I saw
the envelope in front of me, in my mind's eye, recalled the handwriting
and recited the street number and street. (A few days later I
went to an attic where I had old letters put away, dug into a
dust-laden box, and took out crumpled and yellowing old papers.
There7 among them, I found the envelope, just as I had recalled
it, and the details of the address were correct, entirely correct.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
P. G. Stafford and B. H. Golightly (1967, pp. 140-41) have cited
the account of a student who utilized the recollective-analytic
level to practical advantages learning enough German in a week
to enroll for an advanced course in the subject:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I hadn't even gotten around to picking up a textbook, but I did
have a close friend who knew German well and who said he was willing
to &quot;sit in&quot; while I took the drug and try to teach me
the language. ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The thing that impressed me at first was the delicacy of the language.
. . . Before long, I was catching on even to the umlauts. Things
were speeding up like mad, and there were floods of associations.
. . . Memory, of course, is a matter of association and boy was
I ever linking up to things! I had no difficulty recalling words
he had given me-in fact, I was eager to string them together.
In a couple of hours after that, I was even reading some simple
German, and it all made sense.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
By the time the student finished the LSD session, he had &quot;fallen
in love with German.&quot; He secured the original German text
and an English translation of Mann's <I>Doctor Faustus</I>. By
the time he had finished the novel, he found that he was scarcely
referring to the English version. He also discovered that in having
read <I>Doctor Faustus</I>, he had developed a feeling for grammar
structure and word endings that was &quot;almost intuitive.&quot;
<P>
When he registered for the second-year college course in German
the following week, the instructor expressed skepticism when he
heard that the student was self-taught. Upon testing him, however,
it was evident that the student's German reading comprehension
was more than adequate, and he was allowed to enroll for the course.
<P>
Also at the recollective-analytic level fall the examples of renewed
spiritual inspiration from reading of sacred literature. Biblical
passages or religious terms formerly meaningless sometimes acquire
vivid meanings for many readers. Like the individual who through
conversion experience suddenly finds himself in possession of
the meaning of the term &quot;salvation,&quot; so the LSD subject
may find similar terms illuminated for him (Leary and Clark, 1963
) .
<P>
An example may be cited of an individual who found significant
meaning in a biblical passage during a session with morning-glory
seeds:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Upon opening my eyes, I found that I was facing the bookcase.
The first book that I perceived was the Holy Bible. I seized it
and flung it open. Strangely, the smooth, burnished pages felt
like human skin. I fondled, kissed, and caressed the pages. For
the first time in several hours, I had found some degree of tranquillity
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I looked at the page I had selected and found that my finger was
directly above Ezekiel 11:24. The words of this verse, as well
as the one directly following it, described my liberation from
the more terrifying aspects of the psychedelic experience as well
as the importance of communicating my experience to others. They
read, &quot;Then the vision that I had seen went up from me. And
I told the exiles all the things that the Lord had showed me.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As I read on, I found a new interpretation for the twelfth chapter
of Ezekiel. The prophet spoke of a &quot;rebellious house&quot;
and of people---perhaps in need of psychedelic substances---who
have &quot;ears to hear and hear not.&quot; The injunction of
Ezekiel 12:13 is to &quot;eat your bread with quaking, and drink
water with trembling,&quot; an appropriate description of the
consumption of psychedelics. Ezekiel 12:23-24 states that &quot;the
days are at hand and the fulfillment of every vision.&quot; Everything
I read under the spell of the morning-glory seeds became directed
toward the psychedelic experience.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Once again, in this instance, there was an integration of the
act of reading into the ongoing psychedelic experience. As a result,
a number of &quot;connections&quot; were discovered that would
have eluded the subject had he not ingested morning-glory seeds.
This phenomenon is surprisingly common among frequent LSD users;
their belief in the direct interrelations among most of the events
of their lives may well influence their behavior and their view
of the universe.
<P>
The reading process is rarely associated with the third or fourth
levels of psychedelic experience, but some individuals have been
catapulted into a deeply moving symbolic or integral episode following
a chance glimpse of a line of Hebrew script or of an Egyptian
hieroglyphic. In other cases, a line of print has occurred at
the end of a segment of the experience and has seemed to summarize
it. One subject reported such an episode at the symbolic level
during a mescaline session:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I was propelled back into time, back into the primeval jungle.
I saw two savages stalking each other in the underbrush. Each
savage carried a bow and arrow. Each was prepared to kill the
other upon sight. Blood was on their minds- murder was in their
hearts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Suddenly, each saw the other. Each gasped in surprise. Each dropped
his bow. The two bows fell together on the ground, forming a mandala.
The arrows fell upon the mandala, dividing it into four sections.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The savages fell upon each other---but in an embrace rather than
in an assault. As they strolled into the jungle to enjoy their
newly discovered companionship, the mandala turned into a white
button. Upon the button, in red and blue, appeared the words,
&quot;Make love, not war.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
During one of my own psilocybin experiences I had an unusual visualization.
I pictured a whirlwind carrying away all the words, letters, numbers,
and verbal symbols that had acculturated and conditioned me throughout
the years. One might say that my session was a form of non- verbal
training, a dramatic confrontation with naked events that reminded
me not only of the awareness encountered among preliterate tribes,
but also of Alfred Korzybski's writings in the field of general
semantics ( 1933 ) .
<P>
Korzybski considered man's consciousness of the abstraction process
to be the most effective safeguard against semantic problems (such
as confusing words with objects) and the key to further human
evolution. Consciousness of abstraction was defined by Korzybski
as an &quot;awareness that in our process of abstracting we have
<I>left out</I> characteristics.&quot; An individual apprehends
himself and his world fully and accurately to the degree that
he continually translates higher-order abstractions back to the
level of concrete experience. An individual is &quot;sane&quot;
to the extent that he becomes experientially aware of the discrepancy
between conceptualization and sense impressions. Developmentally,
man (both as a species and as an individual) progresses from the
preliterate stage (in which he is enmeshed in concrete experience)
to the early literate stage (in which he confuses words with things
and becomes split off from non-verbal reality) to a fully developed
literate stage (in which he uses the printed word but does not
confuse it with the object for which it stands).
<P>
Robert Mogar (1965c) has stated that, at its best, the psychedelic
state can permit the individual to evaluate with some detachment
both the structure of his semantic framework (i.e., its similarity
to reality) and his semantic reactions. These two kinds of learning
were strongly recommended by Korzybski as the most effective means
of increasing one's consciousness of the abstracting process.
<P>
Richard Marsh (1965) has described how, under LSD, &quot;we seem
to come up against that part of our inner world where meanings
are made, where the patterning process operates in its pure form.&quot;
He has further noted that, semantically, the condition of being
absolutely present to the outer and the inner reality has at least
two advantages. First, it allows a person to tune in on that feedback,
both external and internal, that enables him to correct his own
errors in encoding. He is able to reduce the noise level in the
various communication systems in which he is involved by re-encoding
his message streams until they convey the meanings that he intends
them to convey. Secondly, it allows a person to inhabit the world
of the actual, the world of fact, instead of the unreal and empty
world of the prefabricated abstraction. It allows him to experience
the world instead of merely to think about it, and perhaps to
begin to live in it at last.
<P>
Marsh's claim that a new level of reality is opened up by the
psychedelics is a controversial one. It is a further step in the
perpetual dialogue concerning language and reality. As long as
men have reflected about their world, this basic issue has divided
them. Some men have regarded man's language as a straightforward
reflection of reality. Others have looked upon language as a reducing
valve imposed by the limitations of man's consciousness upon the
unlimited varieties of his internal and external world (Krippner,
1965). Aldous Huxley (1959, p. 22) has described the role that
verbal and written symbols play in helping mankind to utilize
this limited consciousness:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To formulate and express the contents of this reduced awareness
man has invented and endlessly elaborated those symbol-systems
and implicit philosophies which we call languages. Every individual
is at once the beneficiary and the victim of the linguistic tradition
into which he or she has been born---the beneficiary inasmuch
as language gives access to the accumulated records of other people's
experience, the victim insofar as it confirms him in the belief
that reduced awareness is the only awareness and as it bedevils
his sense of reality so that he is all too apt to take his concepts
for data, his words for actual things.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The psychedelic session as non-verbal training represents a method
by which an individual can attain a higher level of linguistic
maturity and sophistication. On the other hand, some psychedelic
episodes have been reported in which an apparent regression took
place, in which language was concretized-the letters becoming
transformed into images and objects. One subject, while smoking
marijuana, looked at a magazine cover and reported a concretization
experience:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The magazine featured a picture story about Mexico, and the cover
featured large letters spelling out the name of that country.
As I looked at the letters, they turned into Aztec men and women.
They retained their shape as letters, but subtle shades and shadows
became eyes, heads, arms, and legs. That part wasn't so bad, but
when Atzecs began to move across the page, I quickly turned the
magazine over!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The concretization of letters has been put to artistic use by
illustrators throughout the centuries (Mahlow, 1963). For example,
Ferdinand Kriwet designed a mandala composed of nothing but several
hundred capital letters. Joshua Reichert produced another mandala
that consisted of several types of script. A number of contemporary
poster artists have publicized &quot;acid rock&quot; musical performances
by producing advertisements that fuse the letters with the pictures,
making the names of such groups as &quot;The Grateful Dead&quot;
and &quot;The Byrds&quot; an integral part of the over-all design,
thus combining the &quot;medium&quot; and the &quot;message.&quot;
The &quot;psychedelic poster&quot; has, within a few years, become
an original art form (Masters and Houston, 1968).
<P>
The variety of effects that psychedelics have upon receptive language
functioning have at least one factor in common: they point up
the role that language as a &quot;connecting system&quot; plays
in verbal memory (Hastings, 1967). Electric brain stimulation
and hypnosis have been able to retrieve long-forgotten memories;
psychedelic drugs often produce similar effects, especially at
those periods of time when subjects are at the recollective-analytic
level.
<P>
Physical shock and psychic trauma often lead to the forgetting
of verbal material or a regression in verbal functioning. In these
cases, the &quot;connecting system&quot; breaks down, just as
it does in certain episodes with psychedelics. Henri Michaux (1967)
has stated, &quot;After an average dose of hashish, one is unfit
for reading.&quot; Other artists and writers, however, say that
they appreciate receptive language (e.g., listening to poetry,
reading novels ) even more when they are &quot;high.&quot; A great
deal of research is needed to explore the variables that determine
what effects psychedelics have upon language as it connects one's
past memory with his present experience.
<H4>Expressive Language</H4>

<P>
A number of investigators have reported a reduction or even an
absence of speech among LSD subjects. Some writers have suggested
that these drugs suppress activity in the cortical levels of the
brain, where the speech centers are located. J. H. Von Felsinger
and his associates (1956), for example, noted that there was &quot;a
slowing down of speech and expression&quot; with their LSD subjects,
none of whom were psychiatric patients. On the other hand, Morgens
Hertz, a Danish physician, described a patient whose long-standing
stuttering condition disappeared following LSD treatment (Stafford
&amp; Golightly, 1967, p. 113). An American team of researchers
found that schizophrenic children became more communicative following
LSD treatment ( Bender, Goldschmidt, and Siva Sankar, 1956). As
with the other types of language, the alteration of expressive
language under LSD can take a variety of forms, depending on how
it happens to mesh with other aspects of the psychedelic experience.
<P>
One research team (Lennard, Jarvik, and Abramson, 1956) studied
the effects of LSD on group communication, using both an experimental
group of subjects and a control group. The subjects in the control
group increased their verbal output during the observation period,
while among those who had taken LSD there was a reduction in word
output. In addition, the subjects who took LSD asked more questions
and made more statements pertaining to orientation (e.g., &quot;What's
happening?&quot; &quot;Where am I?&quot;) than those in the control
group. These findings are consistent with the typical reactions
of subjects at the sensory level when traditional timespace orientation
is lost.
<P>
Another reason for reduced verbalization during psychedelic sessions
may be the presence of visual imagery. When an individual becomes
involved in &quot;the retinal circus,&quot; he often loses interest
in speaking. Finally, relaxation and lethargy often mark a subject's
first experiences with the psychedelics. In these instances, the
speech muscles would be inoperative, and verbalization would be
reduced still further.
<P>
E. S. Tauber and M. R. Green (1959) have discussed the difficulty
in talking about visual imagery and trying to communicate it to
someone else. Not only is there difficulty in translating one's
own private world into meaningful public symbols, but there is
also a kaleidoscopic piling up of many different images and meanings.
Speech is the vocal expression of one's experiences and feelings
in verbal symbols; wherever communication involves much more than
language can adequately express, there is a high probability of
serious gaps, misunderstandings, and improper inferences. Tauber
and Green have stated, &quot;. . . the communication of dream
material perhaps most strikingly illustrates the weakness of the
tool of language.&quot; Much the same could be said of psychedelic
experience at the sensory level; this may be another reason why
speech often is reduced during a subject's initial LSD experiences.
<P>
The description of visual imagery is not the only communication
problem that faces the LSD initiate. At the sensory level, there
is often an increased awareness of bodily feelings. Preliterate
tribes paid great attention to these feelings, but the American
culture generally ignores them, unless they are unpleasant. Those
words that most quickly come to mind during periods of acute bodily
awareness are &quot;sick to my stomach,&quot; &quot;pains in my
back,&quot; and &quot;nagging headache.&quot; Once these words
become linked to what may be quite natural (and potentially pleasurable
) sensations, an individual may very well get sick, regurgitate,
and interpret the rest of his psychedelic session as unpleasant.
<P>
It is in this regard that the work of Russell Mason on internal
perception ( 1961) assumes importance. Although Mason's experiments
did not involve psychedelic drugs, they could serve as models
for what can eventually be done with such substances. He asked
subjects to specify where various kinds of feelings were located.
Love and friendliness, for example, were associated with the central
chest area, sexual feelings with the genital-pubic area. He concluded,
&quot;. . . the ability of the individual to permit <I>immediate
awareness</I> of . . . non-cognitive internal perceptions appears
to be necessary for healthy psychological adjustment.&quot; His
data offer a possible physiological explanation for the body changes
that take place when drug subjects report feelings of &quot;oceanic
love&quot; or &quot;strong sexual responses.&quot; They also suggest
that persons who are unable to allow this immediate awareness
to take place may be poor risks for LSD sessions.
<P>
Masters and Houston (1966) have reported statements from a number
of subjects who purportedly &quot;felt&quot; the interior of the
body during psychedelic experiments. One subject told about sensing
his &quot;interior landscape,&quot; describing the &quot;trees,
vines, streams, waterfalls, hills, and valleys&quot; of the body.
Another described the sensation of blood flowing through his veins
as well as the receiving and transmitting operations of the nervous
system. All these reports characterize the first, or sensory,
level of psychedelic experience.
<P>
The verbal reports associated with the recollective-analytic and
symbolic levels are somewhat different. For example, one subject
at the recollective-analytic level reported the insight to Masters
and Houston, &quot;I have never been in love with my own body.
In fact, I believe that a major emotional problem in my life is
that I have always disliked it.&quot; At the symbolic level, a
number of subjects experience bodily sensations in terms of a
mythic drama. One anthropologist reported going through a Haitian
transformation rite in which his body began to take on aspects
of a tiger ( Masters and Houston, 966, pp.76-78).
<P>
At the integral level, bodily sensations are also reported. One
of Masters and Houston's subjects had a mystical experience in
which he was &quot;. . . overwhelmed by a bombardment of physical
sensations, by tangible sound waves both felt and seen,&quot;
after which he &quot;dissolved.&quot; He later stated, &quot;Now
I understand what is meant by being a part of everything, what
is meant by sensing the body as dissolving.&quot;
<P>
A great deal of research is needed to correlate the data on bodily
sensations with the data on LSD. One important hypothetical formulation
that would be helpful in effecting this correlation was presented
by Gardner Murphy and Sidney Cohen in 1965. Murphy and Cohen suggested
that psychedelic drugs lower the threshold for internal sensations,
especially those from the digestive system, the sex organs, and
the striped muscles. As a result, body feelings emerge into self-consciousness,
and an individual may interpret the experience as one of &quot;cosmic
love.&quot; Murphy and Cohen also hypothesized that there was
a direct relationship between certain physiological sensations
and such verbal reports as &quot;entrance into the void.&quot;
<P>
In considering the effects of psychedelic substances upon speech,
attention could be paid not only to the physiological determinants
but to the psychological concomitants of the experience. One of
the most typical phenomena is the statement by the subject that
his experience has been ineffable, that it cannot be communicated
adequately to others. Some subjects assert that no words exist
to describe internal events such as those they have felt, and
that even if there were such words they would be devoid of significance
unless the listener himself had gone through the same experiences.
Richard Blum (1964) reported one man's reaction:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Really, when I first took LSD, I didn't know how to describe what
had happened. It was intense and important, very much so, but
there were no words for it. But after talking with others who
had taken it I could see that they were talking about the same
thing. They did have words for it---&quot;transcendental&quot;
was one---and so I started using those words myself. An interesting
thing happened to my wife. After I gave her LSD she said very
little about it. For a whole month she hardly said a word about
her experience. But then I introduced her to some others who were
taking the drug, and it wasn't more than a few days before she
started talking a blue streak; you see, she'd learned how to talk
about it from them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This explanation describes how one learns a language that signifies
to other users that one understands and has been through a psychedelic
experience. According to Blum, the language is shaped by the culture
of the speakers-in this case by the particular subgroup with which
the LSD user is socially affiliated and under whose auspices he
has taken the drug. This language is as much a sign of &quot;togetherness&quot;
and &quot;belongingness&quot; as it is a device for communicating
the content of an experience. It is not unusual that a number
of people in drug subcultures become frustrated when talking with
non-users; to the individual who has never undergone psychedelic
experience, the user's words are not understood as affirmations
that one is a particular kind of person or a fellow member of
an important in-group.
<P>
Blum has maintained that learning the LSD language and vocalizing
the philosophy of the psychedelic subculture are steps in the
commitment of an individual to an identifiable group. Language,
in this instance, becomes a device to provide structure and to
create a community of experience among persons who have had LSD.
Furthermore, whatever one expects from the psychedelics on the
basis of prior information and personal predispositions strongly
influences the choice of words later used to describe the experience
itself.
<P>
The experience of being taught linguistic terminology by members
of the drug subculture is more than instruction in communication.
It is instruction in approved words and approved experiences;
it is instruction in a point of view. The terms that are learned
can be used to structure the pharmacological response to a drug,
giving the experience sense and meaning that it may not otherwise
have had. After his first trip, a novice might be told, &quot;Oh
yes, from what you say I can tell you really did have a transcendental
experience.&quot; Such comments are not only instructive, helping
the person define and describe his response, but they are also
approving and rewarding. As experiments on conditioned behavior
have demonstrated, rewarded behavior is generally repeated. In
the case of illegal LSD use, the rewards---often linguistic in
nature---are frequently great enough to overshadow such potential
hazards as psychosis, suicide, and chromosomal damage.
<P>
Regarding legal experimental use of the psychedelics, it has often
been observed that the language used by the guide will influence
what the subject says later to describe his session. This observation
is borne out by some of the early research studies. It was initially
believed that LSD produced psychotic reactions, and the drug was
termed &quot;psychotomimetic&quot; by psychiatrists and psychologists
(Rinkel, 1956). LSD subjects were sometimes told by the physician
administering the drug, &quot;You probably will go out of your
mind for several hours&quot;; many subjects later reported terrifying
experiences. One early experimenter took verbatim recordings of
an interview with an LSD subject and of an interview with a schizophrenic
subject, and outside judges could not distinguish which of the
two was suffering from schizophrenia. (Hoffer, 1956).
<P>
As research workers became more knowledgeable, the psychotomimetic
label was discarded by many investigators. Pollard, Uhr, and Stern
(1965) noted that psychotic disorders are characterized &quot;by
personality disintegration and failure to test and evaluate correctly
external reality in various spheres.&quot; Following the conclusion
of their work with LSD, they stated, &quot;In none of the normal
experimental subjects to whom we have given these drugs, nor in
our own experience, could these criteria be satisfied.&quot;
<P>
The problem of scientific scrutiny of verbal reports made during
psychedelic sessions persists. One promising tool for linguistic
analysis is the measure devised by Bernard Aaronson (1955) for
the examination of verbal behavior in psychotherapy. Using standardized
measures of word complexity, Aaronson found that, as psychological
stress is alleviated, word complexity increases. Another research
tool is that used at the Maimonides Dream Laboratory to divide
spoken dream reports into units of meaning (Malamud et al., 1967).
As the typical subject in experimental dream studies has little
concern for grammatical formalism when he makes his verbal report,
this method determines units of meaning to be analyzed with regard
to dream content.
<P>
Using the Cloze procedure to study grammatical predictability,
Cheek and Amarel (1968) administered LSD to ten alcoholics, and
analyzed their speech patterns. It was found that grammatical
predictability tended to rise as the alcoholics continued to speak,
both in the drug and non-drug conditions. A group of ten schizophrenics
was also studied in the non-drug condition; their grammatical
predictability tended to drop.
<P>
In another study (Katz, Waskow, and Olsson, 1968), a group of
sixty-nine convicts were administered LSD, amphetamine, and placebos.
The subjects receiving LSD were found to be significantly different
from the other subjects regarding a number of effects, including
language. LSD subjects in general were described as &quot;giggly&quot;;
the more-dysphoric subjects spoke little and slowly, the ambivalent
subjects spoke a great deal and rapidly, while the euphoric subjects
fell in the middle regarding speech behavior.
<P>
Charles Dahlberg, Stanley Feldstein, and Joseph Jaffee (1968)
are in the process of making a detailed analysis of the verbal
reports of psychoneurotic patients during twenty-two therapy sessions.
Before each session, the patient ingested between fifty and one
hundred micrograms of LSD. The therapy sessions were spaced over
a period of eighteen months.
<P>
The patients' verbal reports were transferred to IBM punch cards
and are being submitted to several techniques of linguistic analysis.
One such technique, the Role Construct Sorting Procedure, is a
test to measure changes in the way patients conceptualize people
who are important in their lives. Moreover, these measurements
of change are themselves being analyzed for indications of increased
and expanded associations on the part of the patients.
<P>
In addition, the Cloze procedure, an index of redundancy, is being
used as a measurement of the predictability of interpersonal language
in the patient-therapist interchange. The Type-Token Ratio is
a measure of vocabulary diversity and, indirectly, an indicator
of the informational structure of speech. Finally, nurses who
attended the patients after each session have rated the patients
as to speech patterns, periods of silence, periods of withdrawal,
mood swings, etc.
<P>
Preliminary results indicate that LSD facilitates treatment of
early experiences in patients by producing partial regression.
In addition, LSD appears to increase the patients' ability to
evaluate their problems clearly and to communicate their insights
to the psychotherapist with facility.
<P>
Written language attempts to convey meaning through printed symbols.
Although S. Weir Mitchell (1896), one of the first to write a
description of a psychedelic experience, stated that his peyote
experience was &quot;. . . hopeless to describe in language,&quot;
he later managed to describe &quot;. . . stars, delicate floating
films of color, then an abrupt rush of countless points of white
light [that] swept across the field of view, as if the unseen
millions of the Milky Way were to flow in a sparkling river before
my eyes.&quot; His account was sufficiently vivid for Trouton
and Eysenck (1961) to be able to suggest that he substituted primitive
thinking in the form of visual images for conceptual thought.
<P>
While at the sensory level, during his first LSD experience, a
subject attempted to write an account of his subjective reactions,
but became fascinated with the very act of writing itself:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Amazing! Amazing! The fluidity of the panorama of the room! It
seems like eons of time pass between each letter when I write
it. As I write, I see the loops, the dots, etc., spiral off the
page in colors. Off to infinity!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
At the recollective-analytic level, imagery persists but conceptualization
is often possible as well. For example, Thomas Ling and John Buckman
(1963) have reported the case of a European writer who overcame
&quot;writer's block&quot; through LSD therapy. Prior to taking
LSD, he had been unable to finish a manuscript. After LSD therapy,
he went on to become one of the leading authors in Germany. His
major work completed during the time he was in therapy, was translated
into twelve languages and had a wide audience in the Western world.
The writer concluded:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am no longer afraid of putting one letter after the other to
say what I want.... I seem capable of expressing what many people
would love to express but for which they cannot find the words.
I did not find the words before, because I tried to avoid saying
the essential things.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Material that emerges at the recollective-analytic level does
not always lead to the well- being of the subject, especially
if the drugs are taken in unsupervised sessions and with an absence
of preparation. Following an LSD session, a college student wrote
the following account of his experience at the recollective-analytic
level:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Apparently some sort of love-making was going on in the other
room because the guide would not let me enter it. As it turned
out, this was the wrong thing to do, because it started me on
the road to paranoia, panic, and &quot;the depths.&quot; His refusal
to let me enter the room aroused my suspicions of an ulterior
motive. I picked one which I have a curious fear of: homosexuality.
I was unwilling to submit to what became suggestive words, lewd
actions, and a depraved smile. I shudder when I recall it. My
fear was not of the act but that if I submitted I would become
&quot;one of them&quot;-&quot;them&quot; being an indefinite but
evil sort of being with a depraved smile-and never able to &quot;return.&quot;
It reminds me of the movie &quot;The Pod People,&quot; where &quot;people&quot;
are grown in pods and substituted for real people. You don't know
if your best friend is one of these &quot;people&quot; dedicated
to your destruction or conversion until it is too late.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Because of the pathological elements in this written description,
the student was advised by several people to do no more drug experimentation.
However, about a year later, the student accepted a friend's invitation
to smoke marijuana. The session began with a number of pleasant
bodily feelings and unusual perceptual impressions. Suddenly,
the student became obsessed with the notion that his friend desired
to have sexual relations with him. The student's friend called
the police, and the student was rushed to a hospital, having entered
a serious psychotic episode<A NAME="back2"></A>. <A HREF="#footnote2">(2)</A>
In this tragic instance, the student's written account could have
served as a predictor of what would likely happen during future
sessions.
<P>
An individual attempting to write descriptions of psychedelic
experience at the symbolic level has the difficult job of choosing
verbal terms that convey some sense of his mythic encounters.
This formidable task was well handled by an attorney in the following
way (Masters and Houston, 1966, pp. 221-22 ):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I saw Jesus crucified and Peter martyred. I watched the early
Christians die in the arena while others moved hurriedly through
the Roman back streets, spreading Christ's doctrine. I stood by
when Constantine gaped at the vision of the cross in the sky.
I saw Rome fall and the Dark Ages begin, and observed as little
crossed twigs were tacked up as the only hope in ten thousand
wretched hovels. I watched peasants trample it under their feet
in some obscene forest rite, while, across the sea in Byzantium,
they glorified it in jeweled mosaics and great domed cathedrals.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The attorney's written description is imaginative, yet fairly
concrete, just as the mythical world is concrete. The linguistic
consciousness of primitive man is non-abstract; its concreteness
is marked by a concrescence of name and thing (as exemplified
by the various types of name taboos). Ernst Cassirer (1955) has
noted that in some primitive religions the worshiper did not dare
to utter the name of his gods; in others, certain words were used
for the purpose of hex and voodoo. This concrescence of name and
thing is demonstrated by a subject's report of a peyote session:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The guide asked me how I felt, and I responded &quot;Good.&quot;
As I uttered the word &quot;Good,&quot; I could see it form visually
in the air. It was pink and fluffy, like a cloud. The word looked
&quot;good&quot; in its appearance and so it had to be &quot;Good.&quot;
The word and the thing I was trying to express were one, and &quot;Good&quot;
was floating around in the air.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Name and thing are often wedded at the recollective-analytic and
the symbolic levels. A subject will say the word &quot;Mother&quot;
and feel that the word itself contains aspects of his own mother---or
of his memories of her. A theology student will say &quot;Logos&quot;
and imagine that God and Christ are both present within the word.
Only after the drug's effects begin to wear off can these individuals
tear the words apart from the experience.
<P>
As with other language processes, psychedelic substances can affect
the act of writing by bringing about a regressive-type phenomenon
(in which words and experience are united, as they often are with
the child and with the primitive tribesman) or else improve the
process (by removing &quot;writer's block,&quot; facilitating
verbal expression, etc.) . In some cases both occur, as when a
writer engages in concrescence of word and thing at the symbolic
or integral level and later presents a vivid written description
of that experience.
<P>
To assist the encoding of psychedelic experience, an &quot;experimental
typewriter&quot; has been invented by Ogden Lindsley and William
Getzinger (Leary, 1966a). The typewriter has twenty pens, any
of which can be depressed by the subject to describe his ongoing
experience. The subject must be trained in the use of the device
and must learn the code that assists him to describe his psychedelic
sensations and reactions. For example, the first key is depressed
whenever bodily sensations are experienced; the third key is depressed
when feelings about other people are experienced. Although further
refinement of this device is needed, the research possibilities
seem extensive. A subject could tap out a second-by-second sequence
of his experiences, and communicate them at least in general terms.
Experience patterns could be correlated with neurological recordings.
A guide could keep a close watch on the subject's reactions should
it be felt advisable to modify the experience.
<P>
In one first-person report (Roseman, 1966), a subject claimed
that he learned how to become a skilled typist by means of psychedelic
experience. Instead of emphasizing the more ideational aspects
of the writing process, the subject concentrated on sheer motor
activity. First, he familiarized himself with the keyboard and
learned the proper fingering techniques. To reinforce the matching
of fingers and typewriter keys, he took LSD, began to type, and
continued for several hours.
<P>
This subject's claims regarding a facilitation in motor function
are provocative and need to be explored under controlled conditions.
Peter Laurie (1967) has suggested that the act of writing may
be feasible under light doses of psychedelic substances but, for
most people, impossible under heavy doses. In the case of writing,
therefore, one is struck by the same variety of reports as one
encounters with other forms of language; certain people under
certain conditions claim that their writing functions are enhanced,
others assert writing is impaired, and still others report no
discernible difference.
<H4>Conclusion</H4>

<P>
The emergence of professional and public interest in psychedelic
substances coincides with the shift in human communication from
the chirographic-typographic to the electronic stage. Just as
electronic devices have begun to &quot;re-tribalize&quot; the
world and convey a sense of simultaneity to human experience,
so the LSD user often engages in mythic episodes, senses a &quot;unity
of all peoples,&quot; and has an impression that everything is
happening &quot;all at once&quot;-in a nonlinear manner.
<P>
Psychedelic substances, when they affect language processes, sometimes
appear to assist an individual to observe the difference between
the word and the object it represents. In this way, the drugs
may serve as catalysts in a non-verbal training program, helping
the subject translate verbal abstractions in terms of direct experience.
<P>
Psychedelic substances can produce the opposite result as well.
The subject may revert to primitive thinking, his ability to conceptualize
may decrease, and he may effect a union between the word and its
object. This is exemplified by the concretization of letters into
pictures and images, by the concrescence of verbalizations with
the items they represent, and by the use of words in magical ways
on the part of several LSD subjects.
<P>
In other words, any of the human race's communicative stages-voice-and-ear,
chirographic-typographic, electronic- may be observed by the researcher
during a round of psychedelic sessions. Therefore, psychedelic
drugs offer an unparalleled opportunity for the investigation
of human language processes. The few experimental and clinical
reports that exist in the fields of listening, reading, speaking,
and writing differ so greatly as to inspire curiosity as to the
reasons that the same drugs can produce varied effects at different
dosage levels, with different individuals, and under different
conditions. An extremely important variable seems to be whether
or not language, either receptive or expressive, becomes integrated
with the ongoing psychedelic experience. If the integration occurs,
an improvement in function will often occur. If the connection
is not made, language functioning may deteriorate or become blocked
altogether.
<P>
At the sensory level, words are encoded and decoded in highly
unusual ways. At the recollective-analytic level, language often
serves as a &quot;connecting system&quot; in memory and interpretation.
At the symbolic level, words often become part of a mythic or
historical ritual. At the integral level, language rarely is a
part of the immediate experience; however, many writers and poets
have effectively transformed their religious or mystical episodes
into words.
<P>
A permanent state of altered consciousness is neither practical
nor desirable. However, the individual may return to the world
of imprinting, conditioning, acculturation, and verbalization
with new insights if his psychedelic session has been properly
guided. The research possibilities in the field of language and
the psychedelics are immense. The data obtained by imaginative
and responsible investigators may well point the way to an enhancement
of creative functioning and a better understanding of the human
potential.<P><HR WIDTH=50%>

(2) When I interviewed the student, I discovered that no antidote
had been given him once he entered the hospital. Instead, he was
queried by policemen, who insisted on knowing the names of campus
marijuana and LSD users. This type of treatment, in which the
well-being of the patient is relegated to a secondary status by
law enforcement personnel, has become very common as the general
public's fear of psychedelics has increased. <A HREF="#back2">(back)</A>

<H3>The Acid Queen</H3>
<H4>by Robert Hunter</H4>
<P>
Chapter 7 of <I>The Storming of the Mind</I><BR>McClelland and Stewart
Ltd., &copy;Robert Hunter, 1971<P><HR>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The human mind cannot be conceived of as a glass or window through
which information passes without bending or being distorted. Rather,
external phenomena are filtered through a preexisting structure.
This structure itself is shaped by experience and conditioning
and expectations which are themselves, to varying degrees, learned.
This filter&#151;or &quot;reticular system,&quot; as it is more precisely
called&#151;discriminates. It accepts and rejects information, sifting
through the daily barrage of sensory input like a kind of organic
pre-programmed computer. The philosopher, J. Bronowski, has written
about what he calls the &quot;interlocked picture of the world&quot;
which the brain constructs. This picture is <I>not</I> the way
the world looks but rather our way of looking at it. All perceptions,
after having been picked up by the senses, are graded (interviewed,
if you like) and screened by the reticular system before being
forwarded to the mind.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Accordingly, we automatically distinguish between what our experience
has told us is relevant and what is irrelevant&#151;or nonfunctional.
This filter is itself shaped by the environment in which the individual
finds himself. The signals and messages he chooses to pick up
are those he has been trained to categorize as being of some importance
to his survival. Others will be deflected. Accordingly, it is
not the &quot;eye&quot; of the artist which permits him to detect
nuances where the non-artist will see nothing&#151;it is simply that
the artist will not automatically screen out information which,
to the other, is of no value or importance.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It is likely that LSD attacks this filter, rendering it more porous,
opening up tunnels which would otherwise remain sealed. The effects
of LSD are therefore of deep significance. One's reticular system
is finally the product of one's whole cultural milieu. No culture
could ever remain &quot;intact&quot; if the mental filters of
its members were not synchronized with the larger, more generalized
cultural filter. When LSD disrupts the functioning of the filter,
it removes the individual from this over-all cultural context.
It drives him not &quot;out of his mind,&quot; but out of the
<I>filter</I> surrounding his mind.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
On the basis of its morality, priorities, prejudices, goals, ideals,
and fears, any given society will roughly impress a similar set
of mental reflexes on its members. Thus, people who grow up in
a given society tend strongly to agree upon certain concepts basic
to the structure of the society. Depending upon the technology
and philosophy of the society, its degree of sophistication, their
views will be approximately representative. And to the extent
that the society is incapable of achieving some kind to overview&#151;of
transcending its own nature, its own habits, its own assumptions&#151;so
too will the perceptions of the individual be limited and inhibited.
The cultural point of view, which is converted into a perceptual
method, is internalized, and each individual becomes a walking
micro-culture. Any device or system which tends to break down
the structure of the individual micro-culture assaults, in the
most direct and specific way possible, the very foundations of
the overculture, the partial and culturally-limited point of view-which
members of a given society share, if they are to have any common
impulse or behavior pattern at all. Or, more to the point, if
they are to be controlled, managed, organized, or led.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
A Czech doctor once said that LSD inhibits conditioned reflexes.
To the extent that it does that, it removes the individual from
the context of his culture. It takes him-however temporarily away
from the familiar board, renders the normal rules of the game
useless, and opens him up to a radically-altered perception.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To a lesser degree, regardless of the differences in the chemical
process whereby the effect is achieved, this is also the secret
of marijuana, hashish, peyote and so on: not really that they
&quot;expand&quot; the mind, but that they widen the doors of
perception, as Aldous Huxley said, sometimes just slightly, although
at other times not only is the door (the preconditioned mental
filter) knocked right down, but a whole wall may be demolished,
and sensory data previously blocked out comes pouring in. One
stands exposed, literally, to the elements, suddenly naked.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Few cultures have ever had as much of a vested interest in compartmentalized
perception as technological society. Specialization insists upon
informing individuals deeply but narrowly. And the <I>organization</I>
of specialists from different fields has become the key to technological
success. The &quot;partial and culturally limited point of view&quot;
which has grown up in the West takes its shape mainly from the
incubators of Aristotelian logic, Christian dualism and the concept
of length. These great formative roots have in common an insistence
upon division and fragmentation. Aristotelianism gave us a subject-predicate
language, &quot;with its tendency to treat objects as in isolation
and to have no place for relations.&quot; Christianity, of course,
insists upon the theology of God and the Devil, absolute Good
and absolute Evil, Heaven and Hell, the Spirit and the Flesh.
We have already noted the effects of the concept of length. Together,
they provide the conceptual blueprint for the Western psyche&#151;a
blueprint the outline of which has been blurred by electronic
media, physics and the tremendous insights offered by Gestalt
therapy and general semantics, but which remains nevertheless
the operative design.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It is worth noting, as several writers have pointed out, that
what is existentially astonishing about the LSD experience is
the &quot;discovery&quot; that, mentally, most of us have been
operating within the confines of a quite narrow and sharply restricted
level of consciousness. The dualistic image of the world, which
is our culturally limited way of viewing things, is &quot;real&quot;
only along the avenues of this one wavelength of consciousness.
It is the Oneness of the universe which becomes apparent once
the dualistic image to which the reticular system is harnessed
has been dissolved or broken down. Again, this discovery can be
made through less potent (and dangerous) drugs. <I>It can also
be made without recourse to drugs at all.</I> For the consciousness
which the drug experience offers is not unique; it is not &quot;new&quot;;
it is not unnatural; there is nothing &quot;freaky&quot; or &quot;far-out&quot;
or weird about it all, except in the context of contemporary society.
<B>The fact that such a holistic consciousness should be seen
as being irrational reveals nothing except the degree to which
Western civilization itself has become unnatural and freaky. </B>[emphasis
added, ed.]
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
What do you &quot;see&quot; while stoned, whether on pot or acid
or any other &quot;hallucinogen,&quot; that isn't already apparent
to a mind not locked in a conceptual cage? The attraction felt
by drug-users for ancient Oriental philosophies and religions
is no mere coincidence. Through their drug experiences they have
come to see a reality not split by Aristotelian logic or Christian
dualism or operationalism. They see things as they were always
seen long before the concrete perceptual foundations of the West
were poured. The &quot;culturally-limited&quot; point of view
stamped upon generations of Europeans and their colonizing children
is suddenly seen, through the medium of drugs, to be the product
of a &quot;narrow and restricted level of consciousness.&quot;
To those minds most conditioned by the Western version of consciousness,
the attitudes induced by drugs seem appallingly regressive: the
idea that &quot;primitives&quot; and &quot;savages&quot; and &quot;barbarians&quot;
and &quot;heathens&quot; might have had a better grasp of reality
than their white conquerors does not go down well. It makes white
supremacy a cruel joke. It makes what we have been conditioned
to think of as &quot;civilization&quot; something very close to
a farce. Just incidentally, it renders every established political
context meaningless, at least as meaningless as the artificial
contexts established by economics.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The real fear behind the generally hostile reaction to drugs is
that the insights offered by these drugs might be more valid than
the insights offered by established authority, that what is called
&quot;hallucination&quot; and &quot;illusion&quot; might in fact
be a greater (wider, deeper, more profound) perception of reality
than the ordinary. Suppose that while stoned you <I>do</I> see
things more clearly and directly. Suppose that ordinary (that
is, culturally-conditioned) perception is something like partial
blindness, imperfect, distorted, incomplete. And now allow just
the <I>possibility</I> that drugs might open your eyes wider,
that you might be able through the medium of drugs to perceive
things in a more complete manner, that you might be able to activate
repressed or dormant perceptual faculties within yourself....
Immediately, one can appreciate the threat these drugs represent
to the established order. It is an order dominated by people who
have learned the tricks of surviving and flourishing inside it.
If it may be thought of as an elaborate machine, it is a machine
which some people have learned to operate, and these people, naturally,
have risen to positions of power based on their ability to operate
the controls. They understand this machine. They have a mechanic's
love of its familiar intricacies. <I>Anything</I> which suggests
the existence of another, more complex and pervasive machine,
one whose functioning is not understood by the people who have
learned to work the old machine (or reality) is threatening to
them in the extreme. If a greater reality emerges and claims the
minds of men, what becomes of the lesser reality? It will be consigned,
inevitably, to the garbage heap. And with it, also inevitably,
will go all those who depended on it for their power and authority.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The fear of drugs is deep-rooted, but it has nothing to do with
worries over whether young minds might be corrupted or ruined
or that people will get intoxicated; after all, alcohol is not
so feared. As for fear of young minds being ruined or somehow
&quot;lost&quot; to society, this is at the very least a transparent
rationalization. If the danger of &quot;losing&quot; young citizens
was the authentic cause of the reaction to drugs, then automobiles
would be far more loathed and hated than pot or acid. Who can
argue that the automobile does not claim more young &quot;minds&quot;
(along with their bodies) every weekend in North America than
do drugs in a year? No, the parent who will turn the keys to his
car over to his teenage son, but who will fly into a rage if he
finds a single joint of grass in that same son's room, is reacting
to a fear that runs far deeper than concern for anyone's well-being
other than his own. Instinctively, many in our society have sensed
what is going on: namely, that the premises and assumptions upon
which this social order was built are being shaken at their roots,
and that drugs, in some mysterious way, are a critical factor.
The people who advocate their use, or who, more simply, <I>use</I>
them, <I>are</I> in some fundamental way <I>different.</I> They
come, rather literally, from another world. They are foreigners,
aliens, members of another tribe. The reaction to them is almost
as ferocious as the reaction to immigrants in earlier times.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was presumably an understanding of this which prompted Eldridge
Cleaver to write that the conflict between the generations today
is deeper, even, than the struggle between the races. Although
it is much more than a purely generational conflict, there are
proportionately far fewer older people who perceive the &quot;greater
reality&quot; than there are young ones.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This great reality is, to begin with, ecological. Ecology, after
all, is merely one of the first of our Western sciences to escape
the clutch of Aristotelian logic. Of necessity, it abandons subject-predicate
methods in favor of relational methods, extends the concept of
the organism-as-a-whole to &quot;organism-as-a-whole-in environments,&quot;
is non-anthropomorphic, and concerns itself with whole systems
in a functional (rather than merely additive) nonlinear manner.
The orders and relations recognized by ecology are &quot;higher;&quot;
that is, they are more profound. Peter Henry Liederman notes that
we are moving from the Dialectic Age to the Ecological or Global
Age. The &quot;greater reality&quot; is becoming increasingly
apparent. &quot;Western philosophy has taught us to think of everything
in terms of dualisms, diametrically opposed, competing opposites.
However, the philosophical base of Western thinking may be undergoing
drastic change, for in science, politics, economics, and even
religion, it is becoming less and less popular to view everything
in isolation from the total system surrounding it.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But ecology recognizes, as yet, only purely physical relationships
and harmonies. The task of exploring further non-physical relationships
has fallen to such embryonic sciences as parapsychology. J. B.
Rhine has been able to verify experimentally the reality of psychokinesis,
extra-sensory perception, precognition, clairvoyance, and telepathy.
Evidence is beginning to accumulate that plants have emotions,
that there is a &quot;pool&quot; of vegetable consciousness which
functions telepathically across great distances and possesses
memory. Experiments by Clive Backster indicate that every living
cell has &quot;primary perception,&quot; which implies a mind
of sorts. (A test tube sample of human sperm was able to select
its &quot;daddy&quot; from a group of men.) Amoebas, mold cultures,
fresh fruits and vegetables, yeasts and blood samples have all
shown &quot;emotional&quot; reactions recorded on the galvanic
skin-response section of polygraph instruments, and the &quot;power
of prayer&quot; to affect the growth of plants has been repeatedly
demonstrated. The literature which almost overnight has become
available on these new &quot;paranormal&quot; frontiers of the
mind is staggering. While it is true that much of it can be dismissed
as being exploitive and sensationalistic, it remains that empirical
data is accumulating at a tremendous rate. Much of the serious
work being done is going on in the Soviet Union, although Soviet
scientists take the position that psi results (which many of them
acknowledge) must stem from some unknown physical source of energy.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
J.B. Rhine, after forty years of experimental work in the field
of parapsychology, was able to put it sweetly: &quot;If a man
criticizes us honestly, I know that he just has his windows cut
to a certain size and can't see any further.&quot; <I>And can't
see any further</I>. Here perhaps, is the edge which splits our
society so cleanly into fundamentally different camps. On the
one hand: the predominantly older individuals whose perception
is filtered through a pre-existing operational structure, the
result of previous experience, conditioning and internalization
of culturally-patterned points of view. And on the other: the
mainly younger individuals whose reticular system has been softened
in a variety of ways (electronic media would be one) so that it
is not so tightly bounded and fixed, in terms of what they are
able to perceive; and for these individuals the traditional Western
mode of consciousness is but one wavelength on the spectrum of
perception. Other wavelengths are more apparent to them.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The consciousness which emerges once the walls fashioned by Western
science and religion have been dissolved or penetrated by drugs
is not by any means a peculiar consciousness. The extent to which
it is in harmony with the teachings and intuitive knowledge of
other times and places (pre-technological and non-Aristotelian)
has been clearly revealed by various studies, perhaps the most
definitive one of which was reported by Willis Harman in <I>Main
Currents of Modern Thought</I> :
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Through the psychedelic experience persons tend to accept beliefs
which are at variance with the usual conception of the &quot;scientific
world view.&quot; In a current study (by C. Savage, W. Harman,
J. Fadiman, and E. Savage) the subjects were given prior to and
immediately after the LSD session, a collection of 100 belief
and value statements to rank according to the extent they felt
the statements expressed their views. Subsequent personality and
behavior-pattern changes were evaluated by standard clinical instruments
and independent interviews. It was found that therapeutic consequences
of the LSD session were predictable on the basis of the extent
to which subjects indicated increased belief in statements such
as the following:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;I believe that I exist not only in the familiar world of
space and time, but also in a realm having a timeless, eternal
quality.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Behind the apparent multiplicity of things in the world
of science and common sense there is a single reality in which
all things are united.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;It is quite possible for people to communicate telepathically,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
without any use of sight or hearing, since deep down our minds
are all connected.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Of course the real self exists on after the death of the
body.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;When one turns his attention inward, he discovers a world
of 'inner space' which is as vast and as real as the external,
physical world.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Man is, in essence, eternal and infinite.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Somehow, I feel I have always existed and always will.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Although this may sound absurd, I have the feeling that
somehow I have participated in the creation of everything around
me.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;I feel that the mountains and the sea and the stars are
all part of me, and my soul is in touch with the souls of all
creatures.&quot; &quot;Each of us potentially has access to vast
realms of knowledge through his own mind, including secrets of
the universe known so far only to a very few.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that in accepting these statements the individual is in effect
saying that he is convinced of the possibility of gaining valid
knowledge through an extrasensory mode of perception.

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Dr. John Beresford, who has described the discovery of LSD as
possibly the most critical event in human history, remarked: &quot;Take
it once and you know that all you've known about consciousness
is wrong.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The point here is simply to emphasize that the consciousness which
comes into focus through the medium of drugs is basically no different
from the consciousness manifest in various ways in most, if not
all, peoples who have not been snagged by the inherent limitations
of Western thought-processes. Those belief and value statements
just quoted might have been uttered as readily by ancient Chinese,
aboriginal Bantu tribesmen, Eskimos, American Indians, devotees
of the Upanishads, Buddhists, Taoists and Zen masters, as they
were by Westerners who had taken LSD. And those beliefs and values,
while sounding strange coming from the heart of Technology Land,
were by no means strange to these other peoples. What was strange,
even frightening and insane, to <I>them</I> was the Western brand
of logic, which was clearly exploitive, atavistic, and egocentric.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
&quot;It is my personal belief, after thirty-five years experience
of it,&quot; wrote Sioux Indian doctor Charles Eastman, &quot;that
there is no such thing as 'Christian civilization.' I believe
that Christianity and modern civilization are opposed and irreconcilable,
and that the spirit of Christianity and of our ancient religion
is essentially the same.&quot; Dr. Eastman here put his finger
on the crack which has now widened to the point where it is breaking
the established Western churches apart. This Sioux would seem
to be closer in spirit to a modern white pothead or acidhead (and
a lot of others, all of whom could be loosely grouped together
under the heading counter culture) than these whites are to their
own elected representatives, the administrators of their universities
and, certainly in many cases, to their own parents.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Ted Hughes has noted that the fundamental guiding ideas of our
Western civilization derive from Reformed Christianity and from
Old Testament Puritanism, which are based
<BLOCKQUOTE>
on the assumption that the earth is a heap of raw materials given
to man by God for his exclusive profit and use. The creepy crawlies
which infest it are devils of dirt and without a soul, also put
there for his exclusive profit and use. By the skin of her teeth,
woman escaped the same role. The subtly apotheosized misogyny
of Reformed Christianity is proportionate to the fanatic rejection
of Nature, and the result has been to exile man from Mother Nature&#151;from
both inner and outer nature. The story of the mind exiled from
Nature is the story of Western Man. It is the story of his progressively
more desperate search for mechanical and rational and symbolic
securities, which will substitute for the spirit-confidence of
the Nature he has lost. The basic myth for the ideal Westerner's
life is the Quest. The quest for a marriage in the soul or a physical
re-conquest. The lost life must be captured somehow. It is the
story of spiritual romanticism and heroic technological progress.
It is a story of decline. When something abandons Nature, or is
abandoned by Nature, it has lost touch with its creator, and is
called an evolutionary dead end. According to this, our Civilization
is an evolutionary error. Sure enough, when the modern mediumistic
artist looks into his crystal, he sees always the same thing.
He sees the last nightmare of mental disintegration and spiritual
emptiness, under the super-ego of Moses, in its original or in
some Totalitarian form, and the self-anaesthetising schizophrenia
of St. Paul. This is the soul-state of our civilisation. But he
may see something else. He may see a vision of the real Eden,
'excellent as at the first day,' the draughty radiant Paradise
of the animals, which is the actual earth, is the actual Universe:
he may see Pan, whom Nietzsche, first in the depths, mistook for
Dionysus, the vital, somewhat terrible spirit of natural life,
which is new in every second. Even when it is poisoned to the
point of death, its efforts to be itself are new in every second.
This is what will survive, if anything can. And this is the soul-state
of the new world. But while the mice in the field are listening
to the Universe, and moving in the body of nature, where every
living cell is sacred to every other, and all are interdependent,
the housing speculator is peering at the field through a visor,
and behind him stands the whole army of madmen's ideas.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
So the &quot;greater reality&quot; is an ecological consciousness,
coupled with an intuitive awareness of the existence of super-sensory
phenomena; it is, further a pantheistic consciousness well-understood
by non-technological peoples, not bounded by an Euclidean, Aristotelian
or Newtonian conceptual framework, a &quot;native&quot; (i.e.,
non-literate, less rigidly structured) sensibility. And it involves,
as well, a kind of existentialism: that is, the awareness that
man is a creature with no excuses. Meaning is something we invent
or create for ourselves; everything we do, whether we are willing
to acknowledge it or not, we <I>choose</I> to do. Authoritarian
religions flourish in direct proportion to the unwillingness of
great numbers of people to assume responsibility for what they
are and what they do. Reliance on a higher moral authority&#151;an
anthropomorphic authority, at any rate&#151;is no different from
reliance on a parent for guidance. It is evidence, simply. that
one has not grown up or learned to stand on one's own feet; it
is, in an adult, a form of regressive behavior. The great sense
of reality involves an awareness of more complex orders, higher
levels of interaction and influence, but it does not allow that
these be grasped solely through metaphor or allegory: it demands
that they be perceived directly. The responsibility for bringing
one's behavior into harmony with these more pervasive orders of
existence remains with the individual.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Through the medium of drugs, many people achieve a comprehension
of this reality. Others are &quot;there&quot; to begin with, and
many others find their way to it through other media, such as
creative activity, various kinds of existential group therapy,
Gestalt therapy, General Semantics, yoga, meditation, etc. These
other routes are most arduous, yet when they do finally break
the mind out of its cage, the effects are more lasting and indelible.
By <I>themselves,</I> drugs can awaken individuals to a higher
consciousness, but they cannot keep anyone there. If we may conceive
of &quot;normal&quot; consciousness as being a kind of stupor,
then the individual whose only means of awakening involves recourse
to drugs is in the position of a person who must have cold water
dashed in his face repeatedly to keep him on his feet. There is
more than a bit of Pavlov's dog in all of us. Inevitably, through
habitual activity of any kind, whether dependence on drugs or
an alarm clock or cold water or hot coffee, we get programmed,
and to the extent that we are programmed we are that much less
free and that much less capable of creative behavior; we are also
that much less able to respond in new ways to new situations.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The drug experience cannot be understood in the absence of an
understanding of the events and experiences onto which it impresses
itself. For people who are genuinely turned on, drugs are incidental.
Being turned-on is a state of being which exists to varying degrees,
or at least in its embryonic form, <I>before</I> one comes into
contact with drugs; one's consciousness may be liberated by drugs
only to the extent that it was ripe for liberation to begin with.
The answer is not to be found in drugs; drugs may make the questions
clearer, or even pose them. But what answers there are can be
found only in existence, in the experience of one's being. Turned-off
people generally remain turned off, no matter how many drugs they
ingest.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Psychedelics are devices which can be made use of by individuals
whose psychology is properly geared to the era we are entering,
just as automobiles are devices used (sometimes well, sometimes
badly) by people geared to the age we are just leaving. The risk
factor is probably about the same. And let us not forget the reactions
of horror and loathing with which the automobile was greeted when
it made its debut. Simply, if we do not consider it immoral to
drive to the supermarket in the jockstrap of a mechanical monster,
why should we consider it immoral to be carried somewhere else
in the arms of a psychopharmacological angel? Drugs lend themselves
to the kind of psychic adjustments which are involved in being
turned on, just as cars lend themselves to the state of mind which
derives some value from mobility.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
We may understand the drug phenomenon better if we think in terms
of the need for equilibrium. It was not until the advent of mass
media that the operational mode of consciousness could penetrate
every level of experience. At every point of contact with the
world <I>out there</I> we found ourselves confronted with engineers.
Our emotional responses had been fiddled with, tickled, trained.
Every commercial sought to control these responses. Every government
announcement had been designed to impress itself upon us at the
deepest level possible. Subtle (and often not-so-subtle) manipulation
had become the overwhelmingly dominant characteristic of the mass
society in whose currents we found ourselves washed. Manipulation
is pure operationalism. Almost nothing was said or done &quot;in
public&quot; without a reason. The whole public sector had been
turned into a fantasy world. Not incidentally, but fundamentally.
And not despite &quot;rationality,&quot; but strictly in accordance
with the functionalistic imperatives inherent in our concept of
rationality. It was to this world that we related ourselves, incorporating
its distortions into our own systems. Even our &quot;spontaneity,&quot;
in part, had become based on emotional responses patterned on
false memories.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Yet in its natural state, human consciousness possesses a &quot;center,&quot;
which is not a single point of identity but a psychic ecosystem
of sorts. It was this system whose equilibrium had been massively
disrupted by the full-scale intrusions of technological rationality,
and it was this system which needed to right itself in order for
identity, the touchstone of consciousness, to retain some basic
intactness. Just as physically we require nourishment (real food)
in order to survive, so psychically, we require real, substantial
experience, real events, real people. Certainly, we still have
much of that. But the servings of real experience, in relative
terms, had shrunk drastically in comparison to the unreal experience
with which we were daily confronted. The psyche was to become
undernourished, its internal equilibrium was disrupted, and in
order to regain that equilibrium, to replenish itself, the, psyche
had to make some large re-adjustments. It had to become more adept
at distinguishing real from unreal, in order to reject the toxic
food of unreal experience. And it had to find ways of improving
its immediate perception of things and events. Drugs, insofar
as their <I>use</I> (as opposed to their <I>misuse</I>) assisted
in the process of cleansing the doors of perception, enlarging
them at any rate so that they were no longer contained within
the artificial operational frame, were admirably suited to one
of the essential psychic requirements of the times.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Let us back up a bit at this point and see if we can get a little
closer to what is meant by a &quot;psychic center.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To begin with, not very much is known about the &quot;mind&quot;
except that it is assumed to exist somewhere inside the brain.
That does not narrow the search very much: exploring the brain
is like sending a rocket into space; it is a bottomless universe.
One might ask, where in the midst of the uncharted region am &quot;I&quot;?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There are roughly twelve billion nerve cells inside the brain.
Each is capable of transmitting and receiving impulses from other
nerve cells. Some of these cells may have as many as ten thousand
transmitting terminals each. In comparison to the complexity of
the workings of these cells, the most sophisticated computer is
nothing much more than a toy.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Roughly, the brain is made up of the left and right cerebral hemispheres,
each covered by a deeply folded cortex. Each cortex has a temporal
lobe having something to do with hearing, an occipital lobe relating
to seeing, a parietal region having to do with skin sensations
and muscular activity, and the crucial frontal lobe which gives
us the power to plan. Among other things, the brain also contains
large tracts known only as &quot;Silent Areas&quot; about which
nobody knows very much. Our sense of consciousness is assumed
to be housed in the cortex, popularly known as the seat of the
intellect. But when Wilder Penfield of the Montreal Neurological
Institute explored the cortex of his patients during brain surgery
by &quot;tickling&quot; different parts of it with an electrode,
he discovered that the person being tickled could not be &quot;found&quot;
there. &quot;I&quot; was always somewhere else. As science writer
N. J. Berrill puts it, people make use of the cortex, and may
even in part be embodied there, but they remain &quot;elusive
even though fully at home....&quot; The question of consciousness
is two-fold: What is it and where is it? We know almost nothing
of the nature of thought and little of the relationship of mind
to brain. &quot;One of the few things which is known is that the
activity of the brain is almost pure energy, primarily electrical.
All cell activity is accompanied by electrical charges.&quot;
Marshall McLuhan has defined automation as being &quot;a non-specialist
kind of energy or power that can be used in a great variety of
ways.&quot; This definition could as easily be applied to the
mind, which could also be referred to as a &quot;total synchronized
electric field.&quot; Or, as Jung has described it, &quot;a question
mark arbitrarily confined within the skull.&quot; Science writer
Berrill sums up most of what is known about the mind by saying,
rather lamely, &quot;consciousness, thought, the mind itself,
are the expressions or creations of the sum total of the activities
of twelve billion cells, each with multiple extensions and connections.
Together they seem to embody pure energy of an electrical nature.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Our thoughts, our sense of identity itself, somehow emerge out
of the seemingly random interplay of forces within this given
area. How? No one knows. Why? Again, no one knows. Nevertheless,
we take this most central of mysteries for granted. It seldom,
if ever, crosses our &quot;minds&quot; that we do not know what
our &quot;minds&quot; are. &quot;I&quot; exist and am conscious
of being conscious, and it is possible to assume functions, to
take on responsibilities, on the basis of this thinnest of threads
of information.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Our &quot;center&quot; is therefore not a given point, but a whole
effect. The impact of mass media and technological rationality
can now perhaps be better understood. Just as the whole eco-system
of the earth can be disrupted by the addition of certain compounds,
so that the system loses its equilibrium and begins to collapse,
so too can the &quot;mind&quot; be affected. The acquisition of
false memories, false sets of responses, etc., disrupted the internal
harmonies of the psyche in just such a fashion. The mind of technological
man had become polluted. Well, everyone knew this. But few realized
just how far the pollution had gone and how dangerous it was.
The earth, obviously, had suffered the effects of pollution for
thousands of years without its atmospheric balance being decisively
affected. It was not until the Industrial Revolution that man's
capacity to pollute took a quantum leap, suddenly threatening
the balance of the whole global eco-system. Individual psychic
ecosystems had, too, been affected by manipulation and tampering
for thousands of years, but it was not until arrival of mass society
that these basic harmonies likewise found themselves threatened
on a gigantic scale. Drugs, at this point, may fairly accurately
be conceived of as detergents being added to oil slick in order
to clean up the mess.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The central point about drugs is the most obvious: the fact that
they do nothing except alter the chemical relationships in the
brain. (The mescaline molecule, for instance, resembles adrenaline.
When mescaline is introduced, this enzyme, mistaking the mescaline
molecules for adrenaline, begins to destroy them. While its attention
is focused on the mescaline, however, the adrenaline begins to
accumulate elsewhere: the enzyme can't handle both.) Once the
chemical environment has been altered, the brain begins to function
differently. <I>It is still functioning</I>. But not in accordance
with established frames of reference. Frequently, it begins to
work overtime. Images, thoughts, impressions, always flashing
about in the background, suddenly move to stage center. The brain
is now functioning in a different continuum. Like an engine run
at high speed, it gets &quot;broken in,&quot; accustomed, that
is, to operating at a different frequency, rate of speed, and
along different perceptual avenues. It becomes, in many basic
respects, more agile.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It is, as a result, more <I>prepared</I> to move in new evolutionary
directions. The mind trains with drugs. It acquires new reflexes,
a new kind of coordination. It exercises its muscles and gets
itself ready to take the leap into the future. The drug phenomenon
is not an end. It is the beginning of something which has never
happened before. What will follow is now becoming apparent. Drugs,
finally, are only another medium. In the context of technological
society, acting synergistically in relation to rock music, mass
media, urbanization, and a host of other factors, this major new
medium carries the message of change, <I>real</I> change, as opposed
to a mere change in flags, label, underwear, or oaths of loyalty.

<h4>THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SUBCULTURE IN DEVELOPING RITUALS<br>
AND SOCIAL SANCTIONS FOR CONTROLLED DRUG USE </h4>

<hr>
<i>

<p>Introduction by Peter Webster</i></center></p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The following paper, from 1977, is an example
of the high quality research into the use of psychedelics and
other &quot;drugs of abuse&quot; that continued despite
governmental restrictions and other discouragements to workers in
the field of drug research. As with so many research projects,
the findings were not at all what prohibitionist functionaries
wanted or could accept, and such reports were often vehemently
rejected by their sponsors, and ignored by the media who would
have trumpeted the results on high had they supported
Prohibition. The study here is of particular interest in that it
indicates that drug users in today's societies tend to re-create
in a modern context the methods and rituals of drug use seen in
tribal societies which enable the drugs to be used safely and for
certain defined purposes. The authors conclude: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Our findings show that, contrary to conventional
    wisdom, controlled use of illicit drugs is possible and is
    fostered by subcultural rituals and social sanctions that
    support controlled use and curtail drug abuse... Ironically,
    the present attempt to eliminate all use of illicit drugs
    undermines users' ability to control them... What is clear is
    that the attempt to eliminate all use of these drugs
    contributes to their abuse by people who take them. </p>
    <p> &quot;Certainly decriminalization of marihuana should be
    extended beyond those few states which have adopted it, and
    federal penalties for use should be dropped. Further research
    on the possible medical applications of marihuana and the
    psychedelics should be undertaken, and results sufficiently
    publicized so that their public image as &quot;bad&quot;
    drugs can be dissipated. Heroin should be made available to
    physicians as a legitimate analgesic, and experimentation
    with heroin maintenance clinics for the treatment of addicts
    should also begin with careful control. </p>
    <p> &quot;Drug education programs which are no more than
    disguised campaigns to eliminate use should be replaced with
    genuine efforts to provide users and non-users with some
    rudimentary pharmacological data and with detailed
    information about the consequences of various patterns of
    use. Doctors, teachers, counselors, and others who encounter
    drug users should be instructed in how to distinguish use
    from abuse&#151;it simply makes no sense to alienate and
    undermine those segments of the population of drug-takers who
    stand against abuse. </p>

IN DEVELOPING RITUALS AND SOCIAL SANCTIONS<br>
FOR CONTROLLED DRUG USE <a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> </h2>

<h4>WAYNE M. HARDING &amp; NORMAN E. ZINBERG, M.D.*</h4>

<hr>

<p> In the United States, social and legal taboos against the
nonmedical use of illicit drugs are reinforced by the prevailing
view that these drugs are almost animately pernicious. According
to this view, marihuana, LSD, cocaine, heroin, and other illicit
drugs are so overpowering and/ or so dangerous that their
continued use inevitably leads to drug abuse. The physiological
and psychological damage evidenced by the most serious abusers of
illicit drugs is regularly invoked as proof of this
&quot;pharmacomythology&quot; (Szasz, 1975) . </p>

<p> There is nothing in the pharmacology of these drugs, however,
that precludes the possibility that they can be used without
being abused. Our study of controlled drug use, sponsored by The
Drug Abuse Council, Inc., has located users of marihuana,
psychedelics, and opiates who, like most alcohol users, manage to
maintain regular non-compulsive use of these drugs, Analysis of
longitudinal interview data indicates that this 'controlled' use
is chiefly supported by emerging subcultural drug-using rituals
and social sanctions. These rituals and social sanctions provide
what the larger culture does not: instruction in and
reinforcement for maintaining patterns of illicit drug use which
do not interfere with ordinary functioning and methods for use
which minimize untoward drug effects. </p>

<p> In this article we discuss these findings and the related
work of other researchers. We also argue that existing
subcultural rituals and social sanctions, elaborated and endorsed
by the mainstream culture, could be a more humane and perhaps
more effective means of preventing drug abuse than legal
prohibition. </p>

<p> Serious consideration of such alternatives is especially
timely given the recent actions of some states to significantly
reduce the legal penalties surrounding the use of marihuana. It
appears that these reductions have been prompted by a growing
realization that our costly social policy has not succeeded in
halting marihuana use by a large number of Americans. Thus far,
however public debate over liberalization of drug laws has not
taken into account changes in drug-using style. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <center></p>

<h3>DEFINITION OF TERMS</h3>
</center>

<p> As used here. 'ritual' refers to the stylized, prescribed
behavior surrounding the use of a drug. This behavior may include
methods of procuring and administering the drug, selection of
physical and social settings for use, activities undertaken after
the drug has been administered, and methods of preventing
untoward drug effects. </p>

<p> 'Social sanctions' refers to the norms regarding how or
whether a particular drug should be used. Social sanctions
include both the informal and often unspoken values or rules of
conduct shared by a group, and the formal laws and policies
regulating drug use.<a name="back2"></a><a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>
These two aspects of social sanctions are not always consonant.
Laws prohibiting use of illicit drugs may reflect the values of
the majority of Americans but are often at odds with the values
of drug users. Various segments of society thus observe quite
different social sanctions (and rituals) although each segment is
cognizant of and influenced by the other's. The relationship
among the rituals and social sanctions of controlled illicit drug
users, of compulsive users, and of the mainstream culture is a
focus of concern in later portions of this paper. </p>

<p> Our use of the terms 'ritual' and 'social sanction' differs
from the classic use of the terms 'ritual' and 'ritual belief' in
anthropology. The distinction between drug-using rituals and
social sanctions is one of behavior versus beliefs, or practice
versus dogma. In anthropology, terms such as 'ritual beliefs' and
'ceremonial beliefs' are used instead of 'social sanctions' (
Leach, 1968) . We prefer 'social sanctions' for two reasons.
First, this term emphasizes that beliefs are socially derived and
reinforced. Second, 'social sanctions' conveys more clearly than
'ritual beliefs' the sense that behavior and belief are separable
concepts. While it is true that rituals and ritual beliefs are
intimately related, and sometimes virtually indistinguishable, we
have found that different drug users ( heroin addicts versus
controlled heroin users, for example) may share very similar
drug-using rituals, yet subscribe to dichotomous social
sanctions. In other words, social sanctions can be used to
predict the type of drug use when rituals cannot. </p>

<p> The terms 'rituals' and 'ritual beliefs' have been applied
most frequently to magical or religious phenomena. Goody and
others have included secular events (e.g., civil marriage
ceremony) under the rubric of ritual, but reserve the term to
describe behavior in which &quot;the relationship between means
and ends is not intrinsic is either rational or
non-rational&quot; ( Goody, 1961) . What is usually excluded is
any behavior which &quot;is technical or recreational&quot; (
Gluckman, 1962) . </p>

<p> Our use of ritual and social sanction violates this tradition
in two distinct ways. First, we are applying these terms to drug
use whether the goal of the user is recreation, improved mental
or physical performance, or religious experience.<a name="back3"></a><a
href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a> Second, drug-using rituals and
social sanctions include both rational and nonrational elements.
The intravenous injection of heroin is causally related to the
subsequent <i>high</i> while <i>booting</i> (drawing of blood
back into the syringe and re-injecting one or more times ) is
not, although users may believe that it is. </p>

<p> Our departure from the more restricted meaning of ritual is
not without precedent among anthropologists. Klauser (1964), for
example, discussed the cocktail party as a ritual. It is worth
explaining, however, why the concept 'ritual', even in modified
form, is so aptly applied to drug use. </p>

<p> Within very broad limits, the objective and subjective
effects of a psychoactive drug depend as much on how the drug is
used and the expectations of the user as on its chemical
properties. Booting does increase some heroin users' sense of
euphoria. A placebo can alleviate pain as effectively as morphine
provided the user believes he is receiving an analgesic. Tobacco
acts as a powerful hallucinogen in some Amazonian tribes where it
is used infrequently in high doses (Weil, 1972). These are but a
few examples of the mutability of drug effect which can be
attributed to the discrete influence of rituals and social
sanctions, whether rational or nonrational, on the drug user.
Szasz (1975) similarly justifies applying the term to drug use
because it reveals the enormous range in the consequences of that
use which are otherwise hidden by a strictly pharmacological
perspective: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Perhaps because of all the major modern nations, the
    United States is the least tradition bound, Americans are
    most prone to misapprehend and misinterpret ritual as
    something else: the result is that we mistake magic for
    medicine, and confuse ceremonial effect with chemical cause.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> Finally, in this paper we are mainly interested in drug-using
rituals and social sanctions of a specific kind: those which
foster controlled drug use. Drinking muscatel from a bag-wrapped
bottle while squatting in a doorway, or soliciting psychedelics
from strangers on a street corner is not a controlling ritual.
The positive social status attached to the ability to withstand
extraordinarily high doses of LSD, the risk involved in <i>getting
loaded</i> on barbiturates and alcohol, or the size of one's
heroin habit does not constitute a controlling social sanction.
In the following section we outline the nature of social
sanctions and rituals which do promote control, using alcohol as
an example. This discussion will provide a basis from which to
examine the existing subcultural social sanctions and rituals
which facilitate the controlled use of illicit drugs and inhibit
their abuse. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <center></p>

<h3>RITUALS, SOCIAL SANCTIONS,<br>
AND CONTROLLED ALCOHOL USE</h3>
</center>

<p> Although alcohol is a powerful and addictive psychoactive
drug which can produce profound physiological and psychological
damage, the vast majority of Americans who drink alcohol manage
to control it. There are an estimated 105 million drinkers in the
United States compared to some 8 million alcoholics (New York
Times, April 9, 1973). Widespread controlled alcohol use can be
understood in terms of culturally based rituals and social
sanctions which pattern the way the drug is used . </p>

<p> Alcohol-using rituals define appropriate use by limiting
consumption to specific occasions or circumstances. Having a
highball before dinner, wine with a meal, a few drinks at a
cocktail party, a beer with the boys after work, or a drink at a
business luncheon are examples. Positive social sanctions permit
and even encourage moderate use of the drug: one need only
consider the occasions when a drink is offered to appreciate how
well alcohol is integrated into the culture as an approved social
intoxicant. This social acceptance of alcohol is paralleled by
the minimal legal restrictions on its consumption, and by the
negative sanctions which condemn promiscuous use and drunkenness.
&quot;Know your limit,&quot; &quot;Don't drink and drive,&quot;
&quot;Don't mix drinks,&quot; and &quot;Never drink before
noon&quot; are familiar proscriptions. </p>

<p> The internalization of these social sanctions and rituals
begins in early childhood. The child sees his parents and other
adults drinking. He learns the possibilities of excess and the
varieties of acceptable drinking patterns from newspapers,
movies, magazines, and television. As he matures, he develops a
more unconscious than conscious sense that alcohol use can be
pleasant, controlled, and socially approved. In some cases, this
socialization process is more direct&#151;children sip wine at
religious rituals and celebrations, or taste their parents'
drinks. Many authorities believe that a gradual and careful early
introduction to alcohol by parents contributes to restrained
adult use.<a name="back4"></a><a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a> </p>

<p> Many adolescents drink without parental permission, and some
test the wisdom of the social sanctions and rituals with which
they are already familiar by getting drunk and nauseated.
However, the central issue of this testing is not so much how to
drink as it is how long the adolescent must defer approved social
drinking. Neither the adolescent nor his parents have much fear
that occasional undercover experimentation will seriously or
permanently disrupt social relationships and performance at
school or work. Throughout this period of early use, the
adolescent has numerous adult role models for controlled use and
he can easily find friends who share his interest in drinking as
well as his resolve to avoid compulsive use. </p>

<p> At some point the young user receives direct or tacit
approval for drinking from parents and other significant adults,
marking the end of family-centered socialization in the use of
alcohol.<a name="back5"></a><a href="#note5"><sup>5</sup></a> As
the user begins to drink in public, he melds the general
culture's rituals and social sanctions and his previous learning
into an individualized but socially acceptable pattern of alcohol
use. Social reinforcement for controlled use continues throughout
adult life. </p>

<p> Obviously the influence of rituals and social sanctions on
the alcohol user is partial and imperfect. Other
variables&#151;social forces, personality factors, and perhaps
genetic differences&#151;also influence how groups and
individuals use the drug. The social sanctions and rituals
associated with controlled use are not uniformly distributed in
the culture. Some ethnic groups (e.g., the Irish) tend to lack
strong sanctions against drunkenness and have a correspondingly
high incidence of alcoholism (Wilkinson, 1970) . Furthermore,
even when functioning rituals and social sanctions are available,
family-centered socialization may break down. Nonetheless,
prevailing rituals and social sanctions exert a discernible, and
crucial, moderating influence over the way most Americans use
alcohol. </p>

<p> The importance of such rituals and social sanctions has been
dramatized by the disastrous effects of the introduction of
alcohol to societies which lacked them. American Indian tribes
demonstrate long-standing, controlled, highly ritualized use of
naturally occurring psychoactive plants such as jimson weed and
peyote (LaBarre, 1938). The Indians' legendary susceptibility to
alcoholism stems essentially from a lack of similar cultural
conventions for the use of the <i>white man's</i> drug. Because
the Indian has rejected and has been denied full membership in
American society, his inculturation in alcohol-using rituals and
social sanctions has been retarded. Consequently, alcoholism
persists among Indians and the &quot;consequences of alcohol use
are frequently deep inebriation, rather than courtly
pleasantries&quot; (Freedman, 1974). Wilkinson (1970) reports
that when the Eskimos of Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island, were first
granted legal permission to drink, their lack of previous
cultural experience and guidelines for alcohol use resulted in
pronounced abuse . </p>

<p> A similar problem exists for Americans who use illicit drugs.
It is not at all surprising that so many of these people wind up
as compulsive users. There are virtually no socially accepted
models for the controlled use of these drugs, no positive
cross-generational education in how to use them, and no
reinforcement or assistance in moderate use (Abrams, 1972)<a
name="back6"></a><a href="#note6"><sup>6</sup></a> The mainstream
culture not only fails to assist controlled, illicit drug use, it
actively discriminates against it. Any and all use of illicit
drugs is prohibited. Persons who use these drugs are regarded as
deviant: either as <i>sick</i> and in need of counseling and
rehabilitation, or as criminal and deserving of punishment. It is
clear that use and abuse of illicit drugs must be understood from
a socio-cultural as well as a pharmacological perspective. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <center></p>

<h3>REVIEW OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH</h3>
</center>

<p> By and large, the research literature reflects the reigning
cultural outlook on illicit drug use in that it fails to
differentiate between use and abuse. One reviewer of 35 recent
studies states that their most serious flaw is that &quot;they
have lumped together all drug users without considering the
extent of their use&quot; ( Heller, 1972) . </p>

<p> Patterns of drug abuse such as heroin addiction have been
singled out for intensive study, but there has been little effort
to delineate patterns of use lying between the extremes of
abstinence and abuse or compulsive use. The lack of a definite
typology for drug-using behavior bespeaks the continuing and
pervasive tendency to confound quite different patterns of drug
consumption. </p>

<p> The terms in the literature which are closest to controlled
use are 'chipping', 'occasional use', 'experimenting', and
'tasting'. 'Chipping' and 'occasional use' are usually associated
with heroin and the opiates. 'Taster' (Kaplan, 1971) and
'experimenter' (Keniston, 1968-69) have been specifically applied
to marihuana and psychedelic users. All these terms refer to
irregular, nonaddictive, or minimally abusive drug use, but do
not necessarily connote the elements of moderation, regularity,
stability, and non-abuse which we mean by controlled use. </p>

<p> A computer search of the MEDLINE file<a name="back7"></a><a
href="#note7"><sup>7</sup></a> covering a 47-month period
(January 1969 through November 1972) produced no articles
specifically concerning occasional use of any drug. An informal
search for mention of occasional use, however, yielded several
allusions to occasional use. Jordan Scher (1961, 1966) mentions
the existence of controlled heroin use in work done through the
Cook County Narcotic Project. Isador Chein et al. (1964) note the
existence of &quot;long continued, nonaddictive heroin
users.&quot; Howard Becker (1963) discusses occasional marihuana
use as a stage preceding regular use during which &quot;the
individual smokes sporadically and irregularly&quot; because he
has not yet established a reliable source for the drug. W.H.Dobbs
(1971) warns that not all applicants to methadone programs who
are using heroin may be drug dependent. John Newmeyer (1974)
found some heroin users who, he feels, should not be regarded as
representative of a junkie population because they &quot;could
sample heroin without becoming addicted.&quot; </p>

<p> The focus in each of these sources is more on regular than
controlled use, and little importance is attached to different
using patterns. The authors do not seriously consider regular
controlled use as a stable use pattern for a significant number
of people. </p>

<p> To our knowledge only one published study ( Douglas Powell,
1973), also sponsored by The Drug Abuse Council, Inc., focuses
specifically on occasional drug use or occasional users. Powell
interviewed subjects who had been occasional users of heroin for
at least three years without becoming physically addicted. Many
of the using patterns described in Powell's report, however,
appear so unstable or so damaging that they lie outside the
patterns of controlled use we are investigating. Still, Powell's
study supports our efforts in that he established the existence
of occasional ( if not controlled) heroin users and he found that
such users &quot;are responsive to research and can be studied
reliably with relatively simple techniques.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <center></p>

<h3>METHODS OF THE DAC STUDY</h3>
</center>

<p> The major goals of the Drug Abuse Council study are: </p>

<p> 1. to locate controlled users of marihuana, psychedelics, and
opiates; </p>

<p> 2. to describe such users and their various patterns of use;
and </p>

<p> 3. to identify factors which stabilize and destabilize
controlled use. Potential subjects were initially solicited
through universities, advertisements in the underground press,
and a variety of social service agencies including halfway
houses, drug treatment programs, and counseling centers. Once
underway, we found, as Powell did, that after completing the
screening/interview procedure, subjects were often willing to
refer drug-using friends and acquaintances to the project. Six
indigenous data gatherers ( i.e. members of the drug-using
subculture) were recruited to assist in locating and interviewing
subjects.<a name="back8"></a><a href="#note8"><sup>8</sup></a> </p>

<p> The following are the minimum criteria developed for
participation in the project. </p>

<p> 1. Subjects had to have used marihuana, a psychedelic, or an
opiate for at least one year. </p>

<p> 2. Subjects had to be willing to participate in follow-up
interviews. </p>

<p> 3. A subject had to have used the drug frequently enough to
be considered a regular user, but not so frequently that he was
physically addicted to it ( in the case of opiates ) or that his
level of use was likely to interfere with effective personal and
social functioning. No precise cutoff points for frequency of use
were established. In practice, a marihuana user who had used only
a dozen times in the previous year was not selected because his
use seemed too infrequent to be regarded as regular, and a weekly
user of psychedelics was not selected because such frequency
suggested a possibly abusive drug-using pattern. </p>

<p> 4. When subjects were polydrug users, all of the drugs used (
including alcohol) had to be used rather than abused. A subject
who was a moderate bi-weekly heroin user, but who was
physiologically addicted to barbiturates, was not eligible to
participate. </p>

<p> Interviews lasted from one and one half hours to two hours or
more. Subjects were paid approximately $10 per interview. A
flexible interview schedule was adopted to allow the interviewers
to pursue interesting issues as they arose. For each subject data
were gathered on his history of drug use ( including alcohol);
his relations to work and school, as well as to family and mates;
his relations with drug-using and non-drug-using peers; his
physical health and emotional stability; details of drug-using
situations; and basic demographic variables such as age, years of
schooling, and social class. </p>

<p> </p>

<h4>Profile of the sample</h4>

<p> For approximately two years interview data have been gathered
on 105 controlled users.<a name="back9"></a><a href="#note9"><sup>9</sup></a>
The sample consists of 66 white males, 24 white females, 9 black
males, and 6 black females. Subjects range in age from 14 to 70
years with most in the 18- to 25-year-old age bracket.
Eighty-seven interviewees demonstrate controlled use of
marihuana, 42 have used psychedelics in a controlled way, and 46
are controlled opiate users ( categories overlap) . Follow-up
interviews have been conducted and are still in progress. </p>

<p> We found that the 105 controlled users can be distinguished
from compulsive users along several dimensions. Subjects maintain
ties to institutions like work or school, and regular social
relationships with non-drug users as well as users. Drug use is
important to these subjects but is only one of many other
activities, relegated to leisure time. Most subjects are deviant
only by virtue of their drug use. Some have a history of criminal
activity or school disciplinary problems, which does not
generally overlap their controlled use of a drug. No subjects
manifest physiological or psychological impairment as a result of
controlled use . </p>

<p> Our data contradict the notion that the period of controlled
use is a brief transition stage ending in abuse or abstinence.
Subjects with relatively short histories of controlled
use&#151;slightly over one year, for example&#151;are included in
the sample to clarify the manner in which controlled use is first
established. Long-term follow-up will reveal how stable these
subjects' patterns of use are. The majority of subjects, however,
have been controlled users for several years, and some have
maintained controlled use for as long as ten years. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <center></p>

<h3>RITUALS, SOCIAL SANCTIONS, AND CONTROLLED<br>
MARIHUANA, PSYCHEDELIC, AND OPIATE USE</h3>
</center>

<p> Having outlined our methods and profiled the sample, we will
confine ourselves here to a discussion of preliminary findings on
the relation between rituals, social sanctions, and controlled
use.<a name="back10"></a><a href="#note10"><sup>10</sup></a> The
most striking feature of the DAC subjects is that they have
acquired and adhere to rituals and social sanctions which provide
a structure and a mythology for maintaining controlled use and
avoiding untoward drug effects.<a name="back11"></a><a
href="#note11"><sup>11</sup></a> </p>

<p> Acquisition of rituals and social sanctions took place over
the course of subjects' illicit drug-using careers. The details
of this process varied among subjects: some had been controlled
users from the outset of their drug-taking; others had been
through one or more periods of compulsive use before firmly
establishing control. Virtually all subjects, however, required
the assistance of other users to construct appropriate rituals
and social sanctions out of the folklore and practices of the
diverse subculture of drug takers. </p>

<p> It is this association ( often fortuitous ) with one or more
controlled users which provides the necessary reinforcement for
avoiding compulsive use. The using group redefines what is a
highly deviant activity in the eyes of the larger culture, as an
acceptable social behavior within the group. It reifies social
sanctions and rituals and institutionalizes controlled use. This
is consistent with Jock Young's (1971) observations of drug use
in London where he found that some groups &quot;contain lore of
administration, dosage, and use which tend to keep . . . lack of
control in check, plus of course, informal sanctions against the
person who goes beyond these bounds.&quot; </p>

<p> All but two of the DAC subjects have been connected to a
controlled using group. Although subjects sometimes use drugs
alone, upwards of 80 per cent of their use takes place with
others. Use in the company of drug abusers is rare. Controlled
heroin users, for example, tend to limit their contact with
heroin addicts to those occasions when it is necessary to obtain
their drug and to decline invitations to shoot up with their
addict-suppliers. </p>

<p> While association with controlled drug-using groups is the
primary source of controlling rituals and social sanctions for
illicit drug use, it appears that the alcohol education process
may be a secondary source, especially in the case of marihuana
use. Subjects often draw pointed comparisons between social
drinking and their use of illicit drugs. Younger subjects apply
the same language&#151;phrases like <i>getting high</i> and <i>getting
off</i>&#151;to both alcohol and illicit drugs. Subjects describe
social gatherings where both alcohol and marihuana are available
and where an individual's preference for one of these drugs over
the other is interpreted as a matter of personal choice rather
than as a symbolic ideological statement about being in or out of
the drug culture. Some subjects treat alcohol and marihuana in
much the same way. John L., 26, is enrolled full time in a
university and holds down a part-time job. When he returns home
he usually has a drink or a joint before dinner, depending, he
explains, on his mood and his plans for the remainder of the
evening. It seems then that controlled users adapt alcohol-using
rituals and social sanctions to their use of illicit drugs. </p>

<p> Taken as a whole the rituals and social sanctions toward
controlled illicit drug use have several major features: </p>

<p> 1. They define and approve controlled use and condemn
compulsive use . </p>

<p> 2. They limit use to physical and social settings conducive
to a positive drug experience. </p>

<p> 3. They incorporate the principle that use should be kept
infrequent enough to avoid dependence/addiction and to maximize
the desired drug effect . </p>

<p> 4. They identify potential untoward drug effects and
prescribe relevant precautions to be taken before and during use.
</p>

<p> 5. They assist the user in interpreting and controlling his
drug high. </p>

<p> Rituals and social sanctions vary with the pharmacology of
the three drug types we are investigating&#151;marihuana,
psychedelics, and opiates&#151;and with the acceptability of
these drugs within and outside the drug subculture. Therefore,
the following, more detailed discussion of rituals and social
sanctions proceeds by drug type. </p>

<p> </p>

<h4>Marihuana</h4>

<p> Marihuana use is less ritualized than psychedelic and opiate
use. Subjects use the drug in a wide range of settings and
circumstances: before going to a movie, at a party, while
watching television, or during a walk in the woods. Controlled
users do not usually come together specifically to take
marihuana; they meet to socialize and the drug is sometimes taken
as an adjunct to the occasion. Marihuana is also more likely to
be used alone than the psychedelics or opiates. </p>

<p> This flexibility in marihuana rituals is in part due to the
pharmacology of the drug. Marihuana is a relatively mild and
short-acting intoxicant. Our subjects, as experienced users, find
no difficulty in controlling the drug high,<a name="back12"></a><a
href="#note12"><sup>12</sup></a> and they are able to function
normally if that becomes necessary. The high state, therefore, is
compatible with a variety of public and private settings.<a
name="back13"></a><a href="#note13"><sup>13</sup></a> A marihuana
high is also easily arranged, requiring neither the apparatus to
inject an opiate nor the planning to accommodate a 6- to 8-hour
psychedelic high. </p>

<p>Flexibility in marihuana rituals can also be explained in
terms of the drug's status. The expanding number of marihuana
users as well as the growing acceptance of the drug among users
and non-users alike<a name="back14"></a><a href="#note14"><sup>14</sup></a>
has created an environment in which rigid external controls in
the form of rituals are no longer necessary. They have been
supplanted by controlling social sanctions which are less
specific and can be adapted to various using circumstances. DAC
subjects 25 years old and over who began using marihuana in the
early to mid-1960's describe the more marked ritualization of
that period. They recall with nostalgia and humor the dimly lit
room, locked doors, music, candles, incense, people sitting in a
circle on the floor, and one joint passed ceremoniously around
the circle. They now regard this behavior as quaint and
unnecessary. As the number of intermittent marihuana users has
risen to some 8 million Americans and the number who have tried
the drug to 26 million ( Boston Globe, 1974), marihuana use has
lost much of its deviant character. Concurrently, social
sanctions for controlled use have been strengthened and have
become available throughout most of the using subculture. </p>

<p> Under these conditions considerable learning about controlled
use can take place before use actually begins. The choice of
whether or not to use marihuana has become a reality for American
adolescents, and most are well aware before making that choice
that marihuana does not cause people to go crazy or to fall
apart. Younger DAC subjects ( 18 to 20 years) had known of
teachers in their high schools who used marihuana. Many had older
siblings who they knew used the drug. These subjects had also
acquired a sense of what marihuana was like from friends, the
underground press, popular music, novels, and other sources.
Their first few experiences with marihuana were usually
ritualized affairs with one or more newcomers introduced to the
drug by a more experienced user in a secure setting.<a
name="back15"></a><a href="#note15"><sup>15</sup></a> The
experienced users typically provided guidance, demonstrated how
best to smoke the drug, and soothed newcomers' lingering fears.
Very quickly, though, neophyte users moved beyond these
structured situations and began the process of adapting use to a
variety of social settings. Most were able to locate friends with
whom to use the drug and with whom they also shared
non-drug-centered interests. The lack of highly specific rituals
should not, therefore, be construed as evidence that controlled
users are reckless in the way they use marihuana. Rather, the
rituals that earlier served as rigid and external controls have
been replaced over the last decade by more general but equally
effective social sanctions. Due to growing familiarity with every
aspect of marihuana use, these sanctions, like those of alcohol,
are internalized; the rituals developed to support these
sanctions no longer need to be so closely adhered to. Interviews
with subjects reveal how these social sanctions operate to ensure
control. </p>

<p> Subjects describe marihuana as a relatively innocuous drug,
easily controlled, and difficult to abuse.<a name="back16"></a><a
href="#note16"><sup>16</sup></a> Some expressed genuine surprise
when we asked if they had ever had any difficulty in maintaining
controlled use. Subjects are not, however, messianic about
marihuana. They recognize its potential for abuse and offer
guidelines for sensible use: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In spite of all the rationalizations about how good dope
    is, I don't see that I have to have a reason for getting high
    every time but yet getting high consistently without a reason
    for it seems to be a reason to sort of check things out with
    yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> Another subject comments that if marihuana is used too much
the quality of the high declines and when this happens one should
stop for a while and then return to a pattern of more infrequent
use. Subjects generally subscribe to the ethic that they should
not be high at work or at school. Susan S. works as a housekeeper
several days a week. She explains that although she can clean
when she is <i>stoned</i>, she prefers to restrict her drug use
to leisure time. </p>

<p> Controlled users also express the idea that too much
marihuana should not be used at any one time. There are two
reasons cited for this: </p>

<p> 1. to avoid transient but unpleasant panic reactions or
paranoia, and </p>

<p> 2. to keep the high controllable so that other activities can
be better enjoyed . </p>

<p> While passing a joint around a group is no longer <i>de
rigueur</i>, it still serves on many occasions to assist the
process of adjusting the intensity of the high. It allows time to
pass between each inhalation during which the user can monitor
his own degree of intoxication. Several subjects state that when
using alone or with one or two other people, they stop after
several <i>tokes</i> to let the high catch up with them and then
decide whether they want more. One subject comments that this is
an especially sensible way to proceed when trying out a new batch
of marihuana. </p>

<p> </p>

<h4>Psychedelics</h4>

<p> Psychedelics include a wide range of substances that vary
both in potency and duration of effect: LSD, mescaline, peyote,
psilocybin, MDA, DMT, and others. The illicit status of these
drugs creates a major problem for the user; he cannot be certain
what is in the drug he is sold.<a name="back17"></a><a
href="#note17"><sup>17</sup></a> What is presumed to be mescaline
may be LSD. It may be adulterated with PCP, amphetamines, and
other substances&#151;and its dosage can only be guessed at.
Unlike the marihuana high, the psychedelic high<a name="back18"></a><a
href="#note18"><sup>18</sup></a> usually lasts for several hours.
It is an intensive though not uncontrollable experience,
characterized by perceptual changes, sometimes of a hallucinatory
or illusory nature. The risk of a <i>bad trip</i> is always
present and to some degree increased by the lack of quality
control over the drug. For these and other reasons, psychedelics
are regarded as <i>real</i>, i. e., dangerous, drugs within the
drug subculture. They do not have the widespread appeal of
marihuana nor are they treated casually. Most of the rituals and
social sanctions related to the psychedelics deal with making the
drug experience as safe as possible for the user. </p>

<p> For the subjects, psychedelic use is almost invariably a
drug-centered, group activity. Subjects talk about having others
with them who can be relied upon to help cope with a bad trip or
unforeseen events as a requisite for safe tripping: &quot;I have
to do it . . . with someone that I really know well, that I
really trust, and there are some people like that.&quot; People
who are less intimately acquainted are sometimes included in the
group but if so, the trip is commonly preceded by a discussion in
which everyone tries to get comfortable with one another, to
determine who may need extra help or attention, and to establish
ground rules for the trip. During this preliminary discussion, an
experienced user may be assigned to act as a guide for a more
inexperienced or uneasy user. Group members may decide to forbid
wandering off from the group without letting someone know because
it causes people to worry, and worrying is felt to be detrimental
to a positive drug experience. </p>

<p> Subjects agree that planning the trip is an important matter,
even when participants have taken the drug together before and
feel quite close to one another. The need for structure varies,
but pre-trip planning includes issues such as: what foods or
beverages to take along, what activities to engage in during the
trip, whether thorazine or niacin should be available in case of
a bad trip, or whether talking people down is preferable to
medicating them. This planning reaffirms the participants' sense
of shared intentions and strengthens their capability to control
the drug high. </p>

<p> Subjects are adamant about using psychedelics in a proper
setting &#151;<i>a good place.</i> For many this means tripping
in a relatively secluded spot in the country. What seems
important, however, is that the space is secure and comfortable.
A city tripper said, &quot;I'll take a walk outside but it'll
always be with the notion that I can come back to this kind of
sanctuary for myself in the house, and so it's no threat.&quot;
This subject and many others expressed surprise and some disdain
for users who violated the principle that psychedelic use is a
taxing experience that should be confined to special settings: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm amazed that . . . I was living last year with a dude
    who's 17 years old and is from the West Coast. He was telling
    me that when he was going to junior high school he would just
    drop acid in the morning and go to school, which completely
    weirded me out . . . and just could ride with any kind of
    horrible thing . . . Amazing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> Another social sanction/ritual which subjects observe is the
need to be internally prepared for psychedelic use. One subject
describes this as &quot;making peace with the public reality . .
. mentally putting your house, your affairs, in order, you know,
like, what's the Zen thing . . . emptying out the teacup
first.&quot; Others talk simply about needing to be in a
&quot;good mood&quot; and needing &quot;energy&quot; to undertake
the experience. Some subjects appear to ritualize this internal
process by tidying up the space in which they are going to use
the drug. </p>

<p> All the conventions described above represent attempts to
ensure a <i>good</i> trip and prevent a <i>bad</i> one. We now
turn to the issue of how rituals and social sanctions may inhibit
compulsive psychedelic use. </p>

<p> Subjects repeatedly advocate using psychedelics at no less
than two-week intervals. In practice, their use is far less
frequent than this&#151;less than once a month is the most
typical using pattern and, with time, use consistently becomes
even less frequent. Avoidance of compulsive use, however, is
probably not so much the consequence of negative sanctions as it
is the result of a combination of two other factors: </p>

<p> 1. the positive value controlled users attach to the
consciousness-altering properties of psychedelics, and </p>

<p> 2. the fact that tolerance to these consciousness-altering
properties goes up very rapidly as use becomes frequent. Our
subjects who are interested in experiencing precisely these
effects find that too frequent use of the drug is
counterproductive. </p>

<p> Some psychedelic users who are not interested in the
consciousness-changing qualities of these drugs may become
compulsive users. For them, it is the <i>speedy</i>, stimulating
effects of psychedelics that are appealing<a name="back19"></a><a
href="#note19"><sup>19</sup></a> -effects which are enhanced with
larger, more frequent doses of the drug. Although we have little
direct evidence to support it, we would guess that this kind of
compulsive psychedelic user is associated with those groups in
the subculture which negatively value consciousness change or do
not recognize it as a primary drug effect. </p>

<p> By comparing older and younger subjects we have identified
some shifts in psychedelic-using rituals and social sanctions.
Subjects who began use in the mid-sixties share a sense that
psychedelics should be used for &quot;personal growth&quot;
rather than recreational purposes. They discuss tripping as an
activity which is undertaken to accomplish a worthy goal&#151;to
learn more about oneself, to grow intellectually, to transcend
ordinary perceptual boundaries, and so on. However, subjects who
began use in the past five years have broadened their reasons for
using psychedelics to encompass plainly recreational goals. </p>

<p> Younger subjects may trip for a highly rationalized purpose
but they are equally inclined to trip simply to enjoy the high
state. This trend is difficult to interpret and we have yet to
make final judgments. We speculate, however, that the expanded
goals of psychedelic users indicate a growing familiarity with
psychedelics and less guilt about their use. Without wishing to
demean the motives of older users we hypothesize that they needed
to assign some constructive purpose to tripping to justify their
use of drugs which were then seen as more dangerous and powerful
. </p>

<p> We anticipate that as the psychedelic-using population grows,
recreational use will increase and, as with marihuana, will
become less ritualized although not less controlled. We do not
expect, however, that psychedelic-using rituals will ever
approach the degree of flexibility and diversity of
marihuana-using rituals. Quite probably psychedelic use will
become more acceptable and social sanctions more available; but
because of the high impact, long duration drug effect and the
related tendency to keep psychedelic use infrequent there is both
less need and less social opportunity to internalize social
sanctions. Thus, there will remain a dependence on rituals ( on
external controls) which should limit the flexibility and
diversity of psychedelic use. </p>

<p> </p>

<h4>Opiates</h4>

<p> The larger culture condemns the illicit use of opiates more
than any other drug. Popular mythology about the evils of the
opiates and heroin, in particular, extends deep into the drug
subculture itself. Many of the marihuana and psychedelic users in
the DAC study do not recognize the possibility of controlled
opiate use, even though they have identified and dispelled many
of the larger culture's myths about their own drugs of choice.<a
name="back20"></a><a href="#note20"><sup>20</sup></a> </p>

<p> The controlled opiate users<a name="back21"></a><a
href="#note21"><sup>21</sup></a> in our study are painfully aware
that they are seen as deviant. They tend to keep their use a
closely guarded secret from everyone but their one or two dealers
and other controlled opiate users. One of the researchers knew a
woman he considered to be a reasonably close friend for several
years, and although he had been previously involved in
drug-related research, it was not until he became part of the DAC
study that she felt free to &quot;confess&quot; that she had been
a controlled heroin user all the while. , </p>

<p> The relationship of controlled opiate users to
addict/compulsive opiate users is as fraught with dangers and
difficulties as it is necessary. One way controlled users can
assert their normalcy is to spurn and condemn junkies, but they
must rely on junkies to obtain opiates.<a name="back22"></a><a
href="#note22">22</a> Addicts do not understand and are often
threatened by controlled users' peculiar relation to opiates. So,
on the one hand, controlled users get poor quality opiates at
great cost from junkies (&quot;You're always getting
burned&quot;), while on the other hand, they are repeatedly and
seductively invited to become full-fledged members of the junkie
subculture. The controlled user's constant dilemma is to become
friendly enough with an addict to establish a reliable contact
for quality opiates, but not so friendly that his refusals to
fully participate in the addict's subculture insult the dealer
who might then cut off the supply. </p>

<p> Beset on all sides, controlled users are bound together in
small isolated groups that develop idiosyncratic, rigid rituals
and social sanctions. These groups are fragile and drug-centered
because it is difficult to find controlled users who are
compatible as friends&#151;the inverse of the situation with
marihuana we described earlier. </p>

<p> Most of the rituals of controlled opiate users are
indistinguishable from those of compulsive users. In both groups,
people squabble over who gets off first, belts are used as <i>ties</i>,
eye-droppers are used instead of syringes, booting is common, and
<i>works</i> are cleaned but not boiled. The main reason for this
ritual-sharing is that there is no highly visible, communicative
population of controlled users from whom discrete rituals can
evolve. Rituals are still being borrowed from the addict
subculture&#151;the only readily available source of expertise
about the drug. There are also two other explanations for this
phenomenon. First, while the life style of the addict is
repugnant to most controlled users, they sometimes find the
addict's bold outlaw stance attractive; partaking of the addict's
ritual may be an expression of wistful identification. Second,
several subjects were addicts before they became controlled
users, and they have retained their former drug-using rituals
(booting is probably the best example) . </p>

<p> Several controlled users have added new elements to the
addict ritual. One subject, for example, shifts the emphasis away
from getting off by tacking on middle-class amenities&#151;he
plays the good host by serving wine and food to his user guests (
this without any of the nausea which commonly accompanies opiate
use) and all spend the evening together in conversation. Another
user protects herself from a possible overdose by shooting a
little of the drug, waiting to gauge its effect, and then
shooting the remainder. By and large, however. controlled users'
rituals are not well distinguished from those of compulsive
users&#151;especially in details of drug administration. </p>

<p> The social sanctions around controlled use are distinctive.
Controlled users adhere to a variety of rules for opiates, most
of which are summarized by the maxim: &quot;Don't become
dependent.&quot; They well appreciate that they can become
addicted or compulsive users. </p>

<p> Ex-addict subjects have firm rules about frequency of use.
One is a woman who has used heroin on an average of three to four
times a month for over four years. Occasionally, when a break in
her commitments to work and to her child permits, she goes on a
using spree that lasts about a week. Even while on vacation,
however, she will not use heroin more frequently than every other
day. In general, subjects limit their opiate use far more than is
needed to avoid addiction. One subject has confined his heroin
use to weekends only for the past five years. One woman used
heroin twice a month and on special occasions such as birthdays
and New Year's, for a year and a half. Then, troubled by her
tolerance to some of the drug's effects, she deliberately cut
back use to only once a month. She ignored the fact that the
variability in the potency of black market drugs could have
accounted for her requiring the use of two <i>bags</i> instead of
the usual one <i>bag</i> (on only two occasions) to obtain the
same effects as when she used previously. </p>

<p> These and other examples indicate that many controlled users
regard heroin as more rapidly addicting than is warranted, though
they feel that it can be used moderately. This is understandable
in view of the prevailing myths about heroin's power and the
exposure controlled users have to addicts who have succumbed to
the drug. </p>

<p> Controlled using subjects observe common sanctions against
behaving like or becoming overly involved with junkies and
compulsive users. Controlled users may chastise one another for
manifesting irresponsible junkie-like behavior. Users who are
unable to control the drug's effects may be chastised. A user of
codeine-based cough syrup and of Doriden indicated that despite
the somnolence induced by these drugs, people are expected to act
responsibly&#151; &quot;One (cigarette) burn and you're thrown
out. &quot; Being cheated by dealers is a fact of life, but a
controlled user who cheats fellow users is punished by being
called a junkie. Controlled users frown upon spending too much
money on heroin because it suggests the junkie's lack of control:
&quot;Just 'cause I had the money don't necessary mean I would
cop . . . of course, I wouldn't steal to get the money to cop,
there's no need for it 'cause I don't have a habit.&quot; </p>

<p> Shooting up like a junkie is O.K., but shooting up with
junkies is not, because this symbolizes a loss of control. A
couple who had regular access to opiates through the woman's
addicted sister and brother-in-law stopped relying on them for
opiates because of the social pressure to use the drug with them.
They began borrowing a car and driving several miles to a copping
site in another city where they knew they could obtain heroin
from street dealers. </p>

<h3>DISCUSSION AND NEW DIRECTIONS</h3>
</center>

<p> Our findings show that, contrary to conventional wisdom,
controlled use of illicit drugs is possible and is fostered by
subcultural rituals and social sanctions that support controlled
use and curtail drug abuse. We have also observed how the
controlled use of alcohol is patterned by established, broad
based rituals and social sanctions. These findings and
observations strongly suggest that the evolution and widespread
acceptance of social controls for illicit drugs, similar to those
for alcohol, would provide a viable means of preventing drug
abuse. </p>

<p> Ironically, the present attempt to eliminate all use of
illicit drugs undermines users' ability to control them. Users
receive no assistance from the larger culture for control.
Instruction in how to use illicit drugs is now relegated to peer
using groups which are, at best, an inadequate substitute for
family-centered socialization. Association with controlled users
is as much a matter of chance as it is of personal choice.<a
name="back23"></a><a href="#note23"><sup>23</sup></a> Because
illicit drug use must be a covert activity, newcomers are not
presented with an array of using groups from which to choose.
Early in their using careers, many DAC subjects became involved
with groups in which members were not well schooled in controlled
use, or with groups in which compulsive use and risk-taking were
the norms. In both cases subjects went through periods when drug
use interfered with their ability to function and when they
frequently experienced untoward drug effects such as bad trips.
These individuals were later able to achieve controlled use, but
many are not. To revoke personal commitments and realign oneself
with new using companions is a difficult and again uncertain
process. </p>

<p> The culture's active opposition to illicit drug use also
alienates users from adult guidance. Asking adults for advice or
approval even in a guarded way is risky, and raises difficult
issues for parents and users alike. The deviant subcultures
become more attractive because they insulate the user from the
mainstream culture's disapproval and facilitate drug use. </p>

<p> Of course, the mainstream culture's opposition to illicit
drug use is not wholly negative in its effects. Present legal and
social sanctions do dissuade some people from taking these drugs
and no doubt influence others to abandon their use, thereby
preventing some unknown quantity of abuse. Unfortunately, it is
not clear how many people would take these drugs if they were
given an unobstructed choice about it, nor is it clear how many
would go on to become abusers. What is clear is that the attempt
to eliminate all use of these drugs contributes to their abuse by
people who take them. </p>

<p> It seems safe to assume that no matter how massive the
investments in law enforcement and education, neither the drugs
themselves nor people's interest in taking them will be
eliminated. There is every indication that illicit drug use will
continue to rise as it has over the last decade. Given this
prognosis and the failings and high social costs of our present
restrictive social policy, it seems not only reasonable but
necessary to place illicit drugs under social control so that
their abuse can be minimized. </p>

<p> Ideally, social management of drug use affords advantages
which prohibition does not. Drug use is normalized with other
life activities and is transformed from a covert to an overt
activity subject to the pressures of public scrutiny. Drug users
regulate themselves and other users . Social learning in proper (
controlled) drug use becomes available. Rituals and social
sanctions provide freedom to pursue a recreational activity,
albeit a complex and at times risky one, in an individualized way
while discouraging detrimental drug-using behavior. Drug-taking
loses its appeal as &quot;forbidden fruit.&quot; Users who
experience difficulties are more likely to seek assistance
because they can do so without having to declare themselves
deviant and morally bankrupt, and without the risk of punitive
reprisals. The quality of drugs can be regulated and thus,
untoward drug effects greatly reduced. </p>

<p> The chief difficulty in achieving social control over illicit
drugs is that enormous changes would have to occur in both public
attitude and social policy for effective controlling rituals and
social sanctions to develop. Rituals and social sanctions cannot
be supplied ready-made to drug users or potential users. We
would, therefore, not recommend wholesale immediate legalization
of marihuana, psychedelics, and the opiates precisely because too
abrupt a shift in policy would leave many users without the
elaborate social support needed to prevent abuse. </p>

<p> It is possible, however, </p>

<p> 1. to alleviate major legal obstacles to their development,
and </p>

<p> 2. to provide more comprehensive and value-neutral
information about licit and illicit drugs to the general
population, making more user/ non-user contact and discussion
possible and, in turn, permitting further dissemination of
controlling conventions. Some steps could be taken now which
would both strengthen the existing subcultural rituals and social
sanctions and serve to demystify the power and danger of these
drugs generally. </p>

<p> Certainly decriminalization of marihuana should be extended
beyond those few states which have adopted it, and federal
penalties for use should be dropped. Further research on the
possible medical applications of marihuana and the psychedelics
should be undertaken, and results sufficiently publicized so that
their public image as &quot;bad&quot; drugs can be dissipated.<a
name="back24"></a><a href="#note24"><sup>24</sup></a> Heroin
should be made available to physicians as a legitimate analgesic,
and experimentation with heroin maintenance clinics for the
treatment of addicts should also begin with careful control. </p>

<p> Drug education programs which are no more than disguised
campaigns to eliminate use should be replaced with genuine
efforts to provide users and non-users with some rudimentary
pharmacological data and with detailed information about the
consequences of various patterns of use. Doctors, teachers,
counselors, and others who encounter drug users should be
instructed in how to distinguish use from abuse&#151;it simply
makes no sense to alienate and undermine those segments of the
population of drug-takers who stand against abuse. </p>

<p> These recommendations represent the first in a number of
changes which would be required before illicit drugs could be
made available under minimal legal restraints. We cannot detail
here the entire sequence of such changes. In general, we
recommend that social policy keep better pace with developments
among drug users themselves than has so far been the case. </p>

<p> In closing, we suggest that the policy goals and changes we
have outlined are part of a larger historical process by which
drugs are gradually incorporated into a culture and by which use
replaces abuse as a dominant using pattern. Turning again to
alcohol as an example, in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries 75 to 80 per cent of those who drank were alcoholics
(Harrison, 1964) . A few decades ago alcohol use was prohibited
and the temperance movement pronounced it an evil and dangerous
substance. Today 95 per cent of those who drink are controlled
users. This figure might still be improved by further normalizing
and not glorifying alcohol use, e.g., by banning advertising
which relates alcohol use to sexual prowess. </p>

<p> In fact, illicit drugs are much further along in the process
of becoming acceptable and controllable than the culture has been
willing to acknowledge. If the incidence of untoward drug effects
is an indication, we can see clear movement with respect to
marihuana and the psychedelics. Becker (1963) notes that shortly
after World War I the incidence of &quot;panic reaction&quot; to
marihuana was higher than in the mid-1930's by which time
marihuana use had increased in a number of groups. Today, such
reactions are quite rare and are more typical of older (30+)
users who have had no prior experience with marihuana. A few
years ago the treatment of bad trips (resulting from use of
psychedelics) accounted for as much as 20 to 35 per cent of
hospital emergency admissions. Since that time psychedelic use
has grown at a faster rate than the use of any other illicit drug
( Drug Use in America, 1973), but the number of hospital
admissions has dropped markedly. As of July 1974 the
Massachusetts Mental Health Center did not know when they last
had such an admission, but they were sure that it had been years
rather than months ago (Grinspoon, 1974) . The Haight Ashbury
Free Medical Clinic, which furnishes emergency medical teams to
rock concerts, reports ( Smith, 1975) that at a recent concert
attended by some 10, 000 persons where psychedelics were openly
distributed only two adverse reactions came to the attention of
the medical team. In both cases, the patients were quickly
quieted by talking with members of the team and sent home after
fifteen to thirty minutes. A recent National Drug Abuse Council
Survey Project shows that the majority of college and high school
students who use drugs cannot be distinguished from many of those
who do not and never have used drugs (Yankelovich, Skelly &amp;
White, 1975, Yankelovich, 1975) . </p>

<p> These data suggest that the development of controlled using
patterns for illicit drugs by substantial numbers of users is
probably a recent occurrence. The legal system is not able to and
probably should not reflect every shift in using patterns. But,
if controlled using patterns stabilize, as our work indicates
they have for marihuana and the psychedelics, and viable social
sanctions which permit this use develop, then in time the laws
should respond to the new social position of the illicit drug and
the drug user. Obviously, it is difficult to develop rituals and
social sanctions which are against the law; both the drug user
and the public must tolerate a serious amount of ambiguity and
anxiety. The user takes real risks by breaking the law ( greater
risks than are imposed by the chemistry of the drugs ), and the
public suffers the disruptions of laws which now punish more than
they deter. </p>

<p> It does not seem likely that this situation will be rectified
immediately. However, it is possible to monitor changing using
patterns in order to determine how best to integrate these
changes into the legal system. Until now there has been
considerable resistance not only to legal changes but even to
recognition of changing drug-using patterns. The study and
dissemination of new information on how people develop successful
drug-using patterns can proceed without neglecting the study of
drug abuse when it occurs. Our work shows that controlled use of
illicit drugs exists in this country and is the result of
subcultural rituals and social sanctions. </p>

<p> <a name="note1"></a>1. The material for this paper was
gathered as part of a study of the social basis of drug abuse
prevention funded by The Drug Abuse Council, Inc. 1828 L Street,
N.W., Washington, D. C. The work of Richard C. Jacobson and
Deborah Patt on that study was invaluable to this paper. Since
July 1 1976 research on controlled use has continued under
National Institute on Drug Abuse Grant No. 1 R01 DA 01360-OlAl. <a

<p> <a name="note2"></a>2. &quot;In more tribal cultures social
sanctions are rarely institutionalized in a body of abstract law.
Principles of rightness which underlie the activities are largely
tacit And they are not the subject of much explicit criticism, or
even of very much reflective thought . . . Legislation, though it
may occur, is not the characteristic form of legal action&quot;
(Redfield, 1971). <a href="#back2">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note3"></a>3. Presumably drug use for religious
purposes, such as the use of peyote by members of the Native
American Church, would qualify as a ritual in the more classical
sense. <a href="#back3">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note4"></a>4. Wilkinson (1970) reviews the relevant
research in his Appendix A. Several references to Wilkinson
follow as his work on alcohol closely parallels our own on the
social determinants of controlled illicit drug use. <a

<p> <a name="note5"></a>5. In many families the formal offer of a
drink constitutes an important quasi-rite de passage from
adolescence to adulthood. <a href="#back5">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note6"></a>6. Research has shown that in abstinent
families where parallel conditions exist with respect to alcohol,
the potential for children becoming alcoholics is greatly
enhanced (Wilkinson, 1970, Appendix A). <a href="#back6">(back)</a>

<p> <a name="note7"></a>7. The MEDLINE file contains 400,000

<p> <a name="note8"></a>8. Indigenous data gatherers were trained
in interviewing technique. All interviews were tape recorded,
allowing research staff to monitor their work. Three of the data
gatherers were recruited from within the sample&#151;two women
and one man&#151;and proved extremely capable and reliable. They
contributed the bulk of the data which were not gathered by the
research staff. <a href="#back8">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note9"></a>9. Interviews have also been conducted
with approximately 20 non-controlled drug users. Especially at
the outset of the DAC study, potential subjects were referred to
us who turned out, in fact. to be compulsive users. Interviews
with these subjects provided valuable comparative data and were
used as a basis to refine the interview schedule. <a
href="#back9">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note10"></a>10. Further information on methods and
other aspects of our findings are reported elsewhere: (1) R. C.

<p> <a name="note11"></a>11. While the influence of personality,
family background, social class, availability of the drug, and
other variables on drug use could be traced for individual
subjects, no consistent relationship has been found between these
factors and controlled use. <a href="#back11">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note12"></a>12. Weil &amp; Zinberg (1968) found
differences in ability to control the drug high among naive and
experienced marihuana users in a controlled setting. Becker
(1963) observed that users' appreciation and control of the drug
high is learned; and that this learning allows the user to
function adequately while under the influence of marihuana. <a
href="#back12">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note13"></a>13. Users of the psychedelics and
opiates were also able to control their highs but found it more
difficult and usually limited use to protected settings. <a
href="#back13">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note14"></a>14. Most Americans view marihuana as an
illicit, &quot;bad&quot; drug, but as less &quot;bad&quot; than
heroin, LSD, cocaine, etc. <a href="#back14">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note15"></a>15. In effect, new users recapitulate
many of the elements of marihuana rituals of the early sixties in
their preliminary use of the drug. <a href="#back15">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note16"></a>16. We found it more difficult to locate
marihuana and psychedelic abusers than controlled users. This
situation was reversed for the opiates. <a href="#back16">(back)</a>
</p>

<p> <a name="note17"></a>17. Access to correctly labeled
psychedelics is confined to a few knowledgeable, experienced, and
wed connected users. One user in the DAC sample was able to
obtain psychedelics from a reputable source, and often had the
drugs tested by a chemist before use. <a href="#back17">(back)</a>
</p>

<p> <a name="note18"></a>18. There are substantive differences in
the high states induced by the various psychedelics, which are
beyond the scope of this article (Zinberg, 1974). <a
href="#back18">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note19"></a>19. Psychedelics are chemically related
to amphetamines. We are presuming here that these compulsive
users are, in fact, using psychedelics and not wrongly labeled
amphetamines. <a href="#back19">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note20"></a>20. Standing with the larger culture
against opiate use may help marihuana and psychedelic users to
view their own drug use as comparatively &quot;good&quot;. <a
href="#back20">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note21"></a>21. The preponderance of controlled
opiate subjects were heroin users who used dilaudid, codeine, and
other pharmaceutical opiates on an occasional basis. Only three
subjects did not use heroin ( see footnote following) .
Therefore, discussion will center on heroin use. <a
href="#back21">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note22"></a>22. Three controlled users had regular
access to opiates without going through a dealer: a physician who
used morphine; a hemophiliac who could obtain pharmaceuticals
from physicians under the pretense of relieving the pain of a
hematoma; a user, whose drug of choice was codeine, who obtained
cough syrup from a pharmacist willing to ignore existing legal
regulations. These cases are described in some detail in Zinberg
&amp; Jacobson (1975). <a href="#back22">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note23"></a>23. This is less true for marihuana
users than for psychedelic and opiate users. <a href="#back23">(back)</a>
</p>

<p> <a name="note24"></a>24. We are not assuming that the results
of this research will be uniformly positive. Whatever the
results. by making these drugs the object of medical research the
idea that no drug is inherently &quot;good&quot; or
&quot;bad&quot;, that any drug can be used in a variety of ways,
would be advanced. <a href="#back24">(back)</a> </p>

<h2>Culture and the Individual</h2>

<h3>Aldous Huxley</h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p> BETWEEN CULTURE and the individual the relationship is, and
always has been, strangely ambivalent. We are at once the
beneficiaries of our culture and its victims. Without culture,
and without that precondition of all culture, language, man would
be no more than another species of baboon. It is to language and
culture that we owe our humanity. And &quot;What a piece of work
is a man!&quot; says Hamlet: &quot;How noble in reason! how
infinite in faculties! . . . in action how like an angel! in
apprehension, how like a god!&quot; But, alas, in the intervals
of being noble, rational and potentially infinite, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>man, proud man,<br>
    Dressed in a little brief authority,<br>
    Most ignorant of what he is most assured,<br>
    His glassy essence, like an angry ape,<br>
    Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven<br>
    As make the angels weep.</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Genius and angry ape, player of fantastic
tricks and godlike reasoner&#151;in all these roles individuals
are the products of a language and a culture. Working on the
twelve or thirteen billion neurons of a human brain, language and
culture have given us law, science, ethics, philosophy; have made
possible all the achievements of talent and of sanctity. They
have also given us fanaticism, superstition and dogmatic
bumptiousness; nationalistic idolatry and mass murder in the name
of God; rabble-rousing propaganda and organized Iying. And, along
with the salt of the earth, they have given us, generation after
generation, countless millions of hypnotized conformists, the
predestined victims of power-hungry rulers who are themselves the
victims of all that is most senseless and inhuman in their
cultural tradition.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks to language and culture, human behavior can
be incomparably more intelligent, more original, creative and
flexible than the behavior of animals, whose brains are too small
to accommodate the number of neurons necessary for the invention
of language and the transmission of accumulated knowledge. But,
thanks again to language and culture, human beings often behave
with a stupidity, a lack of realism, a total inappropriateness,
of which animals are incapable.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Trobriand Islander or Bostonian, Sicilian Catholic
or Japanese Buddhist, each of us is born into some culture and
passes his life within its confines. Between every human
consciousness and the rest of the world stands an invisible
fence, a network of traditional thinking-and-feeling patterns, of
secondhand notions that have turned into axioms, of ancient
slogans revered as divine revelations. What we see through the
meshes of this net is never, of course, the unknowable
&quot;thing in itself.&quot; It is not even, in most cases, the
thing as it impinges upon our senses and as our organism
spontaneously reacts to it. What we ordinarily take in and
respond to is a curious mixture of immediate experience with
culturally conditioned symbol, of sense impressions with
preconceived ideas about the nature of things. And by most people
the symbolic elements in this cocktail of awareness are felt to
be more important than the elements contributed by immediate
experience. Inevitably so, for, to those who accept their culture
totally and uncritically, words in the familiar language do not
stand (however inadequately) for things. On the contrary, things
stand for familiar words. Each unique event of their ongoing life
is instantly and automatically classified as yet another concrete
illustration of one of the verbalized, culture-hallowed
abstractions drummed into their heads by childhood conditioning.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It goes without saying that many of the ideas
handed down to us by the transmitters of culture are eminently
sensible and realistic. (If they were not, the human species
would now be extinct.) But, along with these useful concepts,
every culture hands down a stock of unrealistic notions, some of
which never made any sense, while others may once have possessed
survival value, but have now, in the changed and changing
circumstances of ongoing history, become completely irrelevant.
Since human beings respond to symbols as promptly and
unequivocally as they respond to the stimuli of unmediated
experience, and since most of them naively believe that
culture-hallowed words about things are as real as, or even
realer than their perceptions of the things themselves, these
outdated or intrinsically nonsensical notions do enormous harm.
Thanks to the realistic ideas handed down by culture, mankind has
survived and, in certain fields, progresses. But thanks to the
pernicious nonsense drummed into every individual in the course
of his acculturation, mankind, though surviving and progressing,
has always been in trouble. History is the record, among other
things, of the fantastic and generally fiendish tricks played
upon itself by culture-maddened humanity. And the hideous game
goes on.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What can, and what should, the individual do to
improve his ironically equivocal relationship with the culture in
which he finds himself embedded? How can he continue to enjoy the
benefits of culture without, at the same time, being stupefied or
frenziedly intoxicated by its poisons? How can he become
discriminatingly acculturated, rejecting what is silly or
downright evil in his conditioning, and holding fast to that
which makes for humane and intelligent behavior?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A culture cannot be discriminatingly accepted, much
less be modified, except by persons who have seen through
it&#151;by persons who have cut holes in the confining stockade
of verbalized symbols and so are able to look at the world and,
by reflection, at themselves in a new and relatively unprejudiced
way. Such persons are not merely born; they must also be made.
But how?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the field of formal education, what the would-be
hole cutter needs is knowledge. Knowledge of the past and present
history of cultures in all their fantastic variety, and knowledge
about the nature and limitations, the uses and abuses, of
language. A man who knows that there have been many cultures, and
that each culture claims to be the best and truest of all, will
find it hard to take too seriously the boastings and dogmatizings
of his own tradition. Similarly, a man who knows how symbols are
related to experience, and who practices the kind of linguistic
self- control taught by the exponents of General Semantics, is
unlikely to take too seriously the absurd or dangerous nonsense
that, within every culture, passes for philosophy, practical
wisdom and political argument. As a preparation for hole cutting,
this kind of intellectual education is certainly valuable, but no
less certainly insufficient. Training on the verbal level needs
to be supplemented by training in wordless experiencing. We must
learn how to be mentally silent, must cultivate the art of pure
receptivity.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To be silently receptive&#151;how childishly simple
that seems! But in fact, as we very soon discover, how difficult!
The universe in which men pass their lives is the creation of
what Indian philosophy calls <i>Nama-Rupa</i>, Name and Form.
Reality is a continuum, a fathomlessly mysterious and infinite
Something, whose outward aspect is what we call Matter and whose
inwardness is what we call Mind. Language is a device for taking
the mystery out of Reality and making it amenable to human
comprehension and manipulation. Acculturated man breaks up the
continuum, attaches labels to a few of the fragments, projects
the labels into the outside world and thus creates for himself an
all-too-human universe of separate objects, each of which is
merely the embodiment of a name, a particular illustration of
some traditional abstraction. What we perceive takes on the
pattern of the conceptual lattice through which it has been
filtered. Pure receptivity is difficult because man's normal
waking consciousness is always culturally conditioned. But normal
waking consciousness, as William James pointed out many years
ago, &quot;is but one type of consciousness, while all about it,
parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential
forms of consciousness entirely different. We may go through life
without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite
stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their
completeness, definite types of mentality which probably
somewhere have their field of application and adaptation. No
account of the universe in its totality can be final which leaves
these forms of consciousness disregarded.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like the culture by which it is conditioned, normal
waking consciousness is at once our best friend and a most
dangerous enemy. It helps us to survive and make progress; but at
the same time it prevents us from actualizing some of our most
valuable potentialities and, on occasion, gets us into all kinds
of trouble. To become fully human, man, proud man, the player of
fantastic tricks, must learn to get out of his own way: only then
will his infinite faculties and angelic apprehension get a chance
of coming to the surface. In Blake's words, we must &quot;cleanse
the doors of perception&quot;; for when the doors of perception
are cleansed, &quot;everything appears to man as it
is&#151;infinite.&quot; To normal waking consciousness things are
the strictly finite and insulated embodiments of verbal labels.
How can we break the habit of automatically imposing our
prejudices and the memory of culture-hallowed words upon
immediate experience? Answer: by the practice of pure receptivity
and mental silence. These will cleanse the doors of perception
and, in the process, make possible the emergence of other than
normal forms of consciousness&#151;aesthetic consciousness,
visionary consciousness, mystical consciousness. Thanks to
culture we are the heirs to vast accumulations of knowledge, to a
priceless treasure of logical and scientific method, to thousands
upon thousands of useful pieces of technological and
organizational know-how. But the human mind-body possesses other
sources of information, makes use of other types of reasoning, is
gifted with an intrinsic wisdom that is independent of cultural
conditioning.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wordsworth writes that &quot;our meddling intellect
[that part of the mind which uses language to take the mystery
out of Reality] mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things: we
murder to dissect.&quot; Needless to say, we cannot get along
without our meddling intellect. Verbalized conceptual thinking is
indispensable. But even when they are used well, verbalized
concepts mis-shape &quot;the beauteous forms of things.&quot; And
when (as happens so often) they are used badly, they mis-shape
our lives by rationalizing ancient stupidities, by instigating
mass murder, persecution and the playing of all the other
fantastically ugly tricks that make the angels weep. Wise
nonverbal passiveness is an antidote to unwise verbal activity
and a necessary corrective to wise verbal activity. Verbalized
concepts about experience need to be supplemented by direct,
unmediated acquaintance with events as they present themselves to
us.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is the old story of the letter and the spirit.
The letter is necessary, but must never be taken too seriously,
for, divorced from the spirit, it cramps and finally kills. As
for the spirit, it &quot;bloweth where it listeth&quot; and, if
we fail to consult the best cultural charts, we may be blown off
our course and suffer shipwreck. At present most of us make the
worst of both worlds. Ignoring the freely blowing winds of the
spirit and relying on cultural maps which may be centuries
out-of- date, we rush full speed ahead under the high-pressure
steam of our own overweening self- confidence. The tickets we
have sold ourselves assure us that our destination is some port
in the Islands of the Blest. In fact it turns out, more often
than not, to be Devil's Island.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Self-education on the nonverbal level is as old as
civilization. &quot;Be still and know that I am
God&quot;&#151;for the visionaries and mystics of every time and
every place, this has been the first and greatest of the
commandments. Poets listen to their Muse and in the same way the
visionary and the mystic wait upon inspiration in a state of wise
passiveness, of dynamic vacuity. In the Western tradition this
state is called &quot;the prayer of simple regard.&quot; At the
other end of the world it is described in terms that are
psychological rather than theistic. In mental silence we
&quot;look into our own Self-Nature,&quot; we &quot;hold fast to
the Not-Thought which lies in thought.&quot; we &quot;become that
which essentially we have always been.&quot; By wise activity we
can acquire useful analytical knowledge about the world,
knowledge that can be communicated by means of verbal symbols. In
the state of wise passiveness we make possible the emergence of
forms of consciousness other than the utilitarian consciousness
of normal waking life. Useful analytical knowledge about the
world is replaced by some kind of biologically inessential but
spiritually enlightening acquaintance with the world. For
example, there can be direct aesthetic acquaintance with the
world as beauty. Or there can be direct acquaintance with the
intrinsic strangeness of existence, its wild implausibility. And
finally there can be direct acquaintance with the world's unity.
This immediate mystical experience of being at one with the
fundamental Oneness that manifests itself in the infinite
diversity of things and minds, can never be adequately expressed
in words. Like visionary experience, the experience of the mystic
can be talked about only from the outside. Verbal symbols can
never convey its inwardness.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is through mental silence and the practice of
wise passiveness that artists, visionaries and mystics have made
themselves ready for the immediate experience of the world as
beauty, as mystery and as unity. But silence and wise passiveness
are not the only roads leading out of the all-too-human universe
created by normal, culture-conditioned consciousness. In <i>Expostulation
and Reply,</i> Wordsworth's bookish friend, Matthew, reproaches
the poet because </p>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>You look round on your Mother Earth,<br>
    As if she for no purpose bore you;<br>
    As if you were her first-born birth,<br>
    And none have lived before you!</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> From the point of view of normal waking consciousness, this
is sheer intellectual delinquency. But it is what the artist, the
visionary and the mystic must do and, in fact, have always done.
&quot;Look at a person, a landscape, any common object, as though
you were seeing it for the first time.&quot; This is one of the
exercises in immediate, unverbalized awareness prescribed in the
ancient texts of Tantric Buddhism. Artists visionaries and
mystics refuse to be enslaved to the culture-conditioned habits
of feeling, thought and action which their society regards as
right and natural. Whenever this seems desirable, they
deliberately refrain from projecting upon reality those hallowed
word patterns with which all human minds are so copiously
stocked. They know as well as anyone else that culture and the
language in which any given culture is rooted, are absolutely
necessary and that, without them, the individual would not be
human. But more vividly than the rest of mankind they also know
that, to be <i>fully</i> human, the individual must learn to
decondition himself, must be able to cut holes in the fence of
verbalized symbols that hems him in.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the exploration of the vast and mysterious world
of human potentialities the great artists, visionaries and
mystics have been trailblazing pioneers. But where they have
been, others can follow. Potentially, all of us are
&quot;infinite in faculties and like gods in apprehension.&quot;
Modes of consciousness different from normal waking consciousness
are within the reach of anyone who knows how to apply the
necessary stimuli. The universe in which a human being lives can
be transfigured into a new creation. We have only to cut a hole
in the fence and look around us with what the philosopher,
Plotinus, describes as &quot;that other kind of seeing, which
everyone has but few make use of.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Within our current systems of education, training
on the nonverbal level is meager in quantity and poor in quality.
Moreover, its purpose, which is simply to help its recipients to
be more &quot;like gods in apprehension&quot; is neither clearly
stated nor consistently pursued. We could and, most emphatically,
we should do better in this very important field than we are
doing now. The practical wisdom of earlier civilizations and the
findings of adventurous spirits within our own tradition and in
our own time are freely available. With their aid a curriculum
and a methodology of nonverbal training could be worked out
without much difficulty. Unhappily most persons in authority have
a vested interest in the maintenance of cultural fences. They
frown upon hole cutting as subversive and dismiss Plotinus'
&quot;other kind of seeing&quot; as a symptom of mental
derangement. If an effective system of nonverbal education could
be worked out, would the authorities allow it to be widely
applied? It is an open question.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From the nonverbal world of culturally
uncontaminated consciousness we pass to the subverbal world of
physiology and biochemistry. A human being is a temperament and a
product of cultural conditioning; he is also, and primarily, an
extremely complex and delicate biochemical system, whose
inwardness, as the system changes from one state of equilibrium
to another, is changing consciousness. It is because each one of
us is a biochemical system that (according to Housman) </p>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>Malt does more than Milton can<br>
    To justify God's ways to man.</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Beer achieves its theological triumphs because, in William
James' words, &quot;Drunkenness is the great exciter of the Yes
function in man.&quot; And he adds that &quot;It is part of the
deeper mystery and tragedy of life that whiffs and gleams of
something that we immediately recognize as excellent should be
vouchsafed to so many of us only in the fleeting earlier phases
of what, in its totality, is so degrading a poisoning.&quot; The
tree is known by its fruits, and the fruits of too much reliance
upon ethyl alcohol as an exciter of the Yes function are bitter
indeed. No less bitter are the fruits of reliance upon such
habit-forming sedatives, hallucinogens and mood elevators as
opium and its derivatives, as cocaine (once so blithely
recommended to his friends and patients by Dr. Freud), as the
barbiturates and amphetamine. But in recent years the
pharmacologists have extracted or synthesized several compounds
that powerfully affect the mind without doing any harm to the
body, either at the time of ingestion or, through addiction,
later on. Through these new psychedelics, the subject's normal
waking consciousness may be modified in many different ways. It
is as though, for each individual, his deeper self decides which
kind of experience will be most advantageous. Having decided, it
makes use of the drug's mind-changing powers to give the person
what he needs. Thus, if it would be good for him to have deeply
buried memories uncovered, deeply buried memories will duly be
uncovered. In cases where this is of no great importance,
something else will happen. Normal waking consciousness may be
replaced by aesthetic consciousness, and the world will be
perceived in all its unimaginable beauty, all the blazing
intensity of its &quot;thereness.&quot; And aesthetic
consciousness may modulate into visionary consciousness. Thanks
to yet another kind of seeing, the world will now reveal itself
as not only unimaginably beautiful, but also fathomlessly
mysterious&#151;as a multitudinous abyss of possibility forever
actualizing itself into unprecedented forms. New insights into a
new, transfigured world of givenness, new combinations of thought
and fantasy&#151;the stream of novelty pours through the world in
a torrent, whose every drop is charged with meaning. There are
the symbols whose meaning lies outside themselves in the given
facts of visionary experience, and there are these given facts
which signify only themselves. But &quot;only themselves&quot; is
also &quot;no less than the divine ground of all being.&quot;
&quot;Nothing but this&quot; is at the same time &quot;the
Suchness of all.&quot; And now the aesthetic and the visionary
consciousness deepen into mystical consciousness. The world is
now seen as an infinite diversity that is yet a unity, and the
beholder experiences himself as being at one with the infinite
Oneness that manifests itself, totally present, at every point of
space, at every instant in the flux of perpetual perishing and
perpetual renewal. Our normal word-conditioned consciousness
creates a universe of sharp distinctions, black and white, this
and that, me and you and it. In the mystical consciousness of
being at one with infinite Oneness, there is a reconciliation of
opposites, a perception of the Not- Particular in particulars, a
transcending of our ingrained subject4bject relationships with
things and persons; there is an immediate experience of our
solidarity with all being and a kind of organic conviction that
in spite of the inscrutabilities of fate, in spite of our own
dark stupidities and deliberate malevolence, yes, in spite of all
that is so manifestly wrong with the world, it is yet, in some
profound, paradoxical and entirely inexpressible way, All Right.
For normal waking consciousness, the phrase, &quot;God is
Love,&quot; is no more than a piece of wishful positive thinking.
For the mystical consciousness, it is a self-evident truth.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unprecedentedly rapid technological and demographic
changes are steadily increasing the dangers by which we are
surrounded, and at the same time are steadily diminishing the
relevance of the traditional feeling-and-behavior-patterns
imposed upon all individuals, rulers and ruled alike, by their
culture. Always desirable, widespread training in the art of
cutting holes in cultural fences is now the most urgent of
necessities. Can such a training be speeded up and made more
effective by a judicious use of the physically harmless
psychedelics now available? On the basis of personal experience
and the published evidence, I believe that it can. In my utopian
fantasy, <i>Island,</i> I speculated in fictional terms about the
ways in which a substance akin to psilocybin could be used to
potentiate the nonverbal education of adolescents and to remind
adults that the real world is very different from the misshapen
universe they have created for themselves by means of their
culture-conditioned prejudices. &quot;Having Fun with
Fungi&quot;&#151;that was how one waggish reviewer dismissed the
matter. But which is better: to have Fun with Fungi or to have
Idiocy with Ideology, to have Wars because of Words, to have
Tomorrow's Misdeeds out of Yesterday's Miscreeds?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How should the psychedelics be administered? Under
what circumstances, with what kind of preparation and follow-up?
These are questions that must be answered empirically, by
large-scale experiment. Man's collective mind has a high degree
of viscosity and flows from one position to another with the
reluctant deliberation of an ebbing tide of sludge. But in a
world of explosive population increase, of headlong technological
advance and of militant nationalism, the time at our disposal is
strictly limited. We must discover, and discover very soon, new
energy sources for overcoming our society's psychological
inertia, better solvents for liquefyingthe sludgy stickiness of
an anachronistic state of mind. On the verbal level an education
in the nature and limitations, the uses and abuses of language;
on the wordless level an education in mental silence and pure
receptivity; and finally, through the use of harmless
psychedelics, a course of chemically triggered conversion
experiences or ecstasies&#151;these, I believe, will provide all
the sources of mental energy, all the solvents of conceptual
sludge, that an individual requires. With their aid, he should be
able to adapt himself selectively to his culture, rejecting its
evils, stupidities and irrelevances, gratefully accepting all its
treasures of accumulated knowledge, of rationality,
human-heartedness and practical wisdom. If the number of such
individuals is sufficiently great, if their quality is
sufficiently high, they may be able to pass from discriminating
acceptance of their culture to discriminating change and reform.
Is this a hopefully utopian dream? Experiment can give us the
answer, for the dream is pragmatic; the utopian hypotheses can be
tested empirically. And in these oppressive times a little hope
is surely no unwelcome visitant. </p>
