  For Immediate Release                         November 15, 1996



<PRE>
                        TEXT OF A LETTER FROM
                   THE PRESIDENT TO THE SPEAKER OF
                   THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
                     THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE
</PRE>


<P>
                          November 15, 1996



<P>
  Dear Mr. Speaker:     (Dear Mr. President:)

<P>
  In order to take additional steps with respect to the
  national emergency described and declared in Executive
  Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and continued on August 15,
  1995, and August 14, 1996, necessitated by the expiration of
  the Export Administration Act (EAA) on August 20, 1994, I hereby
  report to the Congress that pursuant to section 204(b) of the
  International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b)
  (the "Act"), I have today exercised the authority granted by the
  Act to issue an Executive order (a copy of which is attached) to
  revise the provisions that apply to the administration of the
  export control system maintained by Department of Commerce in
  the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Part 730 et seq.

<P>
  The new Executive order relates to my decision to transfer
  certain encryption products from the United States Munitions
  List administered by the Department of State to the Commerce
  Control List administered by the Department of Commerce.
  When I made that decision I also decided to amend Executive
  Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, which sets forth procedures
  for the interagency review and disposition of dual-use export
  license applications, to include the Department of Justice
  among the agencies that have the opportunity to review such
  applications with respect to encryption products transferred
  to Department of Commerce control.

<P>
  Also, in issuing the new order, I provided for appropriate
  controls on the export and foreign dissemination of encryption
  products transferred to the Department of Commerce.  Among
  other provisions, I determined that the export of encryption
  products transferred to Department of Commerce control could
  harm national security and foreign policy interests of the
  United States even where comparable products are or appear to
  be available from foreign sources.  Accordingly, the new order
  makes clear that any EAA provision dealing with issuance of
  licenses or removal of controls based on foreign availability
  considerations shall not apply with respect to export controls
  on such encryption products.  Notwithstanding this, the
  Secretary of Commerce retains the discretion to consider the
  foreign availability of comparable encryption products in any
  particular case.

<P>
                                Sincerely,


<P>
<STRONG>WILLIAM J. CLINTON</STRONG>

                    TECHNOLOGY POLICY

  SUBJECT:       Encryption Export Policy
</PRE>


<P>
  Encryption products, when used outside the United States, can
  jeopardize our foreign policy and national security interests.
  Moreover, such products, when used by international criminal
  organizations, can threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here
  and abroad, as well as the safety of the citizens of other
  countries.  The exportation of encryption products accordingly
  must be controlled to further U.S. foreign policy objectives,
  and promote our national security, including the protection of
  the safety of U.S. citizens abroad.  Nonetheless, because of
  the increasingly widespread use of encryption products for the
  legitimate protection of the privacy of data and communications
  in nonmilitary contexts; because of the importance to U.S.
  economic interests of the market for encryption products;
  and because, pursuant to the terms set forth in the Executive
  order entitled Administration of Export Controls on Encryption
  Products (the "new Executive order") of November 15, 1996,
  Commerce Department controls of the export of such dual-use
  encryption products can be accomplished without compromising
  U.S. foreign policy objectives and national security interests,
  I have determined at this time not to continue to designate such
  encryption products as defense articles on the United States
  Munitions List.

<P>
  Accordingly, under the powers vested in me by the Constitution
  and the laws of the United States, I direct that:

<OL>
  <LI> Encryption products that presently are or would be
  designated in Category XIII of the United States Munitions
  List and regulated by the Department of State pursuant to
  the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq.) shall
  be transferred to the Commerce Control List, and regulated
  by the Department of Commerce under the authority conferred

</OL>

<P>
<STRONG>(OVER)</STRONG>

<P>
                                  2

<P>
  in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994 (as continued on
  August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996), Executive Order 12981
  of December 5, 1995, and the new Executive order except
  that encryption products specifically designed, developed,
  configured, adapted, or modified for military applications
  (including command, control, and intelligence applications),
  shall continue to be designated as defense articles, shall
  remain on the United States Munitions List, and shall continue
  to be controlled under the Arms Export Control Act.  The
  transfer described in this paragraph shall be effective upon
  the issuance of final regulations (the "Final Regulations")
  implementing the safeguards specified in this directive and
  in the new Executive order.

<P>
  2.  The Final Regulations shall specify that the encryption
  products specified in section 1 of this memorandum shall be
  placed on the Commerce Control List administered by the
  Department of Commerce.  The Department of Commerce shall,
  to the extent permitted by law, administer the export of such
  encryption products, including encryption software, pursuant
  to the requirements of sections 5 and 6 of the former Export
  Administration Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the
  regulations thereunder, as continued in effect by Executive
  Order 12924 of August 19, 1994 (continued on August 15, 1995,
  and on August 14, 1996), except as otherwise indicated in or
  modified by the new Executive order, Executive Order 12981 of
  December 5, 1995, and any Executive orders and laws cited
  therein.

<P>
  3.  The Final Regulations shall provide that encryption
  products described in section 1 of this memorandum can be
  licensed for export only if the requirements of the controls
  of both sections 5 and 6 of the former Export Administration
  Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the regulations
  thereunder, as modified by the new Executive order, Executive
  Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, and any Executive orders
  and laws cited therein, are satisfied.  Consistent with
  section 742.1(f) of the current Export Administration
  Regulations, the Final Regulations shall ensure that a license
  for such a product will be issued only if an application can
  be and is approved under both section 5 and section 6.  The
  controls on such products will apply to all destinations.
  Except for those products transferred to the Commerce Control
  List prior to the effective date of the Final Regulations,
  exports and reexports of encryption products shall initially be
  subject to case-by-case review to ensure that export thereof
  would be consistent with U.S. foreign policy objectives and
  national security interests, including the safety of U.S.
  citizens.  Consideration shall be given to more liberalized
  licensing treatment of each such individual product after
  interagency review is completed.  The Final Regulations shall
  also effectuate all other specific objectives and directives set
  forth in this directive.

<P>
  4.  Because encryption source code can easily and mechanically
  be transformed into object code, and because export of such
  source code is controlled because of the code's functional
  capacity, rather than because of any "information" such code
  might convey, the Final Regulations shall specify that
  encryption source code shall be treated as an encryption
  product, and not as technical data or technology, for export
  licensing purposes.

<P>
  5.  All provisions in the Final Regulations regarding
  "de minimis" domestic content of items shall not apply with
  respect to the encryption products described in paragraph 1
  of this memorandum.

<P>
                                 more

<P>
                                  3

<P>
  6.  The Final Regulations shall, in a manner consistent with
  section 16(5)(C) of the EAA, 50 U.S.C. App. 2415(5)(C), provide
  that it will constitute an export of encryption source code
  or object code software for a person to make such software
  available for transfer outside the United States, over radio,
  electromagnetic, photooptical, or photoelectric communications
  facilities accessible to persons outside the United States,
  including transfer from electronic bulletin boards and Internet
  file transfer protocol sites, unless the party making the
  software available takes precautions adequate to prevent the
  unauthorized transfer of such code outside the United States.

<P>
  7.  Until the Final Regulations are issued, the Department of
  State shall continue to have authority to administer the export
  of encryption products described in section 1 of this memorandum
  as defense articles designated in Category XIII of the United
  States Munitions List, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act.

<P>
  8.  Upon enactment of any legislation reauthorizing the
  administration of export controls, the Secretary of Defense,
  the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General shall reexamine
  whether adequate controls on encryption products can be
  maintained under the provisions of the new statute and advise
  the Secretary of Commerce of their conclusions as well as any
  recommendations for action.  If adequate controls on encryption
  products cannot be maintained under a new statute, then such
  products shall, where consistent with law, be designated or
  redesignated as defense articles under 22 U.S.C. 2778(a)(1),
  to be placed on the United States Munitions List and controlled
  pursuant to the terms of the Arms Export Control Act and the
  International Traffic in Arms Regulations.  Any disputes
  regarding the decision to designate or redesignate shall be
  resolved by the President.

<P>
<STRONG>EXECUTIVE ORDER</STRONG>

<HR>

<P>
<STRONG>ADMINISTRATION OF EXPORT CONTROLS ON ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS</STRONG>


<P>
       By the authority vested in me as President by the
  Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
  including but not limited to the International Emergency
  Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), and in order to
  take additional steps with respect to the national emergency
  described and declared in Executive Order 12924 of August 19,
  1994, and continued on August 15, 1995, and on August 14, 1996,
  I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of
  America, have decided that the provisions set forth below shall
  apply to administration of the export control system maintained
  by the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Part 730
  et seq. ("the EAR").  Accordingly, it is hereby ordered as
  follows:

<P>
       Section 1.  Treatment of Encryption Products.  In order
  to provide for appropriate controls on the export and foreign
  dissemination of encryption products, export controls of
  encryption products that are or would be, on this date,
  designated as defense articles in Category XIII of the
  United States Munitions List and regulated by the United States
  Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act,
  22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq. ("the AECA"), but that subsequently are
  placed on the Commerce Control List in the EAR, shall be subject
  to the following conditions:  (a)  I have determined that the
  export of encryption products described in this section could
  harm national security and foreign policy interests even where
  comparable products are or appear to be available from sources
  outside the United States, and that facts and questions
  concerning the foreign availability of such encryption products
  cannot be made subject to public disclosure or judicial review
  without revealing or implicating classified information that
  could harm United States national security and foreign policy
  interests.  Accordingly, sections 4(c) and 6(h)(2)-(4) of
  the Export Administration Act of 1979 ("the EAA"), 50 U.S.C.
  App. 2403(c) and 2405(h)(2)-(4), as amended and as continued
  in effect by Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and
  by notices of August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996, all
  other analogous provisions of the EAA relating to foreign
  availability, and the regulations in the EAR relating to such
  EAA provisions, shall not be applicable with respect to export
  controls on such encryption products.  Notwithstanding this,
  the Secretary of Commerce ("Secretary") may, in his discretion,
  consider the foreign availability of comparable encryption
  products in determining whether to issue a license in a
  particular case or to remove controls on particular products,
  but is not required to issue licenses in particular cases or
  to remove controls on particular products based on such
  consideration;

<P>
       (b)  Executive Order 12981, as amended by Executive
  Order 13020 of October 12, 1996, is further amended as follows:

<P>
       (1)  A new section 6 is added to read as follows:
  "Sec. 6.  Encryption Products.  In conducting the license
  review described in section 1 above, with respect to export
  controls of encryption products that are or would be, on
  November 15, 1996, designated as defense articles in Category

<P>
<STRONG>(OVER)</STRONG>

<P>
                                  2

<P>
  XIII of the United States Munitions List and regulated by the
  United States Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export
  Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq., but that subsequently are
  placed on the Commerce Control List in the Export Administration
  Regulations, the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, and
  Justice and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency shall have
  the opportunity to review any export license application
  submitted to the Department of Commerce.  The Department of
  Justice shall, with respect to such encryption products, be a
  voting member of the Export Administration Review Board
  described in section 5(a)(1) of this order and of the Advisory
  Committee on Export Policy described in section 5(a)(2) of this
  order.  The Department of Justice shall be a full member of the
  Operating Committee of the ACEP described in section 5(a)(3) of
  this order, and of any other committees and consultation groups
  reviewing export controls with respect to such encryption
  products."

<P>
       (2)  Sections 6 and 7 of Executive Order 12981 of
  December 5, 1995, are renumbered as new sections 7 and 8,
  respectively.

<P>
       (c)  Because the export of encryption software, like the
  export of other encryption products described in this section,
  must be controlled because of such software's functional
  capacity, rather than because of any possible informational
  value of such software, such software shall not be considered
  or treated as "technology," as that term is defined in
  section 16 of the EAA (50 U.S.C. App. 2415) and in the EAR
  (61 Fed. Reg. 12714, March 25, 1996);

<P>
       (d)  With respect to encryption products described in this
  section, the Secretary shall take such actions, including the
  promulgation of rules, regulations, and amendments thereto, as
  may be necessary to control the export of assistance (including
  training) to foreign persons in the same manner and to the same
  extent as the export of such assistance is controlled under the
  AECA, as amended by section 151 of Public Law 104-164;

<P>
       (e)  Appropriate controls on the export and foreign
  dissemination of encryption products described in this section
  may include, but are not limited to, measures that promote the
  use of strong encryption products and the development of a key
  recovery management infrastructure; and

<P>
       (f)  Regulation of encryption products described in this
  section shall be subject to such further conditions as the
  President may direct.

<P>
       Sec. 2.  Effective Date.  The provisions described in
  section 1 shall take effect as soon as any encryption products
  described in section 1 are placed on the Commerce Control List
  in the EAR.

<P>
       Sec. 3.  Judicial Review.  This order is intended only to
  improve the internal management of the executive branch and to
  ensure the implementation of appropriate controls on the export
  and foreign dissemination of encryption products.  It is not
  intended to, and does not, create any rights to administrative
  or judicial review, or any other right or benefit or trust
  responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable
  by a party against the United States, its agencies or
  instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other
  person.

<title>Gottschalk v. Benson</title>
<body>

<p><center>
<h1><strong>Gottschalk v. Benson </strong></h1>
Supreme Court of the United States<br>
409 U.S. 63<br>
1972
</center>

<p>Mr. Justice Douglas delivered the opinion of
the Court.

<p>Respondents filed in the Patent Office an application for an invention
which was described as being related ``to the processing of data by
program and more particularly to the programmed conversion of
numerical information'' in general-purpose digital computers.  They
claimed a method for converting binary-coded decimal (BCD) numerals
into pure binary numerals.  The claims were not limited to any
particular art or technology, to any particular apparatus or
machinery, or to any particular end use.  They purported to cover any
use of the claimed method in a general-purpose digital computer of any
type.  Claims 8 and 13<a name="F1"><a href="#FN1"><sup><fontsize=-2>1</font></sup></a></a> were rejected by the Patent Office but sustained by the
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 441 F.2d 682. The case is here on
a petition for a writ of certiorari.  405 U.S. 915.
 
   The question is whether the method described and claimed is a
``process'' within the meaning of the Patent
Act.<a name="F2"><a href="#FN2"><sup><fontsize=-2>2</font></sup></a></a>

<p>A digital computer, as distinguished from an analog computer, operates
on data expressed in digits, solving a problem by doing arithmetic as
a person would do it by head and hand.<a name="F3"><a href="#FN3"><sup><fontsize=-2>3</font></sup></a></a> Some of the digits are
stored as components of the computer.  Others are introduced into the
computer in a form which it is designed to recognize.  The computer
operates then upon both new and previously stored data.  The
general-purpose computer is designed to perform operations under many
different programs.
 
   The representation of numbers may be in the form of a time series
of electrical impulses, magnetized spots on the surface of tapes,
drums, or discs, charged spots on cathode-ray tube screens, the
presence or absence of punched holes on paper cards, or other devices.
The method or program is a sequence of coded instructions for a
digital computer.

<p>   The patent sought is on a method of programming a general-purpose
digital computer to convert signals from binary-coded decimal form
into pure binary form.  A procedure for solving a given type of
mathematical problem is known as an ``algorithm.'' The procedures set
forth in the present claims are of that kind; that is to say, they are
a generalized formulation for programs to solve mathematical problems
of converting one form of numerical representation to another.  From
the generic formulation, programs may be developed as specific
applications.

<p>The decimal system uses as digits the 10 symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, and 9.  The value represented by any digit depends, as it
does in any positional system of notation, both on its individual
value and on its relative position in the numeral.  Decimal numerals
are written by placing digits in the appropriate positions or columns
of the numerical sequence, <em>i. e.</em>, ``unit''
10<sup><fontsize=-2>0</fontsize></sup>, ``tens'' 10<sup><fontsize=-2>1</fontsize></sup>,
``hundreds'' 10<sup><fontsize=-2>2</fontsize></sup>, ``thousands'' 10<sup><fontsize=-2>3</fontsize></sup>, etc.  Accordingly, the
numeral 1492 signifies (1 x 10<sup><fontsize=-2>3</fontsize></sup>) + (4 x 10<sup><fontsize=-2>2</fontsize></sup>) + (9 x 10<sup><fontsize=-2>1</fontsize></sup>) + (2 x 10<sup><fontsize=-2>0</fontsize></sup>).

<p>   The pure binary system of positional notation uses two symbols as
digits -- 0 and 1, placed in a numerical sequence with values based on
consecutively ascending powers of 2.  In pure binary notation, what
would be the tens position is the twos position; what would be
hundreds position is the fours position; what would be the thousands
position is the eights.  Any decimal number from 0 to 10 can
be represented in the binary system with four digits or positions as
indicated in the following table.

<p>  
   The BCD system using decimal numerals replaces the character for
each component decimal digit in the decimal numeral with the
corresponding four-digit binary numeral, shown in the righthand column
of the table.  Thus decimal 53 is represented as 0101 0011 in BCD,
because decimal 5 is equal to binary 0101 and decimal 3 is equivalent
to binary 0011.  In pure binary notation, however, decimal 53 equals
binary 110101.  The conversion of BCD numerals to pure binary numerals
can be done mentally through use of the foregoing table.  The method
sought to be patented varies the ordinary arithmetic steps a human
would use by changing the order of the steps, changing the symbolism
for writing the multiplier used in some steps, and by taking subtotals
after each successive operation.  The mathematical procedures can be
carried out in existing computers long in use, no new machinery being
necessary.  And, as noted, they can also be performed without a
computer.

<p>
   The Court stated in <em>Mackay Co.</em> v. <em>Radio Corp.</em>, 306 U.S. 86, 94,
that ``[w]hile a scientific truth, or the mathematical expression of it,
is not a patentable invention, a novel and useful structure created
with the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be.'' That statement
followed the longstanding rule that ``[a]n idea of itself is not
patentable.'' <em>Rubber-Tip Pencil Co.</em> v. <em>Howard</em>, 20 Wall. 498, 507.
``A principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original
cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in
either of them an exclusive right.'' <em>Le Roy</em> v. <em>Tatham</em>, 14 How. 156,
175.  Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes,
and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the
basic tools of scientific and technological work.  As we stated in
<em>Funk Bros. Seed Co.</em> v. <em>Kalo Co.</em>, 333 U.S. 127, 130, ``He who discovers
a hitherto unknown phenomenon of nature has no claim to a monopoly of
it which the law recognizes.  If there is to be invention from such a
discovery, it must come from the application of the law of nature to a
new and useful end.'' We dealt there with a ``product'' claim, while the
present case deals with a ``process'' claim.  But we think the
same principle applies.

<p>

<p>   Here the ``process'' claim is so abstract and sweeping as to cover
both known and unknown uses of the BCD to pure binary conversion.  The
end use may (1) vary from the operation of a train to verification of
drivers' licenses to researching the law books for precedents and (2)
be performed through any existing machinery or future-devised
machinery or without any apparatus.

<p>   In <em>O'Reilly</em> v. <em>Morse</em>, 15 How. 62, Morse was allowed a patent for a
process of using electromagnetism to produce distinguishable signs for
telegraphy.  <em>Id</em>., at 111. But the Court denied the eighth claim in
which Morse claimed the use of ``electro magnetism, however developed
for marking or printing intelligible characters, signs, or letters, at
any distances.'' <em>Id</em>., at 112. The Court in disallowing that claim said,
``If this claim can be maintained, it matters not by what process or
machinery the result is accomplished.  For aught that we now know,
some future inventor, in the onward march of science, may discover a
mode of writing or printing at a distance by means of the electric or
galvanic current, without using any part of the process or combination
set forth in the plaintiff's specification.  His invention may be less
complicated -- less liable to get out of order -- less expensive in
construction, and in its operation.  But yet, if it is covered by this
patent, the inventor could not use it, nor the public have the benefit of
it, without the permission of this patentee.'' <em>Id</em>., at 113.

<p>   In <em>The Telephone Cases</em>, 126 U.S. 1, 534, the Court explained the
<em>Morse</em> case as follows: ``The effect of that decision was, therefore,
that the use of magnetism as a motive power, without regard to the
particular process with which it was connected in the patent, could
not be claimed, but that its use in that connection could.'' Bell's
invention was the use of electric current to transmit vocal or other
sounds.  The claim was not ``for the use of a current of electricity in
its natural state as it comes from the battery, but for putting a
continuous current in a closed circuit into a certain specified
condition suited to the transmission of vocal and other sounds, and
using it in that condition for that purpose.'' <em>Ibid</em>.  The claim, in
other words, was not ``one for the use of electricity distinct from the
particular process with which it is connected in his patent.'' <em>Id</em>., at
535.  The patent was for that use of electricity ``both for the magneto
and variable resistance <em>methods</em>.'' <em>Id</em>., at 538.  Bell's claim, in other
words, was not one for all telephonic use of electricity.

<p>   In <em>Corning</em> v. <em>Burden</em>, 15 How. 252, 267-268, the Court said, ``One may discover
a new and useful improvement in the process of tanning, dyeing, etc.,
irrespective of any particular form of machinery or mechanical device.'' The
examples given were the ``arts of tanning, dyeing, making waterproof cloth,
vulcanizing India rubber, smelting ores.'' <em>Id</em>., at 267. Those are instances,
however, where the use of chemical substances or physical acts, such as
temperature control, changes articles or materials.  The chemical process or the
physical acts which transform the raw material are, however, sufficiently
definite to confine the patent monopoly within rather definite bounds.

<p>   <em>Cochrane</em> v. <em>Deener</em>, 94 U.S. 780, involved a process for
manufacturing flour so as to improve its quality.  The process first
separated the superfine flour and then removed impurities from the
middlings by blasts of air, reground the middlings, and then combined
the product with the superfine.  <em>Id</em>., at 785. The claim was not
limited to any special arrangement of machinery. <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court
said,

<p><blockquote>
   ``That a process may be patentable, irrespective of the particular
form of the instrumentalities used, cannot be disputed.  If one of the
steps of a process be that a certain substance is to be reduced to a
powder, it may not be at all material what instrument or machinery is
used to effect that object, whether a hammer, a pestle and mortar, or
a mill.  Either may be pointed out; but if the patent is not confined
to that particular tool or machine, the use of the others would be an
infringement, the general process being the same.  A process is a mode
of treatment of certain materials to produce a given result.  It is an
act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be
transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.'' <em>Id</em>., at
787-788.
</blockquote>

<p>   Transformation and reduction of an article ``to a different state
or thing'' is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that
does not include particular machines.  So it is that a patent in the
process of ``manufacturing fat acids and glycerine from fatty bodies
by the action of water at a high temperature and pressure'' was
sustained in <em>Tilghman</em> v. <em>Proctor</em>, 102 U.S. 707,
721. The Court said, ``The chemical principle or scientific fact upon
which it is founded is, that the elements of neutral fat require to be
severally united with an atomic equivalent of water in order to
separate from each other and become free.  This chemical fact was not
discovered by Tilghman.  He only claims to have invented a particular
mode of bringing about the desired chemical union between the fatty
elements and water.'' <em>Id</em>., at 729.

<p>   <em>Expanded Metal Co.</em> v. <em>Bradford</em>, 214 U.S. 366, sustained a patent on a
``process'' for expanding metal.  A process ``involving mechanical operations, and
producing a new and useful result,'' <em>id</em>., at 385-386, was held to be a patentable
process, process patents not being limited to chemical action.

<p>   <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Snow</em>, 294 U.S. 1, and <em>Waxham</em> v.
<em>Smith</em>, 294 U.S. 20, involved a process for setting eggs in
staged incubation and applying mechanically circulated currents of air
to the eggs.  The Court, in sustaining the function performed (the
hatching of eggs) and the means or process by which that is done,
said:
   
<blockquote>
   ``By the use of materials in a particular manner he secured the
performance of the function by a means which had never occurred in
nature, and had not been anticipated by the prior art; this is a
patentable method or process. . . .  A method, which may be patented
irrespective of the particular form of the mechanism which may be
availed of for carrying it into operation, is not to be rejected as
`functional,' merely because the specifications show a machine capable
of using it.'' 294 U.S., at 22.  </blockquote>

<p>   It is argued that a process patent must either be tied to a
particular machine or apparatus or must operate to change articles or
materials to a ``different state or thing.'' We do not hold that no
process patent could ever qualify if it did not meet the requirements
of our prior precedents.  It is said that the decision precludes a
patent for any program servicing a computer.  We do not so hold.  It
is said that we have before us a program for a digital computer but
extend our holding to programs for analog computers.  We have,
however, made clear from the start that we deal with a program only
for digital computers.  It is said we freeze process patents to old
technologies, leaving no room for the revelations of the new,
onrushing technology.  Such is not our purpose.  What we come down to
in a nutshell is the following.

<p>   It is conceded that one may not patent an idea.  But in practical effect that
would be the result if the formula for converting BCD numerals to pure binary
numerals were patented in this case.  The mathematical formula involved here has
no substantial practical application except in connection with a digital
computer, which means that if the judgment below is affirmed, the
patent would wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect
would be a patent on the algorithm itself.

<p>   It may be that the patent laws should be extended to cover these
programs, a policy matter to which we are not competent to speak.  The
President's Commission on the Patent System<a name="F4"><a href="#FN4"><sup><fontsize=-2>4</font></sup></a></a> rejected the proposal that these
programs be patentable:<a name="F5"><a href="#FN5"><sup><fontsize=-2>5</font></sup></a></a>

<p><blockquote>
``Uncertainty now exists as to whether the statute permits a valid
patent to be granted on programs.  Direct attempts to patent programs
have been rejected on the ground of nonstatutory subject matter.
Indirect attempts to obtain patents and avoid the rejection, by
drafting claims as a process, or a machine or components thereof
programmed in a given manner, rather than as a program itself, have
confused the issue further and should not be permitted.

<p>   ``The Patent Office now cannot examine applications for programs because of a
lack of a classification technique and the requisite search files.  Even if
these were available, reliable searches would not be feasible or economic
because of the tremendous volume of prior art being generated.  Without this
search, the patenting of programs would be tantamount to mere registration and
the presumption of validity would be all but nonexistent.

<p>   ``It is noted that the creation of programs has undergone substantial and
satisfactory growth in the absence of patent protection and that copyright
protection for programs is presently available.''
</blockquote>
 
If these programs are to be patentable,<a name="F6"><a href="#FN6"><sup><fontsize=-2>6</font></sup></a></a> considerable problems are raised which only committees of
Congress can manage, for broad powers of investigation are needed,
including hearings which canvass the wide variety of views which those
operating in this field entertain.  The technological problems
tendered in the many briefs before us<a name="F7"><a href="#FN7"><sup><fontsize=-2>7</font></sup></a></a>
indicate to us that considered action by the Congress is needed.

<h1><strong>In re Benson</strong></h1>
United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals<br>
441 F.2d 682, 58 C.C.P.A. 1134<br>
1971
</center>

<p>Before Rich, Almond, Baldwin, Lane, Associate Judges, and Re,
Judge, sitting by Designation.

<p>   Rich, Judge, delivered the opinion of the court.

<p>   This appeal is from the January 31, 1968 decision of the Patent Office Board
of Appeals<a name="F1_1"><a href="#FN1_1"><sup><fontsize=-2>1</font></sup></a></a> affirming the rejection of claims 8 and 13, the only claims
remaining in appellants' application serial No. 315,050, filed October 9, 1963,
and assigned to Bell Telephone Laboratories Incorporated, entitled ``Conversion
of Numerical Information.'' We reverse.

<p><em>The Invention</em>

<p></center>

<p>   The invention of the appealed claims is in the field of computer technology
and relates to data processing systems.  The claims are both directed to
methods.  The opening sentence of the specification states that the invention
relates to the processing of data by program and more particularly to the
programed conversion of numerical information.  The particular conversion to
which both of the claims on appeal are directed is the conversion of ``binary
coded decimal'' (BCD) numerical information in the form of ``signals'' (claim 8) or
``representations'' (claim 13) into binary number signals or representations,
respectively.  Though we presume this statement would be an adequate explanation
to those skilled in the computer art, for the benefit of those not so skilled we
will elucidate further.

<p>        Most digital computers perform their computing operations on
information in binary form, a system of representation having only two
elementary constituents, called ``bits,'' indicated by ``1'' and ``0''.  Men, on the
other hand, are accustomed to quantitative information in decimal form and, for
the computer to work on or      utilize it, it must be converted into
binary form.  It has become a general practice to make this conversion in two
stages: from decimal to BCD; from BCD to binary.  The following table shows the
ten familiar decimal digits and their binary equivalents expressed in groups of
four bits:

</center>

<p>   In BCD notation the decimal number 53 would be represented as 0101 0011, the
binary form of 5 followed by the binary form of 3, each group of four bits being
a BCD ``digit.'' Although the BCD notation is in terms of ``1'' and ``0'' only and can
be represented in a binary machine, it is not in a form in which the machine can
utilize it to perform its computing operations.  In true binary the decimal
number 53 is represented by 110101.  The problem is to convert the intermediate
BCD representation into the true binary.  Various ways of doing this were known
prior to appellants' invention.  They claim to have discovered a better and
simpler way of doing it having various advantages recited in the specification
such as reducing the number of steps required to be taken, dispensing with the
repetitive storing and retrieval of partially converted information, eliminating
the need for interchanging signals among various equipment components and the
need for auxiliary equipment, and decreasing the chance of error.

<p>   The digital computer which is to receive the information in BCD form can
itself be programed to convert it into binary form.  The specification gives as
an illustrative example an actual program for converting a binary-coded decimal
number to ordinary binary and apparatus is described in conventional block
diagram form in which the program can be carried out.

<p>   The two claims on appeal read as follows:

<p><blockquote>
   8.  The method of converting signals from binary coded decimal form into
binary which comprises the steps of

<p>   (1) storing the binary coded decimal signals in a reentrant shift register,

<p>   (2) shifting the signals to the right by at least three places, until there
is a binary ``1'' in the second position of said register,

<p>   (3) masking out said binary ``1'' in said second position of said register,

<p>        (4) adding a binary ``1'' to the first position of said register,

<p>   (5) shifting the signals to the left by two positions,

<p>   (6) adding a ``1'' to said first position, and

<p>   (7) shifting the signals to the right by at least three positions in
preparation for a succeeding binary ``1'' in the second position of said register.

<p>
   13.  A data processing method for converting binary coded decimal number
representations into binary number representations comprising the steps of

<p></blockquote>

<p>   (1) testing each binary digit position i, beginning with the least
significant binary digit position, of the most significant decimal digit
representation for a binary ``0'' or a binary ``1'';

<p>   (2) if a binary ``0'' is detected, repeating step (1) for the next least
significant binary digit position of said most significant decimal digit
representation;

<p>   (3) if a binary ``1'' is detected, adding a binary ``1'' at the (i + 1)th and (i
+ 3)th least significant binary digit positions of the next lesser significant
decimal digit representation, and repeating step (1) for the next least
significant binary digit position of said most significant decimal digit
representation;

<p>   (4) upon exhausting the binary digit positions of said most significant
     decimal digit representation, repeating steps (1) through (3) for the
next lesser significant decimal digit representation as modified by the previous
execution of steps (1) through (3); and

<p>   (5) repeating steps (1) through (4) until the second least significant
decimal digit representation has been so processed.

   As to these claims, no prior art is cited and no question is raised as to
utility, novelty, or unobviousness.The asserted advantages and the implicit
advance resulting therefrom in the data-processing art have not been questioned.

<p><center>
   <em>The Rejection</em>
</center>

<p>   The first problem it is necessary to settle is what the ground or grounds of
rejection is or are.  Appellants' brief correctly states ``The only explicit
rejection outstanding against claims 8 and 13 is the rejection on the grounds
[<em>sic</em>] that these claims are directed to subject matter not embraced by Section
101.'' Study of the two Examiner's Answers makes it clear that that was the only
ground he relied on.  In his first Answer the examiner specified that ``all
grounds of rejection are withdrawn except the art rejections and nonstatutory
subject matter rejections.'' We no longer have any art rejections.  In his second
Answer, on remand, he said:

<p><blockquote>
   In summary, the remaining ground of rejection of claims 8 and 13 now in the
case is that these claims are directed to non-statutory subject matter.
</blockquote>

<p>   In reciting what the rejection was, the board opinion says:

<p><blockquote>
   Claims 8 and 13 stand rejected as for subject matter not embraced by 35
U.S.C. 101 in that they set forth ``mental processes'' and ``mathematical steps,''
neither being an ``art'' as construed by a long line of decisions * * *.
</blockquote>

<p>        Nowhere does the board opinion indicate that any new ground of
rejection is being made.

<p>   In discussing appellants' arguments traversing the contention that the claims
are directed to non-statutory subject matter, the board, answering the argument
that ``The only way applicants' claims can be construed to include mental steps
is to construe them contrary to the disclosure rather than in accord therewith,''
made the following somewhat off-the-point observations:

<p><blockquote>
   We are not convinced by appellants' arguments to the effect that the
disclosure in an application, not the claims thereof, should be the proper basis
for judging whether the claims are drawn to subject matter outside the statute.
Certainly a claim which embraces that which was already in the prior art or was
obvious therefrom could not be sustained under 35 U.S.C. 102 or 103 merely
because there may have been something patentable disclosed in the specification.
35 U.S.C. 112 [2d par., 1st sentence] <em>requires the claim to point out the
subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention so that a claim
which is so broad and indistinct as to embrace within its terms subject matter
that can not be patented under section 101 of the statute, similarly must be
unpatentable.</em> [Emphasis ours.]
</blockquote>

<p>   While from that point on in its opinion the board discussed the breadth of
the claims and what in its opinion they cover, it never so much as suggested
that the claims are ``indistinct'' or do not point out ``the subject matter which
the applicant regards as his invention.'' The board did not again refer to
section 112 nor in any way suggest failure of the claims to comply with the
second paragraph of that section and merely affirmed the rejection on the ground
that the claims, as it read them, were directed to methods which are
non-statutory under section 101.  It is our opinion that up until the time of
the appeal to this court there was only one ground of rejection relied on and
that was non-compliance with section 101.

<p>   However, apparently out of an abundance of caution and noting the board's
     reference to section 112 in the above-quoted passage, as well as a
similar passage in the Examiner's Answer on Remand,<a name="F1_2"><a href="#FN1_2"><sup><fontsize=-2>2</font></sup></a></a> appellants' main brief,
toward its end, says of the italicized passage in the above quotation from the
board's opinion that it could be construed as another example similar to the
sections 102 and 103      example preceding, <em>or it could also be
construed as an entirely new ground of rejection under section 112</em>,
simultaneously deploring the ``vagaries of prosecution [which] leave some of the
basic issues in doubt.'' Appellants thereupon spent a page of their brief stating
their reasons why a rejection under the second paragraph of section 112, <em>if</em> such
had been made, would be in error.  That would seem a cautious thing to do but it
does not bring such a rejection into the case unless it was already there.  
 
   The brief for the Patent Office trades heavily on this situation.  On page 2
it quotes appellants as saying that they ``have no alternative but to consider a
rejection under Section 112 as having been raised and requiring a response'' and
proceeds to the conclusion that ``A rejection under 35 USC 112, 2nd paragraph,
would thus also appear to [be] present,'' pointing out that a reason of appeal in
appellants' Notice of Appeal alleges that the board erred

<p>   * * * in sustaining the Examiner's rejection of claims 8 and 13 as failing to
point out the subject matter which appellants regard as their invention under 35
U.S.C. 112 in that the claims are so broad and indistinct as to embrace within
their terms subject matter that can not be patented under 35 U.S.C. 101.

<p>   This, it will be seen, is a close paraphrase of what the board said in the
paragraph quoted above.  It was an appropriate reason of appeal to file to cover
the contingency that what the board said might be a new ground of rejection.
The Patent Office brief goes on to argue, it would seem as its <em>principal</em>
contention,<a name="F1_3"><a href="#FN1_3"><sup><fontsize=-2>3</font></sup></a></a> not that the claims are directed to non-statutory subject matter
because directed to mental or mathematical steps, which do no constitute an
``art,''<a name="F1_4"><a href="#FN1_4"><sup><fontsize=-2>4</font></sup></a></a> <em>but</em> that ``the rejection under 35 USC 112 should be affirmed'' because
appellants admitted during prosecution that their process is capable of manual
implementation with the aid of pencil and paper, that this is ``beyond that which
they presently regard as their invention,'' and that the claims must be rejected
<em>under section 112</em> by reason of our decision in <em>In re Prater and Wei</em>, 56 CCPA
1381, 415 F.2d 1393, 162 USPQ 541 (1969). 
 
<center>
   Opinion
</center>     

<p>   We have decided a number of cases in the general field of computer science in
addition to the <em>Prater</em> case, <em>supra</em>, since the briefs in this case were filed
which we list here for convenient reference:
<blockquote>
        <em>In re Bernhart</em>, 57 CCPA 737, 417 F.2d 1395, 163 USPQ 611 (1969)<br>
   <em>In re Mahony</em>, 57 CCPA 939, 421 F.2d 742, 164 USPQ 572 (1970)<br>
   <em>In re Musgrave</em>, 57 CCPA 1352, 431 F.2d 882, 167 USPQ 280 (1970)<br>
   <em>In re Foster</em>, 58 CCPA 1001, 438 F.2d 1011, 169 USPQ 99 (1971)
</blockquote>

<p> This is an appropriate place to point out a significant difference
between most of those cases and the present case.  The claims in this
case are directed solely to the art of data-processing itself whereas
in most of the above cases some subsidiary or additional art was
involved.  In <em>Bernhart</em> it was ``Planar Illustration Method
and Apparatus'' by which two-dimensional illustrations of
three-dimensional objects could be produced; in <em>Mahony</em> we
were concerned with dataprocessing itself in that the invention was a
method of locating the framing bits in a bit stream; in both
<em>Musgrave</em> and <em>Foster</em> computers were used to process
seismograms; and in <em>Prater</em> the invention related to the
spectrographic analysis of gases.  All of the above cases and the
present case have in common, however, the fact that they are the
outgrowth of a blanket Patent Office policy, which remained in
existence for some time after the decision of the board in this case,
to deny claims such as those before us here on the ground that they
were not for statutory subject matter.<a name="F1_5"><a
href="#FN1_5"><sup><fontsize=-2>5</font></sup></a></a> This policy was
later modified.<a name="F1_6"><a
href="#FN1_6"><sup><fontsize=-2>6</font></sup></a></a> The decision
here for review is a typical product of its time.

<p>   Reverting now to the first problem which confronts us, what rejection do we
have before us for decision?  We conclude, appellants' apprehension
notwithstanding, that the examiner and the board relied on only one ground,
predicated on 35 USC 101, that claims 8 and 13 are either directed to or at
least embrace non-statutory subject matter.  Neither of them complained that the
claims are unclear, ambiguous, indistinct, or otherwise incomprehensible so as
not to comply with section 112, second paragraph.  In <em>Mahony</em> we made it clear
that ``To inject any question of statutory subject matter into that paragraph is
to depart from its wording and to complicate the law unnecessarily.'' The
solicitor's attempt to build up a rejection on section 112 in order to defeat
appellants under the second <em>Prater</em> case decision--a decision not rendered until
five months after appellants      filed their main brief in this court--must fail. It would have to fail in any case for, as appellants point out in
their reply brief, in <em>Prater</em> appellants admitted in the course of the appeal
that their claims read on a mental step implementation and we based our decision
on that admission insofar as we affirmed the rejection, whereas here appellants
have made no such admission and, for reasons hereinafter stated, we do not think
the claims read on any ``mental step'' implementation.

<p>   We turn then to consideration of what the solicitor's brief admits is the
``principal rejection'' predicated on section 101, which we find to be the only
rejection.

<center>
   <em>Claim 8</em>
</center>

<p> We have set forth claim 8 above and have stated that the examiner and
board rejected it because they considered it to be directed to ``mental
processes'' and ``mathematical steps.'' The reasoning of the board's opinion bears
a remarkable      similarity to the opinion of the board in <em>Musgrave</em>,
which is not surprising since it was the same board and the opinion was by the
same member.  The same line of cases is relied on here that was relied on in
<em>Prater</em> and <em>Musgrave</em> and we have given them full consideration before,
particularly in those two cases in which we considered at length the ``mental
steps'' doctrine.  One of the many sound ideas expressed in the concurring
opinion delivered by Judge Baldwin in <em>Musgrave</em> is ``that in reality very little
remains [as a result of our recent decisions] of the `mental steps' doctrine.''
Another is that as a result of <em>Prater</em> and <em>Mahony</em>--If, indeed, it has not always
been so<a name="F1_7"><a href="#FN1_7"><sup><fontsize=-2>7</font></sup></a></a>--there  is a ``standard of reasonableness'' in the interpretation
of claims which is that they should be given the meaning they would have ``to one
of ordinary skill in the pertinent art when read in light of and consistently
with the specification.'' The question Judge Baldwin asked in <em>Musgrave</em> is the
question we have here: ``* * * would a <em>reasonable</em> interpretation of the claims
include coverage of the process implemented by the human mind?'' The answer
clearly is ``No,'' for the same reasons it had to be ``No'' in <em>Mahony</em> and in
<em>Musgrave</em>. Claim 8 is for a method to be practiced in part on particular
<em>apparatus</em> specified to be a ``reentrant shift register.'' The first sentence of a
three-paragraph definition of ``shift register'' in the ``Condensed Computer
Encyclopedia'' edited by Jordain, McGraw-Hill Book Co. (1969), is: ``A hardware
element constructed so as to perform the      shifting of its contained
data.'' At argument, the Patent Office Solicitor admitted that the reference to
this piece of apparatus in the claim was, for him, its ``most embarrassing
phrase.'' It is not only a phrase, it is referred to expressly in elements (1),
(2), (3), (4) and (7) and by implication in element (5) which refers to
``shifting.'' Claim 8, moreover, refers to the operations of storing, shifting,
and masking ``signals'' which, by a <em>reasonable</em> interpretation in the light of the
specification, can only mean signals of the kind upon which the disclosed
electronic digital computer hardware operates.  The signals are like the ``bits''
and ``bit streams'' with which we were concerned in <em>Mahony</em>. Claim 8 therefore
covers only a machine-implemented process and the apparatus for carrying it out
has been disclosed.  The process can be carried out with no intervention by a
human being once the apparatus is set up--that is to say, the appropriate
computer system has been assembled and programmed.  The solicitor would have us
hold  the method is not a ``process'' within section 101 on the ground that a
programmable computer is merely a ``tool of the mind'' and the method is basically
``mental'' in character, apparently because the ``workstuff'' of the method is
numbers which are mathematical abstractions.  As the Patent Office would say, we
do not find the argument persuasive.  Cash registers, bookkeeping machines, and
adding machines also work only with numbers but this has never been considered a
ground for taking them out of the ``machine'' category of section 101.  
 
<center>
   <em>Claim 13</em>
</center>

<p>   This claim was rejected on the same ground as claim 8 from which it
differs in containing no reference to any apparatus and in referring
to the thing operated upon not as ``signals'' but as
``representations.'' The claimed method is one for converting ``binary
coded decimal number representations'' into ``binary number
representations.'' The supporting disclosure against which the claim
must be reasonably interpreted is the identical programmed digital
computer system which supports claim 8.  The operational steps to be
carried out call for ``testing each binary digit position'' to
determine whether it is a ``binary `0''' or a ``binary `1''' and
performing a specified act according to what is found, i.e., moving to
the next position if it is ``0'' and repeating the test or adding a
binary ``1'' at two specified positions and then moving to the next
position, and so on, each action being prescribed so that no human
judgment or decision is required--merely observation and taking
prescribed action according to what is observed.  Apparatus,
machinery, ``hardware''--whatever it may be called--is disclosed by
which the steps can be carried out without human intervention but at
the same time, since the claim does not itself call for any particular
hardware, the method within the claim can be practiced either with
apparatus other than that described or with the simplest of equipment
which will enable one to provide and to manipulate ``binary coded
decimal representations'' and convert them into ``binary number
representations.'' This could <em>in theory</em> be any kind of writing
implement and any kind of recording medium--``pencil and paper''--or
even, we suppose, red and blue poker chips and a surface to put them
on or slots to put them in so that ``0''s and ``1''s can be
represented.

<p>   It will aid in understanding the terms of claim 13 to state that the
discovery which is the essence of appellants' invention was that, for each bit
position in each BCD digit, conversion can be accomplished by adding a binary
``1'' to two specific bit positions of the next lesser significant BCD digit and
that in normal notation ``significance'' of bits or digits increases to the left,
e.g., in the decimal number ``53'' the 5 is more significant than the 3.  Thus
conversion can be carried out by the steps of (1) testing each BCD bit position
for all but the least significant BCD digit and (2) for each ``1'' bit detected,
adding a binary ``1'' to each of two specified bit positions in the next lesser
significant BCD digit.
    The only argument put forward by the Patent Office for holding claim 13
non-statutory under section 101 is that the method is basically ``mental'' in
character.  Looking at the present case in the light of all its circumstances,
we observe in claim 13 a process consisting of a sequence of steps which can be
carried out by machine implementation as disclosed in the specification, by
still another machine as disclosed during the prosecution, and even manually
although in actual practice it seems improbable anyone would ever do that, speed
measured in milli- or even micro-seconds being essential in the practical
utilization of such a process.  Only in the manual performance would it require
the operator even to think and then only to the extent necessary to assure that
he is doing what the claim tells him to do.  In no case is the exercise of
judgment required or even the making of a decision as between alternatives.

<p>   Realistically, the process of claim 13 has no practical use other than the
more effective operation and utilization of a <em>machine</em> known as a digital
computer.  It seems beyond question that the machines--the computers--are in
the technological field, are a part of one of our best-known technologies, and
are in the ``useful arts'' rather than the ``liberal arts,'' as are all other types
of ``business machines,'' regardless of the uses to which their users may put
them.  How can it be said that a process having no practical value other than
enhancing      the internal operation of those machines is not likewise
in the technological or useful arts?  We conclude that the Patent Office has put
forth no sound reason why the claims in this case should be held to be
non-statutory.

<p>   The decision of the board is reversed.

section, the examiner said:

   ``The method set forth is by applicants' own assertion `directed to a machine

<p>   That paragraph by the examiner therefore begins and ends with the summary
statement of his position that the single ground of rejection is that the claims
are directed to non-statutory subject matter under 35 USC 101. In short, a

   Apple Computer, Inc. appeals from the district court's denial of a motion to
preliminarily enjoin Franklin Computer Corp. from infringing the copyrights 
Apple holds on fourteen computer programs. 
 
   The decision to grant or refuse to grant a preliminary injunction
is within the discretion of the district court.  <em>See A.O. Smith
Corp</em>. v. <em>FTC</em>, 530 F.2d 515, 525 (3d Cir. 1976). Although the
scope of our review of the action of the district court in ruling on a
motion for preliminary injunction is narrow, reversal is warranted if
the trial court has abused its discretion or committed error in
applying the law.  <em>Kennecott Corp</em>. v. <em>Smith</em>, 637 F.2d
181, 187 (3d Cir.  1980). As the Second Circuit has stated recently,
``Despite oft repeated statements that the issuance of a preliminary
injunction rests in the discretion of the trial judge whose decisions
will be reversed only for `abuse', a court of appeals must reverse if
the district court has proceeded on the basis of an erroneous view of
the applicable law.'' <em>Donovan</em> v. <em>Bierwirth</em>, 680 F.2d 263,
269 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 459 U.S. 1069, 103 S. Ct. 488, 74
L. Ed. 2d 631 (1982).
 
   In this case the district court denied the preliminary injunction,
<em>inter alia</em>, because it had ``some doubt as to the
copyrightability of the programs.''  <em>Apple Computer, Inc</em>. v.
<em>Franklin Computer Corp</em>., 545 F. Supp. 812, 812 (E.D. Pa.
1982). This legal ruling is fundamental to all future proceedings in
this action and, as the parties and amici curiae seem to agree, has
considerable significance to the computer services
industry.<a name="F1"><a href="#FN1"><sup><fontsize=-2>1</font></sup></a></a>
Because we conclude that the district court proceeded under an erroneous
view of the applicable law, we reverse the denial of the preliminary
injunction and remand.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
</center>
 
<p>
   Apple, one of the computer industry leaders, manufactures and markets 
personal computers (microcomputers), related peripheral equipment such as disk 
drives (peripherals), and computer programs (software).  It presently 
manufactures Apple II computers and distributes over 150 programs.  Apple has 
sold over 400,000 Apple II computers, employs approximately 3,000 people, and 
had annual sales of $335,000,000 for fiscal year 1981.  One of the by-products 
of Apple's success is the independent development by third parties of numerous 
computer programs which are designed to run on the Apple II computer. 
    
 
   Franklin, the defendant below, manufactures and sells the ACE 100 personal 
computer and at the time of the hearing employed about 75 people and had sold 
fewer than 1,000 computers.  The ACE 100 was designed to be ``Apple compatible,'' 
so that peripheral equipment and software developed for use with the Apple II 
computer could be used in conjunction with the ACE 100.  Franklin's copying of 
Apple's operating system computer programs in an effort to achieve such 
compatibility precipitated this suit. 
 
   Like all computers both the Apple II and ACE 100 have a central processing 
unit (CPU) which is the integrated circuit that executes programs.  In lay terms, 
the CPU does the work it is instructed to do.  Those instructions are contained 
on computer programs. 
 
   There are three levels of computer language in which computer programs may be 
written.<a name="F2"><a href="#FN2"><sup><fontsize=-2>2</font></sup></a></a> High level language, such as the commonly used BASIC or FORTRAN, 
uses English words and symbols, and is relatively easy to learn and understand 
(e.g., ``GO TO 40'' tells the computer to skip intervening steps and go to the 
step at line 40).  A somewhat lower level language is assembly language, which 
consists of alphanumeric labels (e.g., ``ADC'' means ``add with carry''). 
Statements in high level language, and apparently also statements in assembly 
language, are referred to as written in ``source code.'' The third, or lowest 
level computer language, is machine language, a binary language using two 
symbols, 0 and 1, to indicate an open or closed switch (e.g., ``01101001'' means, 
to the Apple, add two numbers and save the result).  Statements in machine 
language are referred to as written in ``object code.''  
 
    
 
   The CPU can only follow instructions written in object code.  However, 
programs are usually written in source code which is more intelligible to 
humans.  Programs written in source code can be converted or translated by a 
``compiler'' program into object code for use by the computer.  Programs are 
generally distributed only in their object code version stored on a memory 
device. 
 
   A computer program can be stored or fixed on a variety of memory devices, two 
of which are of particular relevance for this case.  The ROM (Read Only Memory) 
is an internal permanent memory device consisting of a semi-conductor ``chip'' 
which is incorporated into the circuitry of the computer.  A program in object 
code is embedded on a ROM before it is incorporated in the computer. 
Information stored on a ROM can only be read, not erased or rewritten.<a name="F3"><a href="#FN3"><sup><fontsize=-2>3</font></sup></a></a> The 
ACE 100 apparently contains EPROMS (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) on 
which the stored information can be erased and the chip reprogrammed, but the 
district court found that for purposes of this proceeding, the difference 
between ROMs and EPROMs is inconsequential.  545 F. Supp. at 813 n.3. The other 
device used for storing the programs at issue is a diskette or ``floppy disk'', an 
auxiliary memory device consisting of a flexible magnetic disk resembling a 
phonograph record, which can be inserted into the computer and from which data 
or instructions can be read. 
 
    
 
   Computer programs can be categorized by function as either application 
programs or operating system programs.  Application programs usually perform a 
specific task for the computer user, such as word processing, checkbook 
balancing, or playing a game.  In contrast, operating system programs generally 
manage the internal functions of the computer or facilitate use of application 
programs.  The parties agree that the fourteen computer programs at      
issue in this suit are operating system programs.<a name="F4"><a href="#FN4"><sup><fontsize=-2>4</font></sup></a></a> 
 
   Apple filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District 
of Pennsylvania pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1338 on May 12, 1982, alleging that 
Franklin was liable for copyright infringement of the fourteen computer 
programs, patent infringement, unfair competition, and misappropriation. 
Franklin's answer in respect to the copyright counts included the affirmative 
defense that the programs contained no copyrightable subject matter.  Franklin 
counterclaimed for declaratory judgment that the copyright registrations were 
invalid and unenforceable, and sought affirmative relief on the basis of Apple's 
alleged misuse.  Franklin also moved to dismiss eleven of the fourteen copyright 
infringement counts on the ground that Apple failed to comply with the 
procedural requirements for suit under 17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 410, 411.      
 
   After expedited discovery, Apple moved for a preliminary injunction
to restrain Franklin from using, copying, selling, or infringing
Apple's copyrights.  The district court held a three day evidentiary
hearing limited to the copyright infringement claims.  Apple produced
evidence at the hearing in the form of affidavits and testimony that
programs sold by Franklin in conjunction with its ACE 100 computer
were virtually identical with those covered by the fourteen Apple
copyrights.  The variations that did exist were minor, consisting
merely of such things as deletion of reference to Apple or its
copyright notice.<a name="F5"><a href="#FN5"><sup><fontsize=-2>5</font></sup></a></a> James Huston, an Apple systems
programmer, concluded that the Franklin programs were ``unquestionably
copied from Apple and could not have been independently created.'' He
reached this conclusion not only because it is ``almost impossible for
so many lines of code'' to be identically written, but also because his
name, which he had embedded in one program (Master Create), and the
word ``Applesoft'', which was embedded in another (DOS 3.3), appeared
on the Franklin master disk.  Apple estimated the ``works in suit''
took 46 man-months to produce at a cost of over $740,000, not
including the time or cost of creating or acquiring earlier versions
of the programs or the expense of marketing the programs.

<p>   Franklin did not dispute that it copied the Apple programs.  Its witness 
admitted copying each of the works in suit from the Apple programs.  Its factual 
defense was directed to its contention that it was not feasible for Franklin to 
write its own operating system programs.  David McWherter, now Franklin's 
vice-president of engineering, testified he spent 30-40 hours in November 1981 
making a study to determine if it was feasible for Franklin to write its own 
Autostart ROM program and concluded it was not because ``there were just too many 
entry points in relationship to the number of instructions in the program.'' 
Entry points at specific locations in the program can be used by programmers to 
mesh their application programs with the operating system program.  McWherter 
concluded that use of the identical signals was necessary in order to ensure 
100% compatibility with application programs created to run on the Apple 
computer.  He admitted that he never attempted to rewrite Autostart ROM and 
conceded that some of the works in suit (<em>i.e.</em>  Copy, Copy A, Master Create, and 
Hello) probably could have been rewritten by Franklin.  Franklin made no attempt 
to rewrite any of the programs prior to the lawsuit except for Copy, although 
McWherter testified that Franklin was ``in the process of redesigning'' some of 
the Apple programs and that ``[w]e had a fair degree of certainty that that would 
probably work.'' Apple introduced evidence that Franklin could have rewritten 
programs, including the Autostart ROM program, and that there are in existence 
operating programs written by third parties which are compatible with Apple II. 
 
   Franklin's principal defense at the preliminary injunction hearing and before 
us is primarily a legal one, directed to its contention that the Apple operating 
system programs are not capable of copyright protection. 
 
   The district court denied the motion for preliminary injunction by order and
opinion dated July 30, 1982.  Apple moved for reconsideration in light of this 
court's decision in <em>Williams Electronics, Inc</em>. v. <em>Artic International, Inc</em>., 685 
F.2d 870 (3d Cir. 1982), which was decided August 2, 1982, three days after the 
district court decision.  The district court denied the motion for 
reconsideration.  We have jurisdiction of Apple's appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 
&#167; 1292(a)(1).

<p>
III. 
<p> 
THE DISTRICT COURT OPINION
</center> 
 
<p>
   In its opinion, the district court referred to the four factors to be 
considered on request for a preliminary injunction: a reasonable 
probability of success on the merits; irreparable injury; the improbability of 
harm to other interested persons; and the public interest.  545 F. Supp. at 825; 
see <em>Delaware River Port Authority</em> v. <em>Transamerican Trailer Transport, Inc</em>., 501 
F.2d 917, 919--20 (3d Cir. 1974). The court stated it based its denial of the 
motion on the first two factors.  The court held Apple had not made the 
requisite showing of likelihood of success on the merits because it ``concluded 
that there is some doubt as to the copyrightability of the programs described in 
this litigation.'' 545 F. Supp. at 812. It also stated that ``Apple is better 
suited to withstand whatever injury it might sustain during litigation than is 
Franklin to withstand the effects of a preliminary injunction'' because an 
injunction would have a ``devastating effect'' on Franklin's business, <em>id</em>. at 825, 
apparently concluding on that basis that Apple had failed to show irreparable 
harm. 
 
   It is difficult to discern precisely why the district court questioned the 
copyrightability of the programs at issue since there is no finding, statement, 
or holding on which we can focus which clearly sets forth the district court's 
view.  Throughout the opinion the district court referred to the ``complexity of 
the question presented by the present case'', 545 F. Supp. at 824, and the 
``baffling'' problem at issue.  <em>Id</em>. at 822. 
 
   The opinion expresses a series of generalized concerns which may have led the 
court to its ultimate conclusion, and which the parties and amici treat as 
holdings.  The district court referred to the requirement under the Copyright 
Act of finding ``original works of authorship'', 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a), and seems to 
have found that there was a sufficient ``modicum of creativity'' to satisfy the 
statutory requirement of an ``original work''.  545 F. Supp. at 820--21. The court 
was less clear as to whether the creation of a computer program by a programmer 
satisfied the requirement of ``works of authorship'', <em>id</em>., and whether an 
operating system program in ``binary code or one represented either in a ROM or 
by micro-switches'' was an ``expression'' which could be copyrighted as 
distinguished from an ``idea'' which could not be.  <em>Id</em>. at 821. 
 
   Again, although we cannot point to a specific holding, running throughout the 
district court opinion is the suggestion that programs in object code and ROMs 
may not be copyrightable.  Thus, for example, in a series of discursive 
footnotes, the district court stated that it found ``persuasive'' a district court 
opinion ``holding that object code in ROM is not copyright protected'', 545 F. 
Supp. at 818 n.8 (referring to <em>Data Cash Systems, Inc</em>. v. <em>JS&A Group, Inc.</em>, 480 
F. Supp. 1063 (N.D.Ill. 1979), <em>aff'd on other grounds</em>, 628 F.2d 1038 (7th Cir. 
1980)); described an opinion reaching a contrary conclusion as containing 
``rather terse analysis [which] provides little guidance'', 545 F. Supp. at 818 
n.8 (referring to <em>GCA Corp</em>. v. <em>Chance</em>, 217 U.S.P.Q. 718 (N.D.Cal. 1982), which 
followed the reasoning of <em>Tandy Corp</em>. v. <em>Personal Micro Computers, Inc</em>., 524 F. 
Supp. 171 (N.D.Cal. 1981)); and stated that ``Congressional intent regarding the 
copyrightability of object codes and ROMs is not clear'', 545 F. Supp. at 819 
n.9, and that even among members of the industry it was not clear that the 
copyright law protects works ``like those in suit that are ROM-based,'' <em>id</em>. at 819 
n.10. 
 
   We read the district court opinion as presenting the following legal issues:
(1) whether copyright can exist in a computer program expressed in object code,
(2) whether copyright can exist in a computer program embedded on a ROM, (3) 
whether copyright can exist in an operating system program, and (4) whether 
independent irreparable harm must be shown for a preliminary injunction in 
copyright infringement actions.

IV.

<p> 
DISCUSSION 

<p>A.
 <p>
<em>Copyrightability of a Computer Program</em><br>
<em>Expressed in Object Code</em> 
</center>
 
<p>
   Certain statements by the district court suggest that programs expressed in 
object code, as distinguished from source code, may not be the 
proper subject of copyright.  We find no basis in the statute for any such 
concern.  Furthermore, our decision in <em>Williams Electronics, Inc</em>. v. <em>Artic 
International, Inc., supra</em>, laid to rest many of the doubts expressed by the 
district court. 
 
   In 1976, after considerable study, Congress enacted a new copyright law to 
replace that which had governed since 1909.  Act of October 19, 1976, Pub. L. No. 
94--553, 90 Stat. 2541 (<em>codified</em> at 17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 101 <em>et seq</em>.).  Under the law, 
two primary requirements must be satisfied in order for a work to constitute 
copyrightable subject matter---it must be an ``original wor[k] of authorship'' 
and must be ``fixed in [a] tangible medium of expression.'' 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a). 
The statute provides:

<p><blockquote>  
   (a) Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original 
works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or 
later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise 
communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.
</blockquote>
 
   <em>Id</em>.  The statute enumerates seven categories under ``works of authorship'' 
including ``literary works'', defined as follows:

<p><blockquote> 
   ``Literary works'' are works, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, 
numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the 
nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts, 
phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied.
</blockquote> 
 
   17 U.S.C. &#167; 101.A work is ``fixed'' in a tangible medium of expression when: 
 
<blockquote>
   its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority of the 
author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, 
reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory 
duration.  A work consisting of sounds, images, or both, that are being 
transmitted, is ``fixed'' for purposes of this title if a fixation of the work is
being made simultaneously with its transmission.
</blockquote> 
 
   <em>Id</em>. 
 
   Although section 102(a) does not expressly list computer programs
as works of authorship, the legislative history suggests that programs
were considered copyrightable as literary works.  <em>See</em>
H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 54, <em>reprinted in</em> 1976
U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 5659, 5667 (``literary works' ...
includes ... computer programs'').  Because a Commission on New
Technological Uses (``CONTU'') had been created by Congress to study,
<em>inter alia</em>, computer uses of copyrighted works, Pub. L. No.
93--573, &#167; 201, 88 Stat. 1873 (1974), Congress enacted a status quo
provision, section 117, in the 1976 Act concerning such computer uses
pending the CONTU report and recommendations.<a name="F6"><a href="#FN6"><sup><fontsize=-2>6</font></sup></a></a>

<p>   The CONTU Final Report recommended that the copyright law be amended, <em>inter 
alia</em>, ``to make it explicit that computer programs, to the extent that they 
embody an author's original creation, are proper subject matter of copyright.'' 
National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works, <em>Final Report</em> 
1 (1979) [hereinafter CONTU Report].  CONTU recommended two changes relevant 
here: that section 117, the status quo provision, be repealed and replaced with 
a section limiting exclusive rights in computer programs so as ``to ensure that 
rightful possessors of copies of computer programs may use or adapt these copies 
for their use,'' <em>id</em>.; and that a definition of computer program be added to 
section 101.  <em>Id</em>. at 12.  Congress adopted both changes.  Act of Dec. 12, 1980, 
Pub. L. No. 96--517, &#167; 10, 94 Stat. 3015, 3028.  The revisions embodied CONTU's 
recommendations to clarify the law of copyright of computer software. 
H.R. Rep. No. 1307, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 23, <em>reprinted in</em> 1980 U.S. Code Cong. & 
Ad. News 6460, 6482. 
 
   The 1980 amendments added a definition of a computer program:
   
<blockquote> 
   A ``computer program'' is a set of statements or instructions to be used 
directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result. 
</blockquote> 

<p>   17 U.S.C.  &#167; 101. The amendments also substituted a new section 117 which 
provides that ``it is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer 
program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that 
computer program'' when necessary to ``the utilization of the computer program'' or 
``for archival purposes only.'' 17 U.S.C.  &#167; 117. The parties agree that this 
section is not implicated in the instant lawsuit.  The language of the 
provision, however, by carving out an exception to the normal proscriptions 
against copying, clearly indicates that programs are copyrightable and are 
otherwise afforded copyright protection. 
 
   We considered the issue of copyright protection for a computer program in 
<em>Williams Electronics, Inc</em>. v. <em>Artic International, Inc</em>., and concluded that ``the 
copyrightability of computer programs is firmly established after the 1980 
amendment to the Copyright Act.'' 685 F.2d at 875. At issue in <em>Williams</em> were not 
only two audiovisual copyrights to the ``attract'' and ``play'' modes of a video 
game, but also the computer program which was expressed in object code embodied 
in ROM and which controlled the sights and sounds of the game.  Defendant there 
had argued ``that when the issue is the copyright on a computer program, a 
distinction must be drawn between the `source code' version of a computer 
program, which ...  can be afforded copyright protection, and the ``object code'' 
stage, which ... cannot be so protected,'' an argument we rejected.  <em>Id</em>. at 
876. 
 
   The district court here questioned whether copyright was to be
limited to works ``designed to be ``read'' by a human reader [as
distinguished from] read by an expert with a microscope and
patience'', 545 F. Supp. at 821. The suggestion that copyrightability
depends on a communicative function to individuals stems from the
early decision of <em>White-Smith Music Publishing Co</em>. v.
<em>Apollo Co</em>., 209 U.S. 1, 52 L. Ed. 655, 28 S. Ct. 319 (1908),
which held a piano roll was not a copy of the musical composition
because it was not in a form others, except perhaps for a very expert
few, could perceive.  <em>See</em> 1 <em>Nimmer on Copyright</em>
&#167; 2.03[B][1] (1983).  However, it is clear from the language of the
1976 Act and its legislative history that it was intended to
obliterate distinctions engendered by <em>White-Smith</em>.
H.R. Rep. No. 1476, <em>supra</em>, at 52, <em>reprinted in</em> 1976
U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News at 5665.
 
   Under the statute, copyright extends to works in any tangible means of 
expression ``<em>from which they can be perceived</em>, reproduced, or otherwise 
communicated, either directly or <em>with the aid of a machine or device</em>.'' 17 
U.S.C.  &#167; 102(a) (emphasis added).  Further, the definition of ``computer 
program'' adopted by Congress in the 1980 amendments is ``sets of statements or 
instructions to be used <em>directly or indirectly</em> in a computer in order to bring 
about a certain result.'' 17 U.S.C.  &#167; 101 (emphasis added).  As source code 
instructions must be translated into object code before the computer can act 
upon them, only instructions expressed in object code can be used ``directly'' by 
the computer.  <em>See Midway Manufacturing Co</em>. v. <em>Strohon</em>, 564 F. Supp. 741, 750 
(N.D.Ill. 1983). This definition was adopted following the CONTU Report in which 
the majority clearly took the position that object codes are proper subjects of 
copyright.  <em>See</em> CONTU Report at 21.  The majority's conclusion was reached 
although confronted by a dissent based upon the theory that the ``machine-control 
phase'' of a program is not directed at a human audience.  <em>See</em> CONTU Report at 
28--30 (dissent of Commissioner Hersey). 
 
   The defendant in <em>Williams</em> had also argued that a copyrightable work ``must be 
intelligible to human beings and must be intended as a medium of communication 
to human beings,'' <em>id</em>. at 876--77.  We reiterate the statement we made in <em>Williams</em> 
when we rejected that argument: ``[t]he answer to defendant's contention is in 
the words of the statute itself.'' 685 F.2d at 877.     
   The district court also expressed uncertainty as to whether a computer 
program in object code could be classified as a ``literary work.''<a name="F7"><a href="#FN7"><sup><fontsize=-2>7</font></sup></a></a> However, the 
category of ``literary works'', one of the seven copyrightable categories, is not 
confined to literature in the nature of Hemingway's <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>. 
The definition of ``literary works'' in section 101 includes expression not only 
in words but also ``numbers, or other . . . numerical symbols or indicia'', 
thereby expanding the common usage of ``literary works.'' <em>Cf. Harcourt, Brace & 
World, Inc</em>. v. <em>Graphic Controls Corp.</em>, 329 F. Supp. 517, 523--24 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) 
(the symbols designating questions or response spaces on exam answer sheets held 
to be copyrightable ``writings'' under 1909 Act); <em>Reiss</em> v. <em>National Quotation 
Bureau, Inc</em>., 276 F. 717 (S.D.N.Y. 1921) (code book of coined words designed for 
cable use copyrightable).  Thus a computer program, whether in object code or 
source code, is a ``literary work'' and is protected from unauthorized copying, 
whether from its object or source code version.  <em>Accord Midway Mfg. Co</em>. v. 
<em>Strohon</em>, slip op. at 25--27; <em>see also GCA Corp</em>. v. <em>Chance</em>, 217 U.S.P.A. at 
719--20.

<p>B. 

<p><em>Copyrightability of a Computer Program</em> 
<em>Embedded on a ROM</em> 
</center>
 
<p>
   Just as the district court's suggestion of a distinction between source code
and object code was rejected by our opinion in <em>Williams</em> issued three days after
the district court opinion, so also was its suggestion that embodiment of a 
computer program on a ROM, as distinguished from in a traditional writing, 
detracts from its copyrightability.  In <em>Williams</em> we rejected the argument that 
``a computer program is not infringed when the program is loaded into electronic
memory devices (ROMs) and used to control the activity of machines.'' 685 F.2d at 
876. Defendant there had argued that there can be no copyright protection for 
the ROMs because they are utilitarian objects or machine parts.  We held that 
the statutory requirement of ``fixation'', the manner in which the issue arises, 
is satisfied through the embodiment of the expression in the ROM
devices.  <em>Id</em>.  
at 874, 876; <em>see also Midway Mfg. Co</em>. v. <em>Strohon</em>, slip op. at 27--30; <em>Tandy Corp</em>. 
v. <em>Personal Micro Computers, Inc</em>., 524 F. Supp. at 173; <em>cf. Stern Electronics, 
Inc</em>. v. <em>Kaufman</em>, 669 F.2d 852, 855--56 (2d Cir. 1982) (audiovisual display of 
video game ``fixed'' in ROM).  Therefore we reaffirm that a computer program in 
object code embedded in a ROM chip is an appropriate subject of copyright. 
 <em>See also Note, Copyright Protection of Computer Program Object Code</em>, 96
 Harv. L.Rev. 1723 (1983); <em>Note, Copyright Protection for Computer 
Programs in Read Only Memory Chips</em>, 11 Hofstra L.Rev. 329 (1982). 

<p><center> 
C.

<p><em>Copyrightability of Computer Operating</em>
<em>System Programs</em>
</center> 
 
<p>
   We turn to the heart of Franklin's position on appeal which is that
computer operating system programs, as distinguished from application
programs, are not the proper subject of copyright ``regardless of the
language or medium in which they are fixed.'' Brief of Appellee at 15
(emphasis deleted).  Apple suggests that this issue too is foreclosed by
our <em>Williams</em> decision because some portion of the program at
issue there was in effect an operating system program.  Franklin is
correct that this was not an issue raised by the parties in
<em>Williams</em> and it was not considered by the court.  Thus we
consider it as a matter of first impression.
 
   Franklin contends that operating system programs are <em>per se</em> excluded from 
copyright protection under the express terms of section 102(b) of the Copyright 
Act, and under the precedent and underlying principles of <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>, 101 
U.S. 99, 25 L. Ed. 841 (1879). These separate grounds have substantial analytic
overlap. 
 
   In <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>, plaintiff's testator held a copyright on a book 
explaining a bookkeeping system which included blank forms with ruled lines and 
headings designed for use with that system.  Plaintiff sued for copyright 
infringement on the basis of defendant's publication of a book containing a 
different arrangement of the columns and different headings, but which used a 
similar plan so far as results were concerned.  The Court, in reversing the 
decree for the plaintiff, concluded that blank account-books were not the 
subject of copyright and that ``the mere copyright of Selden's book did not 
confer upon him the exclusive right to make and use account-books, ruled and 
arranged as designated by him and described and illustrated in said book.''
 <em>Id</em>. at 107. The Court stated that copyright of the books did not give 
the plaintiff the exclusive right to use the system explained in the books, 
noting, for example, that ``copyright of a work on mathematical science cannot 
give to the author an exclusive right to the methods of operation which he 
propounds.'' <em>Id</em>. at 103. 
 
   Franklin reads <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em> as ``stand[ing] for several fundamental 
principles, each presenting ... insuperable obstacle to the 
copyrightability of Apple's operating systems.'' It states: 

<p><blockquote> 
   <em>First, Baker</em> teaches that use of a system itself does not infringe a 
copyright on the description of the system.  <em>Second, Baker</em> enunciates the rule 
that copyright does not extend to purely utilitarian works.  <em>Finally, Baker</em> 
emphasizes that the copyright laws may not be used to obtain and hold a monopoly 
over an idea.  In so doing, <em>Baker</em> highlights the principal difference between 
the copyright and patent laws---a difference that is highly pertinent in this 
case.
</blockquote> 
 
   Brief of Appellee at 22. 
 
   Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act, the other ground on which Franklin 
relies, appeared first in the 1976 version, long after the decision in <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>. It provides: 

<p><blockquote> 
   In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship 
extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, 
principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, 
explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.
</blockquote> 
 
   It is apparent that section 102(b) codifies a substantial part of the holding 
and dictum of <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>.  <em>See 1 Nimmer on Copyright</em> 
&#167; 2.18[D], at 2--207. 
 
   We turn to consider the two principal points of Franklin's argument.
 
   1.  <em>``Process'', ``System'' or ``Method of Operation''</em>
 
   Franklin argues that an operating system program is either a
``process'', ``system'', or ``method of operation'' and hence
uncopyrightable.<a name="F8"><a href="#FN8"><sup><fontsize=-2>8</font></sup></a></a> Franklin correctly notes that underlying section 102(b) and
many of the statements for which <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em> is
cited is the distinction which must be made between property subject
to the patent law, which protects discoveries, and that subject to
copyright law, which protects the writings describing such
discoveries.  However, Franklin's argument misapplies that distinction
in this case.  Apple does not seek to copyright the method which
instructs the computer to perform its operating functions but only the
instructions themselves.  The method would be protected, if at all, by
the patent law, an issue as yet unresolved.  <em>See Diamond</em> v.
<em>Diehr</em>, 450 U.S. 175, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155, 101 S. Ct.  1048 (1981).
    
 
   Franklin's attack on operating system programs as ``methods'' or ``processes'' 
seems inconsistent with its concession that application programs are an 
appropriate subject of copyright.  Both types of programs instruct the computer 
to do something.  Therefore, it should make no difference for purposes of 
section 102(b) whether these instructions tell the computer to help prepare an 
income tax return (the task of an application program) or to translate a high 
level language program from source code into its binary language object code 
form (the task of an operating system program such as ``Applesoft'', <em>see</em> 
note 4 <em>supra</em>).  Since it is only the instructions which are protected, 
a``process'' is no more involved because the instructions in an operating system
program may be used to activate the operation of the computer than it would be
if instructions were written in ordinary English in a manual which described 
the necessary steps to activate an intricate complicated machine.  There is, therefore, no reason to 
afford any less copyright protection to the instructions in an operating system 
program than to the instructions in an application program. 
 
   Franklin's argument, receptively treated by the district court, that an 
operating system program is part of a machine mistakenly focuses on the physical 
characteristics of the instructions.  But the medium is not the message.  We 
have already considered and rejected aspects of this contention in the 
discussion of object code and ROM.  The mere fact that the operating system 
program may be etched on a ROM does not make the program either a machine, part 
of a machine or its equivalent.  Furthermore, as one of Franklin's witnesses 
testified, an operating system does not have to be permanently in the machine in 
ROM, but it may be on some other medium, such as a diskette or magnetic tape, 
where it could be readily transferred into the temporary memory space of the 
computer.  In fact, some of the operating systems as issue were on diskette.  As 
the CONTU majority stated, 
 
<blockquote>
   Programs should no more be considered machine parts than videotapes should be 
considered parts of projectors or phonorecords parts of sound reproduction 
equipment. . . .   That the words of a program are used ultimately in the 
implementation of a process should in no way affect their copyrightability. 
</blockquote>
 
   CONTU Report at 21. 
 
   Franklin also argues that the operating systems cannot be copyrighted because 
they are ``purely utilitarian works'' and that Apple is seeking to block the use 
of the art embodied in its operating systems.  This argument stems from the 
following dictum in <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>: 
 
<blockquote>
   The very object of publishing a book on science or the useful arts is to 
communicate to the world the useful knowledge which it contains.  But this 
object would be frustrated if the knowledge could not be used without incurring 
the guilt of piracy of the book.  And where the art it teaches cannot be used 
without employing the methods and diagrams used to illustrate the book, or such 
as are similar to them, such methods and diagrams are to be considered as 
necessary incidents to the art, and given therewith to the public; not given for 
the purpose of publication in other works explanatory of the art, but for the 
purpose of practical application. 
</blockquote>
 
   101 U.S. at 103. We cannot accept the expansive reading given to this 
language by some courts, see, <em>e.g., Taylor Instrument Companies</em> v. 
<em>Fawley-Brost Co</em>., 139 F.2d 98 (7th Cir. 1943), <em>cert. denied</em>, 321 U.S. 785, 88 L. Ed. 1076, 64 
S. Ct. 782 (1944). In this respect we agree with the views expressed by 
Professor Nimmer in his treatise.  <em>See</em> 1 <em>Nimmer on Copyright</em> &#167; 2.18[C]. 
   
 
   Although a literal construction of this language could support Franklin's 
reading that precludes copyrightability if the copyright work is put to a 
utilitarian use, that interpretation has been rejected by a later Supreme Court 
decision.  In <em>Mazer</em> v. <em>Stein</em>, 347 U.S. 201, 218, 98 L. Ed. 630, 74 S. Ct. 460 
(1954), the Court stated: ``We find nothing in the copyright statute to support 
the argument that the intended use or use in industry of an article eligible for 
copyright bars or invalidates its registration.  We do not read such a 
limitation into the copyright law.'' <em>Id</em>. at 218. The CONTU majority also rejected 
the expansive view some courts have given <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>, and stated, ``That the 
words of a program are used ultimately in the implementation of a process should 
in no way affect their copyrightability.'' <em>Id</em>. at 21.  It referred to ``copyright 
practice past and present, which recognizes copyright protection for a work of 
authorship regardless of the uses to which it may be put.'' <em>Id</em>.  The Commission 
continued: ``The copyright status of the written rules for a game <em>or a system for 
the operation of a machine</em> is unaffected by the fact that those rules direct the 
actions of those who play the game or <em>carry out the process</em>.'' <em>Id</em>.  (emphasis 
added).  As we previously noted, we can consider the CONTU Report as accepted by 
Congress since Congress wrote into the law the majority's recommendations almost 
verbatim.  <em>See</em> 18 Cong.Rec. H10767 (daily ed. Nov. 17, 1980) (Rep. Kastenmeier: 
Bill ``eliminates confusion about the legal status of computer software by 
enacting the recommendations of [CONTU] clarifying the law of copyright of 
computer software''); 18 Cong.Rec. S14766 (daily ed. Nov. 20, 1980) (Sen. Bayh: 
``[t]his language reflects that proposed by [CONTU'']). 
 
   Perhaps the most convincing item leading us to reject Franklin's
argument is that the statutory definition of a computer program is a
set of instructions to be used in a computer in order to bring about a
certain result, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 101, makes no distinction between
application programs and operating programs.  Franklin can point to no
decision which adopts the distinction it seeks to make.  In the one
other reported case to have considered it, <em>Apple Computer,
Inc</em>. v. <em>Formula International, Inc</em>., 562 F. Supp. 775
(C.D.Cal. 1983), the court reached the same conclusion which we do,
<em>i.e.</em> that an operating system program is not per se precluded
from copyright.  It stated, ``There is nothing in any of the statutory
terms which suggest a different result for different types of computer
programs based upon the function they serve within the machine.''
<em>Id</em>. at 780.  Other courts have also upheld the
copyrightability of operating programs without discussion of this
issue.  <em>See Tandy Corp</em>. v. <em>Personal Micro Computers,
Inc</em>., 524 F. Supp. at 173 (input-output routine stored in ROM which
translated input into machine language in a similar fashion as
Applesoft and Apple Integer Basic proper subject of copyright);
<em>GCA Corp</em>. v. <em>Chance</em>, 217 U.S.P.Q. at 719--20 (object
code version of registered source code version of operating programs
is the same work and protected).
 
   2.  <em>Idea/Expression Dichotomy</em>
 
   Franklin's other challenge to copyright of operating system programs relies 
on the line which is drawn between ideas and their expression.  <em>Baker</em> 
v. <em>Selden</em> 
remains a benchmark in the law of copyright for the reading given it in 
<em>Mazer</em> v. <em>Stein, supra</em>, where the Court stated, ``Unlike a patent, a copyright gives no 
exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression 
of the idea---not the idea itself.'' 347 U.S. at 217 (footnote omitted). 
 
   The expression/idea dichotomy is now expressly recognized in
section 102(b) which precludes copyright for ``any idea.'' This
provision was not intended to enlarge or contract the scope of
  copyright protection but ``to restate ... the basic dichotomy
between expression and idea remains unchanges.'' H.R. Rep. No. 1476,
<em>supra</em>, at 57, <em>reprinted in</em> 1976 U.S. Code Cong. &
Ad. News at 5670.  The legislative history indicates that section
102(b) was intended ``to make clear that the expression adopted by the
programmer is the copyrightable element in a computer program, and
that the actual processes or methods embodied in the program are not
within the scope of the copyright law.'' <em>Id</em>.
 
   Many of the courts which have sought to draw the line between an idea and 
expression have found difficulty in articulating where it falls.  <em>See, e.g., 
Nichols</em> v. <em>Universal Pictures Corp</em>. 45 F.2d 119, 121 (2d Cir. 1930) (L. Hand, 
J.); <em>see</em> discussion in 3 <em>Nimmer on Copyright</em> &#167; 13.03[A].  We believe that in the 
context before us, a program for an operating system, the line must be a 
pragmatic one, which also keeps in consideration ``the preservation of the 
balance between competition and protection reflected in the patent and copyright 
laws''.  <em>Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp</em>. v. <em>Kalpakian</em>, 446 F.2d 738, 742 (9th 
Cir. 1971). As we stated in <em>Franklin Mint Corp</em>. v. <em>National Wildlife Art 
Exchange, Inc</em>., 575 F.2d 62, 64 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 439 U.S. 880, 58 L. Ed. 
2d 193, 99 S. Ct. 217 (1978), ``Unlike a patent, a copyright protects originality 
rather than novelty or invention.'' In that opinion, we quoted approvingly the 
following passage from <em>Dymow</em> v. <em>Bolton</em>, 11 F.2d 690, 691 (2d Cir. 1926): 
 
<blockquote>
   Just as a patent affords protection only to the means of reducing an 
inventive idea to practice, so the copyright law protects the means of 
expressing an idea; and it is as near the whole truth as generalization can 
usually reach that, <em>if the same idea can be expressed in a plurality of totally 
different manners, a plurality of copyrights may result</em>, and no infringement 
will exist.
</blockquote> 
 
   (emphasis added). 
 
   We adopt the suggestion in the above language and thus focus on whether the 
idea is capable of various modes of expression.  If other programs can be 
written or created which perform the same function as an Apple's operating 
system program, then that program is an expression of the idea and hence 
copyrightable.  In essence, this inquiry is no different than that made to 
determine whether the expression and idea have merged, which has been stated to 
occur where there are no or few other ways of expressing a particular idea. 
<em>See, e.g., Morrissey</em> v. <em>Procter & Gamble Co</em>., 379 F.2d 675, 678--79 (1st Cir. 
1967); <em>Freedman</em> v. <em>Grolier Enterprises, Inc</em>., 179 U.S.P.Q. 476, 478 (S.D.N.Y. 
1973) (``[c]opyright protection will not be given to a form of expression 
necessarily dictated by the underlying subject matter''); CONTU Report at 20. 
 
   The district court made no findings as to whether some or all of Apple's 
operating programs represent the only means of expression of the idea underlying 
them.  Although there seems to be a concession by Franklin that at least some of 
the programs can be rewritten, we do not believe that the record on that issue 
is so clear that it can be decided at the appellate level.  Therefore, if the 
issue is pressed on remand, the necessary finding can be made at that time. 
 
   Franklin claims that whether or not the programs can be rewritten, there are 
a limited ``number of ways to arrange operating systems to enable a computer to 
run the vast body of Apple-compatible software'', Brief of Appellee at 20.  This 
claim has no pertinence to either the idea/expression dichotomy or merger.  The 
idea which may merge with the expression, thus making the copyright unavailable, 
is the idea which is the subject of the expression.  The idea of one of the 
operating system programs is, for example, how to translate source code into 
object code.  If other methods of expressing that idea are not foreclosed as a 
practical matter, then there is no merger.  Franklin may wish to achieve total 
compatibility with independently developed application programs written for the 
Apple II, but that is a commercial and competitive objective which does not 
enter into the somewhat metaphysical issue of whether particular ideas and 
expressions have merged. 
 
   In summary, Franklin's contentions that operating system programs are <em>per se</em> 
not copyrightable is unpersuasive.  The other courts before whom this issue has 
been raised have rejected the distinction.  Neither the CONTU majority nor 
Congress made a distinction between operating and application programs.  We 
believe that the 1980 amendments reflect Congress' receptivity to 
new technology and its desire to encourage, through the copyright laws, 
continued imagination and creativity in computer programming.  Since we believe 
that the district court's decision on the preliminary injunction was, to a large 
part, influenced by an erroneous view of the availability of copyright for 
operating system programs and unnecessary concerns about object code and ROMs, 
we must reverse the denial of the preliminary injunction and remand for 
reconsideration.

D.

<p><em>Irreparable Harm</em>
</center> 
 
<p>
   The district court, without any extended discussion, found that Apple had not 
made the requisite showing of irreparable harm, stating ``Apple is better suited 
to withstand whatever injury it might sustain during litigation than is Franklin 
to withstand the effects of a preliminary injunction.'' 545 F. Supp. at 812, 825. 
In so ruling, the district court failed to consider the prevailing view that a 
showing of a prima facie case of copyright infringement or reasonable likelihood 
of success on the merits raises a presumption of irreparable harm.  <em>See, e.g., 
Atari, Inc</em>. v. <em>North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp</em>., 672 F.2d 607, 
620 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 459 U.S. 880, 103 S. Ct. 176, 74 L. Ed. 2d 145 
(1982); <em>Wainwright Securities Inc</em>. v. <em>Wall Street Transcript Corp</em>., 558 F.2d 91, 
94 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied</em>, 434 U.S. 1014, 54 L. Ed. 2d 759, 98 S. Ct. 730 
(1978); <em>Klitzner Industries, Inc</em>. v. <em>H.K. James Co</em>., 535 F. Supp. 1249, 1259 
(E.D.Pa. 1982); <em>Custom Decor, Inc</em>. v. <em>Nautical Crafts, Inc</em>., 502 F. Supp. 154, 
157 (E.D.Pa. 1980). A copyright plaintiff who makes out a prima facie case of 
infringement is entitled to a preliminary injunction without a detailed showing 
of irreparable harm.  <em>See</em> 3 <em>Nimmer on Copyright</em> &#167; 14.06[A], at 14--50 & n.16 (collecting authorities). 
 
   The CONTU Final Report recognized that ``[t]he cost of developing computer 
programs is far greater than the cost of their duplication.'' CONTU Report at 11. 
Apple introduced substantial evidence of the considerable time and money it had 
invested in the development of the computer programs in suit.  Thus even without 
the presumption of irreparable harm generally applied in copyright infringement 
cases, the jeopardy to Apple's investment and competitive position caused by 
Franklin's wholesale copying of many of its key operating programs would satisfy 
the requirement of irreparable harm needed to support a preliminary injunction.
<em>See Atari, Inc</em>. v. <em>North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp</em>., 672 F.2d 
at 620; <em>Custom Decor, Inc</em>. v. <em>Nautical Crafts Inc</em>., 502 F. Supp. 154, 157 
(E.D.Tenn. 1980); <em>Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp</em>. v. <em>Zale Corp</em>., 323 F. Supp. 
1234, 1238 (S.D.N.Y. 1971). 
 
   In <em>Kontes Glass Co</em>. v. <em>Lab Glass, inc</em>., 373 F.2d 319, 320--21 (3d Cir. 1967), 
this court appeared to adopt an inverse relationship approach to the irreparable 
harm issue, suggesting that the strength of the required showing of irreparable 
injury varies inversely with the strength of plaintiff's showing of a likelihood 
of success on the merits.  <em>See Midway Mfg. Co</em>. v. <em>Bandai-America, Inc</em>., 546 F. 
Supp. 125, 141--142 (D.N.J. 1982). In <em>Kontes</em>, we were not presented with a case 
in which copyrighted material central to the essence of plaintiff's operations 
was concededly copied, as we are here.  We believe the <em>Kontes</em> approach is best 
suited to those cases where the injury from copying can be fairly considered 
minimal, limited or conjectural.  In those circumstances it provides flexibility 
in applying the equitable remedy of preliminary injunctions through evaluation 
of the irreparable harm factor.  Normally, however, the public interest 
underlying the copyright law requires a presumption of irreparable harm, as long 
as there is, as here, adequate evidence of the expenditure of significant time, 
effort and money directed to the production of the copyrighted material. 
Otherwise, the rationale for protecting copyright, that of encouraging 
creativity, would be undermined.  As Judge Broderick stated in <em>Klitzner 
Industries, Inc</em>. v. <em>H.K. James & Co</em>., 535 F. Supp. at 1259--60:      

<p><blockquote> 
   Since Congress has elected to grant certain exclusive rights to the owner of 
a copyright in a protected work, it is virtually axiomatic that the public 
interest can only be served by upholding copyright protections and, 
correspondingly, preventing the misappropriation of the skills, creative 
energies, and resources which are invested in the protected work. 
</blockquote>
 
   Nor can we accept the district court's explanation which stressed
the ``devastating effect'' of a preliminary injunction on Franklin's
business.  If that were the correct standard, then a knowing infringer
would be permitted to construct its business around its infringement,
a result we cannot condone.  <em>See Atari, Inc</em>. v. <em>North
American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp</em>., 672 F.2d at 620;
<em>cf. Helene Curtis Industries, Inc</em>. v. <em>Church & Dwight
Co</em>., 560 F.2d 1325, 1333 (7th Cir. 1977) (trademark infringement),
<em>cert. denied</em>, 434 U.S. 1070, 55 L. Ed. 2d 772, 98 S. Ct. 1252
(1978). The size of the infringer should not be determinative of the
copyright holder's ability to get prompt judicial redress.

<p><em>Additional Issues</em>
</center> 
 
<p>
   Franklin has raised a number of issues concerning Apple's compliance with 
various statutory formalities such as registration, notice and deposit.  It has 
challenged, in a pending motion to dismiss, the copyrights of the eleven works 
in suit which were deposited in object code format, and which were registered 
under the Copyright Office's ``rule of doubt.''<a name="F9"><a href="#FN9"><sup><fontsize=-2>9</font></sup></a></a> Franklin challenges three 
programs, i.e. Apple Integer Basic, Autostart ROM and DOS 3.3, on the ground 
that they or their predecessors were published without the requisite notice.  We 
do not reach these issue on appeal nor do we consider Franklin's claim that 
Apple's misuse of its copyrights bars their enforcement.  The district court did 
not consider these claims in denying the motion for preliminary injunction. 
There are no factual findings with regard to them.  On remand, they can be 
considered by the district court in the first instance who can also decide the 
extent to which they are relevant, if at all, to a preliminary injunction. 
 
   

<p><center> 
V.
</center> 

 <p>
   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we will reverse the
denial of the preliminary injunction and remand to the district court
for further proceedings in accordance herewith.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN3"></a><a href="#F3">3</a></b>  In contrast to the permanent memory devices a RAM (Random Access Memory) 
is a chip on which volatile internal memory is stored which is erased when the 
computer's power is turned off.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN4"></a><a href="#F4">4</a></b>  The fourteen programs at issue, briefly described, are: 
<blockquote> 
   (1) <em>Autostart ROM</em> is sold as part of the Apple Computer and is embedded on a 
ROM chip.  The program has also been published in source code as part of a 
copyrighted book, the Apple II manual.  When the computer's power is turned on, 
Autostart ROM performs internal routines that turn on the circuits in the 
computer and make its physical parts (e.g. input/output devices, screen, and 
memory) ready for use. 
 
   (2) <em>Applesoft</em> is Apple's version of the Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic 
Instruction Code (BASIC) language.  The program is stored in ROM and is sold as 
part of the computer.  Applesoft translates instructions written in the 
higher-level BASIC language into the lower-level machine code that the computer 
understands. 
 
   (3) <em>Floating-Point BASIC</em> is the same program as Applesoft but is stored on 
disks rather than on ROMs.  It is used in earlier versions of the Apple II 
computer that did not have the Applesoft program in ROM. 
 
   (4) <em>Apple Integer BASIC</em>, another translator program, is stored on the DOS 3.3 
Master Disk.  This program used Apple's first version of BASIC for the Apple II 
computer.  It implements a simpler version of the Applesoft program. 
 
   (5) <em>DOS 3.3</em>, the disk operating system program, provides the instructions 
necessary to control the operation between the disk system (disk drive) and the 
computer itself.  It controls the reading and writing functions of the disks and 
includes other routines which put all the data transfers in sequence.  The DOS 
3.3 Master Disk is sold separately from the computer, and includes several of 
the other operating programs referred to in this note. 
 
   (6) <em>Master Create</em> is stored on a disk.  When a disk is prepared for use the 
DOS 3.3 program is placed on that disk in a form that is dependent on the amount 
of Random Access Memory (RAM) available.  The Master Create program replaces the 
DOS 3.3 on the disk with a version that is independent of the amount of RAM 
available. 
 
   (7) <em>Copy</em>, which is stored on a disk, enables the user to copy programs 
written in Apple Integer BASIC from one disk to another. 
 
   (8) <em>Copy A</em>, also stored on a disk, enables the user to copy programs written 
in Applesoft from one disk to another. 
 
   (9) <em>Copy OBJO</em> contains a file of subroutines used by the Copy and Copy A 
programs. 
 
   (10) <em>Chain</em>, another disk stored program, allows data to be passed between 
different parts of a program when only one part of the program is in RAM at a 
given time.  Thus, Chain preserves data already stored in RAM while another part 
of the program is being loaded into RAM. 
 
   (11) <em>Hello</em>, also disk stored, is the first program executed after the power 
is turned on and a disk is ready for use.  It determines how much RAM is in the 
computer and which version of BASIC needs to be loaded into the computer. 
 
   (12) <em>Boot 13</em> is stored on disk and sold on a Master Disk.  It allows the user 
having a disk controller card that contains the Apple 16-Sector Boot ROM to use 
older versions of the Apple disk operating system. 
 
   (13) <em>Apple 13-Sector Boot ROM</em> is stored in a ROM located on the disk 
controller card plugged into the Mother Board.  By turning on numerous circuits 
on the card and in the Apple II computer, this program causes other parts of the 
disk operating system used for 13-Sector format disks to load. 
 
   (14) <em>Apple 16-Sector Boot ROM</em>, stored in a ROM located on the disk controller

computer programs and uncopyrightable processes or methods of
operation does not always seem to ``shimmer with clarity.'' CONTU

the statements of non-lawyer witnesses without experience in using
statutory language as words of art to be binding admissions against
Apple.

 <p><center>
 <h1>Lotus Development Corporation v.
Borland International, Inc.</h1><br>
United
 States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit<br> 49 F.3d 807<br> 1995

<br>(<em>Aff'd <em>per curiam</em> by evenly divided Court</em>, 116 
S. Ct. 804 (1996))

</center>

<p>  Before Torruella, Chief Judge, Boudin and
Stahl, Circuit Judges.

<p>  Stahl, Circuit Judge.

<p>  This appeal requires us to decide whether a computer menu command
 hierarchy is copyrightable subject matter.  In particular, we must
 decide whether, as the district court held, plaintiff-appellee Lotus
 Development Corporation's copyright in Lotus 1-2-3, a computer
 spreadsheet program, was infringed by defendant-appellant Borland
 International, Inc., when Borland copied the Lotus 1-2-3 menu command
 hierarchy into its Quattro and Quattro Pro computer spreadsheet
 programs.  <em>See Lotus Dev. Corp.</em> v. <em>Borland Int'l,
 Inc.</em>, 788 F.Supp. 78 (D.Mass.1992) (``<em>Borland I</em>'');
 <em>Lotus Dev. Corp.</em> v. <em>Borland Int'l, Inc.</em>, 799
 F.Supp. 203 (D.Mass.1992) (``<em>Borland II</em>''); <em>Lotus Dev.
 Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc.</em>, 831 F.Supp. 202 (D.Mass.1993)
 (``<em>Borland III</em>''); <em>Lotus Dev. Corp.</em> v. <em>Borland
 Int'l, Inc.</em>, 831 F.Supp. 223 (D.Mass.1993) (``<em>Borland IV</em>'').

<p><center>
                                       I.
                                   Background
</center>

<p>  Lotus 1-2-3 is a spreadsheet program that enables users to perform
 accounting functions electronically on a computer.  Users manipulate
 and control the program via a series of menu commands, such as
 ``Copy,'' ``Print,'' and ``Quit.''  Users choose commands either by
 highlighting them on the screen or by typing their first letter.  In
 all, Lotus 1-2-3 has 469 commands arranged into more than 50 menus
 and submenus.

<p>  Lotus 1-2-3, like many computer programs, allows users to write what
 are called ``macros.''  By writing a macro, a user can designate a
 series of command choices with a single macro keystroke.  Then, to
 execute that series of commands in multiple parts of the spreadsheet,
 rather than typing the whole series each time, the user only needs to
 type the single pre-programmed macro keystroke, causing the program
 to recall and perform the designated series of commands
 automatically.  Thus, Lotus 1-2-3 macros shorten the time needed
 to set up and operate the program.  Borland released its first
 Quattro program to the public in 1987, after Borland's engineers had
 labored over its development for nearly three years.
 Borland's objective was to develop a spreadsheet program far superior
 to existing programs, including Lotus 1-2-3.  In Borland's words,
 ``[f]rom the time of its initial release . . . Quattro included enormous
 innovations over competing spreadsheet products.''

<p>  The district court found, and Borland does not now contest, that
 Borland included in its Quattro and Quattro Pro version 1.0 programs
 ``a <em>virtually identical</em> copy of the entire 1-2-3 menu tree.''
 <em>Borland III</em>, 831 F.Supp. at 212 (emphasis in original).  In so
 doing, Borland did not copy any of Lotus's underlying computer code;
 it copied only the words and structure of Lotus's menu command
 hierarchy.  Borland included the Lotus menu command hierarchy in its
 programs to make them compatible with Lotus 1-2-3 so that spreadsheet
 users who were already familiar with Lotus 1-2-3 would be able to
 switch to the Borland programs without having to learn new commands
 or rewrite their Lotus macros.

<p>  In its Quattro and Quattro Pro version 1.0 programs, Borland
 achieved compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3 by offering its users an
 alternate user interface, the ``Lotus Emulation Interface.''  By
 activating the Emulation Interface, Borland users would see the Lotus
 menu commands on their screens and could interact with Quattro or
 Quattro Pro as if using Lotus 1-2-3, albeit with a slightly different
 looking screen and with many Borland options not available on Lotus
 1-2-3.  In effect, Borland allowed users to choose how they wanted to
 communicate with Borland's spreadsheet programs: either by using menu
 commands designed by Borland, or by using the commands and command
 structure used in Lotus 1-2-3 augmented by Borland-added commands.

<p> Lotus filed this action against Borland in the District of
 Massachusetts on July 2, 1990, four days after a district court held
 that the Lotus 1-2-3 ``menu structure, taken as a whole--including
 the choice of command terms [and] the structure and order of those
 terms,'' was protected expression covered by Lotus's copyrights.
 <em>Lotus Dev. Corp.</em> v. <em>Paperback Software Int'l</em>, 740
 F.Supp. 37, 68, 70 (D.Mass.1990)
 (``<em>Paperback</em>'').<a name="F1_1"><a href="#FN1_1"><sup><fontsize=-2>1</font></sup></a></a>  Three days earlier, on
 the morning after the <em>Paperback</em> decision, Borland had filed a
 declaratory judgment action against Lotus in the Northern District of
 California, seeking a declaration of non-infringement.  On September
 10, 1990, the district court in California dismissed Borland's
 declaratory judgment action in favor of this action.

<p>  Lotus and Borland filed cross motions for summary judgment; the
 district court denied both motions on March 20, 1992, concluding that
 ``neither party's motion is supported by the record.''  <em>Borland I</em>, 788
 F.Supp. at 80.  The district court invited the parties to file
 renewed summary judgment motions that would ``focus their arguments
 more precisely'' in light of rulings it had made in conjunction with
 its denial of their summary judgment motions.  <em>Id.</em>  at 82.  Both
 parties filed renewed motions for summary judgment on April 24, 1992.
 In its motion, Borland contended that the Lotus 1-2-3 menus were not
 copyrightable as a matter of law and that no reasonable trier of fact
 could find that the similarity between its products and Lotus 1-2-3
 was sufficient to sustain a determination of infringement.  Lotus
 contended in its motion that
 Borland had copied Lotus 1-2-3's entire user interface and had
 thereby infringed Lotus's copyrights.

<p>  On July 31, 1992, the district court denied Borland's motion and
 granted Lotus's motion in part.  The district court ruled that the
 Lotus menu command hierarchy was copyrightable expression because
 <blockquote> [a] very satisfactory spreadsheet menu tree can be
 constructed using different commands and a different command
 structure from those of Lotus 1-2- 3.  In fact, Borland has
 constructed just such an alternate tree for use in Quattro Pro's
 native mode.  Even if one holds the arrangement of menu commands
 constant, it is possible to generate literally millions of
 satisfactory menu trees by varying the menu commands
 employed.</blockquote> <em>Borland II</em>, 799 F.Supp. at 217.  The
 district court demonstrated this by offering alternate command words
 for the ten commands that appear in Lotus's main menu.  <em>Id.</em>
 For example, the district court stated that ``[t]he `Quit' command
 could be named `Exit' without any other modifications,'' and that
 ``[t]he `Copy' command could be called `Clone,' `Ditto,' `Duplicate,'
 `Imitate,' `Mimic,' `Replicate,' and `Reproduce,' among others.''
 <em>Id.</em> Because so many variations were possible, the district
 court concluded that the Lotus developers' choice and arrangement of
 command terms, reflected in the Lotus menu command hierarchy,
 constituted copyrightable expression.

<p>  In granting partial summary judgment to Lotus, the district court
 held that Borland had infringed Lotus's copyright in Lotus 1-2-3:
 <blockquote> [A]s a matter of law, Borland's Quattro products
 infringe the Lotus 1-2-3 copyright because of (1) the extent of
 copying of the ``menu commands'' and ``menu structure'' that is not
 <em>genuinely</em> disputed in this case, (2) the extent to which the
 copied elements of the ``menu commands'' and ``menu structure''
 contain expressive aspects separable from the functions of the ``menu
 commands'' and ``menu structure,'' and (3) the scope of those copied
 expressive aspects as an integral part of Lotus 1-2-3.</blockquote>
 <em>Borland II</em>, 799 F.Supp. at 223 (emphasis in original). The
 court nevertheless concluded that while the Quattro and Quattro Pro
 programs infringed Lotus's copyright, Borland had not copied the
 entire Lotus 1-2-3 user interface, as Lotus had contended.
 Accordingly, the court concluded that a jury trial was necessary to
 determine the scope of Borland's infringement, including whether
 Borland copied the long prompts<a name="F1_2"><a href="#FN1_2"><sup><fontsize=-2>2</font></sup></a></a> of Lotus 1-2-3, whether the long prompts contained expressive
 elements, and to what extent, if any, functional constraints limited
 the number of possible ways that the Lotus menu command hierarchy
 could have been arranged at the time of its creation.  <em>See
 Borland III</em>, 831 F.Supp. at 207.  Additionally, the district court
 granted Lotus summary judgment on Borland's affirmative defense of
 waiver, but not on its affirmative defenses of laches and estoppel.
 <em>Borland II</em>, 799 F.Supp. at 222-23.

<p>  Immediately following the district court's summary judgment
 decision, Borland removed the Lotus Emulation Interface from its
 products.  Thereafter, Borland's spreadsheet programs no longer
 displayed the Lotus 1-2-3 menus to Borland users, and as a result
 Borland users could no longer communicate with Borland's programs as
 if they were using a more sophisticated version of Lotus 1-2-3.
 Nonetheless, Borland's programs continued to be partially compatible
 with Lotus 1-2-3, for Borland retained what it called the ``Key
 Reader'' in its Quattro Pro programs.  Once turned on, the Key Reader
 allowed Borland's programs to understand and perform some Lotus 1-2-3
 macros.<a name="F1_3"><a href="#FN1_3"><sup><fontsize=-2>3</font></sup></a></a> With the Key Reader on, the
 Borland programs used Quattro Pro menus for display, interaction, and
 macro execution, except when they encountered a slash (``/'') key in
 a macro (the starting key for any Lotus 1-2-3 macro), in which case
 they interpreted the macro as having been written for Lotus 1-2-3.
 Accordingly, people who wrote or purchased macros to shorten the time
 needed to perform an operation in Lotus 1-2-3 could still use those
 macros in Borland's programs.<a name="F1_4"><a href="#FN1_4"><sup><fontsize=-2>4</font></sup></a></a> The district court permitted Lotus to file a
 supplemental complaint alleging that the Key Reader infringed its
 copyright.

<p>  The parties agreed to try the remaining liability issues without a
 jury.  The district court held two trials, the Phase I trial covering
 all remaining issues raised in the original complaint (relating to
 the Emulation Interface) and the Phase II trial covering all issues
 raised in the supplemental complaint (relating to the Key Reader).
 At the Phase I trial, there were no live witnesses, although
 considerable testimony was presented in the form of affidavits and
 deposition excerpts.  The district court ruled upon evidentiary
 objections counsel interposed.  At the Phase II trial, there were two
 live witnesses, each of whom demonstrated the programs for the
 district court.  After the close of the Phase I trial, the district
 court permitted Borland to amend its answer to include the
 affirmative defense of ``fair use.''  Because Borland had presented
 all of the evidence supporting its fair-use defense during the Phase
 I trial, but Lotus had not presented any evidence on fair use (as the
 defense had not been raised before the conclusion of the Phase I
 trial), the district court considered Lotus's motion for judgment on
 partial findings of fact.  <em>See</em> Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c).
 The district court held that Borland had failed to show that its use
 of the Lotus 1-2-3 menu command hierarchy in its Emulation Interface
 was a fair use.  <em>See Borland III</em>, 831 F.Supp. at 208.

<p>  In its Phase I-trial decision, the district court found that ``each
 of the Borland emulation interfaces contains a virtually identical
 copy of the 1-2-3 menu tree and that the 1-2-3 menu tree is capable
 of a wide variety of expression.''  <em>Borland III</em>, 831 F.Supp. at 218.
 The district court also rejected Borland's affirmative defenses of
 laches and estoppel.  <em>Id.</em> at 218-23.

<p>  In its Phase II-trial decision, the district court found that
 Borland's Key Reader file included ``a virtually identical copy of
 the Lotus menu tree structure, but represented in a different form
 and with first letters of menu command names in place of the full
 menu command names.''  <em>Borland IV</em>, 831 F.Supp. at 228.  In
 other words, Borland's programs no longer included the Lotus command
 terms, but only their first letters.  The district court held that
 ``the Lotus menu structure, organization, and first letters of the
 command names . . . constitute part of the protectable expression found
 in [Lotus 1-2- 3].''  <em>Id.</em> at 233.  Accordingly, the district
 court held that with its Key Reader, Borland had infringed Lotus's
 copyright.  <em>Id.</em> at 245.  The district court also rejected
 Borland's affirmative defenses of waiver, laches, estoppel, and fair
 use.  <em>Id.</em> at 235-45.  The district court then entered a
 permanent injunction against Borland, <em>id.</em> at 245, from which
 Borland appeals.

<p>  This appeal concerns only Borland's copying of the Lotus menu
 command hierarchy into its Quattro programs and Borland's affirmative
 defenses to such copying.  Lotus has not cross-appealed; in other
 words, Lotus does not contend on appeal that the district court erred
 in finding that Borland had not copied other elements of Lotus 1-2-3,
 such as its screen displays.

<p>  <center>
                                    II.
                                   Discussion
</center>

<p>  On appeal, Borland does not dispute that it factually copied the
 words and arrangement of the Lotus menu command hierarchy.  Rather,
 Borland argues that it ``lawfully copied the unprotectable menus of
 Lotus 1-2-3.''  Borland contends that the Lotus menu command hierarchy
 is not copyrightable because it is a system, method of operation,
 process, or procedure foreclosed from protection by 17 U.S.C. s
 102(b).  Borland also raises a number of affirmative defenses.

<p><center>
   A. Copyright Infringement Generally
</center>

<p>  To establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff must prove ``(1)
 ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent
 elements of the work that are original.''  <em>Feist Publications,
 Inc.</em> v. <em>Rural Tel. Serv. Co.</em>, 499 U.S. 340, 361, 111
 S.Ct. 1282, 1296, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991); <em>see also Data Gen.
 Corp.</em> v. <em>Grumman Sys. Support Corp.</em> 36 F.3d 1147, 1160
 n. 19 (1st Cir. 1994); <em>Concrete Mach. Co.</em> v. <em>Classic
 Lawn Ornaments, Inc.</em>, 843 F.2d 600, 605 (1st Cir. 1988).  To show
 ownership of a valid copyright and therefore satisfy <em>Feist</em>'s
 first prong, a plaintiff must prove that the work as a whole is
 original and that the plaintiff complied with applicable statutory
 formalities.  <em>See Engineering Dynamics, Inc.</em> v.
 <em>Structural Software, Inc.</em>, 26 F.3d 1335, 1340 (5th Cir.
 1994).  ``In judicial proceedings, a certificate of copyright
 registration constitutes prima facie evidence of copyrightability and
 shifts the burden to the defendant to demonstrate why the copyright
 is not valid.''  <em>Bibbero Sys., Inc.</em> v. <em>Colwell Sys.,
 Inc.</em>, 893 F.2d 1104, 1106 (9th Cir. 1990); see also 17
 U.S.C. &#167; 410(c); <em>Folio Impressions, Inc.</em> v. <em>Byer
 California</em>, 937 F.2d 759, 763 (2d Cir. 1991) (presumption of validity
 may be rebutted).

<p>  To show actionable copying and therefore satisfy <em>Feist</em>'s
 second prong, a plaintiff must first prove that the alleged infringer
 copied plaintiff's copyrighted work as a factual matter; to do this,
 he or she may either present direct evidence of factual copying or,
 if that is unavailable, evidence that the alleged infringer had
 access to the copyrighted work and that the offending and copyrighted
 works are so similar that the court may infer that there was factual
 copying (<em>i.e.</em>, probative similarity).  <em>Engineering
 Dynamics</em>, 26 F.3d at 1340; <em>see also Concrete Mach.</em>, 843 F.2d
 at 606.  The plaintiff must then prove that the copying of
 copyrighted material was so extensive that it rendered the offending
 and copyrighted works substantially similar.  <em>See Engineering
 Dynamics</em>, 26 F.3d at 1341.

<p>  In this appeal, we are faced only with whether the Lotus menu
 command hierarchy is copyrightable subject matter in the first
 instance, for Borland concedes that Lotus has a valid copyright in
 Lotus 1-2-3 as a whole<a name="F1_5"><a href="#FN1_5"><sup><fontsize=-2>5</font></sup></a></a> and admits to factually copying the Lotus menu
 command hierarchy.  As a result, this appeal is in a very different
 posture from most copyright-infringement cases, for copyright
 infringement generally turns on whether the defendant has copied
 protected expression as a factual matter.  Because of this different
 posture, most copyright-infringement cases provide only limited help
 to us in deciding this appeal.  This is true even with respect to
 those copyright- infringement cases that deal with computers and
 computer software.

<p><center>
  B. Matter of First Impression
</center>

<p>  Whether a computer menu command hierarchy constitutes copyrightable
 subject matter is a matter of first impression in this court.  While
 some other courts appear to have touched on it briefly in
 <em>dicta</em>, <em>see, e.g.</em>, <em>Autoskill, Inc.</em> v.
 <em>National Educ. Support Sys., Inc.</em>, 994 F.2d 1476, 1495 n. 23
 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em> ___
 U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct.  307, 126 L.Ed.2d 254 (1993), we
 know of no cases that deal with the copyrightability of a menu
 command hierarchy standing on its own (<em>i.e.</em>, without other elements
 of the user interface, such as screen displays, in issue).  Thus we
 are navigating in uncharted waters.

<p>  Borland vigorously argues, however, that the Supreme Court charted
 our course more than 100 years ago when it decided <em>Baker</em> v.
 <em>Selden</em>, 101 U.S. 99, 25 L.Ed. 841 (1879).  In <em>Baker</em> v.
 <em>Selden</em>, the Court held that Selden's copyright over the
 textbook in which he explained his new way to do accounting did not
 grant him a monopoly on the use of his accounting
 system.<a name="F1_6"><a href="#FN1_6"><sup><fontsize=-2>6</font></sup></a></a> Borland argues:
<blockquote>
   The facts of <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>, and even the arguments
 advanced by the parties in that case, are identical to those in this
 case.  The only difference is that the ``user interface'' of Selden's
 system was implemented by pen and paper rather than by computer.
</blockquote>
  To demonstrate that Baker v. Selden and this appeal both involve
 accounting systems, Borland even supplied this court with a video
 that, with special effects, shows Selden's paper forms ``melting''
 into a computer screen and transforming into Lotus 1-2-3.

<p>  We do not think that <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em> is nearly as
 analogous to this appeal as Borland claims.  Of course, Lotus 1-2-3
 is a computer spreadsheet, and as such its grid of horizontal rows
 and vertical columns certainly resembles an accounting ledger or any
 other paper spreadsheet.  Those grids, however, are not at issue in
 this appeal for, unlike Selden, Lotus does not claim to have a
 monopoly over its accounting system.  Rather, this appeal involves
 Lotus's monopoly over the commands it uses to operate the computer.
 Accordingly, this appeal is not, as Borland contends, ``identical''
 to <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>.

<p><center>
  C. Altai
</center>

<p>  Before we analyze whether the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a
 system, method of operation, process, or procedure, we first consider
 the applicability of the test the Second Circuit set forth in
 <em>Computer Assoc. Int'l, Inc.</em> v. <em>Altai, Inc.</em>, 982 F.2d
 693 (2d Cir. 1992).<a name="F1_7"><a href="#FN1_7"><sup><fontsize=-2>7</font></sup></a></a> The Second Circuit designed its <em>Altai</em> test
 to deal with the fact that computer programs, copyrighted as
 ``literary works,'' can be infringed by what is known as
 ``nonliteral'' copying, which is copying that is paraphrased or
 loosely paraphrased rather than word for word.  <em>See id.</em> at
 701 (citing nonliteral-copying cases); see also 3 Melville
 B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright &#167; 13.03[A][1]
 (1993).  When faced with nonliteral-copying cases, courts must
 determine whether similarities are due merely to the fact that the
 two works share the same underlying idea or whether they instead
 indicate that the second author copied the first author's expression.
 The Second Circuit designed its <em>Altai</em> test to deal with this
 situation in the computer context, specifically with whether one
 computer program copied nonliteral expression from another program's
 code.

<p>  The <em>Altai</em> test involves three steps: abstraction, filtration,
 and comparison.  The abstraction step requires courts to ``dissect
 the allegedly copied program's structure and isolate each level of
 abstraction contained within it.''  <em>Altai</em>, 982 F.2d at 707.
 This step enables courts to identify the appropriate framework within
 which to separate protectable expression from unprotected ideas.
 Second, courts apply a ``filtration'' step in which they examine
 ``the structural components at each level of abstraction to determine
 whether their particular inclusion at that level was `idea' or was
 dictated by considerations of efficiency, so as to be necessarily
 incidental to that idea; required by factors external to the program
 itself; or taken from the public domain.''  <em>Id.</em> Finally,
 courts compare the protected elements of the infringed work (<em>i.e.</em>,
 those that survived the filtration screening) to the corresponding
 elements of the allegedly infringing work to determine whether there
 was sufficient copying of protected material to constitute
 infringement.  <em>Id.</em> at 710.  In the instant appeal, we are not
 confronted with alleged nonliteral copying of computer code.  Rather,
 we are faced with Borland's deliberate, literal copying of the Lotus
 menu command hierarchy.  Thus, we must determine not whether
 nonliteral copying occurred in some amorphous sense, but rather
 whether the literal copying of the Lotus menu command hierarchy
 constitutes copyright infringement.  While the <em>Altai</em> test may
 provide a useful framework for assessing the alleged nonliteral
 copying of computer code, we find it to be of little help in
 assessing whether the literal copying of a menu command hierarchy
 constitutes copyright infringement.  In fact, we think that the
 <em>Altai</em> test in this context may actually be misleading because,
 in instructing courts to abstract the various levels, it seems to
 encourage them to find a base level that includes copyrightable
 subject matter that, if literally copied, would make the copier
 liable for copyright infringement.<a name="F1_8"><a href="#FN1_8"><sup><fontsize=-2>8</font></sup></a></a> While that base (or literal) level would not
 be at issue in a nonliteral-copying case like <em>Altai</em>, it is
 precisely what is at issue in this appeal.  We think that abstracting
 menu command hierarchies down to their individual word and menu
 levels and then filtering idea from expression at that stage, as both
 the <em>Altai</em> and the district court tests require, obscures the
 more fundamental question of whether a menu command hierarchy can be
 copyrighted at all.  The initial inquiry should not be whether
 individual components of a menu command hierarchy are expressive, but
 rather whether the menu command hierarchy as a whole can be
 copyrighted.  <em>But see Gates Rubber Co.</em> v. <em>Bando
 Chem. Indus., Ltd.</em>, 9 F.3d 823 (10th Cir. 1993) (endorsing
 <em>Altai</em>'s abstraction-filtration-comparison test as a way of
 determining whether ``menus and sorting criteria'' are
 copyrightable).

<p><center>
  D. The Lotus Menu Command Hierarchy: A ``Method of Operation'' 
</center>

<p> Borland argues that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is
 uncopyrightable because it is a system, method of operation, process,
 or procedure foreclosed from copyright protection by 17 U.S.C. &#167;
 102(b).  Section 102(b) states: ``In no case does copyright
 protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea,
 procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle,
 or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described,
 explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.''  Because we
 conclude that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a method of
 operation, we do not consider whether it could also be a system,
 process, or procedure.  We think that ``method of operation,'' as
 that term is used in &#167; 102(b), refers to the means by which a person
 operates something, whether it be a car, a food processor, or a
 computer.  Thus a text describing how to operate something would not
 extend copyright protection to the method of operation itself; other
 people would be free to employ that method and to describe it in
 their own words.  Similarly, if a new method of operation is used
 rather than described, other people would still be free to employ or
 describe that method.  We hold that the Lotus menu command hierarchy
 is an uncopyrightable ``method of operation.''  The Lotus menu
 command hierarchy provides the means by which users control and
 operate Lotus 1-2-3.  If users wish to copy material, for example,
 they use the ``Copy'' command.  If users wish to print material, they
 use the ``Print'' command.  Users must use the command terms to tell
 the computer what to do.  Without the menu command hierarchy, users
 would not be able to access and control, or indeed make use of, Lotus
 1-2-3's functional capabilities.  The Lotus menu command hierarchy
 does not merely explain and present Lotus 1- 2-3's functional
 capabilities to the user; it also serves as the method by which the
 program is operated and controlled.  The Lotus menu command hierarchy
 is different from the Lotus long prompts, for the long prompts are
 not necessary to the operation of the program; users could operate
 Lotus 1-2-3 even if there were no long prompts.<a name="F1_9"><a href="#FN1_9"><sup><fontsize=-2>9</font></sup></a></a> The Lotus menu command hierarchy is also different from
 the Lotus screen displays, for users need not ``use'' any expressive
 aspects of the screen displays in order to operate Lotus 1-2-3;
 because the way the screens look has little bearing on how users
 control the program, the screen displays are not part of Lotus
 1-2-3's ``method of operation.''<a name="F1_10"><a href="#FN1_10"><sup><fontsize=-2>10</font></sup></a></a>  The Lotus menu command hierarchy is also different
 from the underlying computer code, because while code is necessary
 for the program to work, its precise formulation is not.  In other
 words, to offer the same capabilities as Lotus 1-2-3, Borland did not
 have to copy Lotus's underlying code (and indeed it did not); to
 allow users to operate its programs in substantially the same way,
 however, Borland had to copy the Lotus menu command hierarchy.  Thus
 the Lotus 1-2-3 code is not a uncopyrightable ``method of
 operation.''<a name="F1_11"><a href="#FN1_11"><sup><fontsize=-2>11</font></sup></a></a>

<p>  The district court held that the Lotus menu command hierarchy, with
 its specific choice and arrangement of command terms, constituted an
 ``expression'' of the ``idea'' of operating a computer program with
 commands arranged hierarchically into menus and submenus.
 <em>Borland II</em>, 799 F.Supp. at 216.  Under the district court's
 reasoning, Lotus's decision to employ hierarchically arranged command
 terms to operate its program could not foreclose its competitors from
 also employing hierarchically arranged command terms to operate their
 programs, but it did foreclose them from employing the specific
 command terms and arrangement that Lotus had used.  In effect, the
 district court limited Lotus 1-2-3's ``method of operation'' to an
 abstraction.  Accepting the district court's finding that the Lotus
 developers made some expressive choices in choosing and arranging the
 Lotus command terms, we nonetheless hold that that expression is not
 copyrightable because it is part of Lotus 1-2-3's ``method of
 operation.''  We do not think that ``methods of operation'' are
 limited to abstractions; rather, they are the means by which a user
 operates something.  If specific words are essential to operating
 something, then they are part of a ``method of operation'' and, as
 such, are unprotectable.  This is so whether they must be
 highlighted, typed in, or even spoken, as computer programs no doubt
 will soon be controlled by spoken words.  The fact that Lotus
 developers could have designed the Lotus menu command hierarchy
 differently is immaterial to the question of whether it is a ``method
 of operation.''  In other words, our initial inquiry is not whether
 the Lotus menu command hierarchy incorporates any
 expression.<a name="F1_12"><a href="#FN1_12"><sup><fontsize=-2>12</font></sup></a></a>  Rather, our initial
 inquiry is whether the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a ``method of
 operation.''  Concluding, as we do, that users operate Lotus 1-2-3 by
 using the Lotus menu command hierarchy, and that the entire Lotus
 menu command hierarchy is essential to operating Lotus 1-2-3, we do
 not inquire further whether that method of operation could have been
 designed differently.  The ``expressive'' choices of what to name the
 command terms and how to arrange them do not magically change the
 uncopyrightable menu command hierarchy into copyrightable subject
 matter.

<p>    Our holding that ``methods of operation'' are not limited to mere
 abstractions is bolstered by <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>.  In
 <em>Baker</em>, the Supreme Court explained that 
<blockquote>
 the teachings of science and the rules and methods of useful art have
 their final end in application and use; and this application and use
 are what the public derive from the publication of a book which
 teaches them. . . .  The description of the art in a book, though
 entitled to the benefit of copyright, lays no foundation for an
 exclusive claim to the art itself.  The object of the one is
 explanation; the object of the other is use.  The former may be
 secured by copyright.  The latter can only be secured, if it can be
 secured at all, by letters-patent.
</blockquote>
  <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>, 101 U.S.  at 104-05.  Lotus wrote
 its menu command hierarchy so that people could learn it and use it.
 Accordingly, it falls squarely within the prohibition on copyright
 protection established in <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em> and codified
 by Congress in &#167; 102(b).  In many ways, the Lotus menu command
 hierarchy is like the buttons used to control, say, a video cassette
 recorder (``VCR'').  A VCR is a machine that enables one to watch and
 record video tapes.  Users operate VCRs by pressing a series of
 buttons that are typically labelled ``Record, Play, Reverse, Fast
 Forward, Pause, Stop/Eject.''  That the buttons are arranged and
 labeled does not make them a ``literary work,'' nor does it make them
 an ``expression'' of the abstract ``method of operating'' a VCR via a
 set of labeled buttons.  Instead, the buttons are themselves the
 ``method of operating'' the VCR.  When a Lotus 1-2-3 user chooses a
 command, either by highlighting it on the screen or by typing its
 first letter, he or she effectively pushes a button.  Highlighting
 the ``Print'' command on the screen, or typing the letter ``P,'' is
 analogous to pressing a VCR button labeled ``Play.''  Just as one
 could not operate a buttonless VCR, it would be impossible to operate
 Lotus 1-2-3 without employing its menu command hierarchy.  Thus the
 Lotus command terms are not equivalent to the labels on the VCR's
 buttons, but are instead equivalent to the buttons themselves.
 Unlike the labels on a VCR's buttons, which merely make operating a
 VCR easier by indicating the buttons' functions, the Lotus menu
 commands are essential to operating Lotus 1-2-3.  Without the menu
 commands, there would be no way to ``push'' the Lotus buttons, as one
 could push unlabeled VCR buttons.  While Lotus could probably have
 designed a user interface for which the command terms were mere
 labels, it did not do so here.  Lotus 1-2-3 depends for its operation
 on use of the precise command terms that make up the Lotus menu
 command hierarchy.  One might argue that the buttons for operating a
 VCR are not analogous to the commands for operating a computer
 program because VCRs are not copyrightable, whereas computer programs
 are.  VCRs may not be copyrighted because they do not fit within any
 of the &#167; 102(a) categories of copyrightable works; the closest they
 come is ``sculptural work.''  Sculptural works, however, are subject
 to a ``useful-article'' exception whereby ``the design of a useful
 article . . . shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural
 work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates
 pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified
 separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the
 utilitarian aspects of the article.''  17 U.S.C. &#167; 101.  A ``useful
 article'' is ``an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function
 that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to
 convey information.''  <em>Id.</em> Whatever expression there may be
 in the arrangement of the parts of a VCR is not capable of existing
 separately from the VCR itself, so an ordinary VCR would not be
 copyrightable.

<p>  Computer programs, unlike VCRs, are copyrightable as ``literary
 works.''  17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a).  Accordingly, one might argue, the
 ``buttons'' used to operate a computer program are not like the buttons
 used to operate a VCR, for they are not subject to a useful-article
 exception.  The response, of course, is that the arrangement of
 buttons on a VCR would not be copyrightable even without a
 useful-article exception, because the buttons are an uncopyrightable
 ``method of operation.''  Similarly, the ``buttons'' of a computer
 program are also an uncopyrightable ``method of operation.''  

<p> That the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a ``method of operation''
 becomes clearer when one considers program compatibility.  Under
 Lotus's theory, if a user uses several different programs, he or she
 must learn how to perform the same operation in a different way for
 each program used.  For example, if the user wanted the computer to
 print material, then the user would have to learn not just one method
 of operating the computer such that it prints, but many different
 methods.  We find this absurd.  The fact that there may be many
 different ways to operate a computer program, or even many different
 ways to operate a computer program using a set of hierarchically
 arranged command terms, does not make the actual method of operation
 chosen copyrightable; it still functions as a method for operating
 the computer and as such is uncopyrightable. 

<p> Consider also that users employ the Lotus menu command hierarchy in
 writing macros.  Under the district court's holding, if the user
 wrote a macro to shorten the time needed to perform a certain
 operation in Lotus 1-2-3, the user would be unable to use that macro
 to shorten the time needed to perform that same operation in another
 program.  Rather, the user would have to rewrite his or her macro
 using that other program's menu command hierarchy.  This is despite
 the fact that the macro is clearly the user's own work product.  We
 think that forcing the user to cause the computer to perform the same
 operation in a different way ignores Congress's direction in
 &#167; 102(b) that ``methods of operation'' are not copyrightable.  That
 programs can offer users the ability to write macros in many
 different ways does not change the fact that, once written, the macro
 allows the user to perform an operation automatically.  As the Lotus
 menu command hierarchy serves as the basis for Lotus 1-2-3 macros,
 the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a ``method of operation.''  

<p> In holding that expression that is part of a ``method of operation''
 cannot be copyrighted, we do not understand ourselves to go against
 the Supreme Court's holding in <em>Feist</em>.  In <em>Feist</em>, the
 Court explained:
<blockquote>
 The primary objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of
 authors, but to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.  To
 this end, copyright assures authors the right to their original
 expression, but encourages others to build freely upon the ideas and
 information conveyed by a work. 
</blockquote>
 <em>Feist</em>, 499 U.S. at 349-50, 111 S.Ct. at 1290 (quotations and
 citations omitted).  We do not think that the Court's statement that
 ``copyright assures authors the right to their original expression''
 indicates that all expression is necessarily copyrightable; while
 originaql expression is necessary for copyright protection, we do not
 think that it is alone sufficient.  Courts must still inquire whether
 original expression falls within one of the categories foreclosed
 from copyright protection by &#167; 102 102(b), such as being a ``method of
 operation.''

<p>  We also note that in most contexts, there is no need to ``build'' upon
 other people's expression, for the ideas conveyed by that expression
 can be conveyed by someone else without copying the first author's
 expression.<a name="F1_13"><a href="#FN1_13"><sup><fontsize=-2>13</font></sup></a></a> In the
context of methods of operation, however,
 ``building'' requires the use of the precise method of operation
 already employed; otherwise, ``building'' would require dismantling,
 too.  Original developers are not the only people entitled to build
 on the methods of operation they create; anyone can.  Thus, Borland
 may build on the method of operation that Lotus designed and may use
 the Lotus menu command hierarchy in doing so.

<p>  Our holding that methods of operation are not limited to
 abstractions goes against <em>Autoskill</em>, 994 F.2d at 1495 n. 23,
 in which the Tenth Circuit rejected the defendant's argument that the
 keying procedure used in a computer program was an uncopyrightable
 ``procedure'' or ``method of operation'' under &#167; 102(b).  The
 program at issue, which was designed to test and train students with
 reading deficiencies, <em>id.</em> at 1481, required students to
 select responses to the program's queries ``by pressing the 1, 2, or
 3 keys.''  <em>Id.</em>  at 1495 n. 23.  The Tenth Circuit held that,
 ``for purposes of the preliminary injunction, . . . the record showed
 that [this] keying procedure reflected at least a minimal degree of
 creativity,'' as required by <em>Feist</em> for copyright protection.
 <em>Id.</em> As an initial matter, we question whether a programmer's
 decision to have users select a response by pressing the 1, 2, or 3
 keys is original.  More importantly, however, we fail to see how ``a
 student select[ing] a response by pressing the 1, 2, or 3 keys,''
 <em>id.</em>, can be anything but an unprotectable method of
 operation.<a name="F1_14"><a href="#FN1_14"><sup><fontsize=-2>14</font></sup></a></a>

<p>                                     Conclusion
</center>

<p>  Because we hold that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is
 uncopyrightable subject matter, we further hold that Borland did not
 infringe Lotus's copyright by copying it.  Accordingly, we need not
 consider any of Borland's affirmative defenses.  The judgment of the
 district court is

<p><em>Reversed</em>.

<p><spacer type=vertical size=20>

<p>  Boudin, Circuit Judge, concurring.

<p>  The importance of this case, and a slightly different emphasis in my
 view of the underlying problem, prompt me to add a few words to the
 majority's tightly focused discussion.

<p><center>
                                I.
</center>

<p>  Most of the law of copyright and the ``tools'' of analysis have
 developed in the context of literary works such as novels, plays, and
 films.  In this milieu, the principal problem--simply stated, if
 difficult to resolve--is to stimulate creative expression without
 unduly limiting access by others to the broader themes and concepts
 deployed by the author.  The middle of the spectrum presents close
 cases; but a ``mistake'' in providing too much protection involves a
 small cost: subsequent authors treating the same themes must take a
 few more steps away from the original expression.  

<p> The problem presented by computer programs is fundamentally different
 in one respect.  The computer program is a means for causing
 something to happen; it has a mechanical utility, an instrumental
 role, in accomplishing the world's work.  Granting protection, in
 other words, can have some of the consequences of patent protection
 in limiting other people's ability to perform a task in the most
 efficient manner.  Utility does not bar copyright (dictionaries may
 be copyrighted), but it alters the calculus.  

<p> Of course, the argument for protection is undiminished, perhaps even
 enhanced, by utility: if we want more of an intellectual product, a
 temporary monopoly for the creator provides incentives for others to
 create other, different items in this class.  But the ``cost'' side
 of the equation may be different where one places a very high value
 on public access to a useful innovation that may be the most
 efficient means of performing a given task.  Thus, the argument for
 extending protection may be the same; but the stakes on the other
 side are much higher.  

<p> It is no accident that patent protection has preconditions that
 copyright protection does not--notably, the requirements of novelty
 and non-obviousness--and that patents are granted for a shorter
 period than copyrights.  This problem of utility has sometimes
 manifested itself in copyright cases, such as <em>Baker</em> v.
 <em>Selden</em>, 101 U.S. 99, 25 L.Ed. 841 (1879), and been dealt with
 through various formulations that limit copyright or create limited
 rights to copy.  But the case law and doctrine addressed to utility
 in copyright have been brief detours in the general march of
 copyright law.  

<p> Requests for the protection of computer menus present the concern
 with fencing off access to the commons in an acute form.  A new menu
 may be a creative work, but over time its importance may come to
 reside more in the investment that has been made by users in learning
 the menu and in building their own mini-programs--macros--in
 reliance upon the menu.  Better typewriter keyboard layouts may
 exist, but the familiar QWERTY keyboard dominates the market because
 that is what everyone has learned to use.  <em>See</em> P. David,
 <em>CLIO and the Economics of QWERTY</em>, 75 Am.Econ.Rev.
 332 (1985).  The QWERTY keyboard is nothing other than a menu of
 letters. 

<p> Thus, to assume that computer programs are just one more new means of
 expression, like a filmed play, may be quite wrong.  The
 ``form''--the written source code or the menu structure depicted on
 the screen--look hauntingly like the familiar stuff of copyright;
 but the ``substance'' probably has more to do with problems presented
 in patent law or, as already noted, in those rare cases where
 copyright law has confronted industrially useful expressions.
 Applying copyright law to computer programs is like assembling a
 jigsaw puzzle whose pieces do not quite fit. 

<p> All of this would make no difference if Congress had squarely
 confronted the issue, and given explicit directions as to what should
 be done.  The Copyright Act of 1976 took a different course.  While
 Congress said that computer programs might be subject to copyright
 protection, it said this in very general terms; and, especially in
 &#167; 102(b), Congress adopted a string of exclusions that if taken
 literally might easily seem to exclude most computer programs from
 protection.  The only detailed prescriptions for computers involve
 narrow issues (like back-up copies) of no relevance here. 

<p> Of course, one could still read the statute as a congressional
 command that the familiar doctrines of copyright law be taken and
 applied to computer programs, in cookie cutter fashion, as if the
 programs were novels or play scripts.  Some of the cases involving
 computer programs embody this approach.  It seems to be mistaken on
 two different grounds: the tradition of copyright law, and the likely
 intent of Congress. 

<p> The broad-brush conception of copyright protection, the time limits,
 and the formalities have long been prescribed by statute.  But the
 heart of copyright doctrine--what may be protected and with what
 limitations and exceptions--has been developed by the courts through
 experience with individual cases.  B. Kaplan, An Unhurried
 View of Copyright 40 (1967).  Occasionally Congress addresses a
 problem in detail.  For the most part the interstitial development of
 copyright through the courts is our tradition. 

<p> Nothing in the language or legislative history of the 1976 Act, or at
 least nothing brought to our attention, suggests that Congress meant
 the courts to abandon this case-by-case approach.  Indeed, by setting
 up &#167; 102(b) as a counterpoint theme, Congress has arguably
 recognized the tension and left it for the courts to resolve through
 the development of case law.  And case law development is adaptive:
 it allows new problems to be solved with help of earlier doctrine,
 but it does not preclude new doctrines to meet new situations.

<p><center>
                                   II.
</center>

<p> In this case, the raw facts are mostly, if not entirely, undisputed.
 Although the inferences to be drawn may be more debatable, it is very
 hard to see that Borland has shown any interest in the Lotus menu
 except as a fall-back option for those users already committed to it
 by prior experience or in order to run their own macros using 1-2-3
 commands.  At least for the amateur, accessing the Lotus menu in the
 Borland Quattro or Quattro Pro program takes some effort.  

<p> Put differently, it is unlikely that users who value the Lotus menu
 for its own sake--independent of any investment they have made
 themselves in learning Lotus' commands or creating macros dependent
 upon them--would choose the Borland program in order to secure
 access to the Lotus menu.  Borland's success is due primarily to
 other features.  Its rationale for deploying the Lotus menu bears the
 ring of truth. 

<p> Now, any use of the Lotus menu by Borland is a commercial use and
 deprives Lotus of a portion of its ``reward,'' in the sense that an
 infringement claim if allowed would increase Lotus' profits.  But
 this is circular reasoning: broadly speaking, every limitation on
 copyright or privileged use diminishes the reward of the original
 creator.  Yet not every writing is copyrightable or every use an
 infringement.  The provision of reward is one concern of copyright
 law, but it is not the only one.  If it were, copyrights would be
 perpetual and there would be no exceptions.

<p>  The present case is an unattractive one for copyright protection of
 the menu.  The menu commands (<em>e.g.</em>, ``print,'' ``quit'') are
 largely for standard procedures that Lotus did not invent and are
 common words that Lotus cannot monopolize.  What is left is the
 particular combination and sub-grouping of commands in a pattern
 devised by Lotus.  This arrangement may have a more appealing logic
 and ease of use than some other configurations; but there is a
 certain arbitrariness to many of the choices.

<p>  If Lotus is granted a monopoly on this pattern, users who have
 learned the command structure of Lotus 1-2-3 or devised their own
 macros are locked into Lotus, just as a typist who has learned the
 QWERTY keyboard would be the captive of anyone who had a monopoly on
 the production of such a keyboard.  Apparently, for a period Lotus
 1-2-3 has had such sway in the market that it has represented the de
 facto standard for electronic spreadsheet commands.  So long as Lotus
;is the superior spreadsheet--either in quality or in price--there may
 be nothing wrong with this advantage.

<p>  But if a better spreadsheet comes along, it is hard to see why
 customers who have learned the Lotus menu and devised macros for it
 should remain captives of Lotus because of an investment in learning
 made by the users and not by Lotus.  Lotus has already reaped a
 substantial reward for being first; assuming that the Borland program
 is now better, good reasons exist for freeing it to attract old Lotus
 customers: to enable the old customers to take advantage of a new
 advance, and to reward Borland in turn for making a better product.
 If Borland has not made a better product, then customers will remain
 with Lotus anyway.

<p>  Thus, for me the question is not whether Borland should prevail but
 on what basis.  Various avenues might be traveled, but the main
 choices are between holding that the menu is not protectable by
 copyright and devising a new doctrine that Borland's use is
 privileged.  No solution is perfect and no intermediate appellate
 court can make the final choice.

<p>  To call the menu a ``method of operation'' is, in the common use of
 those words, a defensible position.  After all, the purpose of the
 menu is not to be admired as a work of literary or pictorial art.  It
 is to transmit directions from the user to the computer, <em>i.e.</em>, to
 operate the computer.  The menu is also a ``method'' in the dictionary
 sense because it is a ``planned way of doing something,'' an ``order or
 system,'' and (aptly here) an ``orderly or systematic arrangement,
 sequence or the like.''  Random House Webster's College
Dictionary 853
 (1991).

<p>  A different approach would be to say that Borland's use is
 privileged because, in the context already described, it is not
 seeking to appropriate the advances made by Lotus' menu; rather,
 having provided an arguably more attractive menu of its own, Borland
 is merely trying to give former Lotus users an option to exploit
 their own prior investment in learning or in macros.  The difference
 is that such a privileged use approach would not automatically
 protect Borland if it had simply copied the Lotus menu (using
 different codes), contributed nothing of its own, and resold Lotus
 under the Borland label.

<p>  The closest analogue in conventional copyright is the fair use
 doctrine.  <em>E.g., Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc.</em> v.
 <em>Nation Enters.</em>, 471 U.S. 539, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588
 (1985).  Although invoked by Borland, it has largely been brushed
 aside in this case because the Supreme Court has said that it is
 ``presumptively'' unavailable where the use is a ``commercial'' one.
 <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> at 562, 105 S.Ct. at 2231-32.  <em>But see</em>
 <em>Campbell</em> v. <em>Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</em>, ___   
 U.S. ___   , ___   , 114 S.Ct. 1164, 1174, 127
 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994).  In my view, this is something less than a
 definitive answer; ``presumptively'' does not mean ``always'' and, in any
 event, the doctrine of fair use was created by the courts and can be
 adapted to new purposes.  But a privileged use doctrine would
 certainly involve problems of its own.  It might more closely tailor
 the limits on copyright protection to the reasons for limiting that
 protection; but it would entail a host of administrative problems
 that would cause cost and delay, and would also reduce the ability of
 the industry to predict outcomes.  Indeed, to the extent that Lotus'
 menu is an important standard in the industry, it might be argued
 that any use ought to be deemed privileged.  In sum, the majority's
 result persuades me and its formulation is as good, if not better,
 than any other that occurs to me now as within the reach of courts.
 Some solutions (<em>e.g.</em>, a very short copyright period for menus)
 are not options at all for courts but might be for Congress.  In all
 events, the choices are important ones of policy, not linguistics,
 and they should be made with the underlying considerations in view.

 two-line menu; the top line lists the commands from which the user

 because both parties and many of the <em>amici</em> focus on it so
 heavily.  Borland, in particular, is highly critical of the district
 court for not employing the <em>Altai</em> test.  Borland does not,
 however, indicate how using that test would have been dispositive in
 Borland's favor.  Interestingly, Borland appears to contradict its
 own reasoning at times by criticizing the applicability of the
 <em>Altai</em> test.

 is that for literal copying, ``it is not necessary to determine the
 level of abstraction at which similarity ceases to consist of an
 `expression of ideas,' because literal similarity by definition is
 always a similarity as to the expression of ideas.''  3

 long prompts are not before us on appeal, we take no position on

 (1st Cir. 1967) (when the possible ways to express an idea are

 uncopyrightable; when merger occurs, identical copying is
 permitted).

 plaintiff did not show that the defendant had copied the plaintiff's
 menus or keystrokes, so the court was not directly faced with whether
 the menus or keystrokes constituted an unprotectable method of
 operation.  <em>Id</em>.

	</h1>

		    United States District Court for the Western District of
	Wisconsin<br>
	908 F. Supp. 640<br>
	1996

	<P>
	<STRONG> BARBARA B. CRABB</STRONG>, District Judge


	<P>
	   This is a civil action for injunctive and monetary relief brought
	pursuant to the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc/17/overview.html"> 
	Copyright Act,</a> 17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 101 -
	1010, the <a href="/wisc.compcrim.html">
	Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act,</a> Wis. Stat. &#167; 943.70, and
	Wisconsin contract and tort law. The facts are not in
	dispute. Defendants Matthew Zeidenberg and Silken Mountain Web
	Services, Inc., a one-person corporation formed by Zeidenberg,
	purchased copies of plaintiff's Select Phone TM CD-ROM software
	program, downloaded telephone listings stored on the CD-ROM discs to
	Zeidenberg's computer and made the listings available to Internet
	users by placing the data onto an Internet host computer.  Plaintiff
	contends that defendants' actions constitute copyright infringement,
	breach of the express terms of the parties' software licensing
	agreement, a violation of Wisconsin's Computer Crimes Act,
	misappropriation and unfair competition. Defendants argue that the
	data they downloaded from plaintiff's Select Phone TM program were not
	protected by copyright, that defendants did not use Select Phone TM in
	a manner inconsistent with plaintiff's copyright, that they are not
	bound by the software licensing agreement and that plaintiff's state
	law claims are preempted by federal copyright law.

	<P>
	   The case is before the court on the parties' cross motions for
	summary judgment. Jurisdiction is present under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331,
	because plaintiff's copyright claim arises under federal law, and
	under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, because there is complete diversity of
	citizenship among the parties and more than $ 50,000 is at issue.

	<P>
	   I conclude that defendants are entitled to summary judgment in
	their favor.  First, defendants did not infringe plaintiff's
	copyright. Although the software plaintiff developed for its Select
	Phone TM program is protected by copyright, that protection does not
	extend to the telephone listings included on the CD-ROM discs. Second,
	defendants used the protected software for their own individual
	purposes, consistent with plaintiff's copyright, and distributed only
	unprotected data. Defendants never assented to the license agreement
	included in the Select Phone TM user guide and are not bound by
	it. Even if defendants had assented, the license agreement is
	preempted by federal copyright law to the extent plaintiff intended it
	to apply to uncopyrightable data. Finally, plaintiff's remaining state
	law claims are preempted by the Copyright Act because they are
	attempts to avoid federal copyright law.

	<P>
	   From the facts proposed by the parties, I find that the following
	facts are not in dispute.

	<P>
	<STRONG>UNDISPUTED FACTS</STRONG>

	<P>
	   Plaintiff ProCD, Inc., is a Delaware corporation with its principal
	place of business in Danvers, Massachusetts. Defendant Matthew
	Zeidenberg is a Wisconsin citizen residing in Madison, Wisconsin, and
	working on a Ph.D. in computer science. Defendant Silken Mountain Web
	Services, Inc., is a Wisconsin corporation incorporated by defendant
	Zeidenberg on April 27, 1995, with himself as president and sole
	shareholder.

	<P>
	   Plaintiff spent millions of dollars creating a comprehensive,
	national directory of residential and business listings. Plaintiff
	compiled over 95,000,000 residential and commercial listings from
	approximately 3,000 publicly available telephone books. The listings
	include full names, street addresses, telephone numbers, zip codes and
	industry or "SIC" codes where appropriate.  Plaintiff sells these
	listings on CD-ROM discs under the trademark "Select Phone TM," as
	well as under other trade names and trademarks.

	<P>
	   Each of plaintiff's CD-ROM discs contains both telephone listings
	and a software program used to access, retrieve and download the
	data. Plaintiff sells Select Phone TM in boxes containing a set of
	discs and a user guide. The user guide includes a series of terms
	entitled, "Single User License Agreement."  The agreement states in
	its opening paragraph:
	 
	<P>
	<blockquote>
	Please read this license carefully before using the software or
	accessing the listings contained on the discs. By using the discs and
	the listings licensed to you, you agree to be bound by the terms of
	this License. If you do not agree to the terms of this License,
	promptly return all copies of the software, listings that may have
	been exported, the discs and the User Guide to the place where you
	obtained it.
	</blockquote>
	 
	<P>
	The license informs the user that plaintiff's software is copyrighted
	and that copying the software is authorized only for particular
	purposes and uses. Once the product is installed on the user's
	computer, the computer screens remind users that use of the product
	and the data is subject to the Single User License Agreement and that
	the products are licensed for authorized use only. Before a user can
	access the listings a field appears on the computer screen, stating:
	 
	<blockquote>
	The listings contained within this product are subject to a License
	Agreement.  Please refer to the Help menu or to the User Guide.
	 </blockquote>

	<P>
	In addition, most screens contain the following warning:
	<blockquote>
	   The listings on this product are licensed for authorized users
	only. 
	</blockquote>
	The user agreement provides that copying of the software and the data
	may be done only for individual or personal use and that distribution,
	sublicense or lease of the software or the data is prohibited. The
	agreement provides expressly that:

	<blockquote>
	You will not make the Software or the Listings in whole or in part
	available to any other user in any networked or time-shared
	environment, or transfer the Listings in whole or in part to any
	computer other than the computer used to access the Listings.
	</blockquote>

	<P>
	   The Select Phone TM box mentions the agreement in one place in
	small print.  The box does not detail the specific terms of the
	license.

	<P>
	   In late 1994, defendant Zeidenberg purchased a copy of Select Phone
	TM at a local retail store. In February or March 1995, defendant
	Zeidenberg decided he could download data from Select Phone TM and
	make it available to third parties over the Internet for commercial
	purposes. Zeidenberg purchased an updated version of Select Phone TM
	in March 1995 and in April 1995, incorporated Silken Mountain Web
	Services, Inc. for the purpose of making a database of telephone
	listings available over the Internet. In April and May 1995, after
	incorporation, Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc., began assembling
	its own telephone listings database, part of which contained data from
	Select Phone TM and part of which involved data from another company's
	product. Defendants were aware of the computer screen warning message
	notifying them that Select Phone TM was subject to the agreement
	contained in the user guide. Defendants disregarded the screen
	warnings because they did not believe the license to be binding.

	<P>
	   Defendant Zeidenberg is the sole shareholder, sole employee and
	sole officer of defendant Silken Mountain Web Services,
	Inc. Defendants compiled their database by installing Select Phone TM
	on Zeidenberg's personal computer, thereby making a copy of the
	software onto Zeidenberg's computer's hard drive.  Defendants used the
	software on this hard disk copy to download data from the Select Phone
	TM discs to contribute to the corporation's own database.  Every time
	defendants downloaded data from the discs, an additional copy of
	Select Phone TM software was copied into the random access memory
	(RAM) of Zeidenberg's computer.

	<P>
	   Defendant Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc., wrote its own
	computer program to allow users to search its database. No person who
	accessed the Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc. home page used or
	copied plaintiff's Select Phone TM software. The software that
	defendants created permits searches based only on name or standard
	industrial code while plaintiff's software can search a number of
	"fields," such as name, address, telephone number, area code, zip
	code, or any combination of the above.

	<P>
	   In May 1995, defendants entered into a contract with Branch
	Information Systems pursuant to which Branch provided defendants with
	access to the Internet. Defendants uploaded their database onto Branch
	Information Systems' computer and provided access to the database to
	third parties via the Internet.  Plaintiff discovered this activity
	and demanded that defendants discontinue their actions
	immediately. Zeidenberg wrote to plaintiff and admitted downloading
	listings from Select Phone TM and making some of those listings
	available over the Internet but explained that he would continue his
	project.
	<P>
	   After learning of plaintiff's displeasure, Branch Information
	Services stopped doing business with defendants. In August 1995,
	defendants entered into a contract with Ivory Tower Information
	Services for Internet access. The parties contemplated that plaintiff
	would complain and they provided in the contract that Ivory Tower
	Information Services was required to continue providing defendants
	Internet access until ordered by a court to stop.

	<P>
	   Pursuant to this contract, defendants made their database available
	over the Internet until this court issued a preliminary injunction on
	September 22, 1995.  Prior to entry of the preliminary injunction,
	defendants' database was receiving approximately 20,000 "hits" per day
	on the Internet. (A hit occurs each time a new screen is displayed on
	a user's computer screen during a search of the database. Each search
	tends to generate multiple hits.) For each search of defendants'
	database, users are permitted to extract up to 1,000 listings.
	Because the public could access defendants' database for free,
	plaintiff believed its ability to sell Select Phone TM was
	jeopardized.

	<P>
	<STRONG>OPINION    </STRONG>

	<P>
	   Plaintiff commenced this law suit in September 1995 and immediately
	sought a preliminary injunction barring defendants from distributing
	Select Phone TM telephone listings over the Internet. At the hearing
	on its motion for a preliminary injunction, plaintiff's arguments for
	protection of its entrepreneurial effort were sufficiently compelling
	to secure the injunction.  Nonetheless, it was dear then, as it is
	now, that plaintiff had no valid claim to federal copyright protection
	for the raw data contained on its Select Phone TM CD-ROM discs. Now,
	after the parties have briefed the issues more fully, it has become
	evident that plaintiff cannot prevail on its copyright claim even with
	respect to its protected software and that its state law claims are
	similarly unavailing. Plaintiff's arguments boil down to the
	proposition that it is unfair and commercially destructive to allow
	defendants to take the information plaintiff assembled with a
	significant investment of time, effort and money and use it for
	commercial purposes without paying any compensation to
	plaintiff. Although the proposition has substantial equitable appeal,
	it is one that the United States Supreme Court rejected specifically
	in a nearly identical context four years ago. In <i>Feist
	Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc.</i>, 499
	U.S. 340, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358, 111 S. Ct. 1282 (1991), the court held
	that telephone listings are not protected by copyright law and denied
	the claim of a telephone company that sought to prevent competitors
	from using the data it had compiled and published in its
	directories. If this result seems perverse, the remedy lies with
	Congress. See Maureen A. O'Rourke, 41 Fed. B. News &amp; J. 511 (1994)
	(rapidly expanding Internet use will force Congress to address
	difficult question of appropriate level of protection for on-line
	fact-based databases); Jane C. Ginsburg, <i>No "Sweat"?  Copyright and
	Other Protection of Works of Information after Feist v. Rural
	Telephone</i>, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 338 (suggesting a federal
	misappropriation statute to prevent commercial copying of
	non-copyrightable databases by other compilers if public access to
	information were assured through collective licensing).

	<P>
	   It is not surprising that the recent explosive growth of the
	Internet would give rise to lawsuits concerning the ownership of the
	data available through that system. See Jane C. Ginsburg, <i>Putting
	Cars on the "Information Superhighway": Authors, Exploiters, and
	Copyright in Cyberspace,</i> 95 Colum. L.  Rev. 1466 (1995). Defendant
	Zeidenberg is not the first computer student to find himself involved
	in a legal dispute after downloading information and offering it over
	the Internet. In <i>United States v. LaMacchia</i>, 871 F. Supp. 535
	(D. Mass. 1994), a Massachusetts Institute of Technology student set
	up a computer bulletin board and encouraged his correspondents to
	upload copyrighted software that other users could download for
	free. The United States charged the student with criminal copyright
	infringement under the federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167;
	1343. The district court noted the impropriety of the defendant's
	actions but held that his conduct was not punishable under the wire
	fraud statute; copyright law provided the full range of penalties for
	criminal infringement actions and copyright law did not cover
	defendant's noncommercial activities. <i>Id.</i> at 544-45. The LaMacchia
	decision appears to have generated congressional interest. On August
	4, 1995, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced a bill (S. 1122) to ensure
	better copyright protection for creative works available on line. Bill
	to Stiffen Criminal Penalties for Copyright Infringement Introduced, 7
	Journal of Proprietary Rights 26 (1995). The executive branch is also
	well aware of these problems. A presidential study group formed in
	1993 recently released a report entitled, "Intellectual Property and
	the National Information Infrastructure."  The report suggests that
	the Internet will not flourish if significant protection against theft
	and copyright abuse is not offered. Guy Alvarez, <i>New Legal Issues
	on the Net</i>, Am. Law. 28, 29 (Dec. Supp.  1995). Against this
	background, I will take up plaintiff's federal copyright claim.

	<p>
	  <h2> A. Copyright Infringement</h2>

	<P>
	   Select Phone TM is comprised of two elements: 1) the software that
	allows users to access and retrieve the data contained on the CD-ROM
	discs; and 2) the data itself. The difference between these two
	elements is critical. Plaintiff contends that defendants infringed
	plaintiff's copyright when they copied and used Select Phone TM for
	purposes of commercially distributing the listings on the Internet
	because copyright protection extends to both the telephone listings
	and to its software. Defendants argue that the Select Phone TM data is
	not copyrightable but acknowledge that plaintiff has a valid copyright
	in the Select Phone TM software. Nonetheless, defendants contend,
	copyright law permits them to make a copy of the program as long as it
	is essential to their personal use of the program and is not used in a
	manner inconsistent with plaintiff's copyright.
	 
	<p>
	  <h3> 1. Select Phone TM data</h3>

	<P>
	   In <i>Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service
	Co. Inc.</i>, 499 U.S.  340, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358, 111 S. Ct. 1282, the
	Supreme Court held that a telephone company's white pages were not
	entitled to copyright protection because the raw data contained in the
	listings were not arranged in an original manner and lacked the
	minimal degree of creativity necessary to constitute a copyrightable
	compilation of facts. <i>Id.</i> at 362. As the Court noted, <i>Feist</i>
	concerned "the interaction of two well-established propositions. The
	first is that facts are not copyrightable; the other, that
	compilations of facts generally are." <i>Id.</i> at 344. Even a modicum of
	originality may suffice to make a compilation of fact copyrightable,
	but the alphabetical listing of telephone subscriber addresses and
	telephone numbers does not achieve even this minimal degree of
	creativity. <i>Id.</i> at 345. To the argument that it was unfair for the
	publishing company to use the fruits of the telephone company's labor
	without compensating it, the Court gave short shrift. "The primary
	objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of authors, but 'to
	promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts.'" <i>Id.</i> at 349 (citing
	U.S. Const. art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 8). In reaching this conclusion, the
	Court rejected a line of cases applying a "sweat of the brow" theory
	that offered copyright protection to factual compilations as a reward
	for the hard work that goes into compiling facts. <i>Id.</i> at 352. The
	Court explained that the 1976 Copyright Act overruled the "sweat of
	the brow" cases. <i>Id.</i> at 354-55. The Court's overruling of the sweat of
	the brow" theory can be viewed as implementation of Congressional
	intent with respect to federal copyright law.

	<P>
	   Plaintiff does not suggest that the phone listings contained in
	Select Phone are any different from those in <i>Feist</i> for purposes
	of copyright protection. As a collection of facts arranged in a
	commonplace, non-original fashion, the Select Phone TM listings
	themselves are not copyrightable. Without originality, time and effort
	do not factor into the copyright equation. <i>Feist</i>'s result may
	well serve as a disincentive to companies considering the compilation
	of factual databases, see Philip H. Miller, <i>Note, Life after Feist:
	Facts, the First Amendment and the Copyright Status of Automated
	Databases</i>, 60 Fordham L.  Rev. 507, 521-23 (1991) (<i>Feist</i>
	chills incentive to create databases), but <i>Feist</i> struck the
	"careful balance" between fact and expression in copyright law by
	allowing facts to be copied at will in order to advance the
	development of science and art. That disincentives might result was
	not considered important.
	 
	<P>
	<h3>2. Select Phone TM software</h3>

	<P>
	   Although the Select Phone TM data are not protected by federal
	copyright law, the protection attaches to the software component,
	which does represent original expression and creativity. The question
	is whether defendants infringed this copyright by copying the Select
	Phone TM software to Zeidenberg's computer's hard drive for the
	purpose of offering the telephone listings over the Internet. If, as
	defendants argue, they copied the software only for personal use and
	never distributed the software to third parties, they may be entitled
	to the exception from infringement set out in 17 U.S.C. &#167; 117.

	<P>
	   Section 501 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 501, proscribes
	any unauthorized copying of a copyrighted work. A claim for copyright
	infringement requires proof of 1) plaintiff's ownership of a valid
	copyright; and 2) defendant's copying of original elements of
	plaintiff's work. <i>Wildlife Express Corp. v. Carol Wright Sales,
	Inc.</i>, 18 F.3d 502, 507 (7th Cir. 1994). Section 117 of the
	Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 117, offers an important exception to
	restrictions on copying protected computer software. It provides, in
	relevant part:
	 
	<P>
	It is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer
	program to make.  . . another copy or adaptation of that computer
	program provided: (1) that such new copy or adaptation is created as
	an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in
	conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner.

	<P>
	   Congress passed &#167; 117 in 1980 in recognition of the fact that
	computer users might need to make copies of computer software in order
	to utilize that software. <i>Apple Computer, Inc. v. Formula Int'l,
	Inc.</i>, 594 F. Supp.  617, 621 (C.D. Cal.), <i>aff'd</i>, 725 F.2d 521 (9th
	Cir. 1984). Although legislative history surrounding the passage of
	&#167; 117 is sparse, it appears that Congress sought to implement the
	recommendations of CONTU, the National Commission on New Technological
	Uses of Copyright Works. <i>Aymes v. Bonelli</i>, 47 F.3d 23, 26 (2d
	Cir. 1995) (citing H.R. Rep. No. 1307, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., Pt. I, at
	23 (1980), reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6460, 6482). CONTU suggested
	that:
	 
	<blockquote>
	The intent of that section [117] is to provide a legitimate holder of
	a computer program with permission to do that copying of the program
	which is necessary for him to be able to use it in his computer
	without running afoul of possible infringement actions.
	</blockquote>
	<i>Apple Computer</i>, 594 F. Supp. at 621 (citing CONTU Meeting
	No. 19 at 98-99 (Jan.  1978)).

	<P>
	   The parties' dispute focuses on the scope and meaning of the term,
	"essential step." Plaintiff would interpret it as not extending to the
	copying of Select Phone TM onto a computer's hard drive. Plaintiff
	contends that making a copy of Select Phone TM on a hard drive was not
	"essential" to defendants' use of the program: they could have
	utilized the program by booting it into RAM memory every time they
	desired to use it. According to plaintiff, hard drive copies are not
	protected under &#167; 117.

	<P>
	   RAM is an acronym for Random Access Memory and represents that part
	of a computer's memory in which data and computer programs can be
	recorded temporarily. When a computer is turned off, the information
	stored in RAM is lost. See <i>Apple Computer</i>, 594 F. Supp. at
	622. A number of courts have determined that RAM copies of a computer
	program are copies for the purposes of &#167; 117. See <i>MAI
	Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.</i>, 991 F.2d 511, 518 (9th Cir.
	1993), <i>cert. denied</i>, 126 L. Ed. 2d 640, 114 S. Ct. 671 (1994);
	<i>Advanced Computer Services of Michigan, Inc., v. MAI
	Sys. Corp.</i>, 845 F. Supp. 356, 363, 364 n.9 (E.D. Va. 1994)
	(collecting cases); <i>Apple Computer</i>, 594 F. Supp. at 622.
	However, none of these courts has held that hard drive copies made for
	an owner's individual use are not equally "essential" under the rubric
	of &#167; 117.  Plaintiff's logic would lead to the conclusion that
	any copying of a computer program onto the owner's hard drive would
	constitute copyright infringement unless the program developer gave
	the owner specific authorization to make a hard drive copy. This
	conclusion conflicts with both basic patterns of computer use in the
	1990s and the spirit of &#167; 117. The day has passed when it was
	necessary to insert a floppy disk in a disk drive any time a user
	wanted access to a particular program. Today, computer users store
	many of their programs on hard drives and access them from that part
	of the computer's permanent memory. Programs on CD-ROM can be used
	more efficiently by installing the program software on a hard drive
	and then using that hard drive copy in conjunction with a disc
	inserted in the CD-ROM disc drive. Limiting those copies that are
	considered "essential" under &#167; 117 to RAM copies would limit the
	use of computer hard drive copies, flout the purposes of &#167; 117
	and diminish the sales appeal of any new program that took advantage
	of such protection. See Robert A.  Kreiss, <i>Section 117 of the
	Copyright Act</i>, 1991 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 1497, 1524-26 (1991) (contending
	that position that hard drive copies are not "essential" for purposes
	of &#167; 117 would create incredible frustration by requiring the
	continual swapping of floppy disks and should be rejected as "rather
	ridiculous").
	  

	<P>
	   Section 117 is intended to allow persons in rightful possession of
	copies of a program to use them freely without fear of exposure to
	copyright liability.  <i>Aymes</i>, 47 F.3d at 26 (citing CONTU Final
	Report at 31 (1978)). If copyright law prevented computer users from
	making hard drive copies, they would not be able to use their
	purchased programs without fear of infringement. RAM copies may be
	essential copies of a computer program but hard drive copies are just
	as essential for the effective use of today's computer software.

	<P>
	   Copies permitted by &#167; 117 must be made only for an owner's
	personal use, <i>Aymes</i>, 47 F.3d at 26. Odd as it may seem, given
	defendants' subsequent commercial use of the telephone data, the
	undisputed fact is that defendants made no copies of plaintiff's
	software except for their own personal use.  Defendants did not use
	the software in an unauthorized fashion as suggested by plaintiffs'
	citations to <i>Pinkham v. Sara Lee Corp.</i>, 983 F.2d 824 (8th
	Cir. 1992) and <i>Major League Baseball Promotion Corp. v. Colour-Tex,
	Inc.</i>, 729 F. Supp. 1035 (D. N.J. 1990). They used the
	copyrightable software portion of the product only to access and
	download the telephone listings data. Defendants did not offer this
	software over the Internet. Instead, they created a new search program
	to allow Internet users to access the data. In distributing only the
	uncopyrightable data over the Internet, defendants did not disqualify
	themselves from the infringement exception contained in &#167; 117.

	<P>
	   In reaching the conclusion that defendants did not misuse the
	copyrightable component of the Select Phone TM program, it is not
	necessary to adopt the broad proposition asserted by the defendant in
	<i>Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.</i>, 847 F.2d 255, 261 (5th
	Cir. 1988), that software purchasers are free under &#167; 117 to make
	copies of copyrighted software for purposes not intended by the
	copyright owner. In <i>Vault</i>, the defendant used the plaintiff's
	software diskettes, designed to prevent the unauthorized duplication
	of programs placed on them, for the express purpose of devising a
	means to defeat the diskettes' protective function, rather than for
	their intended protective purposes. <i>Id.</i> The plaintiff asserted that
	the phrase "and that it is used in no other manner" in &#167; 117
	means that the statute's protection should not extend to copies made
	for purposes other than those for which the program was
	intended. <i>Id.</i> The court held that the defendant did not infringe the
	plaintiff's copyright, finding that &#167; 117 contains no language to
	suggest that the copy it permits must be put to the use intended by
	the copyright owner and that no dear congressional intent existed to
	the contrary. <i>Id.</i> Here, defendants used Select Phone TM exactly as
	plaintiff intended: to access and download data. There is no obvious
	reason not to extend the &#167; 117 exception to parties who copy a
	copyrighted software program for its intended purpose and use it in
	that manner.

	<P>
	   Although plaintiff acknowledges the distinction between the
	copyrighted and noncopyrighted portions of Select Phone TM, it
	disregards that distinction to some extent. For example, plaintiff
	argues that defendants' actions are tantamount to downloading all of
	Lexis's judicial opinions and offering them for free over the
	Internet. Plaintiff fails to recognize that although federal cases are
	not copyrightable, at least one court has held that legal database
	companies like Lexis may arrange those opinions in such a manner as to
	receive copyright protection. See <i>West Publication Co. v. Mead Data
	Central, Inc.</i>, 799 F.2d 1219 (8th Cir. 1986), <i>cert. denied</i>, 479
	U.S. 1070, 93 L. Ed. 2d 1010, 107 S. Ct. 962 (1987) (West's
	arrangement of legal decisions entails enough intellectual labor and
	originality to receive copyright protection); but see Craig Joyce and
	L. Ray Patterson, <i>Monopolizing the Law: The Scope of Copyright
	Protection for Law Reports and Statutory Compilations</i>, 36 UCLA
	L. Rev. 719 (1989) (criticizing the West decision). Unlike West's
	arrangement of judicial opinions, plaintiff's arrangement of telephone
	listings lacks the minimal level of creativity necessary to gamer
	copyright protection. See Feist 499 U.S.  at 362. Although plaintiff's
	software is protected by copyright law, its compiled data are
	not. Because defendants used the software only to download and access
	the data and did not further distribute this copyrightable
	information, their actions are protected by &#167; 117.

	<P>
	   Defendants contend that the fair use doctrine of 17 U.S.C. &#167;
	107 provides them the right to make an intermediate copy of a
	protected work in order to get at the uncopyrighted parts of a
	work. See <i>Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc.</i>, 977 F.2d
	1510, 1520 (9th Cir. 1992); <i>Atari Games Corp. v.  Nintendo of
	America, Inc.</i>, 975 F.2d 832, 843 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The fair use
	doctrine establishes a defense to an otherwise valid copyright
	infringement claim. <i>Sega</i>, 977 F.2d at 1521. Because I have
	determined that defendants are protected from a copyright infringement
	claim by &#167; 117, it is unnecessary to consider whether they should
	receive &#167; 107 protection as well.

	<P>
	   <h2>B. Software License Agreement</h2>

	<P>
	   Before marketing Select Phone TM, plaintiff recognized the
	potential limitations of copyright law and included an agreement in
	the software package that sought to impose limitations concerning the
	distribution and use of the telephone listings. Plaintiff is not the
	first software producer to seek to protect itself in this
	fashion. Software companies have included such agreements, commonly
	known as "shrinkwrap licenses," with their products since the advent
	of mass market software. (The term "shrinkwrap" refers to the
	transparent plastic in which mass market software is encased. Mark
	A. Lemley, <i>Intellectual Property and Shrinkwrap Licenses</i>, 68
	S. Cal. L. Rev. 1239, 1241 (1995)). Shrinkwrap licenses are intended
	to take the place of any bargains or agreements between mass market
	software producers and users, because the typical software transaction
	does not involve bargained agreements concerning use limitations, but
	a purchase made by a computer user at a retail store or through the
	mail, with little discussion or bargaining between the producer and
	the user. In placing a shrinkwrap license provision on its software
	product, the producer seeks to 1) prohibit unauthorized copies; 2)
	prohibit software rental; 3) prohibit reverse engineering and
	modifications to the software; 4) limit the use of software to one
	central processing unit; 5) disclaim warranties; and 6) limit
	liability. Lloyd L. Rich, <i>Mass Market Software and the Shrinkwrap
	License</i>, 23 Colo. Law. 1321 (1994).

	<P>
	   The widespread use of shrinkwrap licenses has generated intense
	interest in academic and intellectual property fields, but
	surprisingly little litigation.  See <i>Step-Saver Data Sys.,
	Inc. v. Wyse Technology</i>, 939 F.2d 91 (3d Cir. 1991); <i>Vault
	Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.</i>, 847 F.2d 255; <i>Arizona Retail
	Sys., Inc. v.  Software Link, Inc.</i>, 831 F. Supp. 759
	(D. Ariz. 1993). Most commentators view shrinkwrap licenses as being
	of questionable validity, primarily because software users do not have
	an opportunity to bargain over their terms.  See Lemley, <i>supra</i>, 68
	S. Cal. L. Rev. at 1263 n. 107 (citing articles). In addition to
	raising issues of enforceability, shrinkwrap licenses also pose
	important questions about the extent to which individual contract
	provisions can supplement or expand federal copyright protection. It
	is important to analyze these licenses carefully, not only to
	determine their validity but also to ascertain whether they are
	preempted by the Copyright Act.

	<p> 
	  <h3> 1. The user agreement</h3>
	<p>
	   In addressing shrinkwrap licenses, the starting point is how to
	treat a sale of software: as a sale of goods under Article II of the
	Uniform Commercial Code or as a "license" to the user. Most courts
	have chosen the first route and have applied the U.C.C. to mass market
	software transactions. Lemley, <i>supra</i>, 68 S.  Cal. L. Rev. at 1244 n.23
	(citing numerous federal and state law cases); but see <i>Microsoft
	Corp. v. Harmony Computers &amp; Electronics, Inc.</i>, 846
	F. Supp. 208 (E.D. N.Y. 1994). Commentators agree that the
	U.C.C. should apply to computer software transactions. See Bonna Lynn
	Horovitz, <i>Note, Computer Software as a Good Under the Uniform
	Commercial Code: Taking a Byte out of the Intangibility Myth</i>, 65
	B.U.L. Rev. 129 (1985); Lemley, <i>supra</i>, 68 S. Cal. L. Rev.  at 1244
	n.23. I will not address this issue in detail but note only that there
	are sound reasons for treating a software transaction as a sale of
	goods under the U.C.C. rather than as a license: purchasers of mass
	market software do not make periodic payments but instead pay a single
	purchase price, the software company does not retain title for the
	purpose of a security interest and no set expiration date exists for
	the "licensed" right. See Gary W. Hamilton &amp; Jeffrey C. Hood,
	<i>The Shrink-Wrap License--Is It Really Necessary?</i>, 10 Computer
	Law 16 (1993). Plaintiff cites only <i>Microsoft Corp.</i>, 846
	F. Supp. 208, in support of its characterization of the transaction as
	a license. The opinion is not persuasive. The court did not address
	the applicability of the U.C.C. in holding that Microsoft licenses
	rather than sells its products. <i>Id.</i> at 213. Plaintiff is no more
	convincing when it argues that the courts have applied the U.C.C. to
	software transactions only when a sale of hardware is involved. See,
	e.g., <i>Advent Sys. Ltd. v. Unisys Corp.</i>, 925 F.2d 670, 676 (3d
	Cir. 1991)(".  . . we hold that software is a "good" within the
	definition in the Code). In analyzing the parties' transaction, I will
	apply the U.C.C., as adopted by Wisconsin. (For ease of uniform
	reference, I will cite the relevant U.C.C.  provisions, pointing out
	the specific Wisconsin statutory provisions where necessary.)

	<P>
	   Before examining the application of the U.C.C. to plaintiff's user
	agreement, I note two cases that plaintiff cites in support of its
	argument that its user agreement is binding on
	defendants. <i>Barazzotto v. Intelligent Sys., Inc.</i>, 40 Ohio
	App. 3d 117, 532 N.E.2d 148 (1987); <i>McCrimmon v. Tandy Corp.</i>,
	202 Ga. App.  233, 414 S.E.2d 15 (1991), <i>cert. denied</i>, 1992 Ga. LEXIS
	88 (Feb. 4, 1992).  <i>Barazzotto</i> and <i>McCrimmon</i> deserve
	only passing mention because neither addresses the issues of this case
	directly. In <i>Barazzotto</i>, the court held that a manufacturer's
	disclaimer of liability appearing on software packaging was not
	binding as to the retail seller. <i>Id.</i> at 120, 532 N.E.2d at 151. The
	court did not address whether that disclaimer was valid as to the
	software manufacturer.  In <i>McCrimmon</i>, the court enforced a
	limited warranty included by a retail seller on the back of a sales
	receipt when the warranty was available for customer inspection prior
	to purchase, noting that it was the customer's responsibility to read
	the receipt when it was tendered to him at the time of
	purchase. <i>Id.</i> at 236, 414 S.E.2d at 18.

	<P>
	   Defendants did not have the opportunity to inspect the user
	agreement before purchasing Select Phone TM because it was inside the
	packaging box and accordingly, they cannot be held to the same
	standards as those applied in McCrimmon. Plaintiff's argument that
	defendants had the opportunity to inspect the Select Phone TM user
	agreement after their first purchase and thus should be held to their
	knowledge of the agreement on their second and third purchases will be
	addressed later.
	<P>
	   The parties dispute how their transaction should be analyzed under
	Article II of the U.C.C. and suggest three possibilities. The
	agreement could be considered an offer subject to the right of
	inspection under &#167; 2-206, a written confirmation of a previously
	established contract under &#167; 2-207, or a proposed modification of
	a contract under &#167; 2-209. Plaintiff argues that &#167; 2-206
	should apply, contending that acceptance did not occur at the moment
	of payment but was subject to defendants' right of inspection and
	revocation that they did not exercise. In defendants' view, the
	contract for the sale of Select Phone TM was completed at the time of
	sale and the license represents additional terms to which they cannot
	be bound under either &#167; 2-207 or &#167; 2-209.
	 <p>
	  <h4> a. Section 2-206</h4>

	<P>
	   Section 2-206, Wis. Stat. &#167; 402.206, sets forth basic notions
	of offer and acceptance. Under &#167; 2-206, the placement of a
	product such as Select Phone on a store shelf constitutes an
	offer. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Barker v. Allied Supermarket</i>, 596 P.2d 870
	(Okla. 1979). Acceptance occurs in any manner reasonable under the
	circumstances. &#167; 2-206(1)(a). Defendants accepted plaintiff's
	offer to sell Select Phone TM in a reasonable manner at the moment
	they purchased the product by exchanging money for the
	program. <i>Peeters v. State</i>, 154 Wis. 111, 142 N.W.  181 (1913)
	(sales contract results when customer pays purchase price and departs
	with item). Paying for a software program is a reasonable manner of
	accepting the offer implicit in the program's display on a store
	shelf. Defendants' payment for the program constitutes conduct
	sufficient to create a contract under &#167; 2-204, Wis. Stat. &#167;
	402.204, the U.C.C. provision governing initial contract formation,
	which states that:
	 
	<blockquote>
	A contract for the sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient
	to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes
	the existence of such a contract.
	 </blockquote>
	<P>
	Plaintiff cannot reasonably expect that further action from defendants
	would be required to make that sales contract binding. The purchase of
	the product was sufficient to show agreement between the parties.

	<P>
	   Plaintiff argues that defendants' acceptance of the software was
	contingent upon their rights of inspection, rejection or revocation,
	but &#167;&#167; 2-204 and 2-206 do not mention any such
	rights. Sections 2-602 and 2-608, Wis. Stat. &#167;&#167; 402.602 and
	402.608, offer such rights, yet these sections do not apply in this
	context.  Section 2-602 grants buyers receiving a tender or delivery
	of goods an opportunity to inspect the goods before accepting. It
	guarantees that buyers will not be saddled with goods that have been
	damaged or are otherwise unsatisfactory upon arrival, but it does not
	create a right to inspect additional written contractual
	terms. Inspection of new contractual terms is covered under other
	sections of the U.C.C. See U.C.C. &#167;&#167; 2-207 and
	2-209. Section 2-608 allows a purchaser to revoke his acceptance when
	the goods' nonconformity with the contract substantially impairs their
	value. <i>H.B. Fuller Co. v. Kinetic Sys., Inc.</i>, 932 F.2d 681 (7th
	Cir. 1991). Again, the provision exists to offer buyers some form of
	protection when purchased items do not serve their intended purpose.

	<P>
	   Defendants do not contend that the Select Phone TM product failed
	to work as they thought it would. Rather, their dispute concerns the
	manner in which the contract limits their use of the product and, as
	such, is more appropriately viewed under &#167; 2-207 or &#167;
	2-209. Plaintiff cites one case in support of its argument that &#167;
	2-206 should apply, <i>Sherkate Sahami Khass Rapol v. Henry R. Jahn
	&amp; Son, Inc.</I>, 531 F. Supp. 1048, 1054-1055 (S.D. N.Y. 1982),
	rev'd on other grounds, 701 F.2d 1049 (2d Cir. 1983), but the case
	does not bolster its argument. <i>Sherkate</i> only reiterates the
	language of the U.C.C. as it applies to shipments of goods and does
	not suggest that these provisions should apply to the inspection of
	contractual terms.
	 
	<P>
	<h4>b. Sections 2-207 and 2-209</h4>

	<P>
	   The application of sections 2-207 and 2-209,
	Wis. Stat. &#167;&#167; 402.207 and 402.209, is best analyzed by
	examining <i>Step-Saver Data Sys., Inc.</i>, 939 F.2d 91, and
	<i>Arizona Retail Sys., Inc.</i>, 831 F. Supp. 759, the two leading
	cases on the enforceability of shrinkwrap licenses. Neither case
	involved the type of transaction between a computer user and a
	software producer that took place in this case when defendants
	purchased mass market software at a retail outlet.  Nonetheless, in
	both cases, the courts reached the conclusion that the shrinkwrap
	licenses at issue should be invalidated. The cases provide insight
	into the application of the U.C.C. to the Select Phone TM user
	agreement.

	<P>
	   The facts of <i>Step-Saver</i> and <i>Arizona Retail</i> are quite
	similar. Each case involved a series of transactions between retail
	computer stores and a software company named <i>The Software Link,
	Inc.</i> In <i>Step-Saver</i>, 939 F.2d 91, the retail store
	telephoned The Software Link and offered to purchase a specific
	software program. The Software Link accepted the offers over the
	telephone and agreed to ship copies of the program. During these
	discussions, The Software Link never mentioned any additional terms of
	the sales contract beyond the agreement to ship the software in
	exchange for monetary consideration.  <i>Id.</i> at 96. However, when the
	software packages arrived they were wrapped in shrinkwrap plastic upon
	which was affixed a box-top license setting out a number of terms
	purporting to disclaim warranties and limit remedies. Problems arose
	with the program and Step-Saver sued to recover damages.

	<P>
	   The factual background of <i>Arizona Retail</i>, 831 F. Supp. 759,
	differs only in the initial transaction between the retail store,
	Arizona Retail, and The Software Link. After Arizona Retail first
	telephoned to inquire about a specific software program, The Software
	Link sent two copies of the software, an evaluative copy and a "live"
	copy. Arizona Retail spent two hours using the evaluative copy,
	determined it wanted to purchase the program, and then opened the live
	copy upon which was attached the box-top license. <i>Id.</i> at 761.
	Subsequently, Arizona Retail purchased additional copies of the
	software through telephone transactions virtually identical to those
	in <i>Step Saver</i>. The court considered the initial transaction
	separately from the subsequent transactions, explaining that the
	initial offer took place when The Software Link sent a live copy of
	the software with the evaluation diskette. <i>Id.</i> at 764.  The live copy
	was sealed in an envelope upon which was added the statement that a
	user acknowledges "acceptance of this product, and [consents] to all
	the provisions [of] the Limited Use License Agreement" by opening the
	envelope. The court held that Arizona Retail had accepted The Software
	Link's offer and a contract was formed when it opened the
	envelope. <i>Id.</i> The terms of the box-top license were incorporated into
	that contract because they were visible on the outside of the envelope
	and Arizona Retail had been exposed to them before the contract was
	formed. <i>Id.</i> at 763.
	<P>
	   The court distinguished this situation from the subsequent
	transactions in that case and from the transactions in
	<i>Step-Saver</i>, 939 F.2d 91, in all of which a contract was formed
	and complete at the moment the parties agreed to order and ship
	goods. In the subsequent transactions, the agreement was formed before
	Arizona Retail became aware of The Software Link's insistence on the
	terms of the box-top license and thus those terms could not be
	considered part of the initial offer. 831 F. Supp. at 763-66. Even
	though Arizona Retail knew that The Software Link had imposed box-top
	license provisions in the first sale, the court held that the store
	did not know that The Software Link would impose box-top license
	provisions when it placed subsequent orders because The Software Link
	did not mention any such terms in the parties' telephone
	conversations. <i>Id.</i>  at 764. The court's holding accorded with the
	holding of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in
	<i>Step-Saver</i>, 939 F.2d at 105-06, that the box-top license terms
	could not be considered part of The Software Link's initial offer
	because Step-Saver was not apprised of those terms before the
	agreement to order and ship software.

	<P>
	   Because the box-top licenses were not part of the agreements to
	order and ship software, both the <i>Arizona Retail</i> and
	<i>Step-Saver</i> courts considered other methods of analyzing the
	application of the licenses' terms to the parties' contracts. In
	<i>Step-Saver</i>, the court analyzed the terms under &#167; 2-207,
	<i>id.</i> at 98 in <i>Arizona Retail</i>, 831 F. Supp. 759, the court
	determined that &#167; 2-209 was a better fit. <i>Id.</i>  at 765.

	<P>
	   <i>Step-Saver</i> and <i>Arizona Retail</i> suggest two
	possibilities for analyzing the alleged contract between plaintiff and
	defendants. One view is that the terms of the user agreement were
	incorporated into plaintiff's sales offer by the reference on the
	outside of the Select Phone TM package. If this is the case, then
	defendants are bound to the terms of the agreement because they opened
	and used the product, just as Arizona Retail was bound initially to
	the terms of The Software Link's box-top license. The other view is
	that the user agreement was not included in plaintiff's sales offer
	and represents either a proposed modification to the sales agreement
	under &#167; 2-209 or a written confirmation of a previously
	established contract under &#167; 2-207. Section 2-207 governs
	situations in which parties have reached a general agreement but have
	yet to agree on specific terms desired by one of the
	parties. <i>Arizona Retail</i>, 831 F. Supp. at 763. Section 2-209
	controls the modification of contracts after their formation.  <i>Id.</i>

	<P>
	    In <i>Arizona Retail</i>, 831 F. Supp. 759, the court considered
	the terms of the box-top license binding on Arizona Retail in the
	initial transaction because those terms were visible to Arizona Retail
	before it opened the software envelope. It is evident from the court's
	citation to <i>McCrimmon v. Tandy Corporation</i>, 202 Ga. App. 233,
	414 S.E.2d 15, in which a purchaser was held to a warranty disclaimer
	he had the opportunity to read before making his purchase, that the
	court believed that the terms must be made apparent before contract
	formation. 831 F. Supp. at 764, 765 n.3 (warranty disclaimers in
	<i>McCrimmon</i> made apparent to buyer at time of acceptance rather
	than afterwards). In <i>Step-Saver</i>, 939 F.2d 91, the court
	acknowledged the importance of exposure to specific terms when it
	noted the "well-established distinction between conspicuous
	disclaimers made available before the contract is formed and
	disclaimers made available only after the contract is formed." <i>Id.</i> at
	104-105, n. 45.
	<P>
	   The terms of the Select Phone TM user agreement were not presented
	to defendants at the time of sale. The sole reference to the user
	agreement was a disclosure in small print at the bottom of the
	package, stating that defendants were subject to the terms and
	conditions of the enclosed license agreement.  Defendants did not
	receive the Opportunity to inspect or consider those terms. Mere
	reference to the terms at the time of initial contract formation does
	not present buyers an adequate opportunity to decide whether they are
	acceptable. They must be able to read and consider the terms in their
	entirety.  The potential incorporation of the terms can occur only
	after the purchaser opens the package and has a reasonable opportunity
	to inspect the user agreement. Sections 2-207 or 2-209 control that
	incorporation.

	<P>
	   Plaintiff argues that even if the user agreement was not
	incorporated into its initial sales offer, defendants should have
	known about the user agreement after the initial purchase and should
	be subject to its terms in subsequent purchases. In <i>Step-Saver</i>,
	939 F.2d at 104, the court rejected this argument, recognizing that
	exposure to proposed terms in previous transactions did not change the
	fact that these terms were not agreed to at the time of subsequent
	contract formations. The court explained that it would be unjust to
	allow a seller that failed in its attempt to incorporate certain terms
	into an initial contract to hold the buyer to the same terms in
	subsequent transactions without first receiving the buyer's express
	assent. The court held that it was reasonable for Step-Saver to
	believe from The Software Link's shipment of software without any
	mention of terms that the manufacturer had agreed to do business
	without the box-top license terms. <i>Id.</i> Surprisingly, in <i>Arizona
	Retail</i>, 831 F. Supp. 759, the court did not confront the
	significance of Arizona Retail's knowledge of the box-top license
	terms as applied to the subsequent software transactions although it
	had drawn a distinction between the initial and subsequent
	transactions. Nonetheless, the court's opinion makes apparent its
	belief that express assent is required to terms that are not
	specifically made part of an agreement. <i>Id.</i> at 766.

	<P>
	   The decision on this issue is a dose call. Defendants may have
	known the exact terms of the user agreement at the time of their
	second and third purchases of Select Phone TM. In that case, I would
	not find it inherently "unjust," as did the court in
	<i>Step-Saver</i>, to hold a party to the terms a seller incorporates
	into a standard form contract. However, I would agree with that court
	that it is unwise to hold a buyer to those terms when software
	companies are free to change the terms of their shrinkwrap licenses
	between initial and later versions of their products. Like any other
	parties to a contract, computer users should be given the opportunity
	to review the terms to which they will be bound each and every time
	they contract. Although not all users will read the terms anew each
	time under such circumstances, it does not follow that they should not
	be given this opportunity. Defendants cannot be held to the user
	agreement included with the second and third copies of Select Phone TM
	they purchased merely because they were aware of the terms included
	with the initial version. Each software purchase creates a new
	contract. Computer users should be given a fresh opportunity to review
	any terms to which those contracts will bind them.

	<P>
	   It is unnecessary to consider in detail the distinctions between
	&#167;&#167; 2-207 and 2-209 because the terms of the user agreement
	are not binding on defendants regardless which section is applied. See
	<i>Arizona Retail</i>, 831 F. Supp. at 766 (Arizona Retail not bound
	by license agreement under either &#167; 2-207 or &#167; 2-209). The
	court determined that the license agreement was best seen as a
	proposed modification of the parties' sales contract under &#167;
	2-209 and ruled that the terms of that agreement were not effective
	because Arizona Retail had never assented to them. <i>Id.</i> at 765. Section
	2-209 requires the express assent of a party to any proposed
	contractual modifications. Assent cannot be inferred from a party's
	conduct in continuing with an agreement. <i>Id.</i>  at 759;
	<i>Step-Saver</i>, 939 F.2d at 98-99. In this case, defendants did not
	assent expressly to the terms of the user agreement. Their continued
	use of the Select Phone TM product has no bearing on whether they
	accepted the user agreement.  Under these circumstances, &#167; 2-209
	does not warrant the incorporation of the user agreement into the
	parties' initial sales agreement.

	<P>
	   In <i>Step-Saver</i>, 939 F.2d 91, the court discussed at length
	the application of &#167; 2-207 to the software transactions between
	Step-Saver and The Software Link, noting that &#167; 2-207 was
	intended to end a "battle of forms" between merchants that took place
	under common law because a party was bound to the terms of the last
	sent form if it proceeded to perform the contract after receiving that
	form. <i>Id.</i> at 99. Under &#167; 2-207(2), the terms proposed in such
	forms are to be considered proposals for addition to the contract.
	These terms become binding on merchants unless certain important
	conditions are met. Section 2-207 is silent on how additional terms
	should be construed in a transaction between a merchant and a
	consumer. Keeping in mind the legislative goal behind &#167; 2-207, it
	is improbable to think that the drafters wanted consumers to be held
	to additional proposed terms in situations in which merchants were
	given protection. Because &#167; 2-207 is concerned primarily with
	contract wars between merchants, it is preferable to analyze the
	Select Phone TM user agreement under &#167; 2-209. Nonetheless,
	applying &#167; 2-207 to the consumer transaction in this case still
	leads to the conclusion that the user agreement was not binding on
	defendants because they never agreed to it expressly and it never
	became part of the agreement between the parties.

	<P>
	   I conclude that because defendants did not have the opportunity to
	bargain or object to the proposed user agreement or even review it
	before purchase and they did not assent to the terms explicitly after
	they learned of them, they are not bound by the user agreement.
	 
	<P>
	<h4>c. Draft section 2-2203</h4>

	<P>
	   The American Law Institute, drafters of proposed new
	U.C.C. provisions,
	   has suggested a provision, &#167; 2-2203, that would make standard form
	licenses enforceable if:
	 
	<blockquote>
	<P>
	(a) . . . prior to or within a reasonable time after beginning to use
	the intangible pursuant to an agreement, the party
	 
	<P>
	(1) signs or otherwise by its behavior manifests assent to a standard
	form license; and
	 
	<P>
	(2) had an opportunity to review the terms of the license before
	manifesting assent, whether or not it actually reviewed the terms.
	 </blockquote>
	</p>
	<P>
	Lemley, <i>supra</i>, 68 S. Cal. L. Rev. at 1293. This proposal is evidence
	that the American Law Institute views current law as insufficient to
	guarantee the enforcement of standard form contracts such as
	shrinkwrap licenses. The draft provision appears to introduce a &#167;
	2-206 type of inspection, rejection and revocation element into
	shrinkwrap contracts and thereby place significant responsibility on
	buyers to actively reject those terms by returning the goods if they
	find the terms unacceptable. Louisiana and Illinois enacted similar
	legislative schemes in the 1980s but they are no longer in
	effect. David A.  Rice, <i>Public Goods, Private Contract and Public
	Policy: Federal Preemption of Software License Prohibitions Against
	Reverse Engineering</i>, 53 U.  Pitt. L. Rev. 543, 565 (1992). The
	Louisiana statute was partially invalidated by the Court of Appeals
	for the Fifth Circuit on federal preemption grounds, <i>Vault
	Corp.</i>, 847 F.2d at 270, and Illinois repealed its law. <i>Id.</i> If the
	draft provision gains substantial acceptance among the states, the
	application of the U.C.C. to shrinkwrap licenses may no longer require
	detailed consideration. In that event, federal preemption concerns
	will become even more prominent. I turn next to that issue.

	<P>
	   <h2>C. Preemption of State Law Claims</h2>

	<P>
	   Section 301 governs preemption of state law claims that conflict
	with the federal copyright policies embedded in the federal Copyright
	Act. 17 U.S.C. &#167; 301. It comes into play only if both of two
	conditions are satisfied: 1) the work in which the state law right is
	asserted comes within the "subject matter" of copyright, as specified
	in 17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 102 or 103; and 2) the state law right
	asserted is equivalent to any of the rights specified in 17
	U.S.C. &#167; 106.  <i>Baltimore Orioles v. Major League Baseball
	Players</i>, 805 F.2d 663, 674 (7th Cir.  1986).
	 
	<p>
	  <h3> 1. Subject matter of copyright</h3>

	<P>
	   Plaintiff begins with the proposition that if defendants are
	correct in arguing that the Select Phone TM data compilation cannot be
	copyrighted, it follows as a matter of course that the data are
	outside the subject matter of the federal copyright law. The line is
	not so clear as plaintiff would draw it.  Section 102 of the Copyright
	Act, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102, extends copyright protection to original
	works of authorship including literary, musical, dramatic and a number
	of other types of works. Factual compilations are included within the
	subject matter of copyright by 17 U.S.C. &#167; 103 and are defined
	elsewhere in the act as a collection of data or materials arranged in
	such a way as to constitute an original work of authorship. 17
	U.S.C. &#167; 101.

	<P>
	   The law in this circuit is that the "subject matter of copyright"
	includes works that fit within the general subject matter of
	&#167;&#167; 102 and 103, whether or not the works qualify for actual
	protection. See <i>Baltimore Orioles v. Major League Baseball
	Players</i>. 805 F.2d 663. The question in the <i>Baltimore
	Orioles</i> case was whether major league baseball clubs owned
	exclusive rights to the televised performances of the players during
	major league baseball games. <i>Id.</i> at 665. The players argued that they
	had a state law right of publicity in their performances; the clubs
	contended that federal copyright law preempted this state law
	right. The court rejected the players' argument that because their
	performances lacked sufficient creativity and were not copyrightable,
	they fell outside the subject matter of copyright. In concluding that
	a work can fall within the subject matter of copyright even if it
	lacks any creativity or originality, the court relied on a House of
	Representatives report: "As long as a work fits within one of the
	general subject matter categories of section 102 and
	103,. . . [section 301(a)] prevents the States from protecting it even
	if it fails to achieve Federal copyright because it is too minimal or
	lacking in originality to qualify." <i>Id.</i> at 676 (citing
	H.R.Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 51 (1976), reprinted in 1976
	U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5747).

	<P>
	   Other courts have ruled similarly. See <i>Harper &amp; Row
	Publishers, Inc. v.  Nation Enterprises</i>, 723 F.2d 195, 201 (2d
	Cir. 1983), <i>rev'd on other grounds</i>, 471 U.S. 539, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588,
	105 S. Ct. 2218 (1985) (accepting opposite position would allow states
	to "expand the perimeters of copyright protection to their own liking"
	and would "run directly afoul of one of the Copyright Act's central
	purposes, to 'avoid the development of any vague borderline areas
	between State and Federal protection.'" (citing H.R. Rep. No.  1476,
	1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5746)); <i>Ehat v. Tanner</i>, 780 F.2d 876, 877
	(10th Cir.  1985), <i>cert. denied</i> 479 U.S. 820, 93 L. Ed. 2d 39, 107
	S. Ct. 86 (1986) (Congress stated expressly that &#167; 301 is
	intended to prevent "the States from protecting . . . [a work] even if
	it fails to achieve Federal statutory copyright because it is too
	minimal or lacking in originality to qualify") (citing
	H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5747). See also <i>Nash
	v. CBS, Inc.</i>, 704 F. Supp. 823, 832 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (state law
	claims do not avoid preemption simply because they are based upon
	improper use of uncopyrightable material contained in works properly
	subject to copyright).

	<P>
	    The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit touched on this issue
	in <i>United States Trotting Ass'n v. Chicago Downs Ass'n, Inc.</i>,
	665 F.2d 781 (7th Cir.  1981). The court held that a misappropriation
	claim was not preempted because it did not fall within the realm of
	federal copyright law. <i>Id.</i> at 786 n.6.  Although the Court of Appeals
	for the Seventh Circuit did not mention <i>United States Trotting
	Ass'n</i> in <i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, its decision in the latter case
	seems to overrule any suggestion in <i>United States Trotting
	Ass'n</i> that uncopyrightable material cannot fall within the subject
	matter of copyright law.

	<P>
	   In <i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, 805 F.2d 663, the court muted the full
	impact of its holding by noting that regardless of the originality of
	the players' performances, the recordings of the games were original
	enough to come within the scope of copyright law because of the
	creative contributions of the announcers. <i>Id.</i> at 676. Plaintiff would
	like this court to believe that by hedging its decision in this
	manner, the court left open the question whether uncopyrightable
	material can fall within the subject matter of copyright. Its argument
	is unpersuasive in light of the court's reliance on explicit
	congressional intent and the holdings of the other circuits.

	<P>
	   Plaintiff notes that the Nimmer treatise criticizes the court's
	holding in <i>Baltimore Orioles</i> on this issue, proposing that it
	was confused over which works fall within the subject matter of
	copyright. David Nimmer &amp; Melville B.  Nimmer, Nimmer on
	Copyright, &#167; 1.01[B] at 1-24, n.101 (1995). The Nimmers' views
	notwithstanding, <i>Baltimore Orioles</i> is still good case law in
	this circuit and I am bound to apply it.

	<P>
	   The telephone listings on the Select Phone TM CD-ROM discs are a
	compilation of facts that would qualify for copyright protection under
	&#167; 103 if they were sufficiently original; that they lack the
	necessary originality does not affect their status as coming within
	the subject matter of copyright. Baltimore Orioles compels the
	conclusion that plaintiff's uncopyrightable compilation of telephone
	data satisfies the first prong of the preemption test.
	 
	<P>
	<h3>2. Equivalency of asserted rights to rights specified in &#167;
	106</h3>

	<P>
	   A right is equivalent to one of the rights set forth in &#167; 106
	if it "is infringed by the mere act of reproduction, performance,
	distribution or display." <i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, 805 F.2d at 677
	(citing Nimmer, <i>supra</i>, &#167; 1.01[B][1]). To avoid preemption, a
	cause of action defined by state law must incorporate an "extra
	element" beyond those necessary to prove copyright
	infringement. <i>Trandes Corp. v. Guy F. Atkinson Co.</i>, 996 F.2d
	655, 659 (4th Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i>, 126 L. Ed. 2d 377, 114 S. Ct. 443
	(1993). Section 106 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 106, grants
	the owner of a copyright exclusive rights of reproduction and
	distribution. The causes of action on which plaintiff's state law
	claims are based are designed to protect these same reproduction and
	distribution rights. As such, plaintiff's asserted state law rights
	are equivalent to rights provided by &#167; 106 and its state law
	claims are preempted under &#167; 301.
	 
	<p>
	  <h4> a. Contract claim</h4>

	<P>
	   Several federal courts have held that breach of contract claims are
	not preempted by &#167; 301 of the Copyright Act because breach of
	contract is not a cause of action "equivalent" to a copyright
	infringement claim. <i>National Car Rental Sys., Inc. v. Computer
	Associates Int'l Inc.</i>, 991 F.2d 426, 433 (8th Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i>,
	126 L. Ed. 2d 136, 114 S. Ct. 176 (1993); <i>Taquino v.  Teledyne
	Monarch Rubber</i>, 893 F.2d 1488, 1501 (5th Cir. 1990); <i>Acorn
	Structures, Inc. v. Swantz</i>, 846 F.2d 923, 926 (4th Cir. 1988);
	<i>Trenton v. Infinity Broadcasting Corp.</i>, 865 F. Supp. 1416, 1429
	(C.D. Cal. 1994). Plaintiff argues that the contractual restriction
	imposed in its user agreement established an "extra element" that
	makes its breach of contract claim different from its copyright
	infringement claim but, in reality, its breach of contract claim is
	nothing more than an effort to prevent defendants from copying and
	distributing its data, exactly what it sought to bar defendants from
	doing under copyright law. See <i>Ehat</i>, 780 F.2d at 878. The
	"extra element" test used to determine whether a state law right is
	equivalent to a right protected by copyright law requires more than
	the mere existence of an extra element in the state law claim. It
	requires an extra element that makes the state law claim qualitatively
	different from the underlying copyright claim. See <i>Data General
	Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp.</i>, 36 F.3d 1147, 1164 (1st
	Car. 1994) ("Not every 'extra element' of a state claim will establish
	a qualitative variance between the rights protected by federal
	copyright law and those protected by state law"); <i>Harper &amp; Row
	Publishers</i>, 723 F.2d at 201 (additional elements did not establish
	a fundamental nonequivalence between state and federal rights
	implicated); Rice, <i>supra</i>, 53 U. Pitt. L. Rev. at 616 (Section 301
	concerned with effects, not form).

	<P>
	   Each of the breach of contract cases plaintiff cites involved the
	assertion of rights significantly different from the reproduction and
	distribution rights protected under copyright law. In <i>National Car
	Rental</i>, 991 F.2d 426, the plaintiff licensed the defendant to use
	its software for internal operations and for the processing of the
	defendant's data. When the defendant used the software to process the
	data of a third party, the plaintiff sued, contending that the
	defendant used the software in a manner outside the bounds of the
	contract. <i>Id.</i>  at 428. The court found that the agreement created a
	right that did not exist under copyright law, an "extra element" that
	made the breach of contract claim qualitatively different from a
	copyright infringement claim. <i>Id.</i> at 433. The plaintiff did not claim
	that the defendant had improperly reproduced, distributed or displayed
	the software, all of which would be claims that would have to brought
	under federal copyright law. <i>Taquino</i>, 893 F.2d 1488, and
	<i>Trenton</i>, 865 F. Supp. 1416, contain reasoning similar to that
	in <i>National Car Rental</i>. In <i>Taquino</i>, the court held that
	the provisions in a covenant not to compete were valid and that the
	rights the plaintiff sought to protect by enforcing the contract were
	sufficiently distinct from reproduction and distribution rights as not
	to be preempted by the federal Copyright Act. 893 F.2d at 1501. In
	<i>Trenton</i>, the court found a breach of contract claim not
	preempted by federal copyright law because "the contract-based causes
	of action do allege more than the unauthorized use of a copyrighted
	work. They also claim that there has been a breach of an underlying
	contract. . ." <i>Trenton</i>, 865 F.  Supp. at 1429. The court did
	not elaborate further on its reasoning. In <i>Acorn</i>, 846 F.2d 923,
	a Suit brought by an architect against a prospective customer who used
	the architect's plans to build his house without fulfilling his
	obligation to pay for them, the court viewed the architect's contract
	claim as a separate and distinct cause of action that did not arise
	out of the subject matter of copyright. <i>Id.</i> at 926.

	<P>
	   To the extent that <i>National Car Rental, Taquino, Trenton</i> and
	<i>Acorn</i> support the proposition that a copyright infringement
	claim is not equivalent to a contract claim merely because the
	contract claim requires a plaintiff to show the additional element of
	breach, I disagree respectfully with their conclusions. Contracts that
	seek to protect reproduction and distribution rights step into
	territory already covered by copyright law. It would alter the
	"delicate balance" of copyright law to allow parties to avoid
	copyright law by contracting around it.

	<P>
	   <i>National Car Rental, Taquino, Trenton,</i> and <i>Acorn</i> do
	show that contract claims are not preempted automatically by federal
	copyright law. Contracts that are consistent with the copyright law's
	goals of self-protection should be upheld.  Rightful owners should be
	able to define the limits of permissible copying or modification of
	their works. Thomas Lee Hazen, <i>Contract Principles as a Guide for
	Protecting Intellectual Property Rights in Computer Software: The
	Limits of Copyright Protection, the Evolving Concept of Derivative
	Works, and the Proper Limits of Licensing Arrangements</i>, 20
	U.C. Davis. L. Rev. 105, 142 (1986). It is only when a contract erects
	a barrier on access to information that under copyright law should be
	accessible that &#167; 301 Operates to protect copyright law from
	individually crafted evasions of that law. See Rice, <i>supra</i>, 53 U.
	Pitt. L. Rev. at 614 ("The far-reaching public policy Section 301
	implements clearly requires preemption of contract-based protection of
	expression as expression where the effect is to secure rights in that
	expression which are greater than, equal to, or supplemental of those
	which Section 106 secures); Hazen, <i>supra</i>, 20 U.C. Davis L. Rev. at 129
	("Courts should invalidate contracts attempting to expand the
	intellectual property's protection too far beyond the parameters of
	copyright law on the grounds of statutory preemption, or as against
	public policy"); Christopher Celentino et al., <i>Vault Corp. v. Quaid
	Software Ltd.: Invalidating Shrink-Wrap Licenses?</i>, 2 J.L. &amp;
	Tech. 151, 162 (1987) (<i>Vault</i> opinion has merit if it means that
	contracts providing rights greater than or equivalent to those under
	copyright law are preempted).

	<P>
	   Plaintiff's license agreement is an attempt to avoid the confines
	of copyright law and of <i>Feist</i>, 499 U.S. 340, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358,
	111 S. Ct. 1282.  Its prohibition on the distribution of public
	information cannot be squared with the purposes of copyright law or
	with plaintiff's own compilation of data.  Had each of the compilers
	of the 3,000 directories that plaintiff used to put together its
	database attached a set of terms prohibiting further distribution of
	the information included in its directories, plaintiff would not have
	been able to create Select Phone TM without negotiating with and
	compensating each compiler for use of its data. The Supreme Court's
	decision in <i>Feist</i> allowed plaintiff to avoid these problems and
	create its database without any fear of copyright infringement. It is
	ironic that after plaintiff has attained the benefits of copyright
	law, it wants to prevent others from receiving that same
	protection. Unfortunately for plaintiff, the rules of the game have
	not changed. Just as plaintiff had public access to the telephone
	listings, so do defendants. Plaintiff cannot use a standard form
	contract to make an end run around copyright law. Its contract claim
	is preempted by &#167; 301.
	 
	<P>
	<h4>b. Misappropriation claim</h4>

	<P>
	   I note first that plaintfff set forth an unfair competition claim
	in its complaint but did not develop the claim in its summary judgment
	briefs. Because of the close relationship between the torts of unfair
	competition and misappropriation, I will treat plaintiff's unfair
	competition claim as part and parcel of its misappropriation claim.

	<P>
	   At an early stage, the House of Representatives bill that
	eventually became &#167; 301 included misappropriation in a list of
	torts that were considered not equivalent to copyright
	infringement. <i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, 805 F.2d at 676-77 n.25. That
	list was deleted from the bill shortly before passage. As enacted, 301
	of the Copyright Act does not provide any explicit guidance on the
	preemption of misappropriation claims by copyright law. Plaintiff
	cites extensive language from the House Report detailing why
	misappropriation is not necessarily synonymous with copyright
	infringement:

	<blockquote>
	   ". . . [A] cause of action labeled as 'misappropriation' is not
	preempted if it is in fact based neither on a right within the general
	scope of copyright as specified by Section 106 nor on a right
	equivalent thereto. For example, state law should have the flexibility
	to afford a remedy (under traditional principles of equity) against a
	consistent pattern of unauthorized appropriation by a competitor of
	the facts (i.e., not the literary expression) constituting 'hot' news,
	whether in the traditional mold of International News
	Serv. v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215, 63 L. Ed. 211, 39 S. Ct. 68
	(1918), or in the newer form of updates from scientific, business or
	other financial databases.  Likewise, a person having no trust or
	other relationship with the proprietor of a computerized database
	should not be immunized from sanctions against electronically or
	cryptographically breaching the proprietor's security arrangements and
	accessing the proprietor's data . . ."</blockquote>
	 
	H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5748. I hesitate to place too
	much weight on these statements because the Court of Appeals for the
	Seventh Circuit has determined that the deletion of the list from the
	bill should be given little weight in determining whether a particular
	right is equivalent to copyright, stating, "almost any interpretation
	of the concept of equivalent rights can be inferred from the
	legislative history." <i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, 805 F.2d at 676-77
	n.25; see also Nimmer, <i>supra</i>, &#167; 1.01[B] at 1-30 (in view of
	ambiguous legislative history, it is best to ignore the significance
	of the earlier explicit mention and later deletion of the word
	"misappropriation").  In addition, the discussion of misappropriation
	in the House Report seems to run counter to the discussion elsewhere
	in the report that "in the clearest and most unequivocal language
	possible. . ." &#167; 301 is intended to "avoid the development of any
	vague borderline areas between State and Federal Protection."
	H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5746.

	<P>
	   The majority of federal courts addressing this issue have found
	misappropriation claims preempted. See Nimmer, <i>supra</i>, &#167; 1.01[B]
	at 1-35 n. 156 ("misappropriation is but another label for
	reproduction and as such, is a preempted right 'within the general
	scope of copyright' under Section 301(a)") (collecting approximately
	twenty appellate and district court cases holding misappropriation
	claims preempted); <i>Universal City Studios v. T-Shirt Gallery,
	Ltd.</i>, 634 F. Supp. 1468, 1476 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (New York's
	misappropriation tort preempted); <i>Mayer v. Josiah Wedgwood &amp; Sons,
	Ltd.</i>, 601 F. Supp. 1523, 1535 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (New York's
	misappropriation tort preempted); <i>Videotronics, Inc.  v. Bend
	Elecs.</i>, 564 F. Supp. 1471 (D. Nev. 1983) (where intellectual
	property subject to copyright law, applying state doctrine of
	misappropriation to protect it would create an unacceptable conflict
	with federal policy).

	<P>
	   Courts reaching the opposite conclusion have analyzed
	misappropriation claims different in nature from the one at hand and
	have looked more to the "extra element" that must be proven under the
	state law claims in finding that Congress did not intend to preempt
	the cause of action at issue. The cases plaintiff cites make this
	apparent. <i>Data General Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp.</i>, 36
	F.3d 1147; <i>Princess Fabrics, Inc. v. CHF, Inc.</i>, 922 F.2d 99 (2d
	Cir. 1990); <i>Wilson v. Mr. Tee's</i>, 855 F. Supp. 679
	(D. N.J. 1994); <i>CSM Investors Inc. v.  Everest Development,
	Ltd.</i>, 840 F. Supp. 1304 (D. Minn. 1994); <i>Rubin v.  Brooks/Cole
	Pub. Co.</i>, 836 F. Supp. 909 (D. Mass. 1993). None of these cases
	involved a misappropriation claim based solely on improper copying and
	distribution. Rather, the cases involved trade secrets claims
	requiring plaintiff to show a breach of confidentiality, <i>Data
	General</i>, 36 F.3d at 1165, or "palming off" claims necessitating a
	showing that the public is misled about the origin of the
	product. <i>Princess Fabrics</i>, 922 F.2d at 104 (misappropriation
	claim is preempted but states may still prohibit palming off); <i>Wilson</i>,
	855 F. Supp. at 684 (palming off claims not preempted); <i>CSM
	Investors</i>, 840 F. Supp. at 1314 (neither unfair competition
	involving palming off nor unjust enrichment claims involving illegal
	benefit from another are preempted); <i>Rubin</i>, 836 F.  Supp. at
	924 (extra elements of misrepresentation and deceit qualitatively
	different from reproduction).

	<P>
	   The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has not addressed the
	preemption issue as it relates to misappropriation claims, although it
	affirmed a district court holding to that effect. See <i>Nash v. CBS,
	Inc.</i>, 899 F.2d 1537 (7th Cir.  1990), <i>aff'g on other grounds</i> 704
	F. Supp. 823, 835 (N.D. Ill. 1989). In <i>Nash</i>, 704 F. Supp. at
	834, the district court noted that, "The goal underlying copyright law
	is the same as that driving the tort of misappropriation: balancing
	the need to provide economic incentives for authorship against the
	preservation of the freedom to imitate." However, the district court
	did not go so far as to hold that &#167; 301 always preempts the tort
	of misappropriation. It found that the statements in the House
	Judiciary Committee Report on the 1976 Amendments to the Copyright Act
	reflected a legislative intent to keep available certain
	misappropriation claims. <i>Id.</i>

	<p> The elements of the tort of misappropriation in Wisconsin are "(1)
	time, labor and money expended in the creation of the thing
	misappropriated; (2) competition; and (3) commercial damage to the
	plaintiff." <i>Mercury Record Productions, Inc., v. Economic
	Consultants, Inc.</i>, 64 Wis. 2d 163, 174, 218 N.W.2d 705, 709
	(1974), <i>cert. denied</i>, 420 U.S. 914, 43 L. Ed. 2d 386, 95 S. Ct.  1107
	(1975). At first blush, the second and third factors of the Mercury
	Record test appear to constitute extra elements that would exempt
	Wisconsin's misappropriation tort from preemption. However, as
	discussed above, the mere presence of extra elements does not indicate
	that the underlying right is not equivalent to rights protected under
	&#167; 106 of the Copyright Act. When the purposes of copyright and
	misappropriation law are compared with respect to plaintiff's claim,
	it is evident that misappropriation does not serve any qualitatively
	different purposes from copyright law. Copyright law seeks to
	encourage individuals to create new works by offering them the
	security that those works will be rewarded with a limited
	monopoly. <i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, 805 F.2d at 678.  Thus it protects
	authors from those who seek to usurp the copyright owner's creative
	efforts by copying. The tort of misappropriation offers the same type
	of protection. Adding competition and commercial damage does not
	differentiate the underlying protected right. In fact, these elements
	are subsumed in a party's decision to bring a copyright infringement
	claim.  Without some form of competition and commercial damage, a
	party would not have the financial incentive to sue for copyright
	infringement. I conclude that because plaintiff's misappropriation
	claim is not qualitatively different from a copyright infringement
	claim, the underlying rights plaintiff seeks to vindicate are
	equivalent to federal rights and are preempted by the Copyright Act.
	 
	<P>
	<h4>c. Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act claim</h4>

	<P>
	   The Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act makes it unlawful to modify,
	destroy, access, take, or copy computer data willfully, knowingly and
	without authorization. Wis. Stat. &#167; 943.70(2)(a). Under the
	statute, "data" are property and include representations of
	information, knowledge or facts prepared in formalized manners and
	intended to be processed in a computer system. Wis. Stat &#167;
	943.70(1)(f).  Under the act, the Select Phone TM telephone listings
	qualify as data and defendants' distribution of that data is made
	unlawful.

	<P>
	   Again, the question is whether federal copyright law preempts the
	statute as it applies to defendants' actions. Plaintiff points to a
	recent Wisconsin appellate court decision in which the court held that
	the law was not preempted by the Copyright Act. In <i>State
	v. Corcoran</i>, 186 Wis. 2d 616, 522 N.W.2d 226 (Ct.  App.), 
	<i>review denied</i>,
	527 N.W.2d 335 (1994), the Wisconsin Court of Appeals upheld a
	conviction under the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act of a computer
	software programmer who destroyed data stored on the computer of his
	former employer by inserting "booby traps into programs he had written
	for the employer. <i>Id.</i> at 620, 522 N.W.2d at 228. The court explained
	that it did not need to consider the defendant's argument that federal
	copyright law preempted the Wisconsin act because the data the
	defendant was accused of destroying could not be protected by
	copyright. <i>Id.</i> at 628, 522 N.W.2d at 231 ("Therefore, we need not
	decide if the federal Copyrights [<i>sic</i>] Act preempts the enforcement of
	the WCCA; Corcoran was properly convicted of destroying facts that
	cannot be protected by copyright"). The court said that "If [it] were
	to address the question of. . .preemption," it would apply the "extra
	element" test. <i>Id.</i> at 628 n.11, 522 N.W.2d at 231 n11.
	<P>
	   Plaintiff argues that the court reached its holding in
	<i>Corcoran</i> because the destroyed data were not copyrightable and
	therefore did not meet the first requirement of the preemption test,
	that the material fall within the subject matter of copyright. This is
	a reasonable interpretation of the court's holding, but not the only
	one. The court of appeals did not hold explicitly that such data does
	not "fall within the subject matter of copyright["] for purposes of
	preemption analysis. In fact, the court's footnote seems to indicate
	that the court's understanding of the preemption test focused solely
	on the second, or "extra element prong["] of the analysis. See 186
	Wis. 2d at 628 n.11, 522 N.W.2d at 231 n.11 ("The analysis applied by
	the federal courts requires a determination if the state-created cause
	of action contains an 'extra element' in addition to the acts of
	reproduction or distribution"). The court's discussion of the issue
	lacks specific mention of the subject matter test. As seen in
	<i>Baltimore Orioles</i>, 805 F.2d 663, an inquiry into the subject
	matter of copyright requires more than just determining whether given
	material is a proper recipient of copyright protection. It is unlikely
	that the court's single sentence mention of subject matter in Corcoran
	was meant to foreclose future application of a more comprehensive
	subject matter test.

	<P>
	   Applying the preemption test to plaintiff's claim that defendants
	violated the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act, it becomes evident that
	the claim should be preempted for the same reasons as plaintiff's
	breach of contract and misappropriation claims. The first prong is
	satisfied because the telephone listings fall within the subject
	matter of copyright and the second is met because plaintiff seeks
	merely to prohibit the copying and distribution that it could not
	prevent under federal copyright law. In reaching this conclusion that
	federal law preempts plaintiff's claim under the Wisconsin Computer
	Crimes Act, I do not hold or intend to imply that the Wisconsin
	Computer Crimes Act is preempted in all instances. Preemption would
	not occur in a Corcoran-like situation when an individual destroys
	another's data purposefully. In those situations, the right sought to
	be enforced differs greatly from the copying and distribution rights
	covered by copyright law. What this conclusion does mean is that
	plaintiff cannot succeed on its underlying copyright claim by dressing
	it in other clothing. Plaintiff's efforts to establish a right under
	the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act conflicts directly with the federal
	copyright law's directive to keep unoriginal factual compilations in
	the public domain. It would undermine the public access to facts and
	ideas if states could block such access with their own legislation.


	<P>
	   IT IS ORDERED that the motion for summary judgment of defendants
	Matthew Zeidenberg and Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc., is GRANTED
	and that the motion for summary judgment of plaintiff ProCD, Inc. is
	DENIED. FURTHER, IT IS ORDERED that the preliminary injunction entered
	herein on September 22, 1995, is DISSOLVED. This order does not affect
	the permanent injunction entered against Ivory Tower Information
	Systems, Inc., pursuant to a settlement agreement on October 19,
	1995. The clerk of court is directed to enter judgment for defendants
	Matthew Zeidenberg and Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc., and close
	this case.

 <h1><strong>Soffer  v.  Beech</strong></h1>

                         Supreme Court of Pennsylvania<br>
                           487 Pa. 255, 409 A.2d 337<br>
				1979

<p>
Before Eagen, C. J., and O'Brien, Roberts, Nix,
Manderino, Larsen, and Flaherty, JJ.  


<p>Roberts, Justice

<p>   At common law a lessee who had never entered into possession of his
leasehold was prohibited from bringing an action in ejectment to gain
possession.  The issue before us is the continued validity of this
rule.  We are satisfied by considerations of reason and fairness and
by the weight of modern case law that the ancient rule now serves no
useful purpose, and, accordingly, we refuse to permit its continued
use.

<p><center>
I
 </center>  

<p>   On August 15, 1951, George and Mary Beech leased property they owned in
Allegheny County to appellee Sun Oil Company for a term of fifteen years with
two additional five-year options.  The lease was recorded.  In 1956 George and
Mary Beech conveyed the property to appellee James Beech.  The lease to Sun Oil
was not affected.

<p>   On September 17, 1962, appellee James Beech and his wife leased the
same property to appellants Joseph and Violet Soffer for a fifty-year
term.<a name="F1_1"><a href="#FN1_1"><sup><fontsize=-2>1</font></sup></a></a>  This lease specifically recited that it was
``subject to'' the prior lease to Sun Oil.  <a name="F1_2"><a href="#FN1_2"><sup><fontsize=-2>2</font></sup></a></a> This lease was also recorded.
 

<p>      In July of 1974, as Sun Oil's term was approaching an end, James
Beech and Sun Oil executed what they styled an ``amendment and
ratification'' to the original 1951 lease.  This ``amendment and
ratification'' would allow Sun Oil, at its option, to remain in
possession until at least 1997.<a name="F1_3"><a href="#FN1_3"><sup><fontsize=-2>3</font></sup></a></a>

<p>   In March of 1976, the Soffers sent written notice to Sun Oil of
their intention to take possession on October 1, 1976, the expiration
date of Sun Oil's original fifteen year lease plus the original
options.  Sun Oil replied that it would remain in possession under the
provisions of the 1974 ``amendment and ratification.''

<p>   The Soffers then filed this ejectment action against Sun Oil and
James Beech in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County.  The
complaint asserted that the ``amendment and ratification'' constituted
a cancellation of the existing 1951 lease and that the Soffers were
entitled to possession of the property and damages of $ 240 a month
from January 1, 1975, the effective date of cancellation.

<p>   Sun Oil responded by raising a single preliminary objection, which
is the subject of this appeal.<a name="F1_4"><a href="#FN1_4"><sup><fontsize=-2>4</font></sup></a></a> Sun Oil asserted
that the Soffers' complaint failed to state a cause of action in
ejectment because it did not allege that the Soffers had ever entered
into possession of the property and were thereafter ousted.  Sun Oil
claimed that the complaint could not be amended to include such an
allegation and, therefore, that the complaint should be dismissed
without leave to amend.  The trial court sustained Sun Oil's objection
and dismissed the complaint.  On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed
without opinion.  This Court then granted allowance of appeal.
 
<center>
   II
</center>

<p>   It has never been doubted that a tenant who has been in possession
of his leasehold but who is subsequently ousted may bring an action in
ejectment to regain possession for the duration of his term.  He may
do so whether the wrongful possessor is his landlord or a third party.
13 Stnd.Pa.Prac. Ch. 67, &#167; 35 (1957).  Indeed, ejectment was
originally developed as a remedy for tenants wrongfully dispossessed
of their estates.  <em>Dice</em> v. <em>Reese,</em> 342 Pa. 379, 385, 21
A.2d 89, 92 (1941); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries * 199.  We are
faced today only with the question of whether a lessee who has never
been in possession but who is entitled to immediate possession, should
be permitted the same remedy.<a name="F1_5"><a href="#FN1_5"><sup><fontsize=-2>5</font></sup></a></a>
 

<p>   The common law originally denied ejectment to the lessee who had
never been in possession.  And a handful of cases in this
Commonwealth, most of them now musty with age, have acknowledged this
restriction.  The trial court, in dismissing the Soffers' complaint,
relied on the two most recent of these cases, <em>Barnsdall</em> v.
<em>Bradford Gas Co.</em>, 225 Pa. 338, 74 A. 207 (1909) and <em>Dime Bank
and Trust Company of Pittston</em> v. <em>Walsh</em>, 143 Pa.Super. 189, 17
A.2d 728 (1940). In Barnsdall this Court noted the existence of the
rule that a lessee could not maintain ejectment prior to entry.
Barnsdall, however, distinguished the rule and upheld an ejectment
action by a lessee of mineral rights who had never entered into
possession.

<p>   In <em>Dime Bank</em> the Superior Court followed the rule and
elaborated on its history:
<blockquote>
    ``The court below . . . held, and in our opinion correctly,
that as plaintiff had only a leasehold interest in the lot of land,
and had never entered into possession, it could not bring ejectment to
obtain possession.  The history of the action of ejectment given in
Blackstone's Commentaries (Book III, pp. 199-206) shows that a tenant
for years must have been in possession under his lease and been ousted
before he can bring ejectment.  In fact, a lessee did not become a
tenant for years, until after he entered `by force of the lease':
Littleton's Tenures (Edited by Wambaugh), Book I, chap. VII, p. 26.''
</blockquote> 
143 Pa.Super. at 195, 17 A.2d at 731 (emphasis in original).  We do
not question the Superior Court's recitation of the early history of
the rule.  But the mere recitation of the rule's history does not
explain its present use nor does it justify its continued application.
Indeed, a review of the historical development of the action of
ejectment indicates that the common law rule requiring prior entry by
a lessee is inconsistent with the modern scope of the writ and with
our modern conception of landlord and tenant relations.

<p><center>
   III
</center>

<p>   The legal action of ejectment began not as a real property action,
but as an action in trespass.  <em>Seitzinger</em> v. <em>Ridgway</em>, 9
Watts 496 (1840). Ejectment originally rested on a claim of actual or
constructive ouster of the plaintiff.  13 Stnd.Pa.Prac. Ch. 67, &#167; 1
(1957).  Entry by the lessee and subsequent ouster by the defendant
were essential to the claim of trespass.

<p>   The writ of ejectment, however, has changed dramatically in the
centuries since its narrow origin.  Today, the right to possession is
the central element of the action---not the claim of ouster.  The writ
of ejectment has long been the general method for obtaining possession
of real property.  <em>Dice</em> v. <em>Reese</em>, 342 Pa. 379, 384-86,
21 A.2d 89, 92-93 (1941); <em>Irwin</em> v. <em>Hoffman</em>, 319 Pa. 8,
16-17, 179 A. 41, 45 (1935). The writ has expanded from a tenant's
remedy and has long since been available to fee claimants and all
others who assert the right to possession of estates in real property.
See <em>Gilberton Coal Co.</em> v. <em>Schuster</em>, 403 Pa. 226, 228,
169 A.2d 44, 45 (1961).<a name="F1_6"><a href="#FN1_6"><sup><fontsize=-2>6</font></sup></a></a> Yet it has
never been suggested that a fee claimant need allege entry and ouster
in order to succeed in ejectment.  Rather, our cases involving fee
claimants speak only of the right to possession by one not presently
in possession.  See e. g., <em>Brennan</em> v. <em>Shore Bros.,
Inc.</em>, 380 Pa. 283, 285, 110 A.2d 401, 402 (1955); <em>Bruker</em> v.
<em>Carlisle Borough</em>, 376 Pa. 330, 334-35, 102 A.2d 418, 420
(1954).
 

<p>   Nevertheless, the growth of ejectment to provide a general remedy
for the recovery of estates in realty did not extend to lessees who
had never been in possession.  In all likelihood this was because at
common law a lessee who had not entered into possession was not
thought to have an estate in land.  Rather, such a lessee was said to
have an ``interesse termini,'' or an interest in a term.
Coke. Litt. 46b; 2 Blackstone, Commentaries * 144.  Whatever the
original usefulness of this distinction may have been, we see no
reason why it should continue to prevent a lessee from maintaining an
action in ejectment.<a name="F1_7"><a href="#FN1_7"><sup><fontsize=-2>7</font></sup></a></a>
 

<p>   Even fifty years ago the rule requiring prior entry was correctly
viewed as a remnant of an earlier age.  Speaking of precisely the rule
we review today, one federal court of appeals then observed:
 <blockquote>
``These things relate to a far-distant past.  They are strangers to
the jurisprudence of the United States.  The modern tendency of
jurisprudence is to look through shadows to substance---to eliminate
technicalities in the interest of substantial justice.  It is no
longer necessary to go upon land as in the days of old and receive a
twig or a clod of dirt as a token of changed possession.  . . . In the
more modern doctrine of ejectment, entry is not a prerequisite to the
action, and if the lessee has such interest in the property as gives a
present right of possession, it is immaterial whether he has entered
 into possession before bringing the action.  The right of
entry, not the entry  itself---the right of possession, not
actual possession---are the essentials of an action in ejectment.''
 </blockquote>
<em>Ewert</em> v. <em>Robinson</em>, 289 F. 740, 750-51 (8th Cir. 1923). 
The notion that prior possession by a lessee is necessary to trigger
the right of possession is a legal fiction unrelated to our more
modern view of a lessee's contractual rights.  See <em>Pugh</em> v.
<em>Holmes</em>, 486 Pa. 272, 405 A.2d 897 (1979) (opinion by Larsen,
J.); <em>id</em>., 486 Pa. at 298-299, 405 A.2d at 910 (Roberts, J.,
joined by Nix and Manderino, JJ., concurring) (holding landlord and
tenant's obligations mutually dependent); see also <em>Albert
M. Greenfield & Co., Inc.</em> v. <em>Kolea</em>, 475 Pa.  351, 380 A.2d
758 (1977) (relieving tenant of obligation to pay rent when premises
destroyed by fire).  We refuse to afford a lessee entitled to
possession by virtue of his lease lesser protection than that given a
fee claimant seeking possession.

<p><center>
   IV
</center>

<p>   By making ejectment available to lessees before entry, we adopt the
view of modern authority.  As stated in 49 Am. Jur.2d <em>Landlord
and Tenant</em> &#167; 220 (1970): <blockquote> ``It seems now generally
agreed that ejectment will lie in favor of the lessee against the
third person, even before entry on the demised premises by the
lessee.''  </blockquote> Accord, Tiffany, 1 The Law of Real Property
&#167; 86 (3d ed. 1939) (and cases cited); 51C C.J.S. <em>Landlord and
Tenant</em> &#167; 314 (1968) (and cases cited).  This is also the result
reached by modern decision, see, e. g., <em>Leader</em> v.
<em>Joyce</em>, 271 Minn. 9, 135 N.W.2d 34 (1965); <em>Wright</em> v. <em>Irving
Trust Co.</em>, 70 F.2d 245, 246 (2d Cir. 1934) (L. Hand,
J.).<a name="F1_8"><a href="#FN1_8"><sup><fontsize=-2>8</font></sup></a></a>
 

<p>      We should not hesitate, in any event, to abolish a rule of law
when its basis has disappeared.  Holmes, <em>The Path of the Law</em>,
10 Harv. L. Rev. 457 (1897); Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial
Process 150-51 (1921).<a name="F1_9"><a href="#FN1_9"><sup><fontsize=-2>9</font></sup></a></a> In recent
times this Court has been alert to reject other out-dated rules which
were no longer in accord with contemporary experience and policy.
<em>Ayala</em> v. <em>Phila. Board of Public Education</em>, 453 Pa. 584, 
603-606, 305 A.2d 877, 886-88 (1973) (abrogating governmental
immunity) (and cases cited); see, e. g., <em>Commonwealth</em> v.
<em>McCusker</em>, 448 Pa. 382, 292 A.2d 286 (1972) (rejecting rule that
psychiatric evidence is inadmissible in murder prosecution for
purposes of determining whether defendant had acted in heat of
passion); <em>Falco</em> v. <em>Pados</em>, 444 Pa. 372, 282 A.2d 351
(1971) (abrogating parental immunity); <em>Reitmeyer</em> v.
<em>Sprecher</em>, 431 Pa. 284, 243 A.2d 395 (1968) (rejecting prior
limitation on landlord's liability for defective conditions);
<em>Flagiello</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania Hospital</em>, 417 Pa. 486, 208 
A.2d 193 (1965) (abrogating charitable immunity).
 

<p>      Indeed, as this Court observed long ago in the specific context
of enlarging the scope of the writ of ejectment: <blockquote> ``Many
other alterations have taken place; and the same authority which
brought it thus far, may certainly carry it to a higher degree of
perfection, as experience happen to show inconveniences, or defects.''
</blockquote> <em>Boyd</em> v. <em>Cowan</em>, 4 Dall. 138, 140 (1794). We
are convinced that the rule we review today does not meet current
societal and jurisprudential needs.  The common law rule now stands as
an unfair barrier to justice and we therefore abolish it.  We hold
that a lessee entitled to present possession of his leasehold may
bring ejectment regardless of whether he has previously entered into
possession.

<p>   The order of the Superior Court is reversed, the order of the Court
of Common Pleas of Allegheny County is vacated and this case is
remanded to the court of common pleas for proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

<p>Manderino, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_1"></a><a href="#F1_1">1</a></b>   The 1962 agreement leased the property to the Soffers
and another couple.  The other couple has since assigned their
interest to appellants.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_2"></a><a href="#F1_2">2</a></b>  The relevant
paragraph of this lease provided: 

<p>``This lease is subject to a prior lease given on the said premises by
George V. Beech and Mary J. Beech, his wife, to the Sun Oil Company,
dated August 15, 1951, for a period of fifteen (15) years, plus right
in the lessee, to two five-year extensions, which said lease has been
assigned by George V. Beech to James L. Beech.  It is understood and
agreed that the lease herein made is subject to all the terms and
provisions of the said lease of August 15, 1951, and that during the
term of the said lease of August 15, 1951, and any extensions thereof,
rentals shall be payable by the Sun Oil Company directly to the said
James L. Beech.  In such case the second parties shall be relieved of
any obligation under the within lease until the expiration of the said
Sun Oil Company lease.''

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_3"></a><a href="#F1_3">3</a></b>  This instrument declared that
the 1951 lease was ``in full force and effect,'' and then provided for
six automatic five-year renewal periods, any of which Sun Oil could
cancel on 180 days written notice.  At the conclusion of these
renewals the lease was to continue from year to year, with 120 days
written notice required of either party in order to terminate.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_4"></a><a href="#F1_4">4</a></b>  Appellee James Beech filed an
answer denying that his 1962 agreement with the Soffers, styled
``LEASE,'' was in fact a lease, and denying that the Soffers were
entitled to either possession or damages.  These issues are not before
us on this appeal, and we express no view on them.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_5"></a><a href="#F1_5">5</a></b>  As recited above, appellants'
complaint alleges that the ``amendment and ratification'' agreement
between James Beech and Sun Oil worked a cancellation of the prior
lease, and, therefore, that appellants became entitled to immediate
possession on January 1, 1975.  Sun Oil has not challenged this claim
and the issue is not before us.  For purposes of this appeal we
assume, without deciding, that appellants were entitled to immediate
possession at the time they filed their complaint.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_6"></a><a href="#F1_6">6</a></b>  The statutory basis for ejectment in
force at the time this case arose declared in sweeping language that
the writ ``shall issue in all cases where lands, tenements or
hereditaments are claimed . . .'' Act of April 13, 1807, P.L.  296,
&#167; 1, 12 P.S. &#167; 1514.  This section has subsequently been repealed by
Act of April 28, 1978, P.L. 202, &#167; 2(a), effective June 27, 1978 and
was replaced by 42 Pa.C.S.A. &#167; 1722(a)(1) which gives this Court
authority to prescribe and modify general rules governing practice and
procedure.

<p>   Because the writ of ejectment was not a real property action, but
originally was an action in trespass, it was not subject to the
hypertechnical pleading rules which surrounded the common law real
actions.  This in part was responsible for the growth and popularity
of ejectment.  See generally Holdsworth, 7 History of English Law 4-10
(1926).  Fee claimants seeking to take advantage of this simple means
of determining title to realty, soon developed methods for using the
writ.  By a series of paper leases and fictitious claims they were
able to frame their dispute to fit within the original pattern of the
ousted tenant's cause of action.  As Blackstone characterized it, the
method ``entirely depends upon a string of legal fictions; no actual
lease is made, no actual entry by the plaintiff, no actual ouster by
the defendant; but all are merely ideal, for the sole purpose of
trying the title.'' 3 Blackstone, Commentaries * 203.  By the
seventeenth century this procedure had become so common that the
English courts instituted reforms calculated to allow these claims
without such contrivances.  This was the beginning of the writ of
ejectment as it exists today.  It is ironic indeed that courts, in
their willingness to determine title to property, have knowingly
accepted wholly fictitious claims of lease, entry and ouster, but have
been unwilling to provide a remedy to actual lessees, such as the
Soffers, who do not make these fictitious claims.

<p>   We note that our rules of civil procedure have abandoned the
historic system of pleading in ejectment in favor of the more
straight-forward assumpsit rules, Pa.R.C.P. 1051-1058.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_7"></a><a href="#F1_7">7</a></b>  In <em>St. Vincent's Roman Catholic
Cong. of Plymouth</em> v. <em>Kingston Coal Co.</em>, 221 Pa. 349, 70
A. 838 (1908) this Court held that a lease for twenty-one years or
more, if properly recorded, vests an estate for years in the lessee
and not simply an interesse termini.  This result was based on the
Court's construction of certain provisions of our recording act, still
in effect today, Act of May 28, 1715, 1 Sm.L. 94, &#167; 5, 21 P.S. &#167; 471
(1955 and Supp.1979).  We note that the Soffers' complaint alleges a
lease for more than twenty-one years and proper recording.  This would
vest the Soffers with an estate for years and not an interesse
termini.  But whatever this distinction may mean in other contexts, we
expressly refuse to make the availability of ejectment turn on such
niceties.  There is little to explain even the original usefulness of
the common law distinction between an estate for years and an
interesse termini; it has been rejected by text-writers who have
called it ``difficult to comprehend,'' Tiffany, 1 The Law of Real
Property 132 (3d ed. 1939), and it has been abolished by statute in
England, Law of Property Act of 1925 &#167; 149(1).  We refuse to use the
concept now to create an artificial barrier to the remedy of
ejectment.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_8"></a><a href="#F1_8">8</a></b>  The Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and
Tenant &#167; 6.1 (1976) is intended to apply to situations where a tenant
is deprived of possession or use of his leasehold by the landlord or
by action attributable to him.  This section allows the tenant to
terminate his lease or continue the lease and recover damages, abate
rent, use rent to eliminate the interference or withhold rent and
place it in escrow.  Comment b to this section makes it clear,
however, that other relief may also be available:
<blockquote>
   ``b. Unauthorized possession or conduct.  An unauthorized
possession of all or any part of the leased property by the landlord,
or someone whose conduct is attributable to him, is an eviction of the
tenant that could be cured by the tenant himself.  The rule of this
section does not require him to take legal steps available to him to
eliminate the eviction, although that option is open to him.''
</blockquote>

<p>   Companion section 6.2, applicable when the tenant is deprived of
possession by a third party, expressly adopts the view that a ``tenant
may recover the possession of the leased property from the third party
improperly in possession.''

<p>   The Illustrations to both of these sections make clear that the rules of the
Restatement are not limited to situations where the tenant previously has been
ousted.  See, e. g., &#167; 6.1, Comment c, Illustration 7; &#167; 6.2, Comment b,
Illustration 2.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_9"></a><a href="#F1_9">9</a></b>  In The Path of the Law, 10 Harv.
L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897), Justice Holmes remarked: ``It is revolting
to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid
down in the time of Henry IV.  It is still more revolting if the
grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the
rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.''

I have to use this round-about way of getting the instructions to you because I

<center><h3><a name="Palaetiology">Palaetiology: The Historical Sciences</a>
</h3></center>

<i>Palaetiology</i>: ``The term `palaetiology' was coined in 1837 by
English philosopher, historian, and educator William Whewell (1794-1866)
to refer to those sciences which have as their object the reconstruction
of the past based on the evidence of the present.  Whewell's two
exemplary palaetiological sciences were geology and comparative
philology, but he recognized that many different disciplines had
palaetiological divisions.'' [Robert J. O'Hara, <a
href="http://rjohara.uncg.edu/palaetiology.html">Palaetiology</a> on the
<a href="http://rjohara.uncg.edu/">Darwin-L Web Server</a>.]

<p>
I am convinced, for reasons which I hope will eventually be made clear on 
this web server and elsewhere, that law, like language, can only be 
understood by taking a palaetiological approach--that law, and especially
our Common Law, can only be understood by studying how it has evolved
over the centuries.  We can only understand the past by studying the 
"evidence of the present" and we can only understand the present by 
understanding how we came to be where we are right now.  

<p>
I am convinced that we can only 
understand the present by understanding the past.

<p>
The key resource on the web for the comparative study of the historical 
sciences is the Darwin-L Web Server maintained by Robert J. O'Hara:

Eventually this site will contain materials for use in, or that are
relevant to, the course in Computers and the Law taught by Peter
D. Junger at CWRU Law School.  But at the moment it needs extensive
revision.

The most important current issue involves the conflict between the export
regulations on cryptographic software and the freedoms of speech and of
the press, and as to this matter there is now a
separate web page collecting all the materials relating to <a
href="crypto_export/">Free Speech and the Export of Crypto</a>.

<p>
The materials will eventually include law cases, legislative
materials, reports, and other textual materials that are stored on
this server as well as links to materials stored on other servers.

<p> Related to this portion of the course is the suit that I have
brought, with the aid of Gino Scarselli, Raymond Vasvari, and Kevin
O'Neill to enjoin the enforcement of those provisions of the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the <a href="/itar.html">
"ITAR"</a>) that require one to obtain a license or a waiver of
jurisdiction--that is, a so-called ``Commodity Jurisdiction
Determination''--before one may publish or otherwise disclose
information about cryptography to a foreign person or transmit such
information outside the United States. <em>See</em><a href="jvc">
<em>Junger</em> v. <em>Christopher</em></a>.

         Inc. web site! SMI has been assisting couples and
         individuals since 1984. We are one of a select few
         programs in the country that has never had a woman change
         her mind, and one of only three programs which is run by an
         attorney. We have been a member of the Better Business
         Bureau since 1986, with no complaints filed against us. We
         have had the pleasure of assisting couples from across the
         world in creating families. Our surrogate program is a full
         service agency, coordinating all medical, travel, and legal
         procedures. It is the only recognized surrogacy program in
         the world which also openly works with gay and lesbian
         couples/individuals. As of the writing of this home page, we
         have had nearly 90 babies born. We have another 50 couples
         from across the world who have selected surrogates and are
         expecting, or hoping to be expecting soon. We also have
         another 50 women available to be surrogates.<HR WIDTH="90%">

      <TD>
         <P>There are actually four options available for couples
         looking to select a surrogate, and for women considering
         being in our program. They are as follows:
         
         <OL>
            <LI>Artificial insemination (AI): The surrogate is
            artificially inseminated with the sperm from the husband
            of the couple. The child is genetically related to the
            surrogate. The wife of the couple adopts the child via a
            step-parent adoption.
            <BR>
<BR>

            <LI>In vitro fertilization/Embryo transfer (IVF/ET): An
            egg (or eggs) is retrieved from the wife of the couple,
            combined with her husband's sperm, and the resulting
            embryo(s) is implanted in the surrogate. The child is not
            genetically related to the surrogate, and the couple's
            names go on the original birth certificate.
            <BR>
<BR>

            <LI>Egg Donor (ED): The "surrogate" donates an egg (or
            eggs) which is fertilized with the husband's sperm, and
            the embryo is then transferred to his wife. The child is
            genetically related to the surrogate, but because the
            wife delivers the child, she does not need to adopt it.
            This is sort of a reverse surrogacy.
            <BR>
<BR>

            <LI>Artificial Insemination by Donor (AID): The surrogate
            is artificially inseminated with donor sperm, because
            both the husband and the wife of the couple are
            infertile. The child is genetically related to the
            surrogate, and both the husband and wife must adopt it.
         </OL>

         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Q. What types of women become
         surrogates?</FONT></B>
         
         <P>A. In SMI's program, a surrogate must be between 18-35
         and have previously had a child. The typical surrogate is
         28, married, employed, and solidly middle class. The single
         characteristic describing all of our surrogates is altruism.
         The women in our program are generous, caring, healthy
         women. They become surrogates to help people have families.
         Unlike other programs which look for poor women (based on
         the mistaken belief that a poor woman is less likely to keep
         the child), our surrogates are never motivated by financial
         need. Their fee, which generally is around $13,000, is a
         factor, but never the main reason for their participation.
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"> </FONT></B>
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Q. What do couples look for in a
         surrogate?</FONT></B>
         
         <P>A. Couples base their decision on many factors. Some
         couples select a woman because of her location or physical
         similarity. Others want a surrogate who is intelligent. All
         couples, however, look for a woman who is healthy, has no
         significant medical/psychological difficulties, is
         emotionally and mentally stable, conceives easily, and who
         is responsible and mature enough to realize that the couple
         is placing an enormous amount of trust in her to carry their
         child.
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"> </FONT></B>
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Q. Is the surrogate
         screened?</FONT></B>
         
         <P>A. Absolutely. The surrogates go through a variety of
         different screening processes. References are checked,
         medical records from prior pregnancies are obtained, a
         criminal history check is done, and the surrogate (and her
         husband if married) are then given a complete psychological
         exam. The couple gets a copy of the psyc report, and they
         make a final decision if the surrogate is acceptable.
         Approximately 1% - 2% of all women who initially contact SMI
         actually end up being accepted into the program.
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"> </FONT></B>
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Q. What happens if the surrogate
         refuses to give up the child?</FONT></B>
         
         <P>A. Of the 2000 or so births to surrogates in the country,
         a woman has refused to relinquish the child less than 1% of
         the time. SMI has never had this happen. In every case where
         it has, the surrogate either was not screened at all, or the
         couple was not made aware of the psychological findings.
         When surrogacy is done right, it works.
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"> </FONT></B>
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Q. What are the success
         rates?</FONT></B>
         
         <P>A. "Success" should only mean one thing: the percentage
         of couples/individuals who actually end up with a child. In
         the AI program, your success rate depends on the male's
         sperm count and the surrogate's ability to conceive. 85% of
         all of SMI's clients in the AI program end up with a child.
         On the average, it takes our surrogates 3 cycles to
         conceive. Some take longer. Many get pregnant on the first
         try. In the IVF/ET program, the success rates are much
         lower, primarily because the wives of the couples are much
         older. In that program, the success rate is about 20%-25%.
         SMI will work with you as long as you wish. There are
         additional legal fees if you switch surrogates.
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"> </FONT></B>
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Q. Will the couple and the
         surrogate meet?</FONT></B>
         
         <P>A. SMI encourages "open surrogacy." The reason for this
         is simple: because our surrogates are not doing this for the
         money, they want (and have every right) to know the types of
         people for whom they are doing this. Meeting the surrogate
         allows both sides to make sure that the arrangement will
         work. Most of our couples stay in contact with their
         surrogate frequently during the pregnancy. Even after the
         birth, many couples still stay in touch with their
         surrogates (X-mas cards, birthday cards, etc.), although for
         most couples and surrogates the relationship ends after the
         baby is born.

         <P>Total approximate expenses, then, will be as little as
         about $15,000 (if the surrogate is not charging any fee and
         has insurance, which is very unlikely), or as much as
         $40,000 (is she is asking for $20,000 and does not have
         insurance, which also is unlikely). The average total cost,
         including everything above, is around $35,000. As a general
         guide, you can figure on at least $18,000 in expenses
         (includes everything except the surrogate's fee, and assumes
         a successful pregnancy after the first procedure). If you
         are participating in the IVF/ET program, the medical
         expenses will be significantly higher. Your insurance might
         cover some of these expenses, as well as some of my fees.
         These costs are intended as a guideline only. The actual
         costs may or may not exceed these figures. The legal fees,
         advertising costs, and psychological expenses are guaranteed
         not to increase once you have signed a contract, and if you
         withdraw from the program for any reason prior to a contract
         being signed with your surrogate, the legal fees are
         refunded in full.

      <TD>
         <P>18 states have laws which in some fashion address
         surrogacy. Five have actually seen fit to criminalize
         surrogacy. They are AZ, MI, NY, UT, WA, as well as D.C. The
         other states have laws which say surrogate contracts are
         invalid, which set up elaborate mechanisms to approve
         contracts, or which regulate the payment of fees to
         surrogates.
         
         <P>In the AI program, SMI goes to court before the child is
         born and obtains a court order saying that the husband (or
         single man) is the father of the child, and directing that
         his name go on the original birth certificate. After the
         child is born, the surrogate signs consent forms which
         either terminate her parental rights, leaving the man with
         sole custody of the child, or which allow the wife of the
         couple to adopt. That step-parent adoption generally takes
         place in the couple's state, unless they reside in one of
         the states where surrogacy is illegal. In that case, that
         adoption can occur in another state.
         
         <P>In the embryo transfer program, a similar pre-birth court
         order is obtained, except that this order says that the
         couple are the child's biological parents, and their names
         go directly on the original birth certificate. No adoption
         is necessary since they are the biological parents. In
         either case, the couple (or individual) will take the child
         directly from the hospital back home with them.

         <P>These figures represent an average total cost, including
         all expenses, but assume two things: 1) that your surrogate
         is charging $13,000 for her fee and has insurance which
         covers the pregnancy, and 2) that your surrogate conceives
         within the first 3 AI attempts or on the first IVF/ET
         attempt. Total actual fees depend, of course, on the
         location of your surrogate, how many tries it takes before
         she conceives, her fee, etc. At whatever point you select a
         surrogate, you make an initial $15,000 into SMI's escrow
         account. Additional deposits, if necessary, are made when
         you receive your monthly accounting statement.

      </TD><TD COLSPAN=10>
         <P>The legal fees, as explained in the accompanying
         information, are divided into 2 parts. The first part is the
         initial withdrawal; the second is the withdrawal that occurs
         only after a pregnancy has been achieved.

         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><A NAME="***">***</A>
      </TD><TD COLSPAN=10>
         <P>Most surrogates ask for around $13,000, although we are
         beginning to see somewhat higher fees. If you select a
         surrogate who is charging more than $13,000, you would add
         the difference to the total cost of the program. You will
         know this information prior to selecting her. Your
         surrogate's fee is deposited with SMI within 5 days after
         she conceives.

      </TD><TD COLSPAN=10>
         <P>AID surrogacy is generally difficult to do unless you and
         your surrogate are from the same state. If you are, then the
         procedures are treated the same as any other traditional
         adoption.

         Inc. web site! SMI has been assisting couples and
         individuals since 1984. We are one of a select few
         programs in the country that has never had a woman change
         her mind, and one of only three programs which is run by an
         attorney. We have been a member of the Better Business
         Bureau since 1986, with no complaints filed against us. We
         have had the pleasure of assisting couples from across the
         world in creating families. Our surrogate program is a full
         service agency, coordinating all medical, travel, and legal
         procedures. It is the only recognized surrogacy program in
         the world which also openly works with gay and lesbian
         couples/individuals. As of the writing of this home page, we

The 21 Benefits of Membership in AAII</H2>


Here are the 21 benefits we offer to our members--they are provided free with membership or at special member prices . . .<P>



       <strong> #1  The AAII Journal (free to members) --</strong> Published 10 times a year, the Journal provides you with a continuing stream of information on investment.  Recent topics include: how you can reduce risk;  how to evaluate investment newsletters; how a living trust can help with your estate planning; the characteristics of stock market winners; comparing insurance products objectively.  The "Points of View" section interviews leading professional money managers and examines their approaches to managing investments--stocks, high yield bonds, muni bonds, real estate, convertibles.<P>


        Articles in the Journal always focus on how you can improve your results.  While some articles cover the latest findings of academic research, there are also articles by experienced practitioners such as Peter Lynch, John Bogle, T. Boone Pickens, Robert Stovall, Ken Gregory and Mark Hulbert.<P>



<strong>
        #2  Shadow Stock Coverage (free to members) -- </strong> A special section of the Journal provides the results of screens that many investors use to select stocks (P/E ratio, debt/equity, book value, earnings growth, etc.).  These screens can save you considerable time in your search for undervalued stocks. They emphasize the "Shadow Stocks"--stocks ignored by institutions because of size and not covered much by analysts . . . but solid and profitable.  <P>



<strong>        #3  The "Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Mutual Funds" (free to members) -- </strong> Mailed to you in March each year, this book provides in-depth analysis of over 800 funds and discusses how to select the best funds for you.  Awarded the only four star (top) rating by Kiplinger's Personal Finance, this widely acclaimed book sells to the general public for $24.95, but as an AAII member it is yours free.  Barron's calls it "...one of the best books around on the subject."  Most of our members use mutual funds for at least part of their portfolio and this book represents only part of our coverage of this important topic.  <P>



<strong>        #4  Local Chapter Membership --</strong> There are over 60 chapters now operating in metropolitan areas and more are being added.  Chapters offer the opportunity to meet with fellow members and to hear experts discuss a variety of investment topics.  The similarity of interests has led to close personal relationships among members and the development of many SIGS (special interest subgroups) in such areas as computers, real estate investment, mutual funds and stock screening approaches.  As a member you can participate with no additional dues.<P>



<strong>        #5  AAII Year-End Tax Strategy Guide (free to members) -- </strong>Each year at the end of November members receive an extensive guide to the tax planning aspects of investment.  The guide is based on the latest laws and rulings.<P>



<strong>        #6  AAII Quoteline (free to members) --</strong> AAII Quoteline permits you to use your phone to obtain real time (not delayed) quotes on stocks, options, and mutual funds.  You may also establish a theoretical portfolio with a number of shares and receive the current value of each stock and the entire portfolio at any time.<P>



<strong>        #7  Investment Seminars (at reduced cost) --</strong> Over 50 seminars are conducted in cities throughout the United States each year -- from introductory to advanced in a variety of subjects.  We also have seminars on video. Each seminar is designed to provide practical ways to improve your investment results.<P>



<strong>        #8  Study Programs (at reduced cost) --</strong> AAII offers a wide variety of home study materials to its members.  These materials are constantly being expanded and revised and are designed to take individual investors as far as they want to go--from basics to the concepts of a graduate course in investment theory.  <P>



<strong>        #9  Computer Users Newsletter --</strong> Because a growing number of members are using computers in their investment decision making, AAII publishes an optional bimonthly newsletter.  This publication, Computerized Investing, evaluates software and explores a variety of ways to make the computer a more effective investment tool.  The price of Computerized Investing is $40/year to the public, but only $30/year to members.<P>



<strong>        #10  The "Individual Investor's Guide to Computerized Investing" --</strong> Subscribers to Computerized Investing also receive our annual 200+ page guide to investment software and databases at no additional cost.<P>
 
 

<strong>        #11  AAII "Stock Investor" --</strong> For computer users this is our newest optional service -- quarterly disks providing well over 100 items of the latest information from the Market Guide database.  This service covers 6000 stocks and has powerful screening capabilities.  Available to members at a fraction of the cost of comparable products.<P>



<strong>        #12  Dividend Reinvestment Plans --</strong> Hundreds of major corporations allow you to buy additional stock with your dividends, without commissions and often at a below market price.  AAII members receive a free listing of these companies each June with "how to" information. The information is also on the "Stock Investor" computer program.<P>



<strong>        #13  Stock Brokerage Survey --</strong> Each January you receive free our survey of the charges and services of brokerage firms.  This free coverage also provides an analysis to help you choose the pricing system and service package that best suits your individual needs.<P>



<strong>        #14 "A Lifetime Strategy for Investing in Common Stocks" --</strong> This booklet described at the end of this letter is yours free.<P>



<strong>        #15  Publication Discounts --</strong> Substantial discounts are available on investment software and investment publications (i.e., Money, Investor's Business Daily, Business Week, Financial World).  And through Standard & Poor's Corporation we have arranged for members to receive S&P reports for a number of corporations at no cost.<P>



<strong>        #16  Special Credit Card --</strong> Members are eligible to apply for a special AAII Gold Visa Card with no annual fees, with very special privileges, and a very competitive interest rate (prime plus 6.9%). <P>


<strong>
        #17  The "Best of Both Worlds" Money Market --</strong> Members can also participate in a special AAII money market bank account--a bank money market account that guarantees a yield above the average of all money market mutual funds and provides the FDIC insurance of a bank.  The best of both worlds. This single benefit could earn you much more than the membership dues.  <P>
        
        

<strong>        #18  Quarterly Low-Load Mutual Fund Update --</strong> This new optional service provides information quarterly on all the funds covered in our Low-Load Guide.  It is available in print or on computer disk.<P>

        

<strong>        #19  Research - The Hidden Benefit --</strong> The value of the AAII Journal, our seminars and all of our materials is enhanced by the internal research of our staff.  In addition, we screen current academic research (often before publication) to find insights into improving investment performance.  We not only report on that research, but we sponsor much of it by awards to university faculty and doctoral students.<P>



<strong>        #20  AAII Website -</strong> You're already taking advantage of the interactive forum we provide to distribute and communicate with our members. <P>
 

   That's who we are, what we do, and our specific programs.  AAII is a totally independent non-profit association.  We don't even accept advertising in our Journal.  And we grow and change to meet the needs of our members.  We will continue to do so with, we hope, your participation and insight.  There is no other source for this combination of help and support.<P>


        Our dues are only $49 per year.  A single insight gained from our Journal, a seminar or other AAII program will repay the membership cost many times over.  In fact, the publication discounts and other special benefits alone may exceed the dues.  As Forbes says, "The $49 a year it costs to belong is a bargain."  <P>



<strong>        And Benefit #21 </strong>  You risk nothing by joining ....Because we cannot fully explain AAII in a letter online, we make this promise:  If you decide at any time during the year after joining that AAII is not contributing to your investment skills, we will refund your annual membership dues in full -- no questions.  We offer this unusual assurance because not only do most of our members renew each year, but over 30% have become Lifetime Members.  This policy also applies to Computerized Investing.<P>

        
        We are not offering any magic formula for overnight riches. The key to successful management of your assets requires self-discipline and a reasonable investment of time and effort.<P>

Basic Investment Principles of Risk and Return</H2></P>


<HR>

When building an investment portfolio, you need to start with an investment foundation. Boiled down to its bare basics, investing concerns returns and risks.<P>

An investor's return consists of current income, plus capital gains due to growth, minus any losses from the investment. Sounds simple, and it is, except that most investors would prefer to know the return before making the investment.<P>


Absent a crystal ball, you can only make an educated guess as to what kind of return to expect. If your actual return turns out to be different than the return you expected, you could suffer an unexpected loss.<P>


Of course, your expected return must be reasonable--expecting a return of 25% just because your stockbroker says that's what you'll earn is not reasonable. But even if your expectations are reasonable, there's always the possibility that your investment's actual return will be different than expected. This is the risk you must take on as an investor, and it includes the possibility of losing some or all of your original investment. The greater the uncertainty, the greater the risk.<P>


What is uncertainty? The future is uncertain, and the longer you must wait for your return--or, the longer the time period over which you must make your educated guess as to return--the greater the uncertainty. In addition, the quality and stability of the investment is uncertain. <P>


There are several major sources of uncertainty, or risk, that could produce unexpected returns. They include:<P>


<UL><LI>Business and industry risk: The uncertainty of an investment's ability to pay income, principal, and any other returns due to a significant fall-off in business (either firm-related or industry-wide) or bankruptcy.<P>


<LI>Inflation risk: The uncertainty over future inflation rates, which results in uncertainty over the future real (after-inflation) value of your investment. An investment that barely keeps pace with inflation will not be able to grow in real terms, leaving only as much purchasing power in the future as you have today. <P>


<LI>Market risk: The risk that the general market or economic environment will cause the investment to lose value regardless of the particular security. A stock may drop in value simply because the overall stock market has fallen; this is referred to as stock market risk. A bond doesn't face stock market risk, but it may drop in value due to a rise in interest rates; this is referred to as interest rate risk.<P>

<LI>Liquidity risk: The risk of not being able to get out of the investment conveniently at a reasonable price. This can occur for a number of reasons. If the market is volatile, you may be forced to sell at a significant loss if you must sell immediately. Another cause can be an inactive market. For instance, it may be difficult to sell a house simply because there are no buyers.<P></UL>


All investments face each of these risks, but the degree of risk varies greatly. For instance, stocks face much less inflation risk than bonds. On the other hand, short-term bonds and money market investments face little liquidity risk, while stocks face a greater liquidity risk, since you may be forced to sell at an inopportune time, suffering a large loss.<P>


Ironically, it is uncertainty that creates the potential for higher returns. How? Because of the risk/return trade-off.<P>


Every investor wants the highest assured return possible. But as we have seen, returns aren't certain, and different investors have varying degrees of uncertainty that they are willing to accept. In fact, each investor seeks the highest possible return at the level of uncertainty, or risk, that he is willing to accept.
<P>

In a competitive marketplace, this results in a trade-off: Low levels of uncertainty (low risk) are the most desirable, and are therefore associated with low potential returns. High levels of uncertainty (high risk) are the most undesirable, and are therefore associated with high potential returns.<P>


Over the last 50 years, stocks have produced returns that average 13% annually; long-term bonds have averaged 5% annually and short-term Treasury bills have averaged 4.5% annually. These returns reflect the risk/return trade-off. The trade-off, however, exists on average, not in every single instance: Remember, it's the uncertainty that's the risk. As an investor, you must analyze each investment, comparing the potential returns with the risks. The trade-off also serves as a warning flag--high potential returns usually flag high risks, even when those risks are not obvious at first glance.<P>


While potential returns should compensate you for risk, there are some risks that you will not be compensated for, and therefore they should be avoided.<P>


If you invest in a single security, your return will depend solely on that security; if that security flops, your entire return will be severely affected. Clearly, held by itself, the single security is highly risky.<P>


If you add nine other unrelated securities to that single security portfolio, the possible outcome changes--if that security flops, your entire return won't be as badly hurt. By diversifying your investments, you have substantially reduced the risk of the single security. However, that security's return will be the same whether held in isolation or in a portfolio.<P>


Diversification substantially reduces your risk with little impact on potential returns. The key involves investing in categories or securities that are dissimilar: Their returns are affected by different factors and they face different kinds of risks.<P>


Diversification should occur at all levels of investing. Diversification among the major asset categories--stocks, fixed-income and money market investments--can help reduce market risk, inflation risk and liquidity risk, since these categories are affected by different market and economic factors.<P>


Diversification within the major asset categories--for instance, among the various kinds of stocks (international or domestic, for instance) or fixed-income products--can help further reduce market and inflation risk.<P>


And as shown in the 10-security portfolio, diversification among individual securities helps reduce business risk.<P>


There is one other type of diversification that is extremely important yet often overlooked--time diversification, remaining invested over different market cycles.<P>


Time diversification helps reduce the risk that you may enter or leave a particular investment or category at a bad time in the economic cycle. It has much more of an impact on investments that have a high degree of volatility, such as stocks, where prices can fluctuate over the short term. Longer time periods smooth those fluctuations. Conversely, if you cannot remain invested in a volatile investment over relatively long time periods, those investments should be avoided. Time diversification is less important for relatively stable investments, such as certificates of deposit, money market funds and short-term bonds.<P>


Time diversification also comes into play when investing or withdrawing large sums of money. In general, it is better to do so gradually over time, rather than all at once, to reduce risk.<P>


In building your investment portfolio, you are simply seeking answers to these questions:<P>


<UL><LI> What are the risks?


<LI> What risks can be eliminated or reduced through diversification and which risks will remain?


<LI> What are the returns associated with the risks I will be undertaking?</UL><P>


The answer to the last question is a balance of those risks and potential returns, based on your own personal circumstances and your tolerance for risk.<P>

Building Toward an Investment Plan Starting From Scratch </H2><P>
<HR>

How do you go about starting an effective investment program if you are young or entering the investment world with a very small amount of money available to invest?<p>


First, of course, you should go through the asset allocation process, determining your allocation among the major asset categories, and then further down among the major stock market segments. This will serve as your ultimate goal.<p>


However, you won't be able to implement it immediately. Why? Mutual funds are the preferred route for newcomers, because they can provide broad diversification, as well as professional expertise at a low cost. However, most mutual funds have minimum initial investments. That means that if you have, say, $2,000 to invest, you will start out by investing in only one fund.<p>


What kind of funds can serve as starter funds? Here are two approaches:<p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>A Balanced Start:</strong> Under this approach, you would start your investment program by investing in a balanced or asset allocation fund that divides its assets in a relatively set range between stocks, bonds, and cash. Additional investments can be made to the fund until you have saved enough to begin investing in funds in more specific market segments.<p>


This has the major advantage of immediate diversification in the major asset categories with one minimum initial investment. The disadvantage, however, is that you cannot control the allocation--and many younger investors seek heavier commitments to stocks than is typical of balanced funds.<p>


Another disadvantage is that as you build up your savings, you will most likely outgrow the balanced fund--in other words, you will want to switch from the balanced fund to several different funds according to your asset allocation plan. If your balanced fund is taxable savings, you will have to pay taxes on any gains when you switch.<p>


If you use this approach, make sure that you fully understand your chosen fund's investment approach, because the names can be confusing. Some funds that call themselves "asset allocation funds" try to time the various market segments by changing their asset mix depending on their outlook. These types of funds should be avoided.<p>


<li><strong>Concentrating On Core Stocks: </strong>Under this approach, you would save up to the minimum initial investment of a broad-based stock index fund, and then invest the entire amount in it. The disadvantage, of course, is that you are fully exposed to the stock market during this time. But since you are just starting out, you most likely have a very long-term time frame (possibly over 30 years) and can afford to take on substantial stock market risk.<p>


The index fund serves as the core of your overall portfolio as you start to build toward your investment plan. It will be the most conservative portion of your stock market commitment, composed primarily of large-capitalization stocks; when you add on, you will be adding on more aggressive commitments--small stocks and international, for instance.<p>


Using an index fund gives you exposure to the stock market, but takes out "manager risk." For investment newcomers, this makes the mutual fund selection less daunting. However, you do need to focus on an appropriate index. Since the fund will be your core stock holdings, you should select one that targets a large-cap stock market index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 or a broader index that still encompasses large-cap stocks, such as the Wilshire 5000. <p>
</ul>

Once you have picked a starter fund using either the balanced fund or core approach, keep adding to it over time, and gradually build up your commitment with the ultimate goal of matching the investment strategy you set up originally. Concentrate first on meeting your allocation goals among the three major market segments--cash, bonds, and core stocks.<p>


If you started with a balanced fund, you may want to next add a stock fund (once you can meet the minimum) to increase your percentage investment in stocks, and perhaps an intermediate-term bond fund after that; you can then start the switch out of the balanced fund.<p>


If you started with a core index fund, you could next add the minimum to an intermediate-term bond fund (in fact, you will have created your own "balanced" fund).<p>


At what point do you start diversifying beyond the major market segments--in particular, when should you consider diversifying your stock portfolio beyond the core? This will depend on the minimum initial investments of the funds that you have chosen and the percentages that you plan to commit to the other market segments. However, to have a meaningful effect, you really need a minimum commitment of around 10% to any market segment.<p>


Lastly, don't agonize over small deviations from your overall allocation plan. For instance, if a minimum investment in a small stock fund results in a 12% or 13% commitment to small stocks, and your strategy only calls for a 10% commitment to small stocks, go ahead and invest. Your overall allocation goal is only a rough guide.<p>

Life Cycle Investing: Your Personal Investment Profile</H2></P>

<HR>

No two investors are alike either in terms of personality or in their own financial situations. So why should their investment plans be similar?<P>


In fact, they should not be. Instead, an individual's investment plan should be tailored to his own personal investment profile. There are four basic aspects that compose an investor's personal investment profile:<P>


<UL><LI>Your personal tolerance for risk


<LI>Return needs and whether current income or future growth needs to be emphasized


<LI>Time horizon


<LI>Tax exposure
</UL>

The amount of risk you are willing to take on is an extremely important factor to consider before making an investment because of the severe consequences of taking on too much risk. Risk is uncertainty--the possibility that the investment won't perform as expected. Properly assessing risk tolerance is designed to prevent an investor from making panic decisions and abandoning an investment plan mid-stream at the worst possible time.<P>


How can tolerance be measured? The best approach is to simply examine the worst-case scenario--a loss over a one-year period--and ask yourself whether you could stick with your investment plan in the face of such a loss.<P>


Investors with a low tolerance for risk generally can sustain losses of no more than 5% over a one-year period. Investors with a moderate tolerance for risk can generally withstand losses of between 6% to 15% over a one-year period. Investors with a high tolerance for risk can generally withstand losses of 16% to 25% over one year.<P>


Determining your return needs is important because you can't have all of everything--there is no investment that offers a high certain payout each year, protects your principal and offers a high potential for growth.<P>


There are a number of trade-offs, based on the risk/return trade-off. First, the price for principal protection is lower returns, usually in the form of lower annual income. There is also a trade-off between income and growth: The more certain the annual payment, the less risky the investment, and therefore the lower the potential return in the form of growth.<P>


The length of time you will or can be invested is important because it can directly affect your ability to reduce risk. Time diversification is most critical for volatile investments such as stocks, where prices fluctuate greatly over the short term, but are considerably smoothed over longer time periods.<P>


If your time horizon is short, you cannot effectively be diversified across different market environments. Longer time horizons allow you to take on greater risks--with a greater return potential--because some of that risk can be reduced through time diversification.<P>


How should time horizon be measured? Your time horizon starts with whenever your investment portfolio is implemented, and ends when you will need to take the money out of your investment portfolio.<P>


If you are investing to save for a specific event, such as tuition payments or the purchase of a house, your time horizon is fairly easily measured--it ends when you need the cash. If you are investing to accumulate a sum for periodic withdrawals, such as during retirement, your time horizon is more difficult to quantify as you approach the time that withdrawals will begin.<P>


What constitutes short-, intermediate and long-term time horizons?<P>


To diversify over various economic cycles, you must be invested through one complete economic cycle at the very least. In general, the economic cycle lasts about five years, which can be considered a long-term horizon.  <P>


Conversely, if you need money within a year or two, you have a short-term horizon. A somewhat longer-term outlook--two to five years--constitutes an intermediate-term horizon.<P>


The bottom line to all investors is what's left after taxes. Investors who are in higher income tax brackets need to be concerned with the tax implications of their investments. Investors who are in lower income tax brackets need to worry less about the tax implications, but they also need to avoid securities that benefit high tax-exposure investors, such as municipal bonds.<P>


With the tax laws changing regularly, it is difficult to quantify what constitutes "higher" and "lower" tax exposure (perhaps the terms should be changed to "high" and "even higher"). However, if your annual income level puts you within the top federal income tax categories, you fall within the "higher" category.<P>


Clearly different investors have different profiles. But the same individual will also have different profiles at different stages in life. For instance, your tolerance for risk may change as you get older, as you acquire more assets and as you become more financially secure. When you approach retirement, your time horizon may shift and become a blend of long-term and medium- or short-term needs.<P>


Table 1 shows how an investor's profile may change. Of course, your own profile may be very different than this one; it may even fit one of those listed here, such as early retirement, even though you are in a different stage, such as early career. <P> 


An effective investment plan is based on a balance between the risks you are willing to take on and the returns you need to achieve your goals. An understanding of your investment profile will help you achieve that balance.<P>

Picking Stocks: Techniques That Stand the Test of Time </H2><P>
<HR>

Research on stock selection often seems contradictory. Yet, study after study has found that certain factors do have long-term significance.<p>


Which techniques and overall investment approaches seem to have withstood the test of time? Here's a short survey of those that appear to work over long time periods:<p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Seeking Firms That Sell At A Low Market-Price-To-Book-Value Ratio: </strong>This is one technique that continuously turns up in studies as being successful. However, there are some interpretation problems. A price-to-book-value screen will tend to turn up stocks that are concentrated in a few industries that traditionally sell at low price-to-book-value ratios (price per share divided by assets less liabilities on a per share basis), as well as many "troubled firms" that require unique analysis. The low price-to-book-value screen may simply be a proxy for neglected or out-of-favor firms and industries--firms that may have been driven below their real value by overreaction to negative news. However, screening for firms with a price-to-book-value ratio that is low relative to an industry average, and for firms with a price-to-book-value ratio below 1.00, a very select group, still appears to be a productive investment approach. <p>


<li><strong>Seeking Firms That Sell At A Low Price-To-Earnings Ratio: </strong>This is another long-time classic, although with similar interpretation problems. In most research, firms with the lowest price-earnings ratios (price per share divided by earnings per share) using trailing earnings--earnings for the most recent four quarters--produce the highest returns before and after adjusting for risk. The price-to-book-value ratio approach, however, in recent research seems to capture the same kinds of firms as the low-price-earnings-ratio screen, while at the same time producing better results.<p>


<li><strong>Concentrating On Stocks With Low Market Capitalization--Price Per Share Times Number Of Shares Outstanding: </strong>
Countless studies have indicated that small capitalization stocks have provided above-market returns even after adjusting for risk. Why? Probably due to neglect--with less media exposure, less institutional ownership and less analyst scrutiny, investors have more chance to uncover bargains. Interestingly, most of the above-average returns have tended to come in January and, more recently, starting in mid-December; the studies, however, have failed to come up with a convincing explanation for this calendar effect. What constitutes "small"? Definitions have varied, but the original studies concentrated on firms of around $100 million or less. On the other hand, some recent research suggests that differences in capitalization are not as important when the data is adjusted for differences in price-to-book-value ratio.<p>


<li><strong>Seeking Stocks That Have Recently Seen Upward Revisions In Analysts' Earnings Forecasts: </strong>The larger the upward revision in a consensus earnings forecast (the average of estimates by financial analysts), the greater the near-term returns, according to some studies. While the price reaction is not an unexpected result, the fact that above-market risk-adjusted returns tend to persist well after the revision is more surprising. Analysts are always changing forecasts as new information is available and expectations change, but it is easier to monitor earnings forecast revisions than the variable set followed by analysts. <p>


<li><strong>Seeking Stocks With Large Earnings Surprises: </strong>Positive or negative earnings surprises--when announced earnings vary from earnings consensus estimates--cause reactions in price on the days prior to the announcement and on the earnings announcement date. Apparently, leaks abound when the news is exceptionally good or bad. The real surprise is that the stock price adjustment process continues for quite some time, perhaps a year for a serious surprise. And the price adjustment is greater for negative surprises than for positive surprises. Also, it is not too late to buy after the announcement of a large positive earnings surprise, but buying right after the announcement of a large negative earnings surprise is a bit premature; shorting the stock (borrowing the shares to sell them) would still have merit at that point.<p>


<li><strong>Buying An Initial Public Offering At The Offer Price: </strong>Studies indicate that buying an IPO at the offering price produces above-market risk-adjusted returns, while buying a new offering after it begins trading in the market is more likely to produce negative returns. Unfortunately, these findings are more useful for institutional investors than for individual investors, since most IPOs are offered first to a dealer's largest clients, who quickly snap up the best offers, leaving behind those that are less desirable. If you can get a new offering at the offering price, you probably shouldn't buy it; if you can't get it at the offer price, wait a year or so before you buy it in the secondary market if it still has any appeal.<p>


<li><strong>Buying Stocks Using A Value Approach: </strong>While value investors are not all alike in their selection of measures of value, their emphasis is consistent. They do not want to pay much for historical values such as earnings, dividends, or assets. Using the value approach usually creates lower risk portfolios that tend to shine in uncertain and down markets. <p>


The tools of the value approach are familiar--low price to earnings, low price to book value, low price to cash flow per share, above average dividend yield, low debt to equity, and high return on equity. The trick is to adjust these measures for unique firm and standard industry conditions to avoid false readings.<p>


Value investing as an approach has had consistent long-term success over widely varying economic and market environments, but tends to fall behind other approaches on occasion, particularly in the strongest portion of a bull market.<p>


<li><strong>Investing In Stocks With Price Momentum: </strong>The key to momentum investing is to buy price movement--If the stock's price is moving significantly upward, jump on and ride it until the road starts to flatten out and be quick to jump off when momentum falters.<p>


Momentum investing at its purest is simply a technical approach that relies on measures such as relative strength and moving averages. Relative strength is the price of an individual stock relative to some index base of the overall market; the more positive the relative strength trend, the more attractive the stock. Moving averages relate a stock's current price to its average price over some period; stocks with current prices moving above their moving average in an upward trend are attractive on a momentum basis. <p>


While much research indicates that technical indicators fail to provide above-market returns after transaction costs, certain momentum measures have occasionally been shown to work. However, these studies also indicate that short-term trading is required to succeed.<p>
</ul>

The common themes that research studies have repeatedly uncovered:<p>

<ul>
<li>Markets tend to overreact to news. Good news--news better than expected--draws and holds market attention; bad news--news worse than expected--is not soon forgotten.<p>


<li>Markets consistently ignore or neglect small stocks, creating the potential for excess returns.<p>


<li>Value investing is contrarian in nature, and is advantageous when markets overreact to events or choose to ignore worthwhile investment opportunities.<p>
</ul>

Thus, beyond understanding the mechanics and terms of investing, simply getting a feel for how markets tend to react or overreact to new information and situations is invaluable.<p>

<STRONG>Computer Basics for Investing and Portfolio Management - Part I </STRONG><BR>
By John Bajkowski<p>

<UL><LI>Personal computers continue to drop in price even while their computing power increases.
<LI> Investment software is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, yet easier to use.
<LI> Information services have grown in depth and breadth of investment information while making the retrieval of this data more affordable and simple.</UL>

These developments have put powerful investment tools in the hands of individuals. Now may be the time to look at using a computer to help you in the investment process. These powerful tools make it easier to keep investment records, plan to achieve financial goals, track portfolio performance, gather investment data, evaluate and select securities, and execute trades electronically with a discount broker.<P>
This article is an introduction to computerized investing, and is divided into two parts. This issue provides an overview of the area, and focuses on personal finance and portfolio management programs. In the next issue, I will focus on investment analysis programs. <P>
<HR>

<STRONG>Getting Started</STRONG><P>


Before you run out and purchase a computer, first gain a broad understanding of how computer systems operate. Closely examine your needs and objectives, which will have a bearing on the best system for you. <P>


Computers have largely become commodity items sold next to TVs at appliance centers. But no matter what the ads and salesmen say, computers are complex machines that take time and effort to learn how to use. <P>


It's best to think of a computer as a system that is composed of three parts-the hardware, the software, and the data. All three elements must be in place before you can do anything useful with a personal computer. <P>


As its name implies, hardware consists of the physical components such as the processor, keyboard, monitor and disk drives. <P>


Software consists of the operating instructions that tell your computer hardware what to do. Without it, the computer would sit idly, doing little except drawing electricity. Software tends to be very computer-specific. If a software program was written for a Macintosh computer, it will not run on an IBM without modification. <P>


The data is the information that your computer and software programs manipulate. This data can be entered manually or, in some cases, electronically by obtaining information from an information service. <P>

<HR>

<STRONG>When Selecting Hardware, Pick Software First</STRONG><P>


Software is the pivotal element of the three computer components. It will determine the type of hardware required to execute the software and the type of data that can be manipulated, along with the data source. Yet, when it comes to acquiring these components, people often take the wrong approach. They buy the hardware before finding out whether any software is available that will enable them to accomplish the tasks they have in mind. <P>


The table below illustrates the availability of investment software for IBM and Macintosh systems, the two most popular hardware types. This table, from AAII's annual "Individual Investor's Guide to Computerized Investing," clearly illustrates that IBM computers and their various clones have a significant edge over other types of computers when it comes to the amount of investment software. <P>

*Includes software in other categories as well as the four mentioned. Some programs fall into more than one category.<BR>
**Preliminary information from 1994 Edition. <P>

Does this mean that you have to buy an IBM-compatible computer? No, but be prepared to select from a smaller pool of investment software if you don't. That may mean that you have to settle for a program that may not fully meet your needs, and you may have to pay more for software because of a less-competitive marketplace. <P>


By using a resource directory such as the "Individual Investor's Guide to Computerized Investing," you can locate software that will satisfy your needs. From this base, you can determine the type of computer hardware system you should be shopping for. <P>

For instance, in using the guide, you may find that if you are interested primarily in technical analysis, the availability of software is such that you can shop for either an IBM or a Macintosh. But if you are looking for a broad, disk-based fundamental screening program, you may have to lean toward the IBM camp. <P>

When it comes to buying a computer system for personal use, it makes sense to purchase the most powerful system you can comfortably afford. It is an amazing computer fact that no matter what kind of system you purchase, you will wish that it were faster and had more memory and additional storage space a few months down the line. Also be prepared to deal with the notion that soon after you purchase your hardware, it will be available at a lower price. <P>

The software selection will also dictate the type of information service that can be used. Almost all programs will allow data to be entered manually, but some of the better software programs will have built-in routines to automatically access data you specify. <P>

Data retrieval routines must be written specifically for each electronic data service, so most programs will link up to a limited number of databases. Before finalizing your software selection, be sure to check with the data services supported by the software to make sure they are cost competitive and provide all of the data you need. <P>
<HR>

<STRONG>Investment Software</STRONG><P>

Hundreds of investment software programs are available that perform a wide variety of analysis on a broad range of security types. <P>

Nearly 80% of AAII members using a personal computer for investing look toward a personal finance and portfolio management program to assist them in the investment process. It is easy to see why this category is so popular. Keeping track of your securities, their cost basis, their current value, and their performance can be a time-consuming and tedious process. A computer can help you automate the process, giving you time to concentrate on your overall investment strategy and security analysis, not to mention your golf game. <P>

Personal finance and portfolio management software comes in many flavors. At one end of the spectrum are the personal finance programs that look at your complete financial picture. At the other end of the spectrum are portfolio management programs that help you dissect your investment portfolio with surgical precision. <P>

Personal finance programs can be thought of as the Swiss Army knife of the investment software arena. These programs offer modules that assist in budgeting, checkbook management, retirement planning, mortgage and loan analysis, tax planning, and net worth tracking. Some programs even go as far as to offer word processing and appointment management. These are mass-marketed programs that are not written with investors specifically in mind. However, over the last few years, increased competition has led to general personal finance programs with portfolio management modules that satisfy the need of the average investor. <P>

These programs are suited for the individual who wants to use the personal computer to get a grip on their financial situation. Some of the programs like Quicken and Andrew Tobias' Managing Your Money offer built-in checkbook management that not only allow you to print checks via printer, but also allow you to send checks electronically. These programs also allow you to establish budgets and track how well you meet your objectives, and more importantly, help you track how you and your household spend money. <P>

Personal finance programs offer differing levels of financial goal-setting tools. WealthBuilder by Money Magazine takes you through the steps of establishing your current position to planning for specific financial goals and looking at those factors that might prevent you from achieving those goals. <P>

Tracking assets is a fundamental part of these programs. However, the type of assets tracked varies greatly among them. Some provide great flexibility in tracking both financial and real assets and liabilities, allowing you to basically inventory everything you own. Other programs concentrate on liquid, easily priced financial assets, while still others ignore this area totally. <P>

Some programs now offer the built-in ability to access on-line services and update the prices on the securities in your portfolio. WealthBuilder goes so far as to offer the Smart Investor option, which includes items such as quotes, news, mutual fund data, fundamental and technical stock data, and bond data. <P>

Like most portfolio management programs, personal finance programs can track the cost basis of each of your investments; produce year-end capital gain, interest income, and dividend income reports; allow you to price your current portfolio; and provide at least some basic asset class breakdowns of your portfolio. <P>

If you are considering a personal finance program, keep in mind that they were not written with only investors in mind. They may not compute rates of return on your portfolio, and they may not be able to handle all types of securities and transactions. On the positive side, because they are geared toward the mass market, they have many users. This critical mass means that you can buy the software at a computer store or mail-order vendor instead of dealing with the manufacturer directly. You can also find books to assist you in using the program, and it is easier to find other computer users to help you when you have a problem. <P>

Personal finance programs are not for everyone. Some individuals find that a standard paper and pen checkbook register is just fine and they have no need to enter and track all their assets. For these individuals, stand-alone portfolio management programs are the way to go. However, if you feel that your financial program has no focus or that you cannot keep track of where all your income is going, personal finance programs may prove useful. The key to success is determining which features will be useful to you and finding a program strong in those areas. <P>

<HR>
<STRONG>Portfolio Management Programs</STRONG><P>

Moving from the general personal finance program to stand-alone portfolio management software is like going from your family doctor to a specialist. These programs were written specifically to help investors monitor their investment portfolios. This single-task focus allows the program to cover the subject in much more detail. <P>

In comparison with personal finance programs, portfolio management programs will typically handle a wider variety of securities and types of transactions, allow you to track more than one portfolio, update your portfolio through an on-line service, alert you if a security's price hits some predetermined price level, and provide detailed reports on your portfolio. You could expect the program to produce an accurate rate of return for both your securities and your portfolio, track security and portfolio betas and dividend yields, produce a calendar listing maturity dates of bonds, options and futures along with expected dividend amounts and payment dates, provide a breakdown of the industries and asset classes of your securities, and include a flexible cost basis determination procedure. <P>

Portfolio management programs offered by discount brokers such as Charles Schwab and Fidelity even allow you to place brokerage orders on-line and receive additional discounts for doing so. <P>

Of course all of this added flexibility comes at a cost - learning to use all the features will take time. <P>

Do not expect to go to a computer store to try out the various stand-alone portfolio managers. Like most investment-specific programs, portfolio management products make up only a small segment of the overall software market. To buy these programs, you will have to deal directly with the manufacturer. <P>

When selecting portfolio management software, choose carefully. The start-up cost in terms of the time needed to enter the historical purchase information for all of your securities can be quite high. Be sure the program satisfies your current and future needs. Most manufacturers offer demonstration disks of their programs, so be sure to ask to see them before you make your final purchase. If no demo is available, ask for copies of all of the reports produced by the program and check on the firm's return policy - some companies set time limits or charge restocking fees for returned programs. <P>

Also try talking to other investors. Many AAII local chapters have special interest groups that focus on computerized investing. The AAII publication Computerized Investing lists these groups, along with their activities, in each issue. If you already own a computer, communications software, and a modem, you can connect with computerized bulletin board systems (BBS) to get others' opinions. The AAII operates a BBS that can be reached by computer at (312) 280-8565. There is no cost to use this system beyond any standard telephone charges incurred. <P>

If used effectively, a personal finance or portfolio management program will free you of some of the drudgery involved in keeping track of your finances. The table below provides a sampling of the available software for these two areas. <P>

<A HREF="cibasic2.html">Part II </A>of this article will investigate how you can use some of that time to locate and analyze securities with a computer. <P>

<STRONG>A comparison of FOX vs. StreetSmart</STRONG><BR>

Reviewed by Paul D. Garverick<P>

StreetSmart
by Charles Schwab<P>

Fidelity Online Xpress
by Fidelity Investments<P>


As America rushes to get on-line to do everything, two major forces in personal investing have created an on-line resource for individuals. Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments both offer services that give users the ability to trade, track, and do research for their investment portfolio on-line. <P>

StreetSmart and Fidelity On-line Xpress (FOX) both offer the ability to directly access account information, including positions and values. Also, real time quotes and research information are available through tie-ins to the brokerage houses, and Telescan, S&P MarketScope, and Dow Jones News/Retrieval databases. <P>

Who would want these electronic tie- ins to do stock trading? Of the 75% of AAII members who are computer users, half of that group subscribe to an on-line service and use it regularly, which creates a large group of potential investors who would want to place trades and do research all with one program. All three major on-line services (America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy) offer their subscribers the ability to research stocks and place trades through on-line brokerage houses. It seems like a natural fit that a brokerage company would like to offer their members direct access without going through another service provider. </P>


<STRONG>Setup</STRONG>
<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT ><P>

Of the two programs, it's easier to start with Fidelity On-line Xpress. While the installation of StreetSmart is quick (one disk) and the screen is nice to look at (it is a Windows program), the changes made to your computer are sometimes tough to remove. Both programs include ample documentation including quick start guides, brokerage information, fully documented manuals, and ample and friendly technical support personnel. The StreetSmart documentation can sometimes be confusing because there are three different books-I was never sure which one I should be looking in for a particular answer. <P>

In setting up the programs, each user needs to enter some basic information to initiate contact. StreetSmart uses the CompuServe network providing local access numbers to most every person in the U.S. and Canada, as well as baud rates up to 14400 bps. FOX operates through the TYMNET network, which provides the same local access and several international numbers; however, the program limits you to a maximum speed of 9600 bps. <P>

FOX requires a local access number, the communications port your modem occupies, and your Social Security number. Enter those three items and the program handles the rest. FOX will initiate the call and access all of your Fidelity holdings, including mutual funds and brokerage accounts. The Fidelity network provides account balances, number of shares held, and a history of transactions, for all securities. StreetSmart can provide the same information, except the history of transactions, but users need to request each piece separately. Transactions are available on StreetSmart, but only for the past 30 days. If you are an infrequent trader or trying to compile a yearly list of transactions, StreetSmart will not be able to provide all the transactions you require. <P>

Since StreetSmart is a Windows program, there are other areas where the setup is made easier. StreetSmart will utilize your existing mouse and printer drivers from Windows so there is no need for some of the setup routines required in FOX. <P>


<STRONG>Basics</STRONG>
<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT ><P>
Retrieving quotes and placing orders will be the basic forms of usage for the two programs. One benefit of using the electronic interface is a discount on trading commissions. Both Fidelity and Schwab offer 10% off their regular commission charges for all orders placed electronically. On the sample trades that I placed, Schwab's commission fees were lower on all three trades, but the trades were on high-volume/high-priced stocks-the test was not performed across the full spectrum of stocks. <P>

In addition to trading discounts, both brokerages offer real-time quotes. Quotes are allotted on a soft dollar basis, meaning that you gain more quotes for every trade you execute with the system. Fidelity is a slightly more complicated system in that the quotes are allotted by calls. <P>

Fidelity On-line Xpress customers are allotted five calls in the beginning. One call can retrieve up to 50 quotes, which would put them on equal footing with Schwab, which offers 100 free quotes. Fidelity offers additional calls based on the frequency of your trading. Quarterly traders executing one to four trades per year receive five additional calls per transaction. Monthly traders executing five to 12 orders per year receive 20 more calls for each order. Weekly traders who execute 13 to 52 transactions per year will notch 40 more calls per trade, and anyone trading more than 52 times per year receives 60 additional calls per trade. <P>

Schwab is easier to figure out in that every trade receives an additional 100 quotes. New Schwab accounts receive 100 quotes and new StreetSmart users gain an additional 100 real-time quotes. If you use your quote allotment with either service you can still get 15-minute delayed quotes through Dow Jones News/Retrieval, at their rate. <P>

Quotes can be retrieved with both programs either in groups or separately. FOX allows users to set up named quote lists that contain equities, mutual funds, options, bonds, indexes, or market digest indicators. Schwab prices one main quote list at a time that can contain stocks, options, mutual funds or several indexes that are included as choices in the program. Figure 3 illustrates a quote list from each program. A group of quotes and an expanded single quote (Figure 4) from each program show similar basic data as well as unique elements for each specific program. <P>

Retrieving the quotes from each program has its own unique steps. StreetSmart stores a list of securities and indexes that are available to choose immediately. If you want to use an existing list of quotes from previous sessions the retrieval process is quick. Simply choose the securities you want to price and click the button labeled "Get Quotes." However, if you want quotes on a new security you need to go through a process of creating a quote list where you must add the security to your potential list. <P>

To add a security on Fidelity's program you need to create a list first. A quote list will speed the process of pricing the same group of securities often. When you add a security in FOX you have the option of using either a ticker symbol or name and letting FOX look up the ticker symbol. This is a useful feature for securities like bonds where you may not know the ticker symbol. <P>

Both StreetSmart and FOX allow users to store retrieved quotes and export the data to other programs. This is a valuable feature for people who do not have another data source or want to use their existing quotes in another program. Fidelity and StreetSmart both export in a comma-delimited format. <P>


<STRONG>Trading</STRONG>
<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT ><P>

The Fidelity and Schwab brokerage houses have always attempted to be the full-service discount brokers, so the introduction of their on-line trading software was greatly anticipated. The main reason to buy software such as this seems to be the avoidance of any human contact in your investment process. With StreetSmart and FOX you can now screen a universe of stocks in the Dow Jones News/Retrieval gateway, retrieve a price chart history directly from Schwab or through Telescan on Fidelity, download a company summary report, get a real-time quote, and finally place your trade and receive a confirmation on-line. <P>

This process has come full circle in that the full-service discount brokers have now made individual investors into a kind of broker for themselves. There is no need to call your friend the stock broker and ask him what's hot today. You simply find it yourself. Some investors might enjoy this control; certainly an on-line broker gives you the option to ignore calls from your broker since you can place trades by yourself. <P>

StreetSmart has greater flexibility in placing orders on-line. Schwab has included the ability to place fill or kill, all or none, stop-limit contingency orders, and short-sales;  FOX users are not given these options. Both programs allow margin purchases and access to the mutual fund network. Purchases can be made from any fund in the Schwab fund network. Fidelity allows mutual fund exchanges, which cuts out a transaction from StreetSmart's program. Fidelity customers can directly exchange shares or set a dollar amount in one fund to match the same amount in another fund. <P>

Both programs offer the convenient flexibility to place your orders off-line then check them over before transmitting them to be executed. A complete menu of trading possibilities must be completed before sending the order to be executed. StreetSmart provides additional feedback to ensure proper order execution. Both programs also provide the flexibility to enter orders or transactions from other brokers into your portfolio account. You can track accounts like CDs, real estate, or stamp collections. When tracking these accounts, the programs act like stand-alone portfolio management programs. <P>

FOX features a menu selection to record non-Fidelity transactions, but StreetSmart requires a little maneuvering to add transactions manually. Since StreetSmart can only download 30 days worth of transactions, a menu choice exists to fill in the missing download periods. Users must manually enter every position that cannot be downloaded. The menus of StreetSmart offer about 20 investment choices as preset selections. The FOX account holding non-Fidelity investments can be classified as taxable, non-taxable (IRA/Keogh), or hypothetical to practice trading skills. <P>

In terms of overall usefulness, StreetSmart provides a much more useful and understandable menu for placing and executing trades. The buttons to pick are laid out well and all of your possible choices are presented as pre-programmed menu items. Figure 5 on p. 10 presents StreetSmart's screen choices when placing orders and a sample order confirmation screen. <P>


<STRONG>Additional Research</STRONG>
<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT ><P>

Before you start trading on-line, you might want to do some research on prospective investments. Fidelity and Schwab have created gateway access to other data services for this purpose. Both programs can access Dow Jones News/Retrieval and S&P MarketScope data. Fidelity offers a tie-in to Telescan data service [reviewed by Mark Fister in the March/April 1994 issue of CI]. <P>

As a bonus to new FOX users, Telescan is offering a 30-day free trial to users who dial in through the Fidelity link. Telescan offers expanded information sources, the ability to screen a broad universe of securities on both technical and fundamental data items, and technical analysis features. <P>

Schwab users can retrieve a detailed company report on over 6,700 companies compiled from sources like Standard & Poor's, Market Guide, Inc., and Zack's. New StreetSmart users receive one company report free, but subsequent reports cost $4.50 each. <P>

FOX users also can access data directly from Fidelity. Users can retrieve a historical performance evaluation on all Fidelity funds as well as information on other Fidelity accounts. These fund reports are free of charge excluding your on-line time to retrieve them. <P>


<STRONG>Unique Features</STRONG>
<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT ><P>

While FOX and StreetSmart have many similar features, there are unique items that distinguish the programs from each other. <P>

Fidelity On-line Xpress has an asset analyzer feature that enables users to track the performance of their assets either on an individual or group basis. FOX analyzes assets on a tax-lot basis, which means every purchase is allocated a specific lot that remains independent of the group of assets. This is useful in analyzing capital gains holding periods and finding a basis for shares owned. <P>

An analysis of a tax lot for a particular mutual fund can show reinvested gains on originally purchased shares. Select either all the tax lots associated with one fund to measure overall performance of your investment or select one specific purchase price lot to see the performance over a specified period. <P>

StreetSmart offers graphing capabilities for the securities you are tracking. Several graph types are available including: price history, asset allocation, return on investment, and realized/unrealized gains and losses. Color graphs can be created and printed from StreetSmart. StreetSmart utilizes the prices that you have retrieved through the regular quote service, so that if you are tracking a stock on a regular basis you can use those prices in more than one section of the program. <P>

Reporting on your holdings is slightly different with each program. FOX calls them security details reports while StreetSmart calls them views. Both programs can create a Schedule D customized gain and loss report. Users are able to customize reports or views in each program and the details can be arranged in similar fashion. <P>


<STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG>
<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT ><P>

I found both programs to be extremely easy to set up and use. Both provided quick access to accounts held at either Schwab or Fidelity. While both programs provide useful information and some further analysis, for serious investors, rather than just trackers, the programs do not go deep enough. Tracking your investments through a direct link provides an easy way to keep up to date on your security holdings. This may be all that some investors need, but those looking for in-depth research and analysis will not be satisfied with these programs solely. <P>

Since StreetSmart has a graphing capability, there is additional utility in using this program. Also, I found StreetSmart easier to use than Fidelity On-line Xpress because of the Windows layout. Fidelity promises a Windows setup for FOX in early 1995, but until then there is only the DOS version, which hindered me when trying to force it into a Windows environment. StreetSmart has refined their Windows version to a 1.0c and has just released a Macintosh version. <P>

Overall, I found both programs very useful in providing basic account transactions, balances, and price quotes. Tying into other data services is a good feature, but these are premium services that cost extra. StreetSmart stands out as the more polished performer with a broader array of features. Fidelity, however, provides a complete transaction history for every security associated with your accounts. <P>

I felt more at ease placing trades on StreetSmart because of the multiple checks and easy selection, but Fidelity offers greater flexibility for mutual fund transactions. I would recommend buying FOX if you have a Fidelity account and buying StreetSmart if you trade with Schwab. Both continue to expand their offers of no transaction fees on over 200 mutual funds each and access to purchase over 800 funds. <P>

The discount broker and the mutual fund giant have proven again why they are the service leaders in the brokerage industry. You won't be disappointed with the performance of these programs; however, if you don't have an account with either company, Schwab has the current edge with their Windows and Mac software. <P>

<h2 align=center>Quicken Financial Planner</h2>
<hr>

<strong>Reviewed by Michael Gutierrez</strong><p>

One new product not covered in the comparison that has generated inquiries from many of our members is the new Quicken Financial Planner produced by Intuit. This Windows-based CD-ROM product is priced at a reasonable $39.95 and is unique in that it is a stand-alone product that can directly link with its parent product, Quicken. This allows you to extract detailed information such as your individual investments and loan information. Not only do you save time, but you can also track your investments in greater detail using Quicken.<p>

Like Quicken Deluxe on CD-ROM, the Financial Planner includes multimedia tutorials on asset allocation, the advantages of starting a retirement plan early, the advantages of tax-deferred versus taxable investing, and the differences between investing in cash, bonds,  and stocks. In addition to the multimedia tutorial from Jane Bryant Quinn, there are help buttons in every folder of the program to provide assistance or insight on topics you reference.<p>

The multimedia tutorials provide the user with solid fundamentals on planning for retirement. Ms. Quinn competently describes different basic investment strategies that a user might need in the various stages of life. She is also quite helpful in describing the impact of different retirement years on Social Security benefits. These tutorials are an excellent addition to the program, providing needed information that might not otherwise be easily obtained.<p>

The program visually resembles a handheld planner with tabs separating each category, and sub-tabs defining the individual steps taken in each category. It opens with a short introduction and takes you through entering personal as well as spousal information, which is, of course, optional (see <A HREF="fig1.gif">Figure 1</A>).<p>


<h3>Taxes and Inflation</h3>

In this area, you detail your tax and inflation concerns. Both pre- and post-retirement tax rates are entered, in addition to an expected inflation rate. Estimates of your average tax rate as determined by demographics are provided by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based tax research organization. A graph depicting the trend in inflation over the last 68 years is also included for your perusal, in addition to an assumed average inflation rate of 4%, which may be modified by the user.<p>


<h3>Assets</h3>

The program breaks down your total assets into three categories: home, investments, and special assets. Your investments can be any stock, bond, mutual fund, or cash equivalent invested in either a taxable or tax-deferred account. The data may be entered directly, or imported from Quicken.<p>

Although the program allows you to enter your investment information, it is not meant to be a portfolio management tool. This type of function would be found in the regular Quicken product. In the Quicken Financial Planner, you simply enter the total value of your individual investments. A field is provided for you to enter the purchase price (or cost) of your investment, but the program will not produce any performance reports or provide you with a percent gain figure. However,  this information is not necessary and the lump-sum information entered is more than adequate when using this data for retirement planning.<p>

The home section factors in your primary residence, in addition to its planned sale or the purchase of another home for living or income.<p>

The special assets section is for assets that you currently own and are willing to sell to fund your retirement (excluding real estate, but including cars, boats, etc.).<p>

Specific tax-deferred and taxable savings other than investments are entered separately in the Planned Savings section.<p>


<h3>Loans</h3>

Next, you enter your loan information. Again, this information may be imported from Quicken or entered by hand. Information of this type would include loans for college tuition and vehicle purchases.<p>

This topic does not include a multimedia presentation. However, it offers a page of useful information about borrowing versus paying cash. It also provides many useful hints about debt consolidation, margin loans, borrowing against your home or life insurance policy, and credit card debt, which are helpful for those who have a good deal of outstanding debt they want to control.<p>


<h3>Income</h3>

Income can be entered on an individual basis or for both you and your spouse. Anticipated future changes in salary may be entered to compensate for an expected job change or promotion. One time inflows of money can be entered in the special income section, in addition to other taxable incomes such as rents or fund distributions.<p>

A multimedia presentation describing the intricacies of salary growth and making realistic projections is provided, along with a wealth of information on gifts, inheritances, and other unusual incomes. Tax considerations are also considered in regard to these topics.<p>

Incomes will automatically increase by the inflation rate.<p>


<h3>Expenses</h3>

Expenses can be entered either in a lump-sum figure, or in a list of itemized expenditures. Twenty-five predefined variables are included, with the ability to create as many new ones as necessary. (These can also be imported from Quicken.)<p>

Modifications can be made to living expenses both before and after retirement, making it easy for the user to see how expenses may differ in retirement. Depending on your situation, many of your expenses will be rearranged after retirement. For example, you may sell your home and purchase a condominium, which will alter your mortgage payments, or your costs of clothing may go down while vacation costs may increase, etc.<p>

One-time outflows of money can be entered in the special expenses section (such as a vacation) in addition to multiple expenditures (such as college tuition payments).<p>

For those living beyond their means or suffering from debt overload, Ms. Quinn provides some very helpful savings tips, such as consolidating credit card debt into a home equity loan at a lower percentage rate; or utilizing the automatic investment feature of mutual funds to augment savings.<p>


<h3>Retirement Benefits</h3>

To record the Social Security benefits of you and your spouse, you can enter a rough estimate (with default values provided), or obtain an estimate from the Social Security Administration (a request form is provided with the program).<p>

If you need a copy of your earnings and benefits statement, it can be obtained from the Social Security Administration by calling (800) 772-1213, or by writing to: SSA, Wilkes Barre Data Operations Center, P.O. Box 7004, Wilkes Barre, Penn. 18767-7004. These benefits can be adjusted if you believe the amount will grow more slowly in the future or eventually be reduced.<p>

Pension plan benefits for both you and your spouse can also be estimated.<p>


<h3>Planned Returns</h3>

Next, you need to determine both your pre- and post-retirement investment rates of returns historical and projected figures are provided for whatever return you expect to have. A far more accurate method for accomplishing this would have been to enter the expected returns for each investment on an individual basis. At this point, the program will only accept a lump-sum rate of return on all investments in all categories (tax-exempt, tax-deferred, and taxable).<p>

I might add here that the program does not provide for the entry of a tax-exempt status, just taxable and tax-deferred. To get around this, you can enter tax-exempt investments under special assets in the assets table.<p>


<h3>Results</h3>

Once all information is entered, the results of your retirement plan will be presented in both graphical and numerical report format. You may view these for cash flow, income, expenses, savings, withdrawal, portfolio, and net worth in either today's dollars or dollars at retirement (see <A HREF="fig2.gif">Figure 2</A>).<p>

If you find that you do not have enough funds to see your way through retirement, there is an adjustments page that allows you to change several different variables and see the impact it has on your retirement income. Factors include inflation, retirement age, life expectancy, and percent contributions to tax-deferred and taxable savings. The returns on these investments are presented for modification.<p>

A thermometer bar provides a graphical depiction of your investments at retirement, and a numerical amount specified in today's dollars is also given.<p>


<h3>Action Plan</h3>

The action plan section provides a detailed plan for your savings that is necessary to make your retirement plan work. Also provided is a breakdown of your investments (both taxable and tax-deferred) as they currently stand, in addition to a rebalancing of these investments provided by the program.<p>

This rebalancing is broken down into domestic bonds, domestic stocks, global bonds, and international stocks. The results are displayed in both a pie chart and tabular format.<p>

Another presentation provided by Ms. Quinn stresses the importance of starting your savings plan as soon as possible and to sticking to your plan once it is implemented.<p>


<h3>Other Extras</h3>

A nice feature that has been integrated into the programs is the mutual fund data provided by Morningstar (see <A HREF="fig3.gif">Figure 3</A>s). Performance data on over 4,400 mutual funds is included on a year-to-date, one-year, three-year, five-year, and 10-year basis, including returns in comparative indexes such as the S&P 500 and categories of funds such as domestic stock and international stock.<p>

Risk and ratings, fees and expenses, investment style, and general information about the funds are also included. Bar graphs encompassing a 10-year time frame are provided for individual funds, comparing them to appropriate benchmarks on either yearly or cumulative returns. A second graph shows if a fund ranks in the top 25%, 50%, or 75% of all funds by return.<p>

Another nice feature is that in places where numerical values are expected to be entered by the user, an on-screen keypad is provided for easier data entry.<p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The program is very easy to use and includes many helpful tips. It even provides a high degree of flexibility that other programs do not. For instance, you can specify an early retirement, but choose not to collect Social Security until a later date. Furthermore, the separate and individual workspaces for information on you and your spouse enable you to make real-life situations easier to calculate, such as if your spouse was out of work for an extended period of time and recently got a new job.<p>

Although the program did describe the effects of early retirement (before 65) and late retirement (after 72) it does not provide a warning for the user that benefits will be reduced. It is therefore a good idea to go through the tutorials and help sections (even if you are familiar with a topic) in every folder. Not only will this help clarify the many different facets of retirement planning, but it will also provide you with useful and significant information for making the most of the program.<p>

What should you do if your retirement benefit calculations put you right on the border? It might be tempting to say, "Well, we'll just earn more income in these next few years," or "We'll assume that there will be no inflation for these next few years." However, it is important that the changes you make in the assumptions table and the "what-if" analysis section are valid assumptions or even worst-case scenarios. Earning more income or an above market rate of return sounds easier than it really is, and it is highly doubtful that the inflation rate will drop much below the 4% level, let alone down to zero. Remember to manipulate variables that are within your power to change, such as cutting back on some of those expensive dinners or (terrible as it may seem) retiring a year or two later.<p>

<STRONG>Computer Basics for Investing and Portfolio Management - Part II</STRONG><BR>
By John Bajkowski<P>

In today's fast-paced investment world, people are increasingly turning toward computers for assistance in the investment decision process. Part 1 of this series examined how computers can help users with basic recordkeeping, budgeting, financial planning and portfolio management. This article will explore the avenues of actually putting a computer to work locating and analyzing stocks through fundamental and technical analysis. <P>

<HR>
<STRONG>Fundamental Screening</STRONG><P>


Fundamental analysis refers to the process of selecting stocks based upon underlying economic trends and long-term expectations of future company performance. The crucial variable in fundamental analysis revolves around projected growth in factors such as sales, cash flow, earnings and dividends. Software for fundamental analysis is usually broken down into two categories - screening and valuation. Screening refers to the act of searching through a large universe of securities to locate a few that might hold promise and warrant further analysis. Valuation, on the other hand, refers to taking one company and applying a series of valuation models to determine if the current price can be considered fair. <P>


Screening should be familiar to readers of the AAII Journal's Shadow Stock articles. It was the availability of economical electronic databases that first allowed AAII to come up with the Shadow Stock list and allows us to apply and test various screening techniques on a continuing basis. The Shadow Stock series also highlights the limitations of fundamental screening - even after a screen is applied and the list of stocks is narrowed down, further analysis is required. Screening represents only the first step in locating potentially attractive companies. <P>


Screening dictates that the search process starts with a broad universe of companies. It is not practical to enter this data by hand, so investors must either acquire the complete database and store it on their computer for screening or dial up to another computer and have it perform the screen and return only the results of the screen. <P>


In comparing stock screening services, critical factors include: the universe of stocks supported by the database, the depth of stock information, the flexibility of screening software, the frequency of updates, distribution methods, computer system support, and price. The screening services listed in the table following this article vary widely in the number of stocks tracked, from the 1,600 stocks tracked by Value Line to the 7,500 NYSE, Amex, Nasdaq National Market, and Nasdaq Small Cap listed stocks found in AAII's Stock Investor. When contemplating a data vendor, consider the types of companies that you are trying to find. If your focus is only on larger, more established companies, then Value Line's 1,600 company coverage may not be a limitation. However, if you are seeking smaller, less-followed firms, look for a service that covers a wider range of stocks. <P>


Screening services vary in the depth of stock information they provide. Some services, such as Smart Investor/WealthBuilder and Value/Screen III, provide a fewer number of variables for each company and depend more on summary statistics such as growth rates when providing background data. Other services, such as MarketBase and Stock Investor, provide both summary statistics and the raw year-by-year or quarterly data behind these numbers. In considering a data service, look not only at the number of variables but also specifically at which statistics are provided. Value/Screen III allows you to screen companies based upon Value Line's rankings and projected growth rates, which may be more important for some investors than a complete database. Telescan's ProSearch program is the only service that combines both fundamental and technical factors for screening. Before settling on a service, obtain a listing of available screening variables to determine if the program will support those variables you find important. <P>


<HR>
<STRONG>Software Flexibility</STRONG><P>


The next consideration in selecting a screening service is the flexibility of the screening software. Screening services that distribute a complete database to the user and then allow you to manipulate the data tend to offer more flexibility than strictly dial-up services. For example, products such as MarketBase, Stock Investor and Value/Screen III allow users to combine existing fields to create custom variables. Look for flexibility in creating screening criteria. <P>


The method of data updating may play a role in selecting a vendor. Smart Investor/WealthBuilder or Value/Screen III, give you the option of updating your complete database either by mailed diskettes or by downloading the data via phone lines. Other services, such as Stock Investor, only offer diskette updates via mail. The pure on-line vendors will always require a phone call to perform a screen. Screening or downloading a complete database via phone lines may add significantly to the cost of operating the program, depending on telephone charges. <P>


The frequency of the data updates must also be considered. On-line services typically update their database on a daily or weekly basis. If the complete database resides on your computer, then you must select a delivery schedule, which will determine the annual cost. Options vary from weekly updates to annual updates. Expect to pay anywhere from $100 to over $2,000 per year, depending upon how frequently you update and who supplies the data. <P>


<HR>
<STRONG>On-Line vs. Disks</STRONG><P>


For investors who plan to perform screens infrequently or can limit their analysis to after-hours access, on-line services offer a good alternative to disk-based services. With these on-line services, you do not acquire the complete database. Instead, using your computer, you dial up to another computer that contains the database, input the screening criteria and retrieve the list of companies that pass the screen, along with some of their financial data. Investors using a dial-up screening service have the advantage of being able to access a large universe at the start of the screening process, using up-to-date data. In return for this, users may give up some of the detailed company information provided by the complete database vendors and the ability to create custom variables. Infrequent users can opt for a pay-as-you-go option in which you typically pay for initiating the screening process, pay a unit fee for each company that passed the screen, and pay for the per-minute connect fees that the on-line services charge. Under such a situation expect to pay between $5 to $20 per screening session. Alternatively, more of the on-line services are offering a flat-rate option in which users pay a standard monthly charge for unlimited access. Prodigy offers Strategic Investor for $15 per month, which allows unlimited access to stock and mutual databases with wide security coverage. Limited custom screening, however, is a weakness with this service. Telescan ProSearch offers a good balance of wide company coverage, a variety of screening variables, flexible screening options, and integrated software. Telescan also offers a variety of pricing options ranging from a pay-as-you-use option to unlimited screening with different prices for prime-time or non-prime-time access. <P>


Before settling on a screening system, make sure that the service is adequate in terms of the number of companies covered and the type of data provided for each company. Also look at the flexibility of the screening program, with an eye toward being able to apply those criteria that interest you. <P>


<HR>
<STRONG>Fundamental Valuation</STRONG><P>


Computers are well-suited to fundamental screening, but weak when it comes to assisting in fundamental valuation. This is because so much of the valuation rests on your personal growth forecasts for the economy, a company's industry, and the company itself. There are, however, a few programs that can assist investors with fundamental stock valuation. At one end of the spectrum are the macroeconomic forecasting programs that make overall economic projections that, in turn, drive fundamental valuation models analyzing individual companies. Macro*World Investor is typical of these programs. It costs $899.95 and requires frequent data updates, which cost $39/month after the first year. But even at that price, any valuation produced by such a product requires careful analysis by the user. <P>


At the other end of the spectrum are the programs that have compiled a series of valuation models that examine factors such as price-earnings ratios, dividend yields, earnings and sales growth rates and apply models such as the dividend discount or relative price-earnings ratio model. Entering the appropriate historical information along with your projected growth rates will enable these programs to return valuation estimates. These programs are typically spreadsheet templates originally designed to run in programs such as Lotus 1-2-3 or Excel, and some of the programs require that you own a compatible spreadsheet. Other products, such as FinVal, have been converted to run all by themselves, but most require that the user have a working knowledge of spreadsheet operation to make use of the program. In selecting and using these programs, remember that it is your judgment that drives the valuation. They can, however, provide you with a consistent framework in which to do an analysis. Look at the valuation models supplied by the programs along with the ease of operation and data entry. <P>
<HR>

<STRONG>Technical Analysis</STRONG><P>


Technical analysis covers a variety of techniques that study relationships between a stock's past price and volume movements and patterns to forecast security and market price direction. Typically, these patterns are charted. Technical analysis is well-suited to computerization. It involves the manipulation of a large amount of data. Technical analysis software allows investors to quickly obtain data and plot it, applying various technical indicators such as moving averages. The better programs also allow investors to test the success of various strategies on historical data (backtesting). What once would have taken many hours, if not days, can now be accomplished in minutes. <P>
 

Technical analysis programs require a great deal of price and volume data, which makes manual data entry tedious and error-prone. When selecting a program, closely examine the product to see if it supports automatic data retrieval and find out exactly which data source the program uses. If you plan to track a large number of securities, first make sure that the supported data services offer both the historical and current quotes on the types of securities you plan to analyze, and that the rates charged are reasonable. The price on a single quote can range from under one cent to over five cents. Alternatively, some services, such as Dial/Data, offer flat-rate access and various downloading capabilities at set prices. If you are planning on building up a large database, the differences in data acquisition costs will have an impact on the cost of operating the program. Also make sure that any data the software collects can be easily transferred for use in other software programs - if you should change programs or work with more than one program, your investment in the data will not be lost. <P>


Technical analysis programs vary widely in the types of indicators they provide. They may emphasize the analysis of a particular market or security type and provide those indicators most suited for that type of analysis. The Technician by Equis is geared for the analysis of the overall direction of the market and contains a different set of indicators than its sibling program MetaStock, which is a more general technical analysis tool. Look for programs that allow you to define your own indicators and perform backtesting. In using a technical analysis program, there is still a lot of judgment involved in the process. You must determine the appropriate indicator to apply to particular securities and investment horizons and how to correctly interpret it. Stay away from "black box" programs that have some secret formula for picking stock market moves. It is easy to optimize a set of rules to work over a historical time period; most, however, will not work in today's market environment. If you are interested in a program that includes pre-defined rules, look for one that discloses the factors currently driving its decision process. <P>


<HR>
<STRONG>Computerized Investing Tips</STRONG><P>


The computer can be a very useful tool for the investor. The table at the end of this article provides you with a list of some of the programs that are more popular with our members. Before selecting a program, keep these items in mind:
- Ask for a demo version of the product. If one is not available, get a brochure and make sure that you can return the product if you are not satisfied. Some vendors offer a full refund, others charge a restocking fee, while still others will not refund your money at all. Understand the return policy before you buy the product, not after.
- Look at the support policies of the company: Do they offer telephone support and, if so, when is it available? Some vendors charge for providing help. Some may operate a bulletin board system (BBS in computer lingo) or forum that you can connect to - not only to solve problems, but also to get operating tips.
<UL><LI>If you are purchasing via mail order, it is best to do so with a credit card. If you have problems either receiving the product or getting it to work, then you have some recourse. The Fair Credit Billing Act gives you some power to withhold payment on items purchased if you have made a good faith effort to provide the seller with an opportunity to correct any problems.
<LI> Most importantly, try talking to other investors. Attend a local chapter meeting; log onto a BBS that focuses on investments, such as the no-cost system operated by the AAII (BBS number 312/280-8565). Most on-line services have investment special interest forums, which, like a BBS, allow users to read and leave electronic messages with other users.</UL><P>


In using and selecting an investment program, keep in mind that the computer is only a tool to aid the user in the decision-making process. Just as buying a hammer will not make you a carpenter, buying a computer system and investment software will not make you a successful investor. <P>

It is your knowledge, aided by the information gathering and processing capabilities of a computer system, that will lead to success. <P>

</H2>
<hr>
<STRONG>by Howard Bandy</STRONG><P>

A neural network is a mathematical model that processes information and generates some form of response based upon the relationship or pattern identified within the data. Higher forms of life, such as humans, possess complex neural networks in the form of a nervous system. Neural networks also exist as computer-based systems. A neural network consists of a group of relatively simple units, called neurons, that work cooperatively toward solving complex tasks such as classification or prediction. <P>

This article, the first of two, addresses some of the basic issues faced when planning to develop a trading or forecasting system based upon a neural network. <P>

Investors typically build trading systems by developing a strategy around one or more areas, such as fundamental or technical analysis. The points covered in this article apply equally to any underlying area whether the system uses fundamental data, technical data, relative performance data, or a combination of the three. <P>

Several decisions need to be made before the neural network model (or, for that matter, any other type of model) is designed. First, you need to select which market to trade stocks, bonds, mutual funds, options, or futures. You then select the time frame for trading, whether intra-day; short-term positions, with decisions made intra-day; short-term positions, with decisions made after the market close; intermediate-term positions, with decisions made after the market close; or long-term positions of months to years. The trading style is the third decision to make. You might choose to be invested most of the time and use the model to determine which alternative has the most potential. Or you may prefer timing buy, hold, and sell signals for a specific issue. A third option might be to identify situations that occur infrequently, but that have very high reward-to-risk ratios. <P>

Each decision will result in unique requirements for network design, data collection, trading system signal generation, and trading system operation. <P>


<STRONG>Neural Network Basics</STRONG><P>

The basic processing unit of a neural network is the neuron (or node). Each neuron receives input(s), sometimes along with feedback, and produces an output signal(s). Figure 3 illustrates a typical, but somewhat simplified, neural network used to model a financial time series. <P>

A neural network typically has several layers. The input layer contains a neuron corresponding to each input (independent) variable. The output layer contains a neuron for each variable being predicted (dependent variable). While it is possible for a single neural network to predict more than one thing, it is usually better to design a network with exactly one output neuron. <P>

The hidden layer contains neurons that are connected to both the input layer and the output layer. It is possible for a neural network to contain multiple hidden layers, but a three-layer network will be adequate for most financial forecasting applications. <P>

The development of a neural network model has three basic steps. First, a portion of the historical data available is processed by the neural network modeling tools as they search for and learn the general relationships among the variables. Next, a (usually different) portion of the historical data is tested to see how well the relationships hold. Finally, the network is used to generate investment signals from current data. <P>


<STRONG>Defining the Relationship</STRONG><P>

A neural network is a mathematical model of the relationships between a dependent variable (output) and several independent variables (inputs). Conceptually, there are two categories of relationships: functional relationships and statistical relationships. <P>

Functional relationships refer to those relationships that are based on well-defined principles. For example, when modeling the production flow at a chemical manufacturing facility, the laws of chemistry and physics define the underlying process. <P>

Statistical relationships are not based on well-defined principles. They are instead based upon sets of data that exhibit different degrees of variation. Most financial relationships are of the statistical type. <P>

A key difference between these two types of relationships is the degree to which variations around the predicted outcome will be observed. Functional relationships tend to have a low degree of variation, whereas statistical relationships tend to have a much larger degree of variation. <P>

Creating a neural network model consists of making many guesses about the underlying real-world relationship, then testing to see if the guess is sufficiently accurate or profitable. One implication of the statistical nature of financial relationships is that it will be difficult or impossible to know when the best model has been found. The dynamic nature of financial relationships also complicates the statistical modeling since market relationships can change over time. <P>

Design issues include the definition of what is to be predicted (the dependent variable) as well as the determination of which inputs (independent variables) will be used to make the prediction. These two areas should be defined as precisely as possible. For example, the dependent variable might be defined as the percentage change in the price of the OEX cash index over a one-week period of time, and the independent variables might be defined as including each of the past five days' values of the 15-day slow stochastic indicator of closing price. <P>

If possible, all variables, independent and dependent, should be expressed in dimensionless terms. For example, use the price-to-earnings ratio, which is a dimensionless number, rather than earnings, which has the dimension of dollars. Also, changes are usually better expressed as percentages than as differences. <P>

In defining the dependent variable to be predicted, I recommend that it be continuous (such as percentage of price change) rather than discrete (such as buy, hold, sell). Discrete variables, which can be arranged in a rank order, can sometimes be coded in such a way that they can be treated as continuous variables. For example, buy, hold, sell could be translated to +1, 0, -1. Be careful, however, with discrete variables that do not have rank order. For example, the days of the week usually cannot be translated to 1, 2, ..., 7. <P>

It is easier to forecast the change in a moving average of daily closing prices than to forecast the change in raw daily closing prices. However, the signals that result from forecasting the change in a moving average will need to be carefully tested against the actual trading prices to see if the signaled trades are profitable. <P>


<STRONG>Testing for Profitability</STRONG><P>

Many investors exploring neural networks already have a trading system of some kind that works for them. After becoming familiar with the neural network tools, it's a good idea to model a system that you know works. This approach has several major advantages. First, you already understand the system its inputs, its outputs, some of its interrelationships, and the feel it has in given situations. Second, the system is known to work, so you can concentrate on implementing the neural network version. Third, the rate of return under realistic conditions is known, so there is a benchmark against which to measure. <P>

Early in the design phase, consider how you will evaluate the model. Obtain from a vendor, or create in a spreadsheet or programming language, a profitability test routine. Assume for a moment that the model will be perfect in predicting the dependent variable. Using realistic values for commissions and for slippage due to delay between signal generation and order execution, evaluate the profitability of the model. Examine the running balance of the equity, profit, and loss. Determine maximum drawdown, reward to risk ratios, number of consecutive losses, and other metrics that you find useful. <P>

Decide before proceeding any further if the results of trading this model are acceptable and consistent with your trading and investment plans. These results are the upper limit of profitability for this system and model. Because of the high amount of short-term variability in the price of the issue being traded, the correlation coefficient between the ideal output of the model and the typical neural net model will probably be less than 0.50, and the associated profitability will be much less than the upper limit. <P>

<STRONG>Organizing Input Data</STRONG><P>

End-of-day data will be sufficient for models used to trade all time frames except intra-day. Intra-day trading will require tick-by-tick or very short duration bars of series such as price, volume, and open interest of the issue being traded and also any of the intermarket variables which are being used. <P>

It is important that you use the same type of data for predicting as for training. For example, long-term market predictions may use economic indicators. If the model includes monthly housing starts, use initial release figures for both training and prediction, do not use final revisions for training and initial releases for prediction. <P>

Accuracy and consistency are equally important. Visually check both the data as it occurs in time order and its distribution. Examine and verify or correct any anomalies. <P>

The time period being modeled is limited to the period that has valid data for all independent variables. If most of the data starts in 1989, but one particular item begins in 1991, then you have three choices. One, collect the missing data for that one item. Two, drop the variable with the short data from the set of independent variables. Three, begin everything from 1991. Do not extend the short data set backward with simulated or constant data. <P>

If futures contracts are being used, pay careful attention to the transition periods that occur when contracts expire. Either the model must be very carefully designed, or a continuous contract must be created. <P>

Create historical data files to be used in model building. There will be a lot of data for each model. It will be helpful to create a separate disk directory for each model, and keep all related data and network files in that directory. <P>

As necessary, convert data reported at longer intervals (say, monthly) and shorter intervals (say, daily) to the interval length which will be used in the model (say, weekly). Arrange all data in time sequence and verify that all variables have exactly the same number of data points and that all dates agree. There must be no extra or missing values. Also verify that each observation (row) represents a set of data that would be available at the same time. <P>


<STRONG>The Numbers Issue</STRONG><P>

How many data points should you use? The short answer is as many as possible. The longer answer requires a bit of analysis and a word of caution. Before any modeling runs begin, the historical data must be partitioned into three data sets. A suggested approach is to partition the data as follows: 60% for training the model, 20% for testing the model periodically during training, and 20% for verifying the model with out-of-sample data. This last set is sometimes called the production data set. <P>

During the training of the neural network, the data in the training set will be thoroughly examined and the network will learn or generalize the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. At intervals, either under the control of the network development system (the program) or of the developer (you), the partially trained network will be presented with the independent variables in the test set and will make predictions of the dependent variable, which is known. The goodness of fit of the predictions will be measured. Based upon the fit, modifications to the network might be made and training continued using the training set. The fact that the test set was examined (perhaps many times) before the model reached its final state implies that the test set is partially incorporated into the training set. <P>

Consequently, a final test of the finished network is made using the production data set. The production set should include at least one block of data longer than the prediction period. If, for example, the model predicts five days ahead, the production data set might include one or more 10-day periods. Providing that the goodness of fit on these periods is adequate, then the model might be useful. If not, further modifications to the model will be required, as will a new production data set. <P>

Think of the total number of input neurons plus hidden neurons as similar to the number of degrees of freedom in a regression model. By keeping this total low relative to the number of observations in the data set, you reduce the likelihood that the model will memorize a relationship. <P>

Since it is difficult to know specifically which variables will be important (statistically significant), there is a tendency to create a lot of independent variables and let the network sort them out. Just as in regression analysis, when the number of independent variables (columns of inputs) becomes large relative to the number of observations (rows of data in the training set), the fit for the training set increases and the memorization of details dominates the generalization. Try to have at least 10 to 20 times as many observations in the training set as the total number of input neurons plus hidden neurons. <P>

Two issues come into play in determining how many data points one should have: completeness of data and proper time frame. Data must be organized such that a balance exists between these two aspects. <P>

On the one hand, try to gather as many observations into the training set as possible so that the model is not overfit to the data. The training set should include instances of the entire range of possible observations that are anticipated in the future. For example, in order to have the model signal an upcoming situation similar to October 1987, there must be observations similar to that period in the training set. Another example would be if the network models asset allocation throughout periods of economic expansion and contraction. In that case, there must be data representing at least one (and preferably more) full cycle. <P>

On the other hand, too much data might lead the network to reach the wrong conclusion. If the relationship being modeled changes as time passes, older observations contribute nothing (or, worse, wrongly) to the model. In order for the modeling process to be successful, the underlying real-world relationship must hold for the entire period being modeled. <P>

A simple example will illustrate why this is true. Figure 4 shows a function of time that is a simple quadratic relation. But assume that the modeler does not know that. If the relationship is guessed to be linear, then the best straight line will be fit to the data being modeled. If all 200 data points are used, the line will not predict future price well. However, if only 20 or so data points are used, the straight line will be a reasonable approximation for a short time into the future. By sliding the 20-data-point window forward periodically, the linear guess is sufficient. If the relationship is guessed to be quadratic, then the model will fit all 200 data points and will not need to be retrained as long as the parameters of the quadratic function remain the same. <P>

There are some implications. In order to use many independent variables, there must be many observations so the model does not overfit the data. If many observations are used, the underlying relationship must remain unchanged. If that relationship is found, the model will be valid for a long period of time until something in the relationship changes. On the other hand, if the relationship is thought to change quickly, then the number of observations must cover a period of time no longer than the period over which the relationship can be profitably approximated. Limiting the number of observations limits the number of independent variables. And the guess regarding the relationship must be good. If the model approximates the underlying relationship for a short period of time, then it must be periodically retrained or rebuilt. <P>

Consider the following example to get a feel for the kind of numbers a network might incorporate. Assume the following: daily data will be used, with about 260 trading days in a year; the underlying relationship being modeled has not changed greatly in 10 years; the next few years will not differ greatly from the past 10 years; daily data for all variables is available for the past 10 years; and one of the independent variables will be a 200-day moving average. <P>

The total data set consists of 2,600 observations. Reserving the first 200 to initialize the moving average leaves 2,400 to partition into training, test, and production sets of 1,440, 480, and 480, respectively. The production set could be a single block of the most recent 22 months, or it could be selected, scattered blocks. The test set could also be either a single block or scattered smaller blocks (as small as a single day). <P>

If the number of observations in the training set should be 10 to 20 times the total number of neurons, about 70 to 140 neurons can be safely used. Assuming they are in the ratio of I : 2 x (SQRT I) : 1 for input layer, hidden layer, and output layer, respectively, where I is the number of input neurons, the number of neurons in the input layer can be up to about 55 to 115. <P>


<STRONG>Transforming & Preprocessing the Data</STRONG><P>

Neural networks rarely process raw data. The raw data typically must be transformed before giving it to the network. The purpose of a transformation is to increase the usefulness of the information contained in the time series being transformed. Typical transformations include calculating various ratios, smoothing the series by computing moving averages, scaling, and normalizing. <P>

It is helpful to plot and visually examine the distribution of each variable. If the distribution has outliers, they will strongly affect the model. Trimming the distribution so that outliers are brought toward the mean will usually improve the model. One way this can be accomplished is by calculating the mean and standard deviation of each variable, then creating a new variable whose upper and lower limits are some number of standard deviations from the mean. Values such as 1.50, 1.67, or 2.00 standard deviations are useful. Recall from statistics that 2 standard deviations plus or minus from the average include about 95% of the range of a normally distributed variable. Try several values and look at the resulting distributions. Figure 5 compares the untrimmed one-day percentage change in closing price of the S&P 500 with the same data trimmed to 1.67 standard deviations. Notice how all changes beyond 1.4% have been set to 1.4%. These observations still participate in the model as being days of large change, but they do not distort the model as they would if left untrimmed. <P>

Because of the manner in which they are calculated, some data series that always fall within a well-defined range are self-trimming and will not require further transformation. An example is the stochastic oscillator that always moves within a range of 0.0 to 1.0. When in doubt, create both versions and experiment. <P>

When creating transformations, be careful not to cheat. Neural networks are extremely good at detecting explicit relationships calculated into the transformed variables. For example, if price levels are used rather than percentage changes and simple moving averages are included as transformed variables and if the test data set consists of a random selection of observations, then the network will learn the relationship between the raw price and the average price. The fit on the training set and the short periods in the test set will be excellent, but the predictions for longer periods of unseen data will be poor. <P>

The process of imagining and creating transformations of time series is called preprocessing. The majority of the modeling effort is spent in this area. <P>


<STRONG>Summary</STRONG><P>

This article discussed about half of the issues pertaining to the development of neural network investment/trading systems. We have covered the basic structure of a neural network. The next issue of Computerized Investing will feature the second half of this series. It will cover topics including network design issues, network training, network validation, and actual implementation. <P>

<H2 ALIGN="center"> Developing A Neural Network System Part 2</H2>
<hr>
<STRONG>By Howard Bandy</STRONG><P>

This article is the second of a two-part discussion of the basics of using a neural network to build a financial forecasting system. <P>

The first part [see the July/August issue of Computerized Investing also on AOL] gave an overview of neural networks, emphasized the importance of carefully defining the forecast to be made and of having a method available for determining whether any given set of forecasts would be profitable. It also discussed the selection and preparation of data. This conclusion will continue discussion of the design of the forecasting model, measurement of the model's accuracy, and the transition from development of the model to its implementation. <P>

Neural networks are tools that can be used equally well with fundamental data (such as commodity prices, interest rates, profit margins, and market share) and technical data (such as share price relative to its moving average). They are particularly powerful for combining fundamental, technical, and inter-market factors together in a single model. In some ways, neural networks can be thought of as generalizations of regression analysis. <P>


<STRONG>Designing the Neural Network</STRONG><P>

There are many methods of implementing the internal workings of neural networks. Most programs give the user some control over some of the options such as the number of layers to use and the number of neurons in each hidden layer. See Figure 1, a reprint from Part 1 of this series, for a depiction of what a typical network looks like. <P>

Determining the optimal number of layers and hidden neurons will require some trial and error. For most applications, one hidden layer is sufficient. The network requires enough hidden neurons to learn the general features of the relationship. With too many hidden neurons, it will begin to learn idiosyncrasies in the training set and will predict the test set poorly; with too few, it will fail to learn the general features and will fail to train on the training set. The goal is to use as few neurons in the hidden layer as possible while still retaining the network's ability to learn the relationships among the data. <P>

Assuming that there is only one output neuron, experience suggests to begin by setting the number of hidden layer neurons to the square root of the number of input layer neurons. If the model fails to train, increase the number of hidden layer neurons and try again. If the model trains well and validates poorly, decrease the number of hidden layer neurons and try again (the process of training and validation are explained later in this article). When the model trains well and validates well, you have found the right number. If the model is successful, it will probably not be extremely sensitive to the number of hidden neurons. For example, if the model works well with 12 hidden neurons, it will probably also work nearly as well with 10, 11, 13, or 14. <P>

If you cannot get the model to both train well and validate well, then either additional (or different) independent variables are needed, or the dependent variable cannot be modeled (as would be the case if it were random). <P>

It is popularly thought that neural networks can be presented with large amounts of data in many independent data streams and that the networks will determine what is important and ignore the rest. I have found that, in modeling financial time series, neural networks often perform poorly when given too many extraneous independent variables. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to determine which variables are important and which are not. Consequently, it is difficult to prune out unnecessary input variables in order to make room for others. And, since cross-variable interactions are often important, it is difficult to test blocks of variables. <P>


<STRONG>Training the Model</STRONG><P>

During the training process, the goodness of fit between the actual target output and the value predicted by the network is measured. Recall from the previous article that the training is an iterative process incorporating both the training set and the test set. The neural net uses the training set of data, the first 60% of the time series, to learn the relationships between the input variables and the output variable. The goodness of fit is measured by running the model against both the training set and the test set, the next 20% of data in the time series. The information resulting from this process is used to guide the process of modifying the model and repeating the training process until a successful model is found. <P>

The goodness of fit can be judged from several different perspectives. Depending on your trading system, you may want the model to give the lowest average error or you may want the model to give the most conservative worst error. Which of these is best can be determined only later by testing the trading signals that result from the model. To begin with, tell the neural network development system to minimize mean square error. Stop training after either the error in the training set is minimum or the error in the test set has reached a minimum and begun to increase the stopping criteria will depend in part upon the options provided by the program. <P>


<STRONG>Validating the Model</STRONG><P>

After the model successfully learns the training set and predicts the test set, apply it to the production set (the last 20% of data in the time series) and measure the goodness of fit for this set. This process is referred to as validation. <P>

The validation step is extremely important. The key point in this step is to compare the goodness of fit that results for each of the three data sets. <P>

Look at the three data sets separately. If a functional relationship among the independent and dependent variables exists, as it might in a chemical manufacturing process, the three will be similar in correlation and in scatter plot. With very noisy data, such as financial data, expect the training set to have the best fit, the testing set next best, and the production set the worst fit. <P>

Three quick and dirty methods can be used for judging the goodness of fit. The first is to compare the mean square error reported by the program as it processes each of the three data sets. The second is to compare the correlation between the network prediction and the associated target value (the known point that the network is trying to model) for each of the three data sets. <P>

The third is to create a scatter plot for each data set. Plot the neural network prediction along the horizontal axis and the associated target value along the vertical axis (see Figure 2). Perfect learning (a perfect fit) will be indicated by all the points falling on a line running from lower left to upper right, while no learning (a random fit) will be indicated by the points being distributed in a circular cloud. The more likely result is partial learning, which will be indicated by a well formed ellipse. <P>

The next decision about the model's goodness of fit will probably be based on the model's success in predicting the production set. Choosing a production set that includes a block of recent data enables the modeler to verify the current validity of the trading signals and equates to traditional paper trading of a new system. <P>

Unlike regression models, it will be difficult to determine what the functional relationship is among the independent variables in any neural network. Some neural network tools allow the weights associated with connections between neurons to be displayed. Relatively large (positive or negative) weights correspond to relatively important contributions. But the neural network modeling process is inherently non-linear, so straightforward interpretation of the weights or of the relationship, particularly related to the hidden neurons, is difficult. Worse, from the point of personal understanding, two versions of the same model that result from different starting points in the modeling process may have very different weight sets, yet both may give accurate predictions. <P>


<STRONG>Examining the Bottom Line</STRONG><P>

The ultimate goodness of fit indictor is the bottom line in the trading account. It is important that you evaluate the risk and reward aspects of a neural trading model. Take the values predicted by the model and use some set of profit and loss testing tools to perform this analysis. Unfortunately most software for developing neural network models lack adequate profit and loss testing tools, so you might have to use a spreadsheet or separate program to accomplish this task. <P>

The buy and sell prices used in the evaluation of the model should be those that will be used in actual trading. If the model predicts the percentage change in net asset value of a mutual fund one week ahead and if signals are computed over the weekend using Friday's closing data, then the buy and sell price will probably be Monday's close. Using Friday's closing prices as the trading price will probably give an inaccurate result. Try using both prices and compare if there is a big difference, it might be worthwhile to develop a procedure to anticipate signals, then trade on Friday. <P>

You need to quantify the reward and risk for making trading decisions based upon the model's predicted values for the dependent variable. Include realistic provisions for commissions and slippage (slippage is the cost of buying at the offer price and selling at the bid price or somewhere in between). Compare the bottom line obtained from this system with alternatives such as money market only, buy-and-hold, other trading systems. <P>


<STRONG>Creating an Operational System</STRONG><P>

After the model has been successfully developed, it must be made operational it must be set up to give useful trading signals. That is, it must be integrated with whatever system is used for data acquisition. <P>

In operation, data must be gathered and processed with the same frequency as signals will be generated. If end-of-day signals will be generated, data can be collected after the markets close, converted into the necessary storage formats, and processed by programs or spreadsheets to compute a new observation (row) with the same transformed variables used in building the model. <P>

A prediction module that examines the newly created row of inputs is then called to produce a prediction, and the prediction interpreted into a trading signal. If intra-day signals will be generated, all of this processing must take place in real time. <P>

If the neural network is being used with fundamental data or technical data that is gathered less frequently (such as monthly or quarterly profitability figures) there is less urgency, but the important point remains that the operation of a neural network model will be quite different than its development. <P>

At the current time, neural network programs seem to fall into three categories regarding on-going operations: <P>

- Stand-alone programs that require all transformations be made externally by whatever method the user prefers. Fully transformed data is imported into the neural network development program, which is run to give a prediction. These programs are adequate only for systems that are run very infrequently. <P>

- Spreadsheet add-ins. Raw data is imported into a spreadsheet, transformations take place in the spreadsheet, and the prediction is displayed in a spreadsheet cell. These can be used for systems that use end-of-day information to generate signals daily or less frequently. To be useful, be sure there is a way to automatically gather data and place it in the correct cells of the spreadsheet. <P>

- Neural networks, which could be either of the first two types for the development phase, that generate a programming language subroutine (typically BASIC or C), which is incorporated into a production system. The production system contains modules necessary to gather data, transform data, call the neural model for an evaluation, and postprocess to result in a trading signal. Custom programming is required to create a complete trading system. These systems can be used real-time or end-of-day data and can be automated. <P>

For further information about how to select neural network programs, see my recent article in the NeuroVe$t Journal, Thoughts on Desirable Features for a Neural Network-Based Financial Trading System (P. O. Box 764, Haymarket, Va. 22069, 703/754-0696). The article includes discussion of features of stand-alone neural network products versus spreadsheet add-ins. <P>


<STRONG>Retraining the Model</STRONG><P>

The neural network model needs to be retrained periodically. The frequency of this retraining depends on the ongoing agreement between the predictions made by the model and the target being modeled. <P>

If the training set includes several years and the model predicts well for production sets of several months, then retraining will be necessary only a few times a year. On the other hand, if the model predicts well only a short time beyond the prediction period, then frequent retraining will be necessary. <P>

The retraining process is essentially the same as the model development process, but it should be easier because the previous model establishes  a good starting point. <P>


<STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG><P>

Do neural networks work for financial forecasting? Yes. Is it easy? No. Is there help available? Very little. Are  development tools adequate? Barely. Are the production tools adequate? Not yet. <P>

Should you try it? Maybe. Remember that neural networks are more analysis tools than direct solutions. If you do try it, expect to spend a lot of time in the development phase locating data, thinking up transformations, transforming data, training the model, and testing the model. When you finally get your first model that works, expect to spend a lot of time generating signals downloading raw data, performing transformations, referencing the neural prediction module either by hand or writing the programs to perform these tasks automatically. Developing your second model will be easier, partially because you know the general procedure and partially because portions of the first model will be reusable. Signal generation from your second model will be easier only if you developed programs with the first model. <P>

Each tradable issue and time frame combination needs its own model. The models can be very large, so you'll need a lot of computer power. Based on the assumption that there will be 40 independent variables, there will need to be 1,000 to 2,000 rows of data. A spreadsheet to store and manipulate this will be several megabytes. And there will be several versions of the model, each with its own spreadsheet. Model development is computationally very intensive an 80386 or equivalent is the minimum processor required. <P>

What tools should you use? Along with some very high quality programs, there are some widely advertised, expensive, but (from the perspective of financial forecasting) very poor neural network programs. Before committing to an expensive product, get either a limited capability, lower-cost, trial version or negotiate a trial period with a written, money-back guarantee.

<H2 ALIGN="center"> A Worksheet for Evaluating Stocks</H2>
<hr>
<STRONG>By John Bajkowski</STRONG><P>

Fundamental stock valuation is a basic process performed by many of our members. While computerized tools exist to screen on fundamental factors for potential candidates, the number of computerized programs that assist in the valuation process remains small. <P>

The AAII Journal started a Stock Investing Basics series in January of this year, which focuses on an aspect of stock valuation each month. Computerized Investing will accompany the series by developing a fundamental valuation spreadsheet template. The AAII Journal will present the basic valuation models, the theory behind the models, and walk readers through the process of basic valuation. We will take the models, add a few bells and whistles, and produce a valuation spreadsheet template. <P>

The February 1994 AAII Journal presents a valuation worksheet that relies on historical average price-earnings ratios and dividend yields to arrive at a range of valuations for a security. Figures 1 and 2 on the following pages present a template that takes this worksheet and expands the model to include valuations based upon historical average multiples of price to sales, price to cash flow and price to book value. Adding additional valuation techniques does not necessarily lead to a better valuation; all of these valuations are basically helping to identify firms trading at prices that deviate from their historical norms. Different models enable you to analyze a larger range of company situations. For example, a dividend valuation will not work with a company that pays no dividends and a price-earnings approach fails when a company reports negative earnings. <P>

<STRONG>Using the Spreadsheet</STRONG><P>

The valuation spreadsheet is divided into four main sections. Cells that require user input are shaded. The very top contains basic company data such as the name, ticker, exchange and current stock data. The S&P 500 index data is entered and analyzed between rows 12 and 26. I used two sources for this S&P data--S&P Outlook, which provides a current and projected look at the earnings and dividends, and S&P Security Price Index Record from its Statistical Service, which provides a historical look at the S&P indexes. The data entered for the S&P 500 is much more detailed than that used in the AAII Journal article. We will use this data in a future issue to develop a valuation model that looks at the security multiples relative to the market multiples. <P>

The raw company data is located in rows 29 through 35 and row 55. I used Value Line as the source for this data, which is a good choice for widely followed companies. S&P produces Corporate Reports (also know as tear sheets), which would cover a wider range of companies. Computerized databases such as MarketBase and Stock Investor could also be used, but would require some work on your part to convert the data to a per share format. <P>

Columns J through L contain areas for estimating next year figures used in the valuations in Figure 2. Column J extends the most recent year's data assuming that it grows at the five-year growth rate. Columns K and L allow you to enter either your own estimates or estimates by other services such as Value Line. <P>

Figure 2 displays the various valuations based upon the stock data entered in Figure 1. In future issues we will expand on these valuation techniques and explain their uses and limitations in greater detail. <P>

<STRONG>Setting Up the Spreadsheet</STRONG><P>

The formulas for the spreadsheet, which we have named VAL1, are found on page 6. Note that the labels for the spreadsheet will have to be entered from Figures 1 and 2. The formulas presented are for Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows. Formula adjustments are presented for earlier versions of Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Excel. Earlier releases of Lotus 1-2-3 have traditionally treated cells containing labels as cells with a zero value. This treatment throws off functions such as counts and averages. In Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows, users can now mix numbers and labels in a range and get an accurate result. Microsoft Excel has always given users the option of how to treat labels in numerical functions. <P>

The VAL1 spreadsheet is in the software library under the fundamental analysis. <P>

<H2 ALIGN="center"> Fundamental Valuation: Revising the worksheet </H2>
<hr>
<STRONG>By John Bajkowski</STRONG><P>

The March/April issue of Computerized Investing included a stock valuation spreadsheet template based upon the fundamental valuation worksheet that Maria Crawford Scott and I used in the Stock Investing Basics series currently running in the AAII Journal. This worksheet, which I called VAL1, relied on historical multiples of price to sales, price to cash flow, price to earnings, price to book value, and dividend to price coupled with next year's estimates to arrive at a range of valuations for a stock.<P>

In this issue a second valuation spreadsheet template, VAL2, is presented. It builds upon its predecessor to offer an expanded number of financial ratios, a value-to-price comparison ratio for a quick comparison of a valuation relative to the current stock price, two valuation models that relate company multiples to market multiples, and additional areas for a user to test out assumptions and perform sensitivity analysis. <P>


<STRONG>Using the Spreadsheet</STRONG><P>


As before, the spreadsheet is divided into four main areas - current stock and market data (Figure 1), historical market data (Figure 1), historical stock data (Figure 1), and valuations (Figures 2 and 3). Cells that require user input are shaded in the figures. <P>


The top section of Figure 1 contains current data for both the stock under analysis and the market. This area contains basic information such as date of the analysis, company name, ticker, exchange, current price, and beta. The area labeled Current Stock Data uses trailing 12-month figures for every factor except dividends per share (DPS) to compute the current market multiples. The indicated dividend is used for the dividend per share figure. The indicated dividend is a rough approximation of the expected annual dividend. For a company paying dividends quarterly, it is computed by multiplying the latest dividend payment by four. These market multiples are ratios that compare a company's financial data element, such as earnings per share, to the stock price, which is set by the market. <P>


The Current Market Data (S&P 500) section is new to the spreadsheet and comes into use with the price-earnings (P/E) relative and dividend yield relative models. The S&P Outlook was used as the source for the current earnings and dividend figures. P/E ratios and dividend yields for the market can generally be found in section C of the Monday Wall Street Journal. The Barron's Stock Market Laboratory in the Market Week section provides current earnings, dividends and book value for the market. Note that the book value figure reported in Barron's tends to be slightly dated. In its May 2 edition, Barron's was reporting 1991 and 1992 book value figures. <P>


<STRONG>S&P 500 Market Data Section</STRONG><P>


The market data section of the spreadsheet provides a historical perspective of the market needed for the market relative valuations. The first addition you may notice from VAL1 is the source of the data in cell B12. Variations in data reporting exist between different data services, so it is a good idea to get into the habit of indicating its source. If you should have some questions about the data at a later point in time or share the spreadsheet with someone else, the original data can be more easily referenced. <P>


Another addition made to this section is the market close figure for each of the last five years. VAL1 relied on the high and low price along with an average between the two to calculate the various market multiples. The close was added to replace the average and provide an indication of the market (or stock) at a specific point in time. When you see that the high for the S&P 500 in 1991 is the same as the close, then you know that the year closed on a strong point. <P>


When entering the formulas you may also notice that the five-year growth rates have become more complicated. Previously the formula worked only when the item under consideration had a positive value both five years ago and for the most recent year. Through a series of nested if/then statements, the growth rate formula was adjusted to deal with a wider range of possibilities. <P>


The final modification to the market data section was to provide space to enter personal P/E estimates and dividend yield estimates. These estimates allow you to play what-if analyses with the valuations below. Room for the entry of similar company market multiple estimates was also allotted in the stock data section. These estimates allow you to see the impact upon the stock valuation if the expected market multiple changes. Multiples reflect the expectations built into the price. For example, a high price-earnings ratio indicates that the market is willing to support a higher price in relation to current earnings per share because there is a high chance for even greater earnings per share in the future. Multiples adjust as the level of optimism for the market, industry, or company change. The ability to try various multiple estimates was provided in this section so that you can scan the historical multiples, examine past ranges, hopefully spot a trend, and input an expected future multiple. <P>


<STRONG>Stock Data Section</STRONG><P>


Data for Bristol-Myers Squibb is entered into the stock data section. This is the same company analyzed in the Stock Investing Basics article in the May AAII Journal. Readers comparing that worksheet with this may notice, however, that the data differs for certain items such as earnings per share. The differences arise from using different data sources that treat certain items differently. Here we used Stock Investor, AAII's fundamental database and stock screening program, as the primary source of stock data. Value Line was used as the data source in the AAII Journal article. Earnings per share figures for 1989, 1992, and 1993 differ because of the treatment of extraordinary losses Value Line excludes them from its primary data presentation. This discrepancy points up the desirability of using one data source for all of your comparative analysis and the importance of fully understanding that source's strengths and weaknesses. <P>


Three additional company data elements can now be entered - the annual price close, total assets per share and total liabilities per share. As previously discussed, the year-end close replaces the average price for the year. The total assets per share and total liabilities per share were added to provide input for some additional financial ratios. <P>


The new financial ratios include asset turnover, return on assets, total liabilities to total assets, total liabilities to equity, and sustainable growth. Return on assets (ROA) is a measure of profitability, as is return on equity (ROE) and profit margin. ROA measures how well management is using the assets of the firm to generate profits. One way to calculate return on assets is to multiply profit margin by asset turnover. In judging ROA it is helpful to look at these components: Management can increase ROA with higher profit margins or higher asset turnover. Profit margins are improved by lowering expenses relative to sales. Asset turnover can be improved by using assets more effectively selling more goods with a given level of assets. Like all financial ratios, these items should be examined over time to look for trends. Steadily increasing ROA ratios are considered positive. To determine if the ratios are high, they should be compared against industry norms. Relative to our drug stock example, a supermarket would be expected to have lower profit margins, but higher turnover. <P>


Return on equity (ROE) takes into consideration the impact of the firm's operating performance and its capital structure. ROE can be calculated by dividing ROA by the remainder of the total liabilities to total assets ratio subtracted from one. To increase ROE, a firm can increase its operating performance (ROA) or use greater financial leverage. Bristol-Myers has been able to increase its ROE from 14.8% to 32.8% over five years by boosting both its ROA and its level of debt. <P>


The sustainable growth rate was the final ratio added to VAL2. It measures the growth potential of the firm considering its profitability (ROE) and how much money is reinvested into the firm. It provides a baseline growth potential of the firm. To increase the sustainable growth, the firm must increase its ratio of earnings to equity or plow back more of the earnings into the firm instead of paying it out in the form of dividends. A negative figure as shown in 1989 for Bristol-Myers indicates that the firm is paying out more in dividends than it is earning, which will limit its future growth potential if continued for an extended period. Comparing the 1992 sustainable growth ratio of 7.9% to the five-year growth in earnings of 27.7% helps to show that this high level of growth cannot be sustained for long. The weakness with the earnings growth figure is that Bristol-Myers had extraordinary write-offs affecting earnings for both 1989 and 1993 leading to suspect historical growth rates. <P>


<STRONG>Valuation Estimates:<BR>
Average Multiple Models</STRONG><P>


The valuation estimates represent the heart of the spreadsheet and have undergone three primary changes to allow for greater sensitivity analysis and quicker comparisons to the current price. Models considering the average price have been replaced with models derived from the annual close price. The average price models simply provided the midpoint values between the high and low multiple models and did not provide as much insight as desirable. While the models based on the closing price will also fall between the high and low range models, they provide the ability to perform a valuation when only closing data is available. <P>


The value-to-price ratio was added to provide a quick snapshot of how the valuation compares to the current stock price. A ratio of 100% means that the valuation is equal to the current price, ratios above 100% indicate valuations above the current price, and ratios below 100% indicate valuations below the current price. A ratio of 150% indicates that the valuation is 50% above the current price. <P>


While VAL1 allowed you to vary the estimates for next year's figures, it did not provide for an easy way to vary the multiples and see the impact upon the valuation. VAL2 addresses that weakness by providing room to enter estimates for market multiples and perform even greater what-if analyses. With this capability you can measure the impact on price of a change in the market expectations for a company. <P>


<STRONG>Valuation Estimates:<BR>
Relative Market Multiple Models</STRONG><P>


Comparing the relationship of a stock to the market can reveal interesting information about a company beyond just looking at the company's historical market multiples. Based upon growth expectations, companies trade at multiples greater or smaller than that of the market. For example, one would expect companies with prospects better than the market as a whole to trade with higher multiples than that of the market. <P>


By dividing a company's multiple by that of the market's, a multiple relative is determined. VAL2 uses the P/E relative and dividend yield relative because it can be difficult to obtain other multiples for the market. <P>


The first step in using the model is to divide the company's multiple by the market's multiple. After determining the multiple relative, you must determine the expected market multiple and multiply it by the multiple relative to determine the adjusted company multiple. Applying the expected earnings or dividend figure for next year to this adjusted company multiple provides a valuation. <P>


Using the Bristol-Myers Squibb relative P/E valuation as an example, you can see that the market's opinion of the prospect of the company has trended down over time. Early on, the company commanded premiums above the market, but most recently it has been trading at a discount to the market. One key for determining the company's fair price is deciding if the market is correctly interpreting the company's prospects. The five-year average P/E relative for Bristol-Myers ranges from 1.24 to 1.38. Multiplying these P/E relatives by the current S&P P/E produces a range of adjusted P/Es from 25.5 to 28.4 roughly double the current P/E of 14.1. <P>


However, before you decide that a valuation based on this adjusted P/E is valid, you should consider whether the current S&P 500 P/E ratio of 20.6 is reasonable. If you expect the market       P/E to go down as earnings increase during the economic recovery, then a lower market P/E may be appropriate. The S&P Outlook is forecasting the earnings for the S&P 500 to increase to $29.17 by the end of this year. At the S&P price level, that would translate to a P/E of 15.5. Multiplying the 15.5 market P/E by the range of the company's P/E relatives results in adjusted company P/Es ranging from 19.2 to 21.3. Multiplying the range of projected company earnings by these P/Es results in the valuation range shown in rows 168 through 170, columns G, I, and K. The spreadsheet also allows you to input P/E relative estimates to check the sensitivity of this item on the valuation. <P>


Using a spreadsheet such as VAL2 has a number of benefits. It provides a consistent technique for examining a company and its relationship to the market. It helps to identify the factors driving the current market price and test various assumptions to arrive at a fair price. Stock valuation is not an easy process, as the valuation template presented here illustrates. However, performed effectively, it can be rewarding. <P>

<h2>On-Line Discount Brokers</h2>
<hr>

<strong>by Michael S. Gutierrez</strong><p>

The explosive growth of on-line services has impacted the on-line discount broker arena over the past year. The annual discount broker survey in the January issue of the AAII Journal shows a significant jump in the number of brokers providing on-line trading services (from a meager 12 in 1995, to 22 in 1996).<p>

This has not only enlarged the pool of brokers an investor can choose from, but it has also increased competition among them. For the individual, this translates into lower brokerage commissions and better service options.<p>

Although the average minimum price of commissions in the survey decreased only moderately from $36.29 to $35.33, the lowest minimum commission per trade decreased from $20 to $15, a rather substantial drop. Competition has also spurred the use of other tactics to conjure up more clientele namely, providing more investment-related information via your personal computer. Beyond trading capabilities, the on-line brokerage services also provide security price information, account information, and portfolio information. The comparison grid on the following pages details these services and the fees charged by the current crop of on-line brokers. We include 20 brokers in our comparison; Regal Discount and Unified Management Corporation, listed as on-line brokers in the AAII Journal, are restructuring their systems and were not able to provide any details about their services. <p>

The other trend in on-line brokers is the growth of Internet connections. Active traders can maintain a constant connection with their brokerage account via the Internet without fears of running up a large on-line tab. This allows quicker reaction and processing time when placing day trades. These Internet brokers also take advantage of resources available on the Internet to provide information from services such as PAWWS, QuoteCom, and NETworth. [PAWWS is a portfolio management system and was described in the September/October 1995 CI On the Internet column. QuoteCom and NETworth provide stock quotes and financial data; see the November/December 1995 CI Product Comparison for descriptions.]<p>


<h3>Modes of On-Line Service</h3>

The comparison grid covers the discount brokerage services that allow customers to trade on-line via their personal computer. Some provide proprietary software (like Schwab and Fidelity) for the interface, while others (like AccuTrade and Max Ule's TickerScreen) can be accessed with any communications software program. The latter act essentially the same way as an electronic bulletin board system (BBS). By simply dialing the provided number with a general purpose communications program and logging on to their system, you can access your account information and place trades. A third type of on-line broker is accessed via the Internet services like National Discount, Net Investor, and Aufhauser use this system. <p>


<h3>Securities Handled</h3>

Most of the on-line brokerages will allow you to trade the basic securities such as stocks and options, in addition to bonds, mutual funds, futures, and annuities. Commission structures vary for the different types of securities traded, so be sure to ask for a commissions schedule from any potential broker and review it carefully. <p>


<h3>Fee Structure</h3>

The fees for these services are broken down into several categories on-line fees, commissions, and fees for quotes. With software-based brokerage services, charges can include the cost of the software, long-distance phone bills, and connect-time fees. The services accessible by any personal computer with a modem can also incur fees such as a phone bill (if applicable) and connect time (again, if applicable). Since Internet service (depending on your provider) is not directly associated with the discount brokers, its cost is not included in the fee structure of the comparison grid However, keep this fee in mind when comparing the services. The fee for an Internet account varies, but is usually around $30/month. More detailed and extensive information, in addition to product reviews, can be found in the magazine Internet World, available at local bookstores.<p>


<h3>On-Line Fees</h3>

The on-line fees section details the type of costs that may be incurred when using an on-line broker. Start-up refers to the initial cost of setting up an account. This could be the cost of software needed, or simply a one-time start-up fee.<p>

Maintenance fees refer to any additional monthly charges a brokerage firm levies to connect to the broker, while access fees refer to additional charges that are accrued by the minute. Note that this does not include America Online, CompuServe, or Internet service fees, if you access information through one of these. <p>

Execution fees are extra charges for transactions placed electronically over and above the commission a broker charges.<p>

These are the primary fees associated with opening, accessing and maintaining an account. However, there can be numerous other fees associated with brokerage accounts, such as a fee for duplicate statements, or for obtaining your stock certificates. It is a good idea to thoroughly go through the fee structure of any prospective brokerage firm to ensure the elucidation of all expenses.<p>


<h3>Commission Schedule</h3>

In the commission samples, all price quotes are net of any discounts you may receive; any commission discount for on-line traders was not taken into account when the commission samples were calculated. Discounts are detailed in the row labeled commission discount for on-line trades, while extra fees are described in the row called on-line execution fees, as described above.<p>

The minimum amount for a no-load mutual fund purchase was calculated by figuring the associated commissions of purchasing one share at $1.<p>


<h3>Placing Orders</h3>

Most services will allow the basic trades such as a market order, stop order, and limit order to be placed on-line. <p>

The simplest order is the market order, which will be executed at the best available price. Before placing a trade, it is important to first examine the market price by looking at the last trade price and its time of execution, the current inside bid-ask spread, the size of these offers, and even the volume. While a market order offers you the quickest and surest way to accomplish a trade, it comes with the risk that a quickly moving or thinly traded market may lead to a poor execution price.<p>

A limit order reduces this transaction risk by setting the minimum price that an investor is willing to sell a security, or the maximum price that an investor is will to pay to purchase a security.<p>

Stop orders are also tied to market moves. While a limit order establishes a set price or better, stop order becomes a market order when a trade is filled at the stop price or better. The stop order will then be filled at the prevailing market price, with no guarantee of any specific price.<p>

Lengths of time can also be assigned to these orders, such as a day order (good through that day only), or good-till-canceled (which are usually good through the end of the month in which the transaction was placed.) <p>

A do not reduce order is an instruction not to automatically reduce a stop or limit order by the amount of the dividend when a stock goes ex-dividend.<p>

A versus purchase order allows you to specify which lots are being sold to limit your tax liability.<p>


<h3>Open Orders</h3>

In addition to placing a trade, it is also important to be able to change your mind and cancel trades or make modifications, if necessary. On-line brokerage firms offering this feature are denoted in the open orders section of the grid. <p>


<h3>Portfolio Information</h3>

Access to account information is a key benefit to on-line brokers. It is important to be able to see how much cash you have in your account to purchase new securities, in addition to viewing the securities you already own to prevent duplicate purchases.<p>

We further denote those on-line brokerages that provide a list of dividends received from your securities and a record of your account transactions.<p>


<h3>Quotes</h3>

Quotes can be a vital part of placing a trade. All services provide delayed quotes, while some offer quotes in real time. However, the quote structure is also important.<p>

We have broken down the quotes section by type of quotes. Bid/ask refers to the spread between the bid price and the ask price of the stock. Last trade denotes the price at which the security last traded. Volume is the total amount of shares that have exchanged hands for the security. The high/low price for the day in addition to the high/low of the year can help in determining a security's relative price standpoint. <p>

Some of the brokers charge for these quotes; if so, fees are identified in grid.<p>


<h3>Support</h3>

As a potential subscriber to these on-line brokerages, it is essential to call and request an information packet detailing their services and associated fees. However, pouring through the marketing literature brokerages send can be a time-consuming and sometimes frustrating process. Sometimes you will walk away knowing little or nothing of the brokerage's services, except that they have a corner on the sales-hype market. In my experience, the brokerage firms that are heavy on the hype are usually the ones that have poor customer support. <p>

In the comparison grid, we have rated the firms' printed brochures in a row called literature. Ratings range from * to *****, where * is lowest in quality of information and highest in the amount of marketing hype, and ***** signifies a well-organized and informative information packet, providing a detailed listing of the fee structure and services offered.<p>

Although price is a major consideration, it should not be your only concern when selecting an on-line discount brokerage firm. Another factor to weigh is the type of phone support you receive should you encounter any problems or have a question regarding your account or how to make transactions electronically. Since most of your trading and information gathering will be done on-line, you won't speak to representatives or brokers unless you have problems or questions. Therefore, it is important to have fast, friendly, and knowledgeable representatives that can assist in such matters.<p>

We have tried to denote those companies who were not only friendly, but also helpful in providing information about setting up an account and in answering general inquiries. We called each company three times, and our judgments can be found in the grid under telephone service. Note, however, that the questions we asked were not in regard to any individual account. We simply asked questions about setting up an account and what specific information the provider offered.<p>

<STRONG>Reviewed by Lyle Johnson</STRONG><P>

@BRAIN is a neural network development system for creating neural networks in the DOS release of Lotus 1-2-3 for both version 2.X and 3.X. It functions as an add-in to create, manage and run neural networks directly from worksheet cells. An add-in is a program that works with Lotus 1-2-3 to provide additional spreadsheet capabilities that are not included in the regular program. It works seamlessly and naturally with Lotus 1-2-3, and is powerful, fast, and easy to use for anyone who is comfortable with spreadsheets. <P>

Neural networks have received a lot of publicity recently with all the talk about being mathematical models that emulate the way a brain works. A more meaningful way to think of a neural network is as a statistical method of modeling non-linear relationships. A neural network is a complex form of regression that has the potential to provide an effective approach to a broad spectrum of applications. <P>

Neural networks are especially effective at modeling solutions to problems involving patterns, including situations where it is known that certain inputs are related to outputs, but it is difficult to predict the output with any certainty based on the input that is, the relationships are noisy or fuzzy. These fuzzy relationships may be recognizable visually but difficult to define mathematically. Many investors believe that stock prices and stock market indicators exhibit these properties. <P>

A neural net consists of three parts: the inputs, the outputs, and a parallel processing structure that has a number of processors (neurons) with many interconnections. The power of the neural net lies in the tremendous number of interconnections between neurons. <P>

Neural nets are not programmed in the traditional sense; they learn by example. When you build a neural network, you start with a blank sheet of paper. The neural network trains itself on the data that you provide, making literally millions of calculations. It creates the model by finding the statistical relationship between the input (independent) variables that you have defined and the output (dependent) variable or variables. The model is then tested against additional data to confirm that it has produced a generalized relationship and has not just fitted a curve to the training data. When a model has been developed that performs well on the testing data, that model can be used to predict future outcomes using live data. A word of caution: Don't think that you can throw a lot of random data at a neural net and expect to get usable results. The job of the neural network is to find the pattern or model that exists in the data. If no pattern exists, none will be found. The model produced can only be as good as the data. The model formulation should be just as carefully composed with neural nets as with any other analysis tool. <P>

@BRAIN is by far the quickest and easiest to use of the three neural network products I have investigated, the other two being Brainmaker and Neuralyst for Excel. Talon Development has made it relatively easy to implement  neural network models. First, they have incorporated the most widely used spreadsheet, Lotus 1-2-3, as a platform, making it possible to carry out all the steps involved in building the model and analyzing the results directly in Lotus 1-2-3. Second, they have incorporated several advanced features into @BRAIN, such as testing while training, having multiple networks in a single Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet, and accessing trained networks that were created in a different worksheet. To highlight the significance of these features, we will look at the process that is used to develop a neural network model using @BRAIN by constructing a simple model to forecast the S&P 500. <P>

The first step in modeling any relationship is selecting the input and output variables. I've chosen to predict the weekly change in the S&P 500 as our output variable. To keep things simple, our input variables are the weekly changes in the S&P 500 for each of the previous 13 weeks. I start by creating a worksheet containing a column of the weekly closing values for the S&P 500 for the period January 3, 1986, through March 5, 1993. <P>

Statistical data, such as that we're using to forecast the S&P 500, usually has to be modified or preprocessed. Neural networks, when forecasting time series of data such as the S&P 500, prefer data expressed in differences or percents of change, rather than actual values. Some investors incorporate moving averages and other technical indicators as part of the input data set. I have chosen to express our data as weekly percent change. Our independent variables are the weekly percent change for each of the previous 13 weeks. @BRAIN is going to forecast the following week's percent change. Our database thus consists of 375 data points (rows) for the weeks ending January 3, 1986 through March 5, 1993. Each row contains 15 columns: the 13 percent changes representing the input variables, the latest percent change, which represents the output variable, and a blank column for @BRAIN's forecast. Spreadsheets are ideal for preprocessing data and are frequently employed by users of stand-alone neural network products to preprocess data. Since we are working within Lotus 1-2-3, we don't have to transfer the preprocessed data to another program and can, if we like, easily experiment with different methods of preprocessing to find the one that best fits our needs. <P>

A simple diagram of our neural network model is shown in Figure 1. <P>

Figure 1<BR>
Simplified Diagram<BR>
of S&P 500 Forecasting Model<P>

Inputs -<BR>
Thirteen consecutive weekly percent changes in the S&P 500<P>

Solution  Model -<BR>
One or more layers of interconnected processing nodes (neurons) <P>

Output -<BR>
Next week's percent change in the S&P 500<P>


The next step is to define our training, testing, and model evaluation databases. The accepted procedure is to withhold the most recent data points for evaluating the forecasting capabilities of our model and use a 10% to 20% random sample of the remaining data for testing. With @BRAIN, we are able to have just one database for all of our data. We will reserve the last 25 weeks (September 18, 1992, to March 5, 1993) for evaluating our model this is the live data we will use to determine how well it forecasts the weekly change in the S&P 500. Each column of our database represents a variable and has a variable name at the top of the column. Each row represents a single data point, containing one set of input data and the output data point or points that our network will be trained to predict. We will use Lotus 1-2-3's random number function to help us select which rows of data will be used for training and which will be used for testing. An additional column is created in our database and filled with random numbers between 0 and 1. Thus, each data point (spreadsheet row) now contains a random number generated by Lotus 1-2-3. I withhold 10% of our data for testing and use Lotus 1-2-3 commands to tell @BRAIN to use those data points that contain a random number less than or equal to 0.10 for testing; the remaining 90% of the data points will be used for training. I also create a definition range that tells @BRAIN which variables (columns) are input variables and which are output variables. <P>

The next step is to structure the neural network, which means giving our neurons the parameters that are needed for them to function. For most neural network products there are four such parameters, two network configuration parameters and two parameters used to tune the network during training. These parameters function just like additional input variables in that their values affect how well the network performs. @BRAIN has simplified two of these and eliminated the other two. The two network configuration parameters specify the number of layers of processors used to construct the solution model and the number of processors (neurons) in each layer. The minimum configuration is one layer and one processor in that layer. The appropriate number of layers seems to be a function of both the problem being solved and the particular neural net software being used. However, it is seldom necessary to use more than two layers. There seems to be more variation in selecting the number of processors in each layer. Neural net practitioners have developed various rules of thumb for arriving at a good set of network configuration parameters, which is simplified by @BRAIN. @BRAIN will analyze your data and recommend what it judges to be an appropriate network configuration. You can, if you prefer, override this suggested configuration and select one yourself. Most neural network products require that the user specify the learning rate and the momentum. These two tuning parameters regulate the flow of information through the layers of the network. While rules of thumb have been developed for these also, arriving at an optimal solution usually requires tinkering with one or both of them. However, @BRAIN has no network tuning parameters; it tunes the network automatically. <P>

The bane of most neural network developers is an overtrained network. An overtrained network is one that gives excellent results on the training data, but which does not perform well on the test data. The model developed doesn't have the capability to generalize or forecast and is thus worthless. This frequently happens when the stop-training error tolerance is set too tight and when the data set contains noisy or fuzzy data such as stock prices and market indexes. @BRAIN has a built-in safeguard called best-test to prevent this potentially disastrous result. The best-test criteria will stop training when the test data has minimum error. This effectively eliminates overtraining. Therefore, I specify the use of best-test in our model. <P>

Now that we have a trained network what do we do with it? If we were using a stand-alone product, we would probably import our results into a spreadsheet, convert our forecast of percent differences back into S&P 500 values, calculate some statistics, and graph the results. Since we're already in Lotus 1-2-3, we can eliminate step one and proceed with the post-processing and analysis of our results. <P>

How good was our simple model? Let's look at some results. I made several runs, varying the random number pattern each time to see which set of training/testing inputs would produce the model with the best forecast accuracy. Our final model correctly predicted the direction of the next week's change in the S&P 500 18 times for the 25 weeks of evaluation data. Considering the simplicity of the model, these are good results. I've included a graph comparing predicted results with actual results for the evaluation period (see Figure 3). <P>

@BRAIN has filtered out the noise in the input data and identified the underlying pattern inherent in the data. This is graphically illustrated by the frequency distribution of the actual and @BRAIN forecasted weekly percent differences (see figure 2). Notice the tighter distribution of forecasted values. The average actual weekly percent difference is 0.23%; the forecast is 0.21%, close to the actual. However, let's look at the standard deviations of the actual and @BRAIN forecast. Standard deviation measures the amount of the dispersion of a data set around its average value. The standard deviation of the actual is 2.16%, but the standard deviation of the forecast is only 0.51%.<P>

By now you may have guessed that I like this product. Product support is strong; the individual who developed the product is among those available for consultation. I did my evaluation using version 2.4 of Lotus 1-2-3. A Microsoft Excel version is in the works. <P>

@BRAIN is used in a number of areas, including manufacturing, medical research, scientific analysis, academic research and investing. Customers include companies, traders, professional investors, money managers, universities, and individuals. <P>

If you are interested in using neural nets, are a current user who is not totally satisfied with your current product, or are interested in getting more speed, ease of use, and advanced features, you should consider @BRAIN. The product has a 30-day money back guarantee. <P>

<H2 ALIGN="center"> Review of TechniFilter Plus<BR>
by RTR Software, Inc.</H2>
<hr>

<STRONG>Reviewed by Henry Dunlap</STRONG><P>

TechniFilter Plus supplements several technical analysis applications by performing charting of stocks and technical indicators and providing buy and sell signals based on formulas selected by the user. It provides features that most technical analysis programs lack, including the ability to filter and backtest trading strategies. TechniFilter Plus uses data created by outside technical analysis programs. It works with ASCII, MetaStock, Compu Trac, Savant, Dow Jones Market Analyzer, and TeleChart 2000 file formats. However, you must specify which format you plan to use when ordering the program. <P>


<STRONG>System Requirements</STRONG><P>

TechniFilter Plus requires the minimum of an IBM AT, a PS/2, or a 100% compatible computer running on DOS 3.1 or higher. A 386 computer or better with 1 MB of EMS is recommended, and 2 MB of hard-drive space is required for the program. Since the program uses data produced by other programs, there must be additional hard-disk capacity for those data files. <P>

<STRONG>
Tutorial</STRONG><P>

Nine sample sessions are provided in the documentation to demonstrate TechniFilter Plus's main features and to acquaint the new user with the program. The sessions cover some of the program's 185 formulas, 20 strategies, and 35 prepared reports. A sample directory of data files is provided for use with the tutorial. <P>


<STRONG>Backtesting and Optimization</STRONG><P>

TechniFilter Plus provides you with the ability to test and optimize strategies using historical data. It provides 20 predefined strategies for you to use. You can also modify these strategies, or create your own. A strategy consists of formulas, signals, and rules. <P>

A rule depends on one or more signals and can belong to any of nine categories: buy long, sell long, stop long, open short, cover short, stop short, reverse long-to-short, reverse short-to-long, and stop and reverse. A minimum of two rules are necessary in a strategy: one buy rule and one sell rule. <P>

Signals define a relationship among the formulas (comments are permitted in defining signals and are separated by a semicolon). Examples of signals are as follows: <P>

<PRE>    Buy Alert:    F1 &gt; F5 AND F2 &lt; F6
    Buy Signal:   F3 &gt; F5
    Sell Signal:  F8 &lt; 80 and F9 &gt; 80<P></PRE>

Formulas then become the basic building blocks and can be simple data such as high, low, or closing prices for the day; the maximum price or average over a period; a technical indicator like stochastics or relative strength index (RSI); or the slope of a line defined by two points or by a least square fit of the data. The program supplies a formula library of 185 popular formulas including pattern recognition of point and figure charts or candlestick charts. <P>

Once you have created a strategy, TechniFilter Plus allows you to test it against a security or a list of securities over a specified time period. After completion of the test, you can generate several types of reports that provide summary data. These reports include such figures as total profit, capital required, maximum drawdown, risk/reward ratio, percentage return, best/worst trade, longest winning/losing run, and annualized return. Information is available on both open and closed trades, and for long and short trades. <P>

The optimization portion of TechniFilter Plus allows you to take a strategy and modify one or more parameters over a specified range. In this way, you can see how tweaking the parameters can affect the outcome of the strategy. You can also produce charts for this feature to get a graphical feel for the effects of making small changes in a strategy. <P>

Since TechniFilter Plus comes with a number of predefined strategies for backtesting and optimization, I used them with a data set of 19 stocks for which I had daily data for eight years (1986 through 1993). Of these stocks, three had a net price decline during the period - IBM, Digital Equipment and Commonwealth Edison. It was my intent to determine which parameters performed the best with the prepared technical strategies over my group of diverse stocks. The results were unexpected in several ways. First, no strategy beat a buy and hold strategy for more than 85% of the stocks. Second, the optimal parameters varied considerably from stock to stock. And third, most of the commonly used parameters were not valid in the commonly used default terms but required longer terms for profitable trading. On the other hand, many strategies reduced risk by reducing the holdings through bear markets. The chief drawback to many strategies was the number of trades called for and the 1% commission the program assessed for each trade. (The program allows you to set entry and exit fees as either a fixed dollar amount or as a percentage.) <P>

Wilder's relative strength index (RSI) strategy was the best of the prepared strategies tested. The conventional default values are 14 days with a buy when the RSI value passes from below 30 to above 30, and a sell after the RSI has reached higher than 70 and falls below 70. (Stated in simpler terms, Wilder's RSI is a ratio of advances to declines in the time period adjusted to give values from 0 to 100.) The best time period was 21 days with the upper limit set at 75. Some stocks gave the best results with a lower limit less than 30, some at 30, and some with the lower limit greater than 30. The amount of time the stocks were held during the eight years was from 50% to 90% of the period and the risk (as measured by the drawdown divided by the total profit) was substantially reduced using the best RSI set compared with buy and hold. Some stocks had from two to six winning trades versus zero losing trades over the eight-year period. One had 17 winning trades to six losing trades and came through the eight years with an annualized profit of 8.3%, compared to only a 1.6% return from buy and hold with the position being held only 51% of the eight-year period. The hope in using programs such as this is that the past relationship will continue to hold true in the future. <P>


<STRONG>Screening</STRONG><P>

The program supplies 33 predefined reports, and I ran each of them on a directory of 150 stocks. Computing time on a 486DX compatible computer lasted about an hour for all but one of the reports. The beta report alone took a half hour to compute because of the complexities of the calculations and the need for the program to compare data from two separate files, the stock and the S&P 500. <P>

Viewing a report gives the user a series of options with special emphasis on sorting a column in descending order and highlighting that column. You can score any or all of the columns and then sort the report based on the score. You can print a report to the printer or to a file. You can also bring up a chart. Although the charting menu worked well when called from the main menu, I was bounced back to DOS when starting the chart from report mode. <P>

You can automate the process of running a report by creating a batch file. TechniFilter Plus has the capability of complete and automatic filtering and reporting, which can be started from DOS and returns to DOS when finished. A text log is created during the automatic run and can be reviewed later if necessary. <P>


<STRONG>Charting</STRONG><P>

The charts produced by TechniFilter Plus include bar, line, point and figure, and candlestick format. More importantly, TechniFilter Plus can read patterns in all of those formats without having to call up the charts on your screen and in effect search all of your charts for patterns of your choice. <P>

The graphical display allows for splitting the screen and displaying any indicator in either the top or the bottom split, except for point and figure charts (see Figure 2). The date span is controllable by setting the number of days or elements and the start and end dates. For candlestick charts on a VGA monitor, 150 days is a reasonable maximum for clarity. For point and figure charts, the number of periods depend on the activity of the security, the box size, and the number of periods required for a reversal. Using the default for chart craft box size and the default of three days reversal, a point and figure 2,000 day chart showed only dots, not boxes and X's; 1,000 days showed the boxes and X's but no months (see Figure 3); and 900 days showed the numbers for the start of the months. Text can be written on a graph, but text and lines are not saved with the graph as in MetaStock. <P>


<STRONG>Documentation</STRONG><P>

TechniFilter Plus provides documentation in a three-ring binder. It has a table of contents and an index to help locate specific topics. A program guide covers aspects about the normal usage of the program with a reference section covering construction of technical indicators. A chapter listing suggested readings is also included. <P>

A second booklet covers the prepared formulas, reports, and strategies with illustrations and explanations and serves as an introduction to the program along with the sample sessions. Many users of the program will find that this booklet is sufficient to meet most of their needs. <P>


<STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG><P>

In contrast to black box investment software where the user has little knowledge and control over the algorithms used in making buy and sell decisions, TechniFilter Plus is an open tool box that invites you to construct your own indicators from your own ideas, test them over time, and apply them in an efficient manner to your own files. <P>

This may not appeal to a busy investor who wants the computer to think for him. But, as a retired engineer with a yen for tinkering and a strong desire for control over the investment process, I find TechniFilter Plus a powerful tool for searching by files and pointing to stocks worthy of further investigation. <P>

A word of caution is in order: TechniFilter Plus is a sophisticated program that operates at a higher level than charting programs. It is not for the novice investor, but for those who have an understanding of technical analysis and who want to utilize their computer to its full potential. <P>

<H2 ALIGN="center"> Review of Super Charts 1.0<BR>
Omega Research, Inc.</H2>
<hr>
<STRONG>Reviewed by Howard Bandy</STRONG><P>

SuperCharts is a Windows-based charting and technical analysis program that plots data for stocks, bonds, futures, options, and mutual funds. The software includes many technical indicators and supports the creation of new ones. Trading systems can be created and tested on historical data. <P>

<STRONG> -System Requirements-</STRONG> <P>

SuperCharts requires a 286, 386 or 486 processor with 2 megabytes of memory, although 4 megabytes are recommended. Windows version 3.0 or higher is needed with about 5 megabytes of hard disk space. A math co-processor is fully supported, but not essential. A color graphics monitor is required, preferably with high resolution. A high density floppy drive is required to load the program. <P>

The separate, self-contained SuperCharts demonstration program requires about 2.5 megabytes, and will run from DOS. <P>

<STRONG> -Data Requirements-</STRONG> <P>

SuperCharts will accept data directly in formats supported by major data services and other technical analysis programs including: TeleChart 2000, MetaStock, AIQ, CSI, ASCII, Tick Data Inc., Knight Ridder, and CompuTrac.  Data frequency can be tick-by-tick, daily, weekly, or monthly. Data compression, if desired, is handled on-the-fly as data files are read. The data you have already collected can probably be used without modification. SuperCharts does offer direct downloading of security data from on-line vendors. <P>

Storing price and volume data will require about 10 kilobytes per stock per year of daily data. <P>

SuperCharts provides tools to maintain the database. Securities can be added, deleted, or renamed. Data can be added, inserted, deleted, edited, or adjusted for splits. <P>

<STRONG> -Installation-</STRONG> <P>

It is a good idea to install and run the demo first. Windows must be installed prior to installation of SuperCharts. The only difficulty I experienced was a conflict between the DOS 6.0 anti-virus TSR routine and the SuperCharts installation routine. A call to Omega Research technical support quickly identified the problem, the TSR was temporarily removed, and the remainder of the installation went smoothly. <P>

As one step of installation, Super-Charts scans all hard drives installed, identifies data it is able to process, and places the drive and directory paths in one of its pull-down menus for later access. As another step, it verifies the correct operation of all studies, systems, and functions on your computer. Finally, it creates a Program Manager Group containing the SuperCharts icons. <P>

<STRONG> -Tutorial-</STRONG> <P>

For first-time Windows users, Super-Charts includes a tutorial that begins with an introduction to the use of a mouse, the elementary operation of Windows programs, and the manipulation of files. Experienced users can skip this part. <P>

The tutorial then goes through six lessons that include:
<UL><LI> Manipulating pages (screen layouts)
<LI>  Creating new pages and charts
<LI>  Applying graphical tools such as trend lines
<LI>  Applying analytical and indicator tools such as moving averages
<LI>  Creating custom indicators
<LI>  Creating and testing a custom trading system</UL>

<STRONG> -Overview-</STRONG> <P>

The primary unit of SuperCharts data is the page. Pages are saved to and retrieved from the hard disk. Each page can contain from one to 20 chart windows. Each chart window contains the historical price data of a stock (or commodity, index, etc.) Optionally displayed with the first price data series (the one that is being analyzed) are price data series from additional stocks or indexes, and technical indicators and studies. <P>

A typical page could contain one stock and several indicators and studies; or it could contain a set of related stocks and indexes along with some technical indicators and studies. Figure 4 illustrates a page displaying three automotive stocks and the S&P 500. <P>

The individual chart windows can be arranged, moved, and resized as desired. Upon retrieval, the page is restored to the configuration it had when stored. A typical page takes 2,000 to 10,000 bytes of hard disk space in addition to the data files. <P>

In order to set up a chart, a new window is opened and the data is loaded into that window. When loading, tick data can be compressed into intra-day bars of any number of ticks or minutes. Daily data can be loaded as daily or compressed into weekly or monthly data. You can load either the entire data series or a portion of it. Over 50 years of daily data (or about 16,000 ticks) can be accommodated. <P>

Once a page is defined and saved, changes and additions to the data file will be displayed automatically when the page is re-opened. <P>

After setting up one page with price, volume, and several indicators, it is an easy procedure to create copies of that page that are alike in every respect except the data file. Up to 1,000 pages can be saved. My memory of which securities and indicators were on a given page began to fail, so I took advantage of the find command to locate particular pages. <P>

<STRONG> -Tools-</STRONG> <P>

Toolbars along the edges of the screen contain icons for the most common tools or operations. Each tool is also accessible through keyboard strokes. A macro facility is available to record and playback keyboard operations. <P>

Tools include those that create and modify chart items such as trend lines, equally spaced cycle lines, Fibonacci cycle lines, rectangles, ellipses, Gann fan lines, arrows, and text. Complete control over the configuration of each tool is provided. Line type (solid, dashed, dotted), line color, and line width can all be set as the user desires. <P>

It is easy to place a tool on a chart. And it is easy to modify, move, or erase it. Tools will remain in the same position relative to the data when the page is next opened. Those tools that extend past the right margin, such as trendlines, will be automatically extended as additional data is added to the file. <P>

There are four ways to control the amount of data charted. Bar spacing can be adjusted so bars are close together or apart. Scroll bars can be used to scroll left or right. Users can zoom in on an area of the chart. Data can be compressed, from daily to weekly, for example. If trendlines are in place when data is compressed, they stay in their correct positions. <P>

<STRONG> -Technical Indicators-</STRONG> <P>

A library of over 100 technical indicators is provided Table 2 contains a partial listing. Each has been written using the QuickEditor and EasyLan-guage  and can be used as-is or modified as desired. Most indicators have parameters that can be easily changed without having to re-enter the formula. This allows for a quick change of moving average periods, for example. <P>

Any number of indicators can be displayed along with price or in one of seven optional subgraphs in that same window. All graphs in a window are linked by dates, so scrolling and compression are handled correctly. <P>

Tools, such as trendlines, can be applied to indicators just as they can be applied to prices. <P>

SuperCharts is also compatible with all indicator studies (and trading systems) written using TradeStation and System Writer 3.0, to the extent that SuperCharts will allow those studies to be plotted but not modified. <P>

While simple in concept, QuickEditor seems limiting with its fill-in-the-blank style and single-line limitation. It is sometimes difficult to see or imagine an entire study at one time. <P>

There are a limited number of formulas or equations in an indicator or a system test. If one formula refers to an earlier one, the formula must be re-entered rather than simply referenced. (At least I was unable to link indicators and studies together without retyping the formulas.) <P>

<STRONG> -Features-</STRONG> <P>

The Show Me feature places a colored dot above or below a set of bars that satisfy a set of conditions. Figure 5  shows all occurrences of four successively lower closing prices followed by a higher close. <P>

A small, useful library of Show Me studies is provided. They also act as models for custom studies. <P>

The Paint Bars feature changes the colors of the price bars that satisfy a set of conditions. <P>

Paint Bars and Show Me are excellent tools for locating patterns that precede market action. <P>

<STRONG> -Profitability Testing-</STRONG> <P>

SuperCharts accepts long and short positions, commissions, slippage, and several varieties of stops. It recognizes the relationship between the size of a futures contract, the minimum price movement, and the dollar value of each move. Targets and stops can be set in percentages or in dollar values. <P>

After testing, a graphical display of buy and sell signals is displayed along with the price data. A written or printed trade-by-trade listing and summary is also available. Like trendlines and other studies, when additional data is added to the file, the profitability test will be brought up to date the next time the page is opened, showing clear buy and sell signals. Figure 6 displays the signals from a simple moving average trading system, and Figure 7 shows a portion of the summary report (similar sections detail the long transactions and short transactions). <P>

A small library of classical trading systems is included. The QuickEditor can be used to create others. <P>

SuperCharts is weak in system testing and optimization operations. It is very slow and tedious to change arguments to a system and reapply that system to a single stock. There are no features to apply a trading system to a selection of stocks or apply a selection of systems to a single stock. There are no features to vary an argument through a range and observe the effect on a trading system; however, Omega Research does offer System Writer and TradeStation for that purpose. <P>

<STRONG> -Documentation-</STRONG> <P>

Full help from a drop-down menu is available at all times. The help screens essentially duplicate the reference manual. <P>

Omega Research maintains a bulletin board for registered users of its products. At the time I logged on, the bulletin board contained some updated device drivers. <P>

The manual needs to be expanded with more explanations and examples, particularly in the description of functions. It could also use a better index. <P>

<STRONG> -Customizing SuperCharts-</STRONG> <P>

One of the strengths of SuperCharts is the ease of its customization. Windows can be sized and positioned as desired. Tools can be placed, modified, and moved. Library studies can be modified. Custom indicators and studies can be created. Icons can be assigned to pages, indicators, or studies. Toolbars can be relocated or hidden. <P>

<STRONG> -Conclusion-</STRONG> <P>

SuperCharts is a powerful and flexible graphically oriented technical analysis package that deserves serious consideration by every person looking for his or her first technical analysis program and by most people who already have one. The program's features that preserve and extend tools and studies  as new data is added are particularly helpful. <P>

The Myths of Retirement Planning  </H2><P>
<HR>
Many individuals harbor rosy misconceptions about how much income and/or assets they would need to become financially independent and live a comfortable retirement.<P>


Today, pension and Social Security benefits are not what they once were, financial institutions and insurance companies have become a concern and require close scrutiny, and health care costs seem to be rising out of control. With all of these scenarios continuing to be played out, wise planning is essential.<P>


It is important that you do not get caught up in myths about achieving financial freedom and instead base your own retirement and financial independence planning upon solid facts. A look at the popular myths and why they are myths should help keep you on the right track.<P>


<H3>Myth #1: You will not need as much money during retirement as you do now.</H3>


The general rule of thumb says that you will need approximately 70% of your pre-retirement income to maintain a lifestyle similar to your current one. This may be true if you live your current lifestyle.<P>


However, when you retire, you will have more free time for travel, leisure activities, hobbies, and other things you might like to do during your retirement years. All of these may mean an increased expense in these areas. In addition, medical expenses will increase at a faster rate than they likely did during your pre-retirement years. Also, your overall tax rate may not drop very much and you may live longer than you think. Currently, if you are age 65 your life expectancy is approximately 21 years, which is a long time to plan for. Finally, why plan for a meager retirement when you can begin planning well ahead and have the income you need to live the lifestyle you wish during retirement?<P>


<H3>Myth #2: You can afford to start planning for your retirement a few years before your retirement date.</H3>


In fact, it is never too soon to begin planning for your retirement. Time is one of the most powerful tools in the accumulation of wealth. The sooner you start to accumulate assets and plan for your retirement years, the better, and the less you will need to set aside each year in order to achieve the same objective.<P>


In order to achieve your various financial objectives, you need to have an active savings and investment program. This should be geared not only for your retirement years but also for the large obligations you believe will be coming up in the future such as college funding, weddings, etc. Planning for your financial independence will require some thought and soul-searching analysis to determine what is really important to you since, for most of us, this will mean giving up some objectives in order to achieve others.<P>


You should start to discuss and set specific goals for your financial independence at least 25 years ahead of time. You can always adjust each year for your objectives if necessary, but it is better to begin planning early than to wait.<P>


<H3>Myth #3: Social Security will provide enough income for my retirement years.</H3>


The fact is that Social Security accounted for approximately 38% of the average retirees' income in calendar year 1990. This year, the average benefit for all retired persons was approximately $602 per month, even though the maximum monthly benefit was much higher. Although increases in benefits have occurred and may continue to occur, it is likely they may become less generous than they have in the past.<P>


In addition, the current plans are to extend the age that you must reach in order to receive full retirement benefits. Thus, it is becoming ever more important for you to accumulate your own funds in addition to whatever the government programs can provide. Social Security should be considered a supplemental benefit to your retirement financial planning and not the foundation on which it is built.<P>


<H3>Myth #4: I have my pension plan to provide for my retirement income and will not need any additional savings.</H3>


The truth is that without planning well in advance, it will be difficult to tell whether your pension, combined with Social Security, will or will not achieve your financial objectives.<P>


If you are at a company that offers a defined benefit plan, your retirement benefit will be a monthly income stream based on some percentage of your salary during the last few years of your employment at the firm and the number of years you worked there. However, most employees do not stay with one employer for a long period of time, and are unable to accumulate much in earned benefits.<P>


In addition, many employers are replacing defined benefit plans with defined contribution plans and allowing employees more say in the management of these funds. It will be increasingly important for you to make the proper investment decisions if you are to achieve the accumulation level you need in order to live the lifestyle you would like during your retirement years. Thus, you will see fewer employers committing to a monthly income stream for their retirees in the future; instead, you will have employers making plans available and probably contributing a portion of the funds to a retirement account for individuals. However, it will be your job to see that the contributions accumulated are at rates sufficient for you to achieve your financial objectives and if they are not, to create your own supplemental savings plan in order to see that your objectives are achieved.<P>


<H3>Myth #5: Medicare will take care of my health insurance.</H3>


Typically, Medicare pays less than half of a retiree's medical bills, and you usually cannot start collecting this until age 65. In addition, many employers are cutting back on medical coverage for retirees due to the cost. You will need to look at and plan for the costs involved for your health insurance during the retirement years and consider Medicare supplements and possibly long-term care insurance coverage. For many of us, these are costs that we never had, or incurred minimally, during our working years but which will now be a major part of our annual budget.<P>


<H3>Myth #6: All of my assets are in safe vehicles for long-term accumulation and do not need to be watched closely.</H3>


The fact is that all investments need to be watched. With the banking and savings and loan crisis along with the recent concerns over insurance companies, the "old standbys," which were once considered our safe havens, have come into question. In addition, the practice of putting all of our assets into extremely safe vehicles brings to bear an additional risk--that of purchasing power loss.<P>


The loss of purchasing power can be a devastating risk to deal with because it happens gradually over a long period of time, and many times goes unnoticed year to year. The only thing you know is that things seem to get a little bit tighter each year, but you still try to make it. By the time you realize you need to make major adjustments, it is almost too late.<P>


<H3>Myth #7: You can always use the equity in your home to add to your retirement income.</H3>


While it is possible that the above scenario could occur, it is unlikely that this will add much to your retirement income, especially without making you extremely uncomfortable.<P>


Over the last few years, in many areas of the country, home prices have dropped. It is unclear whether home prices will bounce back and increase with inflation, as they did in years past. In addition, other costs to maintain your home such as property taxes, repair costs, etc., will tend to increase.<P>


If you do use your home to supplement your retirement income, remember to take advantage of all the tax breaks available to you, especially when downsizing.<P>


Home equity annuities may become more popular in the future, and it would be worthwhile to become familiar with this option just in case you need it.<P>


<H3>Myth #8: If need be, my family could always help me out.</H3>


The fact is that many of us may use this as an excuse for delaying our retirement planning but, in reality, no one wants to rely on other family members to help them financially fund their retirement years. If anything, these are the years when you want true financial independence and do not want to feel as if you are a burden on your family. This independence becomes more and more important as you reach your retirement years, and anyone using the above statement to rationalize away their need for savings and retirement planning will live to regret it.<P>


<H3>Myth #9: Money is everything when it comes to retirement planning.</H3>


Nothing could be further from the truth! While money is important, it is the lifestyle decisions that are really the most important concerns for your retirement years. Money is important in that it is needed in order to finance the lifestyle decisions you make, and for this reason it is important to plan as early as possible for funding the lifestyle you would like to lead.<P>


Where you live, how and where you will vacation, what you will do with your spare time, and a realization of your participation in other interests all become extremely important issues during your retirement years. You may even decide to start a second business or enter a different career and possibly make one of your hobbies or interests your remaining life's work. The whole point here is that a comfortable and successful retirement is about fulfillment of objectives and not accumulation of money. It is about enjoying your life to the fullest, which is based on your definition of happiness. Money is a tool to help you achieve these ends, but it is not the end itself.<P>


As you think about some of the issues presented here, ask yourself whether or not you are basing your own financial independence upon any of these "myths." If so, it is time to take a serious look at your financial independence planning and get on track so that your retirement years can be lived to their fullest in the manner you wish and not be constrained by the mistakes you made in  previous years.<P>

What Are Your Sources of Retirement Income?  </H2></P>
<HR>
Almost all investors would agree that providing for a comfortable retirement is a paramount financial objective. To plan properly, you need to answer two questions:<P>

<UL>
<LI>How much will be needed for retirement?<P>


<LI>What will be the sources for meeting that need?<P>
</UL>

Estimating your retirement needs, of course, is not an easy task. But equally difficult is the other half of the equation--sorting out where your retirement dollars will originate. For most individuals, there are four basic retirement income sources: Social Security, employer-sponsored defined benefit plans, tax-deferred savings plans such as 401(k)s, and personal savings. How much you are likely to receive from each of these sources will vary greatly with personal circumstances, of course.<P>


What can you expect to receive from Social Security at retirement? Benefits come in the form of monthly payments, based on your final years' salary and number of working years. You can get an estimate of your earned Social Security benefits by sending in Form SSA-7004 "Request for Social Security Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement" to Social Security [call 800/772-1213 to request form]. The statement lists your earnings for each year and provides an estimate of benefits, based on when you plan to retire (you are asked your retirement date when you fill out the request form). To calculate the estimate, Social Security must make a number of assumptions concerning future earnings; thus, the closer you are to retirement, the more realistic the estimate.<P>


For those who have maximum taxable earnings, Social Security is designed to replace roughly 25% of the portion of pay subject to Social Security taxes; individuals who have earnings that are less than the maximum subject to Social Security taxes receive a somewhat higher percentage of their final pay in the form of benefits.<P>


Another potential retirement income source is employer-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans--commonly called "pension" plans.<P>


Benefits received under these plans are in the form of monthly payments, based on the employee's years of service and final years' salary. Monthly retirement benefits from defined benefit plans may be paid either directly by the company, or from annuities purchased by the company.<P>


Employees start accruing benefits (known as "vesting") after a certain number of years with a firm. Benefits under these plans are usually based on your years of service and either your average salary for the last five years or the last full year of employment; most plans then multiply the salary figure and the years of service by a percentage to calculate the actual amount at retirement. Pension plans are designed to replace only a portion of your salary upon retirement.<P>


If your company sponsors a defined benefit plan, you should check the rules regarding when you vest in the plan, the formula used to determine your monthly benefit (especially important for those who expect to retire soon), whether the plan has a cost-of-living adjustment for retirees (a few do), and the portability of your benefits. The latter offers employees considerable flexibility: Some defined benefit plans have been modified recently to allow you to take the present value of some of your accrued benefits with you when you leave the company (a so-called "cash balance" plan). You then have the option of rolling this over into an IRA; if you have enough investment acumen, you may be able to grow these dollars to a higher level than would have accrued under the plan. Make sure you understand the tax rules regarding distributions and rollovers, however.<P>


Some employers will give current employees an annual estimate of what they can expect to receive at retirement. The caveat is that the estimate makes certain assumptions: you will work at the same company until retirement and your salary increases by a certain fixed percentage (often only 3% or 4%).<P>


If you leave a company before retirement and are vested in the firm's defined benefit plan, you should request a calculation of the monthly benefits that could be expected at the normal retirement age.<P>


Many companies are phasing out pension plans in favor of contributory plans, such as 401(k) plans. For that reason, pension plans are likely to be a larger source of retirement income to today's older workers, while contributory plans are most likely to play a large role in younger workers' retirement plans.<P>


Contributory plans allow employees to invest pretax money (up to set limits) in various investment alternatives chosen by the employer. Employers do not have to match an employee's contribution, although many do match part or all of what an employee puts into the plan.<P>


Retirement benefits from a contributory plan come in the form of a lump-sum dollar amount upon retirement. The size of this amount will depend on the investment choices you make over the years, the amount contributed each year, and the number of years you participate. You can make a very rough calculation of your final amount by making an estimate of your annual contributions, the number of years to retirement and the approximate return you expect on your investments (based on your investment mix), and using an annuity table (the future value of a periodic investment).<P>


Clearly, the size of your benefits depends on decisions you make within the limits of the choices offered. If you are a participant in a 401(k)-type plan, you should make sure you understand the investment choices available, and you should carefully plan an investment strategy making best use of the options.<P>


You should also become familiar with the administrative rules governing the plan. While an employee has a vested right to the current value of the money he contributed, he may not have an immediate right to any contribution made by the employer. Often a plan states that the employer's contribution vests to the employee after a period of time --say, one year. Employees leaving one company for another should know exactly what they are entitled to from their former plan. In addition, they should be aware of the tax rules regarding distributions and rollovers.<P>


The last source for potential retirement income is personal savings. For the most part, your personal savings will consist of a lump-sum amount that you will have saved by retirement, based on how much you have saved and where you have invested it. If you have purchased annuities, however, you will receive a monthly fixed payment.<P>


One way of analyzing your retirement sources is by dividing them into sources of periodic income and sources of lump-sum assets upon retirement. The latter would supplement the former to the extent that further retirement income is needed. Table 1 lists possible sources of periodic income and sources of lump-sum assets at retirement, as well as their tax characteristics at retirement.<P>


What steps should you take to beef up your sources?<P>


For older workers (for instance, those in the 55 to 60 age group):<P>

<UL>
<LI>You cannot do very much about your Social Security or defined benefit sources.<P>


<LI>If you expect to work for several more years, maximize your use of a 401(k) and choose investment options that offer some growth of capital with moderate risk. The current level of interest rates means that GICs might provide a return around 6.0%; a balanced fund option might give you higher returns with more risk. An aggressive stock fund should be avoided because of the high volatility associated with that investment and the limited time available to recover from a market decline.<P>


<LI>Personal savings should be maximized, but a caveat is required regarding tax-free securities: If you plan to hold them while you are collecting Social Security, you must include all of your tax-free income when calculating the possible tax on Social Security benefits.<P>
</UL>

For younger workers: <P>

<UL>
<LI>Realize that you must place a far lower reliance on defined benefit dollars for retirement, and possibly even Social Security.<P>


<LI>The significance of 401(k) plans means that you must make the most of these plans, contributing the maximum amount that you can and investing for the long term. This means equity investment, especially growth stock vehicles if they are available.<P>


<LI>Personal savings must be maximized to make up for the diminished dollars from Social Security.<P>

 How Much of Your Salary Do You Need to Save for Retirement?  </H2><P>
<HR>
Two elements are essential to any savings plan: You must know how much you need, and you must know when you will need it.<P>


For retirement planning, those elements aren't at all easy to figure out, causing many people to throw up their hands and ignore the question entirely.<P>


However, the accompanying worksheet provides a simplified approach that can be used to come up with a reasonable retirement savings plan. There are limitations to the approach, and it is important that you understand those limitations and the assumptions used. The approach is designed to help you determine what percentage of your salary you need to set aside each year so that by retirement, you have accumulated enough savings to generate a desired real (inflation-adjusted) level of income throughout your retirement years.<P>


There are two important concepts you must understand when dealing with time and money. The first is the power of compounding. When money is invested, it produces earnings that can then be reinvested, so that you receive earnings on your earnings in addition to the earnings on your original investment. This added boost is the power of compounding, and the longer the money is invested, the more powerful are its effects. Over long periods of time--20, 30, or 40 years--the effects of compounding at different rates can be substantial. For instance, if you invested $10,000 today you would have $100,626 at the end of 30 years if it earned 8% annually; if it earned 9% you would have $132,676.<P>


You can see the advantages of earning higher returns over long time periods. But you must be very careful when making retirement plans that involve extremely long time periods--small differences in return assumptions can turn into large differences in accumulation. Be conservative in your estimates.<P>


The second important concept concerns the value of a dollar today versus tomorrow. Over time, inflation erodes the worth of money, so that a given amount buys less in the future than it can today. When you are planning for the future, you are examining dollars over numerous time periods. To compare them, you need to put them on an equal purchasing-power footing, so they are all in equivalent dollar terms. In the approach used here, the equal footing will be the purchasing power of today's dollars--that is, dollar amounts will always be stated in terms of today's dollar equivalent.<P>


The worksheet will take you through each step in the retirement savings calculation. The tables at the end of the worksheet provide factors that are used in the worksheet to translate your retirement annuity, your savings growth rate, and your needed annual payment into today's dollars.<P>


Variables you will need to determine to fill out the worksheet are:<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>The number of years you will spend in retirement:</STRONG> The approach here assumes you will use up all of your savings in retirement, so the question boils down to how long you will live after you retire. If you plan to retire at age 65, assume a retirement period of at least a minimum of 20 years, or longer to be more conservative.<P>


<LI><STRONG>The number of years until you retire:</STRONG> The age at which you want to retire minus your current age.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Your total current savings:</STRONG> Savings you have accumulated up until now either in taxable accounts or tax-deferred accounts such as individual retirement accounts or 401(k) plans.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Your desired annual income in retirement:</STRONG> Use your current gross, pretax salary as a guide. Many retirement professionals assume that retirees need about 80% of their pre-retirement salary for retirement income; 100% of your current gross salary is a more conservative estimate. You do not need to adjust your desired income level for inflation; the tables will adjust it for you.<P>


<LI><STRONG>The investment returns you expect on your savings:</STRONG> Your return will be a function of the mix of investments in your savings portfolio. Table 1 presents conservative estimates of returns for several major investment categories, based on historical returns over the past 50 years. If savings are roughly divided evenly between stocks and bonds, your return would be 50% of the return from stocks plus 50% of the return from bonds.<P>
</UL>

Some questions you may have as you go through the worksheet:<P>

<UL>
<LI>How should you treat outside sources of retirement income in your desired annual income figure? You may want to subtract out outside sources of retirement income such as Social Security and any pension benefits from defined benefit plans (contributory plans, such as 401(k)s, should be considered savings); use the annual benefit stated in today's dollars. Estimates on your earned Social Security benefits can be obtained by filling out the Request for Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (to get a copy, call the Social Security Administration at 800/772-1213 and ask for the form). If you have any pension benefits, your employer's benefits department should provide you with an estimate. Be wary, however, of the Social Security situation, particularly if you will not be receiving benefits for many years. You may want to leave it out.<P>


<LI>How do taxes affect your expected return on savings? If most of your savings are in tax-deferred accounts, such as an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan, your return will be unaffected by taxes. However, if your savings are in taxable accounts, reduce your expected return to account for taxes. Taxes will have less of an impact on certain investments, such as stocks and low turnover stock mutual funds, since most of their return is due to long-term capital gains. The table of return estimates provides rough guidelines for after-tax rates of return for individuals in the 15% and 28% tax brackets, assuming all returns for all categories are taxed annually.<P>


<LI>What if your savings are in both tax-deferred and taxable accounts? Do separate calculations for your taxable and tax-deferred savings, multiplying them by different savings growth factors based on the different return assumptions. Then add them together.<P>


<LI>Will your returns be similar before and after retirement? Some individuals become more conservative after retirement, particularly as assets are drawn down and income and liquidity become more of a concern. On the other hand, it is important to keep some exposure to higher-return equities. You will have to decide what mix of investments you can live with at that stage.<P>


<LI>Should you reduce your return expectations to account for inflation? No. The tables already take inflation into account.
</UL>

The approach used in the worksheet is fairly straightforward, but it makes several assumptions. First, it assumes a 4% rate of inflation. It also assumes that all of your savings will be used up by the end of your retirement period. In the last step, it assumes that your annual salary will grow at the rate of inflation.<P>


You may want to go through the worksheet several times using different variables--for instance, assuming different rates of return in your projections. This will illustrate the impact of these variables on your plans, and may prompt you to rethink some of your assumptions and perhaps even your plans. For instance, it will become clear that the earlier you start saving, the less you need to put aside each year; similarly, the more aggressively you invest (within reason), the less you need to put aside annually.<P>


The approach in the worksheet provides you with an indication of the percentage of your salary that you need to save each year, the most commonly recommended way to save and the method used by many retirement plans, which are usually based on a percentage of one's salary.<P>


However, some individuals may prefer to invest a fixed dollar amount each year, an amount that remains constant--for instance $5,000 each year, unadjusted for inflation. While the worksheet produces an annual savings amount, this is in today's dollars--an inflation-adjusted amount that maintains today's purchasing power; however, in future dollar terms, it increases each year by the inflation rate. If you want to save a fixed dollar amount and still meet your stated retirement goal, the Fixed Annual Savings approach at the very bottom of the worksheet shows you how to do this.<P>


Time plays a major factor in retirement estimates. The effects of compounding over a very long time period can mean big swings in results with only a small difference in assumptions. Use conservative assumptions, but also understand that this planning device only provides a rough guide. Aim for a general savings target, and every few years review your assumptions and try to bring it into better focus.<P>


When you retire, you will have to adjust your lifestyle to your savings, rather than the other way around.<P>

Mutual Funds: To Sell, or Not to Sell?</H2><P>
<HR>

The need to ultimately sell a mutual fund should be kept in mind whenever you're selecting a new fund. It's good to at least have a general idea of how long you'll want to remain invested.<p>


But broadly speaking, aside from adjustments dictated by a market timing or asset allocation strategy, or changes in personal circumstances, the main reason for contemplating a sale is that a fund is not living up to your expectations. <p>


Everyone should be prepared to jettison investments that aren't living up to expectations. When making this decision, you re-evaluate the same factors you considered when buying. Fund prospectuses and profiles in mutual fund guidebooks should be studied at least once a year to keep abreast of changing fundamentals.<p>


The reasons for becoming dissatisfied fall into several categories.<p>

<blockquote><strong>Performance: </strong>For most people this should be the single most important consideration. If a value-oriented, large-cap stock fund has lagged its peers for perhaps two years, it might be time to switch. You should also check to see how the portfolio has fared relative to an appropriate index. You can, for example, compare a growth and income fund against the S&P 500, a small stock portfolio with the Russell 2000, an international fund with the Europe, Australia, Far East (EAFE) index, and a junk bond fund with the Salomon high-yield corporate bond index.<p>


<strong>Expenses, portfolio turnover and size: </strong>These are not primary considerations, but you should monitor them in your funds. An expense ratio that is climbing noticeably should be a cause for concern, since expenses drag down performance. A change in the portfolio turnover rate could reflect a change in management style. And size can be important if it could hurt performance--for instance, a small company growth fund that has become so big that its character has changed might be a candidate for selling.<p>


<strong>Services: </strong>This is typically not a critical factor, since most fund complexes try hard to deliver good service. But if your company's services aren't what you want them to be you should look elsewhere.<p>


<strong>Management:</strong> A change in management may or may not be a concern. You need to find out the explanation for the move and the background and qualifications of the person taking the helm.<p>


<strong>Mergers:</strong> A typical merger involves a small, poor-performing fund that is absorbed by a larger, better-performing fund within the same family--fund companies like to take the opportunity to erase the bad records of their losers. If you're a shareholder of the fund to be merged and you elect to stay, you would generally receive shares of the acquiring fund in what is normally a tax-free exchange. The objectives and track record of the acquiring fund are major considerations in the decision whether or not to sell.<p>
</blockquote>

You may be better off not selling in many situations. Here are some "don'ts" to consider.<p>

<ul>
<li>Don't sell too soon. The fact that a fund has performed so well for so long does not mean that it's going to have to do poorly in the future. There will always be a select group of funds, such as those on Forbes honor roll, that outperform the market for remarkably long spans.<p>


<li>Don't sell just after a big plunge, as on October 19, 1987. This is panic-selling, and many who sold at that time undoubtedly regretted it after they witnessed the subsequent, relatively speedy recovery. You never know exactly when the market and your fund might rebound. <p>


<li>Don't set mental "stop-loss" sell prices. Some people might want to bail out if their fund falls below, say, 5% or 10% of the present price, or what they paid for most of their shares. But, unlike some stocks, funds should not be sold just because their prices are declining. However, volatile sector and single-country funds, which often act like stocks, should be treated differently.<p>


<li>Think twice about selling a fund on which you have a large unrealized gain. Selling can give rise to an unnecessary tax liability if your fund is in a taxable account. Your pretax return is reduced by the amount of any taxes paid on realized gains.<p>


<li>Think twice before selling one of your funds to invest in another that was recommended to you. The recommended fund may already have had a good run-up in price. But if you feel the suggestion has merit, do your own investigation before making any moves.<p>
</ul>

The sell decision is often more difficult than the initial decision to buy. That's why you should have a well thought-out investment plan that you follow consistently over the years. By sticking with the plan, you are less likely to be swayed by short-term market developments. However, remember that "forever" is not a meaningful time horizon for any investor.<p>

Growth vs. Value: Does It Pay to Have Style?</H2><P>
<HR>

In the fashion world, those who are style-conscious constantly monitor the pulse of popularity in an effort to determine the trend-setting style for the year.<p>


The investment world has its own haute couture, with certain trendsetting styles that are "in" one year and "out" the next. Among fashion-conscious stock investors, two styles in particular are closely monitored: value investing and growth investing. <p>


Investment fashion watchers generally concur that growth investing has been "in" for several years, but that the fashion tide is now turning. How can they tell? Most of the evidence is observational. For instance, growth-oriented stocks appear to have been the herd leaders of the bull market over the past several years, while more recent winners have been value-oriented stocks. Another indicator is the varied performance experiences of mutual funds using the two different approaches. Several well-known and highly regarded value-oriented funds slipped in years past, but have more recently recovered--both movements that have been attributed in part to their investment style.<p>


Although these observations are not backed up by research, it is not illogical to assume that each style would do better during different parts of the market cycle. That's because the two approaches will tend to produce portfolios that focus on different segments of the market, and different market segments do better at various times within a market cycle.<p>


Recent articles in the popular financial press have promoted the "new" idea that investment success can be achieved by being fashion-conscious and riding the current trends. All you have to do, for instance, is invest in a mutual fund that's using the investment style--either growth or value--that is currently doing well, and when that style runs out of favor, move to the other style.


Is this really a new and useful idea? It is certainly not new; it is more of a repackaged idea not much different from market sector rotation--putting money into the various parts of the market at different stages of the economic cycle in an attempt to hit a segment as it peaks. It is also a form of market timing, and the problem is that if you are wrong, you risk considerable losses from the area you have chosen, and you risk missing out on the segment that actually is doing well.<p>


Concentrating on one approach exclusively violates two important investing concepts:<p>

<ul>
<li> Individuals should be diversified in terms of the kinds of stocks they are invested in, and<p>


<li>Individuals should be diversified across various time periods, with a long-term (over five years) investment horizon.<p>
</ul>

That doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile knowing the differences in the two styles, since it may help you avoid being unknowingly concentrated in one area.<p>


Growth investing consists of looking at companies that are showing above-average increases in earnings or sales, or those that operate in industries or sectors of the market that have exceptional growth potential.<p>


One good example is the CGM Capital Development Fund (formerly Loomis-Sayles Capital Development). The fund's prospectus states: <p>


"The fund may invest in many types of companies. These companies include: well-established companies with records of above-average growth and with promise of maintaining their leadership positions in their industries; companies likely to benefit from internal revitalization or innovations, changes in consumer demand or basic economic forces; and smaller companies with good management and attractive prospects ...."<p>


This focus is reflected in the fund's holdings. The fund's annual report, dated December 31, 1990, notes that the fund's largest industry positions are drugs and hospital supplies, which alone accounted for 42% of its holdings. The fund also has holdings in health care services, which account for about 8% of the portfolio.<p>


Twentieth Century's Growth Investors fund uses a similar approach, choosing stocks "primarily for their growth potential." Its holdings (as of October 31, 1990) included 20% in pharmaceuticals, 16% in computer systems, software and peripherals, and 13% in energy.<p>


Clearly, both funds have their eyes on sectors of the market that are currently viewed as having significant future growth prospects.<p>


Value investing, on the other hand, looks for undervalued situations. These investors seek stocks with low price-earnings ratios, companies selling below book value or with "hidden" assets that are not reflected in the stock's price.<p>


The Vanguard Windsor fund is an excellent example of a value investor. The prospectus states:<p>


"The fund invests primarily in common stocks, which are selected principally on the basis of fundamental investment value. Crucial to the valuation process is the relationship of a company's underlying earning power and dividend payout to the market price of its stock. The fund's holdings usually are characterized by relatively low price-earnings ratios and meaningful income yields. At the time of purchase, many of the fund's securities are considered to be undervalued or overlooked by the market."<p>


The fund's holdings? As of October 31, 1990, among the largest were banks, 14%; automotive, 12%; and airlines, 7%. These are certainly not industries you would currently mention when discussing growth potential.<p>


All three of these funds have had good long-term track records and portfolio managers who are highly regarded. And they have had individual years in which they fell out--most notably 1988 for Twentieth Century Growth and CGM Capital, and 1990 for Windsor.<p>


The lesson is not to avoid styles. If you invest on your own, you have to start somewhere in order to choose a group of stocks. But be aware that relying on one style may result in a concentrated portfolio--one that may not necessarily be focused on a particular firm or industry, but rather on a group of industries that may perform similarly given the same economic conditions.<p>


If you are a mutual fund investor, you should be aware of the portfolio manager's approach. A well-managed mutual fund will have a style that can be clearly understood by reading the prospectus and looking at the fund's reports. Some funds may use a mixture of styles, in which case you may want to check the fund's holdings to see if any one particular style appears to predominate. But if you invest in several stock funds, make sure you are not duplicating one fund's efforts--and the risks--by investing in a similar fund.<p>


In the investment world, you should be aware of style, but it pays to be dressed for any occasion.<p>

What Investors Should Know About Financial Statements </H2><P>
<HR>

"Financial statements are like fine perfume; to be sniffed but not swallowed."--Abraham Brilloff<p>


Most people assume that the production of a financial statement is an exact science and that the numbers are cut-and-dried. This is not true. As surprising as it may seem, the same set of facts about a company's transactions and operations can lead to quite different values for earnings, assets, and liabilities. Writing financial statements involves a variety of assumptions, estimates and choices about how values are reported. Uncritical acceptance of financial statements can end up causing bigger headaches to investors than those produced when they are carefully read.<p>


Understanding financial statements means learning a little of the language in which they are written. That language is accounting, the language of business. Familiar terms have more precise meaning when used in financial statements. For example, common usage associates assets with financial strength. This is not always the case. Some banks and savings and loans that recently trumpeted their massive assets are now in the hands of the regulators because their liabilities were even more massive. Assets, revenues, profits, and cash flows need to be evaluated in relation to other information contained in financial statements.<p>


Three financial statements tell managers, creditors, and investors about the financial health of a business: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. The balance sheet presents the current financial condition of the business. The income statement summarizes profit performance over a specified period. The cash flow statement reports the movement of cash into and out of the company for the year.<p>

<br>
<H3>The Balance Sheet</H3><p>


The balance sheet lists the accounting value of a firm's assets, liabilities, and net worth as of a particular date. It is a snapshot of the firm's financial condition at the close of an accounting period. Although it is sometimes called the Statement of Financial Position or the Statement of Financial Condition, the name Balance Sheet describes an important characteristic: The assets of a firm balance the liabilities and shareholders' equity.<p>


Balance sheets follow a fairly standard format. Various accounts are placed in standard classes and presented in order. The example in Table 1 shows the major asset and liability classes. Though the company in our example has no other assets, the example lists this class for completeness. Other assets can include securities held as long-term investments and intangible assets such as goodwill and patents. Companies that have no other assets usually do not list this class.<p>

<hr>
<br>
The left side of a balance sheet lists assets--the things a firm owns and uses to conduct business. The right side lists the claims against the value of the assets on the left. Accountants and financial executives often use the left side as a synonym for assets and the right side as a synonym for liabilities and shareholders' equity. This can be confusing if, as frequently happens, the balance sheet in question is organized vertically, with assets first, followed by liabilities and shareholders' equity.<p>

<br>
<H3>The Income Statement</H3><p>


If a balance sheet is like a snapshot, an income statement is more like a movie. An income statement shows how resources were used over time to produce a profit or loss. Other names for an income statement are Earnings Statement and Statement of Operations. An income statement expresses the following relationship:<p>


Earnings = sales revenue - cost of goods sold - operating expenses + non-operating income - non-operating expense - taxes<p>


Most income statements will be similar in form and content to the example in Table 2. Information about the sales revenues, expenses, and income is listed first, so that the reader can assess the firm's performance in its major, ongoing activities. Income and expenses from secondary activities are summarized separately as non-operating income (expense) or other income (expense). However, there is no standard rule. Some companies combine all expenses below the gross margin line into a single amount that is subtracted from the gross margin to arrive at earnings.<p>

Terminology can also vary. Sometimes earnings are called profits or income. Sales revenue might be called simply sales or revenues. Any of these terms might be preceded by net without changing their essential meaning.<p>


Most businesses report earnings using the accrual principle of accounting. This means that sales revenues and related expenses are recorded when they are earned and incurred whether or not cash has been received or paid. Accrual basis accounting includes credit sales in the revenue line on the income statement and records them as accounts receivable in the balance sheet. Similarly, both paid and unpaid expenses are recorded as expenses on the income statement. On the balance sheet, unpaid (accrued) expenses are listed under current liabilities. The accrual principle says that sales revenue should be recorded when it is earned and that expenses should be recorded when the goods and services that generate expenses are used. Accrual accounting results in the best measure of a firm's profitability and allows a fair comparison with previous periods.<p>

<br>
<H3>The Cash Flow Statement</H3><p>


Cash inflows and outflows are the heartbeat of a business. The cash flow statement tells how a company spends its money and where that money comes from. The cash flow statement is much like a summary of a firm's checking account. Cash inflows and outflows are put into three classes:<p>

<ul>
<li> Cash flows from operating activities--the cash impact of all profit-making activities.<p>


<li> Cash flows from investing activities--the cash impact of buying or selling long-term assets.<p>


<li> Cash flows from financing activities--the cash impact of transactions with lenders and shareholders.<p>
</ul>

While many income statements segregate operating and non-operating income, the cash flow statement does not recognize this distinction. Cash flows from operating activities include activities such as receiving dividends and interest, as well as paying interest and taxes, even though these activities might be reported in the non-operating income section of the income statement.<p>


There are two acceptable formats for the operating activities section. Both are easy to understand.  The direct method is a simple statement of cash received and disbursed. The indirect method starts with earnings from the income statement and adjusts for non-cash items. The remaining entries in the indirect method are changes between last year's balance sheet and this year's. At the bottom of the cash flow statement, the increase in cash ties last year's cash balance to this year's. I like the indirect method because it links all three financial statements. In the example later in this article, we will examine a cash flow statement done this way.<p>

<br>
<H3>Know What You Are Reading</H3><p>


So much for the descriptions of the basic financial statements. The real questions are: What can you do with the information, and what should you watch out for?<p>


A certified public accountant (CPA) is usually involved somewhere in the production of financial statements. An unwary reader might assume that CPA involvement constitutes a stamp of approval. CPAs can actually perform three different procedures related to financial statements: They can audit them, review them, or compile them. Each procedure results in a marked difference in the level of assurance it adds to the financial statements.<p>


Federal law requires the annual financial statements of a public company to be audited by an independent CPA firm. Quite a few people think this means that the CPA firm independently determines the earnings and financial condition of the company in question. This is not the case. The information in the financial statements is the representation of management.<p>


An audit is a detailed assessment of the accounting system, accounting principles, and financial reporting standards used to create the financial statements. The results of an audit allow the CPA firm to express an opinion about the fairness with which the financial statements as a whole present the firm's financial position, the results of its operations, and its cash flows. While an audit does not guarantee the accuracy of financial statements, it does add significant credibility to management's representations.<p>


A CPA can also perform a more limited process called a review. A review is far less than an audit, providing a CPA with a basis of information about the financial report. However, review procedures are not a sufficient basis for the CPA to give an opinion as to whether or not the financial statements present a fair picture. The best a CPA can do based on a review is state that he or she is not aware of any changes that should be made in the financial statements to bring them into conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.<p>


Audits and reviews are procedures independent CPAs perform on the financial statements prepared by the business itself. Many small firms need help preparing financial statements. Such a company may hire a CPA to compile the financial statements from its records. A compilation is useful to management in monitoring the firm's progress, but it does not add credibility to the financial statements.<p>


Audits are expensive. In many business situations, the increased credibility of audited statements is not worth the added cost. Many, perhaps most, of the financial statements you will run across will be unaudited. Be careful with these. A CPA review provides only limited assurance that the statements are free from material misstatement; a compilation provides no assurance at all.<p>

<br>
<H3>What Accounting Methods Are Used?</H3><p>


That's right, management chooses the accounting methods. Financial statements should conform to generally accepted accounting principles. If they have been audited, they probably will. But within these principles, management can often select from a number of equally acceptable accounting methods.<p>


Does this mean that management can manipulate the numbers? In short, yes. Choosing aggressive accounting methods can result in financial statements that maximize reported profits and the value of shareholders' equity. These statements might be just right for impressing a loan officer or a potential buyer.<p>


Using the same facts and different accounting methods, management can report lower profits. This can be useful if management wants to minimize income tax liability and contributions to profit-sharing pension plans. Lower reported profits can also reduce the pressure from labor unions for richer contracts and from shareholders for higher dividends.<p>


Two accounting methods are especially important: the method of measuring the cost of goods sold, and the depreciation method.<p>


The cost of goods sold is usually a company's biggest expense. The method used to determine this expense can have a dramatic effect on the bottom line. This might seem like a straightforward calculation, and it would be if product costs were constant. Since most firms replenish their inventories of goods as sales are made, changes in product costs complicate matters. Generally accepted accounting principles allow four basic methods of calculating costs of sales. Two are widely used: last-in, first-out (LIFO); and first-in, first-out (FIFO).<p>


When costs are rising, FIFO produces higher reported profits. On the other hand, since profits are taxable, many firms choose LIFO to reduce income tax expense. Once LIFO is chosen, it must be used until the end of the product's life cycle. Eventually, at the end of the cycle, the LIFO method catches up with FIFO. This is because LIFO values unsold inventory at the lowest possible cost. When this inventory is finally sold, it will create a one-time gain in comparison with FIFO. But until the last year of production, the FIFO method results in higher reported profits and greater asset values than LIFO.<p>


<br>
<H3>Depreciation</H3><p>


The accrual principle creates an interesting problem in accounting for assets such as buildings and machines. Suppose our company buys a machine for $10,000 cash and plans to use it for 10 years. If the whole cost is taken as an expense in the year of purchase, earnings will be much lower (all else being equal) in that year than in the remaining nine years. To minimize this distortion of reported earnings, part of the machine's cost is recorded as an expense in each of the 10 years. This process of allocating the original cost of long-lived assets to the periods that benefit from them is called depreciation. Depreciation for the period is recorded as an expense on the income statement. The same amount is added to Accumulated Depreciation on the balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation is subtracted from the original cost of Property, Plant, and Equipment to arrive at the accounting value of this asset class.<p>


Many people find depreciation confusing because it is a non-cash expense. When our company spent $10,000 in cash to buy a $10,000 machine, it traded one asset for another of equal value. The only cash outflow was for the purchase of the machine. As the machine is used over its 10-year life, the accrual principle says that a portion of the purchase price should be recorded as an expense in each year, but these expenses do not represent additional cash outflows.<p>


According to generally accepted accounting principles, management should estimate the useful life of each asset and depreciate the asset over that period. Management's estimate of useful life can be highly subjective. In fact, different companies write off the same equipment over different time periods. Delta Air Lines depreciates its 727s over 15 years. Pan American estimates the useful life of its 727s at 25 years. This means that Pan Am's depreciation expense per plane is considerably lower than Delta's.<p>


Besides estimating the useful life of an asset, management also chooses the depreciation method. The most obvious way of depreciating the $10,000 machine discussed above would be to write off $1,000 per year for 10 years. This is known as the straight-line method. Management is free to use this approach but generally accepted accounting principles do not require it. Instead, management can choose one of several accelerated depreciation methods. These result in more depreciation expense early in an asset's life, and less later on.<p>


Management can even change depreciation methods. In 1984, IBM changed from accelerated to straight-line depreciation for certain assets. This change in accounting method boosted reported earnings by $375 million.<p>


Choices about depreciation and cost of goods sold can make a big difference in reported profit. Other accounting choices can be equally important, but these two will usually set the tone of a firm's financial statements. Companies that use long asset lives and FIFO are effectively signaling their intent to report profits and assets at the highest possible levels. Firms that choose LIFO and more rapid depreciation are holding profits down.<p>


<br>
<H3>The Fine Print</H3><p>


When management chooses accounting methods, it is effectively choosing the scale on which the facts about the firm's transactions will be weighed. The good news is that, under generally accepted accounting principles, management must tell us which methods it has used. This and other important information appear in the footnotes to the financial statements.<p>


Most of us view footnotes as supplementary information, to be read or not depending on our interest and inclination. In financial statements, footnotes are vital. They are an integral part of the financial statement. In fact, it is a good idea to study the footnotes first. That way, you will know about the firm's accounting choices and any changes in accounting policies when you read the numbers.<p>


Footnotes also disclose other important facts about a company's operations. These can include details about long-term lease liabilities, contingent liabilities, and pending lawsuits. Such disclosures can be as important as the numbers reported in the body of the financial statements.<p>


While generally accepted accounting principles require certain disclosures, there is no rule that footnotes must be clear. Many are not. When IBM changed its depreciation method in 1984, the footnote cited the vague justification of evolving changes in operations, maintenance costs and technology. Some footnotes use highly technical terms in legalistic sentence structures. These need careful reading.  Such footnotes can reveal important aspects of the financial story.<p>


<br>
<H3>Understanding Cash And Cash Flow</H3><p>


Cash is the first entry on the asset side of the balance sheet. Cash is cash, the stuff you use to pay debts. Obvious, you say. But it is amazing how often someone suggests dipping into retained earnings to solve the cash crunch at a financially distressed company. Retained earnings are not cash; they are part of stockholders' equity. They are claims against existing assets. You cannot spend retained earnings; you can spend cash.


Similar misconceptions surround cash flow. The cash flow statement summarizes a firm's true cash flows. The choice of accounting methods does not affect the cash flow statement except for the timing of income tax payments.<p>


In recent years, financial dilettantes and deal makers have added earnings and depreciation to derive cash flows from a company's income statement. Quite often, the rest of the conversation centers on how the cash flows calculated by this method can be used to pay interest on enough borrowed money to buy the business in question through a leveraged buyout.<p>


This formula approximates true cash flows in only a narrow set of circumstances, principally in businesses with stable operations. If they are applied to more dynamic businesses, they can encourage faulty judgments and imprudent investments.<p>


The example in Table 3 illustrates the importance of the distinction between this formula and true cash flow. Using the formula, earnings of $78,000 and depreciation of $36,000 produces a cash flow of $114,000. However, true cash flow from operations, $55,000, is less than half this amount. Most of the difference comes from increases in inventory and accounts receivable. The example is one of a growing company. Such firms often need larger inventories to support increasing sales. By the same token, some of the increased sales will be credit sales, increasing accounts receivable. Looking further down the cash flow statement, the company has invested a sizable amount in new equipment. The firm also borrowed money and sold more stock to raise cash.<p>

<hr>
<br>

The naive formula applied to the income statement implies substantial cash flow. The cash flow statement tells a different story. The firm's earnings are strong, but it must plow all its earned cash and more into the business to fund its strong growth.<p>

<br>
<H3>What About Fraud?</H3><p>


Auditors are very good at what they do. Very few fraudulent financial statements slip through, but it does happen. Frauds where two or more high-level managers collaborate to cheat the business and lie to the auditors are difficult to detect. Such frauds usually involve either manipulation of inventory and accounts receivable or related-party transactions.<p>


For instance, an investigative committee of MiniScribe's outside directors reported that the computer disk drive company's senior management had perpetrated a massive fraud on the company, its directors, its outside auditors, and the investing public. Among other frauds, MiniScribe generated false revenues by shipping disk drives to its own warehouses and booking the shipments as sales. Senior company officials also inflated assets by carrying large quantities of obsolete parts, scrap and defective disk drives in its inventory. The investigative committee also found that MiniScribe executives perpetrated a series of frauds directly on the auditors. In one case, senior company officials apparently broke into locked trunks containing auditors workpapers and changed inventory figures.<p>


Transactions between audited and unaudited companies with overlapping ownership can hide fraud from auditors. If firms are essentially members of a broader family of companies, intercompany transactions can obscure the financial status of any member. This type of fraud caused the 1985 collapse of ESM Government Securities Inc. ESM Government's financial statements were audited, but those of related companies were not. Fictitious transactions between the firm and its holding company, ESM Group Inc., allowed it to hide huge losses. The entire ESM family of companies had been insolvent for at least six years when a customer questioned a footnote on ESM Government's 1984 balance sheet. Further inquiries detected a fraud that cost customers and investors over $300 million.<p>


MiniScribe and ESM Government both had clean audits from reputable CPA firms. Often, lawyers and businessmen must work with unaudited financial statements. Unaudited statements may comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Or they may not. Honest and knowledgeable managers may prepare statements that contain honest errors. Dishonest managers can cook the books in any number of ways. Read unaudited statements cautiously, and ask management to clarify anything that seems out of the ordinary. Try to get independent verification of critical items. An experienced CPA or financial consultant can help spot possible problems, but even with this kind of help, relying on unaudited financial statements adds a risk to a transaction.<p>

<br>
<H3>THE BOTTOM LINE</H3><p>


As an individual investor scrutinizing a company as an investment possibility, your first priority should be to understand how a specific set of financial statements is put together, including the accounting methods chosen and any important disclosures. Once you have done this, make the following comparisons:<p>

<ul>
<li> How do the financial statements of the firm you are concerned about compare with those of other companies in the same industry?<p>


<li> Are asset lives longer than average for the industry? If so, maybe the firm is squeezing to report extra profit.<p>


<li> Is the ratio of accounts receivable to sales revenue higher than the industry average? If so, has the firm made adequate provision for uncollectible accounts? A number of publications provide industry data. These include the Moody's Manuals, Standard & Poor's Industry Surveys, and the Value Line Investment Survey.<p>


<li> Compare the firm's current financial statements with those from previous years. Are inventories and receivables growing much faster than sales? This could be a danger signal. Investigate further.<p>


<li> Are general and administrative expenses growing faster than profits? Maybe management is getting fat.<p>
</ul>

These are a few suggestions. The right comparisons will suggest themselves as you dig into the financial statements.<p>


Financial statements are not easy reading, but they are must reading for individual investors. The information in this article should give you a good start in analyzing financial statements. As you read more financial statements, you will add to your knowledge.<p>


And if you develop an educated nose, you will not swallow anything harmful.<p>

Part of being an adult in our culture is knowing how to use money wisely. And, as with other fundamental issues, it is best if one starts acquiring knowledge at a young age. Recognizing this, many parents wrestle with the issue of how to teach financial responsibility to their children.<P>


The task is a challenge in part because it is so difficult to get good sensible information about how to manage one's own money. Consider the sources of information typically available to a young person growing up in our culture:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Families, who often are reluctant to discuss money with their children;<P>


<LI>Television, which presents a fantasy land where financial limits and financial differences don't occur;<P>


<LI>Newspapers and magazines, which receive substantial advertising revenue from companies promoting an array of often confusing products in advertisements that purport to impart investment information;<P>


<LI>The government, which doesn't do much to advertise tax rates, but does have active advertising campaigns for lotteries;<P>


<LI>Ordinary gossip, which tends to focus on those extraordinary, mythical-sized portfolio gains rather than on the down-to-earth stuff that works. Who would ever brag about living within their income, or saving regularly?; and<P>


<LI>The apparent "good life," led by people, who like our government, are living over their income.<P>
</UL>

While appearances are enticing, the harsh financial realities of high debt and of meager savings for retirement are not visible to a young person looking around for cues about how the world works. All a young person sees are the fancy clothes, the expensive cars, and the big house.<P>


In light of this, how can financial management skills be instilled across the generations?<P>


According to educators, learning about money not only happens best when exposure starts early, but also when responsibility comes in steadily increasing, age-appropriate steps. In other words, kids need to have the world--the real world of financial limits, choices, and consequences--made visible and accessible to them from an early age, in ever-larger doses.<P>


At younger ages, it is important to have lots of hands-on experiences. By about age four, kids are ripe for learning about the world beyond themselves, especially handling transactions, contributing to family outings, and noticing different jobs in the community.<P>


Upper-elementary-age kids are ready to have responsibility that increases slowly but steadily; they need to make a lot of mistakes. Teenagers and young adults are ready to consolidate the earlier experience of knowing what money can buy and how to make choices, and thus gain a sense of empowerment, control, and self-esteem.<P>


At all stages, the process is important: It's worth the time and effort to let children come to their own decisions, and it's not only OK, but useful for them to make mistakes. Throughout this steadily increasing experience with money, kids can also benefit from opportunities to compare experiences with people in other generations. These opportunities to compare experiences can open up refreshingly frank conversations about a family's values.<P>


How can any individual family make use of these sensible but highly theoretical views?<P>


While there is plenty of financial illiteracy throughout the land, there are also many families who are successfully and happily transmitting habits of sound financial management to their children. The following list of ideas comes from a cross-section of teachers, parents, and now-adult children responding to the simple question: "With respect to teaching financial responsibility, what have you seen or experienced that works?"<P>


Use the list as a starting point for a wealth of experiences for your own family. Experiment with the ideas that appeal to you. And share the ideas with your family.<P>


<H3>Currency Recognition</H3>

<UL>
<LI>While waiting in a store--for example, at restaurants--play with coins. Invent games: Which ones are the nickels? How can you make 25 cents in different ways? How much money is there? Which coins are worth more? Make piles of equal amounts.<P>


<LI>Let a child choose between a row of eight pennies squished together and a row of five pennies all spread out. (Children who choose the longest row, instead of the most coins, aren't ready to learn much about coins yet. Talk to them about fast-food equivalents--see next section.)<P>


<LI>Money Calendar: Substitute coins for days. Calculate fewest number of coins to represent the date.<P>


<LI>Make a game of remembering which famous person is on each currency.<P>


<LI>Let children put coins in parking meters and vending machines.<P>


<LI>Let children handle purchase transactions at stores; ask older children to estimate the change due.<P>
</UL>

<H3>Learning What Money Can Buy</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Express costs in terms of equivalent meals at fast food restaurants, family vacations, or ice cream treats. Children who aren't ready for coins and bills can grasp the concept "That toy costs as much as a burger-and-fries, while the other one costs about three burgers-and-fries."<P>


<LI>Make a project of comparing the cost of ice cream from the ice cream truck versus the cost of ice cream in a package from the grocery store.<P>


<LI>Have a pretend catalog shopping spree, e.g., what would you buy with $500? Children can paste pictures, record costs (including tax, shipping, and handling for older children), and think creatively to reach exact amount.<P>


<LI>At restaurants, ask children to work within a budget when ordering from the menu. Older children can figure the tax and tip.<P>


<LI>Calculate the difference between plain jeans and designer jeans. As kids get older, give them responsibility for contributing all or part of the increase in price due to style.<P>


<LI>Make a game of analyzing ads: Is it a bargain to buy something on sale if you don't want it? Is 25% off of an excessive price a good deal? Do you think that toy really does everything it did on TV?<P>


<LI>Analyze a pay stub. Figure out how many months of income go toward taxes.<P>


<LI>Use the grocery store as a rich learning place: Ask kids to find the best value in, for example, paper towels. Buy several cereals and compare quantity, price, ads, and taste. And ask, why are those candy bars displayed at the cash register?<P>


<LI>Calculate how much you could save by buying in quantity. Make a list of product and brand names that your family uses often enough to be worthwhile as a quantity purchase. Calculate savings and make a family decision about how to spend the money--offer a parental reward for good shopping.<P>


<LI>Challenge kids to lower the utility bill and offer to share the savings with them.<P>


<LI>Give older children responsibility for purchasing within a budget some segment of weekly groceries--for example, the family's afternoon snacks--or weekly contribution to a food pantry.<P>


<LI>Teach young teenagers how to write checks by asking them to write out the household bill payments on some rotating schedule. (Kids who do this know that when a person rents an apartment, there's also a monthly utility bill!)<P>
</UL>

<H3>Learning What Work Can Earn</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Encourage older children to look for small jobs in the neighborhood, including paper routes, baby-sitting, mowing/shoveling, and pet care.<P>


<LI>Make the lemonade-stand concept a little more realistic. At least have a conversation about the cost of raw materials and rent and about how a marketing plan involves something other than shouting at strangers or humiliating the neighbors into making double purchases.<P>


<LI>Talk about what it means to be a good employee and a good employer.<P>


<LI>Make a game of figuring out what different jobs are like. What do different jobs pay? What education is required? What makes a job attractive? What's the trade-off between leisure time, money, and personal satisfaction? (Getting two out of three is pretty good!)<P>


<LI>Volunteer activities can start young. They can also provide experience and references.<P>


<LI>Write a contract between parents and kids. For example: "For completing the job ________, I'll earn ________. The job is complete when ________."<P>


<LI>Make a game of planning an imaginary business: What is the product? What would your expenses be? How would you advertise it?<P>


<LI>Discuss local businesses: Which ones are good and why? What would you do if you were the business person when, for example, something defective is sold, the customer is rude, you run out of inventory, or a big competitor moves in next door? What would be a good new business?<P>
</UL>

<H3>Learning to Make Choices</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Look for small experiments with choice for young children: Pick one treat from this store. Pick three rides at the state fair. Pick three outfits from the five that fit. Let young kids pick a treat or choose a friend's birthday present, within a stated budget. Give very young children substitute money experiences--for instance, homemade tickets redeemable for candy or treats for as long as they last (two tickets per week, for example).<P>


<LI>For older children, make a budget for back-to-school clothes: take inventory, discuss needs, comparison shop, give choices to the child as much as possible.<P>


<LI>As children grow, look for ways to steadily increase the time and scope over which a child budgets, starting out from, "You have 25 cents, which candy do you want?" through "If you want those jeans, you'll need to contribute $10 or x number of weeks of allowance."<P>


<LI>Continue to expand the time and responsibility covered by a child's allowance. For example, graduate from the nickel that usually gets lost, through 50 cents for snacks and treats, through several dollars per week with responsibility for holiday and birthday gifts, through more money each week with responsibility for some part of clothing purchases or entertainment. It's not how much money children get; it's how much responsibility they are given!<P>


<LI>Until the toy manufacturers come out with a developmentally appropriate piggy bank, make your own: Get a change box from the local hardware store and some small plastic bags. Help your child set up one bag for each type of goal. For example, the "spend" bag for fun impulse purchases, the "save" bag for longer-term purchases such as holiday gifts, a "charity" bag for charitable contributions that your child controls, and an "add-only" bank for long-term, college-education-type savings. Jointly develop a budget for the weekly allowance, so a child can see that so much money goes into each bag each week. Give the weekly allowance in a timely manner and with sufficient enough coins and bills so that your child can physically proportion the correct amount of income into each bag. This hands-on savings bank imprints sound budgeting principles and helps a child to be in control of his budget.<P>


<LI>Involve children in research for a major purchase--for example, a bicycle or the family washing machine. Compare prices, research brands, watch for sales, look in second-hand shops. Be specific about what you want, weigh assembling and installing it yourself versus paying for assembly or installation, talk with other consumers, use library resources, consider test drives, evaluate the ongoing need for service, consider paying by credit, and, of course, consider how badly you really want to buy it.<P>


<LI>Give college students a budget and let them have any money remaining at graduation.<P>


<LI>Urge teenagers to use their own credit card for practice in paying off a balance in full each month.<P>

</UL>

Families who have tried these ideas tend to have two important results. The first is the realization that letting children make mistakes is not only OK, but it is the main goal.<P>


At first, letting children order junk from a catalog, make inappropriate impulse purchases, or spend their whole allowance on candy can feel strange. But remember the lessons from sports coaches: "Give your child the gift of failure. Stress process, not outcome. Teach coping skills. Reframe adversity; provide a perspective. Use simulation daily." Veering off a budget at age 10 is good protection against real money problems later on in life. Mistakes also provide a good opportunity to share one of your bloopers, reinforcing the notion that "we're all in this together."<P>


The second important result is a refreshing shift in the relationship between parent and child. Children who have clear and gradually expanding boundaries within which they are free to manage money tend to stop begging for more money or more treats. Children who know they have a piece of turf to manage in their own way try hard to figure out how best to use their resources.<P>


So, heave a sigh of relief (and beam with pride) as you realize that your child has moved away from begging for treats toward standing in front of the candy display, shifting feet and biting lips, trying to weigh just how attractive that candy really is.<P>

Investing With Asset Allocation Mutual Funds  </H2><P>
<HR>

The benefits of spreading holdings among the three basic asset classes--stocks, bonds, and cash--has become evident to many investors. What is not so evident is how to accomplish this allocation.<P>


If you are not inclined toward the do-it-yourself approach of combining individual selections in each category, one possibility is to consider all-weather mutual funds that perform this task for you. Three types of mutual funds are designed to spread their money over different asset classes: asset allocation funds, balanced funds, and funds of funds.<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Asset Allocation Funds:</STRONG> These funds initially establish predefined percentage ranges for their holdings of stocks, bonds, and cash. They also may mix in the shares of some inflation-resistant companies, including gold producers, natural resource and energy companies, and real estate investment trusts. They then make adjustments in their weights as market conditions change.<P>


Most of these funds have a global orientation and include foreign as well as domestic securities in their portfolios. This diversifies the investment mix across stock markets and currencies as well as sectors--including emerging market debt and equity.<P>


Most multi-asset portfolio managers will gradually adjust the category weights as relative asset class valuations--or market outlooks--change, reallocating perhaps 10% to 20% of the portfolio at a time. <P>


Individual funds can differ greatly, so each portfolio you consider has to be analyzed carefully. How they manage their stocks, how they structure their bonds, and the extent to which they invest in foreign securities are among the important variables.<P>


Performance and other data for eight no-load asset allocation portfolios are reported in the table at the end of this article, which contains comparative performance numbers for the Vanguard 500 Fund, an index fund that replicates the Standard & Poor's 500. The most striking fact revealed by these figures is the heterogeneity of the group in terms of assets, expense ratios, performance, and volatility.<P>


In theory, asset allocation funds should decline less than the S&P 500 during market corrections, since they are diversified in other asset classes. The market was not off that badly in the first half of 1994, although it is interesting to see how the group fared during our recent correction. Six of the eight slid further than the 3.5% decline in the Vanguard 500. That's because most of the asset groups these funds work with slipped in tandem during the first half of the year, which is not that common.<P>


Standard deviation is the best measure of portfolio volatility for asset allocation funds. Standard deviation measures the amount actual returns varied around the average; a higher standard deviation indicates higher volatility. All the funds in the table have lower standard deviations than the Vanguard 500's 9.9%, ranging from 5.3% to 8.2%.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Balanced Funds:</STRONG> These portfolios trace their roots back to the 1920s and 1930s. They split their holdings between stocks and bonds according to a benchmark stock/bond ratio, such as 60/40. Generally, a balanced fund would hold at least 25% of its assets in bonds and 25% in stocks. Some place more emphasis on equities, others lean toward bonds.<P>


Balanced funds also include modest cash holdings and may mix in some convertible securities and preferred stock. They may also include a modest amount of foreign securities. The typical balanced portfolio sticks much more closely to a predefined mix than the usual asset allocation fund, so its performance tends to relate more directly to the returns on bonds and stocks than to the manager's forecasting ability. Although the group has traditionally been conservative, individual funds sometimes dabble in smaller stocks and long-duration bonds to try to enhance returns.<P>


Balanced funds generally performed very well during most of the 1980s and the early 1990s because there was a strong bull market in bonds as well as stocks. Investors should not expect such generous returns over the next decade or so.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Funds of Funds:</STRONG> These portfolios invest in other mutual funds with varying objectives including growth stocks, U.S. government bonds, foreign stocks, and so on. These types of funds would appeal to the first-time investor or to those with limited assets looking for one-stop diversification.<P>
</UL>

There are two basic ways in which all-weather funds can be used by individuals.<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>An All-In-One Investment:</STRONG> Generally asset allocation funds, balanced funds, and funds of funds are appropriate for individuals who want to invest a substantial portion (or even all) of their assets in a single fund. These people may be looking for convenience--perhaps they don't like keeping track of individual funds and don't want to be involved in building their own portfolios and adjusting positions. <P>


All-weather funds could also be an attractive alternative for parents saving for a child's college education who want to use one broadly diversified, stable fund to accumulate the savings. However, if the child is very young and you're looking at 15 or more years to build the assets, straight equity funds are generally best.<P>


<LI><STRONG>A Portfolio "Core":</STRONG> Some people may want to use an asset allocation fund as a core holding amounting to about 30% to 40% of their total investment assets. They can then tailor their portfolio to their own circumstances, adding several other funds that invest in areas that the asset allocation fund doesn't include, such as municipal bonds. Funds targeting areas that the asset allocation fund does include but that the individual wants to give more emphasis to could also be added. With the core approach, you can hold your portfolio to a more manageable number of funds, while the asset allocation fund is making gradual adjustments for you based on changing market conditions.<P>
</UL>

All-weather funds are not for everyone. All-in-one funds would not ordinarily be as appropriate for larger investors who are already spreading their money across, say, eight to 20 different funds. Asset allocation funds make it more difficult for individuals who wish to determine their own percentage allocations to keep track of their current portfolio breakdowns. The larger the size of your portfolio and the more involved you are with your investments, the more advisable it becomes to make your own all-weather portfolio.<P>


If you should decide to invest in one or more of the all-weather funds, keep these guidelines in mind.<P>

<UL>
<LI>The most flexible asset allocation funds are simply aggressive market timers. Market timing generally doesn't work and leads to high portfolio turnover and significant tax consequences. Look for mutual funds that make more modest, gradual adjustments in their allocations.<P>


<LI>Watch out for mutual funds that appear to be overly cautious, always holding large positions in Treasury bills and precious metals. Their long-run total returns could be inadequate.<P>


<LI>Try to determine whether the manager actively selects stocks or merely attempts to track the performance of an index, such as the S&P 500. Funds that base the equity portion of their assets on an index are more conservative. If the stock component is actively managed, you want to know something about the manager's stock-picking ability.<P>


<LI>Examine the stock and bond portions individually. Morningstar provides separate style boxes for the stock and bond components of the asset allocation and balanced funds it tracks. You can see the size of stocks the manager emphasizes, any growth or value orientation, and the average maturity and credit quality of the bonds.<P>


<LI>Since some people place a big chunk of their long-term money into an asset allocation portfolio, top-quality management is essential. These funds are difficult to run. The manager has to decide not only how to weight the different groups, but also what securities to buy within each diverse group. Some funds have several managers who each specialize in a particular area.<P>


<LI>If you're planning on investing a substantial sum in an asset allocation fund, you need to be particularly careful. It would be advisable to split the investment between the two best funds you can find. That way you are not betting the ranch on a single manager (or team) and you'll probably experience lower volatility.<P>


<LI>Watch the expense ratio. Asset allocation funds tend to have above-average expenses. The average expense ratio for the asset allocation funds tracked by Morningstar is 1.46%, which is above the 1.17% average for its entire mutual fund universe. Expenses will be more crucial with the prospects of more modest stock and bond returns during the next decade or so.<P>

Keeping Pace With the Market: A Guide to Index Funds </H2><P>
<HR>

If you can't beat it, join it--the stock market, that is, as defined by an index.<P>


That is an oversimplification of the index fund concept. But apparently many investors are buying in to the idea--the popularity of these funds has grown enormously over the past few years, and the number of index funds has proliferated.<P>


A stock index fund is designed to track a stock market index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500, by either owning all or a statistically representative sample of the securities in the index. They are referred to as "passively managed" funds because there are no active investment decisions made.<P>


Index funds have several practical advantages over actively managed funds. First, because there are no real investment decisions that must be made, management fees can be extremely low, and expenses held down.<P>


In addition, portfolio turnover should be low, since the only sales and purchases that are made are those necessary for the fund to stay fully invested in the proper proportions to mirror the index being tracked. This keeps transaction costs low. For individuals investing with taxable money, a low portfolio turnover results in fewer taxable capital gains distributions.<P>


To outperform an index fund without added risk, an active manager must better the index by an amount greater than his additional expenses and transaction costs.<P>


Finally, active management can skew a portfolio toward a particular market segment. An index fund that tracks a broad-based index is, by definition, truly diversified. And it is always fully invested in the market.<P>


The concept sounds simple to implement. With so many seemingly similar funds to choose from, does it matter which one you pick?<P>


Needless to say, there are a number of considerations.<P>


Probably the most important consideration is the index that you want to track. By far the most popular index among the funds is the Standard & Poor's 500, an index that emphasizes large capitalization companies and represents about 70% of the U.S. stock market. One advantage to an investor choosing this is the wide availability of information on the S&P 500, including the stocks composing it and its performance. Another advantage is that it enables the fund manager to use S&P 500 stock index futures to provide liquidity for fund redemptions, yet remain fully invested in the stock market index.<P>


Other indexes are also followed. Some of these are not as easy to track by individuals as the S&P 500, such as the Schwab 1000, or an index of the 80 to 100 largest stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Several index funds track small-stock indexes, which can be independently followed. Three index funds cover international indexes.<P>


Finally, several index funds track specific market sectors. While these funds have "index" in their names, they are more useful to investors interested in sector funds and are not listed here.<P>


Clearly, from their names most of these indexes cover a large number of stocks. That doesn't necessarily mean that the index fund owns every single stock in the index. Instead, many use a "statistically select" group of stocks that are representative of the index as a whole. The funds most likely to use statistical sampling rather than complete representation are those that track a large number of stocks, and those that have a smaller amount of assets under management, in particular the newer funds.<P>


Obviously, the more successful the fund is at statistical sampling, the better. And the only way to check this is to see how closely the fund's performance parallels the index it is tracking. If the sampling is done properly, the fund should underperform the index by an amount greater than but close to its expense ratio (transaction costs further reduce performance). The newer the fund, the more difficult it is to determine this.<P>


Whether the fund invests in all the stocks or some, the biggest single indicator of how closely the fund will track the index is the expense ratio.<P>


In concept, the expense ratio of an index fund should be very low--that's one of the main reasons for investing in a fund of this type. Yet a glance at many index funds indicates that these ratios do vary.<P>


Why the differences? Part of this is due variations in fund size. Economies of scale are very important to index funds, and in general, the larger the fund, the lower the expense ratio. In addition, the size of the management fees vary. <P>


Competition among the index funds has caused many expense ratios to drop. Some of these funds are doing this by waiving part or all of the management fees and administrative expenses. If you invest in a fund that keeps its expenses low by waiving fees, it is important to keep a close eye on the waiver renewals--they are spelled out in the prospectus of the fund, and in the footnotes to the fund's annual report.<P>


Expense ratios can also be lowered by imposing other fees on shareholders that go directly to the fund, for example, a redemption fee for sales within the first six months. These fees are also designed to discourage continuous trading of fund shares, which increases transaction costs within the fund.<P>


It is important to consider how other fees and charges may apply to you. If you intend to remain invested in a fund longer than six months, the redemption fees may be of little concern, but if you want to switch frequently, they should be avoided. If you plan to invest only a small amount in an index fund, you should take into consideration the impact of any annual maintenance fees.<P>


One final item investors may want to consider is investor switching. Long-term investors may be better off with a fund that takes steps to discourage frequent switching, which can raise transaction costs and expense ratios, since the fund must sell shares to raise cash and to rebalance the fund to reflect the index. Some funds can lessen this impact by using stock index futures.<P>


To discourage switching, some funds charge fees for telephone exchanges; other funds do not allow telephone exchanges, and still others impose redemption fees that disappear after six months. Market timers, of course, would want to avoid these funds.<P>


Despite the many choices of index funds, there are clear differences. When choosing among the various funds, consider the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Make sure you know which index you want to track.<P>


<LI>Check the expense ratio of the fund--it should be below 0.50%.<P>


<LI>Check to see if the expense ratio is low due to fee waivers, and if so, see when those waivers are due to expire.<P>


<LI>Check for any other fees or charges that may affect your planned investment.<P>


<LI>If you are a long-term stock market investor, see if the fund discourages short-term switching. This may benefit you in the long run by holding down fund expenses.<P>


<LI>If you want to engage in market timing, which is not recommended, make sure the fund allows telephone exchanges at no charge and with no limitations.<P>


<LI>Check the portfolio turnover rate to make sure the fund's transaction costs are held down.<P>
</UL>

An examination of these characteristics should help you narrow down the list of index funds and help you pick the fund that best suits your needs.<P>

The Passive Approach to Investing Via Index Funds </H2><P>
<HR>

Index funds are passively run portfolios that target specific market benchmarks, such as the S&P 500. Why have they become so popular with investors?<P>


Probably the main reason is that more investors have learned that it's difficult to select long-run winners. Index funds provide an alternative to dependence on an active manager's investment style, which may underperform the market, and which comes at a higher cost.<P>


Before investing in an index fund, you should see how well it has tracked its target index. This is difficult to do with some of the newer index funds, but you should at least be able to make some inferences as to how well it will track the benchmark in the future. Not all index funds track their benchmarks that closely.<P>


True index funds exhibit predictable performance, are always fully invested, have low expense ratios and low portfolio turnover rates and, as a consequence, are tax efficient.<P>


The difference between the performance of an index fund and the index itself is due to two factors: whether the fund takes the whole universe of the index or a sample, and the fund's expense ratio. Some indexes, such as the Wilshire 5000 include over 6,800 firms, so a fund would invest in a sampling of, say, 1,700 stocks from the index. The higher the expense ratio, the greater the degree to which a fund trails its benchmark.<P>


Today's index funds offer a broad array of choices. The first consideration you face in selecting index funds is to select the index you want to track.<P>


Big-cap stock index funds generally target the S&P 500 index. Broad market index funds might target the Wilshire 5000 index, while mid-sized index funds may track the S&P MidCap 400 index or the Wilshire 4500 index. Small-stock index funds might track the Russell 2000 index.<P>


You will also find index funds that concentrate on a particular industry, as well as index funds that focus on the international market or the bond market. Finally, there are  tax-efficient portfolios, which try to control their capital gains a little more than a regular index fund by giving their managers more leeway.<P>


There are three alternate routes you can take in building your mutual fund portfolio.<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>All Passive.</STRONG> It's not difficult to build a balanced, global mutual fund portfolio consisting exclusively of index funds. Good index funds can be bought and held for decades with the assurance that you will be doing better than the majority of actively managed portfolios. However, you forego the opportunity of selecting some top performers.<P>


<LI><STRONG>An Indexed Core.</STRONG> The core approach--which is popular with large pension funds--offers a nice compromise. Broadly diversified index funds are useful as core holdings amounting to anywhere from 30% to 50% or more of a portfolio. Using the core as a base, you would add actively managed funds that you feel could beat the market or provide some other unique advantage, such as the tax-free income of a single-state municipal bond portfolio. One investor may choose to maintain a position in a Wilshire 5000 portfolio as a permanent part of his asset mix. Another individual with a larger portfolio may decide to include three index funds in her core: an S&P 500 portfolio, a small-cap fund, and an international fund.<P>


<LI><STRONG>All Active.</STRONG> Perhaps the index concept bores you. And, of course, there may be opportunities for astute fund managers to add value in relatively inefficient sectors of the market, such as small domestic and foreign stocks. However, if you choose the all-active route, be sure you don't inadvertently engage in "closet" indexing. This refers to the situation that may occur if you hold, say, several large-cap funds--representing both growth and value styles--that, when viewed as a whole, perform like an index fund. The disadvantage here is the higher expenses of actively managed funds. To avoid closet indexing consider replacing these large-cap funds with an S&P 500 portfolio.<P>
</UL>

Here are some points to keep in mind if you're shopping for index funds and building them into your asset mix.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Examine the expense ratio. With the exception of the international portfolios, it's best to stick with index funds that have expense ratios below 0.5%--otherwise you're not gaining the main advantage of indexing. If expenses are capped temporarily by a fee waiver, don't be caught by surprise when it expires.<P>


<LI>If you're planning to invest the minimum, be aware of the consequences of any fixed account maintenance fees. Some funds charge a $10 annual account maintenance fee. <P>


<LI>Examine the portfolio turnover. True, passive index funds have turnover rates of 5% to 10% or less. However, the composition of some benchmarks--in particular bond indexes--frequently changes and higher turnovers are normal as the manager adjusts the make-up of the fund to that changing composition. <P>


<LI>Take note of redemption fees and switching limitations. Make sure there is not a conflict between these restrictions and your time frame. Index funds are not recommended for in-and-out traders.<P>


<LI>The magnitude of the ratio of net investment income to average assets (which is found in the "financial highlights" table in the prospectus) is an important determinant of the tax efficiency of any fund, including indexed portfolios. This ratio would be lower for a small-stock portfolio than an S&P 500 portfolio, making the former more tax-efficient than the latter, all else equal.<P>


<LI>In general, if you invest in a mix of index and actively-managed funds, index funds are best-suited for your taxable accounts, and your less tax-efficient holdings are better suited for your tax-deferred retirement plans. A tax-managed index fund could be particularly appropriate for a large investor in the highest tax bracket.<P>


<LI>Be wary of "enhanced"  index funds. If you see a portfolio that calls itself an index fund, but does not have all the major characteristics of one, it's probably not true-blue. Some enhanced index funds may strive to beat a particular index by trying to predict which stocks in the benchmark will deliver the best performance and overweight those issues while underweighting or excluding others. If an index fund tries to outperform its benchmark, it can't be a true passive portfolio. Make sure you understand what you're buying.<P>

Up Funds That Invest in Real Estate </H2><P>
<HR>

Asset allocation means finding an appropriate mix of investments among the major asset categories. Usually, the major asset categories are defined to be stocks, bonds, and cash. Real estate is often ignored in the equation.<p>


That's likely to change, however, because it's now easier than ever to include that asset class in your investment mix, considering the tremendous growth in the real estate investment trust (or "REIT") sector of the equity markets over the past several years, and the growth of mutual funds that invest in them.<p>


Lipper Analytical Services now tracks 24 real estate funds with total net assets of over $1.5 billion. That compares with just five of these specialized funds with assets of $118 million at the end of 1990. More recently, the majority of real estate mutual funds have moved most of their assets into REITs, which offer a pure play on real estate.<p>


The no-load mutual-fund route is an ideal way to include a small slice of real estate in your investment pie and--among other things--allows you to hold that asset category within an IRA or other sheltered retirement account. REITs have performed comparably to stocks in general over the past two decades and can offer significantly higher income than an S&P 500 portfolio.<p>

<br>
<H3>Why Real Estate?</H3>


Real estate is a major asset category that is often ignored because, at least until recently, it has been difficult for individual investors to enter in a practical and useful fashion.<p>


However, because of a fundamental shift in the way commercial real estate is being financed, there's now a stronger case than ever for diversifying a portfolio with real estate securities. The major change has been the growth of the real estate investment trust. Although REITs have been around since the early 1960s, they began to play a greatly expanded role in the 1990s as the industry's predominate vehicle for raising capital.<p>

<br>
<H3>REIT Background</H3>


To understand how real estate funds work, you need to understand a little bit about REITs. Here is a brief summary of some basic points to keep in mind when examining mutual funds that invest in REITs:<p>

<UL>
<LI>A REIT is similar to a closed-end fund and over 80% of all trusts trade on an exchange or on Nasdaq. These vehicles pool investors' money, using professional managers to supervise a portfolio of properties, mortgages or both, depending on the objective.<p>


<li> On average, REITs are getting larger in size, but they still remain fairly small, with the average market capitalization of the industry weighing in at about $200 million, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), the industry's Washington-based trade group. The 20 largest REITs have market capitalizations ranging from about $500 million to $1.2 billion.<p>


<li> The majority of the industry's growth has occurred in the equity-REIT category. These REITs invest directly in real property; they receive rental income and lease payments, and occasionally realize capital gains from selling properties. REIT shares have growth as well as income characteristics because their dividends grow and the values of properties tend to increase with inflation. Conversely, mortgage REITs make loans to real estate owners and collect interest payments; these trusts are sensitive to the credit quality of the borrower. Hybrid trusts hold both property and mortgages.<p>


<li> REITs have experienced considerable popularity in the last few years and there have been many IPOs as well as secondary or follow-on equity offerings. The primary reason for the unprecedented number of IPOs and the increasing size of existing REITs is that they are now playing a major role in the financing of real estate. This fact, in turn, has stimulated the introduction of the new real estate mutual funds.<p>


<li> REITs characteristically have high dividend yields, which recently have been about the same as yields on 10-year Treasury notes. The high yields make REITs interest-rate sensitive like utility stocks and other financial companies, since high-yielding equity investments compete with fixed-income securities for investor money.<p>


<li> REITs have performed roughly in line with stocks over the long term, and in fact, equity REITs outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 20 years.<p>
</ul>
<br>
<H3>Real Estate Mutual Funds </H3>


Real estate mutual funds normally have diversified holdings in many states and a few of them even take a global slant. The typical real estate fund gives representation to all major property types by targeting real estate equities, primarily REITs. Other investments include related companies such as home builders and building supply manufacturers. In addition, they may hold the stocks of companies in other industries with substantial real estate holdings. By investing in publicly traded stocks rather than properties directly, real estate portfolios offer investors the liquidity characteristic of funds.<p>


Table 1 lists the no-load real estate funds, along with selected data on each. These funds are usually much more income-oriented than the typical sector portfolio, as indicated by the relatively high income ratios on the CGM, Cohen & Steers, Columbia, Fidelity and PRA funds.<p>

Not all real estate funds have such high income ratios, however. Evergreen Global Real Estate has only a 0.74% ratio because the types of foreign real estate stocks it invests in are not high yielding. This fund has had a relatively low percentage of its assets invested in REITs--it is much more a play in foreign markets. Some other real estate funds, such as Evergreen U.S. Real Estate, may also rank long-term capital growth ahead of current income.<p>


As mentioned earlier, REITs are small stocks. The median market capitalization of a real estate fund's holdings is a good indicator of the size of companies it targets. These numbers range from about $220 million to slightly more than $500 million. The median market capitalization of the average real estate fund in Table 1 is under 2.5% of the $13.7 billion median market capitalization of the big-cap-dominated Vanguard Index Trust 500 portfolio.<p>


Fidelity Real Estate Investment, the largest and oldest of the group, had more than 89% of its assets in REITs at the end of January, 1995. The biggest categories represented were shopping centers, apartments, malls, and industrial buildings. The fund is managed by Barry Greenfield, who has been at the helm since its November 1986 inception. From that time to year end 1994, the fund produced an 8.96% annualized total return compared with an 8.26% annual return on the NAREIT Equity REIT index over that same period.<p>


Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, another large portfolio, recently had nearly 94% of its assets in REITs, including large stakes in shopping centers, apartments, and office and industrial buildings. Martin Cohen and Robert Steers, who co-manage the fund, also oversee two closed-end real estate funds.<p>


The relatively new CGM Realty is run by Kenneth Heebner, the well-known Boston-based fund manager. Heebner, who is enthusiastic about the potential for real estate securities, started the fund in May of 1994. The major sectors in its portfolio at year end 1994 were apartments, hotels, office and industrial buildings, and self storage. CGM Mutual, a $1 billion balanced fund also managed by Heebner had a 25% stake in REITs at the end of last year.<p>


Table 2 provides annual and five-year annualized total returns on a group of no-load real estate funds, compared with Lipper's general equity fund average and the NAREIT equity index. REITs and the average real estate fund fared well in 1991, 1992, and 1993, although the average fund did badly in 1990 when the REIT bear market bottomed out late that year, on the heels of one of the worst real estate slides in U.S. history. Lipper's general equity funds were down only 5.7% in 1990 in contrast to the 15.35% decline in the NAREIT equity index and even steeper declines in three of the four funds in existence at that time.<p>

Global real estate funds such as Evergreen Global Real Estate are quite different from the portfolios with a domestic orientation, and it is not appropriate to compare the performances of the former with the latter. Note the sharp contrast between the fund's 51.42% gain in 1993 and its 14.05% loss in 1994. The fund's poor performance in 1994 was due in part to negative investor sentiment on foreign markets resulting from factors such as the Mexican peso crisis. Non-U.S. real estate securities provide dramatically different investment characteristics than their domestic counterparts.<p>


Management makes a great deal of difference with a real estate fund--there is more opportunity to add value here than in other areas of the market because REITs are relatively small, inefficiently priced companies. Excluding Evergreen Global Real Estate, look at the strikingly wide variations in returns of the five remaining funds in 1994. The performances ranged from a sizable 11.63% decline to a healthy 8.31% rise in a year when the NAREIT index returned 3.17%. Also observe the sizable variations in five-year annualized returns for the funds that had data available over the full 1990-1994 period. Again, excluding Evergreen Global Real Estate, you can see that the numbers range from 2.92% for United Services Real Estate to 11.76% for Fidelity Real Estate Investment. The latter outperformed both the NAREIT index and the general equity funds average over the five-year period.<p>

<br>
<H3>Real Estate Funds versus REITS </H3>


Individuals who want exposure to real estate could, of course, invest directly in an assortment of REITs. What are the pros and cons of funds versus individual REITs?<p>


Advantages of direct investment: The primary advantage of investing directly in REITs is that you can stay less diversified and focus in on a geographic area that you think is going to be expanding. Or you could place your bet on the property type you expect to do best.<p>


Another advantage is that you bypass the expenses of a mutual fund.<p>


Disadvantages of direct investment: The disadvantages outnumber the advantages by a wide margin. For starters, REITs are highly specialized and relatively complex. It's a lot harder for most investors to pick a handful of good REITs than it is to add a few blue-chip stocks to their portfolios. Just as the management of a real estate fund is very important, it is also crucial to evaluate the managements of the REITs themselves. It takes an experienced individual with good industry contacts to judge the capabilities of REIT managers. In general, fund managers have better access to information on REITs and they are able to get it more quickly than the average individual.<p>


Real estate funds also have an advantage in terms of investing in REIT IPOs. Fund managers get the first look at the choicest REIT IPOs, before individuals have a chance to buy. The reason for this is that funds buy their shares in considerably larger quantities.<p>


In addition, it's important to have broad exposure to different property types in different geographic areas, because equity REITs can be adversely affected by a deterioration in their property values. Since REITs tend to concentrate in specific areas of the country and specialize in different types of properties, you would probably need to hold several of them to get sufficient diversification.<p>


Besides offering broad diversification, REIT fund managers have the ability to shift their investment strategies among property types and geographic areas with changing economic conditions. In recent years, for example, the demand for apartments has exceeded the demand for offices. <p>


Investing in REITs involves risks similar to those associated with investing in small stocks. REITs may have limited financial resources and their shares are less liquid than those of larger companies. Small companies, including REITs, tend to be more volatile than the larger companies included in the S&P 500. For these reasons, the diversification and professional management offered by real estate funds makes sense for the average investor.<p>


Finally, no-load real estate funds can purchase REITS at institutional brokerage rates, giving them a transaction cost advantage over the direct purchase of REITs, which you buy through a broker like any other stock.<p>

<br>
<H3>Questions to Ponder </H3>


Here are six questions to ponder if you're shopping for a real estate fund.<p>

<ul>
<li> Is the fund primarily a domestic real estate portfolio or does it invest globally? Global funds have very different characteristics and their performances can deviate significantly from those of domestic funds.<p>


<li> What is the manager's track record? Since many real estate funds have not been in existence that long, it can be difficult to judge performance. The track record of the manager in the real estate securities area is particularly important if you're considering a new fund. We've seen that some real estate funds have performed poorly over the past five years, so the possibility of disappointing performance over extended periods certainly exists.<p>


<li> How large is the fund's family and what is its reputation? Large fund groups are going to have more clout when it comes to getting the choicest REITs through the underwriters as they go public.<p>


<li>How does the income ratio of the fund relate to those of its peers? Examine this number for each available year. If the value of this ratio is relatively low find out why. It could be that the fund has high expenses or that it doesn't invest that much in REITs.<p>


<li> What percentage of the fund's total portfolio is in REITs? Funds that invest in REITs are typically more income-oriented and are generally the best choices for those looking for a pure real estate play.<p>


<li> How widely diversified is the fund both geographically and by sector? Managers that make big sector bets can do very well if the bets turn out to be right but face the obvious risk of being wrong.<p>
</ul>
<br>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>


Owning a home and even a rental property or two is not the same as holding stakes in different property types and geographic markets. To add further diversification to your asset mix, consider allocating 5% to 10% of your portfolio to a diversified real estate mutual fund.<p>


Real estate mutual funds with relatively high income ratios and proven managements offer an excellent way to round out an IRA or other tax-sheltered retirement account. But don't allocate any more than a modest slice of your investment pie to this highly specialized sector.<p>

Differences Among Similar Sector Funds </H2><P>
<HR>

Sector mutual funds--those that concentrate in an industry or a few related industries--not surprisingly tend to mirror the performance of their sector. Industries covered range from defense and aerospace to leisure, with sectors focusing on regional banks and air transportation in between.<p>


But investing in these funds is not as easy as simply picking the right sector.<p>


Risk is an important consideration. Sector funds tend to concentrate their investments on fewer stocks within their industry than an average common stock mutual fund. The result? Sector funds can be extremely volatile, and while individual firm risk is reduced through diversification, industry risk is magnified.<p>


Beyond the challenge of deciding which sector to go into is deciding on which fund among all those that, at least by name, are in the same sector. The challenge is that not all funds in the same sector are similar.<p>


For one, portfolio managers sometimes have very different viewpoints of what constitutes a sector. For example, health-related sector funds may or may not include pharmaceutical companies, medical technology, or even biotechnology.<p>


In addition, many sector funds operating in what on the surface may appear to be a less diverse sector, such as utilities, still have a wide latitude of action in portfolio composition and structure. Stock/cash allocations, sector segment weights, top stock holdings, and number of securities are just as likely not to match as match within the same sector fund designation. <p>


Sector funds often populate both the tops and bottoms of performance lists. So how should you play them: Go with what is hot, be a contrarian and buy the bottom, or throw up your hands and buy them all?<p>


None of those strategies is likely to be consistently effective over the long term. One strategy that may prove useful is to shade your portfolio toward a sector that you have some knowledge of (through your work experience or education, for example) and that you feel has positive long-term prospects but that you do not feel qualified or have time to follow and pick enough individual stocks to diversify within the industry.<p>


Despite their differences, there are certain points to keep in mind when considering any investment in any sector fund:<p>

<ul>
<li> Sector funds can be very volatile.<p>


<li> While sector funds are usually diversified by company, reducing company risk, they are not diversified by industry, which adds to risk.<p>


 <li>Funds that are in the same sector, and even those with essentially the same name, can have portfolios that are vastly different and management strategies that are polar.<p>


<li> Funds within the same sector can produce dramatically different yield and total return numbers.<p>
</ul>

Before investing in a sector fund, get the prospectus and annual report of at least a few funds with five-year records in the same sector; be sure to compare industry weightings, top holdings, expense ratios, yield and total return for one, three, and five years.<p>


And remember, picking the fund is going to be a lot easier than picking the sector.<p>

<h2 align=center>Considerations for Investing in Sector Funds</h2>

Many investors look to sector funds to obtain concentrated exposure to a promising industry or theme. However, knowledge and caution must always be used due to the inherent volatility of such a concentration.<p>


You can learn a lot about the way sector funds behave by studying the ups and downs of different groups on a comparative basis. The table below contains the annual total returns of six different sector fund groups, as reported by Morningstar.<p>


The characteristics and risks of several popular sector fund groups are outlined below. Keep in mind that there can be substantial differences in terms of the portfolios within any one broad sector.<p>


<strong>Financial Services: </strong>These funds can hold the stocks of banks, savings and loans, finance companies, brokerages, leasing companies, insurance firms, and mutual fund companies. Distinctions between financial services firms are becoming increasingly blurred. Financial services companies are affected by economic conditions, interest rates, and government regulations.<p>


<strong>Healthcare: </strong>The portfolios of these funds include pharmaceuticals, designers and manufacturers of medical supplies and equipment, and hospitals and home healthcare agencies. Specific funds may invest in a limited portion of the industry, such as biotechnology. Companies in the medical industry must deal with government regulations, which could affect them adversely. Their products or services may be subject to rapid obsolescence. Many biotech companies are now involved in developing exciting new drugs, but predicting which promising cure for a life-threatening disease will gain FDA approval is next to impossible. The Clinton administration's focus on healthcare reform has resulted in a cloud of uncertainty that has hurt healthcare stocks. Nevertheless, the graying of America should lead to continued strong demand for healthcare.<p>


<strong>Natural Resources: </strong>The natural resource funds concentrate on companies involved in oil and natural gas, precious and non-precious metals, minerals, and paper and forest products. Natural resource funds tend to perform best in inflationary times when oil prices advance sharply. Some funds in this group are pure-energy portfolios; they confine their holdings to companies in the oil and gas industries as well as newer energy sources such as nuclear and solar power.<p>


<strong>Precious Metals: </strong>These funds focus primarily on the stocks of gold-mining companies. Some invest only in South African stocks, while others totally avoid them for political reasons and still others own shares of firms based in all major gold-producing countries. Buying gold stocks directly and, especially, via mutual funds is the simplest way to participate in an anticipated price rise in the metal. Since speculators move in and out of funds and stocks as their enthusiasm waxes and wanes, they both tend to exhibit far more volatility than the metal itself. Further exaggerating the moves of mining companies is their earnings leverage. Since the costs of mining are often largely fixed, the majority of each $1 rise in the price of the metal goes to the firm's bottom line.<p>


Gold sometimes moves inversely to the prices of stocks and bonds, and occasionally performs very well during highly inflationary, tumultuous times. But the price of the metal is very unpredictable. Further, a well-diversified stock portfolio will far outperform an assortment of gold mining companies on a risk-adjusted basis over the long run.<p>


<strong>Real Estate: </strong>These funds invest in publicly traded companies in the real estate area, primarily REITs (real estate investment trusts). But they do not invest directly in land and buildings. The real estate funds are much more income-oriented than the typical sector fund, although they can be volatile as the sector has its ups and downs.<p>


<strong>Technology: </strong>These portfolios focus on companies that research and develop new products, processes or technologies in fields such as agriculture, computers, communications, and medical technology. These could be small growth firms. Successful technology companies should grow faster than the overall economy.<p>


<strong>Telecommunications: </strong>Telecommunications funds target companies providing telephone, cellular and cable service, as well as communications equipment. The huge global telecommunications industry encompasses foreign and U.S. companies engaged in these and other activities. Foreign telephone companies are excellent vehicles for tapping emerging stock markets in view of the trend toward privat-ization of state-owned telephone monopolies in countries that don't have adequate phone service. The technology is advancing and there is potential for substantial long-term growth in both developed and developing economies. Telephone companies generally pay above-average dividends, although fund managers often focus on those with capital appreciation potential. The global telecommunications funds are more diversified than the typical sector fund, due to the wide variety of companies in this industry.<p>


<strong>Utility: </strong>Far and away the largest segment of the sector fund universe, utility funds are characteristically more stable than the typical sector portfolio; many utility stocks fluctuate only about half as much as the overall market. The industry consists mainly of electric, natural gas, and telephone companies. The funds mix the groups in various ways or specialize in one of them. Even though utility funds are ordinarily stable, they can be volatile at times. Like bonds, they are interest-rate sensitive. Increasing rates depress high-yielding stocks as well as long-term bonds; declining rates lead to robust total returns.<p>


The following are some guidelines to keep in mind when investing in sector funds:<p>

<ul>
<li>Check the portfolio. Make sure the fund invests in the kinds of companies you want. Major differences can exist among funds investing in the same sector.<p>


<li> Be sure to evaluate the beta and, especially, the standard deviation of your fund.<p>


<li> Limit any investments in volatile sectors to a small amount of your total equity fund holdings, based on your risk tolerance.<p>


<li> Many people are attracted to hot sectors because of their excellent recent performance. Beware of this tendency, and don't buy in too late!<p>


<li> Excessive price-earnings ratios spell substantial risk. If a sector becomes pricey following a period of brilliant performance, an unpleasant surprise could cause its stocks to head south.<p>


<li> Watch those expenses. Some sector portfolios have expense ratios that are well above 2%.<p>


<li> Check the income ratio if you're income-oriented. A time of generally high income ratios for funds investing in a sector such as utilities may signal good value.<p>


<li> Avoid active switching. It often leads to poor long-run results since losses can overcome gains. Also, transaction costs add up if they are imposed.<p>


<li> Don't buy a sector fund and forget about it. Sector funds that have narrower, more volatile portfolios must be watched closely. It is also important to keep up with industry developments.<p>

How Small-Stock Funds Can Fit Into Your Investment Portfolio </H2><P>
<HR>

It pays to think small if you're working with a long-term investment horizon. Since 1926, the stocks of smaller firms have averaged about two percentage points more in compound annual total return than large firms.<p>


How small is "small"?<p>


Although the cutoff point for small stocks is really not hard and fast, "small" companies range from under $10 million in market capitalization for obscure, embryonic firms to about $600 million.<p>


For individuals who want to invest a portion of their equity holdings in small firm stocks, mutual funds are ideal, since diversification is particularly important: Small firms often have a difficult time obtaining capital, have erratic growth, may be run by inexperienced people, are threatened by devastating competition from larger companies, and their shares can be highly illiquid and volatile.<p>


Small-stock mutual funds generally focus on Nasdaq and stock exchange-listed firms whose market caps place them in the bottom fifth of the New York Stock Exchange. But many fund managers mix in at least a few mid caps and possibly even some big caps in their portfolios. Some managers who do not ordinarily initiate new positions in larger companies may hold on to good performers that grow to market values of $10 billion or more. Others may follow a policy of selling stocks that outgrow their definition of "small."<p>


Small-cap funds can be categorized in various ways. The simplest way is to begin in terms of the investment strategy: For instance, is it growth-oriented or value-oriented? A fund's composite portfolio price-earnings ratio tells a lot about where it falls within the range from the extremes of pure growth to pure value.<p>

<strong>Growth And Aggressive Growth:</strong>Most small-cap portfolios have a growth orientation. Their managers seek companies whose earnings are expected to ratchet upward at a high rate. These stocks generally have above-average price-earnings ratios, and therefore possess above-average risk when the small-cap market gets overheated. Small-cap growth funds differ in terms of their aggressiveness and the size range of firms targeted. A number of funds labeled as "aggressive growth" also target small caps. Aggressive growth managers may, for example, place big bets on sectors such as technology and healthcare in their quest for maximum capital gains.<p>


<strong>Value:</strong> An increasing number of funds have a value orientation. They look for firms that are cheap in terms of their price-earnings ratios and other valuation yardsticks. These portfolios can also benefit from the "low price-earnings ratio effect," another stock market anomaly. Academics have found that diversified portfolios of low price-earnings ratio stocks tend to outperform average or high price-earnings ratio portfolios. In an efficient market you should not expect any differences in the risk-adjusted performances of high and low price-earnings ratio portfolios.<p>


<strong>Equity Income:</strong> A special breed of small-cap value funds is the small company equity-income portfolio. In addition to their primary objective of capital appreciation, these funds search for higher yields. Besides holding the common stocks of small companies, these portfolios may contain lesser investments in preferred stocks, convertible bonds or stocks of bigger companies to prop up their yields. The tilt toward yield should make these funds less volatile than the typical small-capitalization fund.<p>


<strong>Blended: </strong>Growth and value investing are by no means mutually exclusive. Some small-cap funds blend the styles. They represent a kind of compromise for those who are not sure whether to buy a growth or value fund.<p>


<strong>Index: </strong>Several small-cap index funds are also available. Some argue that an index portfolio doesn't make as much sense for small stocks since astute managers should be able to locate and profit from potential inefficiencies in small, under-followed companies. However, because transaction costs are relatively high for small stocks, too rapid a turnover can zap any excess returns the manager is able to garner. In addition, in the relatively inefficient small-cap market, some portfolios are bound to significantly underperform their peers and the Russell 2000; investing in an index fund ensures that you are not part of that underperformance. <p>


As well as examining the customary data, such as past performance, volatility of returns, expenses, turnover, and management tenure, prospective small-cap investors should consider how big a small-cap fund is and the size of the companies in which it invests.<p>


Why is portfolio size important? Mutual funds with assets of $200 million or less have an easier time investing in truly small stocks, which tend to be illiquid. It's hard for a large mutual fund to buy or sell a meaningful amount of a small firm's stock without affecting its price. Small portfolios are easier to maneuver and their holdings can be limited to several dozen of the manager's favorites. Large funds may end up holding hundreds of stocks and be burdened with superfluous diversification.<p>


Of course, there's more to any fund than its size. Some stock funds that remain very small (with assets below, say, $10 million) are lemons. They perform poorly, have high expenses and, consequently, never attract assets. Funds with poor track records have a tendency to continue their poor performance and turn investors off.<p>


The average market capitalization of the firms a fund holds is also important. You can get a broad feel for this by examining the prospectus or contacting the fund. When examining a listing of the fund's holdings, the fewer names you recognize, the smaller the stocks. But it's best to use a more precise indicator, such as a median market capitalization figure.<p>


Currently, the average median market capitalization for small-stock funds is $584 million, according to Morningstar Mutual Funds. Only a small number of funds have median market caps below $100 million.<p>


At the other end of the range, those with median market caps above $1 billion typically have substantial representations of mid-size and large companies in their portfolios. Incidentally, a few funds with words like "emerging growth" in their names have relatively high median market caps. Fund names and labels can be misleading. Of course, there's nothing necessarily wrong with a fund that targets small, medium, and large companies if you're looking for that mix.<p>


Here are some points to keep in mind when investing in small-stock funds.<p>

<ul>
<li>Check to see whether the manager focuses on growth, value or both. If you want to have two small-stock funds, it's wise to have one of each. The two styles tend to be in vogue at different times.<p>


<li>Examine the portfolio's sector weightings. Small-stock funds that place big bets on a few high-growth sectors are going to have more volatility.<p>


<li>Find out the fund's total assets. With upward of $250 million to $300 million in assets it becomes increasingly more difficult for a fund to function as a true small-cap portfolio.<p>


<li>Try to determine what the fund considers "small." Funds that target the smallest firms will have median market capitalization below $200 million.<p>


<li>Check the expense ratio and portfolio turnover. Funds with very low total assets can have expense ratios of 2% or more. In addition, too high a turnover can eat into your returns since transaction costs are greater for small stocks.<p>


<li>Who is the manager? The manager's skills are very important when it comes to small-cap funds. See how long the manager has been with the fund.<p>


<li>A good index fund can be a wise choice for small-stock investors. You avoid the risk of investing in a fund that significantly under-performs its benchmark.<p>


<li>In gauging performance of small-stock funds compare them with the appropriate peers and indexes. For example, a value fund should be compared with other value funds. The best index to use is the Russell 2000. Its past annual returns can be found in AAII's Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Mutual Funds. Daily values appear in The Wall Street Journal.<p>


<li>Dollar cost averaging is a sensible strategy to use with small-stock funds because of their greater volatility. Putting a modest sum away monthly makes a great deal of sense. You get more shares with your fixed sum of money when prices are down, and you need not worry about timing.<p>

Mutual Funds: Sifting Through the Data Overload </H2><P>
<HR>

In today's Information Age, there is no shortage of mutual fund information. Indeed, when confronted with massive amounts of mutual fund data, many individuals feel threatened with information overload.<P>


But too much is better than too little, and the way to handle it is through a systematic approach that identifies important pieces of information and then assesses that information.<P>


Many investors start with the performance history of the fund. When examining historical performance, keep these important points in mind:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Three-, five-, and 10-year compound average annual returns provide a quick summary of performance. However, one high-return year may mask a couple of subpar or even loss years. Solution? Look at year-by-year returns, noting any extreme performance years and remembering generally the market conditions that prevailed during those years.<P>


<LI>What is the ideal time period to examine? One year is clearly too short, yet in some cases 10-year figures may be misleading if the character of the fund has greatly changed. At a minimum, look at three-year figures and spend some time with the five-year figure. Funds with less than three full years of data are a blind bet unless the portfolio manager has prior fund management experience that you can evaluate.<P>


<LI>Bull market and bear market performance numbers are most useful when examined as a team. When compared to each other they add to an intuitive feel for performance and risk. It is an unusual fund that leads in a bull market and avoids a bear market. Usually, a fund does well in one but not the other.<P>


<LI>While examining all these return figures is informative, ultimately you need a standard or benchmark to judge performance. One method is to compare the fund to others in its category (AAII uses a difference from fund category statistic). Any fund that performs above its peers year-after-year with only an occasional lapse should be prized for its consistency.<P>


<LI>It is all too easy to muse about return and ignore risk. There are several risk figures that should be examined: the risk of the fund compared to all other funds, the risk of the fund compared to other funds in its category, how much the fund's return has fluctuated over time (standard deviation), and the sensitivity of the fund to changes in the stock market (beta).<P>


Beta is not always an appropriate risk measure since not all risk is related to the stock market. That's why it is important to also examine a total return risk measure, such as standard deviation. Remember, risk is the factor to check if you find a fund with outstanding performance. Make sure it doesn't have extraordinary risk compared to its peers. <P>
</UL>

Investors should also examine per share data figures for prospective funds. When examining per share data for a fund, don't forget to consider these important points:<P>

<UL>
<LI>If you are interested in income from the fund, look for year-to-year consistency in dividends and net income.<P>


<LI>Because of their investment management strategy and style, some funds make frequent and large distributions. Since these distributions are stated in dollar terms, how can you assess what is large? Compare the distributions to net asset value each year, and if it seems large to you, then it probably is.<P>


<LI>While net asset value reflects changing markets, it is also reduced when distributions of income, dividends and capital gains are made; a decline therefore doesn't necessarily mean the fund has done badly. Don't spend much time with net asset value; instead, look at performance figures.<P>


<LI>High expenses are hard to overcome and will drag down performance. Stay away from high expense funds. What is high? Compare your fund to the average for its category.<P>


<LI>Net income to assets is a yield figure, but not total return. It is useful to compare a fund's yield to the yield averages for various categories of mutual funds. If your fund's yield is much different from the average for its category, it may mean that it is pursuing an extreme strategy.<P>


<LI>High portfolio turnover usually translates into more transaction costs incurred by the fund, which may lower performance if not offset sufficiently by trading gains; it also may translate into more capital gains distributions and thus a potential tax liability.<P>


<LI>Total assets may be a concern for certain funds. Small-cap stock funds with large asset bases may have trouble operating effectively in thinly traded stocks. On the other hand, a small asset base means that fixed expenses can't be spread around a very large shareholder base, resulting in higher expense ratios.<P>
</UL>

Other fund information is not as crucial to an evaluation, but can reveal much about a fund and how it will behave:<P>

<UL>
<LI>When looking at performance records for actively managed funds, it is useful to note whether the current portfolio manager was the manager guiding the fund during the years of outstanding performance. While a new portfolio manager is not a reason to avoid or sell a fund, it can be a tie-breaker between two funds with a similar performance record.<P>


<LI>Investment categories are a rough guide to the fund's behavior. Any classification, however, is a judgment call. Information on the fund's goals and specific areas of investing will give a view as to what the fund is trying to accomplish and how they intend to do it. Also, looking at the percentage the fund holds in stock, bonds, and cash and its largest individual holdings will reveal what the fund is actually doing compared to its stated goals.<P>


<LI>Note any loads (commissions to sales personnel), redemption fees, the 12b-1 annual load charge and any other charges. Loads and fees diminish performance dollar for dollar. Make sure the services you receive justify the charges.<P>
</UL>

Is this all you need to know to select a fund? No. It is, however, a useful summary of important points and should be used in conjunction with a thorough reading of the prospectus and a review of the annual report that lists all securities held by the fund.<P>

How Well Should Your Mutual Fund Have Performed </H2><P>
<HR>

Any measurement is useless if the scale is inaccurate. For individual investors, that means carefully selecting the scale used to weigh a mutual fund portfolio manager. To be meaningful, the scale must relate the portfolio's performance to the risk that was undertaken to achieve the return.<p>


Investors often misevaluate professional money managers by focusing solely on return. Sometimes, the entire analysis comes down to:<p>

<UL>
<LI> A loss is bad;
<LI> A positive return is good 
<LI> A double-digit return is terrific;
<LI> Risk is unimportant as long as the return is high 
</UL>


However, risk should be given an equal weight with return when judging manager performance. Over time, every investment carries a certain amount of risk for which investors should demand proportionate compensation.<p>


Since higher risk should mean higher return, the greater the risk undertaken by the portfolio, the higher its return should be--a simple summary of a complex formulation. In addition, your fund's performance should be judged relative to funds with a similar investment objective, which implicitly considers risk.<p>


One evaluation method, taking these risk factors into consideration, is to determine what your fund should have returned based on these three approaches to measuring risk--market risk, total risk and investment objective risk. The calculation is presented in the table below, using an aggressive growth fund as an example.<p>


In these calculations, beta is used as a measure of market risk; it measures how a portfolio's return has behaved relative to the overall market. A beta of 1.00 indicates a portfolio behaves similarly to the market--when the market rises or drops 10%, the portfolio on average rises or drops 10%; a beta of 1.5 indicates more market risk--when the market rises or drops 10%, the portfolio on average rises or drops 15%. <p>


Total risk and investment objective risk are measured using standard deviation, which looks at the total variability of returns over time. The standard deviations of low-load mutual funds are reported in AAII's Quarterly Low-Load Mutual Fund Update newsletter.<p>


The evaluations using all three risk measures compare the risk of the fund against a benchmark. A fund's beta is implicitly a relative ratio, the same as dividing it by the market beta of 1.00. Dividing the fund's standard deviation by the market's standard deviation produces a total risk ratio, which compares the fund's volatility with the market's volatility; dividing the fund's standard deviation by the average standard deviation for its investment objective produces the investment objective risk ratio, which compares the fund's volatility with the volatility for the average fund in its investment objective category.<p>


Once these relative ratios are determined, the equations for evaluating risk and return are the same. The required return states the return the fund should have produced based on its risk; this return is then compared to the fund's actual return, to see how much better--or worse--the fund did than would be expected.<p>


What do the results mean? It depends on the risk measure used. Theoretically, for well-diversified portfolios, the use of these three measures of risk should provide you with similar results. However, in real world situations--no single approach for evaluating the risk and return of a fund may work in all cases.<p>


In our example, the fund did well considering market risk (beta), the amount of total risk it incurred and its risk relative to the average for its investment objective.<p>


While the fund did well using all three risk measures, it is important to look behind the statistics. The annual report of the sample aggressive growth fund, which details actual holdings and industry breakdowns, shows some concentration in health care/medical and technology, two volatile industries that may not track the market. These concentrations may make the benchmark comparison--and thus beta--less meaningful. For this fund, total risk and risk relative to its investment objective may be more useful risk measures.<p>


AAII's "The Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Mutual Funds," lists beta for common stock funds and a total risk ranking based on five breakdowns--high, above average, average, below average, and low. This latter measure ranks the standard deviation of return for all funds in the Guide.<p>


While you may not make any of these calculations, you should develop an intuitive understanding of risk in order to judge performance. Looking at portfolio composition with respect to the cash/stock mix, the industry representation, and the type of stocks (small versus large) will point you in the direction of an appropriate benchmark and a judgment as to relative risk.<p>


Comparing fund performance to investment objective averages while judging differences in risk from the average risk for the fund objective is probably the easiest method with the most information available. The key is not high or low absolute returns, but how a fund or investment portfolio performed relative to the risks undertaken. <p>


Higher returns, on average, are only achieved with higher risks, a simple idea all too often forgotten.<p>

The Differences Among Mutual Fund Rankings </H2><P>
<HR>

Determining a mutual fund's return is not a complicated mathematical task. What, then, accounts for differences among returns from the various mutual fund rankings services? There are a number of factors. They include:<p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The time period covered: </strong>While the time period covered may seem a simple determination--after all, a year is a year--many mutual fund ranking sources do not match up because of different publication schedules.<p>


The calendar year--January 1 through December 31--is the most common unit of time, and multiples and fractions of the calendar year are often reported. Performance as of June 30 is also a time period used by publications going to press in late summer and early fall with a special mutual fund issue.<p>


What happens when performance covering a calendar year is compared to performance as of June 30? The performance difference between these two time periods is not just six months; in fact, there are two six-month periods that are different. A mutual fund could have drastically different performance figures over a five-year period if one figure encompasses a crash or rally that the other figure doesn't include. When you encounter different reported results on a fund you are following, look first at the precise time period covered.<p>


Another time period problem arises when ranking services provide returns for up market (bull) and down market (bear) performance periods. First, there is no precise definition of a bull or bear market. Second, some reporting services use multiple up and down market periods; and third, not all funds were in operation during all the up and down market periods. Since there is little consensus but much emphasis on this type of evaluation, for risk as well as return, ranking differences are commonplace.<p>


<li><strong>What the return includes: </strong>Returns are composed of capital gains plus income, and reflect the expenses of running the fund, along with the brokerage costs incurred in buying and selling the securities in the fund portfolio. Fund expenses include investment adviser fees and the administrative costs of the fund. If a fund has an investor-paid 12b-1 charge, which is an annual load levied on fund assets, this is also included in the return figure. Front-end loads, back-end loads and redemption fees are usually not included in the reported return  figures.<p>


However, some publications--Money magazine, for example--include full front-end loads in at least some of their performance statistics. Money reports what $10,000 would have grown to over five years, with any front-end sales charges included. The dilemma is that if front-end loads are included in all returns, short-term performance figures would be severely distorted, obscuring the performance of the fund and the portfolio manager. But loads do directly reduce the return to investors no matter what the time period.<p>


<li><strong>Reinvestment of fund distributions: </strong>Almost all reported returns include the reinvestment of any distributions made by the fund during the period. But when the distributions are reinvested does differ among reporting services, and this may make a significant difference in reported performance. Forbes, for example, reinvests distributions at the end of the month in which the fund makes its distribution (goes ex-distribution). Almost all funds reinvest, however, at the ex-distribution price on the ex-distribution day, which may not be the end of the month. If the fund price at which distributions are reinvested for mutual fund shareholders is not the same price as the month-end price, then reported returns can vary substantially, particularly when markets move sharply and abruptly.<p>


<li><strong>How the return performance is reported:</strong>There are three common reporting techniques for returns that you are most likely to encounter: dollar returns, annualized returns, and unannualized returns. While they are all correct, they will appear to be radically different. Table 3 is a sample of sources of mutual fund return data--all but one published in January and February of 1993--to illustrate a cross section of return reporting techniques, and one source reporting in September of 1992 to illustrate the impact of a difference of six months in the data. The Acorn Fund is used in the example simply because it is near the top of most alphabetical listings. Acorn is a no-load fund that is currently closed to new investors.<p>


The performance reported by Barron's is in the form of dollar changes in value and is reported on a calendar-year basis. While these dollar returns are correct, they are difficult to evaluate: Few investors can look at a dollar return, particularly over a long period, and make an informed judgment. The standard in reporting performance, and for good reason, is a percentage return.<p>


The performance figures for Money magazine differ significantly. One reason is that the data is as of December 24, 1992, and not year-end, presumably to meet publication deadlines. As you can see, the one-year return figure is most affected and the three-year and five-year returns less so. The five-year annualized return is reported at 18.4%, which makes the $19,775 figure (the value of $10,000 invested five years ago) puzzling, since compounding $10,000 at 18.4% a year should be $23,268. Money does reduce the figure by any front-end loads, but since Acorn does not have a load, no adjustment should have been made.<p>


U.S. News & World Report gives unannualized performance figures for one, three and five years, and also a dollar performance figure for five years, but with an initial investment base of $1,000. The one-year performance of 24.5% differs from the return of 24.2% reported by all the sources using year-end data; it is too large for a rounding difference but may be attributable to when distributions are assumed to be reinvested. When annualized, the 135.7% five-year return converts to 18.7% annually, a figure inconsequentially different from the other sources over the same time period. <p>


Just as dollar performance figures are harder to judge than percentage returns, unannualized multiyear returns are harder for investors to evaluate than annualized returns.<p>


When you notice discrepancies in the returns of various reporting services, check for the following factors:<p>

<ul>
<li>Be certain of the time period and only compare performance of mutual funds over identical periods.<p>


<li>Determine what loads are incorporated into the performance figures.<p>


<li>Find out when distributions are reinvested.<p>


<li>Be able to translate and understand dollar performance figures and unannualized returns if you intend to rely on them.<p>
</ul>

Examining Mutual Fund Winners </H2><P>
<HR>

Everyone loves a winner, especially if you are invested in one. How does a mutual fund become a "winner"--one that beats its peers relatively consistently?<p>


A recent analysis of the characteristics of funds that were in the top 25% of their investment objective for each of the last year, three years, and five years turned up some noteworthy results.<p>


In examining the characteristics of these funds, one item in particular appeared to help these winners do well beating their peers over recent and extended periods. For the most part, it was good management, many times coupled with risk that is well above average for the objective category--not just in terms of greater volatility of return, but often in terms of special risks.<p>


What are the implications for investors who are examining funds with above-average performance? No fund can be above-average without being unusual--it is difficult to best the competition unless you don't quite act like everyone else. It takes more than a talented portfolio manager--it takes aggressive investing, no matter what the category, or it takes an unusual approach that simply works.<p>


Therefore, when you are examining mutual fund performance figures as part of your search, it is important to understand how a fund achieved its above-average performance before making any final decision.<p>


Check into the character of the fund investments--for instance, if it is a sector fund or emphasizes small capitalization stocks, and if it invests overseas. Flexibility in seeking domestic or foreign investment has value, but it also makes funds more difficult to understand and to integrate into an individual investor's overall portfolio without redundancies in the international portion of the portfolio.<p>


What other mutual fund characteristics are worth noting?<p>


One is the expense ratio. While the expense ratio is already reflected in the total return figures, an extremely high or low expense ratio compared to the category is worth noting. Expense ratios will usually have a relatively small impact on performance in the aggressive growth category, but they may be significant in other lower return, more homogeneous areas, such as the bond categories.<p>


Another characteristic worth noting is the portfolio turnover. Portfolio turnover is a measure of how actively the fund manager transacts the portfolio's securities. A typical aggressive growth portfolio has over 100% of its assets, by value, traded during the year. Higher portfolio turnovers translate to increased transaction costs and lower returns. Transaction costs are not included in the expense ratio.<p>


Because of the low transaction costs in the bond area and the emphasis on income, very high portfolio turnovers are not unusual and hold less serious cost implications than those of stock funds.<p>


A high performing but high tax exposure fund could be sheltered if it is held in a tax-deferred retirement account. Two tax statistics that prove revealing are the average income and capital gains distributions that a fund makes.<p>


Given the emphasis on growth in the aggressive growth category, income distributions are virtually nonexistent in funds with above-average performance. Capital gains distributions, on the other hand, are usually real and large. In the bond categories, particularly the corporate high-yield bond category, this experience is reversed, with high income distribution and low capital gains.<p>


A related tax statistic is the percentage of the portfolio that represents unrealized capital gains. While it is unlikely that these unrealized gains would all be realized in the short term, the higher the percentage, the higher the risk of large distributions. Portfolio managers change on occasion, and investment styles and strategies may be reformulated, with resulting shifts in portfolio assets.<p>


The total assets of a mutual fund can be significant for two reasons. First, a larger asset base usually translates into lower expenses. Second, for funds such as those in the aggressive growth category that have a small-capitalization stock bias, size may be a hindrance. Moving large blocks of money around in the small-cap area is difficult and reduces flexibility. The total assets of the top-performing funds in the aggressive growth category are all well below the category average.<p>


The number of different securities held gives some indication of whether or not a fund is broadly diversified. Sector funds usually invest in less than 100 securities. Given that they are concentrated by industry, the number of securities that would meet their investment objective is limited. A fund, usually a sector fund, can be classified as non-diversified, which allows 50% of the portfolio assets to be concentrated in the securities of one issuer.<p>


Funds with 250 or more securities are generally well-diversified and usually have high total assets. The U.S. government bond market is large and liquid, and therefore large government bond funds do not suffer from these kinds of problems; the size of a bond fund can be a problem, though, if it is so small it is saddled with a high expense ratio.<p>


Finally, special risks are always worth noting, but difficult to weigh. A reading of the prospectus and the statement of additional information (available from the fund upon request) will mention these special risks, but may not be as informative as you would like. The ability to borrow, use derivatives to speculate rather than hedge portfolio risks, invest in illiquid securities or invest in lower-quality debt (junk bonds) adds to potential risk. But remember, derivatives, options and futures, for example, can be used to increase or reduce risk. A fund's ability to use derivatives is not the issue; how those derivatives can be used is.<p>

Closed-End Fund Rights Offerings and What They Mean for Shareholders  </H2><P>
<HR>

Most investors are familiar with open-end mutual funds, whose shares are continuously issued and whose shareholders can sell shares back to the fund at net asset value, the per share market value of the securities the fund holds.<P>


Closed-end fund shares, on the other hand, are not continuously issued, and shareholders cannot sell their shares back to the fund at net asset value. Instead, after a fund goes public, closed-end fund shares are traded in the secondary markets in the same way that shares in corporations are traded.<P>


Recently, rights offerings have been used by quite a few managers to issue new shares and increase the pool of money they can use for investing. Rights are given to current record date shareholders, allowing them to buy a given number of shares at a specified price and maintain their proportional ownership in the issuing company.<P>


For example, a closed-end fund may want to raise capital by increasing the number of shares outstanding by 50%. It could do so by issuing rights to current shareholders as of the record date; these shareholders can exercise these rights and purchase, for instance, 50 shares of stock from the company for each 100 shares they own.<P>


These rights allow the purchase of shares at a price (the subscription price) that is announced by the fund near the exercise date, and which is usually at a discount from the current market price. The rights are short-term and can be exercised at any time before the expiration date. The rights can be exercised by shareholders of record as of the record date, after which the shares go ex-rights (that is, shares purchased after this date have no rights attached to them).<P>


Because rights allow the purchase of shares at a discount to market, they have value and are often traded in the market during the subscription period. However, in some cases the rights are non-transferable and only the shareholder can exercise them. If a shareholder sells his rights or chooses not to exercise the rights, his proportional ownership in the fund declines, since there will be more outstanding shares than before, yet his own position is unchanged.<P>


Why would a closed-end fund's management want to initiate a rights offering? A few of the reasons might be:<P>

<UL>
<LI>The increase in assets under management potentially results in economies of scale that lower the firm's expense ratio. 


<LI>New attractive investment opportunities can be pursued without having to liquidate current holdings that have good prospects.


<LI>They efficiently allow the targeting of existing shareholders for the distribution of shares.
</UL>

From a shareholder's view, investors purchasing shares before a stock goes ex-rights receive rights allowing them to purchase additional stock before the rights' expiration date at an attractive price.<P>


There is really no difference in value between selling the rights or exercising them. The difference lies in the investor's ending investment position in the fund: If he exercises the shares, he must put up more capital, so he has more of his own assets invested in the fund, and his proportional interest in the fund is maintained; if he sells the rights, his proportional interest in the fund declines, his own commitment declines (due to the decline in net asset value), but he receives cash for the rights. The table at the end of this article illustrates these two situations and compares their results.<P>


Tax law provides that shareholders do not recognize taxable income on the distribution of rights. However, what the shareholder does with these rights can have income tax consequences.<P>


While an investor who exercises rights recognizes no income tax gain or loss, the investor who sells rights recognizes a capital gain or loss on the difference between sales proceeds and basis. This is long-term capital gain or loss if the rights have been held for more than a year at the time of the sale (a short-term gain otherwise). On the other hand, an investor who allows rights to expire recognizes a short-term capital loss equal to the basis of the rights.<P>


This basis of distributed rights is generally zero. However, tax law requires allocation of a portion of the basis of initially held fund shares to the rights when either:<P>

<UL>
<LI>The rights' fair market value on the distribution date equals at least 15% of the fair market value of the fund shares entitling the shareholder to right distribution, or


<LI>The shareholder elects to allocate basis between the two in the year of distribution.
</UL>

In this case, the holding period of initially held shares attaches to rights obtained by the shareholder. Purchased rights, on the other hand, have a basis equal to cost and a holding period that commences on the rights' purchase date. Alternatively, an investor who exercises his rights recognizes no gain or loss. New shares acquired have a basis equal to the sum of the shareholder's basis in the exercised right and any subscription price and a holding period that begins on the exercise date.<P>


Faced with a closed-end fund rights offering, investors owning shares in the fund that are held in street name at a brokerage house can simply instruct the broker to exercise the rights and complete the required paperwork. Usually, no commission is charged and the account is debited in the same manner as a regular purchase. However, an investor holding the certificates must complete the necessary subscription forms and send share payments to the subscription agent.<P>


Sometimes, shareholders don't exercise all of their rights. In this case, an over-subscription privilege allows the associated shares to be offered to shareholders who have exercised all rights initially issued to them. Exercising shareholders wishing to acquire additional shares may indicate the number of desired additional shares on the subscription certificate. All over-subscriptions are fully honored if sufficient shares exist. If sufficient shares are not available, the excess shares are prorated to over-subscribers as follows: <P>

<PRE>
           Holder's Position                Remaining
---------------------------------------  x  Excess
Total Position for All Over-Subscribers     Shares

</PRE>

Closed-end fund rights offerings offer new and unique opportunities to both management and shareholders in closed-end funds. From an economic standpoint, there is no difference between selling the rights or exercising them--the value to the investor is equivalent; the decision boils down to one of preference, and whether the investor wants to commit more cash to the investment. <P>


The only wrong decision would be to ignore the offering, neither selling the rights nor exercising them.<P>

The Subtleties of Closed-End Fund Rights Offerings </H2><P>
<HR>

Since mid-1991 there have been an unprecedented number of rights offerings by closed-end funds. Three took place in 1991, 18 in 1992, 33 in 1993, and 20 were completed  by mid-1994. Diversified domestic equity, sector, single country, taxable bond, and municipal bond funds have all had rights offerings.<P>


The proliferation of closed-end fund rights offerings has prompted numerous questions from shareholders and responses from financial writers. Do shareholders really benefit or is it mainly the management who profits (since management fees are paid as a percentage of assets)? The answer depends on the timing and other details of the individual offering and whether or not the shareholder takes action.<P>


Unlike mutual funds, closed-end funds do not have a continuous cash inflow from new share issuances. This can be frustrating to a successful manager who would like an infusion of additional money into the portfolio. There are two ways closed-end funds can raise additional money; a rights offering and a secondary public offering. The former is far more common than the latter. Rights are used to raise more money from existing shareholders at what management feels is an appropriate time, commonly--but not always--during a bull market.<P>


The basics of closed-end fund rights offerings were covered in "Closed-End Fund Rights Offerings: What They Mean for Shareholders" by Seth C. Anderson and Pat Eason (AAII Journal, June 1994). However, the complexity of the subject warrants a closer look at the subtleties of these offerings. In addition, the class-action suit filed in early 1994 by a Nuveen Premium Income Municipal Fund shareholder against the fund claiming that its rights offering was dilutive, demands that we examine the meaning of the word "dilution," as well as the different ways in which a rights offering can be structured.<P>


Let's begin with a brief review of the fundamentals.<P>


<H3>How Rights Offerings Work</H3>


Shareholders are usually issued one right for each share held--for instance, a shareholder with 100 shares would receive 100 rights. The rights can be used to purchase additional shares at a predetermined subscription price, commonly 5% to 10% below the fund's market price (or average price) as of a particular date. A right is a short-term option. Most closed-end rights offerings allow shareholders to exercise their option within several weeks. When the rights expire, they are worthless.<P>


Normally, several rights--typically three or more--are needed to acquire each new share. The subscription ratio depends on how many shares are now outstanding as well as the number to be issued. Here's a simple example. If Fund A has 9 million shares and wants to issue an additional 9 million shares (a 100% increase), the subscription ratio would be 1:1. Usually the subscription ratio is higher than 1:1, however. In a more typical case, if Fund A wanted to issue 3 million shares, three rights (9 million  3 million) would be required to buy each new share.<P>


It's important to recognize that the higher the subscription ratio, the smaller the percentage increase in shares outstanding. A 5:1 subscription ratio would result in a 20% increase in shares whereas a 20:1 ratio would increase shares by only 5%.<P>


The value of a right "rights on," when the rights and stock sell together as a package (i.e., prior to the stock going "ex-rights"), can be calculated with the formula appearing in Table 1. When the stock goes ex-rights its price falls by the value of one right and the denominator in the formula becomes "N" (rather than "N + 1"), as illustrated in Table 1.<P>



<HR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Table 1. Valuing a Right</STRONG>
<PRE>
<STRONG>Formula</STRONG>


                M - S
R (rights on) = -----
                N + 1


   where:

   R = theoretical value of one right

   M = market price of fund

   S = subscription price

   N = subscription ratio



<STRONG>Example</STRONG>


M = $10.00, S = $9.00, and N = 3


Value of a right "rights on":


                ($10.00 - $9.00)
R (rights on) = ----------------
                     (3 + 1)

              = $0.25


Ex-rights market price:


Ex-rights price = ($10.00 - $0.25)
                = $9.75


Value of a right "ex-rights":


                ($9.75 - $9.00)
R (ex-rights) = ---------------
                       3

              = $0.25

</PRE>
<HR>
<BR>

<H3>Shareholder Dilution</H3>


Rights offerings dilute the positions of shareholders who don't participate when the fund trades at a discount. The size of the pie (total assets) grows but its slices (net asset value per share) shrink because there are more shares. It's important to recognize that the dilution affects only those shareholders who don't exercise their rights or sell them (if they are transferable).<P>


Here's an example. The hypothetical Discount Fund has 10 million shares and wants to add two million more. The fund trades at $8.50, 15% below its $10.00 net asset value. The subscription price is set at $8.00, almost 6% below the market price. If the offering is fully subscribed, Discount will raise $16 million, ignoring any fees. Its assets increase to $116 million and it now has 12 million shares. Its net asset value falls from $10.00 to $9.67 ($116 million  12 million), a 3.3% dilution, as seen in Table 2. The market price would also be expected to decline, as it typically does with a rights offering. Dilution can be a major problem when a fund trades at a deep discount and the amount of money raised is small in proportion to the number of new shares.<P>



<HR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Table 2. The Effect of NAV: Discount Fund Example</STRONG>
<PRE>
Net asset value = $10.00; Market price = $8.50; Subscription price = $8.00


new capital = subscription price x new shares 
            = 8.00 x 2,000,000
            = $16,000,000



                  Before            New           After
                 Offering         Capital       Offering

---------------------------------------------------------

Assets ($)     100,000,000      16,000,000    116,000,000

Shares (No.)    10,000,000       2,000,000     12,000,000

NAV ($)           10.00              --           9.67

</PRE>
<HR>
<BR>
Conversely, if a fund trades at a sufficient premium, a rights offering can actually increase net asset value. Premium Fund has total net assets of $100 million and 10 million shares outstanding. Management wants to offer two million shares to existing stockholders. The fund trades at $11.00, 10% above its $10.00 net asset value. The subscription price is set at $10.50, a 4.5% discount from the market price. <P>


How will the offering affect shareholders' net asset value? Ignoring fees, Premium Fund will raise $21 million if the offering is fully subscribed. Its total assets increase to $121 million and it will have 12 million shares. Net asset value rises from $10 to $10.08 ($121 million  12 million), as seen in Table 3.<P>



<HR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Table 3. The Effect on NAV: Premium Fund Example</STRONG>
<PRE>
Net asset value = $10.00

Market price = $11.00

Subscription price = $10.50


New capital = subscription price x new shares
            = 10.50 x 2,000,000
            = $21,000,000


                    Before          New            After
                   Offering       Capital         Offering

</PRE>
<HR>
<BR>

The near-term effect is beneficial for shareholders because the fund traded at a 10% premium. Nevertheless, the ultimate test of the offering's success is how profitably the $21 million of new capital can be put to use.<P>


<H3>Important Difference Among Offerings</H3>


Many closed-end rights offerings are non-transferable--the rights can't be sold separately from the stock in the open market. Conversely, transferable rights can be sold in the secondary market during the "ex-rights" period by shareholders who choose not to exercise them. Non-transferable rights offerings have been called coercive by critics, since shareholders may not realize that they do not need to add to their holdings to realize their value. We'll explain later how shareholders who don't want to increase their investment can still derive the value from non-transferable rights.<P>


Arbitrageurs may seek to profit from a transferable rights offering. These large traders would sell short shares of the fund at its market price and buy rights for each share shorted, based on the subscription ratio. Shorting the stock would push its price down allowing the arbitrageurs to profit while the shareholders' value is reduced. You might also have arbitrage with a non-transferable rights offering, according to the manager of a large fund that had a non-transferable offering in 1993.<P>


Rights offerings are completed in one of the following two ways:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Internally administered by the fund company.<P>


<LI>Underwritten by an investment banking syndicate.<P>
</UL>

Underwritten offerings involve significant fees and commissions paid to firms that promote them to their retail customers. These costs, which range from 2% to 4% of the capital raised, diminish shareholders' value. Over half of the closed-end fund offerings in 1993 had these extra fees. Funds that choose the underwriting route tend to be members of large complexes that have a significant number of initial public offerings, and want to remain on good terms with their underwriters. Unfortunately, however, you as a shareholder have to absorb this cost, which is dilutive, even if you participate in the offering. Incidentally, underwriting fees were a factor leading to the shareholder's class-action suit in the Nuveen case.<P>


A good argument can be made that solicitation fees are an unnecessary expense. Morningstar data indicate the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Of the 33 rights offerings in 1993, 5 were undersubscribed.<P>


<LI>Of those 33, 12 carried no solicitation fees and all 12 of those were fully subscribed.<P>
</UL>

Internally administered offerings such as those of Adams Express, Baker Fentress, Bergstrom Capital, Royce Value Trust, and Tri-Continental, seem to be successful and cost their shareholders little in the form of fees.<P>


Duff & Phelps Utilities Income had much better experience with its $249 million internally administered offering in 1994 than it did with its $93 million underwritten offering in 1992. The first offering was undersubscribed; the more recent offering was oversubscribed. The earlier offering allowed shareholders to subscribe at net asset value (which was below market price since the fund traded at a premium) whereas the more recent offering was priced at a 10% discount to the lower of net asset value or market price, thereby passing along the benefit to the shareholders rather than the underwriters. Shareholders also received more advance notice of the second offering from Duff & Phelps, which also contributed to its greater success, according to the management.<P>


<H3>The Ideal Rights Offering</H3>


The ideal rights offering has four characteristics:<P>

<UL>
<LI>It is fully subscribed, enabling the fund to raise all the money it intends.<P>


<LI>It is successfully completed without the payment of extra fees to have broker-dealers manage the offering.<P>


<LI>It is perfectly timed and occurs in a market environment where the proceeds could be invested in securities that offer outstanding appreciation potential.<P>


<LI>It does not lead to the "strategy-dilution effect."<P>
</UL>

The fourth point refers to the fact that a rights offering may generate proceeds that the fund manager decides to invest in a type of security that the portfolio does not ordinarily focus on. For instance, a small-cap manager may invest in larger stocks if there are insufficient opportunities in small caps at the time the proceeds become available. Strategy-dilution is not common, but it can happen.<P>


Fund companies might prefer to issue rights when their shares trade at a premium to avoid dilution. But some do it when their shares are at a discount and they see good values in the stock market. Royce Value Trust, Emerging Mexico, and Latin America Investment are examples of funds that have done this. Their loyal shareholders benefited as the undervalued markets and funds subsequently rebounded. Incidentally, Royce Value Trust has had a rights offering every year since 1989 so shareholders can "dollar-cost average." Manager Charles Royce tries to increase the assets by 5% each year, using a 20:1 subscription ratio. By keeping the offerings small Royce minimizes dilution to net asset value.<P>


<H3>Be Prepared to Act</H3>


Never, never, never let a rights offering catch you off guard! First, you need to read the prospectus describing the offering carefully. The worst scenario is to do nothing. One way to be prepared is simply to have a reserve of liquid assets sufficient to participate, if you feel the conditions are right for adding to your investment.<P>


But suppose you're strapped for cash or you simply don't want to increase your dollar commitment to the fund because you feel it's not the best time. Or perhaps your fund is held in an IRA and you can't invest more. If the rights are transferable you can sell them on the open market. Do so quickly, as the stock typically declines during the offering period. This is one way to minimize your dilution.<P>


If the rights are non-transferable you can do your own arbitrage to capture at least some of their value:<P>


Assume you own 3,600 shares of a fund that has a non-transferable rights offering. The subscription ratio is 3:1, so your 3,600 shares allow you to subscribe to 1,200 new ones. The subscription price is $9.00 and the market price is $10.00. These are the same assumptions used in Table 1, where each right was found to be worth $0.25.<P>


Ignoring commissions, you could simply sell 1,200 of your shares (based on the subscription ratio) at the "ex-rights" price of $9.75 ($10.00 - $0.25), for a total of $11,700, then exercise your rights and purchase 1,200 new shares for $9.00 each, or $10,800.<P>


The result? You are $900 better off than if you had done nothing--in other words, you have made $900 before commissions and taxes, and you still hold 3,600 shares. The sooner you arbitrage, the more value you are likely to lock in.<P>


A recap of the arbitrage appears in Table 4.<P>



<HR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Table 4. Shareholder Arbitrage: What to do if Rights are Non-Transferable</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>Original position: 3,600 shs. @ $10.00 = $36,000<P>


<LI>Receive 3,600 rights; 3:1 subscription ratio @ $9.00 price<P>


<LI>Sell 1,200 shs. @ $9.75 "ex-rights" price, netting $11,700<P>


<LI>Subscribe to 1,200 shs. @ $9.00, $10,800 total cost<P>


<LI>Arbitrage profit: $11,700 - $10,800 = $900<P>


<LI>Position After Arbitrage: Value of stock $35,100 (3,600 shs. @ $9.75) + Arbitrage profit $900 = $36,000<P>


<LI>Position without Arbitrage: 3,600 shs. @ $9.75 = $35,100<P>
</UL>

<HR>



Of course, the sale of shares is a taxable event if they are held outside a tax-deferred account, and you have to pay commissions. But the sale of transferable rights would also involve a commission and be taxable, since rights have a zero cost basis.<P>


<H3>Advantages of Rights Offerings</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Rights offerings can be good for the fund and its shareholders. By raising capital in sensible amounts at opportune times the fund can build its portfolio and perhaps even lower its expense ratio a bit. Management can add new positions without having to sell off existing holdings to raise money.<P>


<LI>The offering can give you the chance to increase your ownership at a favorable price, if its terms are attractive and the fund appears to have good investment potential.<P>


<LI>Rights offerings can create buying opportunities for those who aren't shareholders. If the offering exerts sufficient downward price pressure it can result in an attractive discount for the vigilant bargain hunter.<P>


<LI>You can benefit from the oversubscription privilege if you want even more shares than you were originally entitled to. Most offerings include an oversubscription privilege, which provides for the pro rata allocation of shares for which rights were unexercised to interested shareholders at the subscription price.<P>
</UL>

<H3>Disadvantages of Rights Offerings</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Rights offerings can be dilutive. Once an offering is announced, the fund's share price tends to drop in anticipation of the dilution. Rights offerings dilute the holdings of shareholders who don't act. If the fund sells at a discount of 10% or more, dilution can be considerable.<P>


<LI>Rights offerings handled through investment bankers can be costly, since the extra broker-dealer fees can be as high as 4%. High fees can dilute all shareholders--those who participate as well as those who do not--since the fees come out of the fund's assets.<P>


<LI>Critics call them coercive. But, as we've seen, they need not be. If the rights are transferable you can sell them. If they are non-transferable you can simply sell some shares (in accordance with the subscription ratio) at the current market price and exercise your rights to restore your original position.<P>


<LI>They might be made when the market is near its peak--and the fund trades at a premium. New capital would be invested in a pricey market, even without dilution.<P>


<LI>Managements can be criticized for being greedy--using the rights offering simply to increase assets and total management fees.<P>


<LI>There can be a strategy-dilution effect if the management invests the new money in a type of security in which the fund does not normally invest.<P>


<LI>Rights offerings can be confusing to unsophisticated investors. Investing in closed-end funds requires more knowledge and homework on the part of the investor than investing in mutual funds.<P>
</UL>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>


All closed-end fund investors should understand rights offerings, even if they've invested in a fund that has never had one. You never know when you might experience one since their usage has increased dramatically during the past few years. Trying to predict whether or not a fund will have a rights offering is almost like trying to predict what the stock market is going to do.<P>


Rights offerings are relatively complex and you should think carefully if your fund presents you with the opportunity. Be sure you understand all the facts. Also, if your shares are held in street name be sure your broker contacts you about the offering; some may not.<P>


Inaction is the biggest mistake you can make.<P>

What You Should Know About Derivatives and Mutual Funds </H2><P>
<HR>

There has been much talk lately about derivatives and their use in mutual fund portfolios. If you are like most investors, you are wondering if and how these strange products are affecting your mutual funds. Although derivatives can be hard to describe because of their complexity and variety, it is still possible for you to understand their potential impact on your mutual fund investments.<P>


What are they?<P>


Derivatives are financial arrangements that are derived from, or whose performance is tied to, the changing value of an underlying security (for instance, a stock or a bond), a commodity (including currency), or a market index.<P>


You have probably at least heard of some traditional derivatives--options, futures, and currency forwards are the best-known examples. These contractual arrangements have existed for some time and are for the most part actively traded, either on an exchange or over-the-counter.<P>


In recent years, investment bankers have developed more complicated arrangements that have been dubbed "exotic" or "complex" derivatives. These include synthetic securities created from traditional securities such as bonds, and derivative contracts, which are custom-tailored contractual arrangements between two or more parties. <P>


Exotic derivatives are traded over the counter--through a dealer who makes markets in them--or directly between financial institutions; there is no formal standardized trading mechanism. Thus, the liquidity of exotic derivatives varies, as does their complexity and risk.<P>


The table at the end of this article provides a brief description of some of the more commonly used derivatives.<P>


While the risk of individual derivatives varies greatly, the biggest risk facing mutual fund investors is not the kinds of derivatives used, but rather how they are used. For instance, certain derivatives can be used to reduce portfolio risk, even though the derivative on its own is risky. This perhaps can best be termed manager risk--how the fund's portfolio manager uses derivatives in the portfolio, and in particular, whether the use is appropriate considering the fund's investment category.<P>


Fixed-income funds have received most of the attention regarding derivative use, but all kinds of funds use derivatives--although keep in mind that not all funds use derivatives (many, in fact, do not) and that many funds that do use them invest in them to only a limited extent. 


How do funds use derivatives? The primary uses are:<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Hedging:</STRONG> Some funds use certain derivatives as a hedge. A good example are currency forwards, used by both stock and bond international funds to reduce the effects of currency fluctuations. Fixed-income derivatives can also be used as a hedge to reduce interest rate risk--for instance, a manager can quickly adjust a portfolio's sensitivity to interest rate changes by either buying or selling Treasury bond futures without having to sell any of the bonds in the portfolio, providing greater flexibility while keeping transaction costs low. <P>


<LI><STRONG>Liquidity:</STRONG> Futures are used by some funds, such as stock index funds, to maintain liquidity. A futures position requires only a small initial deposit, so a fund can maintain a fully invested exposure to the stock market, while keeping cash on hand for redemptions--a cheaper and more efficient management method than selling individual stocks to meet redemptions.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Substitutes:</STRONG> Certain derivatives have the same characteristics of the underlying securities, but may be cheaper. For instance, it may be cheaper to buy the Treasury bond future than to buy the underlying Treasury bonds.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Yield Enhancement:</STRONG> Some funds use certain derivatives to enhance yield, usually by taking on some additional risk. For instance, a fund manager may exploit small differences between bond sectors--he may buy futures based on long-term municipal bonds and sell futures based on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, taking advantage of the difference in those two markets. Some of the more complex derivatives are also used for yield enhancement.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Taking a Specific Position on the Direction of Certain Interest Rates:</STRONG> Structured notes are often used for this, since they can be tailored to the portfolio manager's specific view. For instance, in one typical kind of agreement, the security may be tied to changes in short-term interest rates, but multiplied by 10 to produce changes in value similar to that of a 10-year bond. Since short-term bonds do not change in value as much as long-term bonds given a change in rates, this allows a portfolio manager with an opinion regarding short-term interest rates to receive the same potential for gain (or loss) as if he had purchased a long-term bond.<P>
</UL>

All of these uses require judgment and knowledge concerning the proper use of the derivative. However, the greatest risks are introduced when managers use derivatives to take specific positions on the direction of rates. If their forecasts are incorrect, losses can be large.<P>


Yield enhancement also introduces risks, particularly if the manager miscalculates and takes on risk that is inappropriate for the fund's category type.<P>


Certain funds that most investors would consider extremely conservative--some short-term government bond funds, for example--have dabbled in derivatives to try to boost yield. Why? Funds that are limited in choice to a specific sector, such as government bonds, and particularly to a specified maturity level, tend to have very similar yields. In order to boost yields and distinguish themselves, they must do something "different" from other funds. There are two ways such a fund can "boost" return--lower expenses or invest differently than other funds. If the fund can invest in derivatives, it can stay within its category yet take on the higher yields--and higher interest rate risk--of longer-term securities. <P>


Should you be concerned about the use of derivatives in your mutual fund?<P>


The Securities and Exchange Commission is currently examining the use of derivatives in mutual funds, as well as their disclosure. But no proposals have yet been issued. Until then, it isn't a bad idea to make sure you understand what your funds can and cannot invest in. Here are some steps you can take:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Check the prospectus to see what the fund is permitted to invest in. Make sure to read the full prospectus, and don't look for any statement concerning "derivatives." Instead, look for specific categories, such as forwards, futures, CMOs, and structured notes. Unfortunately, some funds do not disclose their derivative practices in prospectuses.<P>


<LI>Check the shareholder reports, which are required to disclose portfolio holdings, and see if there are investments that may appear to be derivatives. Again, you will not see a category labeled derivatives, but rather specific holdings, and they may be tough to spot. Also keep in mind that the fund may have invested in derivatives in the interim, but was not invested in them at the time of the report. In addition, many derivatives are listed in the "footnote" section of fund reports, since many are considered off-balance-sheet items.<P>


<LI>As a double-check, and since some funds don't disclose derivative use in prospectuses, call the fund, ask for shareholder relations, and ask whether the fund can invest in derivatives and if so, whether it currently holds any.<P>


<LI>Check the return performance of the fund, particularly if it is in a conservative or limited investment fixed-income category. Is the yield much higher than other similar funds, and if so, why? Be sure to take the expense ratio into consideration--a fund with an average yield but a higher than average expense ratio should be viewed as carefully as a fund with an above-average yield.<P>
</UL>

If a fund you are examining does use derivatives, keep in mind these questions:<P>

<UL>
<LI>To what extent are derivatives used? Some funds use them only to a limited extent. Some fund families are limiting themselves to a 5% investment in derivatives, which can serve as a conservative benchmark.<P>


<LI>How are the derivatives being used? The conservative uses include hedging and risk reduction, and to achieve liquidity. If they are used for yield enhancement, are the additional yields worth the added risk? If they are used to take a specific position on the direction of interest rates, do you trust the manager's ability to correctly forecast rates?<P>
</UL>

Here's the bottom line question:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Is the use of derivatives appropriate for the type of fund? It would be less disconcerting for an investor in a more aggressive fund to see derivatives used, for instance, for yield enhancement. Losses due to the use of derivatives would be most shocking to investors in a very conservative fund with preservation of capital as an objective.<P>
</UL>

<HR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Table. Definitions of Derivatives</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs):</STRONG> Securities derived from a group of mortgages that are divided into "tranches," classes that receive different pieces of interest and principal payments. Includes planned amortization class (PACs), structured to possess less prepayment risk, and support class, structured to absorb a higher level of prepayment risk. Can be used to enhance yield or reduce risk, depending on the class. Risk varies greatly.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Forward:</STRONG> An agreement to buy or sell a security at a specified price on a specified date. These agreements are not traded on exchanges. Forwards can be based on many kinds of assets, including currencies. Often used by funds to hedge currency risk when trading in foreign securities.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Future:</STRONG> An agreement to buy or sell a specific security at a specified price on a specified date; these contracts are standardized and traded on an exchange. Futures are based on many kinds of assets including stocks, bonds, indexes, currencies, and commodities. Used for a wide variety of purposes. Risk varies with underlying security; market risk is high due to leverage. <P>


<LI><STRONG>Interest Only Strips (IOs) and Principal Only Strips (POs):</STRONG> Securities derived from a bond (including Treasury bonds) or a mortgage-backed security, that provides only interest payments (IOs) or principal payments (POs) of the underlying issue. Has high market risk. Also has high liquidity risk.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Interest Rate Swaps:</STRONG> An arrangement between two parties that provides for an exchange of a series of cash flows at specified dates in the future--for instance, a series of fixed-rate interest payments may be exchanged for a series of variable-rate payments, although swaps can also be based on currencies and stocks. Risk varies with underlying security.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Inverse Floater (sometimes known by acronyms RIBs and IFRNs):</STRONG> A security derived from a bond (including municipal bonds) or a mortgage security that offers higher yields than the underlying security but is subject to much greater interest rate risk. As interest rates change, the coupon paid also changes, magnifying the effect of rate changes on its value. Has high market risk. Also has high liquidity risk.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Options</STRONG> The right (but not an obligation) to buy or sell a security at a specified time for a specified price. Exchange-traded options are standardized contracts. Options are based on many kinds of assets, including stocks, bonds, stock and bond indexes, and currencies. Often used to hedge, and to provide yield enhancement. Can have high market risk.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Structured Notes (also referred to as Indexed Securities):</STRONG> Agreements where interest rate and/or principal are tied to an indicator (such as short-term interest rates, the price of oil, etc.); terms can vary widely and are tailored to specific needs. Can have high market risk, depending on amount of leverage built into security. Also has high liquidity risk.<P>

Mutual Fund Q and A: Tackling the Practical Issues </H2><P>
<HR>

<strong>How many different mutual funds should I own?</strong><p>

The number of funds suitable for an individual investor will vary depending on individual circumstances--there is no universal number that applies for everyone.<p>


However, as a useful yardstick, consider the range of funds derived from the rationale that diversification should be one of every investor's goals. Simple but broad diversification would imply four funds: a domestic equity fund, a domestic bond fund, an international stock fund and an international bond fund. Dividing the domestic equity portion into two funds--one specializing in small stocks and the other larger capitalization stocks, brings the count up to five. Splitting the international equity portion into funds specializing in developed economies and funds specializing in developing and emerging economies makes six. If you prefer a separate European fund and Far East fund, the total is up to seven. Building diversity in your domestic bonds by adding a junk bond fund stretches the number of funds to eight. And if you include a money market fund, you have nine.<p>


The benefits of diversification are difficult to achieve with commitments of less than 10% of your portfolio to any one area, which sets the upper range at not much more than 10 funds. Thus, diversification implies a range of around four to nine funds--all unique in investment objective and security coverage.<p>


Overdiversification results in fund investments that essentially duplicate each other; this adds nothing to performance, but it will add frustration as well as cost in keeping track of and monitoring so many mutual funds.<p>

<br>

<strong>Should I make sure to invest in more than one fund family, for diversification?</strong> <p>


No--it is possible to stay within a fund family and be adequately diversified. However, there is a danger in remaining doggedly within one fund family solely for convenience, and that is when you overlook a better-managed fund elsewhere. For instance, rather than seek out the best international fund, you may choose the one offered by the fund family you are in currently because it is most convenient.<p>

<br>

<strong>Can a mutual fund be too large?</strong><p>


Yes. But it can also be too small. The benefits or stigmatism of size depend on the segment of the market that the fund operates in, as well as its investment style.<p>


For example, when it comes to a U.S. government bond fund, a behemoth is probably best. Large funds have lower costs, as a percentage of total assets, and the U.S. government bond market is one of the most efficient in the world, able to handle large transactions without significant price changes. Similarly, large asset bases benefit corporate bond funds by spreading expenses, and because credit risk is spread more widely among different issuers.<p>


On the equity side, index funds can benefit by size because expenses can be spread more widely. Index funds are passively managed, that is, there is no portfolio manager who is constantly making investment decisions, so the investment advisory fee is low; a low annual expense ratio is one of the advantages of investing in these kinds of funds. <p>


However, size can be a detriment to actively managed stock funds. These funds may lose some flexibility when assets reach $500 million and many eventually close before reaching $1 billion because of trading and stock selection difficulties. Actively managed funds that focus on larger companies begin to resemble index funds when assets are large and spread over many stocks, so you may be receiving a near market index return while paying extra for active management.<p>


Size can also be a detriment to funds specializing in small stocks. These stocks have less trading volume, and it can be difficult to trade larger positions without affecting prices (pushing prices up on purchase, and down when sold).<p>

<br>

<strong>What should I do when my fund closes?</strong><p>


Nothing. Many funds that close their doors to new investors will allow existing shareholders to continue to invest new money, although sometimes with limits, and all closed funds allow continuation of investments for existing IRA-type accounts. In the long run, you may be better off if your fund closes and maintains its investment style and flexibility rather than outgrowing its past success.<p>

<br>

<strong>Should I switch out of a fund if the portfolio manager changes?</strong><p>


No. The change of a portfolio manager is not reason, in and of itself, to leave a fund. Instead, monitor the fund closely to make sure the new manager is continuing the old manager's style, and that any changes won't significantly affect your investment. New portfolio managers have been known to take command of a fund and sell off securities, reflecting a change in style. A significant portfolio realignment might mean greater capital gains distributions, and therefore taxes, unless you hold the fund in a tax-sheltered account. On the other hand, if the fund is an index fund or less actively managed, the portfolio manager may not be all that important. Or the new portfolio manager may continue with the old style and perform just fine.<p>


Switch to a fund with a similar investment objective only when the performance of your fund falls off against other funds with the same investment objective, or if your existing fund changes objectives so that it no longer reflects the objective you are seeking.<p>

<br>

<strong>My fund just imposed a load. Should I bail out?</strong><p>


If your fund imposed a load, you may be grandfathered in and allowed to invest new funds without a load. But if they do charge a load on additional money you want to invest, you are faced with a dilemma. Don't sell on the news that the fund is going to impose a load, but certainly don't commit new money if you will be charged an unreasonable load.<p>

<br>

<strong>Should I be concerned with fund expenses? After all, it's already reflected in the fund's performance numbers. </strong><p>


Fund expenses, including the management fee, reduce fund performance and all quoted return numbers reflect these costs. But the reason to examine past performance is to get an indication of the portfolio manager's skill. And while the performance numbers may provide some indication of the manager's past skill, the future performance of that manager remains uncertain. The only certainty about the fund's future are the expenses, which are assessed regardless of whether a fund's performance has been relatively good or bad.<p>


Exceptionally high expenses are nearly impossible for portfolio managers to overcome relative to similar funds with average or low expenses. The lower the expenses, the better. <p>


The table below provides average expense ratios (expenses as a percentage of total assets managed) for various types of mutual funds. These can provide you with some guidelines when examining individual fund expenses. Expense ratio and expense breakdown for individual funds are given in the mutual fund prospectus.<p>

<strong>Should I pay any attention to mutual fund portfolio turnover ratios?</strong><p>


The portfolio turnover ratio (given in the prospectus) is the lower of purchases or sales of assets in the fund relative to the average assets in the fund for the year. A turnover ratio of 100% indicates that the dollar value of fund purchases or sales equaled the dollar value of total fund assets during the year.The higher the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which can hurt the performance of the fund; while these costs are reflected in the fund's net asset value and its performance figures, they are a concern for the future performance as noted in the question above.<p>


Equally important for taxable investors, the higher the turnover, the more likely the fund is to make capital gains distributions; and taxes must be paid on these distributions.<p>


What is high turnover and what is low? Stock funds average around 80% portfolio turnover, and bond funds are close to 100%. Use portfolio turnover as a tie-breaker. If you find two funds in the same category that are equally appealing, lean toward the fund with a lower portfolio turnover.<p>

Mutual Fund Services: Investing and Redeeming Shares </H2><P>
<HR>

Mutual funds services can often help you manage your investments in a simpler, more efficient manner. That includes the buying and selling of fund shares. Whether you are making a single transaction or setting up a systematic plan, a variety of options exist for investing and redeeming mutual fund shares.<p>


What are your options and how can they best be utilized?<p>


The traditional way of investing in a fund is simply to place a check in the mail. But it could take up to a week--or longer--for your money to arrive and be put to work. By letting a few days elapse you risk paying more per share for a volatile fund than you had expected. Of course, if you're lucky you might pay less.<p>


It frequently makes sense to have a better idea about the price you will pay, especially if you're going to invest a fairly large sum in a more volatile fund. By taking action prior to 4 p.m. Eastern time, it's possible to buy at the price prevailing on the day you place your order. Of course, the price you'll pay is not the only consideration--putting the money to work sooner is beneficial to fixed-income investors who are placing a large amount--say $50,000 or more--into an account and don't want to wait to begin accruing dividends.<p>


There are several ways to accomplish the purchase of shares at that day's net asset value:<p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Transfer from a money fund.</strong> You can park your investment in the family's money market fund, wait until you're ready to invest, call the company before 4 p.m. Eastern time and request that the funds be transferred to the portfolio of your choice. Of course, you can usually also transfer from other bond and equity funds in the group.<p>


<li><strong>Wire transfer from your bank.</strong> This is the quickest way to move money and is especially recommended for large sums. You will buy in at the day's net asset value if the wire arrives at your account prior to 4 p.m. Eastern time. Your fund company will provide the instructions that you need to convey to your bank. Banks generally charge for this service but mutual funds usually do not. <p>


<li><strong>Telephone purchase.</strong> Some companies allow you to place a purchase order by phone, locking in that day's price if your order is entered before 4 p.m. Eastern time. You give your instructions to the telephone representative, then send a check or wire for the cost. The payment must reach the account in five or seven business days (depending on the requirements of the company), otherwise the order will be canceled with the investor assuming any resultant losses. Some funds will only accept wires for telephone purchases.<p>


There are special conditions that need to be satisfied when you place a telephone purchase order. These requirements, which vary by company, typically include investment minimums and maximums. Minimums may or may not be higher than the fund's usual investment minimum and could be $5,000 or $10,000. The maximum may be based on the total value of your existing accounts with the family. The details should be spelled out in the prospectus. It's best to verify the information with a shareholder representative before entering your order.<p>


<li><strong>Opening a new account by wire.</strong> A number of mutual funds allow you to establish an account by wire, provided you promptly send in a completed application and wire in the cost of your shares. If your wire arrives at your new account before 4 p.m. Eastern time you will buy at the current day's price. Again, there are minimum investment requirements and other details that vary by fund. The first step is to phone the fund for instructions.<p>
</ul>

The best way to build up your mutual fund assets is simply to put money to work on a regular basis. Systematic investment plans offer an ideal way to do this. With fixed, periodic investments, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer when they're high. This results in a lower average cost per share than a simple average of prices on your purchase dates. Dollar-cost averaging works especially well with more volatile portfolios.<p>


There are several ways periodic investments can be made automatically, without sending in a check.<p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Direct, systematic transfers.</strong> The systematic investment program, where money is taken either from your bank account or paycheck, transfers a predetermined, fixed amount at approximately the same date each month. In order for the payments to be routed directly from your bank account, your financial institution must be an Automated Clearing House (ACH) member, which most are. If you want the investment deducted directly from your paycheck, you need your employer's consent.<p>


<li><strong>Dividend transfers.</strong> By investing periodic distributions received from one mutual fund into shares of another in the same family, you can build a position in the latter. For example, the monthly dividends from a fixed-income fund could be moved into an aggressive growth portfolio.  Another example might be the transfer of quarterly income dividends and annual capital gains distributions from an equity-income fund into shares of a money market fund or shares of a short-term bond fund.<p>
</ul>

A variety of useful approaches are also available when you need to withdraw money from your mutual fund.<p>


Mailing in a redemption letter is the old-fashioned way to withdraw money from a fund account. The letter must contain the necessary information--including name(s) of registered owner(s), fund name, account number and redemption amount--and be properly signed by the account owner(s). You may need a signature guarantee for your request to be processed.<p>


There are several faster, simpler ways to redeem shares. Be sure to sign up for these additional services, if necessary.<p>

<ul>
<li>Requesting a check by phone. You may telephone your shareholder representative and request that a check be mailed to you or your bank. Of course, you lose interest during the mail transit time, an important consideration with larger redemptions.<p>


<li>Drawing a check on a fixed-income fund. You can write a check on a money market or other fixed-income fund, perhaps on money just transferred in from another portfolio in the family. Funds generally place a minimum, commonly $100 or $500, on individual checks. If you draw your check on a fund with a fluctuating share price, it would give rise to a taxable event. Money market funds ordinarily maintain a stable $1 price, so you need not be concerned about taxable events when drawing checks on these funds.<p>


<li>Wiring money from your fund. You can request your company to wire the proceeds to your bank account. This is the quickest way to make a direct transfer of money, and it is recommended for large sums. Your bank and fund will tell you about their fee policies.<p>


<li>Making an ACH redemption. If you have established an Automated Clearing House linkage between your fund and bank, you can simply phone your company and request that the balance be transferred to your bank. However, it could take a few days for the money to reach your account.<p>
</ul>

Systematic withdrawal plans are useful for retirees and others who want to receive regular monthly or quarterly checks. The payments could be sent to someone besides the account holder, such as a student in college or another dependent. A certain minimum account balance, such as $10,000, is required to establish the program. You can change your withdrawals or discontinue them at will. Most funds offer systematic withdrawal programs.<p>


While withdrawal plans are a useful service they can lead to certain problems.  For instance, recordkeeping for tax purposes can be a headache, especially with more frequent redemptions. Each time you make a withdrawal you're selling shares, which results in a taxable event. You need to adopt a systematic procedure for calculating gains and losses on each withdrawal. In addition, volatile, aggressive growth and sector equity funds (like gold portfolios) are generally poor candidates for withdrawal plans. These funds can plunge as fast as they can surge. Withdrawing money when the value of your account has taken a steep decline can lead to problems if it doesn't rebound quickly.<p>


Also, it's a good idea to reevaluate your situation every year or so if you are using the systematic withdrawal option. Do some revised number-crunching to see if you need to make any adjustments in your withdrawals.<p>


Shareholder services can help make your dealings with a fund simpler, more efficient and more pleasant--and possibly a bit more profitable. Keep in mind that there are differences in the services offered by different funds, and differences on restrictions or conditions they may place on their use. There may also be charges for some services such as wire transfers and telephone exchanges. Fund companies will provide you with details.<p>

HOG PRODUCTION PROJECT
</H3><P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>A.	INTRODUCTION</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>Increasing complaints by non-farm dwellers are creating a serious
problem for intensive livestock production facilities.  These complaints
arise from concerns about the odour and the potential for environmental problems,
and could prevent the establishment of new production units or the expansion
of existing units.  The future growth of the livestock industry is at risk
due to this problem.  In particular, the hog industry currently faces the
greatest pressures.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Company Analysis</B>: 
<P ALIGN=Left>P.M.G. AGRI TECH was formed in the spring of 1995 by Mr. Jerry
Sorokowski as a vehicle to develop a vertically integrated hog production
industry utilizing innovative, commercially viable and ecologically sustainable
solutions to the waste management problems of intensive livestock operations.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Business Profile</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>Phase 1 of P.M.G. AGRI TECH'S vertical integration expansion
is aimed at a coordinated sow supply and hog finishing operation.  The scale
of achieving proper capacity utilization has been determined as follows:
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183; one 5,000 sow barn
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183; eighteen 2,000 hog finishing barns
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183; one small scale meat processing plant.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>Returns in the order of 40% on investment are currently being
achieved in the industry and are projected for this project.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Current Practices</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>The current practice is generally stand alone agricultural
operations with no degree of integration, no economies of scale and negotiated
supply subject to market fluctuations.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>B.	TREND ANALYSIS</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Industry</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>Industrial reorganization is playing a significant role in
the new structure of the international pork industry.  Global trends suggest
there will be fewer, larger, and more specialized production units and processors
with large-scale kill-floors.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>Primary hog production across North America has undergone change
in the past fifteen years.  As with most aspects of agriculture, hog production
is becoming more and more concentrated with fewer, larger producers.  In
Manitoba, for example, 23.5% of producers were responsible for 80.5% of all
hogs produced, with 4.9% of hog farms producing 44.7%.  Over the past 15
years, the number of hogs produced has risen from 1 million to over 2.3 million
per year while the number of individual producers has declined significantly.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>In the United States the pork industry is attracting companies
backed by large banks and investment capital.  These companies' operations
are fully integrated &endash; from the barns and production to the processing
plants and retail outlets.  It is estimated that 50 percent of hog production
in the USA will be integrated under processor control by the turn of the
century.  This indicates that economies of scale are an important consideration
to competitive hog production, packing and processing.  The following are
further indicators of these trends in the United States:
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	500 sows is considered a small farm,
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	fully integrated operations in North and South Carolina,
Missouri, Iowa and other states,
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	development of mega hog farms in mid-western states,
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	growing contractual relations between producers, feed
companies, and packers, and 
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	relocation of pork processing firms (and associated
production) to states with minimum environmental regulations and requirements.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>In general, the commercial character of the US Industry is
being shaped by numerically small, but commercially very large producers
and processors.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>However, environmental issues in some countries are already
acting as constraints to the pork industry.  Taiwan, a country that exports
4 million hogs per year, will be cutting its exports, in part, for environmental
reasons.  The Netherlands, a strong competitor in the pork industry, is
constrained by a lack of land area for its manure disposal, and similar
challenges are faced by Belgium.  In Manitoba, applications for the construction
of new hog barns have been denied zoning approval, due to concerns about
odour and water contamination.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Ecological</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>A high concentration of hogs in a single location brings with
it real and perceived environmental and aesthetic difficulties.  These concerns
limit the establishment and operation of large hog production units.  The
Manitoba Pork Study Committee Report indicates that without a satisfactory
solution to the problems of manure management associated with these large
units, intensive hog operations cannot be considered sustainable development.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>The odours produced from hog housing facilities, manure storage
and land spreading of manure are of concern in England, the Netherlands,
Denmark as well as Manitoba according to the report of the Manitoba Manure
Technology Transfer Mission.  
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>In the Netherlands, concern about acid rain and the impact
of ammonia emissions from manure is very high.  Mission countries are conducting
considerable research and monitoring of the greenhouse gases, methane and
nitrous oxide, emitted by manure.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>High nitrate levels in groundwater are a serious concern in
all three Mission countries.  As well, there is general concern in Manitoba
about any mineral excess in the environment and diligence is required to
ensure that nitrate levels remain within acceptable limits.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>Furthermore, manure can cause pollution of surface water when
runoff from manured fields, solid storage areas and livestock pens enters
watercourses.  This surface water contamination can be due to excessive nitrogen,
phosphorus or micro-organisms entering the water.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Sociological</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>Odour is a major issue raised in some communities regarding
the development of new hog enterprises.  Manitoba Agriculture states that
"odours are one of the main causes of conflicts between livestock producers
and their neighbours."  In a telephone survey of rural residents, conducted
by Decision Research Inc. for Saskatoon's Agriculture 2000, the primary concern
about large hog operations was odour, with concern about the protection of
the aquifer running second.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>Odours are produced by the anaerobic decomposition of the manure,
most of which occurs while the manure is in storage.  The two main sources
of odours are open liquid manure storages and liquid manure that is spread
on fields.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Technological</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>While the problem of agricultural waste has been identified,
the solution, to date, is to deal with the problem by controlling it rather
than resolving it.  In its Farm Practices Guidelines, Manitoba Agriculture
devotes little space to alternative methods of manure management and deals
almost exclusively with liquid manure handling techniques, recommendations
and regulations.  It is clear that as yet Manitoba Agriculture has not identified
viable alternatives.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Economic</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>There is a strong correlation between income and meat consumption.
 It follows that strong economic growth in developing countries is leading
to higher per capita meat consumption.  In particular, consumption of pork
products around the world is increasing, with the world consumption of pork
equaling 68.8 million tonnes in 1993.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Legal</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>Water contamination is an environmental and a health concern.
 The pollution of water, either surface or underground is illegal in many
locals.  Water pollution is regulated under The Public Health Act and the
Environment Act.  Manitoba Environment is assigned the responsibility to
prevent, monitor and assess water pollution and to prosecute violators when
necessary.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>The environmental issue relative to the financing of hog barns
and operations is similar to that of potentially contaminated sites for other
industries. Lending institutions are not prepared to accept the possibility
that they may be liable for clean-up costs of an environmental accident at
a hog barn location.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Political </B>
<P ALIGN=Left>A challenge to industry and agri-businesses in Manitoba is
clearly identified in the Report to the Government of Manitoba prepared by
the Manitoba Pork Study committee in August, 1994 titled "Manitoba's Pork
Industry: Building for the 21st Century".  The challenge from government
is to double pork processing and hog production in Manitoba by the year 2000.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>The Province of Manitoba is a leader in finding and developing
innovative ways to encourage sustainable development in all sectors.  The
Premier's Round Table on the Environment and the Economy and the International
Institute for Sustainable Development in Winnipeg are two indicators that
development can no longer stand alone but must be considered in the context
of its effects on others and on the environment.  By locating in Manitoba,
P.M.G. AGRI TECH should be well positioned to benefit from this positive
political climate.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Regulatory</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>In many hog producing countries, surface and groundwater
contamination resulting from hog lagoon breaks and overflows is leading to
a trend towards greater regulation of livestock manure management.  There
are numerous indicators of this trend, of which the following are several
examples.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
environmental committee is working  to establish new principles and codes
of practice which will have major implications for the harmonization of
appropriate environmental policies and practices for hog production.  One
can anticipate economic penalties built into the GATT trade rules for suppliers
of pork where the cost of production is significantly reduced at the expense
of the environment.  
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	In North Carolina, after the summer of 1995, which "will
be remembered as a disaster for the state's swine industry" because of a
number of serious hog lagoon spills, "top officials are daring to suggest
that large hog farms aren't really farms, but industrial operations that
should be regulated as such." 
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	Manitoba Agriculture has developed "Farm Practises
Guidelines for Hog Producers in Manitoba."  In these guidelines, Manitoba
Agriculture states that "the viability of the livestock industry is dependent
on the sustainability of the environment."   As well, it predicts that there
will be increasing pressure to closely regulate hog operations.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	The Manitoba Pork Study Committee in its "Recommendations
for Sustainable Development" gives a strong mandate for action in addressing
the problem of liquid manure.  The relevant items are:
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>8.	That guidelines and regulation be continually monitored
to ensure that the latest technology improvements are applied to new industry
development, whether by expansion or new project start-ups.
<P ALIGN=Left>9.	That research and development of new by-product management
systems be encouraged.  There will be opportunities to sell this technology
to competing hog producing countries that have more intensive hog farming
and even greater environmental needs than Manitoba.
<P ALIGN=Left>10.	That the Manitoba Agricultural Services Coordinating Committee
ensure effective processes, including the establishment of dedicated
subcommittees if necessary, to proactively address the issues of sustainable
production efficiencies and innovative waste management technologies for
the pork industries.  These processes must ensure appropriate participation
of industry representatives. 
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>C.	OPPORTUNITIES, THREATS AND ISSUES</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Opportunities</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>In Manitoba, the political will to promote a doubling of the
hog industry, combined with the economic, legal, technological, sociological,
ecological and regulatory trends explored above, and the political desire
to promote exportable technologies provides a substantial opportunity for
a well managed and coordinated vertically integrated operation.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Threats</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>There are two primary threats to P.M.G. AGRI TECH'S ability
to capitalize on the opportunity described above.  Firstly, it is possible
that the market growth projected will not be attained.  Secondly, there is
the possibility that, even if the market growth is attained, that the prices
will be insufficient to yeild a good return on investment.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Issues</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>Given the problems identified above, the substantial opportunity
available and the moderate to small threats, the key issue becomes the
successful, timely, properly financed management of the vertically integrated
concept.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>D.	BUSINESS ACTION PLAN</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>The implementation of P.M.G. AGRI TECH'S business strategy
will consist of two components which will be pursued concurrently:
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>1)	The company will secure financing in the amount of $25 million
CDN. to enable it to proceed with the project.
<P ALIGN=Left>2)	The planned project, physical and implementation, management.

<P>
Market studies calculate value assessments with the accuracy of information
made known to the writing team. They in turn point to probable and quantifiable
markets. Very seldom does a product present itself that has a market beyond
the scope of normal business parameters. 
<P>
In the final analysis, numerous colossal markets were identified for the
products that Remedial Air Systems INC. could introduce globally.
<P>
<P>
The products from Remedial Air Systems are a new branch of an existing
technology. Their succinct purpose is to bring the healthy conditions of
natural outdoor air ; by replicating nature's methods ; indoors. That is
what this study, in distinction, is all about. The supporting information
clearly shows that there is a specific market that Remedial Air Systems Inc.
will have at its command. 
<P>
We invite you to read the study in it's entirety and come to your own conclusions
about the new products that Remedial Air Systems will advance as to their
likelihood of being a boon to society. We also boldly state that if Remedial
Air Systems follow their perquisite path of action, then the company stands
a far above average prospect of becoming a World Leader for this burgeoning
new product technology !

  SUMMARY :
</H3>
<P ALIGN=Left>
The company and the Canadian Inventor has achieved both a marketing and technical
breakthrough which will initiate and extend the use of Negative Ionization
Systems to clean and freshen the air in plant and office buildings.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The installations are in full compliance with all CSA and Canadian Electrical
Building codes ( Rev. 1991 ) regulatory requirements permitting the use of
the system in areas where flash off vapour or potentially explosive dust
concentrations may be present.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The "Ion Wash" system designed specifically for the paint and coating facilities
of U.S. Automotive manufacturers has overcome a long standing problem with
fine dust and dirt where a short in-line ionized section replaces plastic
screens running almost the full length of the facility.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The FORD Automotive Company obtained a significant reduction in the inclusions
experienced during the finishing of car bodies and has fully endorsed the
installations for international use.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The flexible and highly adaptable nature of the system can be applied in
all situations where fine dust and dirt is a problem during manufacture,
which according to the company' survey is not confined only to paint and
coating processing.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The Canadian Inventor ( Robertson ) has achieved a technical breakthrough
with a new layered process that is put down like a chip process hence it
is termed the "ION CHIP" invention which in conjunction with some innovations
to generate and introduce Negative Ions to increase the beneficial or remedial
effect, ensures that systems to control and inhibit bacteria can be designed
and marketed.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The advances in technology which are considered to be patentable will be
employed to provide a coordinated solution to the "Sick Building syndrome"
which is the goal of the company.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The equipment required remains simple using standard material so that highly
acceptable profit margins with increased market penetration will be realized.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  1. A Technology for our Times
</H3>
<P>
The inherent capabilities of negative ionization to clean and freshen the
air is a well documented, natural phenomena. To take advantage of it in our
modern age to overcome problems we have created for ourselves with contaminated
and poor indoor air quality becomes a matter of replicating this natural
outdoor phenomena within our enclosed environments.
<P>
While this has been done by many others quite successfully on a small scale,
it is the view and contention of the Company that with the prevalence and
multiplicity of problems caused by airborne dust and biological contamination
in our buildings large scale systems should be developed utilizing all the
remedial characteristics and capabilities of negative air ionization if solutions
to such problems are to be realized.
<P>
This conclusion was reached after exhaustive feasibility studies and an
evaluation of field trials carried out both in the United Kingdom and elsewhere
over an eight year period. During this time the widespread and diverse nature
of the problems were identified and the prospects for their solutions assessed.
The Company has formulated a unique and innovative approach to apply the
technology, with a breakthrough invention about to be fully protected by
patent which will allow the implementation of a strategic core business plan
(the ion chip).
<P>
The plan coordinates a program of scientific research and experimental product
development with a marketing strategy to commercialize the technology in
stages, starting with applications in manufacturing and commercial applications
where the results will be immediately beneficial to customers and the Company.
<P>
Always moving towards the goal of providing a solution to the now universally
recognized "Sick Building Syndrome".
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  2. The Sick Building Syndrome
</H3>
<P>
Government agencies in both Canada and the USA rate the quality of indoor
air so bad that they consider indoor air as their Nations' largest pollution
problem and estimate between 50% to 70% of all buildings in North America
to have Sick Building Syndrome to one degree or another.
<P>
Further research indicated that people spend almost 90% of their time indoors;
either at work or in the home.
<P>
It is now generally accepted that the cause of the problem, while multi-faceted,
has its roots in the oil crisis with the sealing of buildings for energy
conservation and reducing the costs on a year round basis for heating and
air-conditioning.
<P>
The remedial action of negative ionization demonstrably can control the
circulation and re-circulation of building pollutants at the same time a
natural balance between the beneficial negative ions and the sometimes harmful
positive ions can be achieved.
<P>
Apart from the obvious benefit of clean fresh air to the building occupants
there is considerable evidence that the benefits of negative ionization extends
to decreasing fatigue, increasing alertness and relieving stress with individuals
performing complicated repetitive tasks such as computer rooms, supervisory
control rooms and air traffic control centres.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  3. Scope of Indoor Pollution and Field Trials
</H3>
<P>
The problems with airborne contamination and poor indoor air quality are
a by product of our industrialized society where the demand is for increased
product quality and productivity.
<P>
The industries identified as having problems with indoor air pollution and
where field trials have proven effective with customer verification of increased
productivity and improved product quality or improved health and safety include;
<UL>
  <LI>
    &#183; Paint and Coating Facilities
  <LI>
    &#183; Plastic Industry
  <LI>
    &#183; Glass Industry
  <LI>
    &#183; Textile Industry
  <LI>
    &#183; Hog Barns/Horse Stables/Poultry Barns
  <LI>
    &#183; Food Production
  <LI>
    &#183; Printing and Silk Screening
  <LI>
    &#183; Paper Industry
  <LI>
    &#183; Additions to Clean Rooms
  <LI>
    &#183; Offices
</UL>
<P>
<P>
In most instances, the problems were so acute that the customer was quite
prepared to overlook the crude nature of the installations and any deficiencies
of an engineering or safety nature and in particular the susceptibility of
the emitter to damage during cleaning and maintenance procedures.
<P>
The adherence to some degree of clean room protocol to ensure long term results
was often suspect in a number of the trials.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  4. PROFITABILITY AND GROWTH
</H3>
<P>
a) The manufacturing and installation of negative ionization systems is extremely
simple requiring only standard components and materials which are readily
available so that the company can realize very attractive profit margins.
<P>
b) Increasing the attractiveness of further investment in scientific Research
and Product Development are the innovations and adaptability made possible
by the latest "ION CHIP" invention.
<P>
c) Based on preliminary searches it is anticipated that a patent application
for the Ion Chip invention will be obtained in both Canada and the USA This
should ensure that the company retains its front edge in the embryonic technology
for many years providing a secure base for expansion.
<P>
d) The combination of the ION CHIP with the modes of operation devised to
deploy, distribute, and augment, the generation of Negative Ions will be
the major opportunities gained to commercialize the technology.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>

</UL>
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  5.2 Marketing Strategy
</H3>
<P>
<B>Sales Policy</B>
<P>
Negative ionization systems must not be considered as being a substitute
or a competitor to a properly designed air handling and treatment facility
nor as having the capability to compensate for basic faulty designs in
ventilation.
<P>
Rather, the Company systems add a new dimension to conventional air treatment
to ensure that activities can proceed in any enclosed environment with assurance
that airborne contamination will be minimal and air quality otherwise improved.
<P>
Also an acceptance of clean room protocol by the customers, employees, is
mandatory.
<P>
<P>
<B>Incremental Marketing</B>
<P>
The systems will be developed and marketed on an incremental basis triggered
by the completion and success of each phase of the SR and EP development
program.
<P>
In turn, the SR and EP program will be prioritized on the basis of the simpler
requirements of the system most readily assessed results and where the customers
ROI can be most attractive. This would suggest:
<P>
Control of Dust and Static ( Dirt )
<P>
&#183; Paint and Coating Operations
<P>
&#183; General Manufacturing
<P>
&#183; Clean Room Additions
<P>
Control of Biological Contamination ( Hygiene )
<P>
&#183; Rearing of Livestock
<P>
&#183; Food Production
<P>
&#183; Medical Establishments
<P>
Control of Ion Concentration
<P>
&#183; Sick Buildings
<P>
&#183; Control Rooms
<P>
&#183; Aircraft/Buses
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  6. Progress To Date
</H3>
<P>
<B>Patents</B>
<P>
The ion chip device patent application, which supersedes previous designs,
has been drafted and will now be put in the hands of a patent agent.
<P>
<B>Regulatory Approval</B>
<P>
With the equipment CSA approved and installations in compliance with the
1991 revision of the Canadian Electrical Building Code for HV/extra low powered
electronically sourced, the major hurdle to marketing the systems for virtually
all applications has been overcome.
<P>
<B>Performance of Systems</B>
<P>
Control of static and dust particulate migration demonstrated by the
installations sold to the major U.S. automotive manufacturers.
<P>
<B>Control of airborne biological contamination verified by the results of
the dental surgery project.</B>
<P>
Control of air ion density for all applications can be done with the ion
chip design concept and use of the three modes: Passive; Modulation; and
Interaction to introduce and distribute the requisite volume of negative
ions to maximize the remedial ion effect in any particular situation.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  7. The Way Ahead

<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  8. The ION CHIP Invention
</H3>
<P>
While some experience and know how is required with the understanding of
the High Voltage / Extremely Low power supplies, choice of polarity, HV threshold
levels, cold sparking, minimum ignition energy; ozone restrictions; mostly
factors concerning the safety and replicating of the outdoor "Ion Effect"
phenomenon within enclosed environments. The key to on going successful
commercialization of the technology is the design and construction of the
emission devices.
<P>
The Ion Chip invention provides this key, allowing company designers of the
future systems the opportunity to maximize all the beneficial and remedial
characteristics which result from the proper introduction of negative ionization
by one or other of three basic modes, passive, modulation and interactive
providing -
<P>
control of air borne particles
<P>
control of electro-static conditions
<P>
control of bacterial / viral growth
<P>
control of air ion mix and density
<P>
Thereby, adding a "new dimension" for consideration to upgrade the performance
of conventional air handling and treatment systems with a decided cost advantage
over alternative methodologies; with minimum energy consumption , maintenance
and capital expenditure.
<P>
<P>
In summary, the advantages of the Ion Chip device include;
<UL>
  <LI>
    simplicity with operational safety
  <LI>
    stable predictable ion output
  <LI>
    mechanical strength
  <LI>
    easily cleaned with the minimum maintenance
  <LI>
    self contained removable units
  <LI>
    accommodates all modes of operation
  <LI>
    allows emitters of almost any size and configuration
  <LI>
    provides for the development of new materials
</UL>
<P>
Based on some earlier searches, it is anticipated that the "Ion Chip"device
can be protected by patents including the products and systems which can
now be developed and commercialized by the company.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  8.2 MODES OF OPERATION :
</H3>
<P>
There are Three basic methods to introduce Negative Air Ions into an air
space:
<P>
<B>Passive or Natural Mode</B>
<P>
The passive mode is where a series of strategically placed emitters mounted
at a height of 8 to 10 Ft; kept constantly energized from a High Voltage
/ Extremely Low Power source will provide a distribution or " SHOWER of Negative
Ions to cause a natural precipitation of any accumulation of air borne particles
in the air space.
<P>
Depending upon the volume of the particles already in the suspension there
will be a purge period usually between 24 to 48 hours to allow the ions to
progressively disperse this accumulation.
<P>
Subsequently a constant level of negative ions will then be available to
immediately precipitate any new particles being generated by activities taking
place below the emitters.
<P>
In situations where air borne particles must be contained in a work area,
a series of closely spaced emitters can form an "Ion Barrier" to prevent
migration to other areas.
<P>
It may be noted that particles precipitated by this passive action will be
prevented from becoming air borne again as long as the emitters remain energized
and violent air disturbances are avoided.
<P>
For industrial use, longitudinal style emitters appear to provide the most
effective distribution and concentration of ions.
<P>
With office applications the emitters could take the form of ceiling tiles
primarily for aesthetic reasons.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  MODULATION:
</H3>
<P>
Modulation air passed through the body of the emitter acts upon the corona
forming element and increases the ion output proportional to the air flow.
This air also serves to clean the device and exposes additional points for
corona. Modulation can be employed in applications where it is desired to
counteract periodic dust or contamination generating activities.
<P>
Medical applications requiring relatively high ion concentration and possibly
aerosol enrichment to maximize the inhibition of bacteria and viruses.
<P>
With confinement reading of animals during feeding times
<P>
High activity manufacturing areas.<BR>
  <HR>
<H3>
  INTERACTIVE:
</H3>
<P>
The "Interactive mode" is to incorporate the emitters with conventional air
diffusers and distribution arrangements.
<P>
Part of the emitters positioned in the ventilation air stream will increase
the ions discharged as a function of the air velocity and be ideally distributed.
<P>
The lower part of the arrangement parallel to the floor will act in the passive
mode at all times independent of the ventilating air.

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">CanTalk Inc. founded in October 1993, is headquartered
in Winnipeg, Manitoba and is the solely Canadian-owned company to offer the
business community a broad selection of language and cultural services "on
demand" using the fax, phone, E-Mail and Internet. With quality and custom
design as its touchstones, CanTalk is not only a new way to market language
services with leading edge technology but also a new method by which Canadian
businesses and public services can gain rapid access to those services. Offering
the customer greater choices and convenience in language services, using
telecommunications technology, serves a unique market niche. The provision
of language services in a call centre format is also a strong feature
differentiating CanTalk from traditional language services. Because of these
distinctions, CanTalk is very well positioned to provide what the customer
needs...when they want it. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">In alliance with Canadian telephone companies and
serving a national customer base, CanTalk is a network of nearly 1,000
professional and certified interpreters and translators, skilled in the diverse
languages and cultures of centres throughout North America and the world.
In addition to its own network, CanTalk has forged major alliances across
Canada with traditional, seasoned language companies, as well as business
organizations and companies with strong ties to key markets. Not only are
they resource pools, but also a source of customer leads and buy-ins. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">In Canada, the language and cultural services market
is in its infancy but rapidly gaining momentum. AT&amp;T'S Language Line,
and Interpretel's entry into the Canadian market, speak to the opportunities
for this service. They are filling a service void that no other Canadian
company to date has filled. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">To achieve growth, businesses are waking up to
the reality that they must market directly to culturally diverse customer
bases. In this light, CanTalk is both a solution and opportunity. It provides
a rapid, convenient and affordable solution to language and cultural barriers
that often get in the way of conducting business in North America and around
the world. Frustrations can be turned into revenue generating opportunities.
Improving communication links from one country and from one community to
the next can solve problems on the spot, forge new relationships with clients
and enhance existing ones. As a cost-effective communications tool, CanTalk
can value-add to almost any current service and complement any existing
infrastructure. With a comprehensive mix of language and cultural services
geared to the user's convenience, CanTalk is positioned to ensure affordability,
accuracy, reliable delivery, above all, easy access and simplicity of use
for the customer. All that is required is a phone, fax or computer. This
will have wide appeal for a multitude of business sectors in the Canadian,
American and international markets. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The company was established with equity capital
funding by the founders and a federal government support program. The CanTalk
management team brings 50 years of combined project management experience
that embraces communications and marketing; management of interpreters and
translators in an international setting; administration of large budgets
and staff; information systems management; computer technology and design,
as well as the design of numerous technically oriented programs for consumer
groups; and strong experience in telecommunications and engineering projects
involving several significant product and service introductions. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Using Manitoba as a template, CanTalk is advancing
its service within a framework of local linguistic diversity and resources
with the geographic advantage of a central time zone. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Some of CanTalk's significant customers that are
coming on line include: Investors Financial Group, representing a 40,000-customer
base in the mortgage area; the Manitoba government and its overseas initiatives;
the Canadian Bar Association of Ontario (CBAO), representing 14,000 members;
Vista Medical, representing thousands of clients; and Manitoba Telephone
System call centres with potentially hundreds of calls per week. CanTalk
is currently in the process of negotiating with major customer groups including
the federal government of Canada, a large North America-wide call centre,
major Hotels and a Canadian airline company. Business alliances being negotiated
include the Canadian Business Service Centre in Winnipeg (with Industry Canada),
and the Asia Pacific Foundation. As well, there are alliances with sophisticated
Internet providers who are aggressively marketing to large customer bases.

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">With the capability to provide service seven days
a week, 24 hours a day, CanTalk offers up to 80 languages used in North American
cities and many countries worldwide. As well, it can provide customs and
cultural information for over 20 countries. At the core of its service is
a language centre administering an initial network of approximately 1,000
professional and certified interpreters and translators, secured with legal
contracts and working on a scheduled basis. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">CanTalk's custom design focus and specialized language
services, backed by personalized service, are its key attributes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Where oral interpretation is needed, customers
are connected to interpreters in third-party conference call arrangements
- customer initiated or CanTalk aided. All interpretation services are geared
to convenience and the needs of the customer. With written translation, documents
by fax and E-mail are given turnaround guarantees. Requests for information
and cultural consultation requirements are handled in much the same manner.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The CanTalk language service centre connects customers
by phone in "live" or real time conference call arrangements to a network
of professional Canadian interpreters. They can provide consecutive
interpretation over the phone on an immediate (less than two minutes), callback
(less than 10 minutes) or pre-booked (2 hours to 2 weeks) basis. Where
translation is required, fax calls are directed to CanTalk's certified
translators, who will translate short documents by fax within three to six
hours. Longer documents take 12 hours or longer depending on customer
requirements. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Many provisions for maintaining confidentiality
have been implemented. Great care is taken to ensure the rights and privacy
of each customer is maintained. Not only are our interpreters and translators
legally contracted with confidentiality clauses and a code of ethics, they
are bound as well to their own professional code of ethics. The language
service centre operation is also equipped with a number of security provisions
- the name of the client never has to be revealed to an interpreter or
translator. <BR>

<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">CanTalk's language services - the multiplicity
of offerings backed by telecommunications solutions, geared to the convenience
and affordability of the user &ugrave; have entered a large window of
opportunity. At a time of rising interest in language services, due largely
to globalization of business and more businesses embracing cultural diversity
in their customer relations, the potential has never been greater. It is
everywhere. The CanTalk concept, with telco backing has unlimited opportunity
in the Canadian, North American and international markets. The strongest
potential can be seen in the areas of travel, tourism and hospitality, call
centres, education, international marketing, financial institutions, governments
and healthcare. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Nationally, Most Canadian organizations and businesses
have no reliable information and user system in place for the approximately
two to three per cent of the population that will never speak either official
language (Statistics Canada). By the year 2000, visible minorities comprising
20% of the population are expected to have a per capita GDP higher proportionally
than the rest of the Canadian population.Their purchasing power will rise
from $76 billion to $310 billion by the year 2000. To better serve customers
who prefer to speak other languages, there is growing awareness that providing
language support opens the door to new customer growth. This is evidenced
by the number of major institutions, Air Canada, Toronto Dominion Bank, call
centres, insurance companies and other businesses that hire multilingual
service representatives. This is also a time when federal cutbacks will
dramatically affect the current service providers on the immigration front
lines. Government has given some clear signals that they would like to move
away from the cost of servicing multiculturalism and all its ancillary
services.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">On the international front is the federal and
provincial government's push to make Canada competitive. Government now
recognizes the engine of growth are the small and mid-size companies that
comprise over 95% of all Canadian businesses and provide 80% of all new jobs
in Canada. Many companies are now focusing on export trade. To be successful,
these companies need to identify export opportunities and yet don't have
the time, resources and money to equip themselves with all the tools and
services that would help them capitalize on international market
opportunities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">i) Traditional Language Providers....What's
been missing?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Although there are many small and large commercial
organizations across Canada providing interpretation and translation services,
to date, no Canadian company has attempted to organize a national language
service built on telecommunications technology and rapid response. These
companies provide general document translation services and on-site simultaneous
services. Most interpretation is done in a face-to-face encounter with
interpreters on-site where the interpretation is needed. Rates for professional
services vary according to the skill of the interpreter, but have highs and
lows. They range from a fixed $450 a day for conference interpreting to $60.00
an hour for court interpretation, even though an interpreter may not be used
for the entire time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Most of the translation services provided across
Canada are geared for lengthier documents with a translation turnaround of
12 to 24 hours. Rates vary enormously from province to province and depending
on supply and demand factors in a region, may range anywhere from 15 cents
to 35 cents per word.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The current practice of providing immediate
multilingual services within public-service oriented organizations is often
based on a sporadic, unorganized and unsatisfactory process. Typically, if
there is a requirement for a quick language service, people within the
organization scramble trying to locate someone who has that particular language
skill to assist. When the service is available, community interpreters from
not-for-profit language firms may be used. This, however, takes additional
time and for obvious reasons, cannot be used to provide an immediate response
to a situation. CanTalk's research efforts have shown that telephone language
services are available from a few firms in Canada who provide services with
prearranged conference calls and in a few cases, within a 15 to 20 minute
time frame. All of these services are localized and provide language support
for hospitals, police and other social agencies. They have no sophisticated
delivery or time-sensitive system for rapid language response. Multilingual
staff are being hired, which helps to cover some language needs, but a business
usually cannot cover all language needs for every situation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The realities of Canada's demographics create
social need...<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Immigration is a powerful factor behind the changing
demographics in Canada. Major cities, once principally monolingual, continue
to become multicultural and multilingual. The number of visible minorities
will rise to about 5.7 million in 2001- an increase of over 3.5 times during
the 15 years. In % from 6.3 to 17.7 per cent. With the arrival of large numbers
of people, many now from Asiatic countries who make up Canada's immigrant
populations of 250,000 annually, the need becomes strikingly real. Many cannot
speak English well enough to apply for government services, deal with a utility
company or use the phone when an emergency arises. The ordeal of making a
telephone call may be enough to avoid doing business over the phone. Feeling
intimidated, many may remain on the margins of society for years, never fully
being able to participate. The need for interpreting services is evident
in schools, hospitals, police departments, airline companies... wherever
there is a business or agency that relies on the patronage of Canadians and
where Canadians rely on a business. Moreover, there is clear evidence of
Francophone and Anglo populations have difficulty communicating at a commerce
level across provincial borders and inter-provincially. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Globalization and international
markets.....</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">According to a 1995 Conference Board of Canada
Study, their is a critical need for Canada to increase it share of world
trade and expand its trade portfolio. In 25 of the largest free-market economies
in the world, only 17% speak English as a first language. The fastest growing
economies are found in countries where English is least likely to be spoken
- Indonesia and Mexico. Shifting and potential markets in places like the
Baltic States, Russia, and China offer long term opportunities for trade
but they also have non-native English speaking populations. Overseas trips
are not always affordable for businesses and interpreters on site can be
expensive. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Subsequently, there is a greater need to use the
phone more and travel less. According to language experts, only so much can
happen in English. Mistakes and miscommunication can occur quickly without
skilled interpreters...cultural nuances get missed, essential rapport doesn't
develop. Universal as English may be, it is proven that conducting business
in a native language is still the most effective way to make sure the message
is understood.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Keeping customers in today's marketplace directly implies
understanding and responding to their needs quickly, no matter where they
are located. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">From CanTalk survey of small and mid size businesses,
it was revealed that businesses have few options to access a reliable and
convenient service. Many manage by dealing only in countries where English
is spoken. This limits opportunities for their growth. </FONT> 
  <HR>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">WHAT WE KNOW -THE REALITIES<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Some Facts...<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">A $200,000 language needs survey of Manitoba businesses
and funded by three levels of government ( the first survey of its kind in
North America) showed that the need for language services has been " grossly
underestimated...<I>it's like sitting on oil and we can't drill"</I> says
Susan MacDonald project leader for the one year survey. Once language service
is provided she says, businesses want to keep using them. Out of approximately
400 businesses who returned the survey, 171 wanted a list of interpreters
and translators, and 98 of those "wanted ease of access to affordable
services".<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Nationally, many Canadian organizations and businesses
have no reliable system of providing <I>on demand </I>language services and
it often falls to volunteer organizations. Yet, there is increased recognition
that providing language support opens the door to new business growth. This
is evidenced by the number of major institutions that have hired multilingual
operators or service providers. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">On the global front is the push to become more
competitive. In Canada, not unlike the United States, the engine of growth
are the small and mid size companies that comprise over 95% of all Canadian
businesses and provide 80% of all new jobs in Canada. Many are now being
focused for export trade. However, many don't have the time, resources and
money to find all the tools that will help take advantage of all the
opportunities in the newly emerging international markets. Yet there remains
a constant pressure among all levels of North American business to improve-
do better and with less dollars. Travel less - use the phone more.<I><B>
<BR>
</B></I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">From the same Conference Board of Canada report
report<I> "heavy reliance on traditional markets of the United States, Japan
and the United Kingdom and avoidance of what was once considered Third World
countries with GDP rates of up to 12% will relegate Canadian business to
the slow lane of international commerce".<BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">From a CanTalk survey of small and mid size businesses,
it was revealed that businesses have few options to access a reliable and
convenient language service. For the most part, they were unaware of even
what translation resources might be available. They avoid countries where
English is not spoken or rely on family, friends and staff to assist in their
language needs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Primary competition to CanTalk is AT&amp;T with
a recent aggressive push of their <I>Language Line </I>service into the Canadian
market. Also, <I>Interpretel</I> out of Tucson Arizona with a Canadian shell
that packages a cross section of telecommunication services. They both use
AT&amp;T's U.S. based interpreters and translators in Monterey California.

<P>A relatively young city, only receiving City status as recently as
1925, Stoke-on-Trent is renowned for the design and manufacture of world 
class products. Home to 250,000 people and the world's foremost ceramic 
manufacturers, Stoke-on-Trent is a unique city made up of six separate 
towns - Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton - 
affectionately known as The Potteries.</P>

<P>Resources on and under the very ground of Stoke-on-Trent have shaped its
industrial development - clay, coal and ironstone form the backbone of the
area's economy. The name of Stoke-on-Trent will forever be associated with
world-class ceramic products. Indeed, with names such as Wedgwood, Spode and
Royal Doulton it's not surprising that other local business activities may be
overlooked. This association with ceramics disguises the real depth of the
City's economic character - Michelin, the world's leading tyre manufacturer, is
just one major company which has made Stoke-on-Trent its UK manufacturing
headquarters.</P>

<P>Stoke-on-Trent is mentioned in the Doomsday Book, with references 
to Burslem, Penkhull and Stoke. But the Citys ceramic heritage goes 
back even further with evidence of pottery dating from 2000BC.
The City Museum and Art Gallery is home to the Citys heritage and 
includes the finest collection of Staffordshire ceramics in the world.

<P>Stoke-on-Trent is also known for its famous names, which include Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) the Father of the English Potters who was born in Burslem. A master potter, Wedgwood was a remarkable man of whom the Prime Minister of his times, William Gladstone said "He was the greatest man who ever, in any age or country, applied himself to the important work of unifying art with industry"
</P>
<P>Captain E J Smith (1850-1912) was the distinguished captain of the White Star Line  with his first captaincy at the age of 24. He was Captain of the "unsinkable" SS Titanic  which, on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, struck an iceberg and sank. His last recorded act was to swim to a lifeboat with a child in his arms and his last words were said to be "Be British".</P>
<P>Reginald Mitchell (1895-1937) the designer of the Supermarine Spitfire lived and was educated in the City. His famous airplane can be seen at the City Museum and Art Gallery.</P>
<P>Arnold Bennett (1867-1931) the novelist was born in what is now the City Centre. His  best remembered novels "Anna of the Five Towns" and "The Old Wives Tale" are set in The Potteries of his youth.</P>
<P>Susie Cooper (1902-1995)was the first woman to be honoured as the Royal Designer for Industry in 1940 and was made an OBE for her "contribution to the maintenance of excellence in industrial ceramic design in 1979".</P>
<P>Sir Stanley Matthews ( 1915-) began his football career at Stoke City at the age of 16. He played for England 54 times and was voted Footballer of the Year in 1948 and again - 15 years later! - in 1963. Knighted in 1965, Sir Stan now lives in the City where he started his amazing career.</P>

<P>Stoke-on-Trent enjoys a vibrant local Tourism industry - generating an estimated &#163;75
million each year for the local economy - which attracts over 5 million day
visits a year according to a Heart of England Tourist Board study. The
development of tourism is now placed firmly on the agenda for a sustainable
local economy - underlined by the recent Silver medal awarded to the City in the 1996
Tourism Excellence Awards.</P>

of environmental renewal remains a firm local commitment.</P>

<P>The Stoke-on-Trent National Garden Festival in 1986 and the subsequent
development of the site into Festival Park marked the City's first experience of
the potential of working in partnership. Private and public sector investment
has been rewarded by the creation of 2,700 jobs - probably the most succesful
output from a National Garden Festival in the UK- and the site is now a flourishing
centre of commerce.</P>

<BODY bgcolor="ffffff" background="../images/bkgrd.gif">

<font size=4>

<P>
Motor vehicle accidents and deaths are part of our daily lives, and 1994 wasn't much better in this respect than the year before. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the highway death toll topped 40,000 in 1994 for the second straight year with a two percent increase in motor-vehicle deaths from 1993 to 1994. The following information provides the facts on driving fatalities:

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3a.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Research from the National Safety Council concluded that although <b>motor-vehicle deaths</b> occur more often in collisions between motor vehicles than any other type of accident, this type represents only about 45 percent of the total. Collisions between a motor vehicle and a fixed object were the next most common type, with about 29 percent of the deaths.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3a.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
<b>Passenger cars </b>comprised 74 percent of the registered vehicles and were involved in less than their share of the fatal accidents (59 percent)

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3a.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
<b>Light trucks </b>represent about 20 percent of all motor-vehicle registrations but about 24 percent of vehicles involved in fatal accidents.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3a.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
The Federal Highway Administration reports about half of all motor-vehicle <b>deaths</b> occur during the day and half occur at night. Death rates based on mileage, however, are about 4 times higher at night than during the day.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3a.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Motor-vehicle deaths in 1994 were at their <b>lowest levels </b>in January and February and increased to their highest level in August.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3a.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
More fatal accidents occurred on <b>Friday</b> than any other day of the week in 1994, according to reports from state traffic authorities. For all accidents, Saturday had the highest percentage.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3a.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Of the estimated 175,128,000 licensed drivers in 1994, about 89,000,000 (51 percent) were males and 86,128,000 (49 percent) were females.
Males have a higher involvement rate in fatal accidents - the rate per one billion miles driven was 25 for males and 17 for females.
<b>Exceeding the posted speed limit</b> or driving at an unsafe speed was the most common error in fatal accidents

<TITLE>Trans Union / DATEQ - How Safe are Youthful Drivers? </TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="ffffff" background="../images/bkgrd.gif">

<font size=4>

<P>
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety is an independent,
nonprofit, scientific and educational organization dedicated to
reducing the losses resulting from crashes on the nation's highway.
The following facts are a result of a study they conducted in
1994. These statistics reflect the seriousness of the teenage
motor vehicle crash problem.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
In 1993, <b>5413 teenagers died</b> in the U.S. from motor vehicle
crash injuries.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
The motor vehicle death rate per 100,000 people is especially
high among 16-24 year olds.
The insurance injury claim frequencies and overall collision
losses for cars insured for teenagers to drive are<b> more than double 
</b>those of cars insured for adults.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Eighty-two percent of 16-year-old drivers in fatal crashes
during 1993 made at least one<b> driving error</b> that contributed to
the crashes.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Police reports indicate that 37 percent of all 16-year-old
drivers in fatal crashes during 1993 were reportedly <b>speeding</b>.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Forty-four percent of the 16-year-old drivers were in<b> fatal
crashes </b>that involved only the teen's vehicle.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Only 5 percent of all 16-year-old drivers killed in 1993 accidents
had blood <b>alcohol concentrations</b> of 0.10 or more.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Many of the 16-year-olds who die in crashes aren't using<b> seat
belts</b>.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Two out of every three teens who<b> died as passengers </b>in 1993
crashes were traveling in vehicles driven by other teens.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Insurance injury claim frequencies and overall collision losses
for cars insured for teenagers to drive are<b> more than double</b> those
of cars insured for use by adults only.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Collision <b>losses </b>for teenagers are highest for small and midsize
sports models.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
The vast majority of fatal crashes with a<b> 16 year-old at the
wheel</b> involved a driver leaving the roadway and overturning or
striking a fixed object or overturning on the roadway.

<P>

for Highway Safety at 703.247.1500

<BODY bgcolor="ffffff" background="../images/bkgrd.gif">

<font size=4>

<P>
Research conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration in Washington, D.C. indicates traffic accidents
are the <b>#1 cause of death </b>for youth ages 15-20; their accident
rate is 4 times that of adults; and they make up 7% of the population
yet account for about 14% of vehicle-related deaths.

<P>
In an effort to reduce the number of young people injured
and killed in traffic accidents and to control costs of insuring
youthful drivers, the graduated licensing system is becoming more
and more commonplace. <b>Graduated licensing</b> is a progressive approach
by which 16-year-olds may earn the privilege of unrestricted driving.
A model bill proposed by the National Association of Independent
Insurers (NAII) is being examined by several states. The bill
calls for stricter education and examination procedures, automatic
suspensions for major traffic offenses, zero tolerance for blood
alcohol content, and provisional licenses that limit driving to
the hours of midnight to 6 am.

<P>
Although no states have passed a complete graduated licensing
law, numerous states have enacted<b> elements of the law</b>. Since January
1995, Delaware, Maine and Washington instituted zero alcohol tolerance
for drivers under 21. Iowa, Montana and Rhode Island's law provides
for reduction of the minimum blood alcohol level to .02 for drivers
under 21. North Carolina passed a law with limited license provisions
and zero alcohol tolerance. California and Louisiana made seatbelt
enforcement primary. In addition, Arkansas, Connecticut, Indiana,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Texas, Virginia and Wyoming legislatures have graduated licensing
bills pending.

<P>
The following information is from the 18 states that report to
the U.S. Department of Transportation the blood alcohol concentrations
(BACs) of at least<b> 80 percent of all fatally injured drivers</b>,
the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. The research was conducted in 1994.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Alcohol involvement is <b>highest in nighttime </b>single-vehicle
crashes, in which 66 percent of fatally injured passenger vehicle
drivers in 1994 had BACs of 0.10 percent or more.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
<b>Crashes involving men</b> are much more likely to be alcohol-related
than those involving women. Among fatally injured male drivers
of passenger cars, 42 percent had BACs of 0.10 percent or more
in 1994. The percentage for women was 21.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Traffic fatalities in <b>alcohol-related crashes dropped </b>by 2
percent from 1992 to 1993 and by 26 percent from 1983 to 1993.
In 1983, alcohol-related fatalities accounted for 56 percent of
all traffic deaths.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
More than<b> 1.6 million drivers </b>were arrested in 1992 for driving
under the influence of alcohol or narcotics.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
About<b> 2 in every 5</b> Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related
traffic accident at some time in their lives.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
In 1993,<b> 24.8 percent</b> of all drivers<b> killed</b> in traffic accidents
on <b>weekdays</b> were intoxicated, compared to 44.4 percent on weekends.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
From 1983 to 1993, <b>intoxication rates decreased </b>for drivers
of all age groups. The greatest decrease was for 16-to-20-year-old
drivers. An estimated total of 13,968 lives have been saved by
21-year-old minimum drinking age laws since 1975.

<P>
The safety of a car is defined by the car's &quot;crashworthiness&quot;
<b>Crashworthiness</b> involves rating the most important safety features
that reduce the chances of being killed or seriously injured in
a crash. These features are: vehicle structure, vehicle size,
safety belts, air bags, seating position, side impact protection,
head restraints and infant and child seats.

<h4>Impaired Driving Charges </h4>

The law governing the issue of impaired driving is found within 
both the Federal Criminal Code as well as the Highway Traffic Act 
of each Province.<p>

While a charge of impaired driving is an offence under federal law, 
in most cases there are provincial consequences of this offence which 
come into effect upon conviction.<p>

For example, in Ontario, the consequence of a first conviction is a 
minimum licence suspension of one year concurrent with the three 
months driving prohibition within the federal penalties.<p>

Listed below are the references to the sections of the Federal Criminal 
Code which relate to impaired driving and related offences.  Your local 
library will likely have the most current edition of the Revised 
Statutes of Canada in the Reference Section.  You may obtain a copy
through your local bookstore, or a pocket edition of the Criminal Code 
such as the Pocket Criminal Code printed by Carswell Publishing 
(ISBN 0-459-36211-9).<p>

<h3>Documenting Information</h3>

You may generally assume that the investigating officers have 
collected all the evidence they need.  However, it is wise to 
document everything about the crash at the time it comes to your 
attention.  You think youll remember all the facts, but documentation 
will ensure a good recollection of all details.<p>

In some cases, you will hear that additional witnesses want to 
come forward who have not been interviewed previously by the police.  
If so, refer them to the officer or the Crown who will take their 
statement.<p>

Photographs have probably been taken at the crash scene and perhaps 
at the hospital or the coroners office.  It is possible, however, 
that other pictures would be useful in both the criminal and civil 
cases.  You may be able to take photos of the recovery process of 
the injured victim which investigators cannot because their time 
is limited.  If you take pictures that you think may be helpful, 
have someone witness your taking the photographs.  You and the 
witness should sign and date the photos on the back, and then take 
them to the Crown Attorney.<p>

Ask for the return of any personal effects and/or clothing which 
will not be required as evidence in the court case.<p>

Keep all bills and receipts resulting from the crash.  Begin a 
day-by-day record of all financial expenditures or losses which you 
would not have had if the crash had not happened.<p>


You should keep track of your telephone conversations with anyone 
associated with the case.  Note the date, time and the key subject 
of the conversation for future reference.<p>

<h3>The Crown Attorney</h3>

Once the policing agency has laid charges, the case is referred 
to the crown attorneys office.  This office is usually located 
inside the courthouse where the case will be heard.  Do not hesitate 
to ask the police for the location and telephone number of the 
crown attorneys office.<p>

Phone the crown attorneys office and ask if a crown attorney has 
been assigned to the case.  Please remember that the case is filed 
under the name and date of birth of the accused.
If you are told that a crown has not been assigned to the case, 
ask when it is expected that a crown attorney will be assigned.<p>

If it is getting very close to a court date and you discover that
a crown attorney has not been assigned, ask to speak to the Chief 
Crown Attorney.  Inform the Chief Crown Attorney who you are 
and indicate your concern.<p>

Once a crown attorney is assigned, phone and make an appointment 
with him.  Prepare a list of questions before the meeting to ensure 
you do not forget issues which you want to discuss.  It is important 
during this meeting to make your feelings known about plea 
bargaining, and your interest in submitting a Victim Impact 
Statement to the court.<p>

A recent picture of the victim before the injury or death may be 
taken with you to the crown attorneys office.  As much as possible, 
you will want to reinforce that this crime was committed against 
a person and that your loved one was cared about by many people.  
You can also talk about how things have changed since the crash.<p>

In an effort to be kept informed of any changes in the status of 
the case, you  should:

<ol type=a>
<li>mail a follow-up letter to the crown attorney which outlines 
generally your discussion and your wish to be informed.<p>

<li>inform the investigating officer and the court 
clerk at the courthouse.
</ol>

Many jurisdictions in the country have some type of victim/witness 
programme to which you may be referred.  The purpose of these 
government funded programmes is to prepare a victim or witness 
for the upcoming proceedings.  This may involve a tour of a 
typical courtroom and orientation to the trial process.<p>

<h3>Plea Bargaining</h3>

This term refers to negotiations which take place between the 
crown attorney and the defense lawyer.  These negotiations may 
result in a guilty plea to a lesser charge or a guilty plea in 
exchange for a reduced sentence.  These bargains seem distasteful 
to victim families who feel that to cut a deal is to diminish 
the significance of the crime.  Crown attorneys and judges are 
eager to execute plea bargains because they do not have the time 
nor resources to take every case to trial.<p>


MADD Canada does not support plea bargaining and believes that 
all cases of the accused pleading not guilty should go to trial 
unless it is obvious that there is insufficient evidence to win 
a conviction.<p>

<h3>Going to Trial</h3>

If the defendant persists in pleading not guilty, the case will 
be set for trial.  He has a right to choose whether he wants 
his case to be decided by a judge alone or by a judge and jury.  
Be prepared for more delays after a trial date has been set.<p>

If the defendant chooses a jury trial, jury selection may take some 
time.  Most injured victims and surviving families want to attend 
the trial although they know it will be an emotionally draining 
experience.<p>

You may be surprised to learn that the defense may try to prevent
you from attending the trial.  The defense lawyers goal is to 
minimize the victim sympathy factor during the trial.  The defense 
wants any sympathy to be focused on the defendant and not the victim.<p>

Typically, the defense lawyer will request a publication ban on 
the evidence presented in the trial and on the name of the accused.  
Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that very few 
publication bans are indeed necessary in order to protect the 
rights of those involved.  This may lead to a more open court 
process in all cases.<p>

<h3>Courtroom Guidelines</h3>

Do not discuss the case in the halls or restrooms.  Your behaviour 
out of the courtroom is as important as your behaviour in it.  You 
should remind any supporters who will be attending the proceedings 
that any disruption may result in a clearing of the courtroom of 
any spectators including the victim family as well as the 
possibility of a mistrial.<p>

Never speak to the judge or a juror - even if you encounter them 
in the hall or at lunch.  They must remain bias-free as they hear 
the evidence.<p>

Be prepared for the emotional impact of hearing the defendant 
say not guilty.  Even though you know there would not be a trial 
unless he was pleading not guilty, many victims report a jarring 
emotional response when they actually hear the words.  In many 
cases, these are the first words the victim or the victim family 
has heard the defendant speak.<p>

Expect to hear upsetting testimony.  You may hear gruesome details 
for the first time.  You may see photos you have never been shown 
before.  You may also hear the defense lawyer attempt to show that 
you or your loved one were responsible for the crash.  He has an 
ethical responsibility to do all he can to represent his clients 
legal interests.  Therefore, much of what is so important to you 
may seem like gamesmanship of players who try to outskill each 
other in courtroom drama.  It is up to the judge or jury to 
determine the truth.<p>

If you feel you may lose control of your emotions during the trial, 
leave the courtroom.  Your presence or demeanor in the courtroom 
must not be intended to influence the judge or jury.<p>

If you have questions or concerns during the trial, write them 
down and give them to the crown attorney or victim advocate.<p>

Remember throughout the trial process that the burden of proof 
in the case is the responsibility of the crown and that the 
defense need only create an element of doubt for the case to be lost.

<h3>The Verdict</h3>

Hearing the announcement of the verdict is the climax of the 
trial and usually a very emotional time for the victim and/or 
victim family.  You must be aware that a legal verdict and the 
truth are, unfortunately, not always the same thing.  While a 
defendant may not, in truth, be innocent, he may be proven not 
guilty.<p>  
Judges and juries are the best way our society knows 
to determine legal justice.  Judges and juries are also 
susceptible to human error.  All of this must be kept in 
perspective.  The standard of proof in criminal cases is beyond 
a reasonable doubt, the highest burden of proof required in any 
trial proceeding.  If any doubt based on reason exists as to any 
element of the offense as charged, the verdict of the judge and/or 
judge and jury must be not guilty. Evidence must establish the 
facts so clearly, positively, and explicitly that there can be 
no reasonable doubt that the case was proven.<p>

<h3>Young Offenders Act</h3>

Young people under the age of 18 years of age accused of offences 
contrary to any law are subject to the provision of the Young 
Offenders Act.  This law was intended to provide young people 
with an opportunity to avoid the stigma of a criminal record 
for minor transgressions which could occur due to inexperience 
or a momentary lack of judgment.<p>

This Act has become the source of controversy because of a 
tremendous increase in youth crime, recitivism and in particular, 
the increase in the frequency of violent crimes such as impaired 
driving committed by those under 18 years of age.<p>

If the accused is a young offender, you as the victim have to 
request access to any records on the specific crime for which 
he is accused.  Section 44.1 (5) states in part, "Any record 
that is kept ... may, on request, be made available for 
inspection to the victim of the offence to which the record relates."<p>

Sentencing,  relating to impaired driving cases,  has caused 
many victims to feel that the young person has not been held 
truly accountable for their behaviour especially when the young 
person has accepted an adult responsibility such as driving.<p>

In some cases, victims feel that they understand the need for 
the young offender to
have future opportunities which could be limited through 
extended incarceration, but also feel that the death or injury 
of their loved one should not be minimized.  In these 
circumstances, some victims advocate for the judge to impose 
a significant period of licence revocation in addition to a 
community service order for the young offender.

<h3>What Can You Do? </h3>

<h3>The Crash Report</h3>

The crash report, or accident report as it is sometimes called, 
is prepared by the law enforcement agency which investigated the 
crash.  It is usually the municipal police service if the crash 
occurred within the city limits.  In other areas, the 
investigation and reporting may be done by the Provincial Police 
or the R.C.M.P.<p>

In most circumstances, you may obtain a copy of the report 
through the investigating officer who is assigned to the case.  
The investigating officer will often ensure that any nominal 
fee which may usually be charged for the document preparation 
is waived.  If a fee is charged, keep the receipt in case you 
may be reimbursed at a later date.<p>

If you are having difficulty obtaining a copy of the report, 
call the appropriate agency, give the date and location of the 
crash, and ask how and when you may obtain copies of the initial 
report and any supplementary reports.<p>

Sometimes the investigating officer will give you a reference 
number of the report at the scene, at the hospital, or at the 
death notification.<p>

Make note of  the officer's name, as well as the police agency 
affiliation and telephone number.  <p>

Ask as many questions as you require in order to get the 
information that you need.  At a time such as this, there are 
no stupid questions.<p>

When you get the report, which is considered public information 
under the Freedom of Information Act, look it over closely 
for the following data:

<ul>
<li>Do you see any errors or omissions in the report?  If so, 
report them immediately to the investigating officer whose name 
appears on the report.  Even if they seem minor, they can be 
crucial to court cases.  
<li>Are there any indications on the report that the accused 
had been drinking or using other drugs?  If so, see if a Blood 
Alcohol Content (B.A.C.) level is indicated.  B.A.C. is usually 
determined by breath or blood testing shortly after the crime 
was committed.  If the tests were not performed, you should ask why they were not.
Tests should be given following crashes in which alcohol or other 
drug use is suspected.  All too often, however, testing is not done 
or procedures are not followed properly.<p>
</ul>

<h3>Victim Impact Statements</h3>

The Criminal Code of Canada (S. 735) provides that victims 
may submit a written statement to the court about the impact 
of the crime on their lives.  These statements are used in the 
sentencing phase of the proceedings.<p>

Each province provides a format to be followed for the submission 
of these statements to the court.  Ask the crown attorney, court 
clerk or the MADD Canada National Office for this information.<p>

In preparing statements, be sure your information is accurate.  
Write from the heart about your pain, but do not make bitter or 
negative remarks about the offender.  The judgment of the 
defendant belongs to the court.<p>

We have enclosed a sample of a Victim Impact Statement to help you.  
Your local Chapter of MADD Canada can assist you in preparing 
your statement and give you additional samples which have been written.<p>

<h3>Sample Victim Impact Statement</h3>

<dl>
<dd>Your Honour,<p>

It has been 18 months since Debbie was killed, but to us it seems 
like it was just yesterday.  Our lives started new and we were 
filled with pain from that day on.  For each day that we have to 
live without her we feel cheated, never being able to touch her, 
see her, hear her talk or laugh.  Debbie was the spark in our 
small family of three.  She loved life and people, had many 
interests, found excitement in almost everything she did, and 
loved to share it with us.<p>

There is so much that I would like to tell you about Debbie: how 
she loved music, loved to sing and dance, volunteered at the 
seniors home, how she loved to watch football with her 
father, was fascinated with magic tricks and loved animals.  
She hoped to be a vet some day to care for little furry creatures.  
She always brought home a stray cat or dog and made sure that 
the owner was found.<p>

Flashbacks from the crash fill my thoughts each night.  She did 
not have a chance.  Her life contrasted her death in so many 
ways.  No ones life should end that way.<p>

The day we buried our Deb, the sun was shining and the sky was 
clear.  The air, however, was crisp and the wind ruffled through 
the flowers laying on her casket. <p> 

We loved Debbie so much and saw she had a bright future.  She 
would have been 17 years old today.  I hope and pray that no 
other family suffers this type of loss although I know it is 
all too common.<p>

Our family wants justice and for a strong message to be sent to 
those who would even consider getting behind the wheel of their 
cars after drinking.<p>
	
Sincerely,<p>
Mark & Dianne Webster.
</dl>

<h3>Questions & Answers</h3>

<b>Will I need a lawyer?</b><p>

For the criminal proceedings, the crown attorney is the lawyer 
who will prepare the case.  It is wise, however, to consult a 
lawyer regarding matters such as insurance claims, estates and 
if personal injuries were involved.  A consultation with a 
lawyer is usually free.  Call the law society in your telephone 
book for referrals to lawyers in your area.<p>


<b>Can the drinking establishment be held liable?</b><p>

The drinking establishment may he held responsible in a civil 
case for serving the driver to the point of intoxication.  Both 
financial judgments and revocation of their permit to serve 
alcoholic beverages can result from irresponsible service.<p>


<b>I understand that the maximum sentence for impaired driving 
causing death is 14 years in prison, but what can we expect to happen?</b><p>

In the early 1980s, it was common for an impaired driver 
convicted of killing someone to receive a $50. fine and a 
3 month licence suspension.<p>

In 1995, the typical sentence for this offence may range from 
2 - 3 years.  An offender serves a fraction of this sentence 
before beginning parole.<p>

Exceptional cases have resulted in higher sentences as the 
judges become more aware of the violent nature of this crime 
and the number of repeat offenders who eventually kill.<p>


<b>Is there any cost for MADD Canada services for victims?</b><p>

All of our victim services are organized by volunteers who 
donate their time to help.  Many of these volunteers have 
lost a loved one due to impaired driving and they want to 
help others.  In addition, information and referral services 
are provided at no cost.<p>


<b>Can someone from MADD Canada come to court with me?</b><p>

In many cases a volunteer will be available to accompany you 
to court to provide support and information.<p>


<b>Do I have to be a mother to be involved?</b><p>

MADD Canada involves the combined efforts of men and women 
of all ages who want to eliminate impaired driving and to help 
victims of this violent crime. All of our victim services are 
open equally to everyone.  <p>

If you are involved in any legal proceeding,  you will probably hear 
terms you are not familiar with.  Feel free to ask your lawyer or 
community legal worker the meaning of these terms.  Following, however,

procedure for conviction is strict and relatively complex, to 
protect the rights of the accused.<p>

<li><b>INFORMATION:</b> A written accusation that you have

obey specific conditions of parole or he/she will be sent 
back to prison.<p>

<li><b>PLEA BARGAINING:</b> Negotiations between the defense 
counsel and the Crown attorney concerning the charges against 
the accused, and the pleas of the accused. The Crown may accept 
a guilty plea on a lesser charge instead of incurring the expense 
and problems of a trial on the original charge.<p>

<li><b>PRE-SENTENCE REPORT:</b> A description of the accusers 
family life and personal situation, prepared by a probation 
officer which the judge uses to help in deciding an

permission for the accused to be released on bail, subject to 
the conditions specified on the appropriate form.<p>

<li><b>REGULATION:</b> Legal rules made under the authority of 
a statute by the Cabinet, but not requiring the approval of 
Parliament.  Regulations usually deal with relatively minor
matters, leaving the major aspects of a law to the statute.<p>

<li><b>SUMMARY OFFENCES:</b> Less serious criminal offences 
and offences against provincial laws (i.e. highway offences). 
The procedure for conviction on a summary offence is less 
complicated than for the more serious indictable offences. 
Possible maximum punishment of six months in jail and/or a 
$2,000 fine.<p>

spend time in jail.<p>

<li><b>TESTIMONY:</b> Statements made in court by the witness

how young people will be treated if they are suspected of having

<a name="What is MADD"><h3>What is MADD Canada?</h3>
MADD Canada is a national network of concerned citizens committed
to stopping the crime of impaired driving. Based on the success
of Mothers Against Drunk Driving in the United States, 
MADD Canada is working to heighten awareness about the dangers
of impaired driving, offer aid and counseling to its victims, 
and save lives.<p>

<a name="Problem"><h3>Is driving under the influence a big problem 
in Canada?</h3>
<b>Definitely.</b> The impaired driving problem is as bad as ever -
or worse. In fact, it's the single largest criminal cause of death 
in our country. To put it in perspective: in 1992, there were 732 
homicides in Canada. By contrast,  there are about 2,500 fatalities
resulting from impaired driving each year. The death rate from
impaired driving is thus <i>three to four times the national
murder rate.</i> It is a crime of epidemic proportions.<p>

<a name="Crime"><h3>Is impaired driving a crime?</h3>
<b>Yes.</b> And if you have any doubts about the seriousness
of this criminal act, think about this: a first-time impaired 
driving offense is punishable in Canada by up to five years
in prison. If the impaired driver is found guilty of causing
bodily harm or death, he can be punished by serving ten
or more years behind bars. But for every impaired driver
who is arrested and charged, there are countless more
who get away with their crime.<p>

<a name="What"><h3>What is MADD Canada doing about drinking and 
driving?</h3>
MADD Canada is working to prevent impaired driving and help its
victims through:
<ul>
<li><b>Legislative Initiatives.</b> Tougher laws do discourage those
who might drink and drive; and fewer impaired drivers on the
road translates to fewer crashes and more saved lives.
<li><b>Teenage Outreach.</b> Young people are still involved in a 
tragically high number of impaired driving crashes. MADD Canada
is working to reduce this toll by educating our young people
and spreading the message about the dangers of impaired
driving.
<li><b>Public Awareness Campaigns.</b> Many people do not understand 
how dangerous it is to drink and drive. They also may not realize
how much they can do to help eliminate the problem. We're helping
more people understand that even one drink can impair a person's
ability to driver safely.
<li><b>Victim Assistance Programs.</b> MADD Canada offers support to
victims and their families during the grieving and healing process.
We also help them understand how the justice system works and 
what their rights are.
</ul><p>

<img align=right src=images/100000.gif>

<a name="Specific"><h3>What specific legislation doex MADD Canada
support that would help eliminate the impaired driving problem</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>National Minimum Legal Drinking Age.</b> Achieving a national
minimum drinking age of 21 in canada is one of our first
reform goals. Underage impaired driving deaths dropped 
over 40% in the U.S. when the drinking age was raised to
21. When this minimum drinking age legislation is 
implemented, it will begin saving lives almost immediately.
<li><b>Administrative Licence Suspension (ALS).</b> This measure gives
police officers the authority to confiscate and impaired driver's
licencd at the time of arrest, thereby preventing him from
committing more impaired driving crimes before his case is
heatd in court. ALS will reduce this threat on our highways.
<li><b>The Graduated Driver's Licence System.</b> Under consideration
in several provinces, this process allows new drivers to eatn
their licences gradually, as they prove that they have the
skills and maturity to  be responsible drivers.
</ul>
Call or write to your provincial and federal legislators. Tell them
that you support tougher laws to stop deaths and injuries
resulting from impaired driving.<p>

<a name="Young people"><h3>What is MADD Canada doing to prevent
young people from drinking and driving?</h3>
MADD Canada goes where teenagers are-the schools. Our
"Close to Home" presentation, teaches high school students
about the dangers of driving while impaired by alcohol and
other drugs. "Close to Home" hers MADD Canada's message
across in a multi-media format that combines video and rock
music with victim presenters who till their stories.<p>


<a name="Response"><h3>Are people responding to MADD Canada's
public awareness campaign?</h3>
Yes, through these and other programs:
<ul>
<li><b>Project Red Ribbon</b> gives a different, safer meaning to the phrase
"tie one on." Supporters display the ribbons on car antennas,
mirrors, and door handles. Originally intended as a reminder
to drive safe and sober during the holiday season, red ribbons
are now displayed throughout the year.
<li><b>Candlelight Vigils</b> bring together victims of impaired driving
crashes to share their grief and comfort each other. The
Candlelight Vigils are also a visible reminder to everyone
that drimking and driving must stop. Many MADD Canada
chapters hold such candlelight vigils each December.<p>
</ul>

<a name="Victims"><h3>I know that some victims of impaired driving
crashes suffer terrible emotional trauma. What is MADD Canada doing
to help them?</h3>
A big part of MADD Canada's mission is to help and
support victins of impaired driving crimes. We help
victims and their families in a number of ways:
<ul>
<li><b>Support Services:</b> MADD Canada provides telephone
support and information to assist victims.
<li><b>Understanding the Legal System:</b> We provide information
about the judicial process and clarify victims'
rights. MADD Canada chapter members accompany
victims to court and follow up with them on the
sentencing of the offender.
<li><b>Victim Impact Statements:</b> Prepared by victims or their
surviving family members with the help of MADDD
Canada, these statements explain how the crime of 
impaired driving has shattered their lives. Victim
Impact Statements can lead to tougher sentencing
of offenders.<p>
</ul>

<img align=right src=images/between.gif>

<a name="Risk"><h3>I don't drink and drive. Am I still at risk</h3>
<b>Yes.</b> Impaired drivers can strike anyone at any time, like a stray
bullet hurtling along our nation's roadways. As long as there are
impaired drivers on our roads, no one is ever completely safe
from this crime.<p>

<a name="Help"><h3>Is there anything I can do to help?</h3>
<b>Yes.</b> There are several ways you can support MADD Canada's
fight against drinking and driving:
<ul>
<li>Support tougher legislation for impaired driving offenders.
<li>Don't serve alcohol to minors.
<li>Volunteer to help your local MADD Canada chapter.
<li>And please - <i>never</i> drink and drive.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Impaired Driving Charges </h4>

The law governing the issue of impaired driving is found within 
both the Federal Criminal Code as well as the Highway Traffic Act 
of each Province.<p>

While a charge of impaired driving is an offence under federal law, 
in most cases there are provincial consequences of this offence which 
come into effect upon conviction.<p>

For example, in Ontario, the consequence of a first conviction is a 
minimum licence suspension of one year concurrent with the three 
months driving prohibition within the federal penalties.<p>

Listed below are the references to the sections of the Federal Criminal 
Code which relate to impaired driving and related offences.  Your local 
library will likely have the most current edition of the Revised 
Statutes of Canada in the Reference Section.  You may obtain a copy
through your local bookstore, or a pocket edition of the Criminal Code 
such as the Pocket Criminal Code printed by Carswell Publishing 
(ISBN 0-459-36211-9).<p>

<h3>Federal Criminal Code</h3>

</ol>

<h3>Documenting Information</h3>

You may generally assume that the investigating officers have 
collected all the evidence they need.  However, it is wise to 
document everything about the crash at the time it comes to your 
attention.  You think youll remember all the facts, but documentation 
will ensure a good recollection of all details.<p>

In some cases, you will hear that additional witnesses want to 
come forward who have not been interviewed previously by the police.  
If so, refer them to the officer or the Crown who will take their 
statement.<p>

Photographs have probably been taken at the crash scene and perhaps 
at the hospital or the coroners office.  It is possible, however, 
that other pictures would be useful in both the criminal and civil 
cases.  You may be able to take photos of the recovery process of 
the injured victim which investigators cannot because their time 
is limited.  If you take pictures that you think may be helpful, 
have someone witness your taking the photographs.  You and the 
witness should sign and date the photos on the back, and then take 
them to the Crown Attorney.<p>

Ask for the return of any personal effects and/or clothing which 
will not be required as evidence in the court case.<p>

Keep all bills and receipts resulting from the crash.  Begin a 
day-by-day record of all financial expenditures or losses which you 
would not have had if the crash had not happened.<p>


You should keep track of your telephone conversations with anyone 
associated with the case.  Note the date, time and the key subject 
of the conversation for future reference.<p>

<h3>The Crown Attorney</h3>

Once the policing agency has laid charges, the case is referred 
to the crown attorneys office.  This office is usually located 
inside the courthouse where the case will be heard.  Do not hesitate 
to ask the police for the location and telephone number of the 
crown attorneys office.<p>

Phone the crown attorneys office and ask if a crown attorney has 
been assigned to the case.  Please remember that the case is filed 
under the name and date of birth of the accused.
If you are told that a crown has not been assigned to the case, 
ask when it is expected that a crown attorney will be assigned.<p>

If it is getting very close to a court date and you discover that
a crown attorney has not been assigned, ask to speak to the Chief 
Crown Attorney.  Inform the Chief Crown Attorney who you are 
and indicate your concern.<p>

Once a crown attorney is assigned, phone and make an appointment 
with him.  Prepare a list of questions before the meeting to ensure 
you do not forget issues which you want to discuss.  It is important 
during this meeting to make your feelings known about plea 
bargaining, and your interest in submitting a Victim Impact 
Statement to the court.<p>

A recent picture of the victim before the injury or death may be 
taken with you to the crown attorneys office.  As much as possible, 
you will want to reinforce that this crime was committed against 
a person and that your loved one was cared about by many people.  
You can also talk about how things have changed since the crash.<p>

In an effort to be kept informed of any changes in the status of 
the case, you  should:

<ol type=a>
<li>mail a follow-up letter to the crown attorney which outlines 
generally your discussion and your wish to be informed.<p>

<li>inform the investigating officer and the court 
clerk at the courthouse.
</ol>

Many jurisdictions in the country have some type of victim/witness 
programme to which you may be referred.  The purpose of these 
government funded programmes is to prepare a victim or witness 
for the upcoming proceedings.  This may involve a tour of a 
typical courtroom and orientation to the trial process.<p>

<h3>Plea Bargaining</h3>

This term refers to negotiations which take place between the 
crown attorney and the defense lawyer.  These negotiations may 
result in a guilty plea to a lesser charge or a guilty plea in 
exchange for a reduced sentence.  These bargains seem distasteful 
to victim families who feel that to cut a deal is to diminish 
the significance of the crime.  Crown attorneys and judges are 
eager to execute plea bargains because they do not have the time 
nor resources to take every case to trial.<p>


MADD Canada does not support plea bargaining and believes that 
all cases of the accused pleading not guilty should go to trial 
unless it is obvious that there is insufficient evidence to win 
a conviction.<p>

<h3>Going to Trial</h3>

If the defendant persists in pleading not guilty, the case will 
be set for trial.  He has a right to choose whether he wants 
his case to be decided by a judge alone or by a judge and jury.  
Be prepared for more delays after a trial date has been set.<p>

If the defendant chooses a jury trial, jury selection may take some 
time.  Most injured victims and surviving families want to attend 
the trial although they know it will be an emotionally draining 
experience.<p>

You may be surprised to learn that the defense may try to prevent
you from attending the trial.  The defense lawyers goal is to 
minimize the victim sympathy factor during the trial.  The defense 
wants any sympathy to be focused on the defendant and not the victim.<p>

Typically, the defense lawyer will request a publication ban on 
the evidence presented in the trial and on the name of the accused.  
Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that very few 
publication bans are indeed necessary in order to protect the 
rights of those involved.  This may lead to a more open court 
process in all cases.<p>

<h3>Courtroom Guidelines</h3>

Do not discuss the case in the halls or restrooms.  Your behaviour 
out of the courtroom is as important as your behaviour in it.  You 
should remind any supporters who will be attending the proceedings 
that any disruption may result in a clearing of the courtroom of 
any spectators including the victim family as well as the 
possibility of a mistrial.<p>

Never speak to the judge or a juror - even if you encounter them 
in the hall or at lunch.  They must remain bias-free as they hear 
the evidence.<p>

Be prepared for the emotional impact of hearing the defendant 
say not guilty.  Even though you know there would not be a trial 
unless he was pleading not guilty, many victims report a jarring 
emotional response when they actually hear the words.  In many 
cases, these are the first words the victim or the victim family 
has heard the defendant speak.<p>

Expect to hear upsetting testimony.  You may hear gruesome details 
for the first time.  You may see photos you have never been shown 
before.  You may also hear the defense lawyer attempt to show that 
you or your loved one were responsible for the crash.  He has an 
ethical responsibility to do all he can to represent his clients 
legal interests.  Therefore, much of what is so important to you 
may seem like gamesmanship of players who try to outskill each 
other in courtroom drama.  It is up to the judge or jury to 
determine the truth.<p>

If you feel you may lose control of your emotions during the trial, 
leave the courtroom.  Your presence or demeanor in the courtroom 
must not be intended to influence the judge or jury.<p>

If you have questions or concerns during the trial, write them 
down and give them to the crown attorney or victim advocate.<p>

Remember throughout the trial process that the burden of proof 
in the case is the responsibility of the crown and that the 
defense need only create an element of doubt for the case to be lost.

<h3>The Verdict</h3>

Hearing the announcement of the verdict is the climax of the 
trial and usually a very emotional time for the victim and/or 
victim family.  You must be aware that a legal verdict and the 
truth are, unfortunately, not always the same thing.  While a 
defendant may not, in truth, be innocent, he may be proven not 
guilty.<p>  
Judges and juries are the best way our society knows 
to determine legal justice.  Judges and juries are also 
susceptible to human error.  All of this must be kept in 
perspective.  The standard of proof in criminal cases is beyond 
a reasonable doubt, the highest burden of proof required in any 
trial proceeding.  If any doubt based on reason exists as to any 
element of the offense as charged, the verdict of the judge and/or 
judge and jury must be not guilty. Evidence must establish the 
facts so clearly, positively, and explicitly that there can be 
no reasonable doubt that the case was proven.<p>

<h3>Young Offenders Act</h3>

Young people under the age of 18 years of age accused of offences 
contrary to any law are subject to the provision of the Young 
Offenders Act.  This law was intended to provide young people 
with an opportunity to avoid the stigma of a criminal record 
for minor transgressions which could occur due to inexperience 
or a momentary lack of judgment.<p>

This Act has become the source of controversy because of a 
tremendous increase in youth crime, recitivism and in particular, 
the increase in the frequency of violent crimes such as impaired 
driving committed by those under 18 years of age.<p>

If the accused is a young offender, you as the victim have to 
request access to any records on the specific crime for which 
he is accused.  Section 44.1 (5) states in part, "Any record 
that is kept ... may, on request, be made available for 
inspection to the victim of the offence to which the record relates."<p>

Sentencing,  relating to impaired driving cases,  has caused 
many victims to feel that the young person has not been held 
truly accountable for their behaviour especially when the young 
person has accepted an adult responsibility such as driving.<p>

In some cases, victims feel that they understand the need for 
the young offender to
have future opportunities which could be limited through 
extended incarceration, but also feel that the death or injury 
of their loved one should not be minimized.  In these 
circumstances, some victims advocate for the judge to impose 
a significant period of licence revocation in addition to a 
community service order for the young offender.

<h3>What Can You Do? </h3>

<h3>The Crash Report</h3>

The crash report, or accident report as it is sometimes called, 
is prepared by the law enforcement agency which investigated the 
crash.  It is usually the municipal police service if the crash 
occurred within the city limits.  In other areas, the 
investigation and reporting may be done by the Provincial Police 
or the R.C.M.P.<p>

In most circumstances, you may obtain a copy of the report 
through the investigating officer who is assigned to the case.  
The investigating officer will often ensure that any nominal 
fee which may usually be charged for the document preparation 
is waived.  If a fee is charged, keep the receipt in case you 
may be reimbursed at a later date.<p>

If you are having difficulty obtaining a copy of the report, 
call the appropriate agency, give the date and location of the 
crash, and ask how and when you may obtain copies of the initial 
report and any supplementary reports.<p>

Sometimes the investigating officer will give you a reference 
number of the report at the scene, at the hospital, or at the 
death notification.<p>

Make note of  the officer's name, as well as the police agency 
affiliation and telephone number.  <p>

Ask as many questions as you require in order to get the 
information that you need.  At a time such as this, there are 
no stupid questions.<p>

When you get the report, which is considered public information 
under the Freedom of Information Act, look it over closely 
for the following data:

<ul>
<li>Do you see any errors or omissions in the report?  If so, 
report them immediately to the investigating officer whose name 
appears on the report.  Even if they seem minor, they can be 
crucial to court cases.  
<li>Are there any indications on the report that the accused 
had been drinking or using other drugs?  If so, see if a Blood 
Alcohol Content (B.A.C.) level is indicated.  B.A.C. is usually 
determined by breath or blood testing shortly after the crime 
was committed.  If the tests were not performed, you should ask why they were not.
Tests should be given following crashes in which alcohol or other 
drug use is suspected.  All too often, however, testing is not done 
or procedures are not followed properly.<p>
</ul>

<h3>Victim Impact Statements</h3>

The Criminal Code of Canada (S. 735) provides that victims 
may submit a written statement to the court about the impact 
of the crime on their lives.  These statements are used in the 
sentencing phase of the proceedings.<p>

Each province provides a format to be followed for the submission 
of these statements to the court.  Ask the crown attorney, court 
clerk or the MADD Canada National Office for this information.<p>

In preparing statements, be sure your information is accurate.  
Write from the heart about your pain, but do not make bitter or 
negative remarks about the offender.  The judgment of the 
defendant belongs to the court.<p>

We have enclosed a sample of a Victim Impact Statement to help you.  
Your local Chapter of MADD Canada can assist you in preparing 
your statement and give you additional samples which have been written.<p>

<h3>Sample Victim Impact Statement</h3>

<dl>
<dd>Your Honour,<p>

It has been 18 months since Debbie was killed, but to us it seems 
like it was just yesterday.  Our lives started new and we were 
filled with pain from that day on.  For each day that we have to 
live without her we feel cheated, never being able to touch her, 
see her, hear her talk or laugh.  Debbie was the spark in our 
small family of three.  She loved life and people, had many 
interests, found excitement in almost everything she did, and 
loved to share it with us.<p>

There is so much that I would like to tell you about Debbie: how 
she loved music, loved to sing and dance, volunteered at the 
seniors home, how she loved to watch football with her 
father, was fascinated with magic tricks and loved animals.  
She hoped to be a vet some day to care for little furry creatures.  
She always brought home a stray cat or dog and made sure that 
the owner was found.<p>

Flashbacks from the crash fill my thoughts each night.  She did 
not have a chance.  Her life contrasted her death in so many 
ways.  No ones life should end that way.<p>

The day we buried our Deb, the sun was shining and the sky was 
clear.  The air, however, was crisp and the wind ruffled through 
the flowers laying on her casket. <p> 

We loved Debbie so much and saw she had a bright future.  She 
would have been 17 years old today.  I hope and pray that no 
other family suffers this type of loss although I know it is 
all too common.<p>

Our family wants justice and for a strong message to be sent to 
those who would even consider getting behind the wheel of their 
cars after drinking.<p>
	
Sincerely,<p>
Mark & Dianne Webster.
</dl>

<h3>Questions & Answers</h3>

<b>Will I need a lawyer?</b><p>

For the criminal proceedings, the crown attorney is the lawyer 
who will prepare the case.  It is wise, however, to consult a 
lawyer regarding matters such as insurance claims, estates and 
if personal injuries were involved.  A consultation with a 
lawyer is usually free.  Call the law society in your telephone 
book for referrals to lawyers in your area.<p>


<b>Can the drinking establishment be held liable?</b><p>

The drinking establishment may he held responsible in a civil 
case for serving the driver to the point of intoxication.  Both 
financial judgments and revocation of their permit to serve 
alcoholic beverages can result from irresponsible service.<p>


<b>I understand that the maximum sentence for impaired driving 
causing death is 14 years in prison, but what can we expect to happen?</b><p>

In the early 1980s, it was common for an impaired driver 
convicted of killing someone to receive a $50. fine and a 
3 month licence suspension.<p>

In 1995, the typical sentence for this offence may range from 
2 - 3 years.  An offender serves a fraction of this sentence 
before beginning parole.<p>

Exceptional cases have resulted in higher sentences as the 
judges become more aware of the violent nature of this crime 
and the number of repeat offenders who eventually kill.<p>


<b>Is there any cost for MADD Canada services for victims?</b><p>

All of our victim services are organized by volunteers who 
donate their time to help.  Many of these volunteers have 
lost a loved one due to impaired driving and they want to 
help others.  In addition, information and referral services 
are provided at no cost.<p>


<b>Can someone from MADD Canada come to court with me?</b><p>

In many cases a volunteer will be available to accompany you 
to court to provide support and information.<p>


<b>Do I have to be a mother to be involved?</b><p>

MADD Canada involves the combined efforts of men and women 
of all ages who want to eliminate impaired driving and to help 
victims of this violent crime. All of our victim services are 
open equally to everyone.  <p>

<P><I><font color="#9F121B"><B>A Guide to Alternative Medicine</I></B></FONT>, an Isis Interactive Library CD-ROM, provides the opportunity to explore the fascinating and rapidly growing world of Alternative Medicine. It is estimated that Alternative Medicine is a $14 billion industry in the U.S. alone.  It is also reliably estimated that fully one-third of the U.S. population has explored alternatives to mainstream medicine for both prevention and therapy.  "Alternative Medicine" is mainstream medicine for more than 80 percent of the world's population.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Thirty-four of the country's 125 medical schools -- including Harvard, Yale and Johns Hopkins -- now offer courses in alternative medicine.  In 1995, the American Medical Association passed a resolution suggesting that its 300,000 members "become better informed regarding the practices and techniques of alternative or unconventional medicine."  Many of the U.S.'s leading news magazines -- including <U>Time</U>, <U>Newsweek</U>  and <U>Life</U> -- have recently devoted cover stories to various alternative medical treatments.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>In 1991, the U.S. Congress established the Office of Alternative Medicine within the National Institutes of Health.  The first Director of the Office was Dr. Joseph J. Jacobs, a respected and experienced mainstream physician whose Mohawk Indian heritage exposed him early in his life to treatments practiced historically among the Mohawk Indians.  Dr. Jacobs brings a physician's dedication to scientific methods, skepticism of the unproven, but an open attitude to treatments that are not yet considered mainstream therapies.</P>  

<P ALIGN=LEFT> Dr. Jacobs leads the  user through seven alternative medical topics: </P>

<UL><ALIGN=LEFT>
 
<LI>Mind-Body interventions
 
<LI>Botanical Medicine

<LI>Pharmacological and Biological treatments

<LI>Manual healing methods

<LI>Bioelectromagnetics

<LI>Vitamins and Minerals

<LI>Traditional Alternative Systems 
</UL>

<P>Each topic is packed with information, easily accessible to the user in a variety of forms:</P>
<UL><ALIGN=LEFT>
<LI>Video segments with experts in their fields
<LI>Concise audio and written explanations of the topic
<LI>A direct link to the NIH report <U>Expanding Medical Horizons</U>, offering hundreds of pages of authoritative information and documentation
</UL>

<P>The user can develop his or her own "notebook" of information of individual interest.  For example, if you are concerned about asthma, you can record information from various therapies and assemble it all together in your own notebook about alternative medical treatments available for asthma--and then Print the notebook.</P>
<P>The disc also has a print function that will allow you to capture and print any information that the user may believe will be helpful.</P>
<P>The Disc Index permits the user to search by topic and to go directly to the topic of immediate interest.  There is also a Glossary accessible at all times.</P>
<P>And to keep current with developments, the disc permits you to click directly onto the Isis medical site on the Internet, where you will find information updates and links to other sites that offer extensive information on Alternative Medicine.</P>
<P><I><B><FONT COLOR=#9F121B">A Guide to Alternative Medicine</I></B></FONT> is the most thorough and extensive work yet published on this topic in the CD-ROM format.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The market for vitamins, minerals, and supplements is enormous.  It is estimated that the yearly expenditure in the U.S. is over $13 per person ($4.2 billion), followed closely by Germany, France, and Great Britain.  The success of vitamins and supplements has stemmed from consumer interest in assuring good health and longevity.  Also helping in the expansion of the dietary supplement market is the increase in product niche marketing to children, athletes, males, females, menopausal women and senior citizens.  Responding to this growing demand, manufacturers have stepped up advertising campaigns in print, radio and television.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Nearly every medicine cabinet in the western world contains some sort of vitamins or supplements.  Many are never used because purchasers do not know what or how much they need of a given substance.  This product will answers those questions and more.</P>

<LI>Lab Tests to Detect Deficiency
<LI>Dosage and Usage Information
<LI>Warnings and Precautions

The compiled results of the questionnaire will give the user a listing of their own Recommended Daily Allowances and a suggested list of vitamins, minerals, and supplements to discuss with their personal physician or nutritionist.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Although herbs have been used for centuries to cure various ailments, healing in the 20th century has focused more on pharmaceuticals than on traditional herbal cures.  However, during the past decade, medicinal herbs have experienced a renaissance in the United States.  Today, herbal compounds are found in the pharmacy sections of large drugstore chains and supermarkets, direct mail catalogs, and natural products stores.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Many people have been attracted to herbal medicines due to the low health risk of treatments and their new found accessibility.  Media has focused on this rebirth in combination with the rise in alternative and complementary medical treatments.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Sales of medicinal herbs were estimated to be about $1.56 billion in 1995 and are projected to grow about 18 percent per year.  These products are sold as extracts, tinctures, ointments, syrups, lozenges, bulk items, teas or as supplements, either as individual herbs or in combination formulas.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><I>A Guide to Botanical Medicine</I>  provides a multimedia exploration of the history, culturally diverse uses and medicinal properties of botanic matter, as well as providing information about the propagation of herbs for personal use. The disc will contain an Internet connection pointing specifically to an Isis site to provide the user with updated information and with a list of additional complementary sites.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Video segments</B> are included featuring interviews with subject matter experts, materials on the rainforest destruction, shamans at work, and herbal gardening.</P> 

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Topics</B> include:</P>

<UL><ALIGN=LEFT>
<LI><U>The Global Perspective</U>  This section provides the user with the historical and cultural uses of botanics focusing on Asian/Chinese herbology, Ayurvedic herbology, Mediterranean/European herbology, African traditional herbology, and homeopathy.

<LI><U>Being an Informed Consumer</U> How does the consumer decide where it is safe to purchase botanicals?  Why are they so popular?  What are the delivery mechanisms (teas, syrups, etc.)?  In addition, materials on various herbal treatments such as aromatherapy are presented.

<LI><U>Making Your Own Healing Garden</U>  The user will learn about propagation techniques, soil and climatic conditions, companion planting, collecting seeds, harvesting and storing plant parts, drying plant parts, etc.

<LI><U>Recipes for Personal Care</U>  How can you prepare herbal mixtures (such as hair rinses) at home?  What are safe?  How do you do it? What are the advantages of using the whole plant versus using just the medicinal components?

<LI><U>Visual Field Guide to Medicinal Plants</U>  This visual and textual compilation covers over 500 medicinal plants along with their known effects, speculated benefits, identifying characteristics, active compounds, and habitat.

<b><p>
Oocyte Donation<p>
</b><p>
<p>
<p>
Many women are unable to conceive because their ovaries do not produce healthy
eggs.  Oocyte donation gives these women the opportunity to get pregnant.
Women who may benefit from this procedure are women born without ovaries, women
whose ovaries have been removed due to endometriosis/tumors or damaged by
radiation/ chemotherapy, women whose ovaries do not function properly because
of age or chromosomal abnormalities, and women whose eggs did not fertilize
after in vitro fertilization (IVF).<p>
<p>
In the past several years, oocyte donation has become more and more popular
because it is so successful.  At the end of 1993, more than 2500 babies had
been born by oocyte donation.  The success rate of this procedure can be up to
50 percent, which is higher than any other method available.  The uterus does
not "age" as quickly as as the ovaries, and that is why even menopausal women
have been able to get pregnant with this technique.<p>
<p>
The oocyte donation procedure starts with the use of medications to synchronize
the donor and recipient menstrual cycles.  Once they are synchronized, the
donor receives injections of fertility medications that produce a number of
eggs in her ovaries. When the eggs have developed to the right stage, the eggs
are removed with a small needle inserted through the vagina.  The eggs are
fertilized in the laboratory with the partner's (or donor) sperm.  The
fertilized eggs develop into embryos, which are placed into the uterus of the
recipient two days later.  At the time the donor starts her fertility
medications, the recipient also starts hormonal therapy in order to get the
lining of her uterus ready for the embryos.  After the embryos are transferred,
the recipient continues hormonal therapy for a few months.<p>
<p>
Donor selection can be arranged privately, such as using a sister or friend, or
it can be provided through a recruitment agency.  Recruitment agencies have
their own fee schedules, but typically charge about $5,000 to recruit and
compensate the donor.  All egg donors are screened for any family history of
birth defects or hereditary diseases.  They also undergo psychological and
medical screening, and they are tested for infectious diseases.  The best
donors are usually women under 35 who have been pregnant previously, but donors
up to the age of 40 can be suitable in certain circumstances.<p>
<p>
The major risks of being an egg donor recipient are the risks associated with
pregnancy, (e.g. miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, premature labor, cesarean
section). Other risks can result from medications or a transmitted infection.
The medications used to synchronize the menstrual cycles can cause annoying
symptoms, such as hot flushes, mood swings, and headaches.  And, even though
the donors are screened for infectious diseases, it is not possible to
completely eliminate the risk of infection.  Finally, there is the possibility
that the donor may not respond appropriately to the medicine, that her eggs may
not fertilize, or that the recipient may not get pregnant.<p>

<blockquote>The Gerson Therapy is an intensive, nutrition-based and detoxifying medical
treatment for cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other chronic, degenerative diseases.  It works
closely with nature to help the sick body to rid itself of disease through the supportive effects of
simple foods, juices, and non-toxic medication.  Its successes in curing the dread diseases of our
times for the past 75 years have no parallel in the conventional medical context.<p>
The Gerson Institute is a non-profit organization dedicated to the holistic treatment of degenerative diseases. We strive to educate the public on the benefits of holistic healing through worldwide lectures and seminars, publication and distribution of literature on the Gerson Therapy, Training programs for Physicians, Healthcare practitioners, and home care assistants, and through establishing ties to approved clinics and treatment centers.

<P><A NAME="train"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>Gerson Therapy Physician
Training Program</FONT></P>

<P>For many physicians, managing the care of patients with chronic
debilitating illness can be a time-consuming and unfulfilling task.
Conventional protocols in treatment of degenerative diesases can
often offer limited benefit to the patient and can severely
compromise the quality of life during and after the treatment
period.</P> 

<P>The Gerson <FONT SIZE=-2>(tm)</FONT> Therapy provides
an answer to the physician who seeks a holistic, scientifically
proven treatment for life-threatening illness. Originally developed
in the 1930s by <A HREF="maxbio.html">Max Gerson, M.D.</A>, the
therapy offers the health care professional a safe, viable and
practical method of treating many degenerative diseases.</P> 

<P><A HREF="treatmnt.html">The Gerson Therapy</A> is an integrated
holistic protocol developed by Max Gerson, M.D. for standalone and
adjunctive use in the treatment of degenerative diseases. Over <A
HREF="biblio.html">200 articles</A> in the peer reviewed medical
literature document its effectiveness, and provide further
understanding of the tissue damage syndrome (intracellular edema),
supplementing nutritional deficiencies through the use of fresh,
organic fruit and vegetable juices. Providing an intensive, nutrition
based, high-fluid, micronutrient, salt and water management, the
Gerson Therapy is rich in phytochemicals, supplements potassium, and
restricts dietary fat, protien, and sodium. Extensive mechanical
detoxification through enemas combined with stimulation of
glutathione production systems dramatically improve elimination of
cell wastes.</P> 

<P>Because of the non-specific nature of the protocol, it is often
effective in treatment of a wide range of cancers, autoimmune,
collagen, and degenerative diesases. The Gerson Therapy has been
shown in the medical literature to be extraordinarily effective in
achieving long-term remission in Stage I-IV melanomas, exceeding
survival rates achieved with conventional managements by as much as
40%. [This study is available for viewing <A
HREF="melanoma.html">here</A>.] Dramatic long-term recoveries have
been observed with lymphoma, Duke's-C colorectal cancer, ovarian
cancer, and oat cell and adenocarcinomas of the lung. Biopsy-verified
full remissions have been observed in astrocytoma and cancers of the
breast, liver, pancreas and prostate, including some cases with
extensive metastases. Full remission of symptoms has been documented
in a number of cases of systematic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. </P> 

<P>Relatively unique about the Gerson management is that it does not
use any proprietary medications. All medications and supplements are
classed as biologicals, and are supplied in therapeutic amounts. All
are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. All of the
procedures, medications, and techniques used in the protocol have
been fully tested and effectively used for many years, and are
completely safe when used according to the protocol.</P> 

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Why The Gerson Therapy is a Sensible Choice for your
Practice</FONT></P>

<P>There are many paths to wellness, and many different philosophies
about appropriate treatment of life-threatening degenerative
diseases. <I>Why choose the Gerson Therapy over the many other
treatments available?</I></P> 

<P>We believe the answer lies in the combination of results, patient
satisfaction, scientific approach, and our philosophy of coordination
and partnership with practitioners and treatment centers.</P> 

<P>We believe the Gerson protocol itself to be the most complete,
all-encompassing approach to wellness available anyhwere. The Gerson
Therapy incorporates dietary and lifestyle modification,
sophisticated biochemical managements, intensive, multi-faceted
detoxification, psychological and mind/body approaches, and attention
to symptomatic relief through non-toxic means. When appropriate, the
Gerson protocol is combined with other proven managements to provide
the most complete, powerful approach to cancer and other degenerative
diseases available anywhere. We constantly review the medical
literature, seeking new ways of reaching even the most advanced cases
of cancer and disease. The Gerson Institute approaches modifications
and additions carefully, with great consideration, and sound testing
before inclusion in the Gerson protocol, ensuring both the
practitioner and patient of the safest, most efficacious treatment
available.</P>

<P>Adding the Gerson protocol to your practice will give you the
satisfaction of seeing rapid improvement in health and outlook in
otherwise &quot;terminal&quot; patients. Since patients are actively
involved in restoring and maintaining their own health, they tend to
develop self-reliance, decreasing &quot;emergency&quot; and panic
calls, and increasing satisfaction with their medical treatment. As a
certified Gerson practitioner, you will participate in case review
with the Gerson Institute, providing us with valuable statistical
data, and ensuring that you have appropriate expertise available for
the treatment of difficult or unusual cases.</P>

<P>Financially, working with Gerson patients is rewarding, as
patients will require consultations and follow-up care on a regular
basis for twenty-four months or longer. Also, since they become very
dedicated to their treatment, patients often discuss their treatment
with friends, co-workers, family, and others, resulting in
word-of-mouth referrals, the most effective form of advertising.</P>

<P>As a certified Gerson practitioner participating in our referral
program, you will benefit from our national advertising, outreach, and
education efforts. Patients seeking outpatient treatment in your area
will be referred to your practice. The Gerson Institute will also
coordinate with you and endeavor to schedule educational seminars and
lectures with Gerson Institute staff in your area, further helping to
build your clientele of Gerson Therapy patients.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Training Patients in the Gerson
Protocol</FONT></B></P>

<P>The responsibilities of the physician managing a patient on the
Gerson Therapy will vary with the condition of the patient and
diagnosis, but typically includes the regular monitoring of patient
status and disease staging through interpretation of pathology and
other appropriate means.</P> 

<P>Modifications in diet, medications, and other protocols must be
prescribed based on both traditional and non-traditional indications.
The physician must also be prepared to assist the patient in managing
acute healing reactions with dietary and/or medication modifications,
and emotional support. We have found that the psychological aspect of
treatment is important, particularly during this reaction period.
Access to the treating physician is vital, as many of the healing
responses are unfamiliar, and can therefore be frightening to the
patient and his or her family members or care providers.</P>

<P>In addition to the medical interventions required, it should be
understood that the Gerson protocol is a complex combination of
dietary restrictions, medication and enema administration, and
lifestyle and environmental changes. We recommend that practitioners
provide patients with complete instruction and followup in the
specifics of the treatment, either through the distribution of Gerson
Institute publications and videos, or through individualized patient
training and ongoing consultation.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Gerson Therapy Certification: A Partnership for
Success</FONT></B></P>

<P>The new era of managed care, limited resources, and tight cost
controls in medical treatment have opened the door for broad
acceptance of treatment such as the Gerson protocol. Gerson care
costs are significantly lower than conventional cancer managements,
benefiting insurance providers. Practitioners benefit by establishing
a health partnership with their patients, improving the
doctor/patient relationship, and reducing the likelihood of
dissatisfaction that can lead to costly legal actions.  Patients
benefit by developing self-confidence, improving their outlook, and
taking responsibility for their well-being.</P>

<P>Public demand for the scientifically proven Gerson Therapy
treatment is skyrocketing. In 1995, in response to the increasing
demand for Gerson Therapy treatment, the Gerson Institute began to
develop medical education and certification programs to increase
access to the Gerson Therapy, and to protect the reputation for
excellence and high quality care that the Gerson name has come to
represent.</P>

<P>Practitioners seeking to use the Gerson Therapy in
their practices achieve certification through a four-phase process.
Completion of the Level I training described below is the first phase.
The second phase is completion of a two-week internship at a Gerson
inpatient treatment center. Intern practitioners will work directly
with patients and experienced Gerson physicians. In phase three,
practitioners will treat patients in their own practice,
with assistance and supervision from Gerson Institute staff and
Gerson-trained physicians. The last phase is a three-day training,
review, and skill-assessment program. To maintain certification,
practitioners must maintain a high standard of patient care and
appropriate treatment, follow Gerson Institute guidelines regarding
patient management and treatment, provide data tothe Gerson Institute
for research, case management, and statistical purposes, and complete
approved continuing education units. We anticipate that
practitioners who work diligently will be able to complete the
certification process in twelve to eighteen months. A complete,
detailed description of the certification program will be available in
early 1997.</P>

<P>The certified practitioner will be eligible for a
number of benefits, including the following:</P><UL><LI>Ongoing
consultation and support from Gerson Institute staff and
Gerson-trained physicians</LI> <LI>Access to a network of other Gerson
practitioners</LI><LI>Gerson Institute patient referrals seeking
treatment and long-term follow-up</LI> <LI>Permission to use the
Gerson name in connection with treatment of patients and marketing for
new patients</LI> <LI>Support with local publicity and outreach to
develop your practice</LI> </UL> 

<P><B>We invite you to work with us. Through the efforts of our
organization and a group of talented, dedicated medical
practitioners, we can achieve our vision of making this safe,
effective treatment available to patients worldwide.</B></P><P> <HR

<P><A NAME="phase1"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Treating Degenerative Diseases
with the Gerson Therapy: Phase I Training Program</FONT></P> <P>This
program is designed to introduce the health care practitioner to the
practice of the Gerson protocol as originally described in Gerson's
Monograph, &quot;<I><A HREF="booklist.html#acancertherapy">A Cancer
Therapy</A></I>&quot; (Historic Edition, Gerson Institute, 1996), with
current enhancements and additions. The six day intensive training
will offer direct instruction from Charlotte Gerson, experienced
Gerson-trained physicians, and other senior Gerson Institute
staff.</P> <P>Practitioners attending the program will gain a
fundamental understanding of the Gerson Therapy treatment,
assessment, follow-up and monitoring protocols, and will have access
to resources for ongoing training, support, and consultation from the
Gerson Institute.</P><P>The nature of interactions between various
elements of the Gerson protocol require serious study and
considerable clinical experience before full understanding of the

<title>The Treatment</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
</head>

<body>

<h3>The Treatment</h3>



<p>Thirteen glasses daily of various fresh raw juices prepared hourly

from organically grown fruits and vegetables.

<p>Three full vegetarian meals, freshly prepared from organically grown

vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.



<p><h4>Individual medications including:</h4>

<pre>

    a.  potassium compound,

    b.  thyroid hormone,

    c.  Lugol's Solution

    d.  injectable crude liver extract with B-12,

    e.  pancreatic enzymes,

    f.  enemas of coffee and/or chamomile tea,

    g.  castor oil

</pre>



<p>The Gerson Therapy is an intensive, nutrition-based, medical

treatment. It works closely with nature to help the sick body to rid

itself of disease through the supportive effects of simple foods,

juices, and non-toxic medication.



<p><h4>The main features of the diet are:</h4>

<pre>

    1) sodium restriction,

    2) potassium supplementation,

    3) extreme fat restriction,

    4) periodic (temporary) protein restriction,

    5) high vitamin,

    6) high mineral,

    7) fluid rich,

    8) high micronutrient.

</pre>

<p>Although the diet allows for some cooked foods, emphasis is placed on

the consumption of unaltered foods.  Fresh, raw fruits and vegetables

are the source materials of all micronutrients in their pristine

organic composition.  Beyond supplying adequate quantities of all

known nutrients, the use of specific raw fruits and vegetables and

their juices ensures that patients receive even those health

promoting factors not yet appreciated by science.



<p>Medications used in the Gerson Therapy are classed as biologicals,

materials of organic origin which are found in the body and are

supplied in therapeutic amounts.



<p>An important treatment employed as part of the Gerson Therapy is

frequent detoxification of tissues and blood by coffee enemas which

cause stimulation of enzyme systems of the gut wall and liver and

promote excretion of toxic bile.

<h1>Dr. Max Gerson's Biography</h1>

<p>Dr. Max Gerson, M. D. was born in 1881 in Wongrowitz, Germany.  He

attended the Universities of Breslau, Wuerzburg, Berlin and Freiburg.

He was the director of a special department of tuberculosis at the

Munich University Hospital under the sponsorship of Dr. Ferdinand

Sauerbruch, a world famous thoracic surgeon and tuberculosis

authority.



<p>As a young German medical student, Gerson suffered from severe

migraine headaches.  He had been told that they were untreatable, and

that he would have to learn to live with them.  To his joy, Gerson

found that by restricting his diet, by avoiding salt, fats, pickled

and smoked foods, and by eating fresh fruits and vegetables, he could

control them.  Soon, he was sharing this new "migraine diet" with his

patients.



<p>One of Gerson's patients insisted that the migraine diet had cured his

skin tuberculosis.  Gerson listened, carefully weighing the

possibility that the diet might somehow be enhancing immunity.  He

decided that it might be true, and set out to validate it.  In the

process, his work came to the attention of Sauerbruch.  A new era in

medicine was born.  In 1929, Sauerbruch announced Gerson's dietary

therapy as a cure for skin TB, publishing simultaneously in a dozen of

the world's leading peer-reviewed scientific journals. Sauerbruch told

of a clinical trial of Gerson's dietary treatment in which 446 of 450

TB patients achieved lasting cures (also mentioned in Sauerbruch's

autobiography, "Master Surgeon").  Gerson lectured in the principal

cities of Europe until the pre-war political climate forced him to

emigrate in 1933.



<p>During this time, Gerson attracted the friendship of Nobel Prize

winner Albert Schweitzer, M. D., by curing his wife of lung

tuberculosis after she had failed to respond to all conventional

managements.  1934 saw the publication of "Diet Therapy for Lung

Tuberculosis" (pub. Franz Deuticke, Leipzig and Vienna) in which

Mrs. Schweitzer is documented case 45.  Gerson and Schweitzer remained

friends for life, and maintained a regular correspondence.  Schweitzer

followed Gerson's progress as the diet therapy was applied

successfully to a wide variety of pathologies, including heart and

kidney failure, and finally cancer.  Schweitzer's own adult onset

diabetes responded to Gerson's dietary treatment.



<p>In 1946, Gerson demonstrated recovered cancer patients before the

Pepper-Neely Congressional Sub-Committee, during hearings on S. 1875,

a bill to authorize the President to wage war on cancer. Although only

a few peer-reviewed journals were receptive to his revolutionary

ideas, Gerson continued to publish in the U. S. and abroad.



<p>Gerson died in 1959.  He was eulogized by Albert Schweitzer:



<p>"I see in him one of the most eminent geniuses in the history of

medicine.  Many of his basic ideas have been adopted without having

his name connected with them.  Yet he has achieved more than seemed

possible under adverse conditions.  He leaves a legacy which commands

attention and, which will assure him his due place.  Those whom he

cured will now attest to the truth of his ideas."

<title>History of the Gerson Therapy</title>
<body bgcolor="#7093DB">
</head>

<h3>History of the Gerson Therapy</h3>

<a href="ward.html"><h3>by Dr. Patricia Spain Ward</h3></a>



<p>It is one of the least edifying facts of recent American medical history that

the profession's leadership so long rejected as quackish the idea that

nutrition affects health (JAMA 1946 1949, 1977; Shimkin, 1976).  Ignoring both

the empirical dietary wisdom that pervaded western medicine from the

pre-Christian Hippocratic era until the late nineteenth century and a

persuasive body of modern research in nutritional biochemistry, the

politically minded spokesmen of organized medicine in the U.S.  remained 

long committed to surgery and radiation as the sole acceptable treatments for

cancer.  This commitment persisted, even after sound epidemiological data

showed that early detection and removal of malignant tumors did not "cure"

most kinds of cancer (Crile, 1956; updated by Cairns, 1985).



<p>The historical record shows that progress lagged especially in cancer

immunotherapy - including nutrition and hyperthermia - because power over

professional affiliation and publication (and hence over practice and

research) rested with men who were neither scholars nor practitioners nor

researchers themselves, and who were often unequipped to grasp the rapidly

evolving complexities of the sciences underlying mid-twentieth-century

medicine.



<p>Nowhere is this maladaption of professional structure to medicine's changing

scientific context more tragically illustrated than in the American experience

of Max B. Gerson (1881- 1959), founder of the best-known nutritional treatment

for cancer of the pre-macrobiotic era.  A scholar's scholar and a superlative

observer of clinical phenomena, Gerson was a product of the German medical

education which Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries considered

so superior to our own that all who could afford it went to Germany to perfect

their training (Bonner, 1963). As a medical graduate of the University of

Freiburg in 1909, Gerson imbibed all of the latest in scientific medicine,

with the emphasis on specificity which bacteriology had brought into western

medical thought in the preceding decades. Gerson subsequently worked with

leading German specialists in internal medicine, in physiological chemistry,

and in neurology (U.S. Congress, 1946, 98). The historical record does not

tell us whether his medical education in Germany (where much of the early work

in nutritional chemistry took place) included a study of diet, a subject

neglected in American medical schools after the germ theory gained acceptance.



<p>We do know that by 1919, when Gerson set up a practice in internal and nervous

diseases in Bielefeld, he had devised an effective dietary treatment for the

migraine headaches which frequently disabled him, despite the best efforts of

his colleagues. In 1920, while treating migraine patients by this salt-free

vegetarian diet, he discovered that it was also effective in lupus vulgaris

(tuberculosis of the skin, then considered incurable) and, later, in arthritis

as well (U.S. Congress, 1946, 98).



<p>Trained in the theories of specific disease causation and treatment that began

to dominate western medicine - for the first time in history - as

bacteriological discoveries multiplied in the late nineteenth century, Gerson

was at first uneasy about using a single therapy in such seemingly disparate

conditions.  But he was committed to the primacy of clinical evidence, which

he liked to express in Kussmaul's dictum: "The result at the sick-bed is

decisive" (quoted in Gerson, 1958, 212).  In later years, after research began

to provide explanations for Gerson's clinical observations, he quoted

Churchill on the mistaken course of action he had thus avoided: "Men

occasionally stumble over the truth, but most pick themselves up and hurry off

as if nothing had happened" (Gerson, 1958, 212).  Gerson persisted. In 1924

his success in treating tuberculosis of the skin brought an invitation from

the noted thoracic surgeon, Ferdinand Sauerbruch, to test Gerson's diet in a

special lupus clinic to be provided by the Bavarian government at the

University of Munich. As Sauerbruch recounts it in his autobiography, 446

patients out of 450 recovered - once he had discovered and put an end to the

smuggling of sausages, cream and beer to the patients in the late afternoons (

Sauerbruch, 1953, 167- 171 ).  Later extended to pulmonary tuberculosis as

well, this Gerson-Sauerbruch-Hermannsdorfer diet was widely used in Germany

and became the subject of Gerson's first book in 1934 (Gerson, 1934;

Hildenbrand, 1987 communication).



<p>During the late twenties and early thirties Gerson had several experiences

which informed his later thinking on diet and degenerative disease. As a

member of the State Board of Health, appointed by the Prussian government, he

was given extraordinary laboratory support for a clinical trial of diet in

pulmonary tuberculosis.  Besides the physiological parameters customarily

monitored in such work, Gerson was able to track minute fluctuations in the

patients' mineral metabolism and also in the chemical composition of the foods

he prescribed (Gerson, 1958, 183). At this same period he served as consultant

to the Prussian Ministry of Health on the best ways to restore to agricultural

usefulness the exhausted soil around several major German cities (Gerson,

1958, 183). When he learned that modern farming methods often rob plant foods

of their natural mineral and vitamin riches, while increasing their sodium

content, he began to think of the earth's well-being as central to our own.

Eventually he began to refer to the soil, which nourishes the food we eat, as

our "external metabolism" (Gerson 1958, 175). 



<p>It was in 1928 that Gerson first used his diet in cancer, at the insistence of

a woman who had jaundice, high fever and two small liver metastases after

unsuccessful surgery for cancer of the bile duct (Gerson, 1958, 31). On the

strength of reports she had heard of Gerson's work with tuberculosis, this

woman insisted that he write out a diet for the treatment of her cancer.

Gerson reluctantly agreed - after he obtained her signed statement that she

would not hold him responsible for the outcome!  As he recalled it many years

later, this same patient had him read aloud to her a chapter called "The

Healing of Cancer" from a big book of about 1200 pages on folk medicine, "

edited by three schoolteachers and one physician, none of them practitioners.

It was from this source that Gerson first learned of the special soup which

Hippocrates supposedly gave to cancer patients and which Gerson made a fixture

of his cancer Therapy (Gerson, 1958, 31, 403-404; Gerson, 1978, 449-450).

Having taken up this challenge against his will, with no hope of success,

Gerson was astounded when his patient seemed fully recovered within six months

(Gerson, 1958, 405). In quick succession he had the same good results with two

patients with inoperable stomach cancer, both referred by this first patient.

Late in life he continues to marvel at these apparent recoveries under his

diet treatment (Gerson, 1958, 404- 405). (These notable histories, which

Gerson recounted in some detail, have prompted one recent researcher to

suggest the possible involvement of aldoslerone as the mechanism of

mineral-corticoid sensitivity in gastrointestinal tumors.  See McCarty, 1981).



<p>In Vienna, where he lived for a time after the rise of Hitler, Gerson's

treatment failed in all seven patients he attempted to treat in this manner -

a failure which, in later years, he attributed to inadequate dietary

provisions in the sanitarium where he then worked (Gerson, 1958, 31-32, 405).

In Paris, where he lived in 1935-36, the diet produced good results in three

out of seven cases (Gerson, 1958, 32, 405; Gerson, 1978, 451), inspiring him

to pursue such treatment further after he emigrated to the United States in

1938.



<p>Gerson constantly sought explanations for his observations in the scientific

literature, where he read widely in several languages (Gerson, 1958). In 1954,

in "Cancer, a Problem of Metabolism," he credited J. Maisin (1923) and B.

Fischer-Wasels (1929) with advancing physiological explanations of general

predisposition toward tumor formation and abandoning the theory of cancer

causation by local irritation.  For the next few decades (according to

Gerson's account of the evolution of cancer concepts) there was a tendency to

interpret cancer in terms of constitution and diathesis, as was done with

diabetes, gout and tuberculosis. It was Caspari (Nutrition and Cancer, 1938)

who turned to metabolic explanation of the kind Gerson ultimately favored

(Gerson, 1954, 1). He devoted an entire chapter of his book to a review of

efforts, largely by German researchers, to alter metabolism by diet (Gerson,

1958, 89-104). He found special appeal in Otto Warburg, The Metabolism of

Tumors, (London, 1930), in G. von Bergmann's Funktionelle Pathologie (Berlin,

1932), and in Frederick Hoffman's massive compilation, Cancer and Diet

(Baltimore, 1937).  Gradually, out of his bedside experience and his reading,

he formed a unitary theory of degenerative disease (including cancer) which

rested on one of the oldest and most pervasive concepts in the history of

medicine: the vis medicatrix naturae or healing power of nature (Neuburger,

1926 and 1944; Warner, 1978). Endlessly seeking out the latest researches and

theories in physiology, biochemistry, and - increasingly - immunology, Gerson

rapidly integrated these massive bodies of new detail into the larger

framework of what he called "the physician within", that is, the natural powers of resistance,
which we today call the immune system.



<p>Gerson believed that cancer changes the body's normal sodium/potassium

balance, already disturbed by modern diet. Thus his therapy used foods low in

sodium (no salt added), high in potassium, and rich in vitamins A and C and

oxidizing enzymes. He excluded fats and dairy products for the first four to

six weeks, considering them dangerously burdensome to the digestion in the

extremely sick patients who usually came to him only after having exhausted

conventional measures.  Above all it was essential for patients to eliminate

excess sodium, which Gerson believed responsible for altering cellular

electrochemistry in favor of cancerous growth.



<p>There is now a great deal of research suggesting possible mechanisms for the

efficacy of Gerson's high potassium/low sodium diet. As he suspected and we

now know, hypokalemia often accompanies cancer of the colon, and alterations

in electrical and mineral states occur often in cancer patients (Newell, 1981,

87). Cone has furnished experimental proof of a correlation between the level

of electrical potential across somatic cell membranes and the intensity of

mitotic activity (Cone, 1971 ), a finding supported by Zs.-Nagy and his

colleagues in studies so human thyroid cancer (Zs. -Nagy, 1983) .  Ling's

association/induction hypothesis is based on laboratory studies which show

that damaged cells partially return to their normal configuration in high

potassium/low sodium environments (Ling, 1943), perhaps explaining the

remarkable tissue repair which Gerson sometimes saw in his formerly

debilitated patients (Cope, 1978). Lai has suggested that intracellular sodium

and potassium levels may furnish the mechanism for regulating cellular

differentiation and transformation (Lai, 1985) .



<p>To supply active oxidation enzymes and potassium-rich minerals, Gerson's

patients drank hourly glasses of freshly prepared vegetable and fruit juices.

As early as 1933-34, while living in Vienna, Gerson had begun giving

injections of liver extract, as another means of stimulating the patient's

liver (Gerson, 1958, 31 -32).  In later years he had patients drink two to

three glasses daily of the juice of calves' liver pressed with carrots.  In

addition to beta-carotene/vitamin A, this would supply iron and copper, both

of which affect peripheral T cell functions and other peripheral lymphocyte

subpopulations (Keusch, 1983, 345- 347).  



<p>Although the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry labeled as a "false notion"

the idea that diet can affect cancer, recent researchers have found that

"nutritional status plays a critical role in immunological defense mechanisms

at a number of important levels" (Keusch, 1983, 345) and that nutritional

factors "can have profound influences on ... the development and

manifestations of cancers" as well as other diseases (Good, 1982, 85). In "The

Cancerostatic Effect of Vegetarian Diets" ( 1983), Siguel describes as the

ideal way to strengthen bodily defenses against neoplastic cells a diet

similar to Gerson's: high in carbohydrates and vegetables, low in protein.


<p>Like von Bergmann, Gerson believed that "every defense and healing power of

the body depends on the capacity of the body to produce a so-called 'allergic

inflammation'"- a truth long recognized by surgeons, but somehow forgotten by

medicine during the heyday of microbiology.  To Gerson this capacity to

produce inflammation was "the decisive part of the body's 'weapon of healing

power'" (Gerson, 1958, 127-28).



<p>Noting that fluid from a normal inflammation metabolism kills cancer cells,

but that blood serum does not, von Bergmann concluded that a cancer metabolism

occurs when the body can no longer produce this healing inflammatory reaction

(Gerson, 1958, 120- 121 ). Gerson agreed, but in contrast to von Bergmann and

most of his contemporaries, Gerson believed it was often possible for the

physician to help restore the vital power of inflammation, even in anergic

patients with advanced cancer. If cancer was a degenerative disease caused by

the cumulative effect of inadequate nutrition with foods grown in soils

depleted by artificial fertilizers and poisoned by toxic insecticides and

herbicides, doctors must respond by replenishing the entire human organism.

For a condition that represented an ultimate failure of equilibrium in a

poisoned metabolism, removal of tumors by surgery or radiation was merely

superficial, symptomatic treatment.  "Medicine," Gerson said, "must be able to

adapt its therapeutic methods to the damages of the processes of our modern

civilization" (Gerson, 1958, 199).



<p>Gerson set about doing this by altering the basic diet he had used earlier in

other conditions. Through meticulous observation of his patients in New York

(where he passed state boards in 1939), he perfected a regimen of detoxication

and diet requiring a high degree of compliance by the patient, heroic devotion

by the patient's family, and close attention and frequent adjustment by the

physician.  His therapy aimed to detoxify the body and restore its healing

apparatus, especially the liver, the visceral nervous system, and the

reticulo-mesenchymal system.



<p>Gerson first encountered the idea of detoxication in cancer in the version of

Hippocratic regimen which he read with his first cancer patient in Bielefeld

in 1928 (Gerson, 1958, 404). After losing several cancer patients to hepatic

coma rather than to direct effects of the disease (Gerson, 1958, 191 ), he

realized that "The digestive tract is very much poisoned in cancer'.  The

liver and pancreas failed to function: "nothing is active" (Gerson, 1958,

407). To stimulate the liver, he began to use coffee enemas, which 0.A.  Meyer

of Goettingen had found effective in opening the bile ducts in animals and

which American surgeons in that period were using in acute adrenal

insufficiency and in shock from postoperative hemorrhage and bleeding peptic

ulcer (Beeson, 1980, 90, 96; Rothstein, 1987, 124). As he watched the progress

of his patients, he found that he could accelerate detoxication by giving

coffee enemas more frequently, with the addition of castor oil, by mouth and

by rectum (Gerson, 1958, 81).



<p>Although Gerson used caffeine enemas primarily to facilitate excretion of

toxic wastes, especially from necrosing tumors, we now realize that these

enemas also promoted the absorption of vitamin A, a process requiring the

action of bile acids (Simone, 1943, 64). Thus the enemas that brought ridicule

from Gerson's enemies actually enabled his patients to use the enormous

amounts of vitamin A which his diet provided (recently estimated at about

100,000 IU daily: see Seifter, 1988). Vitamin A, in turn, plays a vital role

in immune function, perhaps by causing the helper cells to induce the

production of interleukin-2, or by causing killer cell precursors to activate

cytotoxic mechanisms, or by causing suppressor T cells to eliminate down

regulation (Keusch, 1983, 330-331 ).



<p>Gerson also found that caffeine enemas greatly reduce pain, a particular boon

in his regimen, which avoids the use of opiates and other painkilling drugs

that might overtax the liver at a time when its limited capacity is needed for

immune functions and for eliminating the toxic products of tumor breakdown.




<p>Although the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry labeled as a "false notion"

the idea that diet can affect cancer, recent researchers have found that

"nutritional status plays a critical role in immunological defense mechanisms

at a number of important levels" (Keusch, 1983, 345) and that nutritional

factors "can have profound influences on ... the development and

manifestations of cancers" as well as other diseases (Good, 1982, 85). In "The

Cancerostatic Effect of Vegetarian Diets" ( 1983), Siguel describes as the

ideal way to strengthen bodily defenses against neoplastic cells a diet

similar to Gerson's: high in carbohydrates and vegetables, low in protein.



<p>Gerson gradually added a few medications to his diet.  One of these was

niacin, which he believed would help restore proper intracellular potential,

raise depleted liver stores of glycogen and potassium, and aid in protein

metabolism (Gerson, 1958, 32, 99- 100, 209). Another was iodine, which Gerson

initially used only in cases of low metabolic rates. When he found that "The

best range of healing power" was a BMR of +6 to +8 (monitored by organic

iodine in blood serum), and that iodine seemed to counteract the neoplastic

effect of hormones, he incorporated iodine into the basic regimen, at first in

the form of thyroid extract, later as inorganic Lugol's solution (iodine plus

potassium iodide) (Gerson, 1958, 32, 409; U.S. Congress, 1946, 114).  Several

researchers have showed that thyroid raises natural resistance to infection by

augmenting the power of reticuloendothelial cells and by increasing antibody

formation - thus supporting Gerson's hunch that iodine was a decisive factor

in the normal differentiation of cells (Lurie, 1960; Thorbecke, 1962).



<p>Despite the fact that he had no inpatient facility until 1946, when he opened

a clinic in Nanuet, New York, Gerson managed, through his thriving Park Avenue

practice and an affiliation at Gotham Hospital, to amass enough data to

publish a preliminary report in 1945. He presented his rather remarkable case

histories modestly, concluding that he did not yet have enough evidence to say

whether diet could either influence the origin of cancer or alter the course

of an established tumor. He claimed only that the diet, which he described in

considerable detail, could favorably affect the patient's general condition,

staving off the consequences of malignancy and making further treatment

possible (Gerson, 1945).



<p>Gerson may have struck an Establishment nerve with his statement that many

physicians use surgery and/or radiation "without systematic treatment of the

patient as a whole" (Gerson, 1945, 419). But it seems more likely that it was

his growing success in practice, or perhaps even his opposition to tobacco,

that first drew the wrath of organized medicine.  ( Philip Morris was then

JAMA's major source of advertising revenue: see Rorty, 1939, 182 - 194).



<p>In any case the AMA did not openly attack Gerson until November 1946, a few

months after he testified in support of a Senate bill to appropriate $100

million to bring together the world's outstanding cancer experts in order to

coordinate a search for the prevention and cure of cancer. At hearings before

Senator Claude Pepper's sub-committee in July 1946, Gerson demonstrated

recovered patients who had come to him after conventional methods could no

longer help.  Dr.  George Miley, medical director of the 85-bed Gotham

Hospital, where Gerson had treated patients since January, 1946, gave strong

supporting medical testimony (U.S. Congress, 1946).



<p>In a surly editorial response, JAMA said it was "fortunate" that this Senate

appearance received little newspaper publicity; the AMA was clearly outraged

that Gerson's appearance had become the subject of a favorable radio

commentary, broadcast nationwide by ABC's Raymond Gram Swing (U.S. Congress,

1946, 31-35; JAMA, 1946). The JAMA editorial focused on Gerson, even though it

was not Gerson but a lay witness, immune to AMA retaliation, who had called

Gerson's successes "miracles" and urged the Senators to secure their future

cancer commission against control by any existing medical organization (U.S.

Congress, 1946, 96,97).



<p>It was not Gerson, but Dr. Miley, who told the Senators that a long-term

survey by a well-known and respected physician showed that those who received

no cancer treatment lived longer than those who received surgery, radiation or

X-ray (U.S. Congress, 1946, 117).  Perhaps because Miley was a Northwestern

medical graduate, an established physician licensed in four states, and a

fellow of the AMA and state and county societies of Pennsylvania and New York,

Morris Fishbein did not attack him personally.  Instead, he limited himself to

intimations of fiscal impropriety in the Robinson Foundation, which owned

Miley's Gotham Hospital, and to the scandalous revelation that the director of

the section on health education of this Foundation (which was promoting "an

unestablished, somewhat questionable method of treating cancer") was not an

M.D. at all, but a Yale University professor of economics!



<p>Compared to Miley's testimony, Gerson's was innocent, concentrating on the

histories of the patients he brought with him and on the likely mechanisms

whereby his diet caused tumor regression and healing.  Only under pressure

from Senator Pepper did Gerson state that about 30% of those he treated showed

a favorable response ( U.S.  Congress, 1946, 115).  Nonetheless, JAMA devoted

two pages to undermining Gerson's integrity (JAMA, 1946). Showing no restraint

where Gerson was concerned, Fishbein, contrary to fact, alleged that successes

with the Gerson-Sauerbruch-Hermannsdorfer diet "were apparently not

susceptible of duplication by most other observers. " He also falsely claimed

that Gerson had several times refused to supply the AMA with details of the

diet. (Fishbein said he could provide them in this editorial only because

"there has come to hand through a prospective patient" of Gerson a diet

schedule for his treatment.)  Fishbein emphasized, without comment, Gerson's

caution about the use of other medications, especially anesthetics, because

they produced dangerously strong reactions in the heightened allergic state of

his most responsive patients.



<p>Fishbein attempted to tie together this strange patchwork of slurs against

Gerson and against research supported by lay-dominated industrial corporations

with his accustomed mastery of innuendo: "The entire performance, including

the financial backing, the promotion and the scientific reports, has a

peculiar effluvium which, to say the least, is distasteful and, at its worst,

creates doubt and suspicion" (JAMA, 1946, 646).



<p>Through no fault of his own, Gerson was again portrayed favorably in the news

in 1947, when John Gunther, in Death Be Not Proud, credited Gerson with

extending the life of Gunther's son during the boy's ultimately unsuccessful

struggle with brain cancer. Beginning that same year the New York County

Medical Society staged five "investigations" of Gerson and eventually

suspended him for "advertising" his "secret" methods.



<p>At this point Gerson's life took on a nightmare quality. The Pepper-Neely bill

met defeat and, with it, the hope for coordinated cancer research free of

prior restraints against investigations of anything other than "established"

methods. In 1949 the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, in a report

entitled "Cancer and the Need for Facts", rehashed material from the earlier

editorial, adding that the Gerson diet was "lacking in essential protein and

fat" and that Gerson's concern about the dangers of anesthesia was "wholly

unfounded and apparently designed to appeal to the cancer victim already

fearful of a surgical operation which might offer the only effective means for

eradication of the disease".  Without benefit of either a literature search or

new clinical or laboratory research, the Council labeled as a "false notion"

the idea that "diet has any specific influence on the origin or progress of

cancer". They concluded that "There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to

indicate that modifications in the dietary intake of food or other nutritional

essentials are of any specific value in the control of cancer" (Council on

Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1949, 96). Gerson lost his hospital affiliation and

found that young doctors who wanted to assist him and learn from him could not

do so, for fear of incurring Society discipline.  He was denied malpractice

insurance, because his therapy was not "accepted practice" (Moss, 1980, 178;

Natenberg, 1959, 136).



<p>In the early fifties Gerson submitted five case histories to the NCI,

requesting an official investigation.  He was told that they would need 25

cases, which he promptly supplied, with full documentation.  More than a year

later the NCI demanded 125 case histories, saying that the 25 they had

previously requested were insufficient to justify investigation.



<p>According to a 1981 publication of the Gerson Institute, headed by his

daughter, Charlotte Gerson, a manuscript for a book he was writing about his

therapy disappeared from his files in 1956 (Healing, 1981, 19) At the age of

75, isolated from medical colleagues and unable to find assistants, Gerson

undertook the work of rewriting the entire manuscript in order to show "that

there is an effective treatment of cancer, even in advanced cases" (Gerson,

1958, 3). It was published in 1958, as A Cancer Therapy: Results of Fifty

Cases. Gerson died of pneumonia the following year, before finishing a second

volume. His ideas have gained wide distribution through subsequent editions of

his book (1975, 1977, and 1986); through a 1962 publication called Has Dr. Max

Gerson a True Cancer Cure?, which had reportedly sold more than 250,000 copies

by 1980 (Moss, 1980, 178); and through the publications and physician-training

programs of the Gerson Institute in Bonita, California, and the Hospital de

Baja California.



<p>In 1980 a reformed JAMA carried a commentary called "The 'Grand Conspiracy'

Against the Cancer Cure" by William Regelson of the Department of Medicine of

the Medical College of Virginia. Surveying a series of "inappropriate

judgments [that] have resulted in injury to good observations," Regelson said,

"We may shortly have to ask if Gerson's low-sodium diet, with its bizarre

coffee enemas and thyroid supplementation, was an approach that altered the

mitotic regulating effect of intracellular sodium for occasional clinical

validity in those patients with the stamina to survive it" (Regelson, 1980,

338).



<p>Disregarding such suggestions and resting its case instead on the claim that

the NCI had "found no convincing evidence of effectiveness" during a review of

ten Gerson cases some forty years earlier, the American Cancer Society in 1987

stated that "The Gerson method of cancer treatment is not considered a proven

means of cancer treatment, and on the basis of available information, the

Institute does not believe that further evaluation of this therapy is called

for at this time" (American Cancer Society, February 5, 1987).



<p>Testing is underway, however, outside of the U.S. Since 1984 a modified form

of Gerson's therapy has been in use at the Second Department of Surgery of the

Krankenhaus in Graz, Austria.  Omitting liver juice and niacin, using thyroid

only in hypothyroid patients, and limiting caffeine enemas to two per day,

Peter Lechner and his colleagues, all of them surgeons, have been testing the

Gerson method as an adjunct, often with chemotherapy or radiation, in 60

post-operative cancer patients, male and female, ranging in age from 23 to 74,

and representing many different forms of cancer. By pairing each patient who

was willing to use the Gerson method (GP) with one of similar age and

condition who chose not to try it (NGP) and observing the comparative progress

of the disease in the two groups over a four-year period, Lechner and his

colleagues have approximated a controlled study of admittedly imperfect

structure (Lechner, 198 7).



<p>Their findings show that the Gerson therapy made a notable difference in

several forms of cancer. Although GPs with bone metastases had no better

survival or tumor response than NGPs, their relief from pain and absence of

hypercalcemia made for a better quality of life.  GPs with lung metastases

required fewer procedures to relieve pleural effusion. GPs with brain

metastases experienced decreased edema and lived four months longer than their

paired NGPs.  Premenopausal and perimenopausal breast cancer GPs tolerated

conventional treatments better, with fewer side effects; showed better liver

and kidney function and blood counts; and had fewer local recurrences and no

metastases.  Breast cancer GPs with liver metastases tolerated chemotherapy

better, and one of three has been in a steady state for more than a year,

while the remaining five have died.  GPs with colorectal carcinoma seemed to

gain weight and recover better after surgery, but showed no significant

difference in incidence of secondaries or local recurrence. The best

responders to date are GPs with liver metastases, with two GPs showing

improved hepatic enzyme profiles compared to two NGPs; in four other pairs,

although profiles remained similar, the GPs lived twice as long as the NGPs

(Lechner, 1987).



<p>It is an irony of both history and geography that the first comparative study

of Max Gerson's therapy should take place at the hands of surgeons, in that

part of the world which Gerson fled as a Jewish refugee half a century ago and

that the results, while not so outstanding as those he seemed able to produce,

are most encouraging in patients with severe damage to the liver, the organ he

considered central to recovery.

<blockquote>The Gerson Therapy is an intensive, nutrition-based and detoxifying medical
treatment for cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other chronic, degenerative diseases.  It works
closely with nature to help the sick body to rid itself of disease through the supportive effects of
simple foods, juices, and non-toxic medication.  Its successes in curing the dread diseases of our
times for the past 75 years have no parallel in the conventional medical context.<p>
The Gerson Institute is a non-profit organization dedicated to the holistic treatment of degenerative diseases. We strive to educate the public on the benefits of holistic healing through worldwide lectures and seminars, publication and distribution of literature on the Gerson Therapy, Training programs for Physicians, Healthcare practitioners, and home care assistants, and through establishing ties to approved clinics and treatment centers.

<LI><B>Objective</B> - Compare 5-year melanoma survival rates to rates in medical literature

<LI><B>Design</B> - Retrospective.

<LI><B>Setting</B> - Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico.

<LI><B>Patients</B> - White adult patients (N=153) with superficial spreading and nodular melanoma, aged 25-72 years.

<LI><B>Intervention</B> - Gerson's diet therapy: lactovegetarian; low sodium, fat and (temporarily) protein; high potassium, fluid, and nutrients (hourly raw vegetable/fruit juices). Metabolism increased by thyroid; calorie supply limited to 2600-3200 cal
ories per day. Coffee enemas as needed for pain and appetite.

<LI><B>Main Outcome Measure</B> - 5-year survival rates by stage at admission.

<LI><B>Results</B> - Of 14 patients with stages I and II (localized) melanoma, 100% survived for 5 years, compared with 79% of 15,798 reported by Balch. Of 17 with stage IIIA (regionally metastasized)

melanoma, 82% were alive at 5 years, in contrast to 39% of 103 from Fachklinik Hornheide. Of 33 with combined stages IIIA + IIIB (regionally metastasized) melanoma, 70% lived 5 years, compared with

41% of 130 from Fachklinik Hornheide. We propose a new stage division: IVA (distant lymph, skin, and subcutaneous tissue metastases), and IVB (visceral metastases). Of 18 with stage IVA melanoma, 39% were alive at 5 years, compared with only 6% of 194 fro
m the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. Survival impact was not assessed for stage IVB. Male and female survival rates were identical for stages I-IIIB, but stage IVA women had a strong survival advantage.

<LI><B>Conclusions</B> - The 5-year survival rates reported here are considerably higher than those reported elsewhere. Stage IIIA/B males had exceptionally high survival rates compared with those reported by other centers. (Alternative Therapies in Healt
h and Medicine.  1995;1(4):29-37)

<P>This article summarizes the clinical outcomes of melanoma patients treated with the nutrition-based cancer therapy proposed by the German physician Gerson[1] (who conducted research at the University

of Munich in the 1930s) and contrasts them with rates reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this report is the most thorough retrospective analysis to date of the potential survival benefit of this, or any other, well-known alternative method of c
ancer management.  

<P>The genesis of this inquiry occurred during a landmark study by the US Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA)[2] to which one of us (GH) was an advisor. In its report, OTA put forward a protocol for best-case reviews based on the premise t
hat, no matter how many patients failed, as few as 10 or 12 cases with objective evidence of tumor response would be enough to propel an investigation by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Because we had proposed the original best-case review protocol t
o OTA, we were eager to construct such a review. However, we found OTA's (and later NCI's) protocol to have a serious shortcoming when used retrospectively: its focus on tumor regression only. Adequate documentation of tumor regression is unlikely to be c
ollected in most alternative medical practices.  

<P>We abandoned the best-case review for the more informative retrospective review. In contrast to the best-case review, the retrospective review describes all patients, including nonresponders, giving a more adequate impression of the outcomes of treatme
nt.   

<P>Our efforts to complete a best-case review, however, were not without some rewards. Practitioners at Centro Hospitalario Internacional del Pacifico, SA (CHIPSA) in Playas de Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico suggested cases with different types of  canc
er they believed had unusually positive outcomes. Of the 27 cases cataloged, 33% were long-term melanoma survivors, which underscored the need to do a more complete evaluation of melanoma per se.

<P>In the process, we determined that the institutions at which the patients were originally diagnosed were reliable. We requested histological specimens for the above 27 cases, and forwarded the numbered slides, without clinical histories, to the Armed F
orces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). AFIP pathologists' findings agreed with those reported by the original institutions with the exception of one specimen, which had been destroyed by improper handling and storage. In a related exercise, original diagnos
tic scans were read by contemporary UCLA physicians, whose interpretations were in virtually complete agreement with those of the original readers.

<P>Over 15 years, from 1975 through July 1990, 249 patients presented for treatment of melanoma; however, 53 (21%) were lost to follow-up. Survival outcomes were learned for the other 196, but 14

were excluded because they did not have verified nodular or superficial spreading melanoma. Of the remaining 182, 29 (19%) charts could not be assessed for stage at admission. Therefore, this paper is based on the outcomes of 153 adult melanoma patients t
reated with Gerson's nutrition-based cancer therapy. All assessable patients were white. Almost all were hospitalized by CHIPSA physicians, but several were treated by physicians in private practice. Medical charts supplied by CHIPSA were consolidated fro
m three predecessor facilities, Hospital la Gloria, Hospital Jardines la Mesa, and

Hospital del Sol, all from the Tijuana metropolitan area.

<P>Gerson is credited with the introduction and development of therapeutic sodium (Na+) restriction[3] in the context of a high potassium (K+) diet, which was first broadly tested in refractory cutaneous tuberculosis (lupus vulgaris)[4] According to emine
nt dermatologist Erich Urbach[5], the majority of authors of note investigated and approved Gerson's diet therapy for lupus.  Emerson[6] was the first US author to refer to the diet as a metabolic therapy. Gerson's tuberculosis diet became the basis of a 
number of quite different dietotherapies he developed for conditions as diverse as pulmonary tuberculosis and cardiorenal insufficiency.

<P>The cancer management employed by CHIPSA was developed empirically by Gerson over the course of 30 years of clinical experimentation[7].  Gradually, by trial and error, Gerson evolved an integrated set of medical treatments, which he last published in 
a 1958 monograph along with 50 cases presented in clinical detail[8].

<P>Although Gerson's method was published several times in US[9] and German[10-12] refereed journals, it is not well known by most practitioners and researchers. Therefore, a brief description of the development and nature of the therapy may be useful.

<P>During the 1930s, Gerson's research at the University of Munich was afforded extraordinary laboratory support through funding provided by both the Bavarian and Prussian federal governments[13]. Gerson focused on the experimental use of diet and medicat
ions to improve tissue edema occurring in a variety of pathologies. Edema is characterized by salt and water changes that Cope[14] has defined as tissue damage syndrome--decreased cell K+, increased cell Na+, and increased cell water (cell swelling) --cha
nges that are also observed after death[15].  Nutritional treatment to provide cells with a high K+, low Na+ environment improved edema and led to enhanced tissue resistance and immunities, and therefore better outcomes[16].  This rationale can be traced 
through all of Gerson's subsequent efforts in cancer management. [8(pp164, 166, 184, 197)]

<P>The cancer diet is individualized to meet the needs of every patient, but it does have uniform components. For most patients, it is restricted in salt, fat, and (temporarily) protein. It supplies very high quantities of many nutrients and phytochemical
s while at the same time forcing fluids through 13 hourly feedings of raw fruit and vegetable juices daily. About half of the melanoma subjects in this study received 24 ounces daily of raw veal liver and carrot juice (each glass contained the pressings o
f 1/2 pound of liver and 3/4 pound of carrots). Following numerous disruptions in supplies that began in late 1985, raw veal liver was formally discontinued in 1987 because of repeated instances of bacterial contamination (Campylobacter fetus s. fetus). C
omparisons of patients from different time frames indicate that those receiving liver juice experienced better survival outcomes overall[15].

<P>Gerson restricted calories while simultaneously increasing metabolism in an effort to emulate the antitumor effect of calorie restriction per se, first demonstrated by Moreschi[18] and Rous[19]. Enhanced caloric utilization rates (metabolism) can alter
 tumor growth, whether metabolism is accelerated by iodine medications[20]  (Gerson used thyroid and Lugol's iodine solution) or exercise[21]. The caloric supply is limited to 2600-3200 calories per day by the low-fat, lactovegetarian diet served in three
 generous daily meals. Niacin, potassium salts (acetate, gluconate, and monophosphate), and crude liver extract with vitamin B12 injectable, were given to support accelerated cellular energy production.

<P>In the University of Munich experiments, Gerson found that temporary protein restriction aided edema absorption[22] and favored improvement in his patients. In Gerson's cancer diet, protein repletion with nonfat cultured dairy products occurs after at 
least 6 weeks in most cases. Shorter periods of protein restriction are recommended for children and elderly patients.

<P>Castor oil, a cathartic with no known clinical side effects, was administered every other day for many weeks. Retention enemas medicated with boiled coffee were taken as needed, as frequently as every 4 hours throughout the day and night, for their obs
erved ability to alleviate pain and to improve nutritional condition. Peter Lechner observed statistically significant cancer pain relief from coffee enemas in a prospective matched control trial at the University Hospital of Graz, Austria[23]. Although t
he mechanism of pain relief is not known, Cope[7] suggested it may be the result of a crude sort of dialysis across the gut wall for tumor breakdown products such as polyamines, toxic bound nitrogen, and ammonia. Lechner and Kronberger[24] have also obser
ved improved tolerance of aggressive conventional treatments in patients who employed Gerson's therapy at the same time. At CHIPSA, the therapy was prescribed for 18 to 36 months, subject to the physician's judgment and pati!

ent response.

<P>This study, because of its retrospective nature, makes no attempt to adjust for variables such as mind-body treatments or adjuvant botanical or homeopathic materials (although it is our impression that such treatments were commonly used). We know of on
ly two cases in which nonsurgical conventional treatments were employed concurrently with the Gerson treatment: 2 stage IVA patients, both 5-year survivors, added adjuvant biological response modifiers (One employed interferon for 6 months, and the other 
used levamisole). Several patients whose disease had escaped surgical management before

admission to the Gerson program required one or more surgeries during treatment.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>DATA COLLECTION</B></FONT>

<P>To begin, we reviewed all records, files, and lists at our disposal from Hospitals La Gloria, La Mesa, Del Sol, CHIPSA, and the Gerson Institute in San Diego. In cases for which original patient phone and address records were no longer valid, we went t
o stored financial charts in which were found records of collect telephone calls placed by patients to friends and relatives. We used those additional numbers with considerable success to locate living patients and to learn the fate of the deceased. We we
re also able to extend our search by employing the epidemiological services of Equifax Credit Information Services. In 1993 the Gerson Research Organization began publishing a free newsletter for current and past patients, who were invited to join a suppo
rt network. They were encouraged to share with all patients, even if they had not been treated by CHIPSA physicians. Through this route, several independently treated patients were discovered, contacts were established with !

their physicians, and data were collected and used in this study.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>LEVELS OF DOCUMENTATION</B></FONT>

<P>Because ours is a groundbreaking effort among various alternative forms of cancer management, we believe that explanation of our documentation process is warranted. Two standards of documentation

were applied: one for survivors and one for deceased patients. 

<P>Forty-five survivor charts were meticulously cataloged to include independent histological verification, previous physicians' notes, surgical summaries, and radiological interpretations. In addition, our own physician notes, extended care consultation 
records, periodic laboratory reports, roentgenograms and scans as well as medication purchase records and other evidence of compliance, were included. Charts for 5 survivors could not be sufficiently cataloged to assess staging at admission, even though t
hey did contain adequate evidence of the presence of melanoma.

<P>For purposes of this evaluation, we operated under two assumptions regarding deceased patients: (1) the majority probably achieved some measure of compliance with the Gerson treatment, and (2) the cause of death for the majority was probably melanoma. 
Mortality data are being assembled to address these assumptions if possible.

<P>In staging the deceased, we allowed less stringent documentation to suffice, with the understanding that the negative outcomes were probably due to melanoma. Fifty-seven charts of deceased patients contained independent confirmation of staging by their
 previous physicians, the standard of evidence required for all survivor charts in this study. In contrast, 44 were staged by relying on the admitting physician's oral history and physical examination. Beyond this, questionnaire responses and corresponden
ce were considered to provide adequate information for 7 patients whose charts could not be located.  

<P>Such lower-level documentation (admission oral history and physical examinations, and the questionnaire responses) was considered acceptable only for charts of deceased patients whose disease had apparently progressed. If we have erred in this judgment
, it was on the side of caution.  Because physicians administering the Gerson cancer therapy did not make exhaustive staging efforts on admission for any of their melanoma patients, the possibility certainly exists that deceased patients may have  develop
ed undetected distant and internal metastases before admission; in fact, this possibility cannot be ruled out for the survivors.  With these criteria, 108 charts of the deceased were assessable for stage at

admission.

<P>Twenty-four charts were missing, presumably destroyed in the La Gloria Hospital fire of 1985 in which approximately 900 charts of all different pathologies were lost. Two cases for which outcomes had been documented (Both were noted deceased in a Gerso
n Institute file index) were identified by initials only, with no gender markers. Survival outcomes are known for 72 women and 81 men; 42 (58%) women and 69 (85%) men are deceased, a finding consistent with the female survival advantage widely reported in
 the melanoma literature. Two deceased men and 1 deceased woman (all stage III) lived 5 or more years and are reflected in this report as 5-year survivors.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>STATISTICAL METHODS</B></FONT>

<P>Charts of 153 patients were assessable for both outcome and stage at admission. Five-year survival rates for each stage were compared with rates previously published by Balch[25], Drepper et al (the American Cancer Society)[26], Ryan et al (the Eastern
 Cooperative Oncology Group)[27], and Fawzy[28].  For most comparisons, we used the chi-square test; when comparing small samples, we employed Fisher's Exact Test. For the above tests, we employed a computer program, SigmaStat, by Jandel Scientific Softwa
re. Programs were created (by SC) to generate Kaplan- Meier survival functions. Survival curves were plotted using Harvard Graphics. Cox regressions and log-rank tests for homogeneity of survival curves were used for comparison of data.

<P><B>Table 1</B>  Staging system used for this report

<P><IMG SRC="table1.gif">



<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>STAGING USED IN THIS REPORT</B></FONT>

<P>Because so many different staging systems exist for nodular and superficial spreading malignant melanoma, we have provided a breakdown of the staging criteria we used in Table 1. We borrowed from current international standards of the TNM (tumor, node,
 metastasis) system for melanoma as published by the American Joint Committee on Cancer[29] as well as the more precise staging divisions for micrometastases as published by the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC), or International Union Against 
Cancer[30]. Both of these methods incorporate Clark levels (tissue invasion) and the Breslow index (tumor thickness).

<P>The recent reclassification of melanoma staging emphasizes micrometastases and has, therefore, caused considerable stage migration. Many melanoma tumors that would previously have been categorized as stage IIB have moved to stage III. Stage III has bee
n expanded and divided into stages IIIA and IIIB. The net effect of this reclassification, from our point of view, is an amplification of the survival benefit of lifestyle management as represented by the Gerson cancer treatment. In this paper, we have pr
esented our findings with a proposed new division of stage IV into two parts. We believe that our findings support this proposal.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>RESULTS</B></FONT>

<P>The primary purpose of our study was to assess survival outcomes as measured by 5-year survival rates by stage, which are summarized in Table 2. Of 249 potential melanoma patients identified from lists and files of the above mentioned organizations, su
rvival outcomes were learned for 196 (79%), whereas 53 (21%) were lost to follow-up. Stage at admission was assessable in 167 cases (85%), whereas in 29 (15%) it was not.

<P><B>Table 2</B>  5-year survival rates by most clinically important disease (TNM)

<P><IMG SRC="table2.gif">

<P>Of 14 patients (8%) who were excluded, 3 did not have malignant melanoma (2 had melanoma in situ, and 1 had a history of melanoma). One case of pediatric melanoma was excluded because of its unique

nature. Ten cases of ocular melanoma (2 surviving, a deceased), which has different staging criteria and is not directly comparable to either nodular melanoma or the superficial spreading type, were also excluded. Superficial and nodular melanoma become c
omparable with the use of Clark levels and the Breslow index[24].

<P>After exclusions, a total of 153 patients were included in this review; 45 (29%) lived at least 5 years (41 of whom were alive at this writing), and 108 (71%) were known to be deceased.  Survival rates within the Gerson system are clearly stage-related
 (Table 3). A log-rank test for homogeneity of Kaplan-Meier survival curves for early (localized) versus late (regionally or distantly metastasized) disease (Figure 1) revealed that the difference was statistically significant (P=.007). However, as will b
e seen below, survival rates for men and women do not differ until distant (beyond the primary lymphatic drainage system- stage IV) metastases have presented.



<P><B>Table 3</B>  Survival rates by stage (percent)

<P><IMG SRC="table3.gif">

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>STAGES I AND II</B></FONT>

<P>Of the 153 patients assessable for stage at admission 14 (9%) entered the Gerson program with early (stage I or II) melanoma. At admission 4 patients were stage IA, 7 were IB, and 3 were stage II. None suffered progression of melanoma after admission; 
all remained free from melanoma for up to 17 years- 13 were alive at this writing; and I was deceased of other causes.

<P>All of the stage I and II patients reviewed were admitted to the Gerson program before May 1987 and were, therefore, included in the assessment of the 5-year survival rate. All of the 14 early stage melanoma patients remained disease-free for a mini- m
um of 7 1/2 years and a maximum of 17 years. No deaths due to melanoma had occurred in this group as of this writing (although a 74-year-old, 15-year stage II survivor died of prostate cancer).  When contrasted with a meta-analysis of 15,798 stage I and I
I melanoma patients from reporting centers worldwide in which Balch[25] found an overall average 5-year survival rate of 79%, the sample size in the Gerson treatment system was too small for statistical significance (chi-squared=2.56, P=.11). The sample w
ould have to in the context of this study's unusually positive findings for stages III and IVA, these data hint that aggressive lifestyle intervention (e.g., Gerson's therapy) may hold a potential to reduce the world- wide 5!

-year mortality rate for early-stage, localized melanoma. Of the early stage patients in Balch's meta-analysis, 21% (more than 3300) were deceased at 5 years.

<P>It is also of interest that stage I and II patients comprised approximately 88% (15,798 of 17,914) of the melanoma cases reported by centers worldwide, whereas physicians offering the Gerson cancer treatment saw only 9% (14 out of 153) at such an early
 and hopeful stage.



<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>STAGE III</B></FONT>

<P>In all, 35 (23%) of the assessable cases were admitted at stage III. The 5-year survival rate for 35 assessable stage III melanoma patients treated with the Gerson diet therapy is 71%, with 10 deceased before the 5-year mark and 25 cancer-free for at l
east 5 years.

<P>The American Cancer Society has reported a 39% 5-year survival rate for stage III melanoma. Other reported 5-year survival rates[25] range from 27% in Brisbane to 42% at Duke University. Interestingly, no center included in Balch's meta-analysis[25], o
ther than Duke University, reported a 5-year survival rate higher than 37%.  

<P>Drepper et al[26], from the Fachklinik Hornheide, reported a 39% 5-year survival rate (n=103) for patients with stage IIIA (N1 only) melanoma. A comparable group from the Gerson system (n=17) achieved an 82% 5-year rate. The comparison (0.43 difference
 in means), which reveals a 110% greater survival advantage for patients in the Gerson system, is statistically significant (chi-squared=9.48 with 1 df, P=.002, power=.887).

<P>The Fachklinik Hornheide also documented a 41% 5-year survival rate for all (n=134) its stage IIIA (T4b and N1) and stage IIIB (N2 patients). Same-stage patients in the Gerson system (n=33) achieved a 5-year survival rate of 70%. The difference in mean
s (.29) is statistically significant (chi-squared=7.62 with 1 df, P<.006, power=.802).



<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>STAGE IVA</B></FONT>

<P>Of the assessable patients, 104 (68%) had a stage tumor at admission. All stage IV survivors in the Gerson program were admitted presenting only superficial metastatic disease (limited to skin, subcutaneous, and lymph involvement) with no internal meta
stases. We believe that these patients represent a responsive subgroup within stage IV, and suggest categorizing such patients separately as stage IVA.

<P>According to Balch, 23% of stage IV patients reported worldwide present first metastases confined to lymph, skin, and subcutaneous tissue (any T, any N, M1). He reports that this group has a median survival of 7.2 months and a 1-year survival rate of 2
5% worldwide. 

<P>Of the stage IV patients admitted to the Gerson program, 18 (17%) were classified M1 (stage IVA); 7 (39%) of 18 were alive at this writing, with a survival range of 5 to 19 years. Therefore, the 5-year survival rate for 18 melanoma patients admitted to
 the Gerson program at stage IVA was 39%.

<P>Ryan et al[27] of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) published an outcomes analysis of 635 advanced-stage melanoma patients in which they offered a breakdown of survival by most significant sites. ECOG showed 11 of 194 patients fitting our s
tage IVA criteria to have lived 5 years, for a 5-year survival rate of 6%27. In contrast, the 5-year survival rate for 7 of 18 stage IVA melanoma patients in the Gerson system was 39% (550%) greater (0.33 difference in mean). This comparison is statistica
lly significant (chi-squared=19.3 with 1 df, P<.0001, power=.997).



<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>STAGE IVB</B></FONT>

<P>We have made no attempt to assess the survival impact of Gerson's cancer therapy in stage IVB. Because there were no exclusion criteria at any of the Gerson treating facilities, we were unable to find a single comparable treatment group moving through 
any other reporting treatment system. Of the 86 patients (56% of the assessable group) admitted to the Gerson program at stage IVB, most had gravely advanced disease. All are deceased, 6 of the deceased were not able to start the Gerson treatment, 6 died 
in the hospital, 1 presented with both melanoma and AIDS, and 14 are known to have had lactate dehydrogenase readings 300% or more above normal at admission. The highest recorded was 3776, or more than 2400% above normal. Major metastases were distributed
 as follows: 26% had brain involvement, 30% had liver tumors, 18% had tumors in abdominal viscera other than the liver, 40% had lung disease, 21% had melanoma in the bone, and 25% exhibited skin tumors.

<P>Only one patient, a female registered nurse originally admitted at stage III, had documented objective radiological evidence of progression to internal (bone) disease (M2, stage IVB) and subsequent complete remission of those lesions. She had been aliv
e and well for 8 years at this writing.



<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>INFLUENCE OF GENDER ON SURVIVAL</B></FONT>

<P>A female survival advantage has been reported widely in the melanoma literature. Although a female survival advantage is seen in the Gerson system (Table 4), male and female 5-year survival rates are not significantly different until stage IVA (distant
 metastases to skin, subcutaneous tissue, and lymph). Male and female survival rates are substantially the same for patients with stage I and II (completely local disease) as well as those with stages IIIA and IIIB (regionally metastasized disease).



<P><B>Table 4</B>  Survival rates by gender (percent)

<P><IMG SRC="table4.gif">

<P>Twelve women and 2 men were admitted with early (stage I and II) melanoma. This shows an unexplained female recruitment bias (6:1) in early-stage patients, which did not occur with any other stage.

<P>Of 35 patients assessed for stage IIIA and IIIB (all primary T4a, primary T4b, N1, and N2) 5-year survival rates, 18 (51%) were male and 17 (49%) were female, a distribution similar to that reported by the Fachklinik Hornheide[26], which had 49% male a
nd 51% female patients. Of those who were cancer-free at 5 years or beyond, 12 were male and 13 were female. Of the deceased, 6 were male and 4 were female.

<P>Comparison of the 67% 5-year survival rate for all stage III men in the Gerson system with the 76% rate for women (0.09 difference in mean) is not statistically significant (Fisher's Exact Test, P=.71). Two of the 12 male 5-year survivors had recurrenc
e of tumors after the 5th year and are deceased. One female 15-year survivor had recurrence of tumors and is deceased. Even at 10 years, although the survival rate for females (63%, n=8) is considerably higher than that for males (50%, n=12), the differen
ce in means (0.13) is not statistically significant (Fisher's Exact Test, P=.49).

<P>Of 18 patients admitted for treatment of stage IVA melanoma, 9 were women and 9 were men. This recruitment pattern, half and half, is consistent with the melanoma literature. Of 7 who survived 5 years, 6 (86%) were female, whereas only 1 (14%) was male
. Although the samples are tiny, the female 5-year survival rate of 67% is statistically significant compared with the male rate of 11% (Fisher's Exact Test, P=.05).

<P>When IVA survival and mortality data are included with data for stages I through IIIB, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for stage I-IVA male versus female patients (Figure 2) are significantly different (P=.004) when log-rank tested for homogeneity ove
r 5 years.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>LIMITATIONS</B></FONT>

<P>It has been repeatedly suggested that patients who use alternative cancer treatments may be different from patients who employ only conventional treatments.  Several differences have been reported by Cassileth et al[31], who found that alternative trea
tment users tended to be white and better educated than those who used only conventional treatments. It remains to be seen whether these or any other influences yet to be discovered can account for the survival advantage observed in the Gerson system. How
ever, at present, we can cite no convincing evidence that patients treated in the Gerson system differed from the comparison groups according to any meaningful prognostic variables.

<P>This report has not accounted for variables such as the role and influence of individual components and various sets of components within the Gerson system. Subsequent to the completion of this report, we have shown two major variables, complementary u
se of surgery and the use of raw veal liver/carrot juice, to be

significantly associated with improved melanoma survival outcomes[17].  Studies of the rationales for modifications made by Gerson over the 30-year course of development of his treatment have led to contemporary modifications[17], creating still more chal
lenges for thorough analysis.

<P>This study is a retrospective analysis and therefore lacks the luster of a randomized clinical trial. However, the authors have made every attempt to verify adherence to therapy (especially by the survivors), to contrast these data with existing data b
anks, and to clearly present the comparisons here.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>DISCUSSION</B></FONT>

<P>No clearly defined mechanism has been identified to account for the survival advantage demonstrated above. Gerson believed that oxidizing enzymes supplied by the raw juices of his diet therapy improved host functions sufficiently to disadvantage malign
ant cells, which he believed produced their energy through fermentative metabolism. This belief was based on the long popular, but now disproven, cancer generalization of Otto Warburg discussed by Ling[32]. The clinical findings of the present study neith
er validate Gerson's Warburg-based rationale nor disprove Gerson's idea of host enhancement to challenge malignancy. 

<P>Gerson also believed, after Tannenbaum[33], that calorie restriction, increased calorie utilization rate, and micronutrient hyperalimentation could favor the tumor-bearing host and suppress development of both primary tumors and metastases. In principl
e, this belief may have withstood the test of time and advances in research[31].

<P>A huge general category of micronutrients, phytochemicals, has become the focus of a great deal of basic cancer and chemo-prevention research. Clearly, Gerson's treatment provides high, and in some cases extraordinary, doses of thousands of phytochemic
als. However, the literature does not yield practical knowledge of the effects of either individual or combined phytochemicals on human cancers.

<P>Cope[39] wrote that Gerson's salt-and-water management for cancer was an approach that probably led to correction of tissue damage syndrome, or cellular edema caused by poisoning, starvation, hypoxia, or physical trauma. He believed that Gerson's somet
imes extraordinary outcomes might have been due, at least in part, to this mechanism.

<P>Although it has been suggested[40] that any benefits conferred by Gerson's cancer therapy may result in greatest part from its psychosocial impact, this question has never been investigated.  It is reasonable that observers assume a mind/body effect, d
ue to the treatment's obvious self-help components and the CHIPSA medical team's active encouragement of family involvement, even during the patient's  hospitalization. Provisions have been made at CHIPSA for inexpensive room and board for companions. Spo
uses and close relatives are often able to stay with the patient in a private room. This accommodation results in a very high level of family and support-community involvement.

<P>Fawzy et al[28] recently provided findings demonstrating the positive impact of psychiatric intervention on the 6-year disease-free survival rate of stage I melanoma patients in his treatment system. In his study 13 of 34 stage I control subjects had m
elanoma recurrences (10 had died at the time of his report), whereas only 7 of 34 test patients had recurrences (3 had died).  Therefore, the 6-year disease-free survival rate for Fawzy's control subjects was 62%, whereas for his test patients it was 79%,
 a rate similar to the one cited by Balch[25]. Comparison with the 100% 6-year disease-free survival of 14 early stage (localized) melanoma patients in the Gerson treatment system shows a 27% greater survival benefit (0.21 difference in mean). However, du
e to the small sample size for Gerson patients, a log-rank test for continuity of survival curves (Figure 3) over the entire study time is below statistical significance, with only 93% confidence (P=.07). Still, especially w!

hen seen in the light of stage IIIA, IIIB and IVA  melanoma patients in the Gerson system, the complete absence of recurrence in the Gerson patients supports the possibility of a potent physiological effect from Gerson's therapy, in addition to its probab
le beneficial psychosocial effect.

<P>During peer review of this paper, a question arose regarding the potential difference between patients we were able to locate and assess versus those who remained lost to follow-up. How might lost-to-follow-up patients have affected the rates?

<P>To address this issue, we compared the current findings with those tabulated[34] in September 1993, at the beginning of our retrospective study. After updating its staging system to match the current report, we found that the 1993 analysis included 44 
patients in stages I-IVA assessable for 5-year survival. The 5-year rates were as follows: Stages I and II = 100% (n=12); Stages IIIA and IIIB = 68% (n=25); Stage IVA = 57% (n=7). The average 5-year survival rate for the entire group was 75%.

<P>Fourteen patients who had been lost to follow-up in 1993 were located and assessed during the last 2 years. Adding those 14 cases, bringing the number of assessable patients to 58, the rates remained substantially the same (with the exception of IVA, i
n which the initial sample size was quite small). The 5-year survival rates including those 14 cases are: Stages I and II = 100% (n=14); Stages IIIA and IIIB = 67% (n=30); Stage IVA = 36% (n=14).  The average 5-year survival rate of the enlarged group was
 67%.

<P>An additional 9 patients who were admitted after August 1988 but before August 1990 became assessable for 5-year survival. With inclusion of those cases, bringing the number of patients to 67, the

rates remained similar: Stages I and II = 100% (n=14); Stages IIIA and IIIB = 71% (n=35); Stage IVA = 39% (n=18). With recently recruited patients, the group's average 5-year survival rate was 69%.

<P>There were no statistically significant differences among the average rates (chi-squared=0.786, power=.109). We believe that the continuity of findings at various stages of the investigation suggests that the current rates are probably reliable, and th
at discovery or recruitment of additional patients, barring the recruitment of substantially greater numbers of stage I and II patients, will probably not alter the average survival rate significantly.  

<P>We were unable to assess a potential survival benefit for stage IVB melanoma patients in this treatment system. While the Gerson treatment provides many clinical benefits to stage IVB melanoma patients with internal metastases who are able to practice 
it, these benefits must be measured with validated "quality-of-life" instruments. Such measurements can be accomplished only through prospective data collection, which is ongoing and will be the subject of future reports. Data on exact date and cause of d
eath are being

pursued by application to the National Center for Health Statistics for use of the National Death Index. We will report findings as they become available.

<P>Clearly, the search for meaningful biological response modifiers, vaccines, and other means of host stimulation may be paramount for the management of advanced melanoma tumors that are internally

metastasized. In fact, any means of relatively safe tumor debulking must be given serious consideration.

<P>This retrospective study is our first (but not our last) effort at assessment of the outcomes of cancer patients moving through the Gerson treatment system.

The longest-surviving melanoma patient in this study has been disease-free for 20 years. Four patients who were alive and disease-free at 5 years (reported alive in this assessment) have died. Three stage III patients died of recurrent melanoma after the 
fifth year (one of them after 16 years). One stage IB patient died after 15 years, of prostate cancer, at age 74. And 41 patients are alive and free from disease.

<P>Although retrospective reviews cannot account for many influences, they clearly can be used to describe aggregate outcomes that can stand on their own for purposes of comparison with other groups and treatment systems, and to further the discussion reg
arding appropriate methods of cancer management.  We encourage those involved with other alternative and complementary methods of cancer management to pursue this route.

<H1>From the Convention Circuit ... We find another of Dr.
Gerson's patients</H1>
<H4>by Charlotte Gerson</H4>
<P>At the end of September, 1996, I had the great pleasure
of visiting the New York Chiropractic College. I was invited
to address the faculty and students, discussing the Gerson
Therapy. The following day, I did the usual lecture and
workshop for the public.I received a warm reception, and
thank the students and faculty for their help. I was deeply
impressed by the magnificent campus, set among rolling green
hills, studded with beautiful, majestic trees. The light,
airy buildings are situated along one of New York's extensive
finger lakes. There is a feeling of peace and beauty, very
conducive to study and meditation.</P>
<P>I received great joy from the testimonial of one of the
members of the audience. This gentleman introduced himself as
the nephew of one of the 50 cases (Case #18) Dr. Gerson
described in <A href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
<I>A Cancer Therapy</I></A>. William Schickel. at age 32 was a
struggling artist with a young family, three small children,
the youngest a baby, and a 22 year old wife. He had been
diagnosed with inoperable, widespread retroperitoneal
lymphoma. Radiation was not an option, and he was literally
sent home with perhaps two months to live. Bill's wife, Mary,
found an article in a magazine on organic gardening in which
she read that Dr. Gerson was curing cancer by diet. Following
a pilgrimage to the shrine of the Blessed Philippine
Duschene, their decision was made: they would go to see Dr.
Gerson in New York City. </P>
<P>They arrived in the spring of 1950 from their home in
Loveland, Ohio. After numerous tests, Dr. Gerson felt that
Bill had perhaps a 30% chance of recovery on the nutritional
therapy. Bill was surprised that, in spite of the quiet
elegance of a Park Avenue office, Dr. Gerson's fees were
&quot;very modest&quot;. Gerson also told Bill that he would
not cure him but that his reactivated defenses, his body
would work to heal him.</P>
<P>Struggling physically and financially to follow this
demanding treatment, but with nothing to lose, Bill reports
that he felt better within a few weeks. He received no other
treatment.Bill writes that in 1983 he looked back on &quot;33
years, eight children, twelve grandchildren, and a wonderful
productive life&quot;. In September, 1996 (46 years after his
prognosis of 'two months'), Bill and his wife Mary beam from
the cover of <I>St. Anthony's Messenger</I>, inside of which
is the inspiring story of Bills activities. He is a famous
artist, designs and builds churches, church art and stained
glass windows, assisted by his sons and daughter Martha in
his art studio. Bill won national honors for his interior
design and artwork for the new St. Mary's Church in St.
Clairsville, Ohio. Some years ago, he also had an art show in
San Diego which I was proud to visit. Now 77, Bill works full
time with his family in his studio. When I spoke to him to
ask permission to publish this story, I could hear the energy
and enthusiasm in his strong voice. His story is copyrighted
and he expects to publish it sometime in the future. </P>
<P>We are grateful to Dr. Gerson for having given this
creative, prolific and talented artist the chance to live a
long, healthy and productive life, and make his quite
significant contribution to the world. </P>

Soy Products Dangerous?</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<H1>Are Soy Products Dangerous?</H1>
<P><B>by Charlotte Gerson</B>, with portions reprinted by
permission of <I>Newlife Magazine</I></P>
<P>A considerable percentage of the world's population is
undernourished or outright starving. For many years,
proteins, preferably from animal sources, have been
considered to be the best and most acceptable source of
nutrients. However, we also know that it takes some 16 pounds
of grains, fed to cows, to produce one pound of meat. In his
book <I>Diet for a New America</I>, author John Robbins
points out that we could easily feed the whole world if
everyone were to become vegetarian. This is an unlikely
scenario in the affluent Western world. So, in order to try
to feed the hungry, we are always looking for new sources of
&quot;good&quot; protein. </P>
<P>Much attention has been focused on the soy bean, a widely
grown legume that fulfills both the requirement for a high
protein food and a widely publicized health advantage: it is
low in fat and devoid of cholesterol! This should make it an
ideal food, but is it safe?</P>
<P>An extensive discussion on the subject written by Sally
W. Fallon, M.A., and Mary G. Enig, Ph.D. appeared in the May
1966 edition of <I>Newlife </I>magazine. Since we have often
been asked by a number of our <I>Gerson Healing
Newsletter</I> readers why Dr. Gerson prohibited soy
products, we should like to report on this thoroughly
researched material.</P>
<P>The authors trace the origin of the soy bean to the
Orient, where it was apparently used during the Chou Dynasty
(1134-246 BCE) as a crop rotation material, for its capacity
of fixing nitrogen in the soil. Soy products did not serve as
food until fermentation techniques were developed. When a
method was developed to make soy into a curd by precipitating
it with calcium sulfate or magnesium sulfate, the use of soy
products started to spread. Fermented soy products, such as
miso and tamari sauce, are apparently less harmful than the
precipitated ones, such as tofu or bean curd. But tofu
accounts for about 90% of the processed soybeans in Asia
today, say the authors. It seems that bean curds as a source
of protein did not come into use until about 700 A.D.</P>
<P>Fallon and Enig state that the &quot;Chinese did not eat
the soybean as they did other legumes, such as lentils,
because the soybean contains large quantities of a number of
harmful substances.&quot; Did the Chinese know this? Perhaps
they did, possibly they observed that disease symptoms
appeared after eating tofu or other cooked soy products.
Among the harmful substances, the authors name &quot;potent
enzyme inhibitors, which block the action of trypsin and
other enzymes needed for protein digestion.&quot; Apparently,
cooking does not deactivate these enzyme inhibitors, and they
can produce serious digestive problems such as reduced
protein digestion, chronic deficiencies in amino acid uptake,
enlargement of the pancreas (in animals) and cancer. </P>
<P>Soy products also contain another chemical, hemaglutinin
which promotes clumping of red blood cells. These clumped red
cells are unable to fully take up oxygen and carry it in the
blood stream to all tissues. Hemaglutinin has also been
observed to act as a growth depressant. Fermentation
deactivates these enzyme inhibitors, or at least reduces the
amounts present.</P>
<P>Soybeans are also high in phytic acids which is present
in the bran of hulls of all seeds. This material blocks the
uptake of essential minerals in the intestinal tract,
including such important ones as calcium, magnesium, iron and
especially zinc. Again, only the process of fermentation will
significantly reduce the phytate content of soy products.
Soybeans have a higher content of phytates than any other
legumes, making them of questionable safety and nutritional
value.</P>
<P>Bearing the above in mind, the authors feel that soy
products consumed with meat have a reduced mineral blocking
effect; however they warn particularly that vegetarians who
eat tofu with the idea that it may act as a protein
substitute, risk severe mineral deficiencies. They also feel
that most people appreciate the problems of calcium,
magnesium and iron deficiencies, but that zinc deficiency
produces some especially serious problems: zinc is needed for
optimal development and function of the brain and nervous
system, aside from its role in the immune system.</P>
<P><B>The profit motive</B>. </P>
<P>The average American has not adopted soy products (tofu,
tempeh, miso) as a principal food. Soy sauce may be the
exception to this rule, even though soy oil is also quite
widely used. About 140 billion pounds of soy beans per year
are grown in the US since the end of W.W.II, and the industry
is looking for new markets. At this time, the major use for
the bean is animal feed, and soy oil is used for hydrogenated
fats, margarine and shortening. New soy products are being
marketed to the growing &quot;health product&quot; consumers:
soy milk, soy baby formula, soy yogurt, soy ice cream, soy
cheese, soy flour for baking, and soy protein as a meat
substitute for the vegetarians. </P>
<P>During the production of soy milk, in order to remove as
much of the trypsin inhibitor as possible, the pur&eacute;ed
beans are soaked in an alkaline solution, then heated to
about 115&#186; C. in a pressure cooker. Unfortunately, even
though most (but not all) of the antinutrients are destroyed,
this processing also denatures the proteins, so the remaining
soy protein is very difficult to digest. The phytate content
remains in soy milk to block the uptake of essential
minerals. Worse, the alkaline soaking solution produces a
carcinogen, lysinealine, and reduces the cystine (an amino
acid) content in the soybean. Without cystine, the protein
complex is virtually useless unless the diet is fortified
with meat, eggs or dairy products, an unlikely situation for
vegetarians. </P>
<P>These problems arising from soy production are not
mentioned on labels, and the public is not aware of
them.&quot;Soy based infant formulas, along with trypsin
inhibitors, contain a high phytate level. Use of soy formula
has caused zinc deficiency in infants. Aluminum content of
soy formula is ten times greater than milk-based formula and
100 times greater than unprocessed milk.&quot; While soy milk
is tried on infants with milk allergies, allergy to soy
products is almost as common. The lack of cholesterol in soy
infant formula could inhibit brain development since
cholesterol is essential for the brain and nervous system.
Chemical additives to soy based foods further add to the
problems. </P>
<P>Soy products are widely distributed in third world
countries, presumably to overcome a protein deficiency in the
diets of starving people. They are also used extensively in
school lunch programs, commercial baked goods, diet beverages
and fast food products. New publicity promotes soy products
for their &quot;cancer preventing properties&quot;. While
traditionally fermented soy products may contain a cancer
preventing chemical, these are contained in an altered state
in non-fermented soy products and have no anti-carcinogenic
effect. On the contrary, it has been suggested that the rapid
increase of liver and pancreatic cancer in Africa is due to
the increased use of soy products.&quot;...to remove oil from
the soy bean, particularly high pressures and temperatures
are required, since this is an unusually difficult process.
Furthermore, hexane or other solvents are always used to
extract oil from soy beans, and traces remain in the
commercial product. But the high temperatures destroy some of
the possible beneficial fatty acid fractions of the soy oil:
the Omega-3's, which are especially susceptible to rancidity
when subjected to high pressures and temperatures.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Claims that the fermented soy products can be
relied on as a source of B12 have not been supported by
scientific research.&quot; Nor do they supply the essential
fat soluble vitamins D and A, needed for the absorption of
all minerals. Unfortunately, soy products increase the
requirements for vitamin B12 and D.</P>
<P>The authors summarize all the above, and possible
arguments that soy products have been used for many centuries
in the Orient, as follows: &quot;traditional fermented soy
products have a long history of use that is generally
beneficial when combined with other elements of the Oriental
diet including rice, sea foods, fish broth and fermented
vegetables. Precipitated (Western) soy products can cause
serious problems, especially when they form the major source
of protein in the diet.&quot; </P>

<H1>The Approaching Era of BSE ... Revenge of the Cannibal
Cows</H1>
<P>by Howard Straus, Editor</P>
<HR><P>There have been many cries of apocalyptic doom over
the last decade, from the hole in the ozone to the global
spread of AIDS, the rising cancer rate or global warming.
Many of these have generated controversies, each side of the
controversy having either a palpable agenda, or a vested
economic interest in the status quo. Meanwhile, governments,
in league with agribusiness have been fashioning a real,
present and current disease through cynicism, incompetence,
lies and shortsighted economic expedience. The result could
soon spell an epidemic that would dwarf cancer, heart disease
and AIDS.</P>
<P>In 1981, the British government relaxed agricultural
regulations regarding what could be fed to livestock,
allowing processed slaughterhouse waste to be fed to
livestock as high protein supplements. That meant that
various parts of sheep, chicken and cows, including brains,
eyes and bones, could be processed, flavored and mixed with
other feeds to cheaply increase the productivity of cattle
farms. Brains of sheep with a disease called scrapie were
included in the list of permitted contents of cattle feed, as
were, incredibly, chicken droppings. The fact that this
practice would turn normally vegetarian animals into
carnivores, even cannibals, was simply ignored, despite
warnings from various concerned scientists, and a Royal
Commission, who were roundly ignored and effectively
pooh-poohed. </P>
<P>The practice was widely adopted in the British cattle
industry, and subsequently led to cheaper beef, a highly
desirable result for the growers, and one that enabled the
British to compete well with the Continental beef producers
in France and Holland. </P>
<P>Suddenly, in 1986, the honeymoon ended. The first case of
a new cattle disease had been diagnosed. It was a bovine form
of the sheep disease scrapie, and was called bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE for short. Its better-known
name, by now, is Mad Cow Disease, because the cows that
contract the disease become aggressive, disoriented, and
generally appear to have gone &quot;mad&quot;. The disease
destroys and kills by literally turning the animals' brains
into sponges by boring holes in brain and nerve tissue.
Though the new disease was reported to the appropriate
authorities in the British government, they did nothing to
alert the general population to the situation for at least
eleven months, when they finally published the finding in an
obscure veterinary journal, unlikely to be seen or noticed by
the general public. Certainly, nothing was done to change the
practice of feeding slaughterhouse offal to cows, sheep,
chickens or pigs.</P>
<P>When the press got a hold of the story, and began raising
questions about the safety of British beef, the organs of
government churned into high gear. Every possible senior
official who had anything to do with public opinion, from the
Prime Minister to the Minister of Food and Farming, assuring
the world that British beef was sound, safe, and that this
disease, which had already made the jump from sheep to
cattle, could not possibly make the jump from cattle to
humans. This despite the fact that virtually nothing was
known for certain about BSE. Any researcher or government
official who did not hue to the party line was rapidly and
effectively silenced and/or &quot;made redundant&quot;, i.
e.: fired.</P>
<P>In 1989, two cases of an atypical strain of
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD) were diagnosed, a strain
which was alarmingly similar in effect and area of the brain
attacked to BSE. Rare instances of this disease had been
recorded as far back as 1965. Britain's trading partners
began making noises about quarantining British beef, as the
European Economic Community (EEC) had already done to
American beef (antibiotic residues are so high that American
beef is considered &quot;tainted&quot; by the EEC). Still
knowing nothing about the cause of the disease, and having no
&quot;scientific&quot; proof one way or another, the British
government continued its public relations campaign to
convince the world that British beef was sound. How could
they guarantee the health of every cow in the British Isles?
Advertising and governmental gobbledegook would have to do
the trick. The idea that someone might actually have to be
held accountable for an incipient and deadly epidemic was
simply unthinkable. Still, nothing was done to halt the
practice of feeding cows to cows.</P>
<P>The epidemic started to grow. At first, only older people
were affected. Many cases of CJD were probably misdiagnosed,
since the symptoms in humans are very similar to those of
Alzheimer's' Disease. In fact, at least one victim's wife,
convinced that her husband had died of CJD rather than the
diagnosed Alzheimer's, repeatedly demanded an autopsy before
her husband's body was cremated. She was unable to prevent
the cremation, and the autopsy was never done. Another
victim's mother, going public to save other mothers the agony
of watching their own teenagers sicken and die, was told to
think of the economic havoc she was causing. It appeared that
CJD had an incubation period of between ten and twenty years,
and nobody could prove that it was transmitted via cows and
the consumption of animal flesh. Experiments done by the
British government themselves showed that, contrary to the
authorities' statements, monkeys, and by extension, probably
humans were capable of contracting the disease from cattle.
Yet, the spin doctors managed to turn even these experiments
into encouraging news! Not until 1988 were any limits put
onto the amounts, types and health of the offal going into
cattle feed, and then they were inadequate and sloppily
enforced by a government far more responsive (as usual) to
the short-term economic interests of the farmers and commerce
than to the health and survival of its individual citizens.
It was a further two years before controls were put on
feeding infected offal to poultry, whose droppings, remember,
were still being fed to the cattle. Only on March 20, 1996,
after teenagers, some as young as 15 and 16 years old, began
to die of a much faster moving strain of the disease, one
with an incubation time of five to ten years, did the
government finally admit that BSE was the &quot;most
likely&quot; cause of the recent outbreak of CJD, publicly
eating their own words.</P>
<P>On March 26, 1996, the rest of Continental Europe, led by
Germany, put a quarantine on all British beef and beef
products. Russia even embargoed British milk and leather. The
British government has very belatedly instituted a program of
cattle destruction, hoping to limit the damage and restore
confidence in farming practices and the health of the British
cattle herd, numbering in the millions of animals. The
practice of feeding infected offal to the remaining animals
has been discontinued. But the death toll from the new strain
of CJD continues to rise, and the victims are otherwise
healthy teenagers and young adults.</P>
<P>The problems, of course, are very complex. In Iceland,
when the related sheep disease scrapie was found to be
infecting a large proportion of the sheep, every sheep in
Iceland was slaughtered and disposed of, and the entire herd
was replaced by importing healthy animals from abroad. Within
a few years, however, the new herd was infected again. The
only possible means of transmission of the disease from the
sheep that no longer existed to the new, healthy sheep, was
that the ground was infected, and the new sheep could be
infected from the urine and droppings of the old sheep. The
latest understanding of this disease is that it is not
transmitted by a virus or microbe, but by a tiny protein
fraction (called a prion) that is virtually indestructible by
sterilization, acids, heat or burial in soil. This has
chilling implications for the British, who, until recently,
have been burying large numbers of slaughtered, infected cows
and sheep in farms and landfills, many near rivers and
municipal water sources. There is no way to remove these
sources of infection from the ground, as the products of
decay have, by now, spread far and wide, both from urine and
cattle droppings, and from the buried animals. The disease
causes no immune response, and there is no known treatment
for it, much less cure.</P>
<P>Often, when a farmer begins to see the first symptoms of
a BSE-infected animal, economics dictate that he is better
off to kill and bury the animal on his farm than to admit
that his farm is no longer BSE-free, or even better, send the
animal to the slaughterhouse before the animal becomes
clinically ill and has to be destroyed. Although the
government will pay him to destroy and incinerate the
carcass, animals from &quot;BSE-free&quot; farms fetch higher
prices than those from farms admitting the problem.
Unfortunately, this gives farmers large economic incentive to
misrepresent the status of their farms. Some farmers have
already been fined for falsely representing their farms as
BSE-free, others have, most likely, escaped detection.</P>
<P>By May, 1990, a quarter of the population of Great
Britain refused to eat beef. In six months, beef prices
dropped 10-25%, devastating the cattle industry. Cats and zoo
animals are now dying regularly from their own variants of
spongiform encephalopathy; over 160,000 British cattle have
already succumbed to it. To date, there is still no
well-defined, strictly implemented program for keeping
infected offal from infecting healthy meat in Great
Britain.</P>
<P>That's England, though, isn't it?</P>
<P>&quot;What does this have to do with the United
States?&quot; you may be asking. &quot;We have been assured
that there is no BSE problem here. We don't import British
beef, do we?&quot; Well, no, we don't, and haven't since
1989. But what we do continue here is the practice, now
banned in Great Britain, of feeding processed slaughterhouse
waste to cows, chickens and pigs as low cost, high-protein
feed supplementation. This is the very practice that got the
British cattle industry in such bad trouble so very quickly a
decade and a half ago: feeding cows to cows. In 1991, the
USDA considered a mandatory ban on the practice. But
according to an internal USDA document, the agency dismissed
the ban because, &quot;the cost to the livestock and
rendering industries would be substantial.&quot; (Sound like
Britain's initial response?) </P>
<P>We certainly have the problem of scrapie in America, and
it is known to have jumped the species barrier from sheep to
the cattle herd. Scrapie manifests itself in cattle as the
animal falling down, and being unable to rise again. There is
the possibility, even the likelihood of an outbreak of BSE
and its associated human form, CJD occurring in the United
States. It may already have arrived here, and been missed in
the background noise of the enormous human tragedy of our
epidemic of Alzheimer's disease. It is quite possible that
many cases of CJD have been misdiagnosed here as Alzheimer's,
disguising the onset of the epidemic by not recognizing it
for what it is, and giving us a false sense of security. In
fact, there is good evidence that BSE has been in the United
States since the mid-'70s.</P>
<P>What is even worse is that it is not just beef that is
affected. By now, slaughterhouse workers, farmers and food
preparation workers have died of CJD, possibly from the
constant contact with animal blood and offal. The ground on
which the cattle have been urinating and defecating is
certainly infected, and we know that the vector survives in
the ground for long periods of time. We know little about the
effects of the disease or its vectors on other animals fed
infected offal, such as chickens and pigs. And we must assume
that milk and other animal products, like gelatin and dairy
products, and anything that contains them, are possibly
infectious. Think about that, for a moment. Substitute the
more familiar but less likely disease &quot;AIDS&quot;, and
imagine being at risk for infection from a milk chocolate bar
or a cold remedy in a gelatin capsule, the egg, butter or
milk in a piece of birthday cake, a cup of nonfat yogurt or
cottage cheese, and you will begin to understand how deeply
the malpractice of the food-animal industry has endangered
your life and the lives of your family. </P>
<P>&quot;The critical uncertainty,&quot; to quote an article
from the Internet by Michael Greger, &quot;is, how small a
dose is necessary to pass the disease along? Theoretically,
it doesn't matter if BSE can infect humans if we never eat
enough meat within a lifetime. Last year, calculations were
made to determine how many people will have consumed a
potentially infectious dose by 1997. The conservative
estimate runs upwards of 34 million people. In other words,
virtually a whole generation of people may die. And we are
not talking about a quick and simple death, either. If we
assume the disease runs a course similar to CJD, these people
will wake up one morning twitching and deteriorate weekly
into blindness and epilepsy, while their brain perforates
into a sponge. If they're lucky, they will be dead within
three months; if not, it may take up to five years.&quot;</P>
<P>This disease has the potential to be far more widespread
and deadly than AIDS or cancer, than heart disease or stroke.
And we don't know we have it until it is far, far too late to
do anything about, not to mention the fact that there is, at
the moment, nothing we can do about it. Americans' trust in
our own government has already fallen to such a low level
that we rarely believe its self-serving, exculpatory
statements. We must now, however, find a way to let the
government know, in no uncertain terms, that we are outraged
at the suicidal behavior of the factory farming industry and
of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, which is charged with
the often contradictory tasks of regulating and promoting
American agriculture. </P>
<P>Though we, as Gerson Persons, are basically vegetarians,
the practice of making vegetarian animals into cannibals puts
us all at risk from the most apparently innocuous substances,
and from contaminated water that cannot be purified short of
expensive steam distillation. We must force our governmental
organs to be responsive to our health and safety, and soon,
if we are not to fall victims en masse to the same fate as so
many Britons have already. We must fight for our survival
against our own food suppliers, and against our own
government, against the very institutions we want to believe
are protecting us. We know the results of trusting the FDA
and the NCI to help us. </P>
<P>This one, however, is a battle we cannot afford to lose.

<H2>Cure of Small Cell Lung Cancer</H2>
<B>Patient Story: William Hetzler</B>
<A HREF ="chemo101.htm"></A>
<P>by Charlotte Gerson
<p><IMG SRC="banner2.gif" alt="*">
<P>We rarely see patients with "small cell" (or oat cell) type of lung
cancer.  <I>Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment</I>, Krupp and Chatton,
1993 says that lung cancer patients, in general, have an 8% chance of
surviving 5 years.  However, the small cell anaplastic (oat cell)
types have the worst prognosis.  "It metastasizes early and widely,
and is not amenable to surgery."  In his monograph Chemotherapy of
Advanced Epithelial Cancer, physician and biostatistician Dr. Ulrich
Abel wrote that "small cell lung cancer is the only carcinoma for
which good direct evidence of a survival improvement by chemotherapy
exists."  But this improvement amounts to a matter of three months!

<P>In late February of 1993, William Hetzler, then 55 years old, arrived
at the <a href="center.html"> hospital</a>.  He had been diagnosed and biopsied at the
Long Beach Hospital on Long Island, (New York).  He subsequently
consulted a pulmonary specialist at the North Shore Hospital, also on
Long Island, for a second opinion .  He was advised to transfer
immediately to the oncology department for chemotherapy.  He was told
that without chemotherapy, he might have 3-4 months survival.  

<P>A cousin of his in Oregon where he runs an organic farm told him to
call the Gerson Institute for information on nutritional healing.
Given some hope, he came to Mexico.  He now admits that he was deeply
depressed and had periods of crying while at the <a href="center.html"> hospital</a>.
However, by the time he left, he had become hopeful.  

<P>In August of 1993, while we were at a Convention in New York, William
attended, mostly in order to testify about his experience.  At that
time, only about 6 months after he arrived at the <a href="center.html">hospital</a> in "terminal"
condition, he reported that his latest chest X-ray showed his lungs
to be clear of cancer.  He carried on with the strict Gerson Therapy
for two years.  It is now over two years and he is well, planning a
business trip to Europe.  He says that he now "sleeps to heal," and
remains on the modified Gerson Therapy.  He told me that he took
shark cartilage all through his therapy.  He doesn't want to go back
to his original oncologist.  "All the sick people there depress me,"
he said.

<H4>From Charlotte Gerson's Clinical Notebook, Healing
Newsletter Vol. 10, No. 4</H4>
<H1>Answers to Some Frequently Asked Questions</H1>
<P>by Charlotte Gerson</P>
<HR><P>In his last book, <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
 A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases</A>, Dr. Max Gerson
incorporated the experiences, trials and errors of a
lifetime. He especially needed to record the details of his
work with advanced and terminal cancer patients. For these
patients he had to fine-tune his therapy to the ultimate
degree, to obtain the best foods and juice extraction, the
most carefully adjusted medications, and the most thorough
detoxification. He did this with very specific directions:
how to do the enemas, how best to extract the juices, and so
forth. Over the years, various authors have proposed their
own ideas in the above areas, often differing from Dr.
Gerson's. This has naturally raised questions for patients
using the Therapy, as well as others interested in the theory
and practice of the Gerson Therapy. I would like to explain
some of the reasons underlying Dr. Gerson's detailed
instructions in these areas. </P>
<P><A href="ref.html#juicer">
Juicers </A> </P>
<P>The juicing is so tedious, with all the grinding and
pressing. Isn't there an easier and faster way, or a cheaper
juicer that I could use? </P>
<P>Dr. Gerson said in his address to a group assembled in
Escondido, California in 1956 (Appendix II, p. 406, <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy</A>): &quot;At first I thought that
liquefiers would be the most wonderful thing. All the
material was there, nothing was lost. But it didn't
work.&quot; The rotating blade gives rise to a &quot;dynamo
effect&quot;, causing electricity to be generated, and
killing enzymes. The same is true for centrifugal juicers.
Juices must be made by grinding the vegetables first, mixing
them, and then pressing them in a press. We have recently
come across cancer patients who tried to heal themselves on
the Gerson Therapy using a centrifugal juicer. They
experienced no improvement. When they tried the Therapy with
Champion juicers, they did well. The more seriously ill
patients still need the grinding plus pressing type of juicer
arrangement to properly heal. </P>
<P>In response to a question from a patient about the two
step juicing process, Dr. Gerson wrote that &quot;the malic
acid (contained in the apples) mixed with the ground carrots
helps to release the minerals from the carrots.&quot; In
other words, it is necessary to first grind the apples and
carrots together into a bowl, using a grinder. The Norwalk,
K&amp;K or Champion juicers can be used as grinders, but the
Champion cannot be used as a press. The ground materials are
mixed in the bowl, the mixture is placed in a press cloth and
put under pressure in the Norwalk or K&amp;K press. This
process produces the best extraction, richest in minerals,
and the tastiest juice. Juice produced by the Champion juicer
alone separates into a transparent liquid at the bottom and
mush on top after a very short time. This juice is harder for
the patient to drink because of the particles, and is not as
rich and homogeneous in nutrients. </P>
<P>Recently the Green Power juicer was introduced. It does a
better job of extraction than the Champion alone used as a
juicer. But it offers no way (as the Champion does) to block
the juicing action. It is impossible to use the Green Power
juicer as a grinder only, it grinds and juices in one
operation. While it extracts juice quite efficiently, it does
not fulfill Dr. Gerson's requirement of mixing the ground
apples and carrots thoroughly before pressing. </P>
<P><A href="ref.html#coffee">
Enemas </A> </P>
<P>I thought that high colonics cleaned out the entire
colon. Why shouldn't one do high colonics? Aren't we trying
to clear out the colon? </P>
<P>Anyone who is at all familiar with the Gerson Therapy is
well aware of the utmost importance of the coffee enemas.
(Gerson Healing Newsletter #13, May, 1986). But questions
arise from Dr. Gerson's instructions, specifically his
warning: NO HIGH COLONICS. High colonics don't accomplish
what coffee enemas do, namely, open the liver/bile ducts to
allow the liver to release toxins. They also interfere with
basic colonic functions: reabsorption of nutrients, vitamins
and fluids, especially when used regularly. </P>
<P>Let us first examine the basics. Dr. Gerson found that
the underlying problems of all cancer patients are toxicity
and deficiency. He had to overcome both these difficulties.
He found that one of the important features of his therapy
had to be the hourly administration of fresh vegetable
juices. These supply ample nutrients, as well as fluids to
help flush out the kidneys. When the high levels of nutrients
re-enter tissues, toxins accumulated over many years are
forced into the blood stream. The toxins are then filtered
out by the liver. The liver is easily overburdened by the
continuous release of toxins and is unable to release the
load. This can cause liver damage, even liver coma -- unless
the liver is helped to release the overload. Dr. Gerson found
that he could provide help to the liver by the caffeine in
coffee, absorbed from the colon via the hemorrhoidal vein,
which carries the caffeine to the portal system and then to
the liver. The caffeine stimulates the liver/bile ducts to
open, releasing the poisons into the intestinal tract for
excretion. </P>
<P>High colonics are usually not done with coffee, and
therefore do not benefit the liver. Even if coffee were to be
used, a high colonic forces it high into the transverse and
ascending colon, where it is not absorbed into the portal
system. </P>
<P>With the constant administration of vegetable juices of
the Gerson Therapy, a flood of toxins is steadily released
from the poisoned cells in the body. Four to five coffee
enemas daily are needed to help continuously unburden the
liver, and deal with the toxins. It would be impossible, even
dangerous, to do five high colonics daily. </P>
<P>Colonics have another undesirable effect. The colon is a
very important recycling organ which reabsorbs fluids,
enzymes and minerals. It also produces some vitamins with the
help of friendly bacteria. Regular high colonics disturb this
activity, flushing out essential minerals, enzymes and
friendly bacteria along with the waste materials. This could
lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (washing out
too many of the minerals the body needs). </P>
<P>If a patient wishes to use one or two high colonics prior
to starting the Gerson Therapy, we have no objection. But the
often-suggested course of 15 or 30 colonics should not be
undertaken. In addition, it is possible to stretch the colon
and lose some of its normal muscle function. </P>
<P>Most doctors and nurses are taught to have the patient
lie on the left side to take their enemas. Dr. Gerson wanted
the patient to lie on his right side. With the patient in
this position, gravity will help the coffee flow past the
descending colon, just around the &quot;corner&quot; of the
splenic flexure, and into the transverse colon for higher
penetration and better release of toxic feces. </P>
<P>One more important note: When using the castor oil enema,
it is necessary to add some soap to the coffee/castor oil
solution so the oil does not float to the top. Do not grate
soap into the solution. Too much soap will irritate and
inflame the colon. Just rub a cake of soap for a few moments
with your hand immersed in the (liquid) coffee. This will
release enough soap to do the job. </P>
<P><A href="ref.html#flaxoil">
Flax Seed Oil </A> </P>
<P>Dr. Gerson strongly prohibited any fats or oils, yet <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy</A> says to use flax seed oil. What is the
source of this contradiction? </P>
<P>Dr. Gerson was very much aware that patients require the
intake of essential fatty acids. He experimented with various
substances, including sunflower, safflower, olive and other
oils to try to satisfy this need. He even tried fresh,
unsalted butter. In all cases, fats administered to patients,
even after they were already free of tumor tissue, caused the
regrowth of cancers. Therefore, Dr. Gerson stated repeatedly
and emphatically when describing the practice of the Therapy
&quot;NO OILS, NO FATS.&quot; </P>
<P>In 1958, after his book had been published, Gerson found
the work of Dr. Johanna Budwig. Dr. Budwig described her
successful use of flax seed oil (linseed oil) in cancer
patients. Dr. Gerson tried this substance and found it very
beneficial. It supplies the essential fatty acids, helps to
carry Vitamin A through the blood stream and supplies
linoleic and linolenic acids. </P>
<P>In a letter to his long-time friend, Dr. Albert
Schweitzer, Gerson described his protocol for the use of Flax
Seed Oil: two tablespoons a day for the first month on the
Gerson Therapy; one tablespoon thereafter. This prescription
seems to be in conflict with Dr. Gerson's injunction of NO
OILS, NO FATS. In the charts on pp. 235 and 236 of <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy</A>, the reader will find that the use of
flax seed oil is described. The reason for the
&quot;contradiction&quot; is that, on the basis of Dr.
Gerson's research in the last year of his practice, we added
the flax seed oil prescription. We did not change the text in
the book prohibiting all fats and oils, because we wanted to
keep Dr. Gerson's original words as intact as possible. We
hope that this explains any apparent contradictions the
reader may find. </P>
<P>Flax seed oil is made from organic flax seed, cold
pressed, bottled in a light-tight container, and sealed in
the presence of inert gas, not air. This careful handling
keeps the oil from oxidizing, and becoming rancid. It must
never be heated, and should never be used to cook, bake or
fry anything. Unopened bottles may be stored in a freezer for
up to six months; in a refrigerator for up to three months.
Once opened and exposed to air, still refrigerated, the oil
is only usable for three weeks. </P>
<P>Patients should use the <A href="ref.html#flaxoil">
golden, filtered oil </A>, not the brownish and viscous
material that includes lignins. The lignins come from part of
the fiber of the seed, which also contains certain
undesirable proteins. These should be avoided. Also, when
used by patients, only the oil should be taken, not freshly
ground flax seeds, for the same reason. Some patients have
been told by well-meaning friends that lignins or flax powder
can be used and added to cakes. That is totally out of the
question. </P>
<P><B>&quot;Medical Hell&quot;</B> </P>
<P>At the end of May, 1995, a patient was admitted to the
therapy <A href="center.html">
hospital </A> suffering from pancreatic cancer. Patients are
requested to bring their medical records with them, and this
patient brought his doctor's consultation and operation
(biopsy) report along. This young man is only 38 years old,
and has a fairly healthy lifestyle. I do not understand why
he has such a serious problem at this early age. He gave me a
copy of his medical report and, I must admit, I read it in
amazement and disbelief. Since it is so incredible, I am
quoting two paragraphs here exactly as they appear on the
report. </P>
<P>&quot;I have explained to the patient the absence of
surgical resolution of the problem [inoperable] and he will
be seen by the Cancer Clinic and we'll discuss the role or
non-role of chemo and radiotherapy in this condition. The
gravity of his illness was explained to him. At the moment,
he's in a state of denial and shock, but certainly his father
[who is an MD] and wife are well aware of the seriousness of
the situation. </P>
<P>&quot;This man was informed of the diagnosis in the
absence of all involved regular physicians by one of the
family physicians covering for Dr. D. D. in Campbell River.
This at least prepared him for the descent into hell of
having the diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas that he is now
embarked upon ...&quot; </P>
<P>We have seen a number of patients showing total
recoveries from pancreatic cancer, even when it has spread to
the bile duct, spleen, or further. We are often accused of
quackery and &quot;giving desperately ill people false
hope.&quot; Even if our patients do not all recover, we do
give them hope, not false hope, rather than despair. Is the
above medical report an example of compassionate &quot;health
care&quot; providers? <IMG SRC="banner2.gif" alt="*">

<br>Are your teeth killing you?</b></font></center>

<p>Many of our patients and readers are well-informed about the dangers

of "silver-amalgam" fillings.  These commonly-used fillings consist

of more than 51% mercury mixed with silver and some other metals.

The problem, of course, is mercury - a highly toxic heavy metal

with a powerful effect on the nervous system.  Once installed in

teeth, some of the mercury leaches out into the system and into

circulation.  Some people, admittedly, are a great deal more

sensitive to this circulating mercury than others.  Mercury has been

shown to even cause multiple sclerosis in some patients.  When the

"silver fillings" were removed, the patients recovered.  Other people

have silver fillings in their teeth for many years with no apparent

problems.



<p>What is less well-known is the condition that occurs when the root of

a tooth becomes abscessed.  In order to treat the infection, the

dentist first removes any loose or diseased material from the canal

that houses the nerve.  When the nerve is removed, the tooth dies.

Root Canal Cover-Up by Dr. George E. Meinig, D.D.S., F.A.C.D. in 1993

documents the extensive and detailed research done by Dr. Weston A.

Price, D.D.S., F.A.C.D., in the first few decades of this century.

Dr. Meinig founded, and for many years headed The Association of Root

Canal Specialists, a group of dentists engaged in performing root

canal procedures.  He admits to doing many hundreds himself.

However, when he discovered the research done by Dr.  Price detailing

the dangers inherent in this treatment, he resigned his position and

now spends his time and energies in making the public, as well as

professionals, aware of the research.



<p>Dr. Price's first indication of health problems due to root canals

came from a patient who was bedfast and virtually paralyzed by

rheumatoid arthritis.  For some reason, her root canal filled tooth

was removed, although it looked healthy and normal on X-rays. Within

a few weeks the patient was able to get up; after some months, she

was able to walk and her health was totally restored.  Intrigued, Dr.

Price took the extracted tooth, sterilized it thoroughly, and

implanted it under the skin of a rabbit.  Within five days, the

rabbit developed severe rheumatoid arthritis; in ten days it died of

the disease.



<p>Dr. Price subsequently repeated the experiment with many other

patients who had root canal filled teeth extracted, some suffering

from kidney disease, others from heart disease, and many more with

arthritis.  In virtually all cases, the patients showed considerable

improvement, and some even total recovery after the offending teeth

were removed.  Often, Dr. Price implanted the extracted and

sterilized teeth under the skin of rabbits.  In each case, a tooth

removed from the patient caused the patient's disease in the rabbit.

Dr. Price went even further to try to clear the apparently infectious

material from the extracted teeth: he autoclaved them (sterilized by

steam pressure, usually at 250 degrees F. or 121 degrees C.).

Sterilization made no difference: the rabbits with the sterilized

teeth implanted still developed the diseases and died, usually within

ten days.  As a control, Dr. Price implanted a healthy tooth under

the skin of a rabbit.  This rabbit lived without showing any signs of

disease for its normal life span of about 15 years.  



<p>The underlying problem is very interesting: when the nerve is removed

from a tooth, the tooth is dead, and is no longer supplied with

nutrients.  The normal structure of a tooth includes tiny "canules"

(similar to capillaries in all human tissue) that carry nutrients to

the living tooth.  The tooth's constant circulation is also

instrumental in clearing potentially infectious material from the

tooth.  Once the tooth is dead, however, nutrients stop circulating

through these canules, and the tooth loses its ability to clear

itself of infection.  Instead the canules become infested with germs

and viruses.  Additionally, the filling of the nerve canal shrinks a

little bit over time, allowing still more bacteria and viruses to

lodge in the gap between the filling and the tooth.  None of this is

visible on X-rays.  A dead tooth is thus a potent source of bacterial

and viral toxins and infections that can spread throughout the

system.  Inability of sterilization under extreme conditions to clear

the infectious material should prove that, no matter how good one's

dental hygiene is, it is simply impossible to remove the danger.  



<p>People with good immune systems and powerful defenses can often live

with this constant trouble source without developing symptoms.  Yet,

careful X-rays eventually show "cavitation" (hollowing out of the

surrounding jawbone) around the root canal treated teeth.  As the

hitherto resistant patient ages or is weakened by accidents, colds

and flus or severe stress, his ability to overcome this "focal

infection" is reduced.  The infection is then able to cause or

contribute to the development of severe chronic disease.



<p>In view of the above, it will not come as a surprise that we urgently

suggest that patients remove any teeth with root canal fillings.



<p>In the 1950's, German physician Dr. Josef Issels heard a lecture by

Dr. Gerson, and subsequently successfully used alternative treatments

in helping many cancer patients.  Dr. Issels himself spent some time

at the CHIPSA hospital, and, while there, pointed out the severe

damage caused by root canal fillings.  He said that he refused to

treat any cancer patient who did not allow all "devitalized" (dead)

teeth to be removed, as he found that he could not obtain good

results without this procedure.  



<p><center><b>Infected tonsils also cause problems</b></center>



<p>We had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Issels again recently, at a

convention in Orlando that we were both attending.  In the course of

our discussion, he returned to the question of "devitalized" teeth,

and described a simple, infrared machine that is capable of detecting

the infections.  He told us that the detector is also capable of

finding infected tonsils.  



<p>Dr. Issels estimated that approximately 90% of cancer patients have

undetected infections in their tonsils that cannot be found during

routine examinations.  He told us of the case of a patient whose

tonsils Issels insisted needed to be removed.  The surgeon was

doubtful about the necessity of the procedure, because he could not

find any reason for the tonsillectomy.  After the tonsil was out, the

surgeon wanted to prove to Issels that the removed tonsil was

perfectly sound, and cut into it.  He was shocked to have the pus

virtually squirt out into his face.



<p>Dr. Issels was making the following point: it is difficult to

determine that teeth and/or tonsils are infected and are

significantly contributing to the patient's illness.  Every effort

should be made to clear these foci of infection by removing root

canal filled teeth and damaged tonsils, to ensure the maximum chance

of recovery.



<p>Root Canal Cover-Up by Dr. George E. Meinig, D.D.S., F.A.C.D, $19.95,

plus $3.00 postage and handling, is available from the Gerson

Institute.  California residents, please add 7.5% sales tax.

<H2>The Cure and Prevention of Diabetes</H2>
<P><B>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson
Institute</B> </P>
<P><IMG SRC="banner1.gif" alt="*">
 </P>
<P>In order to simplify the discussion of diabetes, we will
divide the subject into two sections: Juvenile Diabetes and
Age Onset Diabetes. Due to its causes, age onset diabetes is
relatively simple and easy to overcome with the Gerson
Therapy. It has been shown that many patients with age onset
diabetes actually produce adequate amounts of insulin, as is
evidenced in their blood. Yet they are not able to properly
assimilate and burn sugar at the cellular level to produce
energy. Instead, diabetics often excrete sugar in the urine,
are thirsty and drink excessive amounts of water, and lack
energy. Since these patients have insulin in their blood, why
are they diabetic? The problem is that the available insulin
in the bloodstream is not being used by the body to
metabolize the sugar. In order to perform its function,
insulin must enter the individual cell and reach the cell's
insulin receptors. In diabetics, insulin receptors are
blocked or clogged with cholesterol, so the insulin is unable
to do its job. So age-onset diabetes is really a cholesterol
problem, not one of sugar, or even malfunction of the
pancreas (which produces insulin in the Islets of
Langerhans). </P>
<P>Since no animal products are used, the Gerson Therapy is
totally devoid of cholesterol. At the <A href="center.html">
hospital</A> facility where the Gerson Therapy is
administered, we have seen blood cholesterol levels drop
dramatically, in some patients, up to 100 points in just one
week on the therapy without cholesterol-reducing drugs. If
the uptake of insulin is blocked by cholesterol, then it
could be expected that this dramatic reduction in serum
cholesterol levels would result in an almost immediate
reduction of the requirement for insulin supplementation. In
fact, it does. One patient, who also suffered from
metastasized melanoma in the liver, had a fasting blood sugar
level of 177 on entering the <A href="center.html">
Gerson hospital</A> (the normal level is 120 or below). In
two days, this level dropped to 120 - without insulin. In one
particularly dramatic case, we saw a diabetic patient, age
46, with sugar levels in his bloodstream of over 200, that
were uncontrollable with insulin and drugs. This problem
completely cleared in five weeks. At that time, he was able
to take all the juices of the full Gerson Therapy (carrot
juices contain large amounts of complex carbohydrates)
without any further need of insulin. His blood sugar level
returned to a normal 120, and remained stable. </P>
<H2>Juvenile Diabetes</H2>
<P>Juvenile diabetes presents entirely different problems.
In juvenile diabetes, as opposed to age-onset diabetes, we
are dealing with true insulin deficiency, damage to the
Islets of Langerhans (the gland clusters in the pancreas that
produce insulin). According to an article some years ago, in
Scientific American, juvenile diabetes is most commonly
diagnosed in children after a severe, long lasting 'flu' that
doesn't seem to yield to normal treatment. This, it turns
out, was not a flu, but pancreatitis; an infection and
inflammation of the pancreas, resulting in damage to the
Islets of Langerhans, and the subsequent diabetes. A few days
ago, I had a call from a distraught parent who is trying to
deal with two children, girls aged 6 and 10, both afflicted
with juvenile diabetes. He did not comprehend the true cause
of his children's disease and the progression of their
problems, starting in early infancy, that led to diabetes. I
have talked to many parents and can usually reconstruct what
happened. The children are immune deficient from birth. This
deficiency is aggravated by immunizations, but it is also
due, in large part, to the mother's poor nutrition, one
lacking in essential nutrients. </P>
<P>These already deficient babies are generally not
breast-fed, but instead receive artificial canned, jarred,
and processed milk and baby foods. The resulting lack of
nutrients adds to the original immune deficiency, and
manifests as a progression of infections, colds and flu. The
child is now plied with drugs, including antibiotics and
various flu medicines. Drugs will temporarily suppress the
infections (in the above case, constant ear infections) but
will not strengthen the immune system. On the contrary, all
antibiotics are toxic to some extent and suppress the immune
system further. So the infections become more frequent and
more severe - until, one day, they become a full fledged
pancreatitis. Not long after that, the child is diagnosed
with juvenile diabetes. </P>
<P>We need to consider another point: the liver and the
pancreas, since they are such extremely important organs,
have their own immune systems, the reticulo-endothelial
system. If hepatitis or pancreatitis occurs, this alone
proves that the affected organ's immune system is severely
damaged. The weakening of the immune system is caused
partially by frequent doses of antibiotics and/or other
medical drugs - all of which are more or less liver toxic.
But once a child develops diabetes and begins taking insulin,
this does not overcome the immune weakness. On the contrary,
the infections continue and require more and more drug
suppression. Insulin does not produce healing! </P>
<P>For many people who have never dealt with the problem,
diabetes seems like a mild illness, easily overcome with
insulin injections. That is unfortunately not true. Juvenile
diabetes often results in kidney damage, with resulting need
for kidney dialysis. Many of the children afflicted with this
disease, as they go into early adulthood, are subject to
retinal damage which can result in blindness. Young adults
whose kidneys no longer function require kidney dialysis and
eventually kidney transplants - which are only good for a few
years and then fail with deplorable results. </P>
<P>In age-onset diabetics, the doctor's suggestion to avoid
starches and sugars and eat more proteins produces other
serious problems. As we have seen above, this disease is
largely due to excess cholesterol. But the recommendation of
&quot;a high protein diet&quot; is understood by most
patients to mean that they should eat largely animal
products. Meat, chicken, fish, cheese, eggs and milk are very
high in cholesterol, the very cause of the problem. The
result for most of these patients is that more serious
cholesterol problems develop: deposits in the arteries
leading to high blood pressure, heart disease and heart
attacks; poor circulation with resulting gangrene. Gangrenous
toes, feet and legs often must be amputated. Retinal
detachment problems lead to blindness. </P>
<P>Most of the problem is the excess cholesterol as well as
excess animal protein that causes much of the overload on the
kidneys and their eventual failure. Few people realize that
diabetes is the third most frequent cause of death in the
United States (after cardiovascular disease and cancer) but
it is rather easy to overcome with the Gerson Therapy. Since
the Therapy deals easily and quickly with the cholesterol
overload, the patient's body becomes able to break down and
eliminate the arteriosclerosis, the kidney and eye problems,
as well as the overload on the heart. We have even seen
painful toes, already cold and white due to lack of
circulation from arteriosclerosis, turn warm and pink again
in a week or two on the Gerson Therapy. </P>
<P>Admittedly, it is much easier to deal with age-onset
diabetes, since it is mostly a cholesterol problem with the
resulting arteriosclerosis and kidney damage. When it comes
to juvenile diabetes, we must remember that we are dealing
with true pancreatic dysfunction with resultant poor insulin
production. We have seen some children with juvenile diabetes
improve eyesight, overcome high blood pressure and kidney
damage. But, since the Islets of Langerhans cannot be
restored to full function, these people have to stay close to
the Gerson Therapy for the rest of their lives. In children
and youngsters that is a tall order. On the other hand, we
have seen one patient, who started on the Gerson Therapy with
&quot;40% irreversible damage to his eyesight&quot; according
to his ophthalmologist, with high blood pressure that was
uncontrollable at over 220; with constant kidney pain and
severe edema - be cleared of all these problems using the
Gerson Therapy . But, after some time, at age 22, he was
tired of adhering to this strict diet and felt he could do
well enough without it. He went back to his former ways, the
standard American diet (SAD), and after a few years, went
blind, went on kidney dialysis and eventually died. </P>
<P>This terrible scenario is not only curable but
preventable. However, prevention is one of the most difficult
approaches to &quot;sell&quot; to the public. People usually
feel that, as long as they are well, nothing can happen to
them, and diseases are for other people. Also, they have a
strong resistance to changing their diet and lifestyle.
Prevention of juvenile diabetes starts with the mother. Even
prior to conception, her diet matters. The typical high fat,
high salt, and high protein American diet is unfortunately
not conducive to good health. The mother's diet should
consist largely of fresh (organic, whenever possible) fruit
and vegetables, raw salads and juices and a little non-fat
unsalted protein food, such as non-fat yogurt or cottage
cheese. Also stimulants and drugs should be omitted: coffee,
alcohol and especially cigarettes, not to speak of street or
physician-administered drugs, tranquilizers, sleeping pills
and pain killers. Please note: on a vegetarian, salt-free,
low animal protein diet, people will naturally be free of
pain, sleep well, have no colds and flu and require no drugs.
</P>
<P>The next area of prevention for the mother is, of course,
during her pregnancy. She again needs large amounts of fresh
fruit and vegetables, raw salads, etc. and fresh vegetable
juices. The usual admonition: &quot;take a lot of proteins,
drink plenty of milk&quot; is completely wrong and could even
be dangerous, as it tends to overload the kidneys and produce
toxemia. A properly nourished mother will have a baby strong
in immune response, free of infections and, if the baby is
breast fed, also free of colic. An easy, relatively painless
birth is an extra bonus. </P>
<P>One of the important preventive reasons why breast
feeding is so essential is the very first fluid which enters
the breast. This is not actual milk, but a transparent fluid,
called colostrum. It is nature's gift to this wonderful new
life and helps to build the baby's immune system, the
friendly bacteria in the intestinal tract, etc. It is
unfortunate that some pediatricians feel that they know
better than nature and tell mothers to discard this first
fluid &quot;since it is not milk&quot; and wait until the
&quot;real milk&quot; comes in before breast feeding is to
begin. </P>
<P>The next important preventive step, of course, is the
actual nutrition of the baby. If the baby is fed good, fresh
live foods, first mother's milk, then fresh vegetables,
mashed bananas, apples and fresh oatmeal rather than boxed
'Pablum' or other artificial cereals, the baby will remain
well with good defenses. One of the first additions to the
child's diet, as early as the second or third month, and even
before oatmeal, should be freshly pressed carrot juice, made
from organic carrots. As the child grows, one must keep items
such as ice cream, cookies, cakes, etc., to the barest
minimum, only for special occasions. In an earlier Healing
Newsletter (Vol. 9, No. 3), we published the devastating
effects on children of hot dogs and other spiced sausage
meats. It is also most important to avoid bottled soft
drinks, especially those containing stimulants, such as the
cola drinks. Again, fresh fruit and vegetable juices (carrot
and apple, for instance) are best. </P>
<H2>Adult Diabetes Prevention</H2>
<P>We now go on to the adult prevention program. Obviously,
since age-onset diabetes is caused largely by excess
cholesterol, we have to come to the same conclusions: a low
animal protein and low fat diet, no deep fried foods, minimum
salt and sweet bottled drinks as well as avoidance of
alcohol, cigarettes, and other stimulants. To keep the body's
defenses at a peak level, with high enzyme function, we must
again have the best, fresh, organic fruit and vegetables,
avoid salt, stimulants and drugs, but use fresh vegetable
juices with only occasional 'treats'. </P>
<P><A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> wrote about prevention in his book <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases </A>. He felt that a
diet consisting of 75% building and highly nutritious
material, and 25% of &quot;your choice&quot; would be
adequate. That was 40 years ago. In the intervening years,
technology has damaged the air, water, soil and foods much
more, with the predictable result that most people's
resistance is much lower. Therefore, I would propose a diet
of 90% building and defensive foods (fresh, organic fruit and
vegetables) with at most 10% &quot;at liberty&quot; for
prevention of disease. </P>

<h2>Healing Modern Diseases with the Gerson Therapy</h2>



<p><b>Chronic Fatigue, Candidiasis, Herpes, Lyme Disease, Salmonella, Legionnaire's Disease, AIDS</b>



<p>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson Institute

<p><IMG SRC="banner2.gif" alt="*">

<p>These days, we hear the names of many diseases that were totally

unfamiliar or actually unknown some ten or twenty years ago.  I refer to

them as "modern diseases".  Some, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),

are also known as "Yuppy Diseases", after Young Upwardly-mobile

Professionals, those most commonly affected.  The victims of these

diseases are most often middle-class whites, two thirds of them women.  



<h3>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</h3>



<p>The volume Health Conditions, p. 616, describes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

as "a mysterious infectious illness" that supposedly existed and was

described in the past as "the vapors", and, after World War I, as

"soldier's heart".  Researchers have failed to find a single cause, but

suspect it to be related to the Epstein-Barr virus infection, with

candidiasis and herpes thrown in.  It is almost certainly caused by

infectious agents, whether one or more is relatively immaterial when we

treat it with the Gerson Therapy.  According to Dr. Murray R.  Susser of

Santa Monica, California, symptoms can include deep fatigue, joint pain or

weakness, headache, memory loss, mental confusion, digestive problems,

allergies and depression.  These can also include anxiety, night sweats

and even irregular heartbeat.  



<p>A young man (age 28) seen at the <a href="center.html">hospital</a> had all of these problems

so severely that he had been bedfast for many months, unable to engage in

any activity.  The doctors accused him of laziness and/or psychiatric

problems and put him into the psychiatric ward.  Drugs administered there

worsened his depression so badly he became suicidal.  At the <a href="center.html">hospital</a>,
 with the intensive Gerson Therapy and detoxification, he was up

in a little more than a week, in great good spirits and dancing with his

mother!  In The Gerson Healing Newsletter, Vol. 9 No. 4, (Nov./Dec.

1994), we described another chronic fatigue patient who recovered

completely on the Gerson Therapy.  He had suffered from almost all of the

above described symptoms.  



<p>Health Conditions further quotes Dr. Susser, saying that he firmly

believes that CFS results from "several ongoing, simultaneous infections

that weaken the immune system."  I believe that it is probably the other

way around: it is a weakened immune system (due to previous infections,

antibiotic and other drug treatments, toxicity from foods and the

environment) that allows various organisms to take up residence in the

body.  Once these have damaged the body, it is much easier for other

opportunistic viruses or germs to add to the problem.



<p>Dr. Susser adds that in CFS "we often get hidden, concomitant parasite,

yeast and viral infections that are the result of a weakened immune

system."  



<p>Here is our cue that CFS is not a simple problem but a combination of

immune deficiency diseases, including candida and possible parasites.



<h3>Candidiasis</h3>



<p>Candidiasis, a fungal invasion, has become extremely common. Candida is

commonly found in many body areas, particularly in the gut and vagina.

Candidiasis regularly develops in people who have undergone severe or

long-term treatments with antibiotics.  The mechanism is quite simple:

since candida commonly inhabits the colon, it shares the available

nutrients with friendly bacteria as well as other organisms.  When

patients are treated with antibiotics, these bacteria are killed off - but

the yeast (Candida) survives and is now no longer deprived of nutrients by

other organisms, it has the area and the nutrients to itself.  It is

important to note that patients who receive antibiotic treatments are

already suffering from some infection and are therefore immune

compromised.  The weakened immune system is then subject to a massive

invasion by candida that was unaffected by antibiotics and against which

the body has no defenses.  



<p>Candida really becomes a problem when it invades other tissues,

particularly the nervous system.  The drugs available for treatment, like

all drugs, are often temporarily effective to control the candida - but

they do not heal.  On the contrary, all drugs are toxic and further damage

and weaken the immune system.  The result is that the candida recurs if

and when the drugs have to be discontinued due to toxic liver damage.  



<p>Since cancer chemotherapy also severely damages the immune system,

virtually all cancer patients who were treated with chemo also suffer from

candidiasis.  Furthermore, even those who have not been treated with

cytotoxic (chemo) drugs suffer from a damaged immune system: they could

not have cancer if their immune system were fully functioning.  We can

therefore assume that they, too, have some degree of candida infection.



<h3>Herpes</h3>



<p>Herpes, or fever sores, have been around for a long time.  Genital herpes,

on the other hand, is a relatively new sexually transmitted disease (STD).

Before the advent of AIDS, it was one of the more serious genitally

transmitted diseases and caused much distress in young people. It, too,

defies treatment Herpes simplex is described as an acute viral infection;

while genital herpes is known to be caused by Herpes Virus 2.  This, too,

is clearly an immune deficiency disease and has been overcome by the

Gerson Therapy.



<p>Another form of Herpes, Herpes Zoster or shingles, is also on the rise.

Not only does it cause extreme pain which is difficult to control, but it

generally does not go away.  The severity of the attack will subside, but

constant and recurring problems, including pain, may persist.  There is no

really effective treatment to overcome and cure this herpes infection

except with the intensive Gerson Therapy.



<h3>Lyme Disease</h3>



<p>Lyme Disease was first observed and described in Lyme, Connecticut.  It

seems to be caused by an infectious agent, transmitted by a tick, and

causes various problems, including in some cases arthritis, erythema

(reddening of skin), Bell's palsy, brain and possible heart abnormalities.

It has been improved by the administration of penicillin, however many

cases persist and develop into serious paralyses, nerve and brain

disorders.  We have seen only one patient who suffered from this problem.

She was in a wheelchair, unable to move or control her limbs, was severely

depressed and her condition was deteriorating.  In only a few days on the

Gerson Therapy her overall problems improved considerably.  I have no

follow-up in this case and am unable to report further progress.



<h3>Salmonella</h3>



<p>This is a topic that has to be treated separately, and is not really a

"modern" disease.  It has several forms ranging from mild to severe

gastro-intestinal inflammation all the way to serious food poisoning.

Other species of salmonella are the causative agents of paratyphoid and

typhoid fever. 



<p>The reason salmonella must be included under "modern" infections is that

in its food poisoning action, it is now killing an increasingly large

number of people in the U.S. annually.  The number of salmonella cases

reported in Los Angeles last year, for instance, increased ten times (from

just over 100, to just over 1,000) over the previous year.



<p>The culprit, to a large extent, is the chicken industry.  We talked about

"The Case Against Chicken" in the Gerson Healing Newsletter, Vol. 9, No.

1, (May/June 1994), but this discussion did not include any of the many

infectious agents found in chicken due to current automated, high-volume,

profit-oriented processing.  Surely many of our readers saw the article in

Time Magazine (Oct. 17, 1994) titled "Something Smells Fowl", and

describing the horrendous and unsanitary conditions found in today's

chicken processing plants.  Aside from salmonella, chicken are generally

infected with Camphylobacter, E.  coli or other micro-organisms, according

to the Time article. "Each year at least 6.5 million and possibly as many

as 80 million people get sick from chicken, and some 1,000 people die,

according to conservative estimates".  Although cooking the meat properly

will generally kill the infectious bacteria, any kitchen surface or

implement that the infected meat touches can also become contaminated and

potentially dangerous.



<p>In discussing the damage done by consuming chicken, neither our own

May/June issue, nor the Time Magazine article touched on the treatment of

the animals while they are alive.  The incubated eggs are injected before

they hatch, since they would otherwise not even produce live chicks.

Chickens are heavily treated with hormones and antibiotics to keep them

alive - and they must generally be slaughtered at a very early age (for

chickens) - or they die of disease.  Yet, with intensive advertising, the

immense (7 billion chickens are slaughtered in the United States annually)

and profitable chicken industry has convinced much of the American public

that eating this septic, decaying, sick and chemical-laced meat is

healthier and preferable to eating red meat because of its lower fat and

cholesterol content.  I am by no means advocating the consumption of red

meat, pork or veal - none of which are the slightest bit healthful.  I am

instead pointing out that eating chicken is not a reasonable choice for a

person wishing to maintain good health.



<p>The above material is presented to give the reader background information

on the increasing dangers of "modern" sources of infection.  But, in my

opinion, all these modern diseases are really only symptoms of the

seriously decreased resistance and damaged immune systems of our current

population.  In all these cases, infections are involved, and in many of

them (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Candidiasis, Genital Herpes, Lyme

Disease), there is no cure by drugs or other orthodox methods.  Yet the

Gerson Therapy has been shown to help people overcome these diseases.

This shows that the Gerson Therapy strengthens and restores the immune

system and thus helps the body to overcome these "incurable" ailments.



<h3>Legionnaires' Disease</h3>



<p>Among "modern diseases," Legionnaire's Disease should also be mentioned,

especially in connection with impaired immune systems.  This "mysterious

new disease" was first described in a number of cases which afflicted

members of the American Legion who were attending a convention in

Philadelphia in 1976.  The disease is a serious type of pneumonia, yet is

often carried without producing disease.  According to the text Current

Medical Diagnosis, Legionnaires' Disease is caused by an opportunistic

germ (meaning that it attacks weakened or defenseless persons) and

generally affects the elderly, smokers and people on dialysis or who have

been given organ transplants.  The latter, of course, must be treated with

immune suppressant agents or their bodies would reject the transplants.

In other words, their immune systems are severely and intentionally

depressed, and they become susceptible to opportunistic infections.



<h3>AIDS</h3>



<p>No discussion of "modern diseases" would be complete without mentioning

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.  This, as the name

indicates, is the ultimate failure of the immune system.  It stands to

reason, then, that since the Gerson Therapy restores the immune system, it

could well overcome this problem, too.  At present, it is difficult for me

to claim that the Gerson Therapy will cure AIDS.  Due to restrictions

imposed by the Mexican health authorities, we are not allowed to accept

AIDS patients.  As a result, we have not been able to follow AIDS patients

to observe results.  We have seen good recoveries in two cases of patients

who were treated for HIV infections on an out-patient basis.  I feel

uncomfortable making any curative claims for the Gerson Therapy on the

basis of such a small sample.  Yet, one cannot help but assume that, with

the improved immune response produced by the Gerson Therapy as with so

many other diseases, AIDS should respond very well.



<p>Dr. Gerson was aware very early in his career that his Therapy was able to

improve and restore the immune system - since he was able to cure

tuberculosis of all types well before the advent of antibiotics.  I even

remember a case of infantile paralysis in New York that was reversed

almost immediately with the Gerson Therapy.  Obviously the immune system

plays an extremely important role in the treatment of cancer.  The

restored immune response is largely credited with helping the body break

down and dissolve tumor tissue.  Conversely, since all the above diseases

are on the rise, we also have to understand that, due to modern

agricultural methods, food processing methods, damage to our bodies with

toxins, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, with medical drug treatments, etc., our

immune systems are more and more seriously damaged or paralyzed.  In order

to heal anything we have to work to restore the whole body, and with it,

the immune system.  And since the Gerson Therapy does just that, it has

been able to heal both 'ancient' and 'modern' diseases.

and the Gerson Patient</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<H2>Chemotherapy and the Gerson Patient</H2>
<H4>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson
Institute</H4>
<P>During the mid-fifties, just as <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> was demonstrating some of his most dramatic
results with a nutritional treatment for cancer, chemotherapy
started to be used by establishment medicine. The reason was
the general disillusion with the results of surgery and
radiation in the treatment of cancer patients. The
chemotherapeutic drugs were supposed to stop the fast
reproduction of tumor cells - and thus stop cancer.
Originally, these highly toxic agents were based on the
mustard gas of warfare of which there was a huge remaining
supply after the end of World War II. When these drugs soon
were found to be too toxic and at best only temporarily
effective, new combinations were compounded all supposedly
stopping or slowing the multiplication of fast growing
tissue. But since there are various tissues in the human body
which must multiply rapidly (bone marrow producing red and
white blood corpuscles which constitute a large part of the
immune system) other very serious side-effects were always
present with the chemotherapy treatments: damage to bone
marrow; poisoning of the liver and often destruction of the
kidneys, not to speak of damage also to the heart. </P>
<P>In spite of over 30 years of use of chemotherapy in the
treatment of cancer patients, and in spite of its status as a
'proven' cancer treatment, these drugs have never been
officially accepted nor do they have the full approval of
FDA. Chemotherapy is still an &quot;experimental&quot;
treatment, largely because it has never undergone 'double
blind' studies. Why not? </P>
<P>Chemotherapy was just being introduced toward the end of
<A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A>'s practice in New York, shortly before he
died. He talks about his experience with Johnny Gunther in
Appendix II of A Cancer Therapy Results of 50 Cases, p. 415.
(See also John Gunther's book, Death Be Not Proud) Johnny was
possibly the only patient <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> treated after he had been given chemotherapy.
The book describes the terrible response, the swollen arm,
the severe bone marrow depression and the doctor's
expectation that Johnny would quickly die. Nobody suspected
that <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> could reverse some of the damage. But <A
href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> could not have known what the Gerson doctors
in Mexico have discovered after years of working with cancer
patients who had previously been given chemotherapy, namely
that these heavy drugs are released back into the system and
cause the prior poisoning symptoms to show up once more. This
generally happens after some six months on the Gerson
Therapy. That was also Dr. Gerson's experience with Johnny
Gunther - but he did not know that it was due to the prior
chemotherapy treatment. He took the blame for Johnny's death,
assuming that the only cause was the treatment with hormones
which he had applied. </P>
<P>Oncologists using chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of
their cancer patients are told that the body, in time,
excretes these drugs, and that the damage is thus overcome.
It is true that many patients grow hair again after they have
lost it; that their blood count comes back up to near normal
and their mucous membranes heal after breaking down with
ulcers due to the chemotherapy treatments. They overcome the
terrible nausea and vomiting caused by the toxic drugs, the
weakness and depression, etc. (Of course if they suffer also
the loss of kidney function due to the chemotherapeutic
drugs, this does not reverse. The kidneys, once destroyed, do
not recover.) But overcoming the immediate toxicity does not
prove that all the toxic materials have left the body. On the
contrary, the Gerson doctors' experience with patients who
have had prior treatment with chemotherapy gives an entirely
different picture. </P>
<P>When the first Gerson Therapy treatment facility in
Mexico (La Gloria) was started in 1977, we went as closely as
possible by <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A>'s directions in his book, <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy </A> . But since <A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> didn't have any experience with chemotherapy
patients, his book contains no special directions regarding
such patients. No special adjustments were made by the Gerson
doctors for such patients. Our first serious shock came when,
at almost the same time, two patients with previous
chemotherapy treatments were admitted and started on the
Therapy. They received the full intensive treatment,
including the starting medications, five coffee enemas a day,
and the castor oil treatment every other day. As the bodies
of these two patients detoxified intensively, they had all
the symptoms of a chemotherapy overdose. Of course the Gerson
physicians had given none of these drugs. So the only
conclusion was that the drugs still remaining in the body
from treatments many months earlier, were being released
rapidly, in large amounts, poisoning these patients a second
time! They landed in intensive care, they were so ill. The
Gerson doctors were shocked into the realization that
chemotherapy patients could not be treated with the same
protocols as those who had received none of these toxic
drugs. It must also be understood that patients treated with
chemotherapeutic agents often had recurrences which caused
them to seek alternative therapies. </P>
<P>At one point, the results of the Gerson Therapy in
patients with previous chemotherapy treatments were so poor
that we refused to accept such patients. However, in time,
some patients begged to be allowed to come. Others, after
chemotherapy, felt that the Gerson Therapy was so logical and
basic that they tried the Gerson Therapy at home on their own
and, to our great surprise, succeeded! So, it became clear
that it could be done. </P>
<P>With this empirical evidence in hand, the Gerson Therapy
physicians began to treat patients who had received prior
chemotherapy. These patients were given less intensive
medications; they were given only two or three coffee enemas
daily instead of the regular five. They were not given castor
oil treatments, in order to avoid sudden and intensive
detoxification and they improved. It was now a question
whether this less intensive treatment would work fast enough
and well enough to stop the advance of the cancer, yet not so
fast as to cause an overdose of the chemotherapeutic
chemicals being pushed out of their systems. In many cases,
it worked. Admittedly, the results in cases where patients
had received prior chemotherapy were sharply reduced compared
to those who received no such toxic drugs. But, in many
cases, we were still able to obtain recoveries. </P>
<P>We did find out, however, that certain cancers do not
respond after chemotherapy. Pancreatic cancer, which shows
excellent results on the Gerson Therapy, does not respond
after the patient had received chemotherapy. The same goes
for cancers that have extensively metastasized (spread) into
the liver. Leukemias, after heavy chemotherapy, are also
difficult to reverse with the Gerson Therapy. Brain tumors
fall into the same category. Melanomas, which usually respond
exceptionally well to the Gerson Therapy, do relatively
poorly after chemotherapy. All types of lymphomas do
relatively well on the Gerson Therapy despite chemotherapy;
the same goes for ovarian cancers. Of course, all types of
cancer respond much better with no prior toxic drug
treatments. </P>
<P>According to various sources, after the administration of
chemotherapy, the patient's body excretes somewhere between
35% and 50% of the drugs given. The problem for a researcher
is to prove this statement. Unfortunately, there are no true
tests for toxicity in the system. I personally feel that the
remaining toxic drugs could be lodged in the connective or
fatty tissues. They cannot possibly remain in the liver; this
essential organ would be poisoned beyond function. But all
drug tests are performed on serum or blood samples, not solid
tissues. Fluids do not show positive for these agents simply
because the drugs are not circulating, but are lodged in some
tissue. </P>
<P>The reason we feel so certain that poisons remain in the
body after chemotherapy treatments, even up to two years
later, is that we see the patients excreting them. In the
course of the Gerson Therapy, patients typically go through
healing crises, or &quot;Flare-Ups,&quot; described by <A
href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> in <A href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy </A> , pp. 201-203. During these flare-ups
we see that the patient's body excretes many accumulated
toxins. Often, these toxins are readily identifiable by their
odors. When patients who had prior chemo go through these
detoxifying 'flare-up' days, they experience the same
symptoms they originally felt while they were receiving the
chemotherapeutic agents: they feel nauseous, taste the
chemicals, smell the drugs in their stool, have some loss of
hair, mouth ulcers, and temporarily depressed red and white
blood cell counts. Since we have learned to treat and
detoxify these patients cautiously, we find that the heavy
chemotherapy drug releases can happen at about six months
into the Gerson Therapy. At that time the patient either
recovers or goes into decline. </P>
<P>Since our experience with patients who have had prior
chemotherapy is always questionable, we have often refused to
admit patients who had received a &quot;bone marrow
transplant.&quot; These patients are treated extremely
heavily with chemotherapeutic chemicals, after their bone
marrow is removed. The marrow is then returned, on the theory
that since it has remained free of the toxic drugs, it will
continue to function. In fact, that does not happen, since
the drugs continue to circulate in the body and, of course,
soon contaminate the 'clean' bone marrow. </P>
<P>One patient, suffering from ovarian cancer, and showing
poor results after several courses of chemotherapy, was given
a bone marrow transplant at a cost upward of $150,000.00.
This treatment did not control her cancer, which continued to
spread. She then called us and wished to be admitted to the
<A href="center.html">
hospital </A> for the Gerson Therapy. However, while she
admitted to being heavily treated with chemotherapy, she did
not tell the Gerson physicians about receiving a bone marrow
transplant. So, with a warning that chemotherapy patients do
not respond as well as those who have not been pretreated,
she was accepted for the Gerson Therapy. She was given the
less intensive therapy, developed specifically for patients
who have had prior chemotherapy, and responded quite well.
Her symptoms and blood counts improved. However, as expected,
after six months from the start of the Gerson Therapy, she
went into a heavy 'healing reaction'. In her case, this
consisted of abscesses breaking out all over her body. These
boils released pus, and, of course, she was very
uncomfortable during a few weeks. Nevertheless, she worked
through it - and after it was over, was much better. We have
to assume that, in her case, much of the heavy poisoning was
excreted through the skin. </P>
<P>There are more and more reports by establishment
oncologists doubting the value of chemotherapy, even to the
point of rejecting it outright. One of these, cancer
biostatistician Dr. Ulrich Abel, of Heidelberg, Germany,
issued a monograph titled Chemotherapy of Advanced Epithelial
Cancer in 1990. (See Healing Journal, No. 1-2, Vol.7 of the
Gerson Institute.) Epithelial cancers comprise the most
common forms of adenocarcinoma: lung, breast, prostate,
colon, etc. After ten years as a statistician in clinical
oncology, Abel became increasingly uneasy. &quot;A sober and
unprejudiced analysis of the literature,&quot; he wrote,
&quot;has rarely revealed any therapeutic success by the
regimens in question in treating advanced epithelial
cancer.&quot; While chemotherapy is being used more and more
extensively, more than a million people die worldwide of
these cancers annually - and a majority have received some
form of chemotherapy before dying. Abel further concluded,
after polling hundreds of cancer doctors, &quot;The personal
view of many oncologists seems to be in striking contrast to
communications intended for the public.&quot; Abel cited
studies that have shown &quot;that many oncologists would not
take chemotherapy themselves if they had cancer.&quot; (The
Cancer Chronicles, December, 1990.) &quot;Even though toxic
drugs often do effect a response, a partial or complete
shrinkage of the tumor, this reduction does not prolong
expected survival,&quot; Abel finds. &quot;Sometimes, in
fact, the cancer returns more aggressively than before, since
the chemo fosters the growth of resistant cell lines.&quot;
Besides, the chemo has severely damaged the body's own
defenses, the immune system and often the kidneys as well as
the liver. </P>
<P>In an especially dramatic table, Dr. Abel displays the
results of chemotherapy in patients with various types of
cancers, as the improvement of survival rates, compared to
untreated patients. </P>
<P>This table shows:</P>
<UL><LI>In colorectal cancer: no evidence survival is
improved. </LI>
<LI>Gastric cancer: no clear evidence. </LI>
<LI>Pancreatic cancer: Study completely negative. Longer
survival in control (untreated) group. </LI>
<LI>Bladder: no clinical trial done. </LI>
<LI>Breast cancer: No direct evidence that chemotherapy
prolongs survival; its use is &quot;ethically
questionable.&quot; (That is particularly newsworthy, since
all breast cancer patients, before or after surgery, are
given chemotherapy drugs.) </LI>
<LI>Ovarian cancer: no direct evidence. </LI>
<LI>Cervix and uterus: No improved survival. </LI>
<LI>Head and neck: no survival benefit but occasional
shrinkage of tumors. </LI>
</UL>
<P>More recently, the Nov. 17, 1994 Wall Street Journal, in
a front page article on political pressure being exerted for
insurance companies to pay for bone marrow transplants in
advanced breast cancer, experts give a totally negative
report on this approach. The procedure, called ABMT
(Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant) involves temporarily
removing some of the patient's bone marrow, applying a
potentially lethal dose of chemotherapy, then returning the
marrow to the patient's body. The cost of this procedure is
in excess of $100,000.00 . </P>
<P>The University of Colorado's Dr. Jones, continues the
Journal, claims that, with conventional chemotherapy, not
more than 2% of patients with spreading breast cancer get a
positive response. A non-profit independent technology
assessment agency, the Emergency Care Research Institute
(ECRI), says that for the average woman with the most
advanced form of breast cancer, the high dose ABMT procedure
is not only worthless, but also likely to shorten her life.
This report by the ECRI is based on an analysis of 40 studies
of ABMT and similar procedures involving a total of 1,017
patients, and 61 studies covering 4,852 patients who had
conventional chemotherapy. Dr. Nelson Erlick, the project's
lead analyst, concluded that &quot;many patients are led to
believe that this (ABMT) is a successful therapy. We found no
evidence whatsoever that it provides any benefit.&quot; </P>
<P>Since the Gerson Therapy is often described by orthodox
oncologists as 'quackery', we'd like our readers to consider
this: If quackery describes an expensive treatment that the
technician knows ahead of time to be ineffective (or even
harmful), what is ABMT (bone marrow transplant)? Yet health
plan providers are being ordered to pay for it by the Office
of Personnel Management, a federal agency. </P>

<img src="cgerson1.gif" alt="Graphic Image" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 VSPACE=4><FONT SIZE=+2>Clinical Depression ...  a Biochemical Problem</FONT>

<BR>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson Institute



<P>Clinical Depression is a subject that could well have been included

in our last Healing Newsletter as a 'modern disease'.  Of course

depression is not new; it has been plaguing people for centuries.

However, recently it has been accepted as a disease syndrome and as

being 'treatable'.  This means that it can be drug treated.  It is

depressing just to read the symptoms given: (Current Medical

Diagnosis & Treatment, Krupp & Chatton)



o Lowered mood, sadness to intense feelings of guilt and hopelessness



o Difficulty in thinking, inability to concentrate, inability to make decisions

o Loss of interest, less involvement with work and recreation



o Headache, disrupted sleep, change in appetite, decreased sexual drive



o Anxiety



o Suicidal tendencies



<P>As the disease progresses, the symptoms become more severe.  In all

orthodox approaches to disease, the symptoms are treated, not the

underlying problems.  The present drugs of choice are the mood

altering medications, one example of which is imipramine.  



<P>Years ago, we saw a patient who had been treated with imipramine for

some 15 years.  Her depression and anxiety were still present, but

had been more or less controlled by the drug.  The side effects,

however, were almost unbearable: she was virtually blind, could just

identify her own hand held in front of her eyes; and she was still

depressed.  But the patient's worst symptom was the constant feeling

of worms crawling under her skin and out of all her body openings.

Her symptoms intensified if she didn't take the drug.  In only a few

days on the Gerson Therapy, her vision had improved to near normal

and her mood was a great deal better.  The 'crawling' sensations,

however, took longer to relieve.  More recently, we had a patient who

was being treated for lymphoma.  She had been on the Gerson Therapy

for some time, but came back to the <a href="center.html">hospital</a> for hyperbaric

oxygen treatments.  She mentioned, one day, that she was experiencing

a crawling sensation under her skin.  I asked her if she had ever

been treated for depression with antidepressant drugs.  She thought a

moment and then replied, yes, some 35 years ago, after the birth of

her daughter.  These drugs were still lodged in her system and only

just being excreted in the course of a healing reaction on the Gerson

Therapy.  When they reentered the bloodstream, she re-experienced the

same symptoms she felt when the drug was first administered.  Since

drugs do not overcome the underlying problems, they are often

administered for years, yet never clear the disease.



<P>Brain dysfunctions are generally referred to as mental diseases.  To

many, this classification implies genetic problems, and carries the

stigma of being crazy or demented.  Often, in fact, these diseases

are metabolic disorders, and therefore curable by healing the

metabolism.



<P>The brain is an incredibly delicate and finely balanced instrument..

It also requires substantially more oxygen than other tissues.  While

it only constitutes only about 6-8% of total body mass, it is

believed to require as much as 20% of the system's total oxygen

intake.  



<P>As in all chronic diseases, the underlying problems in brain

malfunction are toxicity and deficiency.  The Standard American Diet

(SAD) is generally at fault.  



<P>Ross Horne, in his book, The Health Revolution, has reproduced two

interesting photomicrographs from Dr.  Ronald Glasser's The Body is

the Hero.  In it, we see the effect of a high-fat meal on red blood

corpuscles (cells).  In order to properly fulfill their oxygen

transport function, red blood corpuscles should float freely and

independently in the bloodstream, exposing the maximum surface area

to adsorb, carry and release oxygen.  However, after a high-fat meal,

the cells that should float freely (see Figure 2) become stuck

together and clumped into rolls, much like the rolls of coins one

gets at the bank, see Figure 1.  These rolls are called rouleaux.

The photomicrograph shows that a large proportion of red blood

corpuscles are still forming rouleaux six hours after a high fat

meal.  When they are glued together, blood cells have a much reduced

total surface area, thus can carry much less oxygen.  Furthermore,

these rouleaux are too large and inflexible to travel through the

tiny capillaries (hair vessels) and deliver their life-supporting

oxygen to the most remote cells in the circulatory system.  With the

brain's high oxygen requirement, it cannot function properly under

conditions of oxygen starvation.  This explains why people experience

sleepiness and lack of energy after a heavy meal.  They often try to

overcome the 'depression' by the use of stimulants: coffee, alcohol

or cigarettes.  It takes some six to ten hours for the body to clear

the fat from the bloodstream and "unclump" the red blood cells.

Within six hours, however, most people will have consumed another

fatty meal: breakfast with eggs and bacon or sausage; lunch with a

hamburger or hot-dog; dinner with meat, chicken, cheese, milk,

butter, or other high-fat substances.  The result is that we live in

a constant state of oxygen starvation when we eat diets high in fat

content.  Yet this describes the SAD diet precisely.  40% or more of

the calories the average American consumes come from the fat content

of our food.  Our brains and other vital organs are being slowly

strangled, deprived of their life-giving oxygen.



<P>In addition to fat and cholesterol, the SAD diet contains many

chemical additives: dyes, preservatives, emulsifiers, flavor

enhancers, plus residual pesticides, hormones, and antibiotics from

animal products.  Some 10,000 chemicals are accepted as food

additives, certified safe by our Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

In our opinion, no chemical food additives are safe for daily

ingestion! It has been amply demonstrated that hyperactive children

become perfectly normal when they are placed on a diet free of food

additives.  Instead of using this approach, however, orthodox doctors

use drugs such as phenobarbital to calm these children.  But

psychoactive drugs, used over a period of time, can themselves cause

brain damage! All toxic substances, including food additives, are

enzyme inhibitors, further depressing the normal functions of brain

cells.  Is it surprising that people become depressed, hyperactive,

aggressive, and suicidal? (Suicide is one of the leading causes of

death among teenagers.) I must admit that I am always impressed with

the fact that so many people function as well as they do, as long as

they do, given what they eat.  



<P>But are we really functioning fully? Nathan Pritikin describes how

"children whose diets are changed from the typical Western high-fat

diet to a diet low in fat, can perform simple mental tasks 20% faster

and with greater accuracy once their blood is clear of fat."

Pritikin asks, "Does our entire population struggle along at about

75% of their mental capacity? Is this why our television programs

are so infantile?" But what if we go further than eliminating fats

from the children's diet? What if we also eliminate food additives

and other toxins and sugar? What if we give our children the best

high-micronutrient diet, such as a less intensive Gerson Therapy,

could we increase their mental capacity by much more than 20%? And

would this not also hold true for the rest of us?



<P>In conclusion, clinical depression is not just treatable (by drugs),

it is curable.  The answer to chronic disease is always the same:

once you understand the underlying problems, deficiency and toxicity,

and solve those, the body is capable of healing.  Detoxifying and

flooding the body with a high nutrient diet, the Gerson Therapy, is

the total approach to healing.

<title>Alternative Therapies</title>
<body>
<center><h1>Alternative Therapies</h1>
<h2>Slowly gaining mainstream acceptance </h2>

<h6>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson Institute</h6></center>

On January 1, 1996, the Los Angeles Times carried a front page article titled New Life for Old Remedies.  We felt this to be a very important development.  Our members and other friends will surely find it encouraging that "old remedies" (the true healing
 of herbs, nutrition, acupuncture, homeopathy, etc.), according to this article, are once again finding acceptance.  Since orthodox doctors, too, are spokesmen, we would like to report in some detail on this front-page news article.<p>
The article"s subtitle reads: "No longer dismissed as fringe ideas, such "traditional" therapies as acupuncture and herbs are going mainstream.  Once-wary doctors are using them to complement conventional medicine." The article was written by Marlene Cimons, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer.  <P>
The article opens with a report on a patient suffering cruelly from one of the most violent pains known: trigeminal neuralgia.  The pain is caused by a nerve inflammation in the cheek.  Narcotics and nerve blocks gave this patient only little relief, and 
had severe side effects: the patient was unable to sleep, couldn't concentrate and suffered from depression.   The physician who was finally consulted, Dr. Brian Berman in Baltimore used homeopathic remedies, derived from herbs.  Within six months, the pain receded by two-thirds.  The patient continues to use these remedies, and is able to keep the pain under control.<P>
The author continues: "Now many other doctors are beginning to do the same thing.  They have discovered that integrating the unconventional with the mainstream not only can provide relief but also can do so with fewer side effects and without more invasive procedures, such as surgery." More and more scientific evidence is strengthening approaches once considered radical or alternative, that are now being considered "complementary".   The article claims that many physicians, "even those most resistant to alternative medicine," are now taking a second look.  The article quotes Dr. Nancy Dickey, a family practice physician, chair of the board of trustees of the American Medical Association, a most conservative even reactionary organization.  Dr. Dickey admitted that "if I had a patient who said, "I quit using codeine since I started doing acupuncture", I'd say, "Terrific"."<p>
Since these so-called "alternative" methods are, in fact, the ancient and original approaches to treatment of illness, they are actually "traditional" medicine.  Outside of the United States, they are referred to as such.  According to the World Health Organization of the United Nations, 65% to 80% of the worlds health care services are what we would call alternative.  Dr. Wayne B.  Jonas, director of the National Institutes of Health Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), is quoted as saying that "These 
become complementary, alternative or unconventional when used in Western countries.  Even in countries where modern Western biomedicine dominates, the public makes extensive use of unconventional practices."<p>
A 1990 study showed that one in three Americans saw an alternative health care practitioner that year.  More than 80% used alternatives in conjunction with conventional medicine, according to the NIH.   However, an item in The Cancer Chronicles, published
 by People Against Cancer, discusses a summer 1993 convention of the AMA, in the course of which delegates proposed a resolution condemning "recognition and endorsement of non-scientific alternative medical care paltriness".  This was done in the name of 
"freedom and patient's rights"! According to the logic of B. J. Kennedy, MD, a delegate from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, "Use of these therapies interferes with patients' access to regular medical care."<p>
According to a report under the heading of "Abstracts" in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, January 1996, Vol.  2, No.  1, "A survey by David Eisenberg and colleagues indicated that in 1990, consumers made an estimated 425 million 
visits to providers of alternative therapies (they also made 388 million visits to primary care physicians) and spent $13.7 billion , mostly out-of-pocket (they spent $12.8 billion out-of-pocket for all hospitalizations during the same period).  It was estimated that one of three Americans used alternative therapies in 1990, and most did not tell their physicians they were using these therapies." <p>
After the results were in from a carefully designed questionnaire, the journal continues, "180 physicians returned completed questionnaires; 70% to 90% considered many alternative therapies to be legitimate and a majority had referred patients to nonphysicians or used these therapies in their own practice.  Of the respondents, 70% expressed interest in training in multiple areas of alternative medicine."<p>
Medical schools are beginning to add training in alternative therapies to their curricula.  "Insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other health plans have begun to cover alternative treatments in part," the author continues, "because they often cost less than standard procedures, and also because customers want them."<p>
A most interesting item follows: it seems that physicians themselves have become "consumers of alternative medicine" says Dr. James Gordon, chairman of the program advisory council of the NIHs OAM.  "I've certainly seen physicians change because they had
 a health problem that was not helped by conventional therapy."  Dr. Gordon had injured his back and obtained no relief from "orthodox" remedies, but was apparently helped by an osteopath. <P> 
"The NIH's Jonas points out that a new drug's average "half-life" or period of peak use is about 20 years.  Homeopathy has been around, unchanged, for almost 200 years, acupuncture for more than 2,000 years, prayer and spiritualism for at least 20,000 years.  And if one believes reports of monkeys using plant products to regulate their menstrual cycles, herbalism, probably the oldest, has been around for greater than 200,000 years." <p>
Homeopathy was originally introduced from Europe by Dr. Hahnemann and is based on the idea of "like cures like".  Homeopathy consists of treating a disease by giving highly diluted preparations of substances that, in larger doses, actually cause the same 
symptoms.   The author of the article quotes several success stories with alternative medicine, including that of the wife of a physician, herself a nurse, who could not stand the side effects of the painkillers she was taking to treat fibromyalgia.  She 
was highly skeptical but, with acupuncture, homeopathy and herbs, she could wean herself off drugs.  [The wife of a patient at the Gerson Treatment Center, who was suffering from fibromyalgia, was cleared of her pain in three days by simply eating the organic vegetarian, unsalted foods served at the hospital.] <p>
Many doctors are still resistant to alternative medicine, partly because they feel that there is not enough scientific evidence demonstrating its effectiveness, and that most of what evidence there is, though striking, is "anecdotal".  Dr. Berman predicts
 that it will take another decade for society to undergo a major transformation in its acceptance of alternative therapies.  He feels it will only happen when there is enough "scientific" evidence to prove these therapies effective.  The author also admits that even though doctors are more and more willing to turn to alternative medicine, the medical establishment in the United States is so strong that it is still able to define what "health care" should be.   Physicians are still being taught that alternatives are mostly folk medicine, supposedly a "less evolved" form of medicine.<P>
The fact remains, however, that the public is becoming demonstrably more disenchanted with the ineffective treatments of allopathic, technological medicine, especially for degenerative diseases, and is "voting with their feet" by their patronage of alternative practitioners, for the ancient methods that still work.<p>

<CENTER><H2>Patient Story: Cure of a Brain Tumor</H2>
<P><BR> </P>
<H3>by Charlotte Gerson</H3>
</CENTER><P>The aim of the Gerson Therapy is always to heal
and restore people to a normal active life. We sometimes get
phone calls and information from some of these cured people
with wonderful stories that we need to share with our
readers. We should also like to stress that we love to hear
from you people out there after you have been well for some
time. Don't for a moment think that we are no longer
interested in your recovery. On the contrary, the longer you
are well, the more important and dramatic the story! Please
keep in touch and let us know.</P>
<P>One such wonderful success story is that of Nora K. of
North Liberty, Indiana. Just weeks from her 10th birthday,
she started to suffer from headaches, then vomiting. Her
mother took her for a CAT scan and a brain tumor was
discovered. She then was taken to the Riley Children's
Hospital in Indianapolis and was scheduled for surgery. The
surgeon removed what he could, but some of the tumor was too
close to a blood vessel and was only cauterized. This, of
course, left the door open to more tumor growth.
Subsequently, Nora went for yearly check-ups. When she was
13, an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) showed a recurrence.
The doctor said that at this point, he couldn't do anything,
&quot;the tumor wasn't big enough to operate&quot;. Nora's
mother, Mary, felt that she couldn't just sit by and wait for
her daughter's tumor to grow. She started to read and
research. She found the Gerson Therapy. </P>
<P>In 1990, Mary and Nora came to the Mexican hospital and
started the Gerson Therapy. Nora was on the Therapy,
strictly, for one and a half years. During this time, with
the frequent coffee enemas and juices, Nora did not go to a
public school, but had home schooling. She also spent a great
deal of time with coffee enemas on the bathroom floor. She
used this time constructively: she read all the classics she
could get her hands on, then she read Plato and other
philosophers, then she went on to read science books and
math. She got a tremendous education. When she took her
SAT's, she scored extremely high; on her State equivalency
test her score was almost perfect. With all her background
and reading, she also became an excellent writer. </P>
<P>At the end of her intensive Therapy, she had another
check-up with her neurosurgeon. He took some pictures,
studied them, was puzzled, hesitated, took some more pictures
- and finally said that he couldn't see any more tumor, just
a shadow which he felt was a scar. Nora's mother asked what
Nora's prognosis was. The surgeon said that she would never
have a problem again! Nora was also playing the violin. The
doctor was very pleased that she could play the violin and
this was a very good sign, since the type of tumor she was
suffering from would affect the fine motor skills. He said
that she would not be able to play the violin with a tumor in
her brain, these delicate motor skills would have been
disturbed.</P>
<P>After one and a half years on the strict Therapy, Nora
switched to a maintenance therapy: she was still taking 2 - 3
quarts of juice daily and eating organic food. Her mother
started an organic co-op business, helping to supply herself
and a number of other people in the area with organic food.
Mary K. says that she is now helping some 40 people to obtain
their organic produce. Nora is 19 years old, and has been
admitted to college. Not only that, but she obtained a
Presidential Scholarship, a very high honor, and hopes to
study medicine - alternative medicine - to help others as she
was helped.</P>

<title>From Charlotte Gerson's Clinical Notebook</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<body>

<CENTER><img src="cgerson1.gif" alt="*"></CENTER>



<h3>From Charlotte Gerson's Clinical Notebook</h3>

<h3>M.D.s Use Gerson Therapy To Cure Themselves: Colon Cancer, Breast Cancer</h3>



<h3>Colon Cancer with Liver Metastases</h3>



<p>On Sep.  8, 1994, Yoshihiko Hochino, Professor of Medicine at Japan's Fukushima 

University Medical School published an article in a Japanese health journal.  About four 

years ago, he found that he had colon cancer, spreading (metastases) to the liver.  Since 

he is a professor of medicine, he was very much aware of the fact that orthodox medicine 

(surgery or chemotherapy) has nothing to offer patients with this problem.  He found Dr.  

Max Gerson's book, A Cancer Therapy, which was translated into Japanese some 5 years 

ago.  Using this book, he treated and cured himself completely.  It is now  some four years 

later, and he remains in good health, 'cured' (by his own claim in the article).



<p>Australian Nelly Goldfeld had essentially the same problem.  It began  with colon cancer 

four years ago, and was treated with surgery for the removal of the tumor.  But, since the 

tumor is just 'the tip of the iceberg', and removing it doesn't clear the underlying problem, 

the cancer almost always recurs.  It recurred in Nelly's case, in her liver.



<p>Like Professor Hochino, she vowed to beat this cancer, even though her doctors gave her little hope 

of survival.  They told Nelly that they could try 'experimental' laser treatment, with little chance of 

effectiveness. Nelly then learned about the Gerson Therapy.  A newspaper report in Doncaster and Templestowe 

News, an Australian newspaper, on October 5, 1994 tells Nelly's story.  She started the Gerson T

herapy on Feb. 14th, 'stocking her house full of fresh fruit and vegetables, vitamin supplements, 

a juicer and water purifier.' We quote from the above newspaper story: "Nelly still remembers the 

bewildered look on her doctor's face when she went to have an ultrasound just ten days after 

taking up the diet.  They were astounded.  The doctor said to me: 'Well it seems you've scared

 them off, Mrs.  Goldfeld.'  Three of the cancerous lesions had completely disappeared, and 

the fourth had substantially decreased in size."



<p>"Seven months later, Nelly has returned to being the rosy-cheeked grandmother she 

once was.  She believes she has fulfilled her vow to rid her body of cancer.



<p>"It's not easy, but I have my life.  For the first two months, I was too weak to do all 

he work myself, so we got someone in to help us.  But after that, I got so much energy 

and was able to do everything myself.



<p>"Nelly's claims are backed up by her medical reports, which show a rapid improvement 

in her health from the time of her ultrasound.  'My case is not exceptional.  There are 

hundreds like me.  I just hope people read about this (Gerson) Therapy before they go and 

have chemical or radiation treatment.' "



<p><b>Dr. Lorraine Day</b>



<p>We had the great pleasure of meeting Dr.  Lorraine Day at the annual convention 

of the Cancer Control Society in September of 1994.  At that time, Dr.  Day told her 

story.  She had developed breast cancer, but recovered after refusing mutilating surgery, 

radiation and chemotherapy.



<p>Most impressive was her statement that she rejected "traditional" therapies because 

she studied the medical literature - which proved to her that these treatments are 

ineffective! Why are patients not given this information, available to professionals? Dr.  

Day says she came to the common sense conclusion that "you cannot destroy the immune 

system and get well at the same time." She discovered  nutritional healing, the Gerson 

Therapy, and says: "CANCER DOESN'T SCARE ME ANYMORE!"



<p>Dr.  Lorraine Day has the courage to defy orthodox medicine by getting up 

before the entire audience of the Cancer Control Society and testifying, as follows:



<p>"I am Dr.  Lorraine Day.  Some of you know me from the book I wrote: AIDS 

What the Government Isn't Telling You.  Several years ago, I actually spoke here 

about AIDS.  I have been coming to the Cancer Control Society meetings regularly for 

three years and I have learned more about medicine and how to take care of yourself 

than I learned in 20 years as an orthodox trauma surgeon.  I knew nothing about nutrition 

as a medical doctor.  In the four years of medical school, you don't have one single 

hour of information on nutrition.  I have talked about that and admitted that I, in the 

past, have told patients that their nutrition has really nothing to do with their health.  I 

was ignorant, I was stupid as many orthodox medical doctors are.  Fortunately, I found 

out what was really going on in the health field by coming to the Cancer Control Society, 

and I started speaking out about it, studying it and actually had a radio show called 

"Truth Serum" where I was interviewing many alternative doctors.  In the middle of that, 

I found out that I had breast cancer.  I had infiltrating ductal carcinoma and it was 

spreading through my breast.



<p>I went to my first doctor to have the lump taken out.  At that time I did not 

know it was cancer.  He refused to take care of me unless I had pre-operative 

chemotherapy.  Even though I told him that I was a physician, and that I would sign 

any papers releasing him from any legal liability - but that I didn't want chemotherapy.  I 

just wanted the lump taken out and diagnosed.  He said, No.  His reputation was at 

stake.  So, I walked out of his office realizing that the law considers it acceptable for 

a physician to abandon a patient if the patient refuses the doctor's prescription.  So I 

went to a former resident colleague, who is a breast cancer surgeon.  He took the lump 

out but he couldn't get all the cancer.  He said, 'You have to have your breast removed.' 

I refused. Then he said, 'If you don't have your breast removed, you must have radiation 

therapy.' Once again, I declined. Then he said, 'You must have chemotherapy or some 

other kind of treatment to destroy these cancer cells.' I told him, 'No.  I brought you a 

whole stack of books, if you really want to learn about cancer.  Read these books.  I 

won't have any of the orthodox treatments just take the lump out.' He said that he 

could not get all the cancer.  I said, 'Fine.  Everybody gets cancer all the time.  My 

body can take care of that!' 



<p>I immediately went home and called up Marilyn Barnes, whom you just heard 

earlier.  (Marilyn Barnes had just previously testified to her total recovery, now over 

14 years, from stage 4 melanoma as well as carcinoma in situ - cervical cancer on the 

Gerson Therapy.) [Marilyn] came to my house and set me up.  She taught a woman I 

hired how to do the Gerson Therapy.  The Gerson Therapy was going to be the basis 

of my treatment.  I started the juices, the enemas, the whole business.  In fact, I 

looked at cancer as a great adventure.  Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to take 

all the different alternatives, but I tried as many as I could.  But the Gerson Diet is 

the basis of all my treatment. I am fine.  I am healthy.  I don't have any evidence of 

cancer.  It has only been close to a year, but I have absolute confidence that I'll 

be well and healthy for many, many years to come."



<p>Dr.  Lorraine Day has impressive credentials.  She is an internationally acclaimed 

orthopedic trauma surgeon and author.  She was for 15 years on the faculty of the 

University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine as Associate Professor 

and Vice Chairman of the Department of Orthopedics.  She was also Chief of Orthopedic 

Surgery at San Francisco General Hospital and is recognized world-wide as an AIDS 

expert.  She has been invited to lecture extensively throughout the U.S.  and the 

world; appeared on numerous radio and television shows, including 60 Minutes, 

Nightline, CNN Crossfire, Oprah Winfrey, and Larry King Live.  



<p><b>NOTE:</b> With both a Japanese and an American Professor of Medicine 

rejecting orthodox treatments for their cancers and curing themselves using the 

Gerson Therapy, we now see two examples of highly placed medical  professionals 

who are willing to speak out publicly and report their recoveries on alternative 

cancer treatments.  There have been other doctors who used the Gerson Therapy 

and cured themselves but who would  not allow us to use their names, nor did 

they permit us to refer Gerson Therapy  patients to them.

<P><A NAME="juicer">
 </A> </P>
<CENTER><P><B>JUICER INFORMATION</B> </P>
</CENTER><P>Dr. Gerson was very specific in his requirements
for special equipment for the best juice extraction for
patients on the Gerson Therapy. He found, and it was later
confirmed, that centrifugal juicers are not acceptable. There
are several possible combinations of juicers that fulfill
Gerson's equirement of a separate grinder and then a press to
accomplish the best extraction: </P>
<P>NORWALK JUICER- automatic with hydraulic press connected
to the motor and effortless to operate. Cost $1995-$2095 (4
models - different finishes. New models work on 50/60 cycles.
Available at the hospital from the local distributor, or
call: Richard Boger at 1-800-405-8423, or outside USA 619 755
8423. </P>
<P>K &amp; K GRINDER &amp; PRESS - the grinder is connected
to an electric motor; the press is hand operated with a jack
and requires some strength of the arm and shoulder. Available
through Al Hasser, 14410 Big Canyon Rd, Middletown, CA 95461
Telephone 707-928-5970 (Shredder $600, Press $249 + shipping
&amp; handling or $825 + S&amp;H if ordered together) </P>
<P>CHAMPION - not used as a juicer but as a grinder only;
plus the K &amp; K press (see above). Champion cost is about
$240. Available through local health food stores.
Occasionally, the Gerson Institute has listings of secondhand
Norwalks which you may want to consider. Check with us at
(619) 585-7600. <A name="coffee">
 </A> </P>
<HR><CENTER><P><B>SOURCE FOR ORGANIC COFFEE</B> </P>
</CENTER><P>A distributor of certified organic coffee has
made special arrangements for Gerson patients to be able to
obtain organic coffee at $5.25 per pound. The name of the
firm is: Harbor House Coffee Co., P.O. Box 1879, Clearlake
Oaks, CA 95423. You can call them at 1-800-541-4699. When
ordering, to obtain the special price, mention that you are a
Gerson Patient. <A name="bread">
 </A> </P>
<HR><CENTER><P><B>GERSON THERAPY BREAD</B> </P>
</CENTER><P>Bread is allowed on the Gerson Therapy in small
amounts, not to replace a meal, but to provide a little extra
if the patient has consumed the full meal of the necessary,
building foods. It is generally best not to try to bake your
own bread because it is very time consuming. Since bread is
not such an important part of the patient's intake, it is
best to buy it ready-made. There is some organic sourdough
all-rye bread available now, without salt, which is ideal for
the Gerson patient. It is made and distributed by: Rudolph's
Specialty Bakeries, 390 Alliance Avenue, Toronto M6N 2H8,
Ontario, Canada, (800) 268 1589, and is available in health
food stores. Nature's Path Foods (an additional source we've
been advised of) carries an organic rye-carrot-raisin bread
without salt: Jim Robitaille, 916 354 1108. <A

<h2>Patricia Spain Ward</h2>

<p><img src="banner1.gif" alt="*">

<p>Patricia Spain Ward, author of "History of the Gerson Therapy", is one of a

baker's dozen best medical historians in the United States.  This paper was

originally written by Dr. Ward under a contract to the U.S. Congressional

Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) during its evaluation of alternative

methods of cancer management. This article, along with two others by Dr.

Ward, were suppressed by OTA staff until their release under pressure from

U.S. Senator Charles Grassley of the Technology Assessment Board of

Congress. Her experience with OTA, the process which led to drastic changes

in the "Unconventional Cancer Treatments" document, and her impressions of

important participants in that process, have had a significant impact on

her and on U.S. cancer medicine.

<html> <title>Programs and Financial Arrangements</title> <body
bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> <h1>Programs Available and Financial
Arrangements</h1> <p> Hospital Meridian provides a variety of
programs to accommodate individual needs.  These include 3-5 day
visits for rejuvenation or follow-up maintenance, as well as 3-6 week
programs of intensive therapy for more serious conditions.  All
hospital charges listed below are considered to be deposits against
reimbursement by useful private health insurance programs.<p>

Hospital Meridian charges include all standard therapies, normal lab
work, and most adjunctive therapies.  Some other hospitals may charge
a lower daily rate, but your billing for additional tests, adjunctive
therapies, and other services can often reach $1,000 per week.  At
Hospital Meridian, any extra charges are for extraordinary, high-cost
services such as Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation, Live Cell Therapy,
Surgical Procedures, or similar non-standard services.<p>

Our charges are $4,500 per week, or $700 per day for stays of less
than one week. We strongly encourage patients to bring a companion,
as it is very important to have a friend or family member learn
the therapy so that it may be continued at home. Patients who are
very ill or non-ambulatory may require an additional assistant, as
private nursing care is not provided.  The charge for a companion is
$44.00 per day, which includes a bed in the patient's room, 3 meals
and 3 juices.<p>

Payment may be made by cash, cashiers check, traveler's check,
American Express, Visa or MasterCard. A cash deposit of the first
week's charges will be required upon admission to the hospital.
Additional charges (if any) will be collected weekly in advance.<p>

<h3>Insurance Reimbursement:</h3>

Although Hospital Meridian does not accept insurance assignment,
Meridian Health Systems can process your health insurance claim to
assist you in receiving the maximum benefits allowable. For details,
contact the hospital administrator.  Hospital Meridian is located
just 30 minutes from downtown San Diego, California.<p>

Homeless:




</B>

</A>








<BR><B>Another






Casualty
in the Trade



Wars</B>












</H1><P>











<P><B>The homeless are everywhere and nowhere. In a nation that prides itself
on keeping statistics about every conceivable economic activity, it is remarkable





















that there is no reliable data on the extent of homelessness.  </B>












<P><B>	Everyone agrees that homelessness started a dramatic increase in the
1970s and 1980s. Republican Jack Kemp, former chairman of the Interagency
Council on the Homeless said, "Today's homelessness started to become a highly





















visible and recognized problem in many cities in the late 1970s and early
1980s."  In the 1950s and 1960s seeing a homeless person was indeed a rarity.
Now it seems you trip over them even in the best of neighborhoods.</B>












<P><B>	Who are the homeless?  Three-quarters of the homeless are single men.





















Nearly half of them are veterans. Most of these vets were once productive





















blue-collar workers who were laid off either by "downsizing" or because of
the relocation of plants overseas.</B>












<P><B>	Homelessness is next to joblessness and both are caused by our massive





















trade deficits.  In the early 1970s we did not have a trade deficit--our
exports and imports were nearly equal.  We also did not have a massive





















homelessness problem.  And then the floodgates opened.  Until 1973 we did
not trade with China at all.  We had a small trade deficit with Japan then
as the first waves of Toyotas, Hondas and Datsuns were invading our shores
in small battalions.</B>












<P><B>	The vast rise in our trade deficit is mirrored by an alarming rise
in the homeless population. Now families are joining shelters where only
males used to flee. It used to be that an American with a high school degree





















could get a decent  job with a predictable future and buy a decent home.
 Now, alarmingly, home ownership is declining for the first time in American





















history. Many of us are only one paycheck away from poverty and from losing
our homes or apartments.  Ten thousand Americans are losing their homes to





















foreclosure every month and many times that number are thrown out onto the





















streets by court-ordered evictions.</B>












<P><B>	Homelessness is one of the hidden costs of the trade wars. When American





















consumers buy cheap Chinese shoes, Malaysian clothing and Taiwanese electronics





















we are also buying unemployment and homelessness in America.  Besides losing
jobs and homes, we lose tax revenues and drain our unemployment funds.  Why
do you think that we have had federal budget deficits for the last two decades?





















 Because we are losing our tax base.  Incomes have not increased in twenty
years, they have actually declined.  We are the only major nation to suffer
this fate, so I do not blame international trade alone.  I blame the American





















government and the trade negotiators for getting us bad trade agreements
and by failing to enforce our own trade and tariff laws.</B>












<P><B>	For example, federal law provides that imported trucks are subject
to a 25% duty.  Cars are subject to a duty of only 2.5%.  The Japan lobby
has succeeded in having Toyota, Mazda, Nissan and Izusu trucks and minivans





















classified as cars for duty purposes, but as trucks for safety and other





















purposes.  The British-made Range Rover pulled the Shetland wool over somebody's





















eyes when it convinced the feds that its $60,000 off-road vehicles were trucks
in order to escape the luxury tax, but were cars to escape the truck duty.
 It should be the other way around--Rovers are certainly luxury vehicles
and should be taxed as such, and they are trucks for duty purposes.  Each
Rover should bring the federal government $10,000 or more in revenues but
brings in only about $1,000.  When Range Rovers cost a mere $40,000, Murphy
Brown said it more sense to buy a Ford Explorer and strap $20,000 in cash
to the hood--you would get the same effect.</B>












<P><B>	By circumventing import duties these imported trucks not only cost





















American jobs they cost the U.S. treasury $1.2 billion dollars annually.
 I estimate that we could build 30,000 homes for the homeless (at $40,000
each) with these revenues.  This in turn would create tens of thousands of
jobs for plumbers, carpenters, masons and others.</B>












<P><B>	Foreign corporations have found countless ways for dodging American
taxes.  Japanese and European corporations set up importing subsidiaries
in this country: Toyota of America, Mercedes Benz of North America and so
forth.  Most of these foreign corporations pay little or no income tax in
the United States.  They do this slight-of-hand trick by claiming that they
make no income here by overcharging their own subsidiaries.  Their accountants





















miraculously transfer profits back to Tokyo or Munich or London.  The Internal





















Revenue Service has tried unsuccessfully to go after these companies because
many Japanese parent corporations refuse to turn over documents to the U.S.





















government.  President Clinton promised to close this gaping loophole, but
has not done so thus far.  This loophole costs American taxpayers tens of





















billions of dollars every year, strengthens our trade opponents and makes





















balancing the U.S. budget that much harder.   </B>












<P><B>	Without changing our laws, just by enforcing existing laws, we can
turn the trade war around.  The symptoms of our trade deficits are everywhere
to be found.  Next time you see a homeless person, let him inspire you to
write your congressman or the president and strengthen your desire to buy
only American products. Most homeless people are casualties of our trade
wars and should be constant reminders that we are in a battle for economic





















survival.</B>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#3f3f3f" TEXT="#ffffff" LINK="#808000">
<H1>
  Squeezing Children to Make Orange Juice, Tomatoes and Rasberries
</H1>
<P>
<P>
<B>While oranges, tomatoes and raspberries are loaded with vitamin C, they
can often be harmful to children. Though doctors recommend eating fruits
and vegetables, few would recommend that young children work in hot fields
picking and packing them. Yet thousands of children pick oranges in Mexico
and Brazil, tomatoes in Mexico and raspberries in Guatemala. These fruits
and vegetables are widely available at your neighborhood grocery store, but
are not usually marked with their country of origin.</B>
<P>
<B> Brazilian and Mexican orange juice is pouring into many juice products
that appear to be American. A number of American companies hide their imported
juices, including those made from oranges picked by children, in juices made
from concentrate. Tropicana fresh juices are made by adults in Florida, while
Tropicana orange juice from concentrate contains oranges picked by children
in Brazil and Mexico. Similarly, FloridaGold orange juice from concentrate
contains Brazilian juice, squeezed from the labor out of young children.
</B>
<P>
<B> A complaint was filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concerning
FloridaGold orange juice's deception of consumers about its country of origin.
But the FDA didn't think mislabeling of orange juice was a matter of public
importance and has allowed the complaint to languish.</B>
<P>
<B> But consider this: According to the United States Department of Labor,
children picking and boxing oranges in Brazil are paid $3.00 for working
a 14-hour day, or 21 cents per hour. Tomatoes from Mexico are allowed to
contain the unhealthy pesticide DDT, though the United States banned the
use of DDT on tomatoes and other agricultural products more than ten years
ago. While the federal government warns Americans not to eat fresh fruits
and vegetables in Mexico, and South and Central America, this same produce
is sold at grocery stores across the United States.</B>
<P>
<B> Not only are many agricultural imports picked by children, they may also
be tainted with dangerous parasites and bacteria. Recently the source of
cyclosporin was traced by the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) to
raspberries grown in Guatemala. Because of cyclosporin infections from these
raspberries more than 850 Americans became ill, suffering from severe diarrhea.
The CDC points to contamination in the water in Guatemala as the likely source
for this infection. This jibes with the State Department's warning to travelers
in Central and South America to avoid eating fruits and vegetables from all
these countries except Chile, Argentina and Uruguay. The State Department
warns: "Diarrhea caused by contaminated food or water is potentially
serious."</B>
<P>
<B> The unsafe and unsanitary working conditions under which young children
are laboring can be hazardous to their health and to your own health. Both
your conscience and your stomach should be wary of consuming fresh produce
and juices from Mexico, Central and South America.</B>
<P>
<B> If the government warns you not to drink the water or eat fresh fruits
and vegetables when you travel to Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil, shouldn't
consumers be warned to avoid the very same fruits and vegetables when imported
into the United States? At a minimum, the federal government should require
that grocery stores label fruits and vegetables with their country of origin
so that consumer are fairly warned and can avoid possibly disease-laden
produce.</B>
<P>
<B> In addition, many of the contaminated raspberries from Guatemala were
picked by children. But it not the children that make these berries dangerous,
it's the unsanitary conditions under which they are grown. Often sanitation
is rudimentary. Outhouses are near the fields and many illnesses are spread
by these unhygienic conditions.</B>
<P>
<B> The related problems of child labor and unsafe produce needs to be attacked
on several levels. First of all, Congress should pass a law banning the
importation of products made by children under the age of 15. Congressman
Chris Smith (R. N.J.) has recently introduced this legislation (H.R. 3812)
which would enact this ban. This bill has been sponsored by six members of
Congress, three Democrats and three Republicans. </B>
<P>
<B> Secondly, federal law should require the clear labelling of all produce
for its country of origin. No legislation is currently being considered to
require this consumer notification, but consumer groups are now working on
various proposals. Write to your Congressman and Senator voicing your approval
of the legislation which prohibits the importation of products made by children.
Support legislation requiring country of origin information on fresh fruits
and vegetables. And drink your orange juice fresh squeezed.</B>

<TITLE>NFL Owners</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff" TEXT="#000000"><P><B>We encourage you to print out or cut and paste the letter below, and mail or e-mail it to your football team's owner, telling him or her that you believe NFL products should be manufactured in America by Americans.</B>

<P>

<P><A HREF="#state">Statement of Purpose</A>

<P><A HREF="#letter">Letter to the NFL Owners</A>

<P><A HREF="#list">List and addresses of NFL Owners</A>

<P>

<P><HR>

<P>

<P><B><A NAME=state>There's nothing </A>better than cool autumn Sundays spent watching professional football at the stadium or in the comfort of your own living room. Everyone has their favorite team. Maybe you grew up outside of Philadelphia and are a diehard Eagles fan. Or maybe you had a favorite player like Unitas, or Starr, or Bradshaw who seemed to carry their entire team on their back, and so their team became your team. </B>

<P><B>And maybe you have that old jersey your father gave you, the jersey that made you proud to be associated with that player or team, and with football in general. But one thing has changed. </B>

<P><B>Now when you go to give your son or daughter a t-shirt or hat bearing their favorite team's logo&nbsp;look at the label. Where you might expect to find the words "Made in the USA," you now see "Made in China" or "Made in Bangladesh." Professional football has become this country's most popular sport, and its atheletes make more money than many Americans could hope to spend in a lifetime. Players and owners like Deion Sanders and Art Modell tell us that football has become a business, and what matters is the bottom line.</B>

<P><B>We at the Made in the USA Foundation believe in a different conception of football. We still see it as a "sport" which brings families and friends together, encouraging friendly rivalries and spirited good times. &nbsp;Many of football's most loyal fans, however, are hard-working individuals our country's manufacturing sector. Yet as more and more manufacturing is shipped overseas, these men and women rightfully fear losing their jobs. So we at the Made in the USA Foundation call on the NFL's owners to re-evaluate their priorities, and bring the production of their goods back to the United States. Please copy or print out the letter below and send it to your team's owner. The fans can make a difference.</B>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P><HR>

<P>

<P><B><A NAME=letter>Dear</A></B>

<P><B>Football is truly an all-American sport.  As you know, Wilson still makes the official NFL football in Ada, Ohio in the heartland of the country.  As a supporter of the Made in the USA Foundation, I would like to encourage teams and the NFL to have more souvenirs and equipment manufactured in the United States.  We want you to join us as well.</B>

<P><B>A large majority of NFL fans like myself want to buy U.S.-made products.    But by importing NFL-logo products, the National Football League and its teams are turning off the fans, the lifeblood of the sport.  These fans now are refusing to buy imported souvenirs and have become irritated by the lack of choice.   I believe that it is in the owners' long-term interests to keep fans supportive and enthusiastic.</B>

<P><B>For every player who makes it to the NFL there are literally thousands who don't make the grade. Unfortunately, many of these athletes are unemployed or are employed in low-wage jobs.   In this tough job market we need to keep Americans working at productive jobs.  The backbone of our economy has always been manufacturing.  Making NFL-logo products in the USA will not by itself turn the economy around, but it is an important symbolic step to creating jobs in the United States.</B>

<P><B>Please help us convince the league that NFL licensed and authorized products should be required to be made in the USA.</B>

</H3><H3><P ALIGN=Center><B>Testimony of</B>




</H3><H3><P ALIGN=Center><B>Joel D. Joseph</B>




</H3><H3><P ALIGN=Center><B>Chairman</B>




</H3><H3><P ALIGN=Center><B>Made in the USA Foundation</B>




</H3><H3><P ALIGN=Center><B>April 10, 1996</B>




</H3><P>	




<P><B>	The Made in the USA Foundation represents 60,000 Americans who want

to buy American-made products, as well as manufactures of those products

and labor unions whose workers make products here.  The Made in the USA label

is an important marketing tool in the United States and overseas and we want

that label to mean something.  We want it to mean the same thing across the




country, from agency to agency and around the world.</B>




<P><B>	My name is Joel Joseph.  In addition to serving as Chairman of the




Foundation, I am a lawyer and an economist.	There are many deceptive practices




being used by companies trying to appear to be U.S. manufacturers.  The U.S.

Lock Company, for example, does not make locks in the United States.  FloridaGold




orange juice may come from Brazil:  The label states that the product conducts




orange juice from Florida and/or Brazil.  But what is it?  Florida juice

or Brazilian juice?  American consumers, and consumers from around the world,




have the right to know.</B>




<P><B>	The European Commission recently proposed that certain food products

were so closely associated with geographical locations that the names would

be protected and no one outside of that nation or region could use the name.




</B>




<P><B>Just last month the European Commission proposed 318 protected names




including:  Prosciutto di Parma (Italy), Roquefort cheese (France), Fontina




cheese (Italy), Stilton cheese (England), Newcastle Brown Ale (England) and

Feta cheese (Greece).  The European Commission stated that it is unfair




competition for producers outside of these regions to use geographical names




associated with particular products.  We at the Made in the USA Foundation




wholeheartedly agree.</B>




<P><B>	We similarly don't want Florida orange juice to come from any other

place.  We want Idaho potatoes from Idaho, Long Island duckling from Long

Island and Vermont maple syrup from Vermont.   Maple Grove Farms of Vermont

sells maple syrup that may be from Vermont or maybe from Canada. The label

is clearly deceptive.  </B>




<P><B>	There is a case pending before the courts in the United States about

Swiss Army knives that are made in China.  I don't believe that the Swiss

Army has ever left that country, and most certainly never made it to China.

 Most Americans would assume that a Swiss Army knife was made in Switzerland.




</B>




<P><B>Switzerland is known for its skill in making precision instruments.

 The Made in the USA Foundation supports the Swiss manufacturer in its claim

that Swiss Army knives can only be made in Switzerland. </B>




<P><B>	Similarly, Americans and others would assume that Milwaukee tools

are made in Milwaukee, that Virginia hams come from Virginia and that Rockport




shoes come from Rockport.  Milwaukee tools are indeed made in Wisconsin and




Virginia pigs are the source of Virginia hams, but Rockport shoes are made




elsewhere.  Similarly L.A. Gear shoes are not made in Los Angeles, although

most consumers would believe that L.A. Gear products are made in Southern




California.  American cities, states and regions deserve the same respect

as those in Europe--if a manufacturer wants to use an American geographical

name it must manufacture the product here.</B>




<P><B> 	The liquor industry has protected regional product names for many

years.  Scotch whiskey can only come from Scotland and Bourbon can only be

made in Kentucky.  </B>




<P><B>	Turning to clothing, many manufacturers virtually wrap themselves

in the American flag, which they have imported from the Pacific rim.  Perry

Ellis flaunts his "America Series" of imported clothing.  If something is

called "American," then it should come from America.  And if not, the label




should certainly state in large letters, as large as the reference to America,




that the product is made elsewhere.  Tommy Hilfiger similarly promotes his




American style clothing, but few know that his "American" products are




imported.</B>




<P><B>	Perry Ellis and Tommy Hilfiger often use the American flag in their




designs.  Use of the American flag conveys the message that the product is




American-made.  But often, if the shopper notices the microscopic country

of origin label, he or she may notice that the product is an import.  Like

a geographic reference, use of an American flag denotes country of origin.</B>




<P><B>	How about American flags themselves?  In 1994, 850,000 U.S. flags

were imported, mostly from Taiwan and China.  In your recommendations to

Congress the Foundation proposes that the importation of American flags be




prohibited.  Similarly, clothing and other articles which include an American




flag, such as pins, buttons, hats and so forth, should be included in the




prohibition.  I challenge any Member of Congress to vote against this




proposal.</B>




<P><B>	When a product uses the name American it implies manufacture in this




country.  "American Classic" shoes, especially when dressed up in red and

white stripes and white stars on a blue background, shouts out: "Made in

the USA."  But quietly such products whisper in 6 point type: "Made in China."




</B>




<P><B>This is clearly a deceptive country of origin marking.  In fact, I

cannot conceive of a more deceptive label or package.</B>




<P><B>	What does made in the USA mean?  Before the Federal Trade Commission

we proposed that Made in the USA means 75% U.S. content (parts and labor




together) on a cost of goods sold basis with final assembly in the United

States.  A lesser standard of 50% was proposed for the label "Assembled in

the USA."</B>




<P><B>	The Foundation also believes that "Made in Italy" or "Made in Japan"




should meet those same high standards.  Now, I understand that shoes can

carry the "Made in Italy" label when the uppers are made in Romania and the

soles come from Taiwan.  Only the final assembly was done in Italy.  This

is blatantly unfair to American consumers and competitors.  "Made in Italy"

on a pair of shoes means quality to many consumers.  A fair label for these




hypothetical shoes may be "Uppers Made in Romania, Soles Made in Taiwan,

Final Assembly in Italy."</B>




<P><B>	Similarly, a VCR can now carry a "Made in Japan" label that was only




assembled in that country.  For example, all of the parts may have come from




Taiwan (40%), Malaysia (30%) and Hong Kong (15%).  If that is the case the

label should fairly read: "Components made in Taiwan, Malaysia and Hong Kong,




Final Assembly in Japan."  The order on the label should be in descending

order of where most of the content came from.</B>




<P><B>	Computers are truly an international product.  No computer that I

am aware of comes 100% from any one country.  This is one type of product

that should have a more precise label.  In the United States, the Foundation




proposed similar requirements for automobile labeling which (with one amendment)




became the American Automobile Labeling Act.  Every new car sold in the United




States is required to include a label which states the U.S. and Canadian

content, where the engine was made, where the transmission was made and where




final assembly took place.  </B>




<P><B>	The Foundation proposes that computers be labeled as follows:</B>




<P><B>		1.  Country with most content: _____%  (e.g. Japanese Content X%

or U.S. Content X%)</B>




<P><B>		2.  Monitor made in ______________.</B>




<P><B>		3.  Mouse made in _______________.</B>




<P><B>		4.  Keyboard made in ____________.</B>




<P><B>		5.  Central Processing Unit made in ___________.</B>




<P><B>		6.  Final assembly in _______________________.</B>




<P><B>	In summary, the Made in the USA Foundation wants consumers to be informed




accurately about the country of origin.  Information necessary for simple

items is different than that needed for a car or a computer.  And the label




should be accessible.  To the dismay of many store employees,  I have turned

VCRs and computers upside down to find a country of origin label. </B>




<P><B>These labels should be on the front of the product or on the price

sticker.  No label should leave any doubt.  Don't allow manufacturers or




importers to say: "may contain contents from the following countries."  This

is not a country of origin label--it is per se an unfair and deceptive practice




that is rampant. </B>




<P><B>&nbsp;I would like to thank the Commission for providing me with




anopportunity to present the views of the Made in the USA Foundation.</B>

</HEAD><BODY LINK="#ff0000" VLINK="#408080" BACKGROUND="blue1.gif"><TABLE border=0 width="100%"><TR><TD width=150 valign=top align=left>

</TD><TD width=350 valign=top align=left><H1><B>Corporate Mobsters: <BR>Phil

Knight, Nike and the Mafia</B>


</H1><P>


<P><B>Phil Knight is the godfather of the Nike Mafia. Knight started Nike

in the 1960s with a $500 investment and is now worth $4.5 billion because

of his successful, ruthless strong-arm tactics.  He has built his massive

empire on worker exploitation and child labor, coupled with massive payoffs

to superstars like Michael Jordan to pimp for his products. Nike has paid

off the U.S. Olympic Committee, major colleges and their coaches, and well-known


players and celebrities to solicit impressionable children to buy its products.


Nike bought Michael Jordan for $20 million, but its hundred-million dollar

Cosa Nostra spokesmodels include Andre Agassi, Spike Lee, Pete Sampras, Dennis


Rodman and the Dallas Cowboys. </B>


<P><B>Nike was named one of the worst ten corporations in the world by the


Multinational Monitor, but it is far worse than a bad corporate citizen.

It is corrupt and corrupting our youth and the nation. While ten-year-olds

made Nike products for peanuts in the Third World, teenagers in this country

are shooting each other for their Nike shoes.</B>


<P><B>The Nike Mafia operates primarily in those countries that tolerate

worker exploitation and bribery, including South Korea, Indonesia, Pakistan,


China, and Vietnam. The Progressive said "Labor in Indonesia is cheap, after

all- so cheap that it costs an employer less to hire uniformed goons to rough

up would-be labor activists than to negotiate."  When labor got too expensive

in Korea, Nike picked up and left, continuing to use its Korean thugs to

run operations in Indonesia. This allows Nike to deny hiring child labor

and operating sweat shops by saying, "We just don't do it- the Koreans own

the plant."</B>


<P><B>Even Nike apologist Donald Katz, who wrote a puff piece on the company


called "Just Do It" explained the Nike system:  "Management by terror and


browbeating led to strikes by  Indonesian workers who were fed up with former


South Korean Tiger Division types yelling at them. It was suggested that

some of the authoritarian managers from Pussan might have been acting out


frustrations with Korean line workers whose demands for better pay were chasing


the domestic shoe scene away. 'They yell at us when we don't make the production


quotas and if we talk back they cut our wages,' one female line worker at

an Indonesian factory making Nikes told a reporter for the Far Eastern Economic


Review."  Sweltering in 90 degree heat, a young female worker named Eni dabs


paint on the soles of freshly moulded shoes. Presses thump at a deafening

pace while glue and rubber burns young lungs. But the Nike advertisement

posted on the wall next to her admonishes, "Just Do It."  Eni said, "If we

made a mistake, they call us dogs and prostitutes and sometimes they hit

us." </B>


<P><B>Workers in Indonesia have protested the abominable working conditions,


exhausting overtime, and child labor. When they complain, Nike's henchman

have the workers fired. Of course these practices are illegal in the United


States, but Nike does little production work where workers have rights. Even

in Indonesia, Nike has lost a court case when it fired protesting workers.

One major case against Nike's lieutenants is now before the Indonesian Supreme


Court.</B>


<P><B>The Nike College mafia is corrupting our universities and students.

Nike buys college coaches, like Georgetown's John Thompson, who requires

his amateur players to wear Nike shoes.  Other colleges have done the same,


shilling for Nike, intoxicating impressionable youngsters into believing

that wearing Nikes is the key to an NBA or college basketball future. The

U.S. Olympic Committee prostituted itself by selling Nike the right to call


itself an Olympic sponsor.  The &nbsp;USOC sells sponsorships to the highest


bidder, working conditions be damned. The Olympic Committee prays to the

altar of the almighty dollar without regard to where a company makes its


products.</B>


<P><B>Nike is a hollow company, much the way that the Mafia is hollow.  Neither


actually produces anything. They both use their money and muscle to take

what others have made by the sweat of their brow.  Nike has others make shoes

for it in Indonesia and elsewhere for $5.  These same shoes retail for $100

or more.  This is not unlike the Mafia buying illegal drugs and marking them

up by 2000%.  Street value for shoes bears a striking similarity to street

value for crack cocaine. For inner city kids they are the only games in


town.</B>


<P><B>A few brave souls have stood up to the Nike Mafia.   One of those is

my nominee for hero of the year:  Joseph Tam. Tam grew up in Hong Kong where

as a child he made little plastic flowers and plastic Christmas trees in

a sweatshop. Now Tam is a member of the Portland, Oregon School Board. When

he learned that Nike was using six-year old Pakistani children to stitch

soccer balls for six cents an hour, he told Nike that he didn't want their


$500,000 contribution. "I asked myself," he said, "Nike contributed this

money so my children can have a better education, but at whose expense? At

the expense of children who work for six cents an hour? Children were beaten

and branded. One child only wanted to see his mother." </B>


<P><B>Nike, in order to counter the bad press it is getting for using sweatshops


and child labor, set up a phoney organization called PLAY: Participate in

the Lives of American Youth.  The only way Nike participates in the lives

of American youth is buying millions of dollars in ads targeted to children

to buy their overpriced, overrated sneakers.  </B>


<P><B>Nike will keep doing it to us until we do it to them.  The only way

to do it to Nike is to Just Say No.  Like Joseph Tam did.  Don't take dirty

money from Nike and don't buy their products.</B>

</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H1>
  <B>U.S. EXPO '97</B>
</H1>
<P>
<P>
<B>We are excited to announce that the All American Made Products Exhibition
U.S. EXPO '97 will be held on March 17-21, 1997 in Amman, Jordan. The expo
is certain to be the focal point for buyers and distributors throughout the
Middle East and Arab Gulf States. Encompassing an area whose market value
has risen to over $33.3 billion annually, the Middle East and Gulf States
have become one the major areas for business opportunities in the world today.
Indeed the buyers at the expo will represent the fastest growing economic
region in the world.</B>
<P>
<B>The Kingdom of Jordan is strategically positioned as a gateway to the
rest of the Middle East. Its economic stability, security and strategic location
put Jordan in an ideal position as a commercial, communication and industrial
platform. In addition, with its three free zones, the Amman market offers
a connection to trade throughout the region. All these factors indicate a
great market potential that cannot be ignored. The expo serves as an excellent
opportunity for American manufacturers to promote their products for export
in the Middle East.</B>
<P>
<B>This event has been organized by U.S. EXPO '97, an American company based
in California with a branch in Jordan, in conjunction with a long established
Jordanian exhibition company. A large number of professional buyers from
across the Middle East will be visiting the expo, and an extensive media
campaign will be run throughout the countries of the region. The buying capacity
has a market of 10,000 companies requiring new consumer products and modern
technology, so the demand for American goods is large. </B>
<P>
<B>The Amman International Expo Center is located on the main highway towards
the Jordan International Airport. With a total area of 76,000 feet, the center
offers a full range of interior and exterior facilities, as well as parking
for over 1000 cars. 300 booth spaces will be sold for the event. The Expo
Center is only minutes way from all major services, including banks, hotels,
restaurants, communications, trade and advisory institutions, and transportation.
</B>
<P>
<B>Opening ceremonies will commence at 11 AM on March 17, 1997, at the Amman
International Expo Center under the patronage of His Majesty King Hussein.
The Minister of Business Development and Trade, ambassadors, trade counselors,
government officials and leading members of the Middle East business community
will also be in attendance. </B>
<P>
<B>For more information on how to become a corporate participant in U.S.
EXPO '97, please contact Joel Joseph or Denis Gaynor of the Made in the USA
Foundation at (202) 822-6060, or by fax at (202) 822-6062. Or send e-mail

<H1><B> American Beer and Wine</B>


</H1><P>


<P><B>The American market for beer and wine is one of the most open in the

world. The U.S. charges a relatively small duty-  13 cents a case- on imported


beer. Other nations charge a great deal more. For example, Holland, Germany

and England charge U.S. companies $2.93 a case to export beer into their


countries. China charges U.S. exporters an extraordinary duty of $14 a case.

For years, our Canadian neighbor refused to allow U.S. beer to be sold in

its provinces. Wine duties are similarly discriminatory against American


products. </B>


<P><B>So every time you order or purchase beer or wine, think about the unfair


treatment U.S. brewers receive overseas and choose American.</B>


<P><B><HR></B>


<H2><B>Great (and Good) American Beers</B>


</H2><P>


<P><B>One of the most exciting developments in the U.S. beer industry has

been the arrival within the past 10 years of several dozen so-called


"micro-breweries," most of which are wholeheartedly devoted to producing

quality beers that can compete with the top offerings from Germany, Holland,


England, Ireland and Belgium. </B>


<P><B>Many of these micro-breweries make their beers under contract with

already existing breweries. Once the brand is established, however, many

of these initially mom-and-pop operations graduate to their own facilities.


Indeed, two of the finest producers, Boston Brewing Co., the producer of

Sam Adams beers, and New Amsterdam Beer started as contract breweries, but

have since opened up their own breweries. </B>


<P><B>Like the rest of the world's beers, American beers can be divided into

two major types. Bottom fermenting beers, which include the familiar pilsener,


ambers and bocks, are made from yeasts that settle to the bottom during


fermentation. Top fermenting beers, which include ales, porters and stouts,

are made from floating yeasts and tend to be fuller and heartier and deeper


colored than bottom fermenters.</B>


<P><B>Though there are vast numbers of American beers worth trying, the following


is my list of standouts, in order of quality. (The type of beer and location

of brewing are indicated in parentheses.)</B>


<P>


<P><B>1) <I>Samuel Adams Boston Lager</I> (amber, Massachusetts)</B>


<P><B>2) <I>Sierra Nevada Pale Ale </I>(ale)</B>


<P><B>3) <I>Anchor Steam Beer </I>(amber, California)</B>


<P><B>4) <I>Collin County Pure Gold </I>(pilsener, Texas)</B>


<P><B>5) <I>Boulder Extra Pale Ale </I>(ale, Colorado)</B>


<P><B>6) <I>Collin County Black Gold </I>(boch, Texas)</B>


<P><B>7) <I>Sierra Nevada Summerfest</I> (amber, California)</B>


<P><B>8) <I>Kessler Bock</I> (bock, Montana)</B>


<P><B>10) <I>Boulder Porter</I> (porter, Colorado)</B>


<P><B>11) <I>Dock Street Beer</I> (Philadelphia)</B>


<P><B>12) <I>New Amsterdam</I> (amber, New York)</B>

</HEAD><BODY LINK="#ff0000" VLINK="#408080" BACKGROUND="blue1.gif"><TABLE border=0 width="100%"><TR><TD width=150 valign=top align=left>

</TD><TD width=350 valign=top align=left><H1><A NAME=free><B>The










Free Trade Bill of Rights</B>

</A>










</H1><P>











<P><B>Free trade never existed.   Free trade is a myth that fuels political





















debate and drains the U.S. economy.  In order for there to be real free (and





















fair) trade in the world, all nations must agree to certain ground rules.
  During the past half-century, the United States has developed a set of
rules for factories and workers, establishing a high standard of living,
good environmental and occupational safety and health laws, minimum wages
and maximum hours of work.  We fought a devastating war to stop slavery.
 But all of our standards are being undermined by trading "freely" with nations





















that don't have a high regard for human rights, disregard the rights of children





















and scorn the rights of workers.</B>












<P><B>	For example, we can't have free trade with a nation that has slave
labor.  Or child labor.  Similarly, we can't have free trade with a nation
that discriminates against the importation of American products.  The General





















Agreement on Tariffs and Trade purports to be the international ground rules
for free trade, but it is nothing of the kind.  It not only allows child
labor, but actually prohibits nations from banning the importation of goods
made by 10 year olds. </B>












<P><B>	I have been called a protectionist for opposing unlimited free trade.
 We must protect the values that we have developed over the last fifty years
and if this is protectionism,  I wear that label with pride.  However, I
believe that we should trade with other nations, so long as the trade is
truly free.  In order to have real free trade we must have free workers,
not child laborers.  Henry Ford said that he paid his workers well so that
they could afford to buy his products. Similarly, we want foreign workers
to be paid well so that they can afford to purchase fine American products.





















 </B>












<P><B>	Here is the Free Trade Bill of Rights, which should serve as a standard





















for other nations seeking to trade with the United States.  As the world's





















leading manufacturer, and the only superpower, we should flex our muscles,
using access to the largest consumer market as leverage for making the playing





















field level.</B>












<P><B><I>	Article One</I>.   Democracy.   The right of the people to vote
in elections for their representative government shall not be infringed.
 [Workers in totalitarian nations, like China, are not free workers.]</B>












<P><B>	<I>Article Two</I>.  Freedom of Speech and Assembly.   The right of
the people to speak freely and to assemble shall not be infringed.  This
article includes the right to advertise products for sale and to compare
products in these advertisements.  [Many countries, including Germany, prohibit





















certain comparative ads.]</B>












<P><B><I>	Article Three</I>.  Prohibition of Child Labor.   Children under
the age of fifteen shall have the right to an education and be free from
coerced labor.  [There are two hundred million children under the age of
15 "employed" around the world, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil
and many other nations.  Many of these children are sold into slavery and
chained to machines.]</B>












<P><B>	<I>Article Four</I>.  Prohibition of Slave Labor.   No person shall
be forced to work or sold into slavery.  Prison labor shall be permitted,





















however, the export of goods made by prison laborers shall be prohibited.
 [China uses prison labor for exports, including political prisoners]</B>












<P><B><I>	Article Five</I>.  Trade Unions Protected.  Free and unfettered
trade unions shall be protected to the fullest extent of the law.  All persons





















shall be allowed to join the trade union of their choice and shall not be





















retaliated against for joining a union or for soliciting others to join or
to form a trade union.</B>












<P><B><I>	Article Six</I>.  Environmental Protection.  Emissions from factories





















and agricultural chemicals shall be controlled to the maximum extent possible.





















 Environmental laws of the United States shall be the international standard,
but any nation shall be free to establish stricter standards.  [Pesticides,
such as DDT which is banned in the United States, are now imported on Mexican





















tomatoes.]</B>












<P><B><I>	Article Seven</I>.  Worker Safety and Health.  The safety and health
of workers shall be protected to the maximum extent possible.  The occupational





















safety and health laws of the United States shall be the international standard,





















but any nation shall be free to establish stricter standards.</B>












<P><B>	<I>Article Eight</I>.  Minimum Wages and Maximum Hours.  Factory and





















agricultural workers shall be entitled to reasonable wages, in no event less
than one-fourth of the hourly minimum wage in the United States.  [This means





















that manufacturing wages will rise in the Third World to $1 per hour or more,





















giving these workers the ability to buy American products.  Now workers in
Nike plants in Indonesia, for example, are paid 14 cents per hour and cannot





















afford to buy the shoes that they produce.]</B>












<P><B>	No worker shall be compelled to work more than forty-eight hours per
week.  [The United States adopted the 40-hour work week decades ago, while





















Germany and France have even shorter work weeks.] </B>












<P><B><I>	Article Nine</I>.  Barriers to Trade.  No nation shall discriminate





















against imports from the United States nor impose other barriers to trade.
 [Most nations impose more trade barriers than the United States.  Many nations





















have more favorable trade rules for other nations than for the United States





















causing  tariffs and duties that discriminate against American goods.]</B>












<P><B>	<I>Article Ten</I>.  Illicit Trade Prohibited.  Nations shall not
trade illicit drugs, poisonous chemicals or materials capable of being used
in nuclear weapons or in chemical or biological weapons.  [When an outlaw
nation provides others with deadly materials, the United States and other
nations have every right to ban trade with that country.  Currently, China
has been caught by the CIA with selling nuclear equipment to Pakistan.  This





















provision would allow the United States to punish China with trade





















sanctions.]</B>












<P><B>	When someone asks you about Free Trade, be prepared with tough questions





















about slave labor, child labor and human rights.  Free trade only works if





















everyone plays by the same rules.</B>

<H2><A NAME=child><B>Child Labor Around the World</B>



</A>


</H2><P>






<P><B>Recently your Mom or Dad bought you a new soccer ball. There is a good









chance that the ball was made by someone younger than yourself. Fully half
of the soccer balls sold in the United States are made in Pakistan, and every
one of those soccer balls had an assist from a child under 14 who toils 10
hours a day in subhuman sweatshops, stitching the ball or cutting material
used to make it.</B>






<P><B>This is not an isolated problem. More than 200 million children worldwide,












some as young as four and five years old, are slaves to the production line.
Most of these children work in Asia, especially the nations of India, Pakistan,












Bangladesh and Indonesia, but Latin America is guilty of this human rights
abuse as well. India alone employs 50 million children between the ages of
10 and 14. </B>






<P><B>These unfortunate children manufacture shoes, matches, clothing, rugs
and countless other products that are flooding the American market and driving












hard-working Americans out of jobs. More than 60 years ago the United States












banned child labor, sweatshops, long workdays and workweeks. But now we are












subsidizing, encouraging and failing to criticize the enslavement of young
people in the Third World. </B>






<P><B>Indian and Pakistani rug makers love child workers so much that they
buy
them. That's right, children are bought and sold for cash or for the settlement












of a debt. Iqbal Masih was sold into slavery when he was only four years
old. His Pakistani parents, desperate for money, sold their young son for
less than $16. For six years he was shackled to a carpet-weaving loom most
of the time, tying tiny knots 10 hours a day. </B>






<P><B>Carpetmakers like the young weavers because their tiny fingers can
make
very tight knots, and also because they are cheap to own and maintain. Masih
was a free person by the age of 12 and crusaded against the horrors of child












labor. In November 1994 Iqbal spoke out on the abysmal conditions in the
sweat shops of Pakistan at the international labor conference in Stockholm,












Sweden. The next month, he was given a Youth Action award in Boston. Shockingly,












in March 1995 he was shot and killed in his village in Pakistan while riding
his bicycle. Eshan Khan, chairman of the Bonded Labor Front, a group fighting












child labor, said, "We know his death was a conspiracy by the carpet mafia."









</B>






<P><B>Only a boycott by the United States and other nations will have any
impact
on slave-based industries like the rug manufacturers. Nike similarly bases
its operations on finding the lowest-cost labor to make its athletic shoes.












Twelve-year-old girls work in Indonesian sweatshops 70 hours a week making
Nikes in unhealthy plants that reek of glue. Blue jeans and cheap clothing
made in Bangladesh wind up on the shelves of American shops like K-Mart and












Wal-Mart.The United States needs to take a leadership role in eradicating
child labor around the globe. </B>






<P><B>Child labor is a human rights issue. What is more of a human right
than



growing up a free person, attending school without being shackled to medieval












machinery? Please remember every time you go shopping and see a label that
says made in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia or Indonesia, that
a 10-year-old prisoner of a feudal manufacturer probably contributed his
or her labor to that product.Don't buy it. Tell the store why you won't buy












clothing and other products from these backward nations. Tell your Senator,












Congressman and presidential candidates that we should oppose the cruelest
abuse of human rights: child labor. </B>

</A>(C.A.U.S.E.) ?</B>






</H2><P>






<P><B>C.A.U.S.E. is a group of American children who are opposed to the












exploitation
of children in Third World countries. We believe that children should be
in school, not in factories. We believe that poor countries can only escape
from their poverty by education of their children. Child labor only continues
the cycle of poverty.</B>






<P><B>The basic premise of C.A.U.S.E. is that strong and effective action



must
be taken to reduce child labor around the world.</B>

<TITLE>Olympic Greed</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY LINK="#ff0000" VLINK="#408080" BACKGROUND="blue1.gif"><TABLE border=0 width="100%"><TR><TD width=150 valign=top align=left>

</TD><TD width=350 valign=top align=left><H1>Greed of Olympic Proportions



</H1><P>



<P><B>The unparalleled greed of the U.S. Olympic Committee has forced many



American companies to source Olympic products overseas.   The demands of

the Olympic Committee for multi-million dollar up-front payments and guarantees



has virtually assured that most U.S. Olympic souvenirs are imported from

low-wage countries, and from countries where child labor is rampant.</B>



<P><B>	J.C. Penney and Champion are the official suppliers of Olympic T-shirts,



jackets and hats. Together they paid about $40 million to the U.S. Olympic



Committee, a handsome fee which will be used to pay for the Atlanta Games.

 It is a disgrace to see excellent American manufacturers like Champion forced

to go overseas.  But these massive payments have forced these suppliers to

shop for the cheapest sources around the globe in order to have a profit

margin large enough to offset the Olympic-class royalties.  And the cheapest



sources of labor are often children working in sweatshops in Latin America

and Asia.</B>



<P><B>	The vendors of Olympic products are not doing as well as planned.

 The vendors in Atlanta and around the United States are complaining that



consumers are not buying the overpriced Olympic wares.  </B>



<P><B>Apparently, shortsighted manufacturers and retailers assumed that it



doesn't matter where these products are made.  But fully 40% of the American



consumers will not buy imported clothing.  The percentage may even be higher

for sales of  patriotic paraphernalia such as U.S. Olympic hats and jackets.



 </B>



<P><B>	The U.S. Olympic Committee shares in both the revenue and the blame

for consumers reluctance to buy U.S. Olympic hats for $16 that are made in



Taiwan.  The U.S. Olympic Committee could require products using the Olympic



symbols to be made in the USA.  But it will take an act of Congress to make

sure the next round of Olympic souvenirs are made in the USA. </B>



<P><B>	The current Olympic law, 36 U.S.C. 380,  is printed on official Olympic



labels and appears in television commercials.  Under that law the U.S. Olympic



Committee has the authority to set product standards and can require products



wearing the U.S. Olympic Committee label to be made in the USA.  </B>



<P><B>But the Committee has only used its authority to accept the highest

bid for sponsorship.  The Made in the USA Foundation is drafting legislation

that would require sponsors of the U.S. Olympic Teams to be American



manufacturers or service providers.  This will end embarrassments such as

the Japanese-made Suburu being the official car of the U.S. Ski Team.</B>



<P><B>	While the U.S. Olympic Committee urges consumers to "buy the real

thing," its activities have virtually insured that the "real thing" is made

is a Third World country.  The official Olympic T-shirt sold at J.C. Penney

for $16 and $17 is made by Champion but stitched in Costa Rica.  The U.S.



Department of Labor confirms that there are many child laborers in Costa

Rica. Olympic pants ($24) and Olympic jacket ($35), under the J.C. Penney

label, are made in Malaysia.  U.S. Department of Labor investigators have

been to Malaysia documenting child labor in many industries. </B>



<P><B>Another Olympic jacket under the Penney label is made in Hong Kong.

 The USA Olympic hat with five Olympic rings that is made in Taiwan sells

for $16 at Penney's.  Thirty-eight members of Congress wrote to the Olympic



Committee complaining that adidas soccerballs to be used in the Atlanta Games



were made by young children in Pakistan.  The bipartisan group led by Congressman



Joseph Kennedy II wrote "The Olympics represents the ultimate accomplishment

of a young athlete--it should NOT use a soccer ball which represents the

ultimate repression of children across the globe."</B>



<P><B>	Olympics used to be about sports, about world-class amateur athletes

from around the world competing for the honor of the sport.  I am tired of

seeing exploitation of the Olympics by Reebok and Nike and other commercial



interests.  And Nike isn't even an official sponsor of the Atlanta Games.

 It supplies shoes and outfits to many runners and other athletes.  Nike

built a Niketown in the middle of the Atlanta Games complex so that its



omnipresent "Swoosh" gives the appearance of being Olympic.</B>



<P><B>	Take a look at what countries are doing well at the games.  Costa

Rica, Taiwan and Malaysia, three large U.S. Olympic product suppliers, are

low on Olympic gold, silver and bronze, but have taken Olympic green away

from deserving U.S. suppliers of hats and shirts.  </B>



<P><B>	The best way to send a message to these Olympic charlatans is to just

say no.  Don't buy U.S. Olympic products that are imports.  Write your



congressman and tell him or her that there oughta be a law that requires

U.S. Olympic sponsors to make their souvenirs in the United States.  The

Atlanta Games were supposed to be America's Games.  We should support the

real home team, the American workers, who against all odds continue to make



top-quality products in the United States.</B>

<TITLE>McDonald's Unhappy Meals</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff" TEXT="#000040"><H1><B>The Sad Side of Happy Meals: Involuntary Imports</B>

</H1><P>

<P><B>I have a beef with McDonald's.  While their hamburgers are made with

All-American beef, their Happy Meals usually include a plastic toy that is

made in China.  Most Americans consider McDonald's to be as American as apple

pie, but as the company drifts farther from the vision of its Founding Father,

Roy Kroc, it becomes less and less patriotic.  One of these days the corporate

bean counters will start importing beef from Argentina and Roy Kroc will

turn over in his grave.</B>

<P><B>Sadly, Kroc's beliefs died with him at age 82 in 1984.   Roy Kroc believed

in America and in making his products "All-American."  He proudly required

that all McDonald's hamburgers contain only U.S. beef and that they be labeled

"Made in the USA."  </B>

<P><B>McDonald's obviously imports the Happy Meal's little plastic pieces

to make its arches more golden.     But McDonald's Kroc said "If you just

work for the money, you'll never make it, but if you love what you're doing

and you always put customers first, success will be yours."  Most McDonald's

customers don't want imported items surreptitiously slipped into their lunch

boxes.  By doing so, McDonald's is force feeding America involuntary

imports.</B>

<P><B>Surely, McDonald's customers would pay an extra nickel to get a true

All-American Happy Meal.  Though the Happy Meal is just an "All-American

Meal" (hamburger or cheeseburger, fries and a drink) with a ten cent imported

toy.  Let's just call it an "Un-American Meal."</B>

<P><B>Last month China became the number one country in terms of a trade

imbalance with the United States, surpassing Japan.  Remarkably, the United

States does not use its economic leverage against China to promote democracy

or oppose its abysmal human rights record.  In addition, China has a vast

network of more than 1,000 prison camps where political prisoners and other

inmates manufacture products for export.  These prison factories make plastic

toys, games, and hundreds of other products that wind up on the shelves of

Toys-R-Us and Wal-Mart, and could very well make it into your Happy Meal

container.</B>

<P><B>"Involuntary imports" are products that the purchasers believe are

made in the USA, thought they are actually manufactured overseas.   McDonald's

is not the only company to blame for these involuntary imports.  The small

toys found in Happy Meals, guaranteed to last 24 hours before breaking, are

commissioned by Disney, Tonka, the Flintstones, Barbie, Cabbage Patch and

Animaniacs.  While all of these toys were originally created in the United

States, none of them are made here now.</B>

<P><B>When Sears or Wal-Mart fails to make American products available on

their shelves, they also make us involuntary importers.  When you go into

J.C. Penney's or Macy's or Nordstrom to buy an American shirt, only to find

that none are available, and you are reluctantly forced to buy an import,

you make an involuntary purchasing decision.  When you buy a pair of Nike

shoes without realizing they were made overseas, you areinvoluntarily buying

an import.</B>

<P><B>There are many fine, inexpensive American products that would make

excellent Happy Meal companions.  For example, Crayola crayons with a coloring

book, a small Little Tikes toy and baseball cards are three examplesthat

are Made in the USA.  In fact, baseball cards would probably create more

repeat customers than many</B> <B>current Happy Meal trinkets, with youngsters

trying to get their favorite players.</B>

<P><B>So the next time you walk into a McDonald's, wake up and smell the

coffee.  Don't buy a Happy Meal.  Write to McDonald's at Kroc Drive, Oak

Brook, Illinois 60521 and tell them that you want your Happy Meals to be

made in the USA.  Or send McDonald's an e-mail at mcdfct@ibm.net.  Roy Kroc

would be proud of you.</B>

<P>

<TITLE>America Needs a Raise</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY LINK="#ff0000" VLINK="#408080" BACKGROUND="blue1.gif"><TABLE border=0 width="100%"><TR><TD width=150 valign=top align=left>

</TD><TD width=350 valign=top align=left><H1><B><A NAME=Raise>Give








America what it Needs: a</A></B>







<B><A NAME=Raise>Raise,

and Make the Economy More</A></B>







<B><A NAME=Raise>Competitive</A></B>









</H1><P ALIGN=Center>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>Neither the Democratic nor the Republican tax cut or minimum














wage proposals help make the U.S. economy more competitive.  Neither
plan helps small businesses.   I am proposing a tax reform plan that makes














American companies more competitive, reduces paperwork and helps those earning














less than $30,000 per year.  It does all of these without increasing the
budget deficit.  At the same time it also provides an increase in the minimum














wage without increasing unemployment.  It may sound impossible, or even














magical--I call it "trickle up economics."</B>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>My proposal is quite simple:  modify the social security
tax by creating an exemption and eliminating the ceiling.  Currently, social














security taxes (FICA and medicare) are the most regressive taxes we have.
 For someone earning $15,000 per year the social security tax bite is a whopping














$2,245, half paid by the employee and half by the employer.  I propose that
the first $15,000 of income be exempt from social security and medicare taxes,














for both workers and employers.   According to the Tax Foundation (a non-profit














think tank that studies taxation issues), this exemption will cost the U.S.














treasury $40 billion, while pumping $20 billion into the hands of those needing














it most, plus another $20 billion into their employer's pockets.   </B>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>Social security and medicare taxes currently are imposed
only on the first $60,600 of wages.  Those earning one million dollars per
year pay no more in social security taxes than a taxpayer earning $75,000














annually.  This tax ceiling is illogical and unfair.  These taxes are not
based on benefits, they are based on the ability to pay.  And a multimillionaire














can certainly afford to pay more than a working man earning $75,000 a year.














  </B>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>Even Steve Forbes' flat tax did not have a ceiling.  (My














proposal is a flat tax, and if Republicans like flat taxes they should endorse














ending the ceiling on social security taxes.) By eliminating the ceiling
on wages subject to social security taxes, the Tax Foundation estimates that
we will raise $64 billion in new revenues.  This no doubt could be called
Robin Hood tax reform: taking from the rich and giving to the poor.  The
$24 billion surplus can either be retained by the treasury to reduce the
federal deficit, or it can be spread around as a benefit to those earning
less than $30,000 per year.</B>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>This tax reform will also end the "nanny tax" problem for
those employing child-care workers at home:  if a nanny is paid less than
$15,000 per year (and most are) she (or he) will get more take-home pay and
her employer will save money and not be required to file quarterly and annual
tax forms.</B>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>	In the real world, where American factories compete with
those in Mexico and Korea, this reform will make the United States much more














competitive.  Take, for example, an assembly worker paid $7.50 to put electronic














products together.  He or she now makes $15,000 in gross salary, and nets
several thousand dollars less because of taxes, including a substantial social














security tax bite of $1,122.50, nearly $100 a month.  The employee will get
an immediate raise in take-home pay.  At the same time, the employer will
save an equal amount for each employee.   With 100 employees, a tidy $100,000














will be added to the employer's bottom line.  The employer will thus improve
its profitability and be more likely to keep its plant in the United States
open for business.</B>









<P ALIGN=Left><B>Who else will this reform benefit?  Students are often paid














under $7.50 per hour.  Restaurant workers, many in the textile industry and
in general those in semi-skilled occupations will benefit.  Those earning
more than $60,000 per year will pay more social security taxes, but even
the rich will benefit by saving taxes (and paperwork) for their nannies,
servants and chauffeurs. And if they own a business, the rich will benefit
from the new exemption.  This change will give America what it needs, a raise,
at no cost to the economy.</B>

<TITLE>Child Slavery</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY LINK="#ff0000" VLINK="#408080" BACKGROUND="blue1.gif"><TABLE border=0 width="100%"><TR><TD width=150 valign=top align=left>

</TD><TD width=350 valign=top align=left><H1><B><A NAME=child>We are Aiding

and Abetting Child Slavery</A></B>



</H1><P ALIGN=Left>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>Recently you bought your son or daughter a soccer ball.
There is a good chance that the ball was made by someone your child's age
or even younger. Fully half of the soccer balls sold in the United States
are made in Pakistan, and every one of those soccer balls had an assist from
a child under 14 who toils 10 hours a day in subhuman sweatshops, stitching
the ball or cutting material used to make it.</B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>This is not an isolated problem. More than 200 million children





worldwide, some as young as four and five years old, are slaves to the production





line. Most of these children work in Asia, especially the nations of India,





Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia, but Latin America is guilty of this human





rights abuse as well. India alone employs 50 million children under ages
10-14. These unfortunate children manufacture shoes, matches, clothing, rugs
and countless other products that are flooding the American market and driving





hard-working Americans out of jobs.</B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>More than 60 years ago the United States banned child labor,





sweatshops, long workdays and workweeks. But now we are subsidizing, encouraging





and failing to criticize the enslavement of young people in the Third World.
The so-called 'Third Wave,' boosted by President Clinton and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich in the form of GATT and the World Trade Organization, prohibits





member nations like the United States from discriminating against the importation





of goods made by children.</B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>Indian and Pakistani rug makers love child workers so much
that they buy them. That's right, children are bought and sold for cash or
in settlement of a debt. Iqbal Masih was sold into slavery when he was only
four years old. His Pakistani parents, desperate for money, sold their young
son for less than $16. For six years he was shackled to a carpet-weaving
loom most of the time, tying tiny knots for 10 hours every day. Carpetmakers
like the young weavers because their small fingers can make very tight knots,
and also because they are cheap to own and maintain. </B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>Masih was a free person by the age of 12 and crusaded against





the horrors of child labor. In November 1994 Iqbal spoke on the abysmal





conditions in the sweat shops of Pakistan at an international labor conference
in Stockholm, Sweden. The next month, he was given a Youth Action award in





Boston. Shockingly, in March 1995 he was gunned down in his village in Pakistan





while riding his bicycle. Eshan Khan, chairman of the Bonded Labor Front,
a group fighting child labor, said, "We know his death was a conspiracy by
the carpet mafia." While Pakistan has laws against child labor and slavery,
the government has taken very little action to combat it. Only a boycott
by the United States and other nations will have any impact on slave-based





industries like the rug manufacturers.</B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>Nike similarly bases its operations on finding the lowest-cost





labor to make its athletic shoes. Twelve-year-old girls work in Indonesian





sweatshops 70 hours a week making Nikes in unhealthy plants that reek of
glue. Blue jeans and cheap clothing made in Bangladesh wind up on the shelves
of American shops like K-Mart and Wal-Mart.</B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>The United States needs to take a leadership role in eradicating





child labor around the globe. If we are pounished for violating GATT for
doing so, let us confront it head on. Child labor is a human rights issue.
What is more of a human right than growing up a free person, attending school





without being shackeld to medieval machinery? </B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>Please remember every time you go shopping and see a label
that says made in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia or Indonesia,
that a 10-year-old prisoner of a feudal manufacturer probably contributed
his or her labor to that product. </B>



<P ALIGN=Left><B>Don't buy it. Tell the store why you won't buy clothing
and other products from these backward nations. Tell your Senator, Congressman





and presidential candidates that we should oppose the cruelest abuse of human





rights: child labor. And then buy the American-made alternative. It will
make you feel better about yourself and your fellow workers and send the
world and urgently needed message.</B>

We Hafta
Keep
Nafta?</B>

</A>










</H1><P ALIGN=Right>











<P><B>Do you remember during the NAFTA debates when President Clinton and
Vice President Gore said that if NAFTA was a failure we could get out of
it easily?  Well, by all accounts NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement,





















has been an abysmal failure.  At the same time, President Clinton also predicted





















that the "peso would become stronger if NAFTA passes."  In reality the Mexican





















peso has taken a bath and so has the American economy.</B>












<P><B>	Before NAFTA we had a modest trade surplus with Mexico.  NAFTA went
into effect in 1994.  During 1995 we ran a $20 billion deficit with our friends





















south of the border. This represents a loss of 460,000 American jobs.  North
of the border in Canada the problem is just as bad, another $20 billion deficit,





















another half million jobs down the tube.  While we might not have heard the
giant sucking sound that Ross Perot predicted, the silent draining of high-paying





















manufacturing  jobs is just as deadly to the American economy.   </B>












<P><B>	Even economists who predicted job gains from NAFTA are now predicting





















massive job losses. Gary Hufbauer, an economist with the International Economics





















Institute, whose predictions of job gains were embraced by the Clinton





















Administration, now has flip-flopped, predicting a net loss of 225,000





















jobs.</B>












<P><B>	The Clinton Administration boldly states that NAFTA created 340,000
"good" American jobs.  However, the government fails to broadcast the fact
that Mexican imports have cost us 800,000 good American jobs, a net loss
of nearly half a million.  By only counting job gains and not deducting job





















losses, the Administration is cooking the books:  it is like only counting





















deposits in your checking account and failing to deduct the checks written
on the account.   </B>












<P><B>	The United States Department of Labor has received 644 petitions for





















assistance from factories closed by NAFTA, one plant per day since January
1994.  Briggs and Stratton laid off 2,000 workers in Wisconsin and replaced
them with Mexican workers.  Fruit of the Loom replaced 3,200 employees. 
The not-so-Jolly Green Giant fired 1,200 Californians and replaced them with





















low-wage workers south of the border.   More than 100,000 Texas have lost
jobs due to NAFTA, driving home the fact that Ross Perot was right.</B>












<P><B>	A bipartisan group of 52 Congressmen, including 34 Democrats, introduced
a bill called the NAFTA Accountability Act, which would pave the way for





















withdrawal from NAFTA.  This bill provides for the renegotiation of the trade





















agreement if the trade deficit persists and other conditions have not been
met.  President Clinton has already backtracked on NAFTA by standing firm
against the use of Mexican trucks and drivers in California, Arizona, New
Mexico and Texas.   Among the other hidden problems with the trade agreement,
it provided that starting January 1, 1996 Mexican trucks and drivers could
enter the United States freely, even though their vehicles did not meet





















environmental, safety and health standards.  The drivers of these huge trucks
are not even required to be able to read American road signs.</B>












<P><B>	We were better off before NAFTA.  Do we ever learn from our mistakes?
 In addition to the staggering trade deficit with Mexico and Canada, NAFTA
opened our southern border to more drug trafficking.  One of the consequences
of the trade agreement at your local supermarket is a flood of tempting red
ripe tomatoes from Mexico.  Beware of these attractive produce--they are
Trojan tomatoes, tainted with the pesticide DDT.  While the United States





















prohibits the use of DDT, Mexico doesn't.   </B>












<P><B>	NAFTA undermines our living standards as well as our environmental,
safety and health laws.  The trade agreement exports good manufacturing jobs
and does very little positive for America.  Now is the time to dump NAFTA
and bring jobs back to the United States.  Let's get out before it is too





















late.</B>

Trade




Syndrome</B>

</A>











</H1><P>













<P> <B>Trading with China is a lot like eating Chinese food:  It is exciting
and appealing at first, but after indulging you are left hungry and unfulfilled,






















often with a pounding headache.  Yes, of course, China is a big market with
a billion potential consumers. But, getting down to the nitty-gritty, China
does not make anything that we really need.  Trading with China has injured






















America greatly, costing 700,000 well-paying jobs, harming hard-working






















Americans.  And to add insult to this painful injury, China has been kicking
us where it hurts most.  The more we trade with China, the more contempt
that it has for the United States and for human rights.	</B>













<P><B>	As China flexes its political muscles, threatening to invade Taiwan,






















ignoring human rights and selling weapons of mass destruction to Pakistan
and other countries, the United States must respond by tightening trade






















restrictions.  Last year China imprisoned Harry Wu, an American citizen who
had spent 19 years in Chinese labor camps.  It is from these very prison
labor camps that China has been exporting products.   Wu was granted admission
to China. After entering the country was arrested for espionage and faced
a possible death sentence.  The death penalty is a serious risk in China
where more than 1,000 "criminals" were executed last year. </B>













<P><B>	In its very essence "trade" means that we get something of value in






















exchange for our products. Trade is a two-way street.  But trade with China
has not been a two-way venture.  We sold China $11.7 billion worth of products
in 1995, but bought a whopping $45.6 billion worth, leaving us a massive
$34 billion deficit, second only to the trade deficit which we have with






















Japan.</B>













<P><B>	Back in the good old days of 1970 we did not trade with China at all.






















 Quian Qichen, the Chinese Foreign Minister, said recently, "For twenty-three






















years before Richard Nixon opened the door of relations between China and
the United States there was no trade.  I think you lived quite well.   And
so did we."  This is only half true.  We lived quite well 23 years ago, in
fact in many ways better than we do now, but the Chinese did not.  China's
per capita income has blossomed in the past two decades while ours has declined.






















  In 1973 the United States did not have a trade imbalance with the rest
of the world.  We were in fact on top of the world, with an improving standard
of living, low unemployment and a very low federal budget deficit.  </B>













<P><B>	We really don't get anything of lasting value from China.  We purchased






















two million military-style assault weapons from China in 1993.  These products






















have a negative value to American consumers.  I recently noticed that after






















playing at a video arcade my children were "awarded" whoopee cushions that
were manufactured in China.  Whoopee cushions, like assault rifles, have
a negative value.  We can live better lives without these useless products.</B>













<P><B>	Other Chinese products are no better.  Most, if not all, of the






















Chinese-made toys are virtually guaranteed to self-destruct within 48-hours
of purchase.  Just look at the broken toys around your house and you'll see
where they are made.  Then look at the ones that have lasted for years: 
Little Tikes, Lionel Trains, Tinker Toys, and you'll realize that the toys
with lasting value are made in the USA, or Europe.  Or take Chinese crayons.






















 Millions of Chinese crayons have been recalled because of lead contamination.






















 Chinese crayons are cheaper than American-made Crayola's, but at what






















cost?</B>













<P><B>	With workers paid fifty cents per hour or less it is not surprising
that the Chinese produce clothing cheaper than we do.  Not better, cheaper.
 Would you rather have one well-made American shirt, or two poorly made Chinese






















ones?   I would rather have one made in the USA employing well-paid American






















workers.</B>













<P><B>	Fully half of our shoes are made in China.  Reeboks, Nikes, all those






















highly advertised American-sounding brands made many of their shoes in China,






















paying workers twenty-five cents an hour.  But remarkably, these shoes do
not sell for less than those made in the USA.  </B>













<P><B>	Why do we grant Most Favored Nation (MFN) status to China and not
trade at all with Cuba?  President Clinton made the mistake of granting MFN
to China and "delinked" this status from their human rights record.  By doing






















this Clinton gave the Chinese the wrong signal, and China has used that sign
as a green light to clamp down on dissenters, arrest Harry Wu and sell nuclear






















materials to Pakistan.</B>













<P><B>	China does not deserve MFN status and we should revoke it immediately.






















 Yes, this may provoke a trade war with China.  So what?  Since trade with
China harms the United States, a trade war would do little harm here, but
would be devastating to China.  I understand that Boeing and a few other
major U.S. companies would be harmed by a trade battle with China, but what
about the  700,000 net jobs lost to Chinese imports?</B>













<P><B>	When human rights and democratic reforms are instituted in China,
we will see a dramatic increase in the wages paid to Chinese workers.  When






















workers in China are paid a reasonable wage, we will see our deficit with
that country dramatically reduced.  We must be prepared to fight by increasing






















tariffs and be prepared to battle the other symptoms of Chinese Trade Syndrome.






















 Otherwise, our children will not have jobs and we will buy most of our goods






















from dictatorial Third World nations, making the United States itself a






















third-class nation unable to help the developing democracies of the world.</B>

</TD><TD width=350 valign=top align=left><H1><B>Stop the Presses</B>!



</H1><P>



<P><B>Stop the Presses!  Stop the Presses!  The International Trade Commission



has ruled that Mitsubishi violated U.S. trade laws by selling eight massive



newspaper printing presses to the Washington Post at millions of dollars

below cost.  This process is known as dumping, and dumping is intended to

drive competitors out of business.  The target of Mitsubishi's dumping campaign,



Rockwell, is an American company based in Illinois, which manufactures



competitive printing equipment in the United States.  The Washington Post



acknowledges the high quality of the Rockwell presses, but still chose the



Mitsubishi equipment primarily because of its impossibly-low price.</B>



<P><B>It is important to note that the International Trade Commission is

no agency of protectionism.   In fact, the ITC often bends over backwards

to make sure the rights of foreign producers are protected and recently ruled



that Mexican tomatoes were not being dumped into the United States.    Thus,

when the ITC finds that a company dumped products in the United States, we

should take notice.</B>



<P><B>Now is the time to reconsider the decision to buy Mitsubishi printing



presses.  The International Trade Commission's unanimous decision that Mitsubishi



is dumping these presses demonstrates that the sale was neither fairly nor



legally negotiated.  If the Washington Post cares at all about America's

future, it should immediately cancel its contract with Mitsubishi to buy

$250 million worth of  printing equipment.   Since a contract in violation

of U.S. law is legally cancelable, the Washington Post should take the proper



action and not aid and abet companies that willfully violate U.S. laws.</B>



<P><B>Mitsubishi's tactics follow a precedent that Japanese companies set

in the 1970s when they dumped televisions in the United States, driving all



American television manufacturers out of business.  Zenith, the last



American-owned company to manufacture television in the United States, stood



alone against the Japanese onslaught, but was eventually driven out of the



market.  We have to stop these illegal practices before they destroy another



American industry.</B>



<P><B>For Japan international trade is war.  For the United States trade



negotiation is a game that its lawyers play- if they play nicely, they may

be hired to represent the Japanese after they retire from the government.

 Far too many U.S. trade negotiators have become traitors, negotiating on

behalf of foreign clients soon after leaving their U.S. government jobs.</B>



<P><B>Mitsubishi has a long history of corporate piracy and military



interventionism.   A recent example of Mitsubishi's corporate piracy involves



Fusion Systems, a small American high-tech company.  According to the Harvard



Business Review, Fusion invented a high-intensity ultraviolet lamp that is



powered by microwaves.  Fusion's microwave lamps are state-of-the art and

are used in the printing process and in the production of microchips.  Fusion



began selling its products in Japan in 1975.  Mitsubishi bought one in 1977

and had it delivered directly to its research and development lab where



Mitsubishi claimed it as its own in multiple patent filings in Japan.  This



process is called theft.</B>



<P><B>Mitsubishi has a favored place in the history of Japan's military



operations.  When the Japanese emperor launched a military conquest of Taiwan

in 1874, Mitsubishi was chosen to provide the ships. After Japan invaded

China in 1937, Mitsubishi was required to provide the military and occupation



forces with warships, aircraft, vehicles, weapons and provisions.  During

World War II Mitsubishi Heavy Industries manufactured 18,000 warplanes, including



the feared "Zero," which was often used in kamikaze or suicide attacks when

the pilot crashed his plane into American warships.</B>



<P><B>After World War II General Douglas MacArthur ordered that the Mitsubishi



keiretsu (cartel) be broken up.  Now, more than forty companies carry the



Mitsubishi name and three-diamond logo and are superficially separate.  The



Mitsubishi keiretsu, which includes Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (manufacturers

of the disputed printing presses) and Mitsubishi Motors, has been re-established



and is now the largest corporate empire in the world.</B>



<P><B>Like suicide missions of its Zero fighters in World War II, the Mitsubishi



printing press sale to the Washington Post is a kamikaze mission.  The



International Trade Commission found that Mitsubishi is selling the massive



presses far below cost.  The International Trade Commission ruled that a

punitive tariff of 63% must be paid on these presses, and under Mitsubishi's



contract with the Washington Post, Mitsubishi shoulders this burden. In its

quest to dominate the newspaper printing press business, Mitsubishi is prepared



to sacrifice hundreds of millions of dollars.  </B>



<P><B>	Do we want Mitsubishi, or any foreign company, to control the printing



presses for American newspapers?  Do we want the Washington Post or the New

York Times to be held hostage to Mitsubishi when the newspaper needs spare



parts?</B>



<P><B>The Washington Post created compelling history by standing up to President



Richard Nixon about Watergate and the Pentagon Papers.  The Post knows the



difference between right and wrong and is not afraid to take on powerful



opposition.   I, therefore, call upon the Washington Post to do the right

thing- cancel the Mitsubishi contract and buy the superior American-made

printing presses.  </B>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff" TEXT="#800040"><H1 ALIGN=Center><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT SIZE=+1>The Top American Shoes</FONT></FONT>



</H1><P>



<P>



<H2><A HREF="http://www.newbalance.com">New Balance Shoes</A>



</H2><P><B>New Balance Athletic Shoe began in 1906. Although the company



originally produced arch supports and orthopedic shoes, in the mid-1950s
New Balance began to work with runners to manufacture custom-made running
shoes. In 1976, New Balance introduced the M320 running shoe, which
was named the number one shoe on the market &nbsp;by Runners World magazine.

New Balance has been in the top ranks of the athletic shoe industry
ever since.</B>



<P><B>As recently as 1991, a German trade magazine ranked New Balance shoes
above Asics, Etonic, Karfu, Nike, Reebok, Converse, Lotto and Adidas- all



imports. Clearly, New Balance quality is recognized the world over.

In fact, in 1991 alone, New Balance exported over 1 million pairs of
its athletic shoes to Japan.</B>



<P><B>New Balance is especially noted for its superior product design. For



instance, it was the first company to offer width sizing in athletic shoes
and today remains the only major manufacturer to offer it.</B>



<P><B>New Balance manufactures a complete line of athletic shoes for men
and women, including running, court, cross court, basketball (men only),
hiking and walking shoes.</B>



<P><B>New Balance walking shoes are one of the company's newest product lines
and are expected to be the company's second-largest category after running
shoes. These walking shoes are made almost exclusively in the U.S.
and are a high-quality alternative to all-imported Rockports.</B>



<P><B>Although most New Balance shoes are made in the Boston area or Maine,
about 15 percent are imported, so check the labels on these shoes. They

sell between $45 and $60 and are available in shoe, sporting and department



stores and through the L. L. Bean catalogue.</B>



<H2>

</H2><P><HR>



<H2><A HREF="http://www.allenedmonds.com">Allen Edmonds Dress Shoes</A>



</H2><P><B>&nbsp;Allen-Edmonds Shoe Corporation of Port Washington, Wisconsin,



started making shoes in 1922, when Elbert Allen helped revolutionize the

shoe industry by manufacturing shoes without the traditional nails and stiff



steel shank. Over the years, the company changed both ownership and

focus many times. &nbsp;Today the company is owned by president John Stollenwerk



and 19 employees who saved the company from an out-of-state buyout and possible



offshore production in 1989. The company is also the proud manufacturer

of some of the finest handcrafted dress shoes in the world.</B>



<P><B>Allen-Edmonds shoes show up on some of the most famous feet that read

the globe- including former President George Bush's. These fine shoes

are exported to 33 countries and received the U.S. Commerce Deprtment's "E"

award for exporting. Allen-Edmonds even export to Japan- thanks in

part to Stollenwerk's brazen decision to crash a 1987 Tokyo footwear trade

show that had denied the company a trade booth.</B>



<P><B>Allen-Edmonds shoes are top quality, classic style dress shoes for

both men and women. The men's shoes are hand-made from the finest

lightweight, supple and breathable leathers and feature the largest array

of sizes in the world (size AAAA to EEE and 5 to 18). The shoes also

feature the flexibility of a shankless stitched welt design, the comfort

and breathability of all-leather soles, and a foot-conforming cork insole.

The materials and design combine to create an extremely comfortable

shoe. Because they are among the best of the best, these shoes carry

a fairly hefty price tag. The average cost of a pair of Allen-Edmunds'

men's shoes is $230, but can go as high as $1,500.</B>



<P><B>Originally a manufacturer of men's shoes only, Allen-Edmonds began

offering women's dress shoes in 1989. These include classic style,

low-heel dress shoes and boots made from the best calfskin, suedes, chamois

and exotic leathers available. There are 25 different models, including

slip-on, buckle and tie dress shoes as well as more casual yet fashionable

boots and demiboots.</B>



<P><B>Although much of its shoe leather is imported, Allen-Edmonds manufactures



every single pair of its shoes in Port Washington and Lake Church, Wisconsin,



with the help of 400 employees. Allen-Edmonds shoes can be found at

quality department and shoe stores nationwide.</B>

  <A NAME=hath>Can Hathaway Shirtmakers be Saved?</A>
</H1>
<P>
<B>One hundred and fifty-nine years ago C. F. Hathaway opened a shirt factory
in Waterville, Maine. It is the oldest shirt factory in the United States.
While it may be old on the outside, it is state-of-the art efficiency on
the inside.</B>
<P>
<B>In 1960 apparel conglomerate Warnaco bought Hathaway. Now, 49 year-old
Linda Wachner, CEO of the Warnaco, announced that Hathaway will be closed
down. It sounds like the same old story that we have heard time and time
again of ineffecient American plants being put out of business by foreign
competition.</B>
<P>
<B>But Hathaway is very efficient and has been getting more so. In January
of 1995 it cost Hathaway $124.53 to produce a dozen shirts, or a little more
than $10 each. Not bad for shirts that retail for $50 or more. However, Cornell
University Professor Peter Lazes worked with the plant to make it even more
efficient. And, as of March, 1996, the cost to make a dozen shirts fell to
$62.89, or $5.24 each. At the same time, with a slightly reduced work force,
the plant produced 36,612 shirts per week, up from 21,828 per week, and
astounding 68% increase in productivity.</B>
<P>
<B>Wachner visited the plant in January, 1995 and promised workers that she
would not close the plant if quality work continued and the cost of a shirt
came down. From our point of view, and from a legal perspective as well,
Wachner and Warnaco breached its agreement with the 500 workers at the Waterville
plant. They cut costs considerably and are now told that they are being cut
loose by the company.</B>
<P>
<B>Warnaco has refused to give details of the profitability of the plant.
It claims that Hathaway loses money, which it may, because Warnaco has not
advertised the Hathaway brand for six years. Remember those old eye-patch
commercials with celebrities wearing their Hathaway dress shirts?</B>
<P>
<B>At the same time that she is effectively firing 500 mostly female workers,
Mrs. Wachner is earning $10 million a year, unbelievably more than the entire
workforce at the Hathaway factory. The average employee in Waterville makes
about $15,000 per year.</B>
<P>
<B>Made in the USA Foundation is working to help the employees at Hathaway
buy the plant. It is working with union, financial, politicians and other
leaders to find the right combination to make Hathaway a viable company
again.</B>
<P>
<B>If Hathaway shirts were available at retail outlets, consumers would buy
them. Warnaco wounded Hathaway, but lets hope that it lets the plant continue
in business.</B>

  <B>Why Buy American Products?</B>
</H3>
<P>
<B>Many of you are familiar with Made in the USA advertising and the importance
of buying goods produced by American workers. Not only does the Made in the
USA label ensure that jobs are kept in the United States, but it also has
proven an effective marketing strategy for businesses. </B>
<P>
<B>Buying American benefits both workers and corporations, instilling a pride
in U.S. citizens about our economy and our manufacturing processes. We at
the Made in the USA Foundation hope to raise public awareness about quality
American goods and the obstacles that our companies face competing in a global
economy.</B>
<P>
<H3>
</H3>
<H3>
  <B>What is the Made in the USA Foundation?</B>
</H3>
<P>
<B>The Made in the USA Foundation (MUSA) was formed in 1989 by a coalition
of individuals, trade unions and corporations who were concerned about American
competitiveness and economic leadership. MUSA is now a 60,000 member independent
and non-partisan organization which has been approved by the Internal Revenue
Service as a non-profit foundation. Donations to MUSA are tax-deductible.</B>
<P>
<B>The basic premise of the Foundation is that strong and effective action
must be taken to reduce American reliance on imports, to increase purchases
of U.S. products domestically and overseas and to ensure that the standards
of fair trade are applied evenly around the world.</B>
<H3>
</H3>
<H3>
  <B>What Does the Foundation Stand For?</B>
</H3>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <B>Consumers have a right to know where products are manufactured. This
    information should appear on product labels and in product advertising.</B>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <B>American environmental and worker safety laws should not be undermined
    by imports which do not meet these standards.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Reciprocity is the benchmark for all bilateral trade. We should not allow
    foreign countries to do in this country what our companies are prohibited
    from doing in theirs.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Foreign companies that dump products in the United States below manufacturing
    costs should be dealt with firmly.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Foreign government subsidies of manufactured and agricultural products
    should be aggressively opposed.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Foreign products produced by child labor, slave or prison labor should
    be banned from the United States.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Foreign barriers to American products should be attacked aggressively.</B>
</UL>
<P>
<B>The Foundation supports promoting American-made products in the USA and
abroad through advertising and public relations efforts.</B>

  <A NAME=home>The Homeless: Another Casualty in the Trade Wars</A>
</H1>
<P>
<B>The homeless are everywhere and nowhere. In a nation that prides itself
on keeping statistics about every conceivable economic activity, it is remarkable
that there is no reliable data on the extent of homelessness. </B>
<P>
<B>Everyone agrees that homelessness started a dramatic increase in the 1970s
and 1980s. Republican Jack Kemp, former chairman of the Interagency Council
on the Homeless said, "Today's homelessness started to become a highly visible
and recognized problem in many cities in the late 1970s and early 1980s."
In the 1950s and 1960s seeing a homeless person was indeed a rarity. Now
it seems you trip over them even in the best of neighborhoods. </B>
<P>
<B>Who are the homeless? Three-quarters of the homeless are single men. Nearly
half of them are veterans. Most of these vets were once productive blue-collar
workers who were laid off either by "downsizing" or because of the relocation
of plants overseas. </B>
<P>
<B>Homelessness is next to joblessness and both are caused by our massive
trade deficits. In the early 1970s we did not have a trade deficit&Aring;our
exports and imports were nearly equal. We also did not have a massive
homelessness problem. And then the floodgates opened. Until 1973 we did not
trade with China at all. We had a small trade deficit with Japan then as
the first waves of Toyotas, Hondas and Datsuns were invading our shores in
small battalions. </B>
<P>
<B>The vast rise in our trade deficit is mirrored by an alarming rise in
the homeless population. Now families are joining shelters where only males
used to flee. It used to be that an American with a high school degree could
get a decent job with a predictable future and buy a decent home. Now,
alarmingly, home ownership is declining for the first time in American history.
Many of us are only one paycheck away from poverty and from losing our homes
or apartments. Ten thousand Americans are losing their homes to foreclosure
every month and many times that number are thrown out onto the streets by
court-ordered evictions. </B>
<P>
<B>Homelessness is one of the hidden costs of the trade wars. When American
consumers buy cheap Chinese shoes, Malaysian clothing and Taiwanese electronics
we are also buying unemployment and homelessness in America. Besides losing
jobs and homes, we lose tax revenues and drain our unemployment funds. Why
do you think that we have had federal budget deficits for the last two decades?
Because we are losing our tax base. Incomes have not increased in twenty
years, they have actually declined. We are the only major nation to suffer
this fate, so I do not blame international trade alone. I blame the American
government and the trade negotiators for getting us bad trade agreements
and by failing to enforce our own trade and tariff laws. </B>
<P>
<B>For example, federal law provides that imported trucks are subject to
a 25% duty. Cars are subject to a duty of only 2.5%. The Japan lobby has
succeeded in having Toyota, Mazda, Nissan and Izusu trucks and minivans
classified as cars for duty purposes, but as trucks for safety and other
purposes. The British-made Range Rover pulled the Shetland wool over somebody's
eyes when it convinced the feds that its $60,000 off-road vehicles were trucks
in order to escape the luxury tax, but were cars to escape the truck duty.
It should be the other way around- Rovers are certainly luxury vehicles and
should be taxed as such, and they are trucks for duty purposes. Each Rover
should bring the federal government $10,000 or more in revenues but brings
in only about $1,000. When Range Rovers cost a mere $40,000, Murphy Brown
said it made more sense to buy a Ford Explorer and strap $20,000 in cash
to the hood- you would get the same effect. </B>
<P>
<B>By circumventing import duties these imported trucks not only cost American
jobs they cost the U.S. treasury $1.2 billion dollars annually. I estimate
that we could build 30,000 homes for the homeless (at $40,000 each) with
these revenues. This in turn would create tens of thousands of jobs for plumbers,
carpenters, masons and others. </B>
<P>
<B>Foreign corporations have found countless ways for dodging American taxes.
Japanese and European corporations set up importing subsidiaries in this
country: Toyota of America, Mercedes Benz of North America and so forth.
Most of these foreign corporations pay little or no income tax in the United
States. They do this slight-of-hand trick by claiming that they make no income
here by overcharging their own subsidiaries. Their accountants miraculously
transfer profits back to Tokyo or Munich or London. The Internal Revenue
Service has tried unsuccessfully to go after these companies because many
Japanese parent corporations refuse to turn over documents to the U.S.
government. President Clinton promised to close this gaping loophole, but
has not done so thus far. This loophole costs American taxpayers tens of
billions of dollars every year, strengthens our trade opponents and makes
balancing the U.S. budget that much harder. </B>
<P>
<B>We should deny most favored nation status to China- it doesn't deserve
it and trading with China costs several hundred thousand jobs. The symptoms
of our trade deficits are everywhere to be found. Next time you see a homeless
person, let him inspire you to write your congressman or the president and
strengthen your desire to buy only American products. Most homeless people
are casualties of our trade wars and should be constant reminders that we
are in a battle for economic survival.</B>
<P>
<B>Without changing our laws, just by enforcing existing laws, we can turn
the trade war around. </B>

  <B><A NAME=child>We Are Aiding and Abetting Child Slavery</A></B>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Recently you bought your son or daughter a new soccer ball. There is a
good chance that the ball was made by someone your child's age or even younger.
Fully half of the soccer balls sold in the United States are made in Pakistan
(some sold as Nike products), and every one of those soccer balls had an
assist from a child under 14 who toils 10 hours a day in subhuman sweatshops,
stitching the ball or cutting material used to make it.</B>
<P>
<B>This is not an isolated problem. More than 200 million children worldwide,
some as young as four and five years old, are slaves to the production line.
Most of these children work in Asia, especially the nations of India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh and Indonesia, but Latin America is guilty of this human rights
abuse as well. India alone employs 50 million children between the ages of
10 and 14. </B>
<P>
<B>These unfortunate children manufacture shoes, matches, clothing, rugs
and countless other products that are flooding the American market and driving
hard-working Americans out of jobs.</B>
<P>
<B>More than 60 years ago the United States banned child labor, sweatshops,
long workdays and workweeks. But now we are subsidizing, encouraging and
failing to criticize the enslavement of young people in the Third World.
The so-called 'Third Wave", boosted by President Clinton and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich in the form of GATT and the World Trade Organization prohibits
member nations like the United States from discriminating against the importation
of goods made by children.</B>
<P>
<B>Indian and Pakistani rug makers love child workers so much that they buy
them. That's right, children are bought and sold for cash or for the settlement
of a debt. Iqbal Masih was sold into slavery when he was only four years
old. His Pakistani parents, desperate for money, sold their young son for
less than $16. For six years he was shackled to a carpet-weaving loom most
of the time, tying tiny knots 10 hours a day. Carpetmakers like the young
weavers because their tiny fingers can make very tight knots, and also because
they are cheap to own and maintain. Masih was a free person by the age of
12 and crusaded against the horrors of child labor. In November 1994 Iqbal
spoke on the abysmal conditions in the sweat shops of Pakistan at the
international labor conference in Stockholm, Sweden. The next month, he was
given a Youth Action award in Boston. Shockingly, in March 1995 he was gunned
down in his village in Pakistan while riding his bicycle. Eshan Khan, chairman
of the Bonded Labor Front, a group fighting child labor, said, "We know his
death was a conspiracy by the carpet mafia." </B>
<P>
<B>While Pakistan has laws against child labor and slavery, the government
has taken very little action to combat it. Only a boycott by the United States
and other nations will have any impact on slave-based industries like the
rug manufacturers.</B>
<P>
<B>Nike similarly bases its operations on finding the lowest-cost labor to
make its athletic shoes. Twelve-year-old girls work in Indonesian sweatshops
70 hours a week making Nikes in unhealthy plants that reek of glue. Blue
jeans and cheap clothing made in Bangladesh wind up on the shelves of American
shops like K-Mart and Wal-Mart. The United States needs to take a leadership
role in eradicating child labor around the globe. If we are punished for
violating GATT for doing so, let us confront it head on. </B>
<P>
<B>Child labor is a human rights issue. What is more of a human right than
growing up a free person, attending school without being shackled to medieval
machinery?Please remember every time you go shopping and see a label that
says made in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia or Indonesia, that
a 10-year-old prisoner of a feudal manufacturer probably contributed his
or her labor to that product. Don't buy it. Tell the store why you won't
buy clothing and other products from these backward nations. Tell your Senator,
Congressman and presidential candidates that we should oppose the cruelest
abuse of human rights: child labor. And then buy the American-made alternative.
</B>
<P>
<B>The Made in the USA Foundation is sponsoring a new effort to combat child
labor around the globe called CAUSE, Children Against Underage Servitude
and Employment. CAUSE is run by children in America. CAUSE will provide materials
for students and teachers explaining how children are exploited around the
world and deprived of a real childhood. You can write to CAUSE care of Made
in the USA Foundation, 1925 K Street, N.W. Suite 100, Washington, DC 20006.
Its a good cause and one that children can get excited about. Perhaps it
will take American children to make Congress take action against child slavery
around the world. </B><IMG SRC=bluebds.gif>

<H1>
  <B><A NAME=raise>Let's Give America A Raise</A></B>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Neither the Democrat nor the Republican tax cut or minimum wage proposals
help make the U.S. economy more competitive. Neither plan helps small businesses.
I am proposing a tax reform plan that makes American companies more competitive,
reduces paperwork and helps those earning less than $30,000 per year. It
does all of these without increasing the budget deficit. At the same time
it also provides an increase in the minimum wage without increasing unemployment.
It may sound impossible, or even magical- I call it "trickle up economics."</B>
<P>
<B>My proposal is quite simple: modify the social security tax by creating
an exemption and eliminating the ceiling. Currently, social security taxes
(FICA and medicare) are the most regressive taxes we have. For someone earning
$15,000 per year the social security tax bite is a whopping $2,245, half
paid by the employee and half by the employer. I propose that the first $15,000
of income be exempt from social security and medicare taxes, for both workers
and employers. According to the Tax Foundation (a non-profit think tank that
studies taxation issues), this exemption will cost the U.S. treasury $40
billion, while pumping $20 billion into the hands of those needing it most,
plus another $20 billion into their employer's pockets. </B>
<P>
<B>Social security and medicare taxes currently are imposed only on the first
$60,600 of wages. Those earning one million dollars per year pay no more
in social security taxes than a taxpayer earning $75,000 annually. This tax
ceiling is illogical and unfair. These taxes are not based on benefits, they
are based on the ability to pay. And a multimillionaire can certainly afford
to pay more than a working man earning $75,000 a year. </B>
<P>
<B>Even Steve Forbes' flat tax did not have a ceiling. (My proposal is a
flat tax, and if Republicans like flat taxes they should endorse ending the
ceiling on social security taxes.) By eliminating the ceiling on wages subject
to social security taxes, the Tax Foundation estimates that we will raise
$64 billion in new revenues. This no doubt could be called Robin Hood tax
reform: taking from the rich and giving to the poor. The $24 billion surplus
can either be retained by the treasury to reduce the federal deficit, or
it can be spread around as a benefit to those earning less than $30,000 per
year.</B>
<P>
<B>This tax reform will also end the "nanny tax" problem for those employing
child-care workers at home: if a nanny is paid less than $15,000 per year
(and most are) she (or he) will get more take-home pay and her employer will
save money and not be required to file quarterly and annual tax forms.</B>
<P>
<B>In the real world, where American factories compete with those in Mexico
and Korea, this reform will make the United States much more competitive.
Take, for example, an assembly worker paid $7.50 to put electronic products
together. He or she now makes $15,000 in gross salary, and nets several thousand
dollars less because of taxes, including a substantial social security tax
bite of $1,122.50, nearly $100 a month. The employee will get an immediate
raise in take-home pay. At the same time, the employer will save an equal
amount for each employee. With 100 employees, a tidy $100,000 will be added
to the employer's bottom line. The employer will thus improve its profitability
and be more likely to keep its plant in the United States open for
business.</B>
<P>
<B>Who else will this reform benefit? Students are often paid under $7.50
per hour. Restaurant workers, many in the textile industry and in general
those in semi-skilled occupations will benefit. Those earning more than $60,000
per year will pay more social security taxes, but even the rich will benefit
by saving taxes (and paperwork) for their nannies, servants and chauffeurs.
And if they own a business, the rich will benefit from the new exemption.
This change will give America what it needs, a raise, at no cost to the
economy.</B>

  <A NAME=labels>Testimony on Country of Origin Labels</A>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Joel D. Joseph, Chairman of the Foundation was the first witness called
by the International Trade Commission on April 10 concerning the country
of origin labeling of products. Excerpts of his testimony:</B>
<P>
<B>There are many deceptive practices being used by companies trying to appear
to be U.S. manufacturers. The U.S. Lock Company, for example, does not make
locks in the United States. FloridaGold orange juice may come from Brazil:
The label states that the product conducts orange juice from Florida and/or
Brazil. But what is it? Florida juice or Brazilian juice? American consumers,
and consumers from around the world, have the right to know. </B>
<P>
<B>We don't want Florida orange juice to come from any other place. We want
Idaho potatoes from Idaho, Long Island duckling from Long Island and Vermont
maple syrup from Vermont. Maple Grove Farms of Vermont sells maple syrup
that may be from Vermont or may be from Canada. The label is clearly
deceptive.</B>
<P>
<B>There is a case pending before the courts in the United States about Swiss
Army knives that are made in China. I don't believe that the Swiss Army has
ever left that country, and most certainly never made it to China. The Made
in the USA Foundation supports the Swiss manufacturer in its claim that Swiss
Army knives can only be made in Switzerland. </B>
<P>
<B>Similarly, Americans and others would assume that Milwaukee tools are
made in Milwaukee, that Virginia hams come from Virginia and that Rockport
shoes come from Rockport. Milwaukee tools are indeed made in Wisconsin and
Virginia pigs are the source of Virginia hams, but Rockport shoes are made
elsewhere. Similarly L.A. Gear shoes are not made in Los Angeles, although
most consumers would believe that L.A. Gear products are made in Southern
California. American cities, states and regions deserve the same respect
as those in Europe- if a manufacturer wants to use an American geographical
name it must manufacture the product here. </B>

  <B><A NAME=bumper>New Bumper Stickers</A></B>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Made in the USA Foundation has produced four new bumper stickers pictured
on this page and on the back cover. The actual size of the stickers is 3
x 11 inches. All of the stickers are white and blue and were made at a union
plant. We are selling the stickers for $1.00 each, a dozen for $10, 100 for
$75 and 1,000 for $500. Call us with your order at 800/USA-PRIDE or use the
order form on this page. The stickers can be used by companies or local unions
as a part of a "Buy American" campaign. Most Americans do not realize that
Nike uses child laborers to make its athletic shoes in Indonesia and to produce
soccer balls under its logo in Pakistan. These children are "paid" from six
to fourteen cents per hour. Some of these unfortunate children were sold
into slavery by their parents for $15 to $20. Do your part to oppose child
labor. </B>
<P>
<B>There is no charge for shipping and handling.</B>

<H3><B>Why Buy American Products?</B>









</H3><P><B>Many of you are familiar with Made in the USA advertising and
the importance of buying goods produced by American workers. Not only does
the Made in the USA label ensure that jobs are kept in the United States,
but it also has proven an effective marketing strategy for businesses. </B>









<P><B>Buying American benefits both workers and corporations, instilling
a pride in U.S. citizens about our economy and our manufacturing processes.
We at the Made in the USA Foundation hope to raise public awareness about
quality American goods and the obstacles that our companies face competing
in a global economy.</B>









<P>





<H3>

</H3><H3><B>What is the Made in the USA Foundation?</B>









</H3><P><B>The Made in the USA Foundation (MUSA) was formed in 1989 by a

















coalition of individuals, trade unions and corporations who were concerned
about American competitiveness and economic leadership.  MUSA is now a 60,000

















member independent and non-partisan organization which has been approved
by the Internal Revenue Service as a non-profit foundation. Donations to
MUSA are tax-deductible.</B>









<P><B>The basic premise of the Foundation is that strong and effective action

















must be taken to reduce American reliance on imports, to increase purchases
of U.S. products domestically and overseas and to ensure that the standards
of fair trade are applied evenly around the world.</B>









<H3>

</H3><H3><B>What Does the Foundation Stand For?</B>









</H3><P>





<UL><LI><B>Consumers have a right to know where products are manufactured.










This information should appear on product labels and in product

















advertising.</B>









</UL><UL><LI><B>American environmental and worker safety laws should not
be undermined by imports which do not meet these standards.</B>









<LI><B>Reciprocity is the benchmark for all bilateral trade. We should not
allow foreign countries to do in this country what our companies are prohibited

















from doing in theirs.</B>









<LI><B>Foreign companies that dump products in the United States below

















manufacturing costs should be dealt with firmly.</B>









<LI><B>Foreign government subsidies of manufactured and agricultural products

















should be aggressively opposed.</B>









<LI><B>Foreign products produced by child labor, slave or prison labor should
be banned from the United States.</B>









<LI><B>Foreign barriers to American products should be attacked

















aggressively.</B>









</UL><P><B>The Foundation supports promoting American-made products in the
USA and abroad through advertising and public relations efforts.</B>

<H1><B>FTC Accused of Violating Buy American Act</B><A NAME=ftc>
</A>








</H1><P><B>How can we expect U.S. businesses and consumers to buy American
when our own government decides to purchase foreign-made goods? This unsettling

















news was revealed one day prior to the Federal Trade Commission's workshop
on, of all things, the labeling of products as "Made in America."</B>









<P><B>On March 25, the Made in the USA Foundation filed a complaint against
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for violating the Buy American Act. The

















complaint was filed with the Comptroller General of the United States who
has jurisdiction over the Buy American Act.</B>









<P><B>The FTC has conducted an ongoing inquiry into the advertising of products

















which claim to be "Made in the USA," in hopes of preventing false claims.
While its efforts to protect companies which use American labor should be

















commended, the FTC may need to reappraise its own purchasing practices.</B>









<P><B>Before its March 26-27 workshop on "Made in the USA" labeling, the

















Commission distributed a CD-ROM of public comments to all participants. Yet
this disk, which addresses "Made in the USA" issues, was actually produced
in Japan by the Verbatim Corporation.</B>









<P><B>Joel Joseph, Chairman of the Made in the USA Foundation said, "This
shows that the Federal Trade Commission is not really concerned with buying

















American products. It is typical of the inside-the-beltway mentality that
is insensitive to the buy American movement."</B>









<P><B>"The FTC is flouting the Buy American Act at the very moment that it
is criticizing companies for their 'Made in the USA' advertising claims.</B>









<P><B>The Made in the USA Foundation contends that the Commission blatantly

















violated the Buy American Act, which mandates that all Federal Agencies must

















purchase goods and supplies made in the United States where reasonably available

















and of satisfactory quality.</B>









<P><B>American-made compact disks certainly could have been acquired at

















competitive prices, and American CDs are of comparable or superior quality
to their Japanese counterparts.</B>









<P><B>Ironically, the FTC has filed a complaint against New Balance Athletic
Shoe for advertising its products as "Made in the USA," because the shoes
contain only 71% American content. </B>









<P><B>"At least New Balance is trying its best to make products in the USA,"
said Joseph. "The Federal Trade Commission is part of the problem with our

















economy, oblivious to the benefits of buying American, and equally oblivious
to the requirements of federal law."</B>

<H1><B>Free Trade Bill of Rights<A NAME=free>
</A>


</B>





</H1><P><B>(The Foundation has been accused of being protectionist. Over
the last sixty years the United States has built a framework of worker protection

















laws, from minimum wages and maximum hours to occupational safety and health.
We want to protect these measures, and if by doing so we are protectionists,
then we wear that badge proudly. But we are not opposed to real free trade.
This article explains what we mean by free trade. We will have the Free Trade

















Bill of Rights introduced in Congress as one of our legislative

















initiatives.)</B>









<P><B>Free trade never existed. Free trade is a myth that fuels political
debate and drains the U.S. economy. In order for there to be real free (and
fair) trade in the world, all nations must agree to certain ground rules.</B>









<P><B>Here is the Free Trade Bill of Rights, which should serve as a standard
for other nations seeking to trade with the United States. As the world's
leading manufacturer, and the only superpower, we should flex our muscles,
using access to the largest consumer market as leverage for making the playing

















field level.</B>









<P><B><U>Article One.</U> <I>Democracy</I>. The right of the people to vote
in elections for their representative government shall not be infringed.
[Workers in totalitarian nations, like China, are not free workers.]</B>









<P><B><U>Article Two.</U> <I>Freedom of Speech and Assembly</I>. The right
of the people to speak freely and to assemble shall not be infringed. This

















article includes the right to advertise products for sale and to compare
products in these advertisements. [Many countries, including Germany, prohibit

















certain comparative ads.]</B>









<P><B><U>Article Three.</U> <I>Prohibition of Child Labor.</I> Children under
the age of fifteen shall have the right to an education and be free from
coerced labor. [There are two hundred million children under the age of 15

















"employed" around the world, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil
and many other nations. Many of these children are sold into slavery and
chained to machines.]</B>









<P><B><U>Article Four</U>. <I>Prohibition of Slave Labor.</I> No person shall
be forced to work or sold into slavery. Prison labor shall be permitted,
however, the export of goods made by prison laborers shall be prohibited.
[China uses prison labor for exports, including political prisoners]</B>









<P><B><U>Article Five.</U> <I>Trade Unions Protected</I>. Free and unfettered

















trade unions shall be protected to the fullest extent of the law. All persons

















shall be allowed to join the trade union of their choice and shall not be

















retaliated against for joining a union or for soliciting others to join or
to form a trade union.</B>









<P><B><U>Article Six</U>. <I>Environmental Protection.</I> Emissions from

















factories and agricultural chemicals shall be controlled to the maximum extent

















possible.</B>









<P><B>Environmental laws of the United States shall be the international

















standard, but any nation shall be free to establish stricter standards.

















[Pesticides, such as DDT which is banned in the United States, are now imported

















on Mexican tomatoes.]</B>









<P><B><U>Article Seven</U>. <I>Worker Safety and Health.</I> The safety and

















health of workers shall be protected to the maximum extent possible. The

















occupational safety and health laws of the United States shall be the

















international standard, but any nation shall be free to establish stricter

















standards.</B>









<P><B><U>Article Eight</U>. <I>Minimum Wages and Maximum Hours.</I> Factory
and agricultural workers shall be entitled to reasonable wages, in no event
less than one-fourth of the hourly minimum wage in the United States. [This
means that manufacturing wages will rise in the Third World to $1 per hour
or more, giving these workers the ability to buy American products. Now workers

















in Nike plants in Indonesia, for example, are paid 14 cents per hour and
cannot afford to buy the shoes that they produce.]</B>









<P><B>No worker shall be compelled to work more than forty-eight hours per
week. [The United States adopted the 40-hour work week decades ago, while
Germany and France have even shorter work weeks.] </B>









<P><B><U>Article Nine</U>. <I>Barriers to Trade. </I>No nation shall discriminate

















against imports from the United States nor impose other barriers to trade.
[Most nations impose more trade barriers than the United States. Many nations

















have more favorable trade rules for other nations than for the United States

















causing tariffs and duties that discriminate against American goods.]</B>









<P><B><U>Article Ten.</U> <I>Illicit Trade Prohibited</I>. Nations shall
not trade illicit drugs, poisonous chemicals or materials capable of being
used in nuclear weapons or in chemical or biological weapons. [When an outlaw

















nation provides others with deadly materials, the United States and other
nations have every right to ban trade with that country. Currently, China
has been caught by the CIA with selling nuclear equipment to Pakistan. This

















provision would allow the United States to punish China with trade

















sanctions.]</B>









<P><B>When someone asks you about Free Trade, be prepared with tough questions

















about slave labor, child labor and human rights. Free trade only works if

















everyone plays by the same rules.</B>

<H1><B>All-American Basketball Company Formed<A NAME=aab>
</A></B>








</H1><P><B>Although basketball was invented in the United States over 100
years ago, NO basketballs are now made in the United States. The Foundation
is helping a new company, the All-American Basketball Company to get started
by providing it with an office in Washington, D.C.</B>









<P><B>The company is now looking for a site for its factory which will make

















basketballs from scratch using as much American content as possible. The

















All-American Basketball Company is now raising $3.3 million of which it needs
$2 million for equipment. The company plans to raise most of its capital
from NBA coaches, players and owners. </B>









<P><B>In addition to basketballs, the company will produce T-shirts, sweat
pants and other basketball accessories. Rod Willis, president of the company,

















said that he wants to create meaningful jobs that use all types of skills
and talents, from creative design to engineering. Willis said, "For every
boy who dreams of making the NBA there are 1,000 who never make it. We created

















the All-American Basketball Company for all of those who love basketball
and want a career in basketball, but didn't make the dream team. This is
our dream team."</B>

<H2><H1><B>Chairman's Corner</B><A NAME=chair>
</A>








</H1></H2><P><B>Trading with China is a lot like eating Chinese food: It
is exciting
and appealing at first, but after indulging you are left hungry and unfulfilled,

















often with a pounding headache. </B>









<P><B>Yes, of course, China is a big market with a billion potential consumers.

















But, getting down to the nitty-gritty, China does not make anything that
we really need. Trading with China has injured America greatly, costing 700,000

















well-paying jobs, harming hard-working Americans. And to add insult to this

















painful injury, China has been kicking us where it hurts most. </B>









<P><B>The more we trade with China, the more contempt that it has for the
United States and for human rights.</B>









<P><B>As China flexes its political muscles, threatening to invade Taiwan,

















ignoring human rights and selling weapons of mass destruction to Pakistan
and other countries, the United States must respond by tightening trade

















restrictions. </B>









<P><B>Last year China imprisoned Harry Wu, an American citizen who had spent
19 years in Chinese labor camps. It is from these very prison labor camps
that China has been exporting products. Wu was granted admission to China.
After entering the country was arrested for espionage and faced a possible
death sentence. The death penalty is a serious risk in China where more than

















1,000 "criminals" were executed last year. </B>









<P><B>In its very essence "trade" means that we get something of value in

















exchange for our products. Trade is a two-way street. But trade with China
has not been a two-way venture. We sold China $11.7 billion worth of products
in 1995, but bought a whopping $45.6 billion worth, leaving us a massive
$34 billion deficit, second only to the trade deficit which we have with
Japan. </B>









<P><B>Back in the good old days of 1970 we did not trade with China at all.
Quian Qichen, the Chinese Foreign Minister, said recently, "For twenty-three

















years before Richard Nixon opened the door of relations between China and
the United States there was no trade. I think you lived quite well. And so
did we." This is only half true. We lived quite well 23 years ago, in fact
in many ways better than we do now, but the Chinese did not. </B>









<P><B>China's per capita income has blossomed in the past two decades while
ours has declined. In 1973 the United States did not have a trade imbalance
with the rest of the world. We were in fact on top of the world, with an

















improving standard of living, low unemployment and a very low federal budget

















deficit. </B>









<P><B>We really don't get anything of lasting value from China. We purchased
two million military-style assault weapons from China in 1993. These products

















have a negative value to American consumers. I recently noticed that after

















playing at a video arcade my children were "awarded" whoopee cushions that
were manufactured in China. Whoopee cushions, like assault rifles, have a

















negative value. We can live better lives without these useless products.
</B>









<P><B>Other Chinese products are no better. Most, if not all, of the Chinese-made

















toys are virtually guaranteed to self-destruct within 48-hours of purchase.
Just look at the broken toys around your house and you'll see where they
are made. Then look at the ones that have lasted for years: Little Tikes,
Lionel Trains, Tinker Toys, and you'll realize that the toys with lasting
value are made in the USA, or Europe.</B>









<P><B>Or take Chinese crayons. Millions of Chinese crayons have been recalled

















because of lead contamination. Chinese crayons are cheaper than American-made

















Crayola's, but at what cost? </B>









<P><B>With workers paid fifty cents per hour or less it is not surprising
that the Chinese produce clothing cheaper than we do. Not better, cheaper.
Would you rather have one well-made American shirt, or two poorly made Chinese

















ones? I would rather have one made in the USA employing well-paid American

















workers. </B>









<P><B>Fully half of our shoes are made in China. Reeboks, Nikes, all those
highly advertised American-sounding brands made many of their shoes in China,

















paying workers twenty-five cents an hour. But remarkably, these shoes do
not sell for less than those made in the USA. </B>









<P><B>Why do we grant Most Favored Nation (MFN) status to China and not trade
at all with Cuba? President Clinton made the mistake of granting MFN to China
and "delinked" this status from their human rights record. By doing this
Clinton gave the Chinese the wrong signal, and China has used that sign as
a green light to clamp down on dissenters, arrest Harry Wu and sell nuclear

















materials to Pakistan. </B>









<P><B>China does not deserve MFN status and we should revoke it immediately.
Yes, this may provoke a trade war with China. So what? </B>









<P><B>Since trade with China harms the United States, a trade war would do
little harm here, but would be devastating to China. I understand that Boeing
and a few other major U.S. companies would be harmed by a trade battle with

















China, but what about the 700,000 net jobs lost to Chinese imports? </B>









<P><B>When human rights and democratic reforms are instituted in China, we
will see a dramatic increase in the wages paid to Chinese workers. When workers

















in China are paid a reasonable wage, we will see our deficit with that country

















dramatically reduced.</B>









<P><B>We must be prepared to fight by increasing tariffs and be prepared
to battle the other symptoms of Chinese Trade Syndrome. Otherwise, our children

















will not have jobs and we will buy most of our goods from dictatorial Third
World nations, making the United States itself a third-class nation unable
to help the developing democracies of the world.</B>

<H1><B>A Kinder, Gentler NAFTA</B><A NAME=nafta>
</A>








</H1><P><B>Do you remember during the NAFTA debates when President Clinton
and Vice President Gore said that if NAFTA was a failure we could get out
of it easily? Well, by all accounts NAFTA, the North American Free Trade

















Agreement, has been an abysmal failure. At the same time, President Clinton
also predicted that the "peso would become stronger if NAFTA passes." In
reality the Mexican peso has taken a bath and so has the American economy.
</B>









<P><B>Before NAFTA we had a modest trade surplus with Mexico. NAFTA went
into effect in 1994. During 1995 we ran a $20 billion deficit with our friends

















south of the border. This represents a loss of 460,000 American jobs. North
of the border in Canada the problem is just as bad, another $20 billion deficit,

















another half million jobs down the tube. While we might not have heard the
giant sucking sound that Ross Perot predicted, the silent draining of high-paying

















manufacturing jobs is just as deadly to the American economy. </B>









<P><B>Even economists who predicted job gains from NAFTA are now predicting

















massive job losses. Gary Hufbauer, an economist with the International Economics

















Institute, whose predictions of job gains were embraced by the Clinton

















Administration, now has flip-flopped, predicting a net loss of 225,000

















jobs.</B>









<P><B>The Clinton Administration boldly states that NAFTA created 340,000

















"good"American jobs. However, the government fails to broadcast the fact
that Mexican imports have cost us 800,000 good American jobs, a net loss
of nearly half a million. By only counting job gains and not deducting job

















losses, the Administration is cooking the books: it is like only counting

















deposits in your checking account and failing to deduct the checks written
on the account. </B>









<P><B>The United States Department of Labor has received 644 petitions for

















assistance from factories closed by NAFTA, one plant per day since January
1994. Briggs and Stratton laid off 2,000 workers in Wisconsin and replaced
them with Mexican workers. Fruit of the Loom replaced 3,200 employees. The

















not-so-Jolly Green Giant fired 1,200 Californians and replaced them with
low-wage workers south of the border. More than 100,000 Texas have lost jobs
due to NAFTA, driving home the fact that Ross Perot was right. </B>









<P><B>A bipartisan group of 52 Congressmen, including 34 Democrats, introduced
a bill called the NAFTA Accountability Act, which would pave the way for

















withdrawal from NAFTA. This bill provides for the renegotiation of the trade

















agreement if the trade deficit persists and other conditions have not been
met. President Clinton has already backtracked on NAFTA by standing firm
against the use of Mexican trucks and drivers in California, Arizona, New
Mexico and Texas. Among the other hidden problems with the trade agreement,
it provided that starting January 1, 1996 Mexican trucks and drivers could
enter the United States freely, even though their vehicles did not meet

















environmental, safety and health standards. The drivers of these huge trucks
are not even required to be able to read American road signs. </B>









<P><B>We were better off before NAFTA. Do we ever learn from our mistakes?
In addition to the staggering trade deficit with Mexico and Canada, NAFTA
opened our southern border to more drug trafficking. One of the consequences
of the trade agreement at your local supermarket is a flood of tempting red
ripe tomatoes from Mexico. Beware of these attractive produce- they are Trojan

















tomatoes, tainted with the pesticide DDT. While the United States prohibits
the use of DDT, Mexico doesn't. </B>









<P><B>NAFTA undermines our living standards as well as our environmental,
safety and health laws. The trade agreement exports good manufacturing jobs
and does very little positive for America. Now is the time to revise NAFTA
and bring jobs back to the United States. </B>









<P><B>Made in the USA is now working on legislation to amend NAFTA. We will

















propose that Mexican minimum wages be tied to American wages so that over
a ten year period our minimum wages would be equal. We also want Mexican

















agricultural products to be free of the pesticide DDT, so our legislation
will remedy this problem. Made in the USA wants Mexican living standards
to improve for two reasons: Mexico is a neighbor and if we want our neighbors
to buy our products they must be paid decent wages.</B>

</TD><TD width=350 valign=top align=left><H1><A NAME=brown><B>Loyalty










and




Greed:</B>

</A>








<BR><B>The
Browns,
the Rustbelt
and <BR>the Future of America</B>












</H1><P ALIGN=Center>











<P><B>The Cleveland Browns, not the Dallas Cowboys, are truly America's team.





















 Cleveland symbolizes the heartland of America, its industrial center.  Native





















Clevelanders, including this author, have created the Browns Diaspora, fleeing





















their home town in search of greener, and often warmer, pastures.  I have





















relocated in Maryland, but I want the Browns to stay where they belong--in





















Cleveland.</B>












<P><B>	Cleveland is home of the most loyal sports fans in the nation.  Despite
a mediocre team over the last decade the Cleveland Browns have played nearly





















every home game on the shores of bone-chilling Lake Erie before 75,000 screaming





















fans.  Art Modell's decision to move the Browns is an affront, not only to





















Cleveland, but to the United States.  He epitomizes the lack of loyalty of





















American business owners who pick up their factories and move them to





















Mexico.</B>












<P><B>	Cleveland fans, like Cleveland and other rust-belt workers, are the





















foundation on which teams and nations are built.  Professional baseball is
now learning the hard way that without fans the game is dead, and the owner's





















wallets are lighter as a result.  Similarly, if every company picks up its





















factory and moves it to a third-world country, the entire economy will fall





















apart--few will have money to buy anything.  It is not only loyalty--it makes





















common sense to cater to your home market, employ your neighbors and develop
a sense of community.  If we have no loyalty to community, loyalty to our
country will be next to disappear.  </B>












<P><B>	The process of having cities and states bid against each other to





















subsidize sports teams, or manufacturing companies, is destined for failure.





















 Someone has to pay for all of these subsidies.  And that someone is the
American taxpayer and the American worker.</B>












<P><B>	Maryland taxpayers will pay for the $200 million dollar subsidy to
the "Baltimore Browns."  What happens in ten or fifteen years when Maryland's





















stadium become obsolete and Tucson or Pensacola or London is willing to pay
a subsidy to lure the Baltimore Browns?  Baltimore suffered this fate once
before when the Colts fled in the middle of the night for the illusive glamour
of Indianapolis.  The Colts should have stayed in Baltimore and the Browns
should stay in Cleveland.</B>












<P><B>	Mercedes-Benz decided a few years ago that it could make its vehicles
more efficiently in the United States.  Dozens of states were tripping over
each other to curry favor with Mercedes.  Alabama won the bidding war, luring
the luxury German automaker with a pledge of $253 million in tax breaks and





















incentives. </B>












<P><B>	The United States would have attracted a Mercedes plant without any





















subsidy.  We must stop this counterproductive struggle pitting one community





















against another.  Congress, under its power to regulate interstate and foreign





















commerce, can stop the bidding madness for manufacturing plants.  These subsidies





















are in essence corporate welfare that harms rather than helps the national





















economy.  It is the proper role for the federal government to referee this





















wasteful competition among the various states.</B>












<P><B>	The National Football League and the City of Cleveland have the power
to stop the insanity that allows a successful sports franchise to pick up
and move.  Current NFL rules allow it to just say "No" to Art Modell.  By
doing so the football league would be acting for its own long-term preservation,





















because ultimately the fans will rebel and fail to show up for losing teams.
 The new loyalties will only go so far--so far as their newly adopted home
team is winning.  True loyalty, as Cleveland fans have demonstrated, takes





















generations to nurture.</B>












<P><B>	The City of Cleveland, under its power of eminent domain, can seize
the Browns and pay Modell fair compensation.  This is the American way. 





















America's Team deserves to stay where it was born, where it has thrived,
where it has lost and where the fans support it.  I say to Cleveland--Seize
the Day and Seize the Browns.  Do it for yourselves and do it for America
and America's real team. </B>

<P> <B>Made in the USA Foundation has produced four new bumper stickers pictured




below. The actual size of the stickers is 3 x 11 inches. All of the stickers

are white and blue and were made at a union plant. We are selling the stickers




for $1.00 each, a dozen for $10, 100 for $75 and 1,000 for $500. Call us

with your order at 800/USA-PRIDE. The stickers can be used by companies or

local unions as a part of a "Buy American" campaign. Most Americans do not




realize that Nike uses child laborers to make its athletic shoes in Indonesia

and to produce soccer balls under its logo in Pakistan. These children are

"paid" from six to fourteen cents per hour. Some of these unfortunate children




were sold into slavery by their parents for $15 to $20. Do your part to oppose




child labor. </B>

  Lawsuit Filed Against the Library of Congress <BR>
  for Violation of the Buy America Act
</H1>
<P>
<P>
<B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:<BR>
Thursday, December 19, 1996 </B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>Joel Joseph or Denis Gaynor at
202/822-6060</B>
<P>
<P>
<B>WASHINGTON - In the midst of their Christmas rush, many holiday shoppers
pause to make sure that the garment, appliance or toy they want to purchase
has been made in the U.S.A. Unfortunately, the Library of Congress has not
shown the same sort of concern about where its own products are manufactured
- despite being required to do so under federal law. This flagrant disregard
for the Buy America Act has led the Made in the USA Foundation, American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Council 26,
and two local AFSCME unions to file a lawsuit today against the Library of
Congress.</B>
<P>
<B>In 1990, the Library of Congress initiated the American Memory Project,
a pilot project to digitize important works maintained by the Library. Since
that time, the American Memory Project has become a part of the new National
Digital Library. But the Library of Congress chose to ignore the Buy America
Act by entering into contracts for the American Memory Project which called
for work to be performed in Jamaica and the Philippines. The Buy America
Act mandates that government agencies use American goods and services whenever
possible.</B>
<P>
<B>Joel Joseph, chairman of the Made in the USA Foundation, stated: "The
Information Superhighway has been sold to the American public as a great
engine of job creation. But to be successful, the information highway must
not be a freeway encouraging job transfers to the lowest cost workers overseas.
If the Library of Congress has to go to the Philippines to create the National
Digital Library of the United States, then the Internet is doomed to be a
one-way road to the unemployment lines for millions of Americans." </B>
<P>
<B> Automated Sciences Group and Systems Integration Group, Inc. were contracted
to produce a CD-ROM containing two collections for the American Memory Project
as well as a digital product of various texts for the National Digital Library.
Today's lawsuit charges that both contractors falsely submitted documents
to the government for payment under contract, by intentionally and willfully
violating that contract. The suit also claims that the two companies made
misleading assertions that they would comply with the Buy America Act.</B>
<P>
<B>Congressman James Traficant (D-OH), a strong supporter of the Buy America
Act, said that the Library of Congress should have worked harder to use American
workers for the project. Traficant also said that the existing contracts
should be inspected carefully by Congress.</B>
<P>
<B>"Having spent the better part of my Congressional career fighting to ensure
that federal agencies comply with both the letter and the spirit of the Buy
America Act, I find this latest incident quite disturbing," he said. "The
manner in which this contract was awarded should be closely scrutinized by
Congress and the Library's own procurement personnel. If procurement rules
and Federal laws regarding Buy American were violated, then the contract
should be null and void."</B>
<P>
<B>"More importantly," Congressman Traficant continued, "the Library of Congress
should've made a better effort to reach out to American firms and ensure
that all of the work on this contract would be done in this country."</B>
<P>
<B>The suit filed by the Made in the USA Foundation and AFSCME places blame
not only on the contractors, but also on the Library of Congress. Made in
the USA and AFSCME charge that the Librarian of Congress either knew or should
have known that the work was performed outside the United States and that
the U.S. content of the final product was minimal.</B>
<P>
<B>Joel Stern, president of Local 2477 of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, explained why the Library's actions should
serve as warning to workers throughout the U.S. "Seeking bargain basement
wage rates overseas is bad for everyone. It depresses wages here at home
and exploits sub-human wage rates abroad. The saving s realized by the
subcontractor in this situation didn't save American tax-payers any money;
it just boosted his own profit margin. It's wrong for the Library of Congress
to be associated with this kind of profiteering. Everyone comes out ahead
when people get a real living wage for the work they do."</B>
<P>
<B>The Made in the USA Foundation is a non-profit organization with 60,000
members nationwide. The Foundation is dedicated to promoting American products
and seeks the enforcement of laws meant to improve U.S. balance of payments,
like the Buy America Act. The two AFSCME locals that are joining the Made
in the USA Foundation in filing the lawsuit are AFSCME Local 2477 and Local
2910, which both represent Library of Congress Employees. AFSCME Council
26 represents employees in a number of federal agencies, including the Library
of Congress. </B>

News Release ER 96-025<br>

<br>



            <center><h2>DEFICIT WITH CHINA SETS NEW RECORD IN 1995</strong></center></h2>





The United States registered a $33.8 billion deficit in merchandise trade with China during

1995, up from $29.4 billion during 1994, according to the United States International Trade

Commission (ITC) in its report <em>Trade Between the United States and China, the Successor

States to the Former Soviet Union, and Other Title IV Countries During 1995.</em><p>



The ITC, an independent, nonpartisan, factfinding federal agency, prepares quarterly reports

on U.S. trade with the countries that come under the authority of Title IV of the Trade Act

of 1974.  (Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 includes provisions that deny or place

conditions on the granting of most-favored-nation tariff status.)  Report highlights follow.<p>



    Total U.S. merchandise exports to the countries covered by the report increased to

     $15.7 billion during 1995 from $13.1 billion during 1994 and $12.8 billion during

     1993.  Total merchandise imports from these countries rose to $50.7 billion during

     1995 from $42.8 billion during 1994 and $33.7 billion during 1993.  China continued

     to dominate U.S. trade with these partners.<p>



    U.S. exports to China rose to $11.6 billion during 1995 from $9.2 billion during

     1994. During 1995, fertilizers, airplanes, and cotton were the leading items exported

     to China.<p>



    U.S. imports from China increased to $45.4 billion during 1995 from $38.6 billion

     during 1994.  Imports of machinery, mechanical appliances, and electrical equipment

     jumped to $11.4 billion from $8.7 billion.  Major increases also were registered in

     shipments of miscellaneous manufactured articles and footwear.  However, in textiles

     and textile articles, consisting mainly of apparel items, imports fell from $6.1 billion

     to $5.8 billion over the period.  Footwear and toys were the leading imports during

     1995.<p>



    During 1995, Russia was the largest U.S. trading partner among the former Soviet

     republics, followed by Ukraine and Kazakhstan.  The U.S. trade deficit of

     $706.6 million with Russia during 1994 increased to $1.27 billion during 1995.  In

     trade with Ukraine, the U.S. deficit of $150.4 million in 1994 increased to

     $187.1 million in 1995.  In trade with Kazakhstan, a U.S. trade surplus of

     $71.6 million during 1994 changed to a deficit of $46.9 million during 1995.<p>



    U.S. trade with Vietnam more than doubled from 1994 to 1995, showing the

     continuing effects of the end of the U.S. embargo on trade with Vietnam on

     February 3, 1994.  In 1995, Vietnam ranked fourth in U.S. exports to the monitored

     countries, after China, Russia, and Romania, with U.S. exports of $249.6 million.<p>





The report also presents a section identifying the most rapidly growing imports from China

and the extent of their penetration into the U.S. market.  <p>



Copies of <em>Trade Between the United States and China, the Successor States to the Former

Soviet Union, and Other Title IV Countries During 1995</em> (USITC Publication 2965, May

1996) will be available on the ITC's Internet server at <em>http://www.usitc.gov</em> and

<em>ftp://ftp.usitc.gov</em>.  The report is expected to be available on a future edition of the

Department of Commerce's National Trade Data Bank.  A printed copy may be obtained by

calling 202-205-1809 or by writing to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade

Commission, 500 E Street SW, Washington, DC 20436.  Requests also may be faxed to 202-205-2104.<p>

</HEAD><BODY><H2><B>Stuffed Shirt:  A Supreme Court Justice and his Misplaced Loyalties</B>
</H2><P>
<P><B>by Joel D. Joseph</B>
<P>
<P><B>(Chairman, Made in the USA Foundation.  The Made in the USA Foundation
is  a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting American products in
the United States and overseas with 60,000 members. The Foundation is located
at 1925 K Street, N.W., Suite 100, Washington, DC 20006, 800/USA-PRIDE, e-mail
MadeUSAFdn@aol.com.)</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>While Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer proudly included on his
resume that he dug ditches when he was a teenager, the Boston-based jurist
could be more fairly characterized as a stuffed shirt.</B> <B>Justice Stephen
Breyer, appointed to the United States Supreme Court in 1994 by President
Bill Clinton,</B> <B>certainly loves his shirts.  As the wealthiest justice,
worth a hefty $8.5 million, Justice Breyer can afford to</B> <B>buy nearly
anything he wants.  </B>
<P>
<P><B><I>The Washington Post </I>reported that Breyer spent $2,100 on 16
custom-made</B> <B>shirts from Ascot Chang, a Hong Kong shop that sends fitters
to you.  This is a staggering $131.25 each.</B> <B>Justice Breyer's pricey
shirts say two things about him:  he spends wildly, and more importantly,
despite his ditch-digging past, he doesn't give a damn about American blue-collar
workers.   </B>
<P>
<P><B>Justice Breyer lived in New England before his appointment to the nation's
highest court.  In nearby Waterville, Maine, the Hathaway</B> <B>Company
has been making excellent dress shirts for 159 years,  making it the oldest
shirt factory in the</B> <B>United States.  Threatened with extinction by
its owner, Hathaway could have used Justice Breyer's</B> <B>business.  (New
York-based conglomerate Warnaco, announced earlier this year that it was
closing Hathaway, but efforts are underway to keep the factory in business
under different ownership.)  Hathaway shirts sell for a mere $30 and up,
certainly within Justice Breyer's budget.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Apparently, the multimillionaire justice wanted his shirts custom-fit.
 The Custom Shirt Shop would have come to his chambers at the Supreme Court
to fit Breyer personally, carefully measuring him 13 different ways.  The
Custom Shirt Shop makes its shirts in Franklin, New Jersey, where its union
workers are paid far more than shirtmakers in Hong Kong.  Yet these American
custom-made shirts can be had for a mere $60 a pop, which would have saved
Stephen Breyer a cool $1,000.00.  The Custom Shirt Shop has several stores
in Washington, D.C. and some 70 throughout the country.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Stephen Breyer really knows how to spend a dollar, whether an American
dollar or a Hong Kong dollar.  He</B> <B>was severely criticized for approving
construction of the gold-plated $218 million courthouse in Boston. This "Taj
Mahal" on the Boston waterfront includes a $1.5 million pier and 33 kitchenettes
for the exclusive</B> <B>use of the federal judges who work in the
building.</B>
<P>
<P><B>But this article in not mainly about a free-spending Supreme Court
justice.  It is about a disloyal one.  One</B> <B>who cares more about his
shirts than his country.  One that doesn't care about the plight of American
workers</B> <B>who suffer an unemployment rate twice that found in Hong Kong.
and live on a take-home pay that hasn't</B> <B>increased in two decades.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Justice Breyer's loyalties may have been distorted by his foreign
investments and other foreign ties.  Breyer</B> <B>invested heavily in Lloyds
of London (a really bad investment) and owns real estate in London and on
the</B> <B>Caribbean isle of St. Kitts.  His wife is the daughter of a British
conservative leader.  Possibly, hobnobbing</B> <B>with the elite in Boston
and London blurred Breyer's allegiances and sensibilities.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This lack of loyalty is surprising for an Eagle Scout.  An Eagle Scout
is the highest achievement for a boy</B> <B>scout, achieved by a mere few
percent of scouts.  Most Eagle Scout's are highly loyal Americans,
including</B> <B>among their members many generals and politicians.   For
example, H. Ross Perot and Senator Sam Nunn</B> <B>were both Eagle Scouts.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>All boy scouts take an oath of loyalty which reads: "A Scout is true
to his family, Scout leaders, friends,</B> <B>school, and nation."  Additionally,
the Scout's oath pledges the scout to "do the best to do my duty to . . .
my</B> <B>country."</B>
<P>
<P><B>I call upon Justice Breyer to unstuff his shirts, follow the scout
oath and the scout slogan to "do a good turn</B> <B>daily":  Next time you
buy shirts, or anything else, buy American.</B>

	Nike has invaded the NFL with Alien Gear</B>
      </H1>
      <P>
      <P>
      <B>Welcome to the National Football League, the pride of Taiwan, Bangladesh
      and China. You thought football was American? Although the official NFL football
      is made by Wilson in the US of A, the league has authorized Nike, Reebok
      and others to produce official NFL gear in Third World countries which allow
      child labor, slave labor and sweatshop conditions.</B>
      <P>
      <B>There's nothing better than cool autumn Sundays spent watching professional
      football at the stadium or in the comfort of your own living room. Everyone
      has their favorite team. Maybe you grew up outside of Philadelphia and are
      a diehard Eagles fan. Or maybe you had a favorite player like Unitas, or
      Starr, or Bradshaw who seemed to carry their entire team on their back, and
      so their team became your team. And maybe you have that old jersey your father
      gave you, the jersey that made you proud to be associated with that player
      or team, and with football in general. But things have changed.</B>
      <P>
      <B>Now when you go to give your son or daughter a T-shirt or hat bearing
      their favorite team's logo--look at the label. Where you might expect to
      find the words "Made in the USA," you now see "Made in China" or "Made in
      Bangladesh." Professional football has become this country's most popular
      sport, and many athletes make more money in a season than most Americans
      could hope to spend in a lifetime. Players and owners like Deion Sanders
      and Art Modell tell us that football has become a business, and what matters
      is the bottom line. Not all owners and players agree. Frank Gifford, former
      Giants star and husband of Kathy Lee, agrees that NFL teams should require
      that products licensed to use NFL logos be made in the USA. </B>
      <P>
      <B>We at the Made in the USA Foundation believe in a different conception
      of football. We see football as America's sport which brings families and
      friends together, encouraging friendly rivalries and spirited good times.
      Many of football's most loyal fans are hard-working individuals our country's
      manufacturing sector. Yet as more and more manufacturing is shipped overseas,
      these men and women rightfully fear losing their jobs. We call on the NFL's
      owners to re-evaluate their priorities, and bring the production of their
      "official" products back to the United States.</B>
      <P>
      <B>A large majority of NFL fans want to buy U.S.-made products. But by importing
      NFL-logo products, the National Football League and its teams are turning
      off the fans, the lifeblood of the sport. These fans now are refusing to
      buy imported souvenirs and have become irritated by the lack of choice. I
      believe that it is in the owners' long-term interests to keep fans supportive
      and enthusiastic.</B>
      <P>
      <B>For every player who makes it to the NFL there are literally thousands
      who don't make the grade. Unfortunately, many of these athletes are unemployed
      or are employed in low-wage jobs. In this tough job market we need to keep
      Americans working at productive jobs. The backbone of our economy has always
      been manufacturing. Making NFL-logo products in the USA will not by itself
      turn the economy around, but it is an important symbolic step to creating
      jobs in the United States.</B>
      <P>
      <B>Did you know that NFL coaches and players can be fined for wearing American
      hats on the sidelines? The football league strongly enforces its game day
      rules for authorized clothing. While the league's henchman are tough on rule
      violators, incredibly its rules favor importers of souvenir hats and
      jerseys.</B>
      <P>
      <B>The National Football League, as well as many collegiate teams, sell their
      souls to the highest bidders. Nike, Starter and Reebok, all three hollow
      companies, pay millions of dollars for the rights to use the logos of the
      Dallas Cowboys and many other NFL franchises. By hollow companies I mean
      companies that don't own a single factory. They are not manufacturers at
      all, they are marketing companies.</B>
      <P>
      <B>College souvenirs are also being made in sweatshops overseas. I saw a
      University of Maryland jersey at J.C. Penney's selling for over $60.00 that
      was made in Bangladesh. Irate, I called University officials who placed the
      blame on the Collegiate Licensing Company.</B>
      <P>
      <B>The Collegiate Licensing Company represents 145 major universities in
      the United States, from Yale and Georgetown to Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan,
      University of North Carolina and the Air Force Academy. For from $50 to $1,000
      anyone can be authorized to make T-shirts, sweatshirts, hats or jerseys with
      the logos of these well-known universities. Collegiate Licensing, and the
      colleges themselves, could require that team logo products be made in the
      USA.</B>
      <P>
      <B>Next time you see your favorite sports team's name on a T-shirt or hat,
      look at the label. If it is not made in the USA--don't buy it. Send the NFL
      and your favorite team a message: you will support it when it supports creating
      jobs in the USA.</B>

  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> If you are interested in purchasing an American-made, finely crafted
  bicycle, Cannondale Corp. of Georgetown, CT, is your source. Unlike many
  of its competitors, Cannondale makes every single one of its bicycles distributed
  in the U.S. in its plants in Bedford and Phillipsburg, PA. Cannondale currently
  exports to over 60 countries. Cannondale began just 20 years ago, when president
  and founder Joe Montgomery and four staffers began hand-building bicycle
  trailers above a pickle factory. A year later, the small group began to
  hand-build bicycles. This year Cannondale celebrates its 25th year in business.
  Although Cannondale has grown significantly since its humble beginnings,
  Joe Montgomery's commitment to quality, innovation and a hand-built bicycle
  carries over to this day. </B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> Cannondale bicycles feature patented, wide-girth, all-aluminum frames
  that make these bikes lighter, more efficient and more shock absorbing that
  a traditional steel frame bicycle. Cannondale was the first company to mass
  produce such a frame. Each Cannondale frame is computer designed and hand-built.
  It takes four hours and 40 pairs of human hands to manufacture a single
  Cannondale frame. Furthermore, every Cannondale frame features a lifetime
  guarantee.</B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> This year, Cannondale has introduced the Super V Active full-suspension
  mountain bike and the Slice monocoque carbon fiber road bike.</B>

  <B> Trek USA designs, engineers and manufactures high quality, technologically
  sophisticated bicycles in the United States. With global markets and a full
  line of high performance components and accessories, Trek is a leader in
  the sale of bicycles over $300 U.S. retail. Trek also manufactures the popular
  Gray Fisher line, and last year acquired the Gary Klein and Bontrager brands.
  Trek also manufactures a premium line of road bikes and accessories designed
  by three-time Tour de France winner Greg Le Mond. </B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> Founded in a small barn in Waterloo, WI, in 1976, Trek Bicycle Corporation
  is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intrepid Corporation, a privately held company
  located in Waukesha, WI. Begun with just five employees making hand-built
  bicycle frames, Trek USA has grown into a globally-oriented corporation.
  The majority of those employed by Trek work in its three Wisconsin manufacturing
  facilities. </B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> Trek concentrates on developing state of the art bicycles, and in fact
  the Y bike, a full suspension mountain bike with a carbon fiber composite
  frame, was designed with technology that was pioneered in the development
  of the Stealth fighter. In 1995, Popular Mechanics magazine awarded the designers
  of the Y bike its Design Engineer of the Year Award. </B>

  its plant in Ooltewah, TN, and in fact all of Litespeed's mountain bikes,
  including the Ococee, Tellico and Hiwassee, are named after local Tennessee
  rivers. The company's commitment to value is reflected in the Hiwassee, which
  sports a full 3-2.5 Ti frame, front suspension, complete parts, and brilliant
  durable powdercoat finish- yet retails for under $1600, a price unheard just
  one year ago.</B>

  <B> In 1971, Boston bike mechanic created his original version of the now-famous
  U-lock. Though it weighed a hefty 5 pounds, the lock's new design proved
  very effective. In fact, the Kryptonite U-Lock was installed in the permanent
  design collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and received the
  "Good Design" award in Japan. Kryptonite stands behind many of its products
  with an anti-theft guarantee offer of up to $1000.</B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B>And though the company had to withdraw this guarantee from covering Manhattan,
  NYC, the world's stolen bike capital, the company recently came out with
  its virtually indestructible New York lock, guaranteed throughout the U.S.
  and Canada. Kryptonite's highest security U-locks are produced in Canton,
  MA.</B>

  <B>Merlin Metalworks was founded in 1986 with the goal of building a new
  generation of bicycles that would combine high strength, unexcelled durability,
  light weight, and ride comfort in one frame. To achieve this goal, they selected
  an exceptionally strong titanium alloy originally developed for the U.S.
  aerospace industry and available only in the U.S.A. The result was the original
  Merlin mountain bike, the world's first aerospace titanium bicycle. The success
  of this design brought exponential growth, and today in addition to satisfying
  the requests of U.S. cycling enthusiasts, Merlin frames are exported to 38
  countries around the world. Fully half of the country's yearly production
  is sold overseas. In addition, the company maintains a full-time sales office
  in Leysin, Switzerland, to coordinate international sales, though every frame
  is still handcrafted in one factory in Cambridge, MA. Prices start at $1525,
  with top-of-the-line models retailing for $3000. Complete bicycles range
  from $2300 to $5500. </B>

  Cage bottle cages, and Specialized bottles. But the company takes particular
  pride in its helmets, which are hand-assembled and hand-taped in Morgan Hill.
  Specialized helmet designers are constantly developing and testing new retention
  systems, and creating innovations such as the Brainlock and Headlock, which
  in 1995 won Bicycle magazine's award for "Best Retention System for Off-Road
  Helmets." </B>

  CO has designed a new rear bicycle rack meant for convenience, safety and
  versatility. The Load Llama Ultimate Bike Rack features expandable, rotating
  arms that form a sturdy frame basket or stable flat platform to accommodate
  objects of any shape. Designer Ted Simonett came up with the idea for the
  Load Llama in 1988 while hiking and biking in New Zealand. Frustrated by
  the dilemma of whether to carry his gear in a back pack for hiking convenience
  or in panniers for cycling ease, he improvised with aluminum shelving strips
  and a bungee cord to create a stable way to carry a large pack on his rear
  rack. </B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> Nett Designs markets this rack to students and exercise-conscious,
  energy-aware commuters who ride their bikes to work or while doing errands.
  Load Llama is assembled in Colorado at an employment and training center
  for people with disabilities. </B>

  hub and dropout standards for the new generation of triple clamp suspension
  forks, Ringle continues to innovate. New products on the horizon include

<B>As summer draws to a muggy close, Labor Day will soon be here. Every year
on this holiday, families from all across the country come together to celebrate
the working men and women who continually make us proud to be a part of this
great nation. We at the Made in the USA Foundation salute these Americans,
who take pride in their work and in the goods that they produce.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<B>Below you'll find a descriptions of some of the finest products made in
the United States. Some you'll find useful for family picnics or when the
children return to school. Others include stories of companies founded on
an American Dream, which says that with perserverance, anything is possible.
Yet, all the products listed below share one thing in common: they are made
by the hands of dedicated American men and women. </B>

<P>
<P>
<B>Richard James was a marine engineer aboard ship in 1943 when a coiled,
circular torsion spring fell off a table and began rolling around the deck.
Its wild gyrations amused him, and he thought it would make a great toy.
James started tinkering with various metals, thicknesses and proportions
of metals, and two years later he perfected a coiled, steel spring that could
spiral from one step to another and "walk" down stairs. His wife Betty went
to a dictionary and found the word "Slinky." The Jameses persuaded the Gimbles
store in Philadelphia to allow them to set up a sloped board in the toy
department where "Slinky" could walk. Within 90 minutes, all 400 in stock
were sold.</B>
<P>
<B> In 1945, they set up James Industries in Hollidaysburg, PA, which continues
to manufacture Slinky products under the watchful eye of Betty James. In
the 1990's, the Slinky line includes a Slinky Junior, two-color plastic Slinkys,
Slinky eyeballs and neon Slinkys. The company also manufactures Playshapes
construction toys and Dabblin Dough molding compound, but the original Slinky
still outsells all other toys.</B>

<B>Founded in 1941 as a family-run workshop in a Manhattan loft employing
six leather artisans, Coach continues to make its home in New York City,
though its workforce has expanded to 5000 since its humble beginnings. Coach's
founders were inspired by the leather used to create the classic American
baseball glove. They learned that handling of this leather over time resulted
in a unique suppleness. Through an innovative tanning process, Coach refined
glove-tanned leather, making it softer, stronger and colorfast. Each Coach
product is made one item at a time by skilled leather workers, many of whom
have worked for the company for over 20 years and are valued for their talent
and expertise. With precision and accuracy, they carefully create exquisite
leathergoods using up to 85 steps to complete one product. </B>

2 million square feet of manufacturing and distributing facilities. </B>
<P>
<B>The Pfaltzgraff family, German immigrant potters, began the business in
1811 in York, Pennsylvania, which is still company headquarters. Early
decorations of Pfaltzgraff pottery took the form of German or English sayings,
figures, flowers, animals and patriotic themes. Today, Pfaltzgraff offers
a continuously expanding and evolving line of dinnerware and table accessories
that reflect current home design and lifestyle trends. Several of Pfaltzgraff's
patterns regularly appear on the nation's "Top 10" bridal registry list of
casual dinnerware patterns. The company also markets high-quality stainless
steel flatware, beverageware, and a full line of glass gift and serveware.
Currently, Pfaltzgraff is successfully introducing its brand to countries

waterski industry" with the revolutionary design of its G-Series slalom skis.
For 1996, O'Brien has created an Anti Drift Mini Fin(tm) for its G3 Revenge,
which will allow the skier to hold even sharper angles through the wake.
In addition, O'Brien is introducing designs for wakeboards like the Double
Ender, Full Nelson and Uro Flex High Wrap which will allow for more edge
and body control. O'Brien has also designed the Rumor Pro, Rumor Comp and
BFS for advanced slalom skiers over 175 pounds, and the new G1 Intruder for
competitive junior skiers under 120 pounds.</B>

<B>In 1912, a 14-year-old boy in Jackson, Michigan named Joe Myers convinced
his mother to buy her first electric iron for $2.98. Soon the boy was tinkering
with the single-setting iron, adding an adjustable temperature control. But
Myers did not have any luck marketing the new thermostatic electric iron
until the Proctor and Scwartz Company saw the invention and decided that
it would be a perfect match for the automatic toaster they had just developed.
In 1929, the first "Proctor" iron and toaster were released, inaugurating
a long line of home appliances that offered consumers value and convenience.
Today Proctor-Silex makes millions of irons and toasters annually, along
with automatic drip coffee makers, can openers, popcorn pumpers and toaster
ovens/broilers. In 1990, the company merged with Hamilton Beach.</B>
<P>
<B> While Proctor-Silex's irons, coffee makers and and can openers are now

  <TITLE>The Free Trade Bill of Rights</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff" TEXT="#000080">
<H1>
  The <B>Free Trade Bill of Rights<A NAME=free> </A> </B>
</H1>
<P>
<B>(The Foundation has been accused of being protectionist. Over the last
sixty years the United States has built a framework of worker protection
laws, from minimum wages and maximum hours to occupational safety and health.
We want to protect these measures, and if by doing so we are protectionists,
then we wear that badge proudly. But we are not opposed to real free trade.
This article explains what we mean by free trade. We will have the Free Trade
Bill of Rights introduced in Congress as one of our legislative
initiatives.)</B>
<P>
<B>Free trade never existed. Free trade is a myth that fuels political debate
and drains the U.S. economy. In order for there to be real free (and fair)
trade in the world, all nations must agree to certain ground rules.</B>
<P>
<B>Here is the Free Trade Bill of Rights, which should serve as a standard
for other nations seeking to trade with the United States. As the world's
leading manufacturer, and the only superpower, we should flex our muscles,
using access to the largest consumer market as leverage for making the playing
field level.</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article One.</U> <I>Democracy</I>. The right of the people to vote
in elections for their representative government shall not be infringed.
[Workers in totalitarian nations, like China, are not free workers.]</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Two.</U> <I>Freedom of Speech and Assembly</I>. The right of
the people to speak freely and to assemble shall not be infringed. This article
includes the right to advertise products for sale and to compare products
in these advertisements. [Many countries, including Germany, prohibit certain
comparative ads.]</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Three.</U> <I>Prohibition of Child Labor.</I> Children under
the age of fifteen shall have the right to an education and be free from
coerced labor. [There are two hundred million children under the age of 15
"employed" around the world, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil
and many other nations. Many of these children are sold into slavery and
chained to machines.]</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Four</U>. <I>Prohibition of Slave Labor.</I> No person shall
be forced to work or sold into slavery. Prison labor shall be permitted,
however, the export of goods made by prison laborers shall be prohibited.
[China uses prison labor for exports, including political prisoners]</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Five.</U> <I>Trade Unions Protected</I>. Free and unfettered
trade unions shall be protected to the fullest extent of the law. All persons
shall be allowed to join the trade union of their choice and shall not be
retaliated against for joining a union or for soliciting others to join or
to form a trade union.</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Six</U>. <I>Environmental Protection.</I> Emissions from factories
and agricultural chemicals shall be controlled to the maximum extent
possible.</B>
<P>
<B>Environmental laws of the United States shall be the international standard,
but any nation shall be free to establish stricter standards. [Pesticides,
such as DDT which is banned in the United States, are now imported on Mexican
tomatoes.]</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Seven</U>. <I>Worker Safety and Health.</I> The safety and
health of workers shall be protected to the maximum extent possible. The
occupational safety and health laws of the United States shall be the
international standard, but any nation shall be free to establish stricter
standards.</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Eight</U>. <I>Minimum Wages and Maximum Hours.</I> Factory
and agricultural workers shall be entitled to reasonable wages, in no event
less than one-fourth of the hourly minimum wage in the United States. [This
means that manufacturing wages will rise in the Third World to $1 per hour
or more, giving these workers the ability to buy American products. Now workers
in Nike plants in Indonesia, for example, are paid 14 cents per hour and
cannot afford to buy the shoes that they produce.]</B>
<P>
<B>No worker shall be compelled to work more than forty-eight hours per week.
[The United States adopted the 40-hour work week decades ago, while Germany
and France have even shorter work weeks.] </B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Nine</U>. <I>Barriers to Trade. </I>No nation shall discriminate
against imports from the United States nor impose other barriers to trade.
[Most nations impose more trade barriers than the United States. Many nations
have more favorable trade rules for other nations than for the United States
causing tariffs and duties that discriminate against American goods.]</B>
<P>
<B><U>Article Ten.</U> <I>Illicit Trade Prohibited</I>. Nations shall not
trade illicit drugs, poisonous chemicals or materials capable of being used
in nuclear weapons or in chemical or biological weapons. [When an outlaw
nation provides others with deadly materials, the United States and other
nations have every right to ban trade with that country. Currently, China
has been caught by the CIA with selling nuclear equipment to Pakistan. This
provision would allow the United States to punish China with trade
sanctions.]</B>
<P>
<B>When someone asks you about Free Trade, be prepared with tough questions
about slave labor, child labor and human rights. Free trade only works if
everyone plays by the same rules.</B>

  <B>This Week's Topic: Car Wars</B>
</H2>
<P>
<B>The trade war with Japan is primarily being fought with automobiles. The
U.S. trade deficit with Japan totals $60 billion, with more than half of
the deficit due directly to automobiles and auto parts. Even though they
favor their own market, the Japanese have respect for American workmanship,
particularly the Honda Corporation. Honda is manufacturing its sleek Honda
Accord Coupe, and its new Honda Stationwagon, only in Marysville, Ohio, and
plans to export 50,000 per year of them to Japan. The Accord Stationwagon
was designed from the ground up in the USA and will be exported to Europe
and Japan. Thanks to Honda U.S. auto exports to Japan increased significantly
last year.</B>
<P>
<B> According to a recent survey of prospective automobile purchasers conducted
by the Made in the USA Foundation most&nbsp;consumers do not know where cars
are made. More than seventy-five percent of American consumers surveyed thought
that the Pontiac LeMans was made in the U.S.A., when in fact it is made in
South Korea. The majority wrongly believed that the Honda Accord was imported
from Japan. Similarly, Motor Trend magazine awarded the Honda Accord it's
"Import Car of the Year" award for 1994 even though the Accord is made in
Marysville, Ohio! A significant problem, then, is determining what products
are made where so that consumers can make informed purchasing decisions.
</B>
<P>
<B>Because of this confusion in the marketplace Made in the USA was able
to convince Congress that a new law was needed: The American Automobile Labeling
Act becomes law in the Fall of 1994. &nbsp;It requires all new cars to include
the U.S. content of the car on the price sticker. Because of this law every
Saturn will proudly announce that it is 98% American.</B>
<P>
<B> On the other hand the number of Americans who want to buy American products
is rising. According to Cambridge Reports, the number of Americans who made
a conscious decision against buying foreign products increased from 21% in
1985 to 39% in 1989. </B>
<P>
<B>Made in the USA Foundation estimates that in 1994 it now surpasses 50%.
In automobiles, the U.S. marketshare has increased from 73% to 75% since
1992. </B>
<P>
<B> The Saturn is taking the Asian imports on head-on. General Motors assigned
its top engineers to the Saturn division, already resulting in 16 patents
being issued for improvements to automobile technology and Saturn has 15
other patent applications pending. Saturn engineers developed the sixth
generation of anti-lock brakes. </B>
<P>
<B>Joining in the battle is the new Dodge/Plymouth Neon. Finally, Chrysler
Corporation has decided that it can replace its Mitsubishi-built Colts with
a superior American-made product. The new Neon all by itself will save thousands
of American jobs and turn a billion dollar corner in the trade imbalance
with Japan.</B>

	America Needs to Make a Sacrifice
      </H1>
      <P>
      <P>
      <B>America is under attack from all sides and our standard of living is at
      stake. Canada and Europe are dumping imported goods on us, and Mexico, Latin
      America and Asia are invading the U.S. with goods made by child labor. Meanwhile,
      China thumbs its nose at us while subjugating its citizens, employing prison
      labor and selling nuclear arms to Pakistan. Pakistan, at the same time, allows
      the sale of eight year olds to rug manufacturers who produce carpets for
      the American market. And we call this free trade.</B>
      <P>
      <B> Moreover, Canada, our closest ally and friend, has been taking us to
      the cleaners in the trade wars. Canada sells us huge quantities of subsidized
      lumber, but refuses to buy our beer and has been holding the value of the
      Canadian dollar down for years. </B>
      <P>
      <B> While we may have a $200 billion dollar trade deficit for the first time
      in history, most politicians esouse a "don't worry, be happy" attitude. The
      Clinton Administration continues to boast about our exports, yet these same
      policy wonks have ignored the rising tide of imported goods.</B>
      <P>
      <B> Unfortunately, the resulting trade deficit has cost us four million jobs.
      Statistics indicate that six million Americans are now unemployed Americans
      and millions more work for less than they did five years ago. These figures
      do not even mention the fact that many Americans also have to work two jobs
      to make ends meet.</B>
      <P>
      <B> But we can't rely on a government solution to this problem- we have to
      do it ourselves. And we can. While a $200 billion trade deficit sounds
      insurmountable, it helps to look at this problem at the individual level-
      what economists call microeconomics.</B>
      <P>
      <B> If we divide the total U.S. trade deficit by the country's population,
      we find that the average American has a trade deficit of about $740 per year,
      or about two dollars a day. This deficit amounts to the equivalent of buying
      one Japanese automobile every decade, or doing your Christmas shopping for
      a week. Of course, many Christmas decorations are from China, as are many
      toys. But does buying Chinese toys and electronic gadgets that may have been
      made by political prisoners further the Christmas spirit? If you buy a bottle
      of imported beer every day, you may think that it is a small matter, only
      $2 a day. Yet this adds up to over $700 a year, the average American's personal
      trade deficit. Why not try an American microbrew instead? Or if you buy Perrier
      or another imported water every day for a few dollars, why not try America's
      own water, Quibell or Lauret? </B>
      <P>
      <B> Bloomingdale's features elegant holiday gift baskets that include only
      imported products, candy from Holland, apple cider from Canada, cookies from
      Scotland and cheese from France. I received one of these baskets as a gift
      and promptly returned it, trading the gift in for American products. Why
      doesn't Bloomingdales offer a gift basket with a variety of American products?
      It could include olives from California, cheese from Wisconsin, cookies from
      Maine, Salmon from Washington State and citrus from Florida. Instead of bringing
      a bottle of French wine or champagne as a gift for your friends or relatives,
      think about giving them an American present, perhaps something from your
      hometown or one of these regional specialties.</B>
      <P>
      <B> During World War II every American on the home-front had to make sacrifices
      because of the rationing of gasoline, butter, meat and other essentials.
      Now Americans are so pampered that we get upset if our cable service is
      interrupted for a few minutes.</B>
      <P>
      <B>The same could be said for our purchasing practices. Are we so lazy that
      we consider it a sacrifice to look at labels when shopping for products?
      Are we so spoiled that we won't go a little bit out of the way to find American
      products?</B>
      <P>
      <B> Automobile imports remain a large chunk of our trade deficit. We have
      started to sell a small stream of American cars to Japan, but we are still
      flooded with boatloads of Japanese imports. According to J.D. Power and
      Associates, the quality of American cars and Japanese cars is virtually equal,
      with European cars lagging far behind. However, the myth of Japanese and
      European superiority still survives. </B>
      <P>
      <B> If your heart is still set on a Japanese automobile or a European one,
      how much of a sacrifice is it to buy a comparable car made in the USA? Acura
      already manufactures several of its models in America. BMW makes its Z3 model
      in its new state-of-the-art plant in South Carolina. Honda has been making
      Accords and Civics in Ohio for more than ten years. Toyota manufactures its
      Corolla, Camry and Avalon models in California and Kentucky. Nissan makes
      the Quest minivan here, as well as the Altima and some Sentras. With this
      wide variety of "imported" models made in the USA, there is no reason to
      buy an imported car.</B>
      <P>
      <B> For help in buying American products you will need a copy of a book,
      Made in the USA: The Complete Guide to Buying America's Best Products and
      a telephone. The guide shows you how to find top-quality American-made products
      via catalog and by telephone. Unfortunately, many retailers only carry cheap
      foreign goods marked up 400% instead of American-made products that they
      can only be doubled in price. It's really not much of a sacrifice to order
      products over the phone or through the mail because you'll be saving gasoline
      and time. Plus, most of that gasoline is imported anyway, so you will be
      protecting the American economy in two ways.</B>
      <P>
      <B> The truth is, you're not really the one undergoing hardships by searching
      out American products. It's the eight-year olds who stitch Nike soccer balls
      in Pakistan who have made the sacrifices, not the Americans. But the American
      dream can be restored by a new movement, lead by our youngest citizens, to
      look for U.S.-made products. I call upon younger generations to give up your
      Nintendos, Volkswagens, Nikes and Evian spring water. You complain about
      the state in which this country has been left, but now you can do something
      to improve it while contributing to an American revival. The future of America
      is in your hands. Think about this every time you open your wallet- and vote
      with your dollars for American-made products. It's a small sacrifice to
      make.</B>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>California Smog Check II Errors and Facts </TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><BODY BACKGROUND="/pics/bg_svr.gif"><A NAME="top"></A><IMG SRC="/pics/newlogo.gif" ALT="SEMA LOGO"ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR><H1><CENTER>California Smog Check II Errors and Facts</CENTER></H1>Here's an easy-to-use menu of some of the questions most frequently askedregarding Smog Check II, as answered by the California Bureau of Automotive Repairs (SEMA is not responsible for its accuracy or content.)<BR><HR><H4>The Background:</H4><BR>In 1994, the Wilson Administration and the California State Legislature,responding to the concerns of the more than 8,000 licensed smog-check stationswhich make up the state's $480 million vehicle emissions test and repairindustry, entered into lengthy negotiations with the United States EnvironmentalProtection Agency regarding new federal mandates for vehicle emissions controls.At the outset, the USEPA's position was that every vehicle owner in Californiawould be required to obtain a smog check at a centralized &quot;test only&quot;center. The legislature convinced the USEPA to allow California to designits own unique hybrid program, in which only about 15 percent of the vehiclesin the state will be sent to test-only facilities, with the remaining 85percent continuing to obtain emissions tests at traditional test-and-repairshops. The 15 percent of vehicles that will go to test-only/referee centersare likely &quot;gross polluters&quot;--those vehicles with such high emissionsthat they are responsible for at least half of all the vehicular smog inthe state.<BR><BR>Although the hybrid program has the support of the majority of the vehiclerepair industry, including the California Service Station and AutomotiveRepair Association, a tiny segment of the industry remains dissatisfiedwith the compromise, and has spread information that is simply inaccurate.As a result of this campaign, serious misstatements of fact regarding thenew Smog Check II program have recently been aired on late night radio call-inshows, and in paid newspaper advertisements and anonymous flyers. Beloware some of the most often-stated mischaracterizations of the program, repeatedverbatim, followed by the relevant facts.<BR><BR>Here are some of the errors and facts, arranged in an easy-to-read menu,with hyperlinks to the actual solutions:<BR><DIR>  <A HREF="#central"><LI>&quot;The new Smog Check II program is a 'central smog testing program.'&quot;</A><A HREF="#sixty">   <LI>&quot;Sixty percent of vehicles will fail the test.&quot;</A><A HREF="#fail">  <LI>&quot;If you fail the test, your car will be confiscated.&quot;</A><A HREF="#crushed">   <LI>&quot;If your car is confiscated, it will be crushed.&quot;</A><A HREF="#state">  <LI>&quot;The state will run the test-only centers.&quot;</A><A HREF="#thirty"> <LI>Thirty percent of all vehicles will have to go to test-only centers. </A> <A HREF="#hours">  <LI>&quot;Everyone who goes to a test-only center will have to wait in line for hours.&quot; </A><A HREF="#return"> <LI>&quot;Once identified as a gross polluter, a car must return to a test only center every year as long as it is on the road.&quot;</A><A HREF="#factories">    <LI>&quot;The state wants to crush your car so it can sell emissions credits to big factories.&quot;</A><A HREF="#pollution"> <LI>&quot;Cars are not a major source of pollution.&quot; </A><A HREF="#morepollution"> <LI>&quot;Factories are the source of more pollution than cars are.&quot;</A><A HREF="#centralizedprograms"> <LI>&quot;A major company that (operates &quot;centralized programs&quot;) has greased a lot of politicians will have a monopoly in supplying these tests.&quot; </A><A HREF="#seventy"> <LI>&quot;Only 70 percent of cars, or fewer, can be tested in a few remaining local shops...&quot;</A><A HREF="#hundreddollars"><LI>&quot;Tests could cost up to $100.&quot; </A><A HREF="#video"> <LI>&quot;Remote sensor vans will video everyone's license plates and send citations.&quot; </A><A HREF="#saferair">   <LI>&quot;This is not about achieving safer air.&quot; </A><A HREF="#fed">     <LI>&quot;The Federal Government forced California to comply with this program...and your California federal legislators capitulated.&quot; </A></DIR><A NAME="central"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>The new Smog Check II program is a 'central smog testing program.'&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B>As noted in the introduction, California's Enhanced Smog Check IIprogram, is not a centralized program. As a result of the state legislature'ssuccessful negotiations with the USEPA, we instead created a unique hybridprogram in which an estimated 15 percent of the state's vehicles are testedat a test-only/referee center, and the remainder - a full 85 percent - stillobtain tests at traditional privately-operated neighborhood repair shopsand service stations.<BR><A NAME="sixty"></A><BR><B>Error: </B> &quot;Sixty percent of vehicles will fail the test.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B>While it is true that more vehicles will fail than have in the past(because the new, more sophisticated equipment can now test for an additionalhighly toxic pollutant, NOx, as well as more accurately gauge other emissions),the rate of failure will not be anything near 60 percent. No more than about30 percent are expected to fail the test, and only half of those cars --roughly 15 percent of the cars in the state -- are expected to be foundto have such high emissions that they are classified as gross polluters.<BR><A NAME="fail"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>&quot;If you fail the test, your car will be confiscated.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B>   The Smog Check II program does not include a provision for vehicleconfiscation. In fact, the new program does not include any new complianceenforcement measures, but instead relies solely on existing state law. Undercurrent California law, the Department of Motor Vehicles will not issuea registration renewal to a vehicle that fails an emission test. Typically,the California Highway Patrol and local law enforcement agencies issue citationsto motorists who do not comply with registration requirements.<BR><A NAME="crushed"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>&quot;If your car is confiscated, it will be crushed.&quot;  <BR><B>Fact: </B>The Smog Check II program never included a provision for involuntaryvehicle scrappage. The legislature did establish a mechanism for a buy-backprogram as an option available to the owners of vehicles that failed thetest, and who wished to participate in the program. However, it was envisionedthat revenues for the buy-back program, and for a repair-assistance program,would be raised through a $39 fee that new-car buyers would pay in orderto be allowed to skip their first smog check, due 2 years after theirinitial purchase. The program received limited contributions and is stillunder development.<BR><A NAME="state"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>&quot;The state will run the test-only centers.&quot;  <BR><B>Fact: </B>The state will award a legally required minimum of two contracts througha competitive bid process to private industry to operate test-only/refereecenters, much as it currently contracts for existing referee stations.<BR><A NAME="thirty"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>Thirty percent of all vehicles will have to go to test-only centers.<BR><B>Fact: </B>At least for the first few years, no more than 15 percent of all thevehicles in any area will be called into a test-only/referee center forthe biennial test. Gross polluters, once fixed, will be required to returnannually for 2 years to the same centers.<BR><A NAME="hours"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>&quot;Everyone who goes to a test-only center will have to wait inline for hours.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B>That would have been the case if California had agreed to the USEPA'soriginal demands, which would have meant that all the state's motorists wouldhave to have their car tested at a test-only facility. Under the hybridprogram, however, only 15 percent of the cars will be sent to the test-only/refereenetwork. Although the test-only/referee center contracts have not yet beenawarded, two criteria for awarding the contract are consumer convenienceand short wait times.<BR><A NAME="pollution"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>&quot;Cars are not a major source of pollution.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B>Vehicles are the source of at least half of all the smog in California.<BR><A NAME="gross"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>&quot;Gross polluters are not a major source of pollution...thisprogram will not clean the air.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B>Gross polluters, although they comprise only about 15 percent of theentire vehicle fleet, are responsible for half the state's vehicular pollution:that is, a full quarter of California's smog. The Rand Corporation has severelycriticized California's old smog-check program for failing to require therepair of gross polluters which, according to a Rand senior policy analyst,was &quot;a failure because it didn't concentrate on the 5 to 10 percentof cars that are the highest polluting.&quot; Requiring emissions-relatedrepairs for gross polluters will make significant strides in cleaning theair.<BR><A NAME="immediately"></A><BR><B>Error: </B> &quot;Gross polluters must be immediately repaired...at any cost.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B>  Confirmed gross-polluting vehicles must be repaired and broughtbelow gross-polluter levels. After that, if the vehicle still fails itssmog test, there are waivers and extensions available to give motoriststime to same money for the needed repairs. But within 2 years, vehicleswill need to be repaired to the required standard.<BR><A NAME="return"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>&quot;Once identified as a gross polluter, a car must return to atest-only center every year as long as it is on the road.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B>By statute, identified gross polluters may be required to return toa test-only/referee center every year for 2 years.<BR><A NAME="factories"></A><BR><B>Error: </B> &quot;The state wants to crush your car so it can sell emissionscredits to big factories.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B>There is not yet a state scrap program developed. However, the stateprogram will focus solely on mobile source emissions reduction credits,which are not available to stationary sources for swapping. As previouslystated, participation in any scrap program will be voluntary.<BR><A NAME="morepollution"></A><BR><B>Error: </B> &quot;Factories are the source of more pollution than cars are.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B> Most scientists agree that fixed-point pollution has been reducedas much as possible, leaving vehicles as the most significant source ofsmog that can be reduced through more effective controls.<BR><A NAME="centralizedprograms"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>&quot;A major company that (operates &quot;centralized programs&quot;)has greased a lot of politicians will have a monopoly in supplyingthese tests.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B>  There will not be a monopoly. The law requires a minimum of twotest-only contracts, and the state will likely let three contracts. Sixdifferent companies currently manufacture dynamometers.<BR><A NAME="seventy"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>&quot;Only 70 percent of cars, or fewer, can be tested in a few remaininglocal shops...&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B> A minimum of 85 percent of the vehicles will continue to be tested at localneighborhood repair shops, the majority of which are expected to continueas licensed smog-check stations under the new program.<BR><A NAME="hundreddollars"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>&quot;Tests could cost up to $100.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B>The cost of smog tests, as always, will be market-driven. Althoughprices are likely to rise, it is highly unlikely that they will increaseto $100.<BR><A NAME="video"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>&quot;Remote-sensor vans will video everyone's license plates andsend citations.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B> Remote sensing devices (RSDs) will identify only likely gross polluters.Subsequent notices sent to vehicle owners will not be citations, but willmerely require confirmatory smog tests. Those vehicles confirmed as grosspolluters will then be required to be repaired. This ensures that vehiclesonce repaired stay repaired and thus reduce pollution. Remote sensing isrequired in the hybrid system negotiated with, and approved by, the USEPA.<BR><A NAME="saferair"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>&quot;This is not about achieving safer air.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B> Smog Check II, by identifying those few vehicles responsible formost of the pollution that comes from car exhausts, and by requiring everyoneto take personal responsibility for keeping their vehicles properly maintained,will clean as much as 25 percent of the existing pollution from our air.<BR><A NAME="fed"></A><BR><B>Error: </B>The Federal Government forced California to comply with this program...and your California legislators capitulated.&quot;<BR><B>Fact: </B>  California did not adopt the 100-percent test-only program preferredby the federal government. Far from capitulating, a bipartisan majorityof California's state legislature, along with the Wilson administration,worked for many months to create a program designed to achieve three majorgoals: protect small business by preserving the $480 million smog-checkindustry; protect the majority of Californians from unnecessary inconvenience;and the health of all Californians by making our air significantly cleaner.<BR><BR><center><A HREF="index.html">Back to the FAQ Directory</A><BR><BR></center><!--FOOTER START--><table><tr><td width=550><BR CLEAR=ALL><center><HR><A HREF="/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_home.gif" ALT="[SEMA]"></A><A HREF="/cgi-html/contact.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_mail.gif" ALT="[Mail]"></A><A HREF="/searchsema.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_find.gif" ALT="[SiteSearch]"></A><A HREF="/postit/"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_bbs.gif" ALT="[MessageBoards]"></A><A HREF="/cgi-html/list.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_email.gif" ALT="[E-Mail List]"></A></center><br> <FONT SIZE=-1> Last updated: Jan. 9, 1997 by <a href="mailto:aland@sema.org">Webmaster.</a><Br>Copyright &copy Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA)-All rights reserved.<br><align=right><em><strong>This site is brought to you by...<br></strong></em> <a href="http://www.ibcc.com">The Internet Business Consulting Company</A><br> </FONT SIZE></td></tr></table></center><!--1/8/97 4.00 AD--><!--FOOTER END--></body></html>

Dependingon the refiner, these steps or changes will increase production costs byabout 5 to 15 cents per gallon (an average of 10 cents). This includes theadditional 2 to 5 cents per gallon needed to make federal Phase I RFG.  <LI>However, even though RFG will cost more, it makes economic as wellas environmental sense. When compared with other methods of reducing airpollution, such as additional controls on businesses, RFG is a very cost-effectiveway to clean the air.</UL><BR><A name="price"></A><BR><B>Price at the Pump</B><BR>The price of gasoline cannot be accurately predicted because it is influencedby many factors, including production costs, weather, crude oil prices,and product supply and demand. However, it is expected that increased RFGproduction costs will be reflected in the price at the pump.<BR><BR><H2>Facts About Cleaner-burning Gasoline</H2><BR><A name="improved"></A><BR><B>An Improved Gasoline Formula</B><UL>  <LI>Cleaner-burning gasoline is an improved gasoline formula that pollutesless.  <LI>It is not a new fuel, it is still gasoline.  <LI>By spring of l996, all Californians will be using cleaner-burninggasoline.</UL><BR><A name="problem"></A><BR><B>California's Air Pollution Problem Continues</B><UL>  <LI>More than 90 percent of Californians breathe unhealthy air.  <LI>Gasoline-powered vehicles and equipment contribute about half thepollution that makes California's air among the most polluted in the country.</UL><BR><A name="healthbenefits"></A><BR><B>Health Benefits are Significant</B><UL>  <LI>You will have healthier air to breathe. Using cleaner-burning gasolinelowers emissions of pollutants that cause or contribute to health problemssuch as heart and lung disease.  <LI>Reduces the cancer risk from gasoline emissions by more than one-third.</UL><BR><A name="redux"></A><BR><B>Large Emission Reductions</B><UL>  <LI>Provides one of the largest emission reductions in California's longfight against smog by reducing smog-forming emissions from motor vehiclesby 15 percent.

Cleaner-burning gasolinewill not change this.  <LI>Cleaner-burning gasoline did not increase problems in fuel systems.However, testing did show that, on average, vehicles about 10 years oldand older, particularly those with more than 90,000 miles, can experiencea fairly high level of fuel-system problems due to normal wear and tear.Owners of such vehicles are encouraged to have their fuel-system inspectedand to follow their vehicle manufacturer's recommendations regarding maintenanceof fuel system parts.</UL><BR><A name="mileage"></A><BR><B>Gas Mileage</B><BR>On average, cleaner-burning gasoline may result in a very small (less thanone-half mile per gallon) reduction in gasoline mileage when compared tothe fuel that is currently being used.<BR><BR><A name="mileageprice"></A><BR><B>Price</B><BR>Cleaner-burning gasoline costs more to produce. Depending on the refinery,this increase in production cost varies from 5 to 15 cents per gallon. Gasolineprices are determined by competitive market forces. The price you will seeat the gasoline pump cannot be accurately predicted.

Using cleaner-burning gasolinelowers emissions of pollutants that cause or contribute to health problemssuch as heart and lung disease and asthma.  <LI>Cleaner-burning gasoline reduces the cancer risk from vehicle emissionsby more than one-third. Emissions of benzene, a known carcinogen, are reducedby one-half.</UL><BR><A name="work"></A><BR><B>Will cleaner-burning gasoline work in all gasoline-powered engines?</B><UL>  <LI>Yes. You can use cleaner-burning gasoline in exactly the same wayas the gasoline you are currently using. Cleaner-burning gasoline worksjust as well as today's gasoline in boats, jet skis, garden equipment, chainsaws, and other gasoline-powered engines.  <LI>Cleaner-burning gasoline will be available in the same octane levelsas current gasoline.</UL><BR><A name="test"></A><BR><B>Has cleaner-burning gasoline been tested?</B><UL>  <LI>Yes. Under the guidance of an Advisory Committee, which includesexperts representing automobile manufacturers, gasoline manufacturers, andgovernment, the Air Resources Board (ARB) tested the fuel in hundreds ofvehicles and other gasoline-powered equipment.   <LI>More than 5 million miles were driven on cleaner-burning gasoline.This comprehensive program did not identify any increase in problems withthe use of cleaner-burning gasoline.  <LI>Many car parts, especially fuel-system components, fail and requirereplacement during the normal life of the vehicle. Cleaner-burning gasolinewill not change this. The test program indicated that cleaner-burning gasolinedid not increase problems in fuel systems.  <LI>Testing did show that, on average, vehicles about 10 years old andolder, particularly those with more than 90,000 miles, can experience afairly high level of fuel-system problems due to normal wear and tear. Ownersof such vehicles are encouraged to have their fuel system inspected andto follow their vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for maintenance offuel-system parts.</UL><BR><A name="change"></A><BR><B>Will I notice any change in gas mileage with cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>Possibly. On average, cleaner-burning gasoline may result in a very small(less than one-half mile per gallon) reduction in car mileage from the fuelthat you are currently using. Many factors affect the actual vehicle fueleconomy one may experience. These include driving habits, vehicle conditionand tire pressure. Because of these and other factors, even with the samegasoline, your mileage can vary by several miles per gallon from one fill-upto the next.<BR><BR><A name="paymore"></A><BR><B>Will I have to pay more for cleaner-burning gasoline? </B><UL>  <LI>Possibly. Cleaner-burning gasoline costs more to produce. Dependingon the refinery, this increase in production cost varies from 5 to 15 centsper gallon. However, the price you will see at the pump cannot be accuratelypredicted.   <LI>The price of cleaner-burning gasoline is subject to and will be determinedby competitive forces in the marketplace. Many factors including productioncosts, weather, crude oil prices, taxes and supply and demand affect gasolineprices.   <LI>It is expected that at least some of the increased cost to make cleaner-burninggasoline will be reflected in prices at the pump.</UL><BR><A name="ingredients"></A><BR><B>What's in cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR><UL><LI>All gasoline is made from a recipe of basic ingredients. Cleaner-burninggasoline is composed of these same basic ingredients, but is less pollutingbecause the recipe requires more cleaner-burning components and fewer toxiccompounds.<BR><LI>The general cleaner-burning gasoline recipe:<UL>  <LI>Reduces benzene (a known human carcinogen) in gasoline by one-half  <LI>Lowers the amount of fuel that evaporates from your vehicle;  <LI>Reduces the amount of sulfur in gasoline by 80 percent, which allowsyour vehicle catalyst to perform more effectively;  <LI>Reduces aromatic hydrocarbons, a part of gasoline that contributesto smog-forming emissions; and  <LI>Adds oxygen-containing compounds, which allow gasoline to burn morecompletely in your engine. Oxygenates have been added to gasoline sincethe mid-1970s to enhance octane.</UL></UL><BR><A name="diff"></A><BR><B>Will using cleaner-burning gasoline really make a difference?</B><BR>Yes. It is equivalent to leaving your car at home one day a week.<BR><BR><A name="toxic"></A><BR><B>Is cleaner-burning gasoline toxic?</B><BR>Yes. Cleaner-burning gasoline reduces emissions and exposure to toxic substances,which result from the evaporation and combustion of gasoline. Although usingcleaner-burning gasoline reduces emissions of smog-forming and toxic pollutants,like conventional gasoline, cleaner-burning gasoline is a hazardous substance.You should continue to take precautions to avoid exposure to gasoline vaporswhen pumping and handling any gasoline. You should never swallow or siphonany gasoline.<BR><BR><A name="reg"></A><BR><B>Does the State regulate the price of gasoline?</B><BR>No.<BR><BR><A name="whyrequire"></A><BR><B>Why did the State require cleaner-burning gasoline if it may cost moreat the pump?</B><UL>  <LI>Healthier air is worth it. Cleaner-burning gasoline is one of theleast costly remaining ways to reduce emissions of pollutants into our air.Its use will immediately reduce more than 3 million pounds of pollutionfrom being released to the air each day.  <LI>Cleaner-burning gasoline is one of the most significant measuresneeded to help California meet state and federal health standards for airquality.</UL><BR><A name="automfg"></A><BR><B>Do automobile manufacturers recommend using cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>Yes. Automobile manufacturers participated in the development of the specificationsfor cleaner-burning gasoline and recommend its use in their vehicles.<BR><BR><A name="warranty"></A><BR><B>Will using cleaner-burning gasoline affect my vehicle's warranty?</B><BR>No.<BR><BR><A name="anychanges"></A><BR><B>Will I have to make any changes in order to use cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>No. You can use cleaner-burning gasoline in exactly the same way as thegasoline you are currently using. The same applies to boats, jet skis, gardenequipment, chainsaws and other gasoline-burning engines. It will be availablein the same octane ratings as current gasoline.<BR><BR><A name="extensive"></A><BR><B>How extensive was the testing program?</B><UL>  <LI>The ARB and industry experts conducted a comprehensive 6-month testingprogram. Hundreds of vehicles, as well as other gasoline-powered equipment,used cleaner-burning gasoline during this program. More than 5 million mileswere driven on cleaner-burning gasoline.  <LI>As part of this testing program, more than 800 vehicles from severalfleets, including Bank of America, GTE California, Pacific Bell, CalTrans,the City and County of Sacramento and California State University, Fresno,were tested on cleaner-burning gasoline. Cleaner-burning gasoline was alsotested on a broad range of other gasoline-burning equipment, including lawnmowers,tractors, leaf blowers, edgers, forklifts, snowmobiles, motorcycles, jetskis and marine pleasure craft.</UL><BR><A name="oneway"></A><BR><B>Is there just one way to make cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>No. Gasoline manufacturers will be making their own decisions on theirrecipe for cleaner-burning gasoline. Though individual gasolines may vary,all gasoline produced for sale in California after spring of 1996 will becleaner-burning gasoline.<BR><BR><A name="1996"></A><BR><B>Is there a program to ensure that all gasoline produced in Californiaafter the spring of 1996 is cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>Yes. The State has a comprehensive compliance program to ensure all ofthe gasoline produced for sale in California after spring of 1996 is cleaner-burninggasoline.<BR><BR><A name="mtbe"></A><BR><B>What is methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and why is it used?</B><BR>MTBE is an oxygenate that helps gasoline burn more completely. Federallaw requires that most gasoline in California contain oxygenates. MTBE isthe oxygenate that most gasoline manufacturers choose to use.<BR><BR><A name="new"></A><BR><B>Is MTBE something new?</B><BR>No. MTBE has been used in gasoline since the mid-70s. In 1995, about 9billion gallons of oxygenated gasoline were used in California, the majorityof which contained MTBE.<BR><BR><A name="oxygenate"></A><BR><B>Is MTBE the only oxygenate that can be used in cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>No. MTBE is one of several possible oxygenates expected to be used by gasolinemanufacturers to produce cleaner-burning gasoline. MTBE is expected to continueto be the most widely used oxygenate in California. Other oxygenates expectedto be used are ethanol and ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE).<BR><BR><A name="mtbeknown"></A><BR><B>What is known about MTBE and health?</B><BR>In some states there were complaints of nausea and headaches possibly beingassociated with MTBE. However, recent health studies have found no associationbetween MTBE and these complaints. California health experts are continuingto monitor other MTBE health studies that are currently being conducted.<BR><BR><A name="smell"></A><BR><B>Does cleaner-burning gasoline smell different from conventional gasoline?</B><UL>  <LI>No.  Cleaner-burning gasoline is not expected to smell differentthan the gasoline that most people are currently using. If an odor is noticed,it is probably from oxygenates, usually MTBE.  <LI>Most gasoline service stations in California use vapor recovery systemsto minimize the exposure of motorists and service-station personnel to gasolineodors and fumes while refueling.</UL><BR><A name="who"></A><BR><B>Who developed cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>The specifications for cleaner-burning gasoline were developed by ARB engineersand scientists in consultation with gasoline and automobile manufacturersand others. Data from thousands of vehicle tests were used to develop thespecifications.<BR><BR><A name="supply"></A><BR><B>Will there be adequate supplies of cleaner-burning gasoline? </B><UL>  <LI>Yes, Cleaner-burning gasoline will be available in California tomeet the demand. However, as we have experienced in the past, it is possiblethat unusual conditions could lead to a temporary disruption in die fuelsupply.  <LI>The State has worked extensively with gasoline manufacturers anddistributors to ensure that adequate supplies of cleaner-burning gasolineare produced and distributed. A mechanism to help ensure adequate suppliesin unusual conditions is in place and ready if needed.</UL><BR><A name="future"></A><BR><B>What if we need to use more gasoline in the future?</B><BR>As in the past, we expect the market will adjust to meet demand.<BR><BR><A name="california"></A><BR><B>Is cleaner-burning gasoline the only thing that California is doing tomake the air cleaner?</B><BR>Cleaner-burning gasoline is only one part of a wide range of programs toimprove air quality in California. Other programs include efforts to cleanup cars, trucks, buses, factories, consumer products and other sources.These programs benefit all Californians by helping to clean the air. Inaddition to the above efforts, there are a number of steps that people cantake to reduce air pollution. These include: properly maintaining theirvehicle, car pooling and planning trips to avoid bumper-to-bumper traffic.<BR><BR><A name="cleanerair"></A><BR><B>Will I see cleaner air with cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>White cleaner-burning gasoline is an important component of our programto provide healthy air for Californians, it will not single-handedly eliminateCalifornia's air pollution problem. However, cleaner-burning gasoline incombination with other programs will lead to reduced levels of air pollutionand therefore better air quality.<BR><BR><BR><center><A HREF="index.html">Back to the FAQ Directory</center></A><BR><BR><!--FOOTER START--><table><tr><td width=550><BR CLEAR=ALL><center><HR><A HREF="/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_home.gif" ALT="[SEMA]"></A><A HREF="/cgi-html/contact.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_mail.gif" ALT="[Mail]"></A><A HREF="/searchsema.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_find.gif" ALT="[SiteSearch]"></A><A HREF="/postit/"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_bbs.gif" ALT="[MessageBoards]"></A><A HREF="/cgi-html/list.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_email.gif" ALT="[E-Mail List]"></A></center><br> <FONT SIZE=-1> Last updated: Jan. 8, 1997 by <a href="mailto:aland@sema.org">Webmaster.</a><Br>Copyright &copy Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA)-All rights reserved.<br><align=right><em><strong>This site is brought to you by...<br></strong></em> <a href="http://www.ibcc.com">The Internet Business Consulting Company</A><br> </FONT SIZE></td></tr></table></center><!--1/9/97 4.00 AD--><!--FOOTER END--></body></html>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>California's "Cleaner Burning Gasoline": Boom or Bust?</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><BODY BACKGROUND="/pics/bg_svr.gif"><A NAME="top"></A><IMG SRC="/pics/newlogo.gif" ALT="SEMA LOGO"ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR><H1><CENTER> California's "Cleaner Burning Gasoline": Boom or Bust?</CENTER></H1><BR><font size=-1>The following information about cleaner burning gasoline was provided bythe Society of Automotive Engineers  and does not necessarily reflect SEMA's views onthis issue.</font><BR><BR>In June 1996 the California Air Resources Board required the introduction of CARB reformulated gasoline phase  2 (RFG) throughout California, although its phase-in began early in the year. The fuel was supposed to reduce ozone precursor emissions from vehicles by 15 percent and reduce the emissions of carcinogenic compounds such as benzene up to 40 percent.<BR><BR>Since then, significant controversy has emerged regarding the fuel and its use. Reports regarding large drops in fuel economy of up to 50 percent (ARB predicted a 1-percent to 3- percent drop), increased fuel leaks and fuel system component failures (especially on older and some imported vehicles), and increased frequencies of vehicle fires were all attributed to RFG. Preliminary testing performed by and/or for CARB had not identified any of these problems. <BR><BR>What are the facts? Are Californians driving leaking bombs (and getting poor fuel economy at the same time)? Or does RFG clean the air in a safe and economical fashion as "advertised?" My employer, the Automobile Club of Southern California, decided to try to find out. <BR><BR>In late winter 1996 we performed a small test utilizing the Federal Test Procedure (on our emission dynamometer) to evaluate the effects of the fuel on fuel economy and tailpipe emissions. We also used a test track to evaluate acceleration (SAE recommended Practice J1491) and measured interior noise levels as well. Also, driveability was evaluated on the road under a variety of conditions. <BR><BR>Results of this test concurred with CARB predictions. Emissions were improved about 15 percent; fuel economy dropped less than 3 percent; and acceleration, noise and driveability were not affected when comparing RFG with the base fuel available at the time. <BR><BR>After the release of these test results, the controversy continued and since a short-term performance test could not verify or disprove the reports of deteriorating and leaking fuel systems, The Auto Club decided to follow-up the test program with a survey of motorists conducted in late September. <BR><BR>A total of 10,200 motorists who own vehicles from 1923 to 1997 were polled. Questions were asked about fuel economy, fuel system leaks and repairs and fires. Results include: <BR><BR>FUEL ECONOMY:<BR>Those motorists who consistently track their fuel economy have experienced on average a drop in miles per gallon of 1.7 percent in 1996.<BR><BR>FUEL LEAKS:<BR>About 3 percent of respondents had some sort of fuel system leak repaired in 1996. While this is considered a "normal" overall rate, 5.5 percent of pre-1982 vehicles received repairs in 1996 versus only l percent of post-1981 vehicles. These results may also be "normal," but the higher rate for older cars bears (and will receive) further study. <BR><BR>VEHICLE FIRES:<BR>Out of the entire survey, only 19 vehicle fires were reported. Of these, only one fuel-related vehicle fire occurred since the introduction of RFG. <BR><BR>The bottom line appears to be that RFG is performing as predicted. Nineteen ninety-six  has brought the best air quality to Southern California on record. Further study must continue on older cars to make sure that RFG is not deteriorating fuel system components. <BR><BR><I>--Steve Mazor, Chairman, Society of Automotive Engineers, Southern California Section</I><BR><BR><center><A HREF="index.html">Back to the FAQ Directory</center></A><BR><BR><!--FOOTER START--><table><tr><td width=550><BR CLEAR=ALL><center><HR><A HREF="/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_home.gif" ALT="[SEMA]"></A><A HREF="/cgi-html/contact.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_mail.gif" ALT="[Mail]"></A><A HREF="/searchsema.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_find.gif" ALT="[SiteSearch]"></A><A HREF="/postit/"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_bbs.gif" ALT="[MessageBoards]"></A><A HREF="/cgi-html/list.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/pics/b_email.gif" ALT="[E-Mail List]"></A></center><br> <FONT SIZE=-1> Last updated: Jan. 13, 1997 by <a href="mailto:aland@sema.org">Webmaster.</a><Br>Copyright &copy Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA)-All rights reserved.<br><align=right><em><strong>This site is brought to you by...<br></strong></em> <a href="http://www.ibcc.com">The Internet Business Consulting Company</A><br> </FONT SIZE></td></tr></table></center><!--1/13/97 4.00 AD--><!--FOOTER END--></body></html>

Large areas of Sweden are covered by forests of high commercial
value. Forests are also important for environmental aspects, i.e.
to determine clear cuts. Remote sensing offers possibilities of
regular surveys but due to the cloud cover microwaves are important
to use as a complement to optical sensors. 
<P>
The group has been involved in analyzing the possibilities for
bole volume (biomass) determination by using polarimetric data
from the JPL AirSAR, intensity and interferometric data from ERS-1
and intensity data from JERS-1. Investigations using the low frequency
airborne CARABAS system developed by the National Defense Research
Establishment are also ongoing.
<P>
Images have been provided from Ottenbylund, &Ouml;land, and from
Maine, USA. Field investigation have taken place at Ottenbylund
and it has been shown that the sensitivity for stem volume has
not saturated like higher frequency SAR systems for the observed
stem volume (up to 210 m<SUP>3</SUP>/ha). 
<P>
A <A HREF="WWW_CAR.htm" >program </A>for developing models for
the radar scattering is ongoing. Compared to models developed
at higher frequencies it is important to investigate what forest
properties dominate the scattering, to what extent coherent interactions
take place and to what extent ground penetration takes place.
<P>
Presently the main forestry projects in the group are related
to ERS and JERS <A HREF="insar.htm">interferometry </A>and to

Inversion of ground based and of limb sounding from satellite
of passive observations at sub-mm wavelengths is the topic of
an ongoing project related to observations of ozone and ozone
chemistry. Ground based observations of ozone are ongoing at the
<A HREF="http://www.oso.chalmers.se">Onsala Space Observatory </A>and
<A HREF="http://www.misu.su.se/~martin/odin.html">ODIN </A>will
observe by means of limb sounding technique. Estimation of different
inversion techniques and system simulation analysis are parts
of the program.<BR>

<P>
One of the most challenging investigations using SAR is the interferometric
possibility. This INSAR technique is promising for determining
digital elevation models as well as for land classification. At
C-band, used by ERS-1, the top layer of trees are the main reflecting
layer and an effective height (related to forest properties) of
the forest over the surrounding field can be determined.
<P>
The remote sensing group has been involved in an ESA prject co-ordinated
by Matra Cap Systems for interferometric applications for forestry.
Results will within soon be available on WWW.<BR>

<P>
Remote sensing of the sea ice in the Baltic for support of the
ice breakers have been an ongoing project over some years but
is now finished. The usefulness of SAR imaging has been shown
to be good but a major limitation presently is the coverage. Sea
ice is a very dynamic feature and the area need to be covered
with a 1 - 3 day interval.
<P>
An ongoing project is remote sensing of sea ice in the Arctic
for development of remote sensing methods to determine climate
change influence on the ice as well as navigational aspects. Recently
finished or ongoing projects are: Shipbased scatterometer investigations
of sea ice, Ice ridge modelling, SAR and SSM/I intercomparison,
Ice motion over the Yermak Plateau.
<P>
Some of the activities are illustrated in figure:
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sea_ice.gif"></CENTER>

illustrating field acitivities on the ice surface for measurements
of ice roughness (main picture). The upper figures illustrate
the ship based scatterometer antenna, an ice image acquired with
video, from helicopter, and a sub-image of a SAR image acquired
by ERS-1 (&copy; ESA, ERS-1,1991).
<P>
An Arctic expedition took place in 1991 to the high Arctic with
the Swedish ice breaker Oden and the German research vessel Polarstern.
The same ships participated in an <A HREF="AO-96.htm">expedition in 1996</A>.
<P>
In 1991 the very first ERS-1 SAR images at high latitudes in connection
with a field experiment were acquired for the program onboard
Oden for Remote Sensing and Sea ice (Jan Askne, PI) and in 1996
similarly some of the first RADARSAT images at high latitude in
conjunction with field experiments. <BR>

<P>
The technical aspects of the sensors is the basic aspect in all
the projects aiming at different applications.
<P>
Microwave sensors systems are central and involve technical aspects
of the transmitter and receiver, electromagnetic interaction with
the medium of interest, extraction of information including image
processing etc.
<P>
The technical aspects involve in particular synthetic aperuture
radar including interferometric aspects but also simulations of
different parts of a limbsounding sub-millimtre radiometer system..
<P>
Field observations are basic for validation of sensors is the
connection between the sensor aspect and the application.
<P>
Airborne observations include <A HREF="CARBAS.htm" >CARABAS</A>.
<P>
Satellite observations include <A HREF="http://www.esrin.esa.it/htdocs/esa/descrip/" >ERS-1/2</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.eorc.nasda.go.jp" >JERS-1</A>, <A HREF="http://radarsat.space.gc.ca/adrohomepage.html" >RADARSAT</A>,
