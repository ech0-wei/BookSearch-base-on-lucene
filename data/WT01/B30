<font size="2">Although the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has reported
a drop in casual drug use, no indication exists that progress has been
made on the second front of the drug war--the fight against hard-core
drug use.  ONDCP, if reauthorized, must do a better job of assessing
progress being made under the national drug control strategies.  Also,
ONDCP and the federal drug control agencies need to cooperate more to
develop, assess, and coordinate national drug control policy.  In
particular, ONDCP and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
have had major disagreements over the collection of drug data, and ONDCP
has threatened to withhold clearance of drug surveys to obtain HHS
compliance with ONDCP requests--a move that GAO considers inappropriate.
The three-tiered budget review and certification process envisioned by
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 has proven impractical.  Because of
staff constraints and other factors, ONDCP has limited its reviews
mainly to agency budgets and has only selectively certified
program-level budgets.  The Pentagon submits its drug budget to ONDCP
but does not provide a breakdown of separate &quot;agency&quot; drug budgets,
making budget comparisons among agencies difficult.  Because of the
continuing need for a central planning agency to lead and coordinate the
nation's drug control efforts, GAO concludes that ONDCP should be
reauthorized.

<font size="2">The government's strategy for stopping the production and the
trafficking of cocaine and heroin destined for the United States suffers
from a lack of interagency coordination, poor management of funds, and a
lack of commitment from some foreign governments to combat the drug
trade in their countries. Although the United States has changed its
international strategy on cocaine from law enforcement and drug seizures
in the transit zone to stopping drugs in the source countries, the
executive branch has had difficulty implementing a key part of the
strategy--shifting resources from the transit zone to source countries.
Also, a proposed heroin strategy still awaits the President's approval.
Moreover, the willingness and the ability of foreign governments to
fight the drug trade in their countries varies.  Recent steps taken by
the government of Colombia, such as the arrests of three high-level
members of the Cali Cartel, have been positive, but continuing
commitment is needed.  Even when foreign governments are willing to
fully participate in counternarcotics efforts, they often lack the
necessary resources.  Extensive corruption in some countries further
weakens efforts to counter the drug trade.

B-259728

June 23, 1995

The Honorable Karen L.  Thurman
Ranking Minority Member
Subcommittee on National Security,
 International Affairs and
 Criminal Justice
Committee on Government Reform
 and Oversight
House of Representatives

The Honorable Gary A.  Condit
House of Representatives

U.S.  Attorneys litigate for the government in criminal and civil
proceedings.  They prosecute individuals charged with violations of
federal criminal law.  They also represent the government in civil
cases and collect money and property owed to the government.  By
statute, U.S.  Attorneys are under substantial supervisory control of
the Attorney General.  For example, the Attorney General is
authorized to supervise all litigation involving the United States
and to direct all U.S.  Attorneys and their assistant U.S.  Attorneys
in the discharge of their duties.\1

The Executive Office for U.S.  Attorneys (EOUSA), located in the
Department of Justice, provides assistance and coordination services
for 93 U.S.  Attorneys.  In practice, the U.S.  Attorneys exercise a
large degree of independence and discretion in the handling of their
cases.  This independence and discretion stem from several factors,
including historic precedent, the appointment process for U.S. 
Attorneys, and their ties to the districts they serve. 

In view of the independence and discretion exercised by U.S. 
Attorneys in determining which cases to prosecute and recent growth
in the size and cost of their operations, the Chairman of the former
Subcommittee on Information, Justice, Transportation and Agriculture,
House Committee on Government Operations, asked us to review several
issues relating to U.S.  Attorney priorities.  Specifically, he asked
(1) how the Justice Department communicates national priorities to
the U.S.  Attorneys, (2) how selected U.S.  Attorneys establish their
priorities and coordinate them with law enforcement agencies in their
districts, and (3) what, if any, measures Justice uses to assess U.S. 
Attorneys' effectiveness in meeting national priorities. 

During the course of this review, Congress enacted the Government
Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA).\2 The law requires that
Justice and all federal agencies will set goals, measure performance,
and report results.  We considered Justice's processes for setting
priorities and measuring results in the context of the GPRA's
requirements, which are to be phased in over the period of 1997 to
2000.

   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

Justice did not have a specific process for communicating national
law enforcement priorities over the past 10 years.  National
priorities were communicated to U.S.  Attorneys through a variety of
formal and informal channels, such as Attorney General speeches,
press conferences, testimony before Congress, budget memorandums, and
in discussions at seminars and conferences.  Often, priorities were
broadly stated, covering a wide range of crime types.  An EOUSA
official said that national priorities had been so broad and wide
ranging that almost every major crime type could be classified as a
priority. 

Although Justice continued to communicate priorities to U.S. 
Attorneys through a variety of channels in 1994, it moved toward
setting more focused law enforcement priorities.  The Attorney
General expressed commitment to principles of strategic management
and clear articulation of priorities, goals, and missions for U.S. 
Attorneys.  She ranked violent crime and health-care fraud as the
nation's number one and two law enforcement priorities, respectively,
and took specific steps to implement these priorities. 

Justice did not require U.S.  Attorneys to have processes in place to
establish and communicate their local priorities.  Seven of the eight
U.S.  Attorneys we visited did not have formal processes to establish
priorities and communicate them to law enforcement components in
their districts.  Their priorities were set informally on the basis
of the Attorney General's priorities, as well as on the crime
problems and socioeconomic characteristics of their districts.  For
example, government program and procurement fraud was a priority for
one U.S.  Attorney in part because his district was the home of many
defense contractors. 

The U.S.  Attorneys we interviewed were generally satisfied with
their input into the development of national priorities. 
Investigative agency personnel we visited generally said that they
understood the priorities of the U.S.  Attorneys.  These personnel
felt that the priorities of the U.S.  Attorneys were closely or
adequately coordinated with the priorities of their own offices. 

Caseloads and workloads for U.S.  Attorneys' Offices nationwide, and
for the eight districts we visited, indicated that most cases filed
and attorney time spent in fiscal year 1993 were in three broad
priority program areas--drugs, economic/white-collar crimes, and
violent crimes.  Within these broad program areas, criminal caseload
and workload statistics varied for the U.S.  Attorneys we visited. 
See appendix II for an analysis of EOUSA statistics on criminal
caseloads and workloads. 

Justice had no requirements for U.S.  Attorneys to measure their own
effectiveness, and none of the U.S.  Attorneys we visited had
developed set processes for doing so, although they noted various
sources of information that they thought provided indicators of the
effectiveness of their operations.  Justice's evaluation program,
which officials said was the primary means of assessing the
activities of individual U.S.  Attorneys' Offices, covered the issue
of priority-setting broadly, if at all, in the evaluation reports
that were available at the time of our review.  According to EOUSA,
changes were made to the evaluation program beginning in 1994 that
incorporated new methods of determining whether U.S.  Attorneys were
addressing national priorities. 

Due to the unreliability of some data and the lack of other data,
EOUSA could not fully use its information systems to determine how
U.S.  Attorneys were addressing national and local prosecutorial
priorities.  Some existing measures of U.S.  Attorneys' caseloads and
workloads appeared to be inaccurate.  The information systems did not
collect some other information that may be useful in determining how
U.S.  Attorneys address national and local priorities and for other
resource management purposes. 

At the end of 1994, Justice was developing plans to implement the
GPRA's requirements to measure performance.  Justice determined that
performance goals and performance indicators would be required for
U.S.  Attorneys collectively, rather than for individual U.S. 
Attorneys.  The Attorney General asked Justice components to review
existing data to see what elements would be useful as indicators of
performance required to implement the GPRA.  EOUSA had initiated
steps to improve the quality of its information management systems,
though additional efforts were needed.  For example, though we did
not make a reliability assessment of the automated information
systems used by EOUSA to produce annual statistical reports, it
appeared, on the basis of discussions with EOUSA and U.S.  Attorneys'
Offices personnel and review of evaluation reports on the U.S. 
Attorneys' Offices we visited, that data did not accurately reflect
the caseloads and workloads of all of the offices.  Quality control
measures to ensure the accuracy of performance indicators were
lacking, and Justice did not measure the complexity of cases handled
by U.S.  Attorneys. 


   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

The 93 U.S.  Attorneys, serving 94 federal judicial districts,\3

operated out of 195 staffed offices in fiscal year 1993.  They had an
operating budget of nearly $800 million, and more than 4,000
attorneys and nearly 5,000 support personnel to assist them.  The
budget and staff for U.S.  Attorneys grew substantially in the past
decade.  Between fiscal years 1984 and l993, the overall U.S. 
Attorney budget, adjusted for inflation, more than doubled from $340
million to $796 million.  The average number of personnel in U.S. 
Attorney offices also more than doubled in that period from 4,429 to
9,006.

      HISTORIC AND POLITICAL
      FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO
      INDEPENDENCE OF U.S. 
      ATTORNEYS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1

Since the earliest days of the nation's history, almost a century
before the Justice Department was established, U.S.  Attorneys have
prosecuted cases in the federal judicial districts.  The Judiciary
Act of 1789 directed the president to appoint an attorney for each
federal judicial district to prosecute all crimes and offenses
against the United States and all civil actions in which the United
States was concerned.\4 At that time, U.S.  Attorneys prosecuted only
crimes specifically mentioned in the Constitution, such as piracy,
treason, and counterfeiting. 

U.S.  Attorneys functioned without supervision by any executive
agency for about 40 years.  In 1820, Congress paved the way for some
central oversight of U.S.  Attorneys.  Congress gave the president
power to designate an officer within the Department of the Treasury
to oversee U.S.  Attorneys' activities.  About 10 years later,
Congress created the position of Solicitor of the Treasury to oversee
U.S.  Attorneys.  Authority over U.S.  Attorneys shifted to the
Attorney General after the Civil War.  The Attorney General received
statutory authority to supervise U.S.  Attorneys in 1870 when the
Department of Justice was established. 

In 1953, EOUSA was established in the office of the Deputy Attorney
General.  Among other things, EOUSA was to (1) maintain a check on
the overall performance of the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices through
inspections, (2) serve as liaison between U.S.  Attorneys' Offices
and other parts of Justice, and (3) facilitate the exchange of
information and ideas among U.S.  Attorneys' Offices and between
those offices and other parts of Justice.  Including personnel on
detail from U.S.  Attorney Offices and professional and support
personnel, EOUSA consisted of about 277 staff as of February 1995. 

The Attorney General is responsible for setting national law
enforcement priorities and accounting to Congress for how Justice
resources are used to address them.  The Attorney General is the
chief legal officer of the federal government and exercises authority
and responsibility over enforcement of the federal criminal law.  As
head of Justice, the Attorney General is responsible for the
performance of the Department's components and functions.  This
includes both its investigative components, such as the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), and its litigating components, such as the U.S.  Attorneys'
Offices.  With reference to the U.S.  Attorneys, the law provides
that the Attorney General shall supervise all litigation to which the
United States is a party and shall direct all U.S.  Attorneys and
assistant U.S.  Attorneys in the discharge of their duties.  The
Attorney General's responsibility for resource allocation within
Justice includes determining staffing and funding levels for U.S. 
Attorneys' Offices. 

As a practical matter, however, the Attorney General's authority over
U.S.  Attorneys is mitigated by the fact that it is the president who
has the authority to appoint U.S.  Attorneys, subject to Senate
confirmation, and to remove them.  Justice participates in the
appointment process by providing the president with the names of
qualified nominees.  The local standing of U.S.  Attorneys also
contributed to their unusual degree of independence.  As one
commentator observed:\5

     &quot;The [Justice] Department relies upon [U.S.  Attorneys] to
     implement national legal policy as it is shaped by the political
     process in Washington, D.C.  Yet, unlike most other field
     personnel implementing centrally determined policies, they
     belong to and identify with the community in which they serve. 
     Because their appointment depends upon their political standing
     in the community, U.S.  Attorneys frequently feel they owe their
     position to local political personalities and interests.  They
     perform their legal duties in their home territories and plan to
     remain in the community and pursue a legal or political career
     there when they leave office.  Thus, local claims on their
     attention, time, and policies come to rival the demands of
     national policy and headquarters directives.&quot;


--------------------
\4 1 Stat.  73, 92-93.  The Judiciary Act also provided for the
appointment of the Attorney General to represent the United States in
litigation before the Supreme Court and to furnish legal advice to
the president and department heads.

The enactment of the GPRA will require Justice and all federal
agencies to set goals, measure performance, and report results. 
Goals must be stated in a way that will allow assessments of whether
they have been met.  Programs may be consolidated or disaggregated,
as long as any consolidation of programs does not omit or minimize
the significance of a major program. 

By September 1997, each agency is to have submitted to the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress a 5-year strategic plan for
its program activities.  The strategic plan should articulate the
organization's fundamental mission and lay out its long-term goals
and objectives for accomplishing that mission.  This plan is to be
updated every 3 years and should serve as the starting point and
basic underpinning of the agency's goal-setting and performance
measurement process. 

GPRA does not require that the goals and objectives be stated as
department priorities.  The goals and objectives could focus on any
of a number of issues affecting a department's direction, services,
or values.  For example, a departmental goal could be to improve
efficiency, measured by a specific decrease in the average time to
perform a certain task or a specific increase in the number of forms
processed or letters written. 

Beginning with fiscal year 1999, agencies are to have developed
annual program performance plans for submission to OMB and Congress. 
Program performance plans are to link agencies' daily operations to
the broad goals and objectives established in the strategic plans. 
The performance plans are to define target levels in objective,
measurable terms so that actual achievement can be compared against
the targets.  When a target has not been met, an explanation of why
not, and what actions would be needed to achieve the unmet goals, is
required. 


   OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND
   METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

Our objectives were to determine

  how Justice communicates national prosecutorial priorities to U.S. 
     Attorneys;

  how selected U.S.  Attorneys establish their priorities, including
     whether they consider national prosecutorial priorities and
     coordinate their priorities with those of federal law
     enforcement agencies and state prosecutors; and

  what, if any, measures Justice uses to assess U.S.  Attorneys'
     effectiveness in meeting national priorities. 

We conducted our review at Justice headquarters and in eight U.S. 
Attorney districts.  The eight districts we visited were the Central
District of California, the Southern District of Florida, the Western
District of Michigan, the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York,
the Northern District of Texas, and the Districts of Maine and
Maryland.  These districts were judgmentally selected to obtain a
geographic representation and a combination of large and small
offices.  The 8 districts did not constitute a statistically
representative sample of all 94 districts. 

We interviewed officials at Justice headquarters.  In each district,
we did structured interviews with the U.S.  Attorney and other
representatives of the U.S.  Attorney's Office, representatives of
federal law enforcement agencies and other federal agencies that deal
with U.S.  Attorneys, and state prosecutors.  At Justice headquarters
and in the districts, we reviewed records and documents containing
data on priorities, organization, staffing, and operations of U.S. 
Attorney Offices.  We also reviewed prosecution guidelines and 10
evaluation reports done between 1990 and 1993 at the 8 offices we
visited, and we analyzed caseload and workload data for each office. 
Our discussions on effectiveness measures focused on the status of
efforts by Justice to comply with the GPRA. 

We provided a draft of this report for comment to the Attorney
General and received written comments from the Director of EOUSA. 
The comments are summarized on pages 26 through 28 and reprinted in
appendix III. 

We did our work between January 1993 and December 1994 in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards.  A detailed
description of our objectives, scope, and methodology is contained in
appendix I. 


   PAST ATTORNEYS GENERAL
   COMMUNICATED BROAD NATIONAL
   PRIORITIES THROUGH A VARIETY OF
   FORUMS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

Over the last 10 years, Attorneys General did not issue prosecutorial
priorities through any specific process.  According to EOUSA, Justice
did not issue any &quot;definitive lists&quot; of prosecutorial priorities or
maintain historical records documenting priorities over time. 
Rather, Attorneys General communicated priorities through a variety
of forums, such as in budget requests to Congress, congressional
testimony, speeches, and press conferences.  In addition, information
on priorities was included in memorandums to U.S.  Attorneys and
other Justice components as a part of the process of developing
budget requests each fiscal year.  An EOUSA official said that this
often resulted in a wide range of crimes being named as priorities
and provided little specific guidance to U.S.  Attorneys on how to
best direct their resources. 

According to the eight U.S.  Attorneys we visited, the Attorney
General communicated national priorities to them through channels
such as Attorney General and Justice directives, policies, and
memorandums.  Priorities were also communicated through means such as
discussions at meetings, training sessions, seminars, and
conferences. 

Some priorities cited over this period were stated as specific crime
types.  Examples of specifically stated priorities included narcotics
trafficking, public corruption, counterintelligence, and
environmental crimes. 

Other priorities were broadly stated, encompassing a wide range of
crime types.  For example, in most of the fiscal years from 1980 to
1994, white-collar crime was designated as a priority in Justice's
budget guidance.  White-collar crime encompasses many offenses
including:  securities and commodities fraud, financial institution
fraud, antitrust violations, health-care fraud, computer fraud,
public corruption, insurance fraud, bank embezzlement, federal
procurement fraud, and bankruptcy fraud.  Given its breadth, such a
priority provided little guidance as to the relative importance of
the individual crimes or offenses of which it was constituted. 

An EOUSA official told us that a criticism of national priorities in
the past was that everything was a priority.  We noted, for example,
that for fiscal year 1994, a total of 17 priorities were enunciated
in various Attorney General speeches, testimony, and budget
memorandums. 


   JUSTICE MOVED TOWARD
   COMMUNICATING MORE SPECIFIC
   NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
   PRIORITIES IN 1994
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

EOUSA officials told us that they thought Justice would articulate
priorities with more specificity in the future than it had in the
past.  Actions by the Attorney General in 1994 offered specific
guidance about how top-ranked priorities should be implemented.  Even
so, the guidance left U.S.  Attorneys considerable discretion on how
best to approach priority crime categories in their districts. 

First, the Attorney General ranked her two top priorities--violent
crime and health-care fraud, respectively.  Second, she issued
written guidance to U.S.  Attorneys explaining what she wanted done
to implement the violent crime priority.  A national antiviolent
crime initiative was undertaken in early 1994.  Each U.S.  Attorney
was to designate a senior attorney to be a violent crime coordinator. 
Each U.S.  Attorney was also to meet with federal, state, and local
law enforcement agencies in their districts to form a new, or
strengthen an existing, violent crime working group.  Each U.S. 
Attorney was to do a survey to identify and prioritize the violent
crime problems that were susceptible to a coordinated federal, state,
and local attack.  Then, each U.S.  Attorney was to develop a plan to
implement the national initiative. 

Justice also is considering how best to develop indicators of the
effectiveness of U.S.  Attorneys' implementation of antiviolent crime
initiatives.  The Acting Chief of Justice's Criminal Division Section
on Terrorism and Violent Crime said that Justice will probably
require some type of reporting from U.S.  Attorneys on the results of
their antiviolent crime efforts, but officials had not determined
what the reporting measures would be as of February 1995. 

U.S.  Attorneys were not asked to develop plans for implementing the
Attorney General's health-care fraud priority program.  However, the
Attorney General did take some steps to indicate the importance of
this priority program.  She designated a Special Counsel for
Health-Care Fraud within Justice to coordinate all of Justice's
health-care fraud activities.  The Special Counsel has formed an
Executive Level Health-Care Fraud Policy Group composed of
representatives from Justice and other agencies to provide a forum
for discussing and addressing interagency issues.  Working through
the Attorney General's Advisory Committee of U.S.  Attorneys, the
Special Counsel also has requested that each U.S.  Attorney (1)
designate an Assistant U.S.  Attorney to be the health-care fraud
coordinator for their district and (2) participate in local
health-care fraud working groups, many of which are made up of
representatives from federal, state, and local investigative and
prosecutive agencies, as well as private insurance company
investigators. 


   U.S.  ATTORNEYS HAD INPUT INTO
   THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL
   PRIORITIES
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6

U.S.  Attorneys we visited were satisfied with their input into
setting national prosecutive priorities.  They told us that they
expressed their views about which crime types should be considered
priorities primarily through the Attorney General's Advisory
Committee of U.S.  Attorneys and its subcommittees. 

The Advisory Committee was formed in 1973 to address topics of
concern to the Attorney General or U.S.  Attorneys.  A mix of
geographic regions and office sizes are represented on the Advisory
Committee, which is composed of the Attorney General and a rotating
group of 15 U.S.  Attorneys who are appointed for staggered 3-year
terms.  U.S.  Attorneys who do not serve on the full committee may
participate on subcommittees.  Seven of the eight U.S.  Attorneys we
interviewed said that they had input on what national prosecutorial
priorities should be primarily through their involvement with the
Advisory Committee. 

An EOUSA official noted that the Advisory Committee was helpful not
only as a forum for the Attorney General and U.S.  Attorneys to
discuss national priorities, but also as a mechanism to encourage
consistency in how U.S.  Attorneys respond to the priorities.  He
believed that when U.S.  Attorneys meet and discuss appropriate
responses to priorities, this could lead to similar responses in
offices around the country.  If an approach is working well in one
U.S.  Attorney's Office, other U.S.  Attorneys may try the same
approach. 


   U.S.  ATTORNEYS STRESSED THE
   NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY IN
   ESTABLISHING NATIONAL
   PRIORITIES
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7

The U.S.  Attorneys we visited cited flexibility, discretion, and the
latitude to focus on local concerns as key components of a national
priority-setting process.  Six of the eight U.S.  Attorneys we
interviewed said that the priorities communicated to them reflected
an appropriate balance between generalities and specifics and
provided a useful national framework for deciding which prosecutions
to emphasize.  Summaries of comments made by these interviewees
follow: 

  The national priorities have generally been good ones, and we have
     had the flexibility to react appropriately to them at the
     district level.  Very few national priorities apply to every
     district, and I think the Attorney General recognizes that we
     cannot gratuitously respond to every priority that comes down. 
     For example, if health-care fraud is not a problem in a
     particular district, the U.S.  Attorney should not be compelled
     to turn the district upside down looking for those cases to
     address a national priority.  In our district, we have no
     problem with organized crime, so we do not devote resources
     there. 

  The priorities Justice articulates are the right ones.  Where the
     Department falls short is in translating priorities into action. 
     It is bothersome that more work is not going on in some areas. 
     For example, we know that the problems are there in the student
     loan program, with securities fraud and government contract
     fraud, but agents do not have the expertise to work these cases
     and attorneys have limited knowledge of them.  White-collar
     crime is a priority, but the FBI here has only one out of four
     of its squads working white- collar cases.  That one squad
     covers financial institution fraud, health-care fraud, and every
     other kind of white-collar crime. 

One interviewee said that he does not pay much attention to national
priorities, preferring to trust his staff's judgment, focus on local
interests, and prosecute anything that is big enough to warrant his
office's attention.  Another said that he had no problem with
guidance from Justice, but would disapprove of Justice's exercising
specific approval or control over the types of cases U.S.  Attorneys
prosecute. 

Supervisors in several U.S.  Attorneys' Offices stressed that &quot;big
cases&quot; were prosecuted whether or not they were designated as
priority crime types.  One U.S.  Attorney noted that what a case
needs is what a case gets, priority crime type or not.  How much of a
priority the case is depends, in part, on the common sense of the
attorney and supervisor assigned to the case. 


   MOST U.S.  ATTORNEYS SET LOCAL
   PRIORITIES AND COORDINATED WITH
   OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
   INFORMALLY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8

With one exception, the U.S.  Attorneys we visited did not use
formal, structured processes to establish their priorities.  They
usually arrived at priorities informally, after considering the
Attorney General's priorities, their own experience and knowledge of
the district, and input from their staff and representatives of other
law enforcement agencies that investigated the federal matters
brought to them for prosecution. 

The U.S.  Attorneys we interviewed told us that they exercised broad
discretion in establishing the priorities for their offices. 
However, almost all of those we interviewed said that the Attorney
General's priorities as a whole were considered when setting local
prosecutive priorities.  Most of the U.S.  Attorneys we visited cited
health-care fraud, violent crime, and narcotics trafficking as
national priorities that were adopted locally.  However, the degree
to which they adopted national priorities varied depending on the
existence and significance of a particular crime type within their
districts. 

A district's geographic, social, and economic characteristics were
cited as important determinants of the U.S.  Attorney's priorities,
as were the impact, severity, and pervasiveness of particular crimes. 
The U.S.  Attorneys we visited provided the following examples of why
certain crimes were local priorities. 

  In the Northern District of Texas, white-collar crime was a high
     priority because the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area is a
     major corporate service center for the southwest.  Narcotics
     trafficking was a significant priority because of the district's
     proximity to the Mexican border.  Government program and
     procurement fraud was a priority because many defense
     contractors were located in the area. 

  In the Eastern District of New York, organized crime was a priority
     because the area is the residence of or venue for activities of
     major organized crime figures. 

Although they each tended to place more importance on certain
priorities than others, seven of the eight U.S.  Attorneys' Offices
we visited did not rank their priorities.  One U.S.  Attorney, for
example, said that there was no formal ranking of priorities, but
that some issues were more important than others.  He said that the
level of importance depended, in part, on the strength of his
relationship with the particular investigative agency responsible for
that priority crime.  Another U.S.  Attorney said that the relative
amount of resources devoted to particular priorities depended on the
level and types of crime occurring in the district at any given point
in time.  Accordingly, the relative importance of priorities to one
another may change often.  A supervisory attorney in one office said
that the top nine priority crimes were ranked, but he also noted that
there was no problem deviating from priorities if there were
legitimate reasons for doing so, such as significant nonpriority
cases to prosecute. 

Most of the U.S.  Attorneys we visited told us that designating a
particular crime type as a priority generally meant that it received
more resources than nonpriority crime types.  For example, assigning
assistant U.S.  Attorneys to enforcement task forces or special
prosecutive units were ways to emphasize priority crime areas. 


   ONE U.S.  ATTORNEY USED A MORE
   FORMAL PROCESS TO SET
   PRIORITIES THAN THE OTHER
   DISTRICTS WE VISITED
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :9

One district we visited, Maryland, used a new, more formal process
than the other seven districts we visited for setting prosecutive
priorities in 1994.  According to Maryland's U.S.  Attorney, in the
first step of the process, her office determined the crime concerns
in the district and the appropriate federal responses through
meetings with business and community leaders and state and local law
enforcement officials throughout the state.  She said that she and
her staff also met with officials of the federal law enforcement
agencies working in the district.  The FBI and DEA, for example,
provided information on significant areas affecting community safety
and security under their jurisdictions.  Representatives of the U.S. 
Postal Inspection Service and the U.S.  Secret Service provided
information on postal theft and counterfeiting issues. 

In a March 1994 memorandum, the U.S.  Attorney announced a
reorganization of her office according to priority program areas,
which were based on input from within her office and their client law
enforcement agencies.  Prosecutors were assigned to work in specific
priority areas.  Under each of the priority areas, the U.S.  Attorney
identified the types of cases that the investigative agencies should
develop and/or strategies to use in investigating those cases.  She
also revised prosecutive guidelines to emphasize the priority crime
areas. 

At the time of our review, it was too soon to determine whether the
new process was judged by law enforcement officials in the district
to be an improvement in the U.S.  Attorneys' Office operating
procedures. 


   U.S.  ATTORNEYS COORDINATED
   WITH INVESTIGATIVE AGENCIES ON
   PRIORITIES
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :10

All of the eight U.S.  Attorneys we visited said that they
coordinated their priorities with federal and local law enforcement
agencies.  Representatives of federal investigative agencies we
visited generally indicated that they had a good understanding of the
types of cases the U.S.  Attorneys would accept for prosecution and
that their priorities were closely or adequately coordinated with
those of the U.S.  Attorneys. 

Interaction with federal investigative agencies influenced the
priorities developed by the U.S.  Attorneys we visited in a variety
of ways.  One U.S.  Attorney, for example, told us that in developing
priorities, she routinely considered information provided by federal
and state investigative agencies.  In this district, telemarketing
fraud was designated a priority on the basis of consultations with
the federal investigative agencies.  Another U.S.  Attorney said he
emphasized specific violent crimes, such as carjackings, in part on
the basis of the results of meetings with officials of the FBI, DEA,
the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
(ATF), and other law enforcement agencies in his district. 

To gain an understanding of how well they felt they understood the
priorities of the U.S.  Attorneys with whom they worked, we
interviewed 63 federal investigative agency supervisors in the 8
districts.  We asked the supervisors whether they felt that they had
a good understanding of the types of cases the U.S.  Attorneys in
their jurisdictions would accept for prosecution.  Fifty-nine of the
interviewees said that they had a good understanding of the
priorities, while four said that they did not. 

The interviewees said that the U.S.  Attorney's priorities were
communicated to them via written prosecutive guidelines and through
ongoing informal communication among agents and assistant U.S. 
Attorneys.  The lines of communication included discussions of
ongoing cases and conversations at law enforcement meetings.  Several
interviewees also noted that U.S.  Attorneys' priorities were
communicated by the allocation of resources, with more attorneys
assigned to work on priority cases. 

We asked these investigative agency supervisors to describe the
interrelationship between their investigative agencies' priorities
and the U.S.  Attorney's priorities by choosing a response from among
the following categories: 

  Our priorities and those of the U.S.  Attorney are closely
     coordinated. 

  Our priorities and those of the U.S.  Attorney are adequately
     coordinated. 

  Our priorities and those of the U.S.  Attorney are not adequately
     coordinated. 

  None of these responses describes the interrelationship. 

The vast majority of investigative agency supervisors we interviewed
thought that priorities were at least adequately coordinated. 
Thirty-five interviewees said that their priorities and those of the
U.S.  Attorney for the district were closely coordinated.  Nineteen
interviewees said that the priorities were adequately coordinated. 
Two interviewees said that priorities were not adequately
coordinated, and seven interviewees did not select any of these
responses to the structured interview question.  In the two instances
in two different districts that interviewees said priorities were not
adequately coordinated, the reason given was that the priorities of
their agencies did not match those of the U.S.  Attorney. 

U.S.  Attorneys we visited also received informal input from state
prosecutors, especially in the area of violent crime.  U.S. 
Attorneys said that they usually became aware of the state
prosecutors' priorities by meeting informally with them on cases with
state and federal implications or through participation in task
forces. 

State prosecutors' priorities indirectly affected some U.S. 
Attorneys' priorities.  For example, one U.S.  Attorney said that her
office worked closely with the state on violent crime cases and that
historically this relationship had worked well.  However, recent
state legislation increasing state penalties has caused both sides to
re-examine their roles in violent crime prosecutions. 


   EFFORTS TO MEASURE PROSECUTIVE
   PERFORMANCE DIFFER
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :11

U.S.  Attorneys we visited had no discrete processes for measuring
the effectiveness of their prosecutive activities, but they said that
information from a variety of sources provided indicators of the
effectiveness of their operations in fighting crime in their
districts.  EOUSA's primary evaluation mechanism was its evaluation
program, under which a broad review of the overall operations of each
U.S.  Attorney's Office was conducted every several years.  According
to program instructions, the evaluation was to include an assessment
of how U.S.  Attorneys were implementing the Attorney General's
priorities.  The subject of priorities was generally covered broadly,
if at all, in the evaluation reports we reviewed; and Justice did not
require that U.S.  Attorneys implement recommendations made by
evaluation teams. 


      U.S.  ATTORNEYS WE VISITED
      CITED A VARIETY OF
      SUBJECTIVE MEASURES OF
      EFFECTIVENESS
--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :11.1

In discussions on how they determined their effectiveness in
addressing crime in their districts, U.S.  Attorneys we visited did
not cite any single objective measure, but they noted several
subjective forms of feedback and information from a variety of
sources that could provide indicators of effectiveness.  For example,
several U.S.  Attorneys said that they gauged the general
effectiveness of their offices through discussions with and/or
feedback from their staffs and the investigative agencies.  Other
U.S.  Attorneys mentioned, as indicators of effectiveness, the number
of cases they prosecuted and decreases in certain types of criminal
activity in the district.  Also mentioned by U.S.  Attorneys as
effectiveness measures were economic indicators, such as the price of
drugs, and success in coordinating the efforts of various law
enforcement agencies in the district.  A supervisor in one U.S. 
Attorney's Office believed that effectiveness could be measured by
the impact that cases had on the community.  For example, he said
that dismantling the leadership of an organized crime group or
foiling a major plot to distribute drugs could have significant
impact.  However, the U.S.  Attorney had no formal performance
measures to assess the impact such prosecutions had on illegal
activities in the district. 


      JUSTICE'S EVALUATION REPORTS
      FOR MOST OFFICES WE VISITED
      GAVE LITTLE ATTENTION TO
      IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIORITIES
--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :11.2

According to EOUSA officials, Justice's primary mechanism for
assessing the activities of U.S.  Attorney Offices, including how
U.S.  Attorneys were implementing the Attorney General's priorities,
was its evaluation program.  The subject of priorities was generally
covered broadly, if at all, in the evaluation reports we reviewed;
and Justice did not require U.S.  Attorneys to implement the
evaluation teams' recommendations. 

According to an evaluation program manager, evaluation teams composed
of Assistant U.S.  Attorneys visited each U.S.  Attorney's Office
every 3 to 4 years to perform a broad review of its overall
operations.  About 115 to 120 Assistant U.S.  Attorneys served as
evaluators, doing three or fewer evaluations each year.  Evaluation
program guidance required that teams be led by a legal management
evaluator, who was responsible for coordinating and managing all
pre-evaluation activities, the on- site evaluation, and the
submission of written evaluation reports.  Administrative and
financial litigation evaluations were conducted simultaneously with
legal management evaluations, resulting in reviews of U.S. 
Attorneys' entire operations. 

As required by EOUSA's Evaluation Manual, at the end of each on- site
visit, the evaluation team was to provide a briefing on preliminary
findings to the U.S.  Attorney and any key staff the U.S.  Attorney
invited to attend.  The team was then to prepare a draft written
report for submission to EOUSA.  According to EOUSA officials, the
EOUSA director was to forward the draft report to the U.S.  Attorney,
who was responsible for reviewing it and responding to, but not
necessarily implementing, any recommendations.  If the evaluation
team was satisfied with the U.S.  Attorney's action or proposed
action to address a recommendation or was convinced by the U.S. 
Attorney that the recommendation was not appropriate, the
recommendation was to be dropped from the final report. 

One of the purposes of the evaluation program was to determine
whether the Attorney General's priorities were being carried out by
the U.S.  Attorneys.  The evaluation team was to make this
determination primarily on the basis of interviews of personnel. 
Other methodologies available to them included examination of case
management data and reviews of cases.  According to an EOUSA
representative, however, evaluators did not look at actual case files
unless some problem was identified.  Evaluators, in conducting their
evaluations, generally looked at printouts from the case tracking
systems and relied heavily on the results of interviews with
personnel in the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices. 

Our review of 10 legal management evaluation reports prepared during
the period from 1990 through 1993 for the 8 districts we visited
showed variance in the extent to which compliance with national
priorities was specifically reported.  In seven of the evaluation
reports, evaluators made no written assessment of whether or not
national priorities were addressed.  In another two evaluation
reports, evaluators made general assessments about whether national
priorities were addressed.  In one evaluation report, evaluators
treated the issue of national priorities in some detail, relating
resources and case reviews to priorities. 

The general statements made about work in national priority areas in
two reports were: 

  Overall cases here are quality cases.  Many are very complex and
     high profile.  The cases brought are consistent with the
     priorities of the Attorney General. 

  The office is doing a very good job of conducting the government's
     litigation.  Justice priorities and policies are followed and
     applied appropriately. 

A summary of the evaluation comments relating priorities to resources
and case reviews in more detail follows: 

  The office seems posed and prepared to address any of the law
     enforcement priorities set nationally by the Attorney General,
     as well as those that have emerged from district-level criminal
     problems.  This commitment to well-defined law enforcement goals
     is reflected in the prosecution teams set in place by the U.S. 
     Attorney.  He is well aware, for example, that there is a large
     number of toxic dump sites in his district and has tasked .  . 
     .  a unit to step up enforcement efforts in all environmental
     matters.  The same high priority and follow-through is evident
     in the area of defense procurement fraud.  Hard-hitting
     enforcement efforts against drug traffickers is a clear
     priority, and the dedication of five full-time Assistant U.S. 
     Attorneys for the task demonstrates that priority. 

The Evaluation Manual, as updated in July 1993, contained a section
on recommendations, but it did not state whether in any instances
such recommendations were binding on U.S.  Attorneys.  An EOUSA
official said that U.S.  Attorneys were in the best position to know
how to direct the resources of their districts to crime categories. 
He said that draft evaluation team recommendations were reviewed by
the EOUSA director and deputy director.  Before issuing the final
evaluation reports, evaluators were to follow up to see if any
changes were made on the basis of the evaluation results, but U.S. 
Attorneys were not required to make any of the recommended changes to
their operations.  The official said that EOUSA planned to consider
having a team available to help U.S.  Attorneys implement
recommendations. 

In commenting on a draft of this report, EOUSA said that the vast
majority of the recommendations made by evaluators have been
implemented by U.S.  Attorneys.  It said that the EOUSA director or
deputy director or the Deputy Attorney General would have required
implementation of a significant or important recommendation if the
reasons for not doing so were flawed, and it noted that fact would
not necessarily be known by individual members of EOUSA's evaluation
and review staff. 

EOUSA also noted in its comments that changes were made to the
evaluation program in l994 including updated training of evaluators
and additional methods to determine whether the Department's
priorities were being addressed appropriately.  These methods
included review of dedicated attorney and support resources to
certain types of crimes and interviews with federal, state, and local
law enforcement agencies. 


   CASELOAD AND WORKLOAD DATA
   APPEARED TO BE INACCURATE
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :12

Due to the apparent unreliability of some data and the lack of other
data, EOUSA could not fully use its existing information systems to
determine how U.S.  Attorneys were addressing national and local
prosecutorial priorities.  Assessments of what information will be
required and how to ensure its accuracy are indispensable if EOUSA is
to rely on its information system to help measure performance, as
envisioned by the GPRA. 

The Attorney General, in seeking input from Justice components to the
Department's fiscal year 1996 budget request, asked for a review of
existing data to identify which elements would be useful as
indicators of performance and which elements would not be helpful. 

The Attorney General's instructions stated the following: 

     &quot;In selecting performance indicators, components should
     completely review all existing workload data and adapt those
     items that are useful and results-oriented.  Component program,
     planning/evaluation, and budget offices are urged to work
     together to develop new performance indicators that focus on
     program outputs and outcomes, and less on program input and
     process indicators. 

     [Text omitted.]

     &quot;It is recognized and expected that in a number of instances,
     new indicators will be identified for which no baseline data are
     available.&quot;

Some existing measures of U.S.  Attorneys' Offices workloads and
caseloads were inaccurate, limiting their usefulness in measuring
performance and responsiveness of U.S.  Attorneys to addressing
national priorities.  Officials at Justice headquarters and U.S. 
Attorneys' Offices told us that some statistical data in the case
management system and in the system used to track attorney time were
inaccurate and incomplete.  Evaluation reports on several of the U.S. 
Attorneys' Offices we reviewed also documented inaccuracies in these
systems.  EOUSA has not studied the reliability of its case
management information system by checking data against case files in
U.S.  Attorneys' Offices.  However, EOUSA had a project underway
aimed at improving the quality of the automated data. 

The caseload and workload data systems did not collect some
information that could have been useful in determining how U.S. 
Attorneys were addressing national and local priorities, as well as
serving other resource management purposes and measuring performance
as required by the GPRA.  For example, Justice did not measure the
complexity of the cases prosecuted.  It would be difficult to measure
performance without knowing whether cases reported in the information
system were complex, time-consuming cases, or comparatively simple
cases involving little prosecutor time.  Nor did Justice account for
time spent by prosecutors on other than case-specific activities,
such as coordinating task forces, conducting crime surveys, and
developing prosecutive strategies with state and local officials, as
finite categories of resource use.  Knowledge of the time spent on
such nonprosecutive activities would have been helpful to the
Attorney General since she has asked prosecutors to do work involving
planning, coordinating, and managing law enforcement resources. 

In commenting on a draft of this report, EOUSA stated that it had
begun to account for time spent by prosecutors on other than
case-specific activities.  It cited as an example that, as of October
1994, it included time spent in areas related to community coalition
building, Weed and Seed, and/or Law Enforcement Coordinating
Committee (LECC) programs in the time category of &quot;Crime
Prevention/LECC.&quot;


      SOME CASE MANAGEMENT DATA
      APPEARED UNRELIABLE
--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :12.1

We did not make a reliability assessment of the automated information
systems used by EOUSA to produce annual statistical reports on U.S. 
Attorneys' caseloads.  However, on the basis of discussions with
representatives of EOUSA and U.S.  Attorneys' Offices and review of
evaluation reports on the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visited, it
appeared that the data did not accurately reflect the caseloads and
workloads of all of the offices.  EOUSA and U.S.  Attorneys' Office
officials told us that some caseload statistics were more reliable
than others.  The number of cases filed by U.S.  Attorneys in federal
district court was one data element that information management
officials said was particularly reliable because it could be checked
against statistics maintained by the courts. 

Because offices we visited used different criteria to count cases and
declinations (criminal matters that were not prosecuted), comparisons
of caseloads among districts could be misleading.  For example, EOUSA
officials said that there was some variation in the way different
U.S.  Attorneys counted criminal matters and some declinations. 
Several offices we visited did not include misdemeanors in their
caseload statistics.  But one office did include such data, thereby
giving its criminal caseload the appearance of being larger than it
actually was relative to other offices.  A data analyst in a large
office said that double-counting of defendants was routine.  She said
that defendants were sometimes listed under their names and again
listed under the names of their criminal operations.  She also noted
that if two Assistant U.S.  Attorneys were involved in a trial, the
trial may be counted twice in the data management system because both
attorneys would have noted it in their personal statistics. 

EOUSA evaluations of the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we reviewed,
conducted from 1991 through 1993, documented problems with the
reliability and usefulness of the case management systems.  Only 1
evaluation of the 10 evaluations we reviewed reported that the case
information system was generally accurate and used by the U.S. 
Attorney as a management tool.  Eight evaluations reported problems
of varying degrees of seriousness, while the reliability and
usefulness of the case management system was not reported in one
evaluation.  Examples of some of the problems noted follow: 

  One evaluation team found that nearly 300 cases in 1 office were
     assigned to &quot;mystery&quot; Assistant U.S.  Attorneys who did not
     appear on any office rosters.  This evaluation team found over
     1,000 cases that they thought could be eliminated from the civil
     case docket of about 5,000 cases. 

  At another location, an evaluation team found case lists from the
     information system to be &quot;chronically incorrect&quot; and noted that
     improvements were needed to keep track of workload and to avoid
     spending extraordinary amounts of time trying to correct the
     information. 

  A third evaluation team noted that it appeared that cases were
     being carried when there was no activity, thereby artificially
     inflating the caseload. 


      EFFORTS TO IMPROVE CASE
      MANAGEMENT INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :12.2

According to the EOUSA Information Systems Manager, EOUSA tried to
improve the accuracy of the case management data, but had not
attempted to verify its accuracy by matching data on the information
management system to records in U.S.  Attorneys' Offices.  EOUSA
consolidated data tapes from U.S.  Attorneys' Offices and produced
listings identifying some errors, such as nonexistent crime codes. 
EOUSA also worked on improving the quality of its case-tracking
systems in an effort called &quot;Operation Garbage Out.&quot; The goals of
this effort were to update the databases in each U.S.  Attorney's
Office to reflect correct and current information, provide training
in using the data system, recommend steps to improve the quality of
the data system, and increase management accountability for and line
attorney involvement in the quality of the local database. 

In phase one of the effort, U.S.  Attorneys were asked to review all
pending cases that were older than 5 years and close those cases that
needed to be closed.  As a result of this effort, more than 10
percent of the U.S.  Attorneys' pending caseloads were dropped.  In
phase two, U.S.  Attorneys were asked to certify that all cases, not
just the old cases, had been reviewed to ensure that they were
classified accurately.  Phase three involved EOUSA looking at case
management data in greater detail, four districts at a time, focusing
on errors that were common across districts.  The results of the
later phases of the Operation Garbage Out effort were not available
at the time of our review. 

An EOUSA official said that there had been some discussion about
possibly checking the validity of data reported on the case
management system against records in U.S.  Attorneys' Offices, but no
decision had been made on whether to do such a validity check.  As of
December 1994, the EOUSA Information Systems Manager said that
discussions about a new formal program for information quality
management were underway, but no timeframe had been set on when the
program would be implemented. 

The official said that plans were also being made for developing a
new case management system and introducing it nationally for all U.S. 
Attorneys' Offices in mid-1996.  One improvement she anticipated with
the new system was that it would allow for inclusion of specialized
information on priority programs. 


      SOME WORKLOAD DATA APPEARED
      INACCURATE
--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :12.3

Discussions with personnel in U.S.  Attorneys' Offices and review of
evaluation reports on the U.S.  Attorney Offices we visited indicated
that data on the amount of time prosecutors spend on various
prosecutive activities were inaccurate.  According to EOUSA
officials, prosecutors completed resource summary reports (USA Form
5) at least monthly, estimating the percentage of time they spent
working during the month in 24 criminal division crime categories and
25 civil division categories.  No guidance existed on how prosecutors
were to determine which categories to use for various types of work. 
In commenting on a draft of our report, EOUSA provided guidance dated
December 27, 1994, on how to charge time to various categories of
criminal and civil cases. 

Administrative staff were to compile the information on all of the
USA Form 5s completed in their offices and send it to EOUSA each
month.  EOUSA was to consolidate the information into a single
database.  During our review, EOUSA was working toward automated
transmission of USA Form 5 data from U.S.  Attorneys' Offices to
Justice headquarters. 

Representatives of some of the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visited
indicated that the time-tracking data were inaccurate and unreliable. 
One concern expressed was that some attorneys were not diligent in
reporting their time; therefore, work was underreported or did not
accurately reflect the types of prosecutions the office handled. 
Another concern was that there was uncertainty about which time
categories to charge for some work, particularly on economic crime
cases.  One Assistant U.S.  Attorney said, for example, that
distinctions between credit card fraud and bank fraud or credit card
fraud and telemarketing fraud were not always clear.  Thus, data on
hours worked on each of these crime types could be inconsistent from
one office to another and one attorney to another. 

Evaluation reports we reviewed also documented inaccuracies in
reporting time spent on various types of cases.  For example, one
evaluation report noted that civil section attorneys in the office
completed USA Form 5s monthly from memory or by estimation.  Another
evaluation report found that some prosecutors were reluctant to keep
and report necessary USA Form 5 information, although the
administrative officer indicated that continued efforts were being
made to get all staff to cooperate. 

EOUSA officials said that no efforts had been made to verify the
accuracy of the data showing attorney time spent on various types of
cases. 


      ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT
      INFORMATION COULD BE USEFUL
--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :12.4

In the course of our review, we noted two measures that Justice did
not include in its information systems that could have helped to
assess how U.S.  Attorneys addressed priority programs.  These
measures may have also served other management purposes, such as
resource allocation and performance measurement, as required by the
GPRA.  These measures were (1) attorney time spent on coordination,
outreach, and other nonprosecutive functions and (2) case complexity. 

Knowledge of the time spent on nonprosecutive activities would have
been helpful to the Attorney General since she asked prosecutors to
do work involving planning, coordinating, and managing law
enforcement resources and community outreach.  The resource summary
information system that was in place at the time of our review did
not measure time spent by attorneys on these functions. 

A key challenge that the Attorney General gave U.S.  Attorneys at
their January 1994 conference was to increase their efforts to
coordinate the work of law enforcement agencies to avoid overlap and
direct investigative resources in the best manner possible.  Also, a
key component of Justice's antiviolent crime initiative is to
cooperate with other law enforcement authorities.  The work that the
U.S.  Attorneys put into the initiative by organizing and attending
task force meetings and surveying the law enforcement community was
not reflected in raw numbers of cases. 

We asked supervisory attorneys in several U.S.  Attorneys' Offices
how they accounted for time spent on such tasks as planning,
coordinating task forces, and surveying the community about crime
concerns.  The attorneys said the time would probably come under a
particular crime type such as &quot;violent crime,&quot; or under the general
category of &quot;management and administration.&quot; They said that
distinctions between time spent on prosecutive functions versus
planning, community outreach, and coordinating and managing resources
was not reflected. 

One supervisory Assistant U.S.  Attorney noted that some of the work
in his office was not really measured by any time-charge activity. 
He said attorneys spent a fair amount of time talking to high schools
and community groups; helping police departments apply for grants;
bringing federal, state, and local investigative resources together
to address crime problems; and doing other types of nonprosecutive
tasks.  The attorney said that such time would have been charged in
his office either to the subject matter of the meetings or to a
general category of management and administration. 

It is difficult to measure performance without knowing whether cases
reported in the information system are complex, time- consuming cases
or comparatively simple cases that involve little prosecutor time. 
Justice does not assess the complexity, quality, or impact of cases
prosecuted, although two U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visited made
assessments of case complexity on their own.  Supervisors assigned
complexity ratings to cases on scales from one to three. 

A case filed is statistically one case whether it was a
plea-bargained, relatively low-level drug prosecution requiring a few
hours of one prosecutor's time or a complex drug trafficking
conspiracy case that took several years and a large amount of
attorney resources to prosecute.  The amount of time spent by
attorneys prosecuting various cases could serve as one indicator of
complexity. 

The EOUSA Information Systems Manager said that the new information
management system, scheduled to be piloted during 1995, would have a
data field for offices to assign complexity weightings to cases. 
However, no data on that field would be collected nationally.  U.S. 
Attorneys' Offices would have the option to use or not use the field
as a local management tool.  The manager noted that without specific
case weighting criteria, offices might tend to skew weights to the
high side if they were being compared to case weights in other
offices. 


   CONCLUSIONS
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :13

As the nation's chief law enforcement officer and head of the Justice
Department, the Attorney General is responsible and accountable to
Congress for ensuring that the federal law enforcement components
within Justice are effectively coordinated, that Justice resources
are effectively applied, and that national law enforcement priorities
are addressed appropriately.  Enactment of the GPRA reinforces the
importance of these responsibilities.  To accomplish them, the
Attorney General needs clear information on how U.S.  Attorney
resources are directed nationwide to various law enforcement
priorities. 

At the same time, U.S.  Attorneys need to retain flexibility to
address the specific crime problems that exist in their districts and
to adapt national priorities to best meet local conditions.  Close
consultation between Justice and the U.S.  Attorneys is essential to
strike an appropriate balance. 

The Attorney General's recent identification and ranking of two top
national priorities moved Justice in the direction of setting more
focused national law enforcement priorities, as did her requirement
that U.S.  Attorneys take actions to implement the two priorities. 
While these steps focused national priorities, they also afforded
U.S.  Attorneys considerable discretion in deciding which specific
steps to take in their districts to implement the two priorities. 

More accurate and complete data would help Justice to better
determine how U.S.  Attorneys are implementing national and local
priority programs and to comply with the GPRA.  Although EOUSA was
continuing to take steps to improve the accuracy of its information
systems, the caseload and workload data contained inaccuracies that
could hinder Justice's efforts to measure performance and track how
well U.S.  Attorneys are implementing national priorities and
otherwise applying their resources.  As Justice moves into the GPRA
environment and considers whether data elements that it collected in
the past are needed to measure performance and results and whether
additional data elements would be useful as performance indicators,
it will be important to ensure that the data it collects are complete
and accurate. 


   RECOMMENDATION
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :14

We recommend that, as the Department of Justice evaluates what data
will be selected as indicators of U.S.  Attorney performance to meet
the GPRA requirements, the Attorney General direct EOUSA to develop
quality control measures to ensure the accuracy of the data to be
collected.  EOUSA should give specific consideration to developing
measures of case complexity to be used by all U.S.  Attorneys. 


   AGENCY COMMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :15

We provided a draft of this report for comment to the Attorney
General and received comments from the Director of EOUSA.  The
comments and our responses are summarized below.  EOUSA's comments
are reprinted in appendix III. 

EOUSA reiterated that in our review of eight different U.S. 
Attorneys' Offices of varying sizes, serving communities with diverse
demographic characteristics, none was unaware or neglectful of the
Attorney General's priorities. 

In the draft of this report, we suggested that EOUSA consider
establishing workload categories to measure time spent on
nonprosecutive attorney activities, such as organizing and attending
task force meetings.  EOUSA said that as of October 1994, it began to
account for time spent by attorneys on other than case-specific
activities, and because of this, we did not include the suggestion in
our final report.  EOUSA also said that our statement that it did not
have guidance for attorneys on how to charge time to various types of
cases was inaccurate.  The guidance EOUSA provided to illustrate this
point was dated December 27, 1994, which was after our audit work was
completed.  We added this information to the report. 

EOUSA noted difficulties that would arise in developing measures of
case complexity to be used by all U.S.  Attorneys and said that it
may not be feasible to develop such measures.  However, experiences
of individual U.S.  Attorneys may be of value in exploring ways to
measure complexity.  Two of the eight U.S.  Attorneys we visited had
developed systems of rating complexity on scales of one to three.  In
addition, we were advised that the Deputy Attorney General's Office
was exploring the use of full- time attorney equivalents charged to
cases as a measure of case complexity to help make decisions on
staffing allocations for U.S.  Attorneys' Offices.  If more work time
goes into prosecuting a smaller number of fraud cases compared to a
larger number of drug cases, that would be an indicator of
complexity.  If standards for measuring complexity were developed for
use by all U.S.  Attorneys, the EOUSA evaluation program could serve
as a means to assess the consistency in which various U.S.  Attorneys
apply the standards for their caseloads. 

We agree that development of a system to measure case complexity is a
difficult challenge.  However, unless EOUSA attempts to do so, it
will not have definitive data on feasibility.  Without knowing
whether cases reported in the information system are complex and
time-consuming or comparatively simple cases involving little
prosecutor time, performance measurement will have little objective
value. 

EOUSA did not mention our recommendation that it develop quality
control measures to ensure the accuracy of data to be collected as
performance indicators.  However, the senior counsel to EOUSA's
director told us, in a follow-up discussion, that EOUSA generally
agrees with the recommendation and is continuing to work to improve
the accuracy of its data. 

EOUSA stated that its evaluation program remains the primary
mechanism for monitoring U.S.  Attorneys' implementation of priority
programs, but noted that, as we relied on evaluation reports done
between 1990 and 1993, we did not take into account changes in the
process that began in 1994.  For example, EOUSA said that evaluation
reports are being modified to report priority programs in a more
organized and recognizable format.  We agree that we did not assess
any improvements to the program that occurred in 1994 because our
methodology for reviewing evaluation reports was to obtain the most
recent reports available for each of the eight U.S.  Attorneys'
Offices we visited.  For the Districts of Maine and Eastern New York,
we reviewed evaluations done in 1990 and the final reports for
evaluations done in 1993 when they became available.  As noted in our
report, evaluation teams visit U.S.  Attorneys Office about every 3
to 4 years.  In addition, there was a lag time of several months
between the date of the evaluation and the date the final report was
available for our review.  Thus, we assessed all of the evaluation
reports available during the course of our audit work. 

EOUSA disagreed with a statement in our report that, according to an
EOUSA official, U.S.  Attorneys were not required to make changes to
their operations recommended by evaluation teams.  EOUSA stated that
members of its evaluation and review staff may not be aware that top
EOUSA management or the Deputy Attorney General could require a U.S. 
Attorney to implement a specific recommendation.  EOUSA did not
provide any specifics on processes through which such a requirement
would be made, nor examples of when or how often such requirements
are made of U.S.  Attorneys.  The handbook followed for legal
management evaluations, as updated in July 1993, contained a section
on recommendations, but it did not state whether in any instances
such recommendations were binding on U.S.  Attorneys.  Because this
information was not specified in the written guidance, we followed up
with EOUSA's director for evaluation and review and included in our
report his statement that recommendations were not binding.

OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY
=========================================================== Appendix I

The Chairman of the former House Government Operations Subcommittee
on Government Information, Justice, and Agriculture\1

asked us to review several issues relating to U.S.  Attorneys'
prosecutorial priorities. 

Specifically, we agreed to determine the following: 

  how the Department of Justice communicates national prosecutorial
     priorities to U.S.  Attorneys;

  how selected U.S.  Attorneys establish their priorities, including
     whether they consider national prosecutorial priorities and
     coordinate their priorities with those of federal law
     enforcement agencies and state prosecutors; and

  what, if any, measures Justice uses to assess U.S.  Attorneys'
     effectiveness in meeting national priorities. 

To address the first objective, we interviewed Justice officials and
obtained documentation on how national prosecutorial priorities are
developed and communicated.  We reviewed budget memorandums
addressing priorities, as well as Attorney General speeches,
testimonies, and communications.  We also asked U.S.  Attorneys how
national priorities were communicated to them. 

To address the second objective, we did structured interviews in
eight U.S.  Attorneys' Offices.  We interviewed U.S.  Attorneys\2

and key staff in each U.S.  Attorneys' Office.  We also did
structured interviews with officials of eight federal investigative
agencies and a state prosecutor in each U.S.  Attorney district to
address how U.S.  Attorneys' priorities were communicated and whether
they were coordinated with other law enforcement officials. 

In addressing the second objective, we also reviewed case management
data on the number of cases and matters filed and declined by type of
crime for fiscal years 1980 through 1993.  We reviewed data on U.S. 
Attorney work years for fiscal years 1980 through 1993, and we
reviewed data on hours attorneys spent working on various types of
cases nationally and for the eight selected districts for fiscal year
1993.  We reviewed guidelines established by the eight U.S. 
Attorneys for determining whether to accept cases for federal
prosecution. 

To address the third objective, we interviewed Justice officials and
U.S.  Attorneys and reviewed evaluation reports to determine what
qualitative and quantitative measures were in place to evaluate the
effectiveness of the operations of the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices.  The
Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 requires
federal agencies to implement a system to set goals, measure
performance, and report results.  We focused our discussions for this
objective on the status of efforts by Justice to comply with the law. 


--------------------
\1 In the 104th Congress, jurisdiction changed to the newly
established Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs
and Criminal Justice of the Committee on Government Reform and
Oversight. 

\2 In the Southern District of New York we interviewed a first
assistant U.S.  Attorney who was an Acting U.S.  Attorney at the time
of our visit. 


   SELECTION OF U.S.  ATTORNEYS'
   OFFICES
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1

Table I.1 lists the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visited and provides
information on the criminal and civil cases filed in each office
during fiscal year 1993.  The districts were the Central District of
California, the Southern District of Florida, the Western District of
Michigan, the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York, the
Northern District of Texas, and the Districts of Maine and Maryland. 
We judgmentally selected these districts to include various
geographical regions of the country and small, medium, and large
offices. 

Table I.1 also shows that the eight U.S.  Attorneys' Offices combined
filed about 18 percent of both the criminal and civil cases that were
filed in district courts in fiscal year 1993.

The eight districts also filed about 21 percent of all asset
forfeiture cases (criminal and civil) filed nationally in fiscal year
1993 and collected about 18 percent of the estimated cash and
property recoveries.  They collected about 14 percent of the total
debts collected by U.S.  Attorneys nationwide in bankruptcies,
foreclosures, and other civil debt and property collections. 

As shown in table I.2, the number of attorney positions in the eight
districts we visited ranged from 19 full-time equivalent attorney
positions in the district of Maine to 206 full-time equivalent
attorney positions in the Southern District of Florida.  Combined,
the eight districts had about 22 percent of the total attorney
positions nationwide.

--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2

We did structured interviews with U.S.  Attorneys or acting U.S. 
Attorneys and their first assistants and the chiefs of their criminal
and civil divisions in the eight districts.  We asked them how they
established priorities for their offices, how national priorities
were communicated to them, how they coordinated priorities with
federal, state, and local investigative agencies and with state
prosecutors, and how they measured their effectiveness in the mission
of fighting crime in their districts.  We pretested the structured
interview instruments with U.S.  Attorneys' Office representatives in
Southern New York and Maryland, and we made clarifications and
refinements on the basis of the comments we received. 

We also talked with other division and section chiefs in these
offices about prosecutions of specific types of cases, and we talked
with personnel responsible for the data management systems about how
information on caseload and workload was compiled. 

In addition, we did structured interviews with representatives of
investigative agency field offices and with one state prosecutor in
each of the eight court districts.  We asked investigative agency
personnel for general information about their caseloads, workloads,
and priorities, as well as how they coordinated their priorities with
the U.S.  Attorney.  We asked the state prosecutors how the U.S. 
Attorney coordinated priorities with them and how the priorities of
the U.S.  Attorney affected the operations of their offices. 

Investigative agency interviewees included field personnel for the
Justice investigative agencies.  These were the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).  We interviewed
representatives of the Treasury Department investigative agencies. 
These agencies were the Secret Service, Customs Service, Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Division, and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).  We also interviewed representatives from
two other judgmentally selected agencies in each district.  We
pretested these interview instruments with selected law enforcement
personnel in the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York and the
District of Maryland before we used them in the other locations. 

Table I.3 lists the judgmentally selected agencies we selected to
interview in each field location.  We met with special
agents-in-charge and/or agents closely involved in dealings with the
U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we reviewed.

The field work provided information on how priorities were addressed
in various U.S.  Attorneys' Offices and officials' views on a variety
of issues and concerns about priority setting and how best to use
limited law enforcement resources, but they did not constitute a
representative or statistically valid sample of opinions. 


ANALYSIS OF EOUSA STATISTICS ON
CRIMINAL CASELOADS AND WORKLOADS
NATIONWIDE AND FOR EIGHT U.S. 
ATTORNEYS' OFFICES
========================================================== Appendix II


   U.S.  ATTORNEYS' CRIMINAL
   CASELOADS AND WORKLOADS VARIED
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1

Analysis of the Executive Office of U.S.  Attorneys' (EOUSA)
statistics on criminal caseloads and workloads for each of the eight
U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visited showed that most cases filed and
time spent corresponded to the stated priorities of the U.S. 
Attorneys.  Criminal caseload and workload were concentrated in 3
broad program areas in these offices and for the 93 U.S.  Attorneys'
Offices nationwide.  These areas were drug,\1

economic/white-collar,\2 and violent crimes.\3 The eight offices we
visited also had organizational units dedicated to at least two of
these three program areas. 

Caseloads and attorney time spent within the three broad program
areas of drug, economic/white-collar, and violent crimes varied in
the offices we visited.  For example, drug cases filed ranged from 13
percent to 49 percent of the total criminal caseload in these
offices.  Attorney time spent on economic/white-collar crime
prosecutions ranged from 25 percent to 48 percent of total attorney
time spent on criminal prosecutions. 

Our caseload analysis was based on statistics on criminal cases filed
by U.S.  Attorneys in federal district courts during fiscal year
1993.  Based on discussions with headquarters and district
information management system personnel, cases filed appeared to be
the most reliable statistic in the EOUSA case management system.  Our
workload analysis used EOUSA resource summary reports through which
U.S.  Attorneys reported on the number of full-time equivalent
attorney positions and the amount of time spent in various crime
categories.  Because we had concerns about the accuracy of this
information, both data sets should be viewed as general indicators of
caseload and workload.  (See pp.  18 through 24.)


--------------------
\1 Drug offenses include drug dealing, drug possession, and crimes
prosecuted through the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force
program. 

\2 Economic/White-collar crimes include official corruption;
health-care fraud; environmental, health, and safety crimes;
financial institution fraud; and other frauds, such as telemarketing,
computer, securities, and bankruptcy. 

\3 Violent crimes include firearms violations, bank robbery, and
other violent crimes. 


   ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES
   FOCUS ON THREE BROAD CRIME
   AREAS
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2

The predominance of drug, economic/white-collar, and violent crime
prosecutions in U.S.  Attorneys' caseloads and workloads is
consistent with the organizational structure and concentration of
resources in the eight U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visited.  All
eight of the offices had units dedicated to at least two of the three
major crime areas.  The eight offices all had specialized units for
drug prosecutions.  They all also had units dedicated to specific
types of economic/white-collar crime, such as financial institution
fraud, business/securities fraud, or public corruption.  Within the
violent crime program area, one of the offices had a specialized
violent criminal enterprises unit.  Two other offices conducted
violent crime prosecutions under a narcotics and violent crime unit. 
The other five districts prosecuted violent crimes through
nonspecialized units, such as a general crimes unit. 

Similarly, the resources attached to these units accounted for a
substantial portion, and in some cases, a majority of the resources
of the offices' criminal divisions.  In seven districts for which
data were available, 51 percent of the criminal division prosecutors
were assigned to units dedicated to drug, economic/white-collar, and
violent crimes.  In four of those seven districts, more than half of
the prosecutors were assigned to those three crime areas. 


   MOST CASES FILED IN COURT BY
   U.S.  ATTORNEYS INVOLVED DRUG,
   ECONOMIC/WHITE-COLLAR, AND
   VIOLENT CRIMES
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3

As shown in Figure II.1, nationwide about 28.5 percent of all cases
filed involved drug crimes, about 28.8 percent involved
economic/white-collar crimes, and about 15.6 percent involved violent
crimes.  The remaining 27.1 percent of cases filed involved other
types of prosecutions, including organized crime, immigration, and a
wide range of other federal criminal violations.

In each of the eight districts we visited, the combined total of
drug, economic/white-collar, and violent crime cases filed accounted
for the vast majority of cases filed by the district--from 65.8
percent in the Southern District of New York to 81.3 percent in the
District of Maine.  However, the percentage of case filings for each
of the three crime areas varied widely among the eight districts. 
Figures II.2 through II.9 show the respective percentages of drug,
economic/white-collar, violent crime cases, and other crimes filed in
federal district court for each of the U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we
visited.

   MOST ATTORNEY TIME WAS SPENT ON
   DRUG, ECONOMIC/WHITE-COLLAR,
   AND VIOLENT CRIME CASES
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4

As shown in Figure II.14, in fiscal year 1993, nationwide about 32
percent of criminal prosecutors' time was spent on drug cases, about
32 percent was spent on economic/white-collar cases, and about 11
percent was spent on violent crime cases.  The remaining 25 percent
of the criminal prosecutors' time was spent on other types of cases,
including organized crime, immigration, criminal forfeitures and
appeals, and other criminal violations.

Criminal prosecutors in the eight U.S.  Attorneys' Offices we visited
spent most of their time working in the three large program
areas--drug, economic/white-collar, and violent crimes.  In each of
these offices, the combined total time devoted by prosecutors to
these three program areas accounted for a substantial majority of the
office's total prosecutive time--from 61 percent in the Eastern
District of New York to 82 percent in the District of Maryland. 

Figures II.15 through II.22 show the number of attorney positions
devoted to the three broad priority program areas and to all other
criminal cases, nationwide and for each of the eight districts we

While the largest amount of attorney time in all of the districts was
spent in the three large program areas combined, time devoted to each
area varied among districts, particularly for drug and
economic/white-collar crime prosecutions.  For example, the amount of
attorney time spent on drug cases ranged from the equivalent of 26
percent of attorney positions in the Central District of California
and the Northern District of Texas to 37 percent in the Southern
District of Florida and the District of Maryland.  Attorney time
spent on economic/white-collar crimes ranged from the equivalent of
25 percent of attorney positions in the Eastern District of New York
to 48 percent in the Northern District of Texas.  The amount of
attorney time spent on violent crime ranged from the equivalent of 4
percent of attorney positions in the Southern District of Florida and
the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York to 12 percent of
attorney positions in the Central District of California. 

Figures II.23 through II.26 compare the percent of attorney time
spent in the three largest program areas in each of the districts to
the percent of attorney time spent nationally.  The figures show the
differences in how criminal attorney time was spent by the U.S. 
Attorneys' Offices we visited.

COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE
========================================================== Appendix II



(See figure in printed edition.)



(See figure in printed edition.)



(See figure in printed edition.)



(See figure in printed edition.)



(See figure in printed edition.)


The following are GAO's comments on the Department of Justice's
letter dated April 13, 1995. 


   GAO COMMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:5

1.  While we discussed the role of the Attorney General's Advisory
Committee of U.S.  Attorneys as a forum for U.S.  Attorneys to have
input into setting national prosecutive priorities, we did not
explore the involvement of this group in coordinating priorities
among Justice components because we focused on coordination among law
enforcement agencies at the level of individual U.S.  Attorney
districts. 

2.  We noted that priorities were communicated to U.S.  Attorneys
through a variety of forums, including most of those EOUSA cited. 
Among the forums we cited as examples were Attorney General and
Justice directives, training sessions, seminars, and conferences. 
(See p.  8.)

3.  We recognized that Law Enforcement Coordination Committees (LECC)
were important forums of inter-district communication in several of
the U.S.  Attorney districts we visited.  We referred to LECCs
broadly as law enforcement meetings when citing them as forums for
U.S.  Attorneys to communicate priorities to federal, state, and
local investigative agency personnel.  (See p.  14.)

4.  We agree that we had no means of assessing whether evaluators
reviewed how U.S.  Attorneys addressed national priorities but then
did not mention their findings in their written reports.  We reviewed
final evaluation reports, but we were not provided with evaluators'
working papers and notes. 

5.  While we devoted some attention to efforts by EOUSA to improve
the accuracy of its case management data, including discussion of
actions taken in various phases of its &quot;Operation Garbage Out&quot;
program, we did not note specifically that EOUSA sent U.S.  Attorneys
error listings on a periodic basis.

<pre>
<font size="2">GAO identified programs in the Defense Department's (DOD) future funding
plans for fiscal years 1995-99 for the following 13 categories:
environmental cleanup and restoration, defense conversion, DOD
dependents schools and Junior ROTC, basic research, counter-drug
efforts, humanitarian and foreign assistance programs, civilian
separation pay and military temporary early retirement authority, grants
to colleges and universities, operation of the 89th Military Airlift
Wing at Andrews Air Force Base, medical education and noncombat-related
medical research, support for foreign military sales, antiterrorism
activities, and pay and allowances to jailed military personnel.  GAO
notes that DOD planned to fund about $13 billion to $15 billion annually
for programs in these 13 categories when the President submitted his
fiscal year 1995 budget in February 1994.  More than half of the funds
are in the operations and maintenance account, which traditionally has
funded combat training and other readiness-related items.  The largest
part of the remaining funds are in the research, development, test, and
evaluation account.

B-260307

February 17, 1995

The Honorable John Kasich
Chairman, Committee on the Budget
House of Representatives

The Honorable Charles E.  Grassley
United States Senate

At your request, we identified programs in the Department of
Defense's (DOD) future funding plans for fiscal years 1995-99 for the
13 broad categories you selected.  The categories are

environmental (includes environmental cleanup, compliance, and
restoration);

defense conversion (includes funding to advance manufacturing and
other technologies, to encourage the development of dual-use
technologies, and for other programs;

DOD dependents schools and Junior ROTC;

basic research (includes programs to advance basic and applied
research in universities and DOD laboratories);

counter-drug programs;

humanitarian and foreign assistance programs;

civilian separation pay and military temporary early retirement
authority;

grants to universities and colleges;

operation of the 89th Military Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force
Base;

medical education and noncombat-related medical research;

support for foreign military sales;

antiterrorism activities; and

pay and allowances to incarcerated military personnel. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

DOD planned funding of about $13 billion to $15 billion annually for
programs in these 13 categories when the President submitted his
fiscal year 1995 budget in February 1994.  Program estimates may have
changed as a result of congressional action and subsequent
adjustments to the Future Years Defense Program.\1 We list the
programs included in these categories in appendix I and describe the
programs in appendix II. 

Over half of the planned funds for these programs are in the
operations and maintenance account, which traditionally has funded
combat training and other readiness-related items.  The largest part
of the remaining funds are in the research, development, test, and
evaluation (RDT&amp;E) account. 


--------------------
\1 DOD was unable to provide us the fiscal years 1996-2001 Future
Years Defense Program in time to include more current estimates in
this report. 


   PLANNED FUNDING FOR THE
   CATEGORIES
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

The planned funding estimates for 12 of the 13 categories for fiscal
years 1995-99 are shown in table 1.  DOD was unable to provide
planned funding estimates for pay and allowances to incarcerated
military personnel, so we discuss this category separately.  We also
present data reported by the Congressional Research Service on
programs that were earmarked by Congress.

      PAY AND ALLOWANCES TO
      INCARCERATED MILITARY
      PERSONNEL
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1

DOD could not provide future funding estimates for its pay and
allowances to incarcerated military personnel.  However, the Defense
Finance and Accounting Service estimates that DOD currently pays
about $1 million monthly to over 750 prisoners. 

Most military personnel in confinement continue to receive pay and
allowances while awaiting trial or other disposition.  Some
incarcerated military personnel continue to receive pay and
allowances after a sentence has been rendered.  Any forfeiture of pay
is determined by court members or military judges within prescribed
guidelines.  Under Section 857 of Title 10 of the United States Code,
forfeiture may not be applied to any pay or allowances accrued before
a convening authority approves the sentence. 


      FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS
      EARMARKED BY CONGRESS IN THE
      FISCAL YEAR 1995 BUDGET
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.2

In October 1994, the Congressional Research Service reported on
programs in the fiscal year 1995 defense legislation that were not
requested by DOD but were earmarked by Congress.\2 While they may not
be programmed in DOD's future funding plans, some of these programs
would qualify for inclusion in the environmental and medical research
categories.  For example,

Congress earmarked $103 million for environmental cleanup,
conservation, or compliance at a number of military activities. 

Congress earmarked $307 million for medical research.  This included
$150 million for breast cancer research, $50 million for cooperative
DOD and Veterans Administration medical research, $40 million for
women's health research, and $34 million for bone marrow research. 


--------------------
\2 &quot;Items in FY 1995 defense legislation that may not be directly
related to traditional military capabilities&quot; (Oct.  31, 1994). 


   SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

Funding projections through fiscal year 1999 were drawn primarily
from the 1995 Future Years Defense Program published in February
1994.\3 Program descriptions were taken primarily from the DOD Future
Years Defense Program Structure Handbook.  We verified our data with
the Office of the Comptroller, DOD.  In addition to our work at DOD,
we interviewed officials and reviewed pertinent reports from the
Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service. 
Data on payments to incarcerated military personnel were obtained
from the military services and the Defense Finance and Accounting
Service in Crystal City, Virginia.  We did not obtain written agency
comments.  However, we discussed a draft of this report with
responsible agency officials and have included their comments as
appropriate. 

We conducted our review in January and February 1995 in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. 


--------------------
\3 Program estimates in DOD's Future Years Defense Program are
expressed in total obligational authority.  Total obligational
authority is the sum of (a) new budget authority provided for a given
fiscal year; (b) any balances brought forward from prior years that
may remain available for obligation; and (c) any other amounts
authorized to be credited to a specific fund or account during that
year, including transfers between funds or accounts. 


---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1

We are providing copies of this report to appropriate House and
Senate Committees; the Secretaries of Defense, the Air Force, the
Army, and the Navy; and the Director, Office of Management and
Budget.  We will also provide copies to

DETAILED ESTIMATES FOR SELECTED
CATEGORIES OF DEFENSE FUNDING
(FISCAL YEARS 1995-99)
=========================================================== Appendix I

Tables I.1 through I.10 provide more detailed program estimates for
10 categories.  The support for foreign military sales and the cost
of operating the 89th Military Airlift Wing categories are single
program categories and are therefore not broken down in more detail
in this appendix.  Table totals may not add due to rounding.

<font size="2">Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO provided information on the
health-related services needed and received by young children in foster
care, focusing on: (1) the relationship between the receipt of
health-related services and foster care placements with relatives versus
placements with nonrelatives; and (2) how responsible agencies are
ensuring that foster children are receiving needed health-related
services.

GAO found that: (1) despite foster care agency regulations requiring
comprehensive routine health care, an estimated 12 percent of young
foster children receive no routine health care, 34 percent receive no
immunizations, and 32 percent have some identified health needs that are
not met; (2) an estimated 78 percent of young foster children are at
high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a result of parental
drug abuse, yet only about 9 percent of foster children are tested for
HIV; (3) young foster children placed with relatives receive fewer
health-related services than children placed with nonrelative foster
parents, possibly since relative caregivers receive less monitoring and
assistance from caseworkers; (4) the number of young children placed
with relatives increased 379 percent between 1986 and 1991, which
resulted in the lower likelihood of these children receiving services
associated with kinship care; and (5) the Department of Health and Human
Services has not designated any technical assistance to assist states
with health-related programs for foster children and does not audit
states' compliance with health-related safeguards for foster children.

May 26, 1995

The Honorable Harold E.  Ford
Ranking Minority Member
Subcommittee on Human Resources
Committee on Ways and Means
House of Representatives

Dear Mr.  Ford: 

Foster children are among the most vulnerable individuals in the
welfare population.  As a group, they are sicker than homeless
children and children living in the poorest sections of inner cities. 
Of particular concern is the health of young foster children since
conditions left untreated during the first 3 years of life can
influence functioning into adulthood and impede a child's ability to
become self-sufficient later in life.  Yet, little comprehensive
information is available about the provision of health-related
services to meet the needs of young foster children. 

Last year, we reported that the population of young foster
children--those 36 months of age and younger--changed significantly
between the late 1980s and the early 1990s.\1 The average monthly
number of children in foster care nationwide increased 53 percent,
from 280,000 to 429,000, during this period.  The total foster care
population in the three states reviewed increased 66 percent between
1986 and 1991, while the number of young foster children more than
doubled--increasing by 110 percent.  In addition, we found that a
greater proportion of young children entered the system because of
some form of neglect; came from families where at least one of the
parents was abusing drugs; had serious health-related problems; and
were at risk for future problems as a result of prenatal drug
exposure. 

Understanding the ability of state child welfare agencies to meet the
needs of foster children is critical as policymakers consider
restructuring federal welfare policies and responsibilities.  Federal
monies are currently used to assist states with the cost of foster
care.  Legislation being considered by the 104th Congress would give
the states even greater responsibility for foster children through
block grants. 

Our earlier work responded to your request that we compare and
contrast the population sizes and distinctive characteristics of
young foster children between 1986 and 1991.  This report responds to
the remaining issues in that request regarding the service needs of
young foster children.  Specifically, this report provides
information on (1) the health-related services needed and received by
young children in foster care, (2) the relationship between the
receipt of health-related services and foster care placements with
relatives versus placements with nonrelatives, and (3) what
responsible agencies are doing to ensure that these children are
receiving needed health-related services. 

To develop this information we reviewed foster care programs in
California, New York, and Pennsylvania, the states with the largest
average monthly foster care populations in 1991.  In addition, we
analyzed random samples of case files from Los Angeles County, New
York City,\2 and Philadelphia County from a combined population of
22,755 young foster children.  These locations cared for a
substantial portion of each state's young foster children:  44
percent in California, 81 percent in New York, and 29 percent in
Pennsylvania.  We analyzed electronic databases as provided to us by
state and county officials to select our samples and determine the
number of children placed with relatives and nonrelatives.  Our scope
and methodology are discussed further in appendix I. 


--------------------
\1 We reported on young foster children in Los Angeles County, New
York City, and Philadelphia County.  See Foster Care:  Parental Drug
Abuse Has Alarming Impact on Young Children (GAO/HEHS-94-89, Apr.  4,
1994). 

\2 New York City comprises five boroughs and is treated in the state
database as a county.  In this report, we refer to it as a county. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

Our work indicates that a significant proportion of young foster
children did not receive critical health-related services in the
three locations reviewed--Los Angeles County, New York City, and
Philadelphia County.  Despite state and county foster care agency
regulations requiring comprehensive routine health care,\3 an
estimated 12 percent of young foster children received no routine
health care, 34 percent received no immunizations, and 32 percent had
at least some identified health needs that were not met. 
Furthermore, an estimated 78 percent of young foster children were at
high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a result of
parental drug abuse, yet only an estimated 9 percent of young foster
children were tested for it.  Early identification of HIV-infected
children begins with HIV risk assessment.  Without early
identification, HIV-infected children with mild or no symptoms cannot
receive the early medical care that is known to be effective with
young children. 

We also found that young foster children placed with relatives
received fewer health-related services of all kinds than children
placed with nonrelative foster parents.  Other research indicates
that relative caregivers often receive less monitoring and assistance
from caseworkers.  For California and New York--the states where
placement data were available--the number of young children placed
with relatives increased by 379 percent between 1986 and 1991, while
the number of young children placed with nonrelative foster parents
increased by 54 percent.  Consequently, because a larger number of
foster children were placed with relatives in 1991 than in 1986,
substantially more children were subjected to the lower likelihood of
receiving services associated with kinship care. 

Local foster care agencies continue to grapple with designing
programs to meet the health-related service needs of children.  In
the locations reviewed, agencies have revised health-related foster
care regulations and modified their programs in efforts to improve
the delivery of health care to foster children.  Although the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently increased its
technical assistance to states by contracting for National Resource
Centers,\4 none is designated to assist states with health-related
programs for foster children.  Furthermore, while HHS audits states
for compliance with federally mandated safeguards for foster
children, these audits omit review of compliance with health-related
safeguards.  Given the importance of health care during the first 3
years of life, an improved response to the health needs of this
vulnerable population is vital. 


--------------------
\3 County foster care regulations state the frequency for required,
comprehensive medical examinations for well children.  We refer to
this type of examination as comprehensive routine health care. 

\4 The National Resource Centers assist HHS' Administration for
Children and Families staff in responding to states' questions and
provide free technical assistance to states. 


   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

Responsibility for providing care and services to foster children is
shared by federal, state, and county governments, with HHS having
responsibility for oversight of federal foster care programs.  The
Administration for Children and Families (ACF) within HHS helps the
states to develop plans required under title IV-B of the Social
Security Act; reviews and approves those plans; conducts audits to
certify states' compliance with the safeguards for foster children,
thereby making states eligible for additional federal funds; and
allocates funds to states, among other duties. 

The Social Security Act of 1935 was amended twice to include
safeguards for foster children.  The Adoption Assistance and Child
Welfare Act of 1980 (P.L.  96-272) added most of these
safeguards--such as requirements that the case file contain a plan
for appropriate care and services, as determined by state and local
foster care policies; periodic court or administrative reviews; and a
reunification program to return children to their parents.  This act
also authorized HHS to provide technical assistance to aid states in
developing programs to meet the requirements of the law. 
Furthermore, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (P.L. 
101-239) added other safeguards to the Social Security Act, including
a requirement to maintain health records for foster children. 

A combination of federal, state, and county funds may be used to
provide services to young foster children.  States may participate in
federal programs authorized by the Social Security Act such as title
IV-B, matching grants for various child welfare services; title IV-E,
an uncapped entitlement for a portion of the maintenance of foster
children who are eligible under the Aid to Families With Dependent
Children (AFDC) program; title XIX, Medicaid, an entitlement for a
portion of medical services; or title XX, block grants for a wide
array of social services for children.  In addition, the Education of
the Handicapped Act, part H, authorizes grants to states for early
intervention programs for handicapped infants and toddlers. 

Except for federal title IV-E expenditures, data were unavailable to
estimate federal, state, and county expenditures for services for
foster children.  In the last 10 years, federal title IV-E
expenditures for the administration and maintenance of AFDC-eligible
foster children increased from about $546 million in 1985 to an
estimated $2.9 billion in 1995.  When foster children do not meet
title IV-E eligibility for federal funding, states must bear the full
cost for maintaining these children.  However, some states pass at
least a portion of these costs to their counties. 


   YOUNG FOSTER CHILDREN IN THE
   LOCATIONS REVIEWED DID NOT
   ALWAYS RECEIVE NEEDED
   HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

All young children need routine, comprehensive medical monitoring,
treatment for minor illnesses, and immunizations to grow up healthy. 
In the three locations reviewed, state and county regulations require
that children in foster care receive periodic medical examinations
and treatment.\5 Research indicates that children at risk for serious
health problems as a result of prenatal drug exposure often need
additional assessments and specialized care.  Child development
experts generally agree that health care is particularly important
during the first 36 months of life as language, motor, psychological,
and social skills develop.  Conditions left untreated during the
first 3 years of life can influence functioning into adulthood. 

Some young foster children in the locations we reviewed did not
receive even the most basic health service--required routine care. 
In addition, many children had identified health-related needs that
were not met, including the need for specialized services.  Foster
care agencies refer foster parents to community-based programs and
practitioners, rather than providing the services directly.  Foster
children in the locations reviewed are eligible for Medicaid to cover
the cost of these health-related community-based services. 


--------------------
\5 Regulations include a requirement that children receive an initial
examination when they enter foster care.  Los Angeles County and New
York City require an examination within 30 days of entry into foster
care; Philadelphia County requires an examination within 60 days. 
Children who received a comprehensive examination within 90 days
before entering foster care are exempt from this requirement. 


      ROUTINE HEALTH CARE MAY NOT
      BE ENSURED
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1

Despite state and county foster care regulations, comprehensive
routine health care for young foster children may not be ensured. 
Specifically, an estimated 12 percent of the children received no
routine health care, and 34 percent received no immunizations in the
three locations reviewed.  Furthermore, case files at all three
locations did not reflect the exact nature or extent of what services
were provided in many cases.  Thus, children we noted as having
received routine medical care may have received as little care as one
visit with a physician for treatment of a minor illness rather than
comprehensive or ongoing medical care.  (See table II.1 in app.  II.)

While Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT)
services are one way to ensure that children receive comprehensive
medical examinations, only an estimated 1 percent of the young foster
children in the locations reviewed received EPSDT services.  EPSDT
services are specific, comprehensive medical examinations and
follow-up treatment that states must offer to Medicaid-eligible
children.  EPSDT examinations can serve as an effective safeguard of
a child's overall health and development and as a gateway to other
health-related services.  (See table II.1 in app.  II.)

Children with no known health problems were less likely to receive
routine care than children who were at risk for or had serious health
problems.\6 For the locations reviewed, an estimated 28 percent of
the children with no known serious health problems did not receive
any health-related services.  By comparison, only 6 percent of
children who were at high risk for serious health problems because of
prenatal drug exposure and 2 percent of children with serious
physical health problems did not receive any health-related services. 
Without routine health care, children with no known health problems
are not monitored to identify and treat health and developmental
problems as they occur.  (See table II.2 in app.  II.)


--------------------
\6 Serious health problems of children in our review include fetal
alcohol syndrome, low birth weight, cardiac defects or heart
problems, HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and
developmental delays. 


      SPECIALIZED HEALTH NEEDS OF
      YOUNG FOSTER CHILDREN WERE
      UNMET
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.2

In addition to routine health care, young foster children need many
specialized health-related services.  As we previously reported, an
estimated 58 percent of young foster children in the three locations
reviewed had serious physical health problems, and 62 percent were at
high risk for serious health problems as a result of prenatal drug
exposure.  Many of these children may need health-related services
and treatment beyond those needed by the average child.  (See fig.  1
and table II.3 in
app.  II.)

   Figure 1:  Specialized Services
   Received in Three Counties

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

\a Includes treatment for asthma, syphilis, seizures, and kidney
problems. 

\b Includes blood, laboratory, and radiology. 

\c Includes developmental, psychological, and cardiological. 

\d Includes care for HIV, pneumonia, and failure to thrive, as well
as surgery. 

\e Includes apnea monitors, infant stimulation, and speech therapy. 

\f Includes therapeutic day care and Head Start services. 

Source:  Case file review. 

Although young foster children received a wide variety of services
from health care providers, many children had identified
health-related needs that were not met.  Based on information
collected from case files, we matched the health-related needs
identified and the services received for each child and estimated
that one-third of the children in the locations reviewed had some
identified needs that were not met.\7 These unmet needs included
pulmonary and speech therapy; psychotherapy; developmental
assessments; infant stimulation services; cardiological, urological,
and neurological examinations; and testing for sickle cell anemia,
syphilis, and HIV.  (See fig.  2 and table II.4 in app.  II.)

   Figure 2:  Extent to Which
   Identified Needs Were Met in
   Three Counties

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Note:  Point estimates do not total 100 percent because of rounding
and records lacking data on identified needs. 

\a The point estimates for the three locations varied widely in these
two categories. 

Source:  Case file review. 

Of those children with no identified health-related needs, about
one-half in each location received no routine health care, and less
than one-half received a toxicology screen at birth to detect recent
prenatal drug exposure.  Thus, many of these children may have had
health-related needs that were not identified and, consequently, were
not met. 


--------------------
\7 The number of identified needs per child ranged from 1 to 14 and
averaged approximately 5. 


   HIV-INFECTED CHILDREN NEED TO
   BE IDENTIFIED EARLY, BUT RISK
   ASSESSMENTS OFTEN DID NOT TAKE
   PLACE
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

One particularly critical health need of young foster children is HIV
risk assessment\8 because most young children in the locations
reviewed are at risk for the infection as a result of parental drug
abuse.  Without risk assessment, a child's HIV status may not be
determined early because HIV-infected children can remain
asymptomatic or exhibit only minimal signs of infection for years. 
Recent medical advances in early identification and treatment can
enhance and prolong the lives of these children.  Early
identification is also critical because HIV-infected children should
receive modified immunizations to prevent adverse reactions, and
their exposure to infectious illnesses such as measles or chicken
pox--which are particularly hazardous to these children--should be
minimized. 

While state laws, and the county policies based on them, do not
prohibit HIV testing or the disclosure of test results, some can
hamper HIV testing and disclosure.  State laws and county foster care
policies, where they exist, vary widely.  In some locations,
including the three reviewed, these laws and policies impede HIV
testing and disclosure by specifying the risk factors that must be
present in order to request HIV testing; who has the authority to
consent to testing; and to whom HIV test results can be disclosed. 
For example, for the 36 states with HIV testing policies as of 1992,
one-half of the foster care agencies in the states with testing
policies may not have authority to consent to an HIV test for a
child, even when the child was identified by the agency as being at
high risk for HIV. 


--------------------
\8 An HIV risk assessment compares a child's family history and
health condition against the foster care agency's specified HIV risk
factors to make an informed determination about whether a child
should be tested for HIV. 


      THE NUMBER OF HIV-INFECTED
      CHILDREN IS LARGELY UNKNOWN
      AS FEW CHILDREN ARE TESTED
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1

Foster care agencies in the locations reviewed do not know the full
extent of their caseloads that is at high risk for HIV since no
mechanism exists to ensure that all young foster children are
assessed for HIV risk.  While two of the three locations we reviewed
currently have some HIV risk assessment requirements, one location
did not require risk assessments for all foster children until
recently, and the other has not implemented clear assessment
procedures.  HIV risk has long been associated with intravenous drug
use, but more recent research has established an equally strong link
between HIV risk and the lifestyle of nonintravenous cocaine and
crack users.  Using New York City's current HIV risk factors, which
include nonintravenous drug use, we assessed our 1991 population of
young foster children on the basis of one risk factor, parental drug
abuse.  Accordingly, we estimated that at least 78 percent of the
children in the three locations reviewed were at high risk for HIV. 

We estimated that only 9 percent of the young foster children in the
locations reviewed were actually tested for HIV, despite the large
proportion at high risk and statistics indicating that these are
locations with a high incidence of HIV.  The American Academy of
Pediatrics Task Force on Pediatric AIDS recommends HIV testing for
all foster children with high-risk factors or in areas with a high
incidence of HIV to facilitate appropriate medical treatment and
follow-up.  We estimated the HIV infection rate for children born in
1993 and found that the three states reviewed ranked 2nd, 14th, and
26th, based on national data from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) on blind HIV testing of newborns.  (See table II.5
in app.  II.)

Few data are available on the number of foster children infected with
HIV.  One study reported that the number of foster children in New
York City known to be born to HIV-infected mothers increased 26
percent from 1991 to 1993.  While data were not available for
California and Pennsylvania, 1988 research found that Los Angeles had
the fastest growing rate of AIDS cases in the nation.  Furthermore,
anecdotal evidence suggests that in the Los Angeles area, and the
west coast in general, most AIDS in women is due to heterosexual
contact.  However, according to experts on pediatric AIDS, foster
care agencies do not commonly recognize a history of high-risk
heterosexual contact as sufficient grounds for HIV testing. 


   CHILDREN PLACED WITH RELATIVES
   IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND NEW
   YORK CITY WERE LESS LIKELY TO
   RECEIVE HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

Young children placed exclusively with relatives--known as kinship
care--were less likely to receive health-related services than
children placed exclusively with nonrelatives--known as traditional
foster care.\9 Specifically, children placed in kinship care were
nearly three times as likely as those placed in traditional foster
care to have received no routine health care.  Moreover, these
children were less likely to receive health-related services of all
kinds.  Since studies indicate that children in kinship care remain
in foster care longer, and they receive a lower level of service, the
likelihood is greater that these children will go without needed
services for longer periods.  (See fig.  3 and table II.6 in app. 
II.)

   Figure 3:  Services Received by
   Placement Type in Los Angeles
   County and New York City

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

\a Consists of varying amounts of medical practitioner care and/or
EPSDT examinations. 

\b Includes children who received at least one immunization and
excludes children who were under 90 days of age. 

\c Differences are statistically significant at the 90-percent
confidence level. 

\d Includes treatment for asthma, syphilis, seizures, and kidney
problems. 

\e Includes blood, laboratory, and radiology. 

\f Includes developmental, psychological, and cardiological. 

\g Includes care for HIV, pneumonia, and failure to thrive, as well
as surgery. 

\h Includes apnea monitors, infant stimulation, and speech therapy. 

\i Includes therapeutic day care and Head Start services. 

\j Consists of children placed exclusively in traditional foster
care. 

\k Consists of children placed exclusively in kinship care. 

Young children placed in kinship care in the two locations reviewed
were also an estimated three times more likely than those placed in
traditional foster care to be at risk for future problems because of
prenatal drug exposure.\10 Furthermore, because drug-exposed children
are more likely to be at risk for HIV and developmental delays, the
need for health-related services for children in kinship care is even
more critical.  Yet, only 11 percent of children placed exclusively
in kinship care received specialized examinations, such as
developmental evaluations; whereas, 42 percent of those placed
exclusively in traditional foster care received specialized
examinations.  (See table II.6 in app.  II.)

While we did not determine why children in kinship care received less
health-related care, or compare other aspects of care by placement
type, we reviewed key studies on kinship care.  Research found that
foster care agencies treat kinship care placements and traditional
foster care placements differently.  Studies indicate that
caseworkers generally provide less monitoring and assistance to
kinship care placements.  Some states have policies requiring less
frequent caseworker visitations to kinship care homes, although these
homes are more likely to be unlicensed.  For example, a 1992 HHS
study found that in 30 states, children may be placed in kinship care
homes whether or not the homes meet minimum standards designed to
ensure the safety and suitability of foster homes and foster parents. 
Mandatory orientation and training for foster parents are the most
frequently waived licensing requirements for kinship caregivers.  A
1994 Child Welfare League of America report on kinship care found few
studies that focused on either kinship care providers or the children
in their care.  These studies, which were limited in scope, provided
little information regarding the advantages of different types of
placement. 


--------------------
\9 We used only Los Angeles County and New York City data in our
analysis of county case file data regarding kinship and traditional
foster care placements.  Because the sample for Philadelphia County
contained only one child who was placed exclusively in kinship care,
we eliminated that location from this analysis. 

\10 This analysis excluded children who were at risk for serious
health problems and also had serious health conditions.  When these
children were included in the analysis, young children placed
exclusively in kinship care were about as likely as those placed
exclusively in traditional foster care to be at risk for future
problems as a result of prenatal drug exposure. 


      KINSHIP CARE INCREASED
      DRAMATICALLY
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1

Analysis of the California and New York state databases showed the
number of children of all ages in kinship care increased by over 350
percent between 1986 and 1991, and this percentage increase was even
higher for young foster children, at 379 percent.\11 (See fig.  4 and
table II.7 in app.  II.)

   Figure 4:  Increase in Kinship
   and Traditional Foster Care in
   California and New York Between
   1986 and 1991

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Note:  Counts represent all children in foster care at the end of the
calendar years. 

\a Part of the increase in kinship care placements is due to a
lawsuit filed in the New York Supreme Court, Eugene F.  v.  Gross,
which sought to require New York City to follow regulations to
formally include children who are placed with relatives in the foster
care caseload and make them eligible for services. 

Source:  State electronic databases. 

The dramatic increase of children in kinship care between 1986 and
1991 resulted in nearly equal numbers of placements in kinship and
traditional foster care in the three counties reviewed.  We estimated
that 49 percent of the young children had been placed in kinship care
at some time during the 1991 review period, while 53 percent had been
placed in traditional foster care.  (See table II.8 in app.  II.)

Some studies contend that the increase in kinship placements may have
been due, at least initially, to a shortage of traditional foster
homes.  Other studies posit that this increase may be the result of
state and county interpretations of the Adoption Assistance and Child
Welfare Act of 1980 as implying a preference for relative placements. 
In recognizing that foster care would continue to be a necessary
child welfare service, this act required states to place children in
the &quot;least restrictive (most family-like) setting available,&quot; which
has been interpreted by many states as implying a preference for
kinship care.  As of 1992, 44 states commonly placed foster children
in kinship care, and 29 states had policies in place requiring foster
care agencies to give preference to relatives of foster children.

   HEALTH-RELATED NEEDS OF FOSTER
   CHILDREN OFTEN GO UNMET DESPITE
   AGENCY EFFORTS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6

The foster care agencies reviewed struggle to ensure that the
health-related needs of children in their care are met.  About
one-third of all states, including the three reviewed, have
established only broad guidelines within which counties administer
foster care programs.  Thus, counties in these states develop and
implement programs with considerable autonomy, which results in a
variety of approaches being used. 

County foster care agencies in the locations reviewed have altered
their health-related policies, regulations, and programs in efforts
to improve the agencies' ability to meet the health needs of foster
children.  For example, one of the foster care agencies we reviewed
continues to develop and implement recordkeeping systems in an
attempt to improve its ability to ensure that foster children receive
needed services.  The agency is currently implementing its third
variation of a medical recordkeeping system in recent years. 
Implementation of the first two versions was unsuccessful, and the
third was too recently implemented for us to determine its success. 
However, because the third version is substantially similar to its
predecessors, its likelihood of success is limited. 

Other efforts by this agency have focused on establishing medical
clinics for foster children.  It established a comprehensive
assessment center at the county-run children's emergency shelter, but
that effort appears to have met with only limited success.  Medical
staff at the center told us that it is seldom used by foster children
of any age who reside outside the shelter.  The foster care agency is
also supporting the development of an ambitious and complex system of
multidisciplinary assessment and medical clinics for foster children. 
This most recent effort, while promising, depends on factors largely
outside the control of the foster care agency, such as the continuing
involvement of the academia-based physicians who proposed the system
and the viability of a complex design for funding services. 
Furthermore, the system needs strong support from within the agency
and procedures that direct foster children to the new system
if--unlike the current assessment center--it is to reach even a
sustainable level of utilization. 

Recognizing that states need assistance in improving their child
welfare programs, including foster care, ACF recently increased its
technical assistance efforts.  Within the past year, HHS contracted
for 10 National Resource Centers to assist ACF staff in responding to
states' questions and to provide free technical assistance to states. 
Each resource center specializes in a child welfare issue such as
permanency planning, abandoned infants, or special needs adoption. 
However, none of the resource centers is designated to help states
with ensuring health-related services for foster children. 

ACF also audits states to certify states' compliance with the
safeguards for foster children specified in the Social Security Act. 
However, the audits do not examine compliance with all safeguards. 
The safeguards include a requirement that case files of foster
children contain up-to-date health-related information, such as
records of immunizations and a child's health conditions.  We
previously reported that HHS did not audit states on their compliance
with all required safeguards for foster children, and we recommended
that it expand its audits to include all safeguards.\12

In March 1995, ACF officials confirmed that their audits still do not
examine whether states are complying with the health-related
safeguards.  An HHS determination that a state has passed its
compliance audit entitles the state to receive the full federal child
welfare funding available by law.  However, since HHS does not audit
for compliance with the health-related safeguards, states have no
federal financial incentive to comply with them.  ACF plans to
include these safeguards in future audits, according to the same
officials. 


--------------------
\12 Foster Care:  Incomplete Implementation of the Reforms and
Unknown Effectiveness (GAO/PEMD-89-17, Aug.  14, 1989). 


   CONCLUSIONS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7

Important health-related needs, including routine medical
examinations and various specialized services, remained unmet for
nearly one-third of the young foster children in the locations
reviewed.  Additionally, most young foster children in the locations
reviewed were at high risk for HIV as a result of parental drug
abuse, yet few children were actually tested for the infection. 
Furthermore, those in kinship care were less likely than those placed
in traditional foster care to receive needed health-related services. 

Despite federal safeguards for foster children, as well as
regulations of responsible agencies to ensure adequate health care
for foster children, agencies continue to struggle to meet the
complex health needs of young children.  Federal efforts to help
states design and implement effective foster care health programs
have been extremely limited, as evidenced by the lack of both ACF
audits and technical assistance to states on health-related issues. 
Our work confirms our earlier recommendation that ACF audits be
expanded to include all foster care safeguards.  We continue to
believe that ACF should take this action. 

Finally, foster care agencies have been slow to respond to one
critical health need--HIV risk assessment--which is the first step in
identifying HIV-infected children so that they can receive
appropriate and timely health care.  Yet, even if all foster children
were systematically assessed, HIV testing of high-risk children can
still be hampered by state laws and county policies.  Finally, while
we do not know why children in kinship care generally receive fewer
health-related services than children in traditional care, research
indicates that kinship caregivers receive less monitoring and
assistance from foster care agencies than traditional foster
caregivers. 

These findings are particularly disturbing given the vulnerable
nature of the population of young foster children.  Whether the
federal government retains the foster care program in its current
form or creates block grants to the states, these issues warrant
attention. 


   AGENCY COMMENTS AND OUR
   EVALUATION
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8

We provided HHS as well as the cognizant social services agencies of
the three states and locations reviewed with the opportunity to
comment on a draft of this report.  We received comments\13 from the
state of New York, New York City, and Los Angeles County. 
Philadelphia County responded that it could not comment on the
specifics of the report because of a pending lawsuit.  However, it
indicated a few general concerns.  We did not receive comments from
HHS, the state of California, or the state of Pennsylvania. 

One aspect of our report was commented on by three respondents.  New
York State, Los Angeles County, and Philadelphia County expressed
concern about the age of our data.  While our report is based on 1991
data, those were the most current data available when the study
began.  To ensure the continuing usefulness of the data and other
aspects of our study, we continued to monitor the locations reviewed
through spring 1995 to determine if any changes in policies and
programs had occurred that could substantially alter our conclusions. 
While some promising changes have occurred, either the locations that
provided comments to our draft provided us with no data to support
their assertions that the delivery of services has improved or it is
too early to determine the impact of the changes.  For example, New
York City commented that it is implementing a state early care
intervention program and has trained staff in the use of the program. 
However, it is too early to judge the impact of this new effort. 

Another aspect of our report was commented on by two respondents. 
New York State and Philadelphia County questioned the appropriateness
of combining the results of our analysis of cases across the three
locations reviewed.  As we stated in the report, we determined that
the conclusions drawn from our analysis were similar for each
location with two exceptions:  Philadelphia County was dropped from
analyses of kinship care, and data depicted in figure 2 included two
categories where the results varied widely by location.  With these
exceptions, the results were sufficiently consistent across all three
locations that we do not believe that presenting the aggregate
results unfairly portrays the situations in any of the locations. 


--------------------
\13 We received comments from the New York State Department of Social
Services, the New York City Human Resources Administration, the Los
Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, and the
Philadelphia Department of Human Services. 


      THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND
      NEW YORK CITY COMMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :8.1

The state of New York questioned the adequacy of the sample size.  We
arrived at our sample size using accepted statistical procedures that
gave us an adequate level of precision at the 95-percent confidence
level to support our findings.  Our detailed methodology is presented
in appendix I and the confidence intervals are presented in appendix
II. 

The state also expressed doubts about the accuracy of several of our
statistical findings, conveying its belief that an ongoing state
study regarding foster care medical services will produce different
results.  It believes that its ongoing study will produce a more
favorable picture of its ability to meet the needs of foster
children.  However, we cannot evaluate this opinion because the state
did not provide us with any results from this study.  Furthermore,
the state provided little information on the methodology being
employed, and we do not know whether the state plans to conduct such
analyses as would make it possible to compare their results with
ours. 

New York City raised different issues related to our methodology.  It
questioned whether inadequate caseworker recordkeeping provided an
incomplete depiction of the health-related services received by young
foster children.  Before beginning the case file review, to test the
feasibility of using this method, we reviewed the case files of a
small sample of children and then requested the foster care agencies
in the three locations reviewed to provide information on those same
children from all possible sources, including service providers and
foster parents.  In general, we found that the additional information
provided from these other sources did not change the conclusions we
had reached on the basis of our case file review regarding the level
of services these children received.  On this basis, we concluded
that the information in the case files would be sufficient for our
analytical purposes. 

New York State agrees with the importance of risk assessment for HIV
and agrees that it does not know the full extent of HIV-infected
children in foster care.  However, it disagrees that this occurs in
New York City because of a lack of a mechanism to carry out risk
assessments.  Furthermore, the state asserted that more children are
now being assessed and tested for HIV as a result of changes in its
policies.  We agree that this state has the most comprehensive
policies on risk assessment of the three locations reviewed.  For
this reason, we used a portion of their risk assessment policies as
criteria in one analysis.  However, the large gap we reported between
the number of children who were at risk for HIV, based on one New
York City risk criterion, and the number actually tested indicated
that the mechanisms in place did not ensure that their procedures
were consistently carried out.  While it is possible that recent
changes in New York State or New York City policies may have improved
the ability to identify HIV-infected children, state officials
pointed out that they have not been able to formally implement
regulations that would put their latest policy changes in place
because of a state moratorium on regulatory action. 

New York State agrees that children placed in kinship care were less
likely to receive services than children placed in traditional foster
care, and this finding was confirmed by the state's own study. 
However, it disagrees with the inclusion in the report of data on the
growth in kinship care because it asserts that such data do not
reflect the proportion of children actually in kinship care and
traditional foster care.  We agree that it is useful to understand
the proportion of children in different types of care, and this
information is included in the report.  However, we believe that
presenting data on the large growth in kinship care placements
between 1986 and 1991 is also useful to understand that the
utilization of kinship care has changed significantly since the
mid-1980s. 

New York State agrees with our conclusion that periodic reviews for
compliance with federal standards are appropriate.  It also made
technical comments on our characterizations of county versus state
regulations and of New York City as a county, and our description of
HIV testing policies.  On the basis of these comments, we modified
the report as appropriate. 


      LOS ANGELES COUNTY COMMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :8.2

Los Angeles County commented that its current internal audits of
medical assessments show that compliance is at approximately 90
percent.  We agree with that estimate of the receipt of required
medical examinations, which we refer to as routine care.  As stated
in our report, about 12 percent of young foster children did not
receive any routine health care; Los Angeles County's current
estimate of 10-percent noncompliance with its regulations regarding
medical assessments falls within our 95-percent confidence interval
cited in appendix II. 

Los Angeles County also commented that it has made a number of
changes over the last few years that were designed to meet the health
care needs of foster children.  Specifically, it discussed the HIV
risk assessment policy, the comprehensive multidisciplinary
assessment center it established at a children's emergency shelter,
and the new system of multidisciplinary assessment and medical
clinics.  We acknowledge that Los Angeles County has a policy of
evaluation for risk of exposure to HIV as an ongoing process for all
foster children.  However, in September 1994, numerous county program
officials told us that the county has no procedures to systematically
ensure that risk assessments take place; consequently, this policy
does not ensure that foster children who are at high risk for HIV
will be identified and tested.  In addition, in fall 1994, we visited
the assessment center at the children's emergency shelter and
interviewed key program officials and medical staff.  We acknowledge
that this assessment center was designed to provide a variety of
comprehensive health-related evaluations.  However, as stated in our
report, this assessment center is little used by foster children who
reside outside the emergency shelter.  Finally, as we stated in our
report, we agree that the multidisciplinary medical clinics are a
promising approach to meeting the complex health-related needs of
young foster children.  However, it was not until September 1994 that
the first of the seven planned assessment center clinics was funded
to hire staff; thus, this system is in its infancy and is
substantially untested.

SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
=========================================================== Appendix I

To accomplish the objectives of our review, we obtained and analyzed
data on state foster care programs and the children in them from the
three states with the largest average monthly foster care populations
in 1991--California, New York, and Pennsylvania.  Over 50 percent of
the nation's foster children are under the jurisdiction of these
three states. 

We used a variety of approaches to meet our objectives.  We analyzed
electronic state and county foster care databases; conducted a case
file review based on generalizable random samples; interviewed HHS,
state, and county foster care officials; conducted a telephone survey
of child welfare advocacy groups and other child welfare experts;
conducted group interviews with foster parents and caseworkers;
reviewed foster care and related literature; reviewed applicable
portions of the Social Security Act and other legislation; and
reviewed foster care agency regulations and other documents.  Studies
cited in this report are listed in the bibliography. 


   STATEWIDE DATA
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1

To determine the number of foster children in different types of
placements in the states, we analyzed electronic foster care
databases for the two states where they were available, California
and New York.  State officials provided us with automated records for
all children who were in foster care at any time during calendar
years 1986 and 1991.  We could not obtain comparable electronic
records for Pennsylvania as that state has not established an
automated case record system.\14


--------------------
\14 For the three states reviewed, the 110-percent increase in young
foster children that was previously reported combines data from
electronic databases and aggregate state data.  For California and
New York, states with electronic databases, the counts are for foster
children under the age of 3 years.  For Pennsylvania, the count is
for foster children under the age of 5 years, as that state's
aggregate data did not break out children under age 3 years. 


   COUNTY CASE FILE DATA
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2

To determine the health-related services needed and received by young
foster children, their health conditions, and the types of placements
they were in, we reviewed statistically representative samples of
foster care case files for the county with the largest foster care
population in 1991 for each of the states reviewed:  Los Angeles
County, New York City,\15 and Philadelphia County.  To identify those
locations, we again used the state foster care databases for
California and New York; for Pennsylvania, we relied on information
provided by state officials.  Philadelphia County officials provided
us with an electronic database of the records for foster children in
that county in 1991. 

Before drawing the sample, we narrowed the databases to include only
foster children whose third birthday occurred no later than December
31, 1991.  This resulted in population sizes of 8,249 for Los Angeles
County, 13,171 for New York City, and 1,335 for Philadelphia County. 
Then we selected random samples from each of these locations
resulting in a total sample of 414 children.  The population sizes
and initial sample sizes are shown in table I.1.

----------------------------------------------------------
\a Percentage total is a weighted average showing the percentage of
the total population covered by the final samples. 

We requested all foster care case files for each child in the sample. 
A few cases were dropped from the sample because the children did not
meet the criterion of being in foster care during the review year or
were not of the appropriate age.  Other cases were dropped because
county officials could not locate the records.  Finally, we dropped
cases of children who were in foster care during our review period
for less than 30 days in Los Angeles County and New York City, and
less than 60 days in Philadelphia County.  We did this to eliminate
cases in which a child's tenure in foster care was shorter than the
time foster care agencies were allowed, by their local regulations,
to complete initial medical examinations.  This resulted in final
samples totaling 360 young foster children in our three locations. 

We examined the foster care case files for the period covering a
child's first entry into foster care until the end of the review year
or until the child was discharged from foster care, whichever
occurred earlier.  We used an automated data collection instrument to
record information from the case files.  The recorded information was
reviewed for accuracy by the individual preparing it before
finalizing each electronic record.  We also reviewed the case file
data for consistent coding among individuals; minor adjustments were
made to the coding as a result of that review. 

We analyzed the case file data using univariate and bivariate
analyses, descriptive statistical methods.  We found that for some of
the data, the results varied among the three locations; however, the
conclusions we drew from the analyses of each location were similar. 
Thus, the locations could be combined for analysis.  Finally, when
combining these data, we weighted them to adjust for disproportionate
sampling and produced aggregate estimates.  However, the results
pertain to only the three locations combined and do not necessarily
reflect populations of foster children at the state or national
level. 

For data derived from the case file review, the percentage estimates
reported in the letter and the numerical estimates reported in
appendix II are point estimates.  Because the estimates are based on
combined results from three samples, each is subject to sampling
error.  The size of the sampling error reflects the precision of the
estimate; the smaller the error, the more precise the estimate. 
Sampling errors for the estimates were calculated at the 95-percent
confidence level except where noted.  We are 95-percent confident
that the actual percentages fall within the confidence intervals
reported in appendix II.  In other words, there is a 5-percent chance
that the confidence intervals do not contain the actual population
percentages.

database as a county. 


      ANALYSIS OF PLACEMENT TYPE
      AND SERVICE DELIVERY
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.1

For the analysis comparing the subpopulations of children in kinship
and traditional foster care, we used only records of children who had
been placed exclusively in kinship care or exclusively in traditional
foster care.  Furthermore, because the sample for Philadelphia County
contained only one child who was placed exclusively in kinship care,
we eliminated that location from this analysis.  The subpopulation
sizes are shown in table I.2.

This is the second report responding to this request.  We conducted
our review for both reports between November 1992 and March 1995 in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  We
analyzed the electronic databases as provided to us by state and
county officials, and we performed limited tests of the completeness
of the case files. 


ANALYSIS RESULTS
========================================================== Appendix II

This appendix presents the numerical values for the data discussed in
the body of this report.  Where appropriate, point estimates and
confidence intervals are provided.  The appendix includes case file
review results for the review year 1991 and statewide data for

\a We dropped cases for children who were in foster care during our
review period for less than 30 days in Los Angeles County and New
York City, and less than 60 days in Philadelphia County.  We did this
to eliminate cases in which a child's tenure in foster care was
shorter than the time foster care agencies are allowed, by their
local regulations, to complete initial medical examinations. 

\b Children are exempt from initial examination requirements if they
received an equivalent examination within 90 days before entering
foster care.  Of children who received no routine care during our
review period, three were required, because of their age at entry and
length of stay, to have an initial examination if they did not have
an examination 90 days before entering foster care.  We believe,
based on the case file data, that these children did not meet the
prior examination requirement. 

\c Includes children who received at least one immunization and
excludes children who were under 90 days of age.

Note:  We calculated these rates from data supplied by CDC from its
study of blind HIV testing of newborns.  Forty-four states and the
District of Columbia participated in this study.  The six states that
did not participate were Idaho, Indiana, Nebraska, North Dakota,
South Dakota, and Vermont.  While the District of Columbia was the
only nonstate location included in this comparison of estimated
HIV-infected newborns, it ranked first. 

\a Reflects the estimates of children who are HIV-infected, excluding
those who falsely test positive at birth.  CDC's estimates of the
number of HIV-infected newborns are based on a 25-percent
transmission rate; in other words, one-quarter of the number of
newborns who test HIV-positive at birth are estimated to be
HIV-infected rather than merely carrying their HIV-infected mothers'
antibodies.

which sought to require New York City to follow regulations to
formally include children who are placed with relatives in the foster
care caseload and make them eligible for services.

<font size="2">Despite law enforcement efforts, the flow of drugs along the southwest
border continues, and unless border control efforts become more
effective, illegal immigration is expected to increase during the next
decade. A 1993 study commissioned by the Office of National Drug Control
Policy recommended that the Border Patrol try to prevent illegal alien
entry rather than catch illegal aliens once they have entered the
country. The study suggested using (1) multiple physical barriers in
some areas to prevent entry and (2) more highway checkpoints and other
measures to prevent drugs and illegal aliens that have entered the
United States from leaving border areas. Officials GAO spoke with
expressed support for a &quot;prevention strategy,&quot; and preliminary results
from recent prevention initiatives in San Diego and El Paso are
generally encouraging. However, some drug smuggling and illegal
immigration seem to have been rerouted from these two sectors to other
southwest border areas where enforcement is less effective. In August
1994, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) approved a
national strategy to prevent illegal entry that builds on the agency's
success in San Diego and El Paso. Although this plan appears
encouraging, GAO concludes that it is too early to tell what impact it
will eventually have on drug smuggling and illegal immigration along the
southwest border.

December 29, 1994

The Honorable Gary A.  Condit
Chairman, Subcommittee on Information, Justice,
 Transportation and Agriculture
Committee on Government Operations
House of Representatives

Dear Mr.  Chairman: 

This report responds to your request concerning the adequacy of
United States efforts to secure the southwest border.  Specifically,
you asked us to (1) determine the extent of the threat from drug
smuggling and illegal immigration and (2) identify ways to enhance
security between the ports of entry. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

Although the full extent of drug smuggling and illegal immigration is
unknown, both pose a serious threat along the southwest border. 
Experts estimate that most of the cocaine and most of the illegal
aliens entering the United States enter from Mexico across the
southwest border.  Despite law enforcement efforts, the flow of drugs
continues, and unless border control efforts become more effective,
illegal immigration is expected to increase over the next decade. 

A 1993 study commissioned by the Office of National Drug Control
Policy (ONDCP) identified ways to enhance security along the
southwest border between the ports of entry.  The study recommended
that the Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS) Border Patrol
focus on preventing illegal alien entry instead of on apprehending
aliens once they have entered the country.  To implement this
strategy, the study recommended using (1) multiple physical barriers
in certain areas to prevent entry and (2) additional highway
checkpoints and other measures to prevent drugs and illegal aliens
that succeeded in entering the United States from leaving border
areas.  Previous studies have made similar recommendations. 

There was widespread support for a &quot;prevention strategy&quot; among the
officials with whom we spoke, and preliminary results from recent
prevention initiatives in two Border Patrol sectors--San Diego, CA,
and El Paso, TX--are generally encouraging.  However, some drug
smuggling and illegal immigration seems to have been rerouted from
these two sectors to other southwest border areas where enforcement
is less effective. 

In August 1994, the INS Commissioner approved a national Border
Patrol strategic plan that focuses on preventing illegal entry.  INS'
national strategy builds on the success its San Diego and El Paso
sectors have reportedly had in reducing illegal entry.  INS plans to
implement its strategy in phases over several years, concentrating
initially in the two areas traditionally having the greatest illegal
activity--San Diego and El Paso.  The strategy contains various
indicators with which INS plans to measure the success of its
efforts. 

On the basis of the initial positive results in San Diego and El
Paso, INS' national strategy appears encouraging.  However, since it
will take several years to implement the strategy, it is too early to
tell what impact it will eventually have on drug smuggling and
illegal immigration along the southwest border. 


   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

Within INS, the Border Patrol is the agency responsible for securing
the border between the ports of entry.  The Border Patrol's mission
is to maintain control of the international boundaries between the
ports of entry by detecting and preventing smuggling and illegal
entry of aliens into the United States.  In addition, in 1991, ONDCP
designated the Border Patrol the primary agency for narcotics
interdiction between the ports of entry. 

To accomplish its mission, the Border Patrol (1) patrols the
international boundaries and (2) inspects passengers and vehicles at
checkpoints located along highways leading from border areas, at bus
and rail stations, and at air terminals.  The Border Patrol uses
vehicles and aircraft to patrol areas between the ports of entry and
electronic equipment, such as sensors and low-light-level
televisions, to detect illegal entry into the country.  The Border
Patrol carries out its mission in 21 sectors.  Nine of these sectors
are located along the southwest border with Mexico.\1 As of September
30, 1994, about 3,747 agents were assigned to the 9 sectors,
representing 88 percent of Border Patrol agents nationwide. 

The following other federal entities support land border control
efforts between the ports of entry along the southwest border. 

El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC), the nation's principal tactical
drug intelligence facility, prepares assessments on the threat of
drug smuggling. 

Operation Alliance prepares border control strategies and coordinates
drug enforcement activities of 17 federal and numerous state and
local law enforcement agencies combating drug smuggling. 

Joint Task Force Six (JTF-6), located in El Paso, coordinates
military support for drug enforcement efforts. 

In September 1991, ONDCP tasked Sandia National Laboratories, through
INS, to do a &quot;systematic analysis of the security along the United
States/Mexico Border between the ports of entry and to recommend
measures by which control of the border could be improved.&quot; ONDCP
chose Sandia because of its expertise in designing physical security
systems.  In January 1993, Sandia issued its report entitled
Systematic Analysis of the Southwest Border.  We refer to this as the
Sandia study throughout our report.  According to the study, to
conduct its analysis, Sandia personnel visited all nine Border Patrol
southwest border sectors, toured various Border Patrol facilities,
and interviewed both chief patrol agents and Border Patrol agents. 
They viewed much of the southwest border from either the ground or
the air and reviewed a number of previous studies related to border
control. 


--------------------
\1 These nine sectors are located in San Diego and El Centro, CA;
Yuma and Tucson, AZ; and El Paso, Del Rio, Marfa, Laredo, and
McAllen, TX. 


   OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND
   METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

In addressing our objectives to (1) determine the extent of the
threat from drug smuggling and illegal immigration and (2) identify
ways to enhance security between the ports of entry, we

interviewed intelligence officials responsible for determining the
threat from drug smuggling and illegal immigration and reviewed
related documentation;

reviewed the Sandia study and discussed the study's findings with its
authors and various INS officials responsible for border control;

reviewed EPIC, Department of State, and Operation Alliance reports to
determine the threat from drug smuggling;

visited the San Diego and El Paso Border Patrol sectors and discussed
with sector officials their recent border control initiatives;

analyzed INS data from its management information systems related to
apprehensions and narcotics seizures to obtain additional information
on the threat from drug smuggling and illegal immigration along the
southwest border; and

interviewed INS headquarters officials to determine plans for
improving border security. 

As agreed with the Subcommittee, our focus was control of the land
border between the ports of entry.  We did not evaluate border
control activities at the ports of entry or efforts related to
smuggling by air and sea.  We did not verify the accuracy and
completeness of the data we obtained from INS' management information
systems. 

We did our work between October 1993 and September 1994 in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards.  We discussed
the results of our work with the Acting Chief of the Border Patrol
and other INS officials.  Their comments are presented on page 27. 


   DRUG SMUGGLING AND ILLEGAL
   IMMIGRATION ARE SERIOUS THREATS
   ALONG THE SOUTHWEST BORDER
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4


      DRUG SMUGGLING
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1

Although the full extent is unknown, drug smuggling is a serious
threat along the southwest border.  The Department of State's 1993
International Narcotics Control Strategy Report indicated that Mexico
is a transit country for South American cocaine destined for the
United States and a major country of origin for heroin and marijuana. 
According to the report, between 50 and 70 percent of the cocaine
smuggled into the United States transited Mexico, entering primarily
by land across the southwest border.  In addition, about 23 percent
of the heroin smuggled into the United States originated in Mexico. 

INS data showed that Border Patrol narcotics seizures along the
southwest border have risen over the last few years.  Between fiscal
years 1990 and 1993, the number of Border Patrol narcotics seizures
rose from around 4,200 to around 6,400, an increase of about 50
percent.  The amount of cocaine seized nearly doubled from about
14,000 pounds in 1990 to about 27,000 pounds in 1993. 

According to a June 1992 Operation Alliance report,\2 the primary
smuggling route across the southwest border was by land.  The report
pointed out that although cocaine was the primary drug threat,
followed by marijuana, the heroin threat was growing.  The report
stated that in spite of law enforcement agencies' efforts to counter
drug smuggling, the flow of drugs between the ports of entry along
the southwest border continued due to vast open areas and a
relatively low law enforcement presence.  The report concluded that
&quot;our successes are insignificant when compared to the threat.  Our
collective efforts are currently only a minor irritant to the
smugglers.&quot;

The Sandia study deemed drug smuggling a serious threat all along the
southwest border.  For example, the study deemed drug smuggling a
serious threat in south Texas and the southern Arizona border area,
which is dubbed &quot;Cocaine Alley.&quot; Figure 1 shows the seizure of over
1,000 pounds of cocaine by Border Patrol agents in San Diego.  Figure
2 shows a panel truck stopped by El Paso Border Patrol agents (see
fig.  2A), with narcotics hidden in its interior panels (see fig. 
2B).  Agents seized nearly 250 pounds of marijuana (see fig.  2C).

      ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.2

Illegal immigration is also a serious threat to the United States. 
In 1993, we estimated that the total inflow of illegal aliens into
this country in 1988 ranged from 1.3 million to 3.9 million.\3 The
major component of the inflow, 1.2 million to 3.2 million, was
Mexicans crossing the southwest border, with most entering between
the ports of entry.  Much of the inflow represented short-term visits
to the United States. 

In June 1994, INS estimated there were about 3.8 million undocumented
migrants residing in the United States.  About half of the unlawful
residents entered unlawfully across the borders, while the other half
entered as visitors but did not leave.  The estimates were based on
an analysis of INS and Bureau of the Census data and, according to
INS, experts have embraced these estimates as the best available. 

The 1993 Sandia study characterized the southwest border as &quot;being
overrun.&quot; For example, in the San Diego sector, the study noted that
as many as 6,000 aliens attempted to enter the United States
illegally every night along the first 7-1/2 miles of border beginning
at the Pacific Ocean.  One of the reasons given in the study for this
situation was that most of the border fencing in the San Diego sector
and other urban areas was &quot;poorly maintained&quot; and &quot;totally
ineffective&quot; (see fig.  3).  However, as discussed on page 15, INS
recently completed a new fence in the San Diego sector and plans
additional fencing in other sectors. 



(See figure in printed edition.)Figure 3:  Ineffective Fencing in the
San Diego Sector Before Recent Border Patrol Initiatives

Source:  Border Patrol. 

Border Patrol apprehensions along the southwest border declined
between 1986 and 1989 but, although still below the 1986 level,
apprehensions have gradually risen since then (see fig.  4).  Figure
5 illustrates the prominence of the San Diego and El Paso sectors as
border-crossing locations.  In fiscal year 1993, these two sectors
accounted for two-thirds of the 1.2 million southwest border
apprehensions.

   Apprehensions Rising Since 1989

   edition.)

   Figure 5:  Most 1993 Southwest
   Border Apprehensions Occurred

   Sectors

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Source:  Border Patrol data. 

Although the southwest border is approximately 1,600 miles long, much
of it is difficult to cross by foot or vehicle due to rugged terrain,
desert, or natural barriers such as some portions of the Rio Grande
River.  Our analysis of INS data showed that in fiscal year 1992 over
half of all southwest border apprehensions occurred along only 18 of
the 1,600 border miles--13 miles along the border between San Diego
and Tijuana, Mexico, and 5 miles along the border between El Paso and
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.  However, as we discussed on pages 23 to 25,
recent border control initiatives in San Diego and El Paso appear to
have rerouted some illegal immigrants to other southwest border
areas. 

Unless border control efforts become more effective, illegal
immigration is expected to increase.  In September 1993, we reported
that the flow of illegal aliens across the southwest border is
expected to increase during the next decade because Mexico's economy
is unlikely to absorb all of the new job seekers that are expected to
enter the labor force.\4

make a reliable estimate.

   SANDIA STUDY RECOMMENDED
   CHANGING BORDER CONTROL TACTICS
   FROM APPREHENDING ALIENS TO
   PREVENTING ILLEGAL ENTRY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

The Border Patrol's traditional tactic of discouraging illegal entry
has been to apprehend aliens once they have entered the United
States.  According to the Sandia study's authors, this tactic was
inefficient and diminished the Border Patrol's ability to control the
border.  In addition, the authors said the only good border control
strategy is one that prevents people from crossing the border.  The
study concluded that the way to prevent illegal entry is to impose
&quot;effective barriers on the free flow of traffic.&quot; The study noted
that where it is not possible or practical to keep drugs and illegal
aliens from entering the United States, they should be stopped at the
earliest opportunity.  In addition, the Sandia study concluded that
&quot;control of the illegal alien and drug traffic can be gained&quot; and
recommended that the Border Patrol change its tactics from
apprehending illegal aliens after they have entered the United States
to preventing illegal entry into the United States. 


      USE MULTIPLE BARRIERS AND
      MORE CHECKPOINTS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1

A goal of a &quot;prevention&quot; strategy would be to significantly increase
the difficulty of crossing the border illegally.  The Sandia study
concluded that single barriers, which had been used thus far, had not
proven effective in preventing either drugs or illegal aliens from
entering the country.  Consequently, the study recommended (1)
multiple lighted barriers in urban border areas to prevent the entry
of large volumes of drugs and illegal aliens, with patrol roads
between the barriers and (2) enhanced checkpoint operations to
prevent those drugs and illegal aliens that succeeded in crossing the
border from leaving the border area.  (See fig.  6 for an artist's
illustration of the Sandia study's proposed three-fence barrier
system.)

   Figure 6:  Artist's
   Illustration of the Three-Fence
   Barrier System

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

   Source:  January 1993 Sandia
   National Laboratories' study.

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

According to the Sandia study, multiple barriers in urban areas would
provide the Border Patrol a greater ability to (1) discourage a
significant number of illegal border crossers, (2) detect intruders
early and delay them as long as possible, and (3) channel a
significantly reduced level of traffic to places where border patrol
agents can adequately deal with it.  The Sandia study recommended
multiple barriers along approximately 90 miles, or less than 6
percent of the southwest border. 

Because of rugged terrain, segments of the southwest border cannot be
controlled at the immediate border.  The alternative the Sandia study
recommended for these areas is to use highway checkpoints to contain
those aliens who cross the border illegally.  The study recommended
more checkpoints be established and that all operate full time.  The
Border Patrol's use of part-time checkpoints allows violators to
cross unobserved after the checkpoint is closed. 

Except for the proposed multiple-fence system, many of the Sandia
study's recommendations were not new and, according to Border Patrol
officials, had been made previously by their own personnel.  For
example, a January 1989 study recommended many of the same measures
such as barriers, checkpoints, and enhanced electronic surveillance
equipment.  The study was conducted by a retired head of the Border
Patrol for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\5

Immigration Reform, January 1989, Washington, D.C. 


   RESOURCES REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT
   SANDIA STUDY'S RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6

The Sandia study estimated it would initially cost an additional $260
million to implement its recommendations with annual recurring costs
of about $69 million.  Most of the initial costs are associated with
physical barriers and checkpoints. 

Ultimately, implementing the Sandia study's recommendations may
require only a slightly larger Border Patrol force.  According to the
study, as physical barriers and checkpoints were completed, the
number of Border Patrol agents required would increase.  However, the
study noted that as control was gained at the border, the number of
agents could be allowed to decrease to a number not significantly
larger than the 3,640 agents that were deployed along the southwest
border when the study began in December 1991. 


   PREVENTION STRATEGY HAS
   WIDESPREAD SUPPORT
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7

The Border Patrol officials we spoke with (including the acting
chief, acting deputy chief, San Diego and El Paso chief patrol
agents, and a regional Border Patrol official) all agreed with the
Sandia study's conclusion that the Border Patrol should focus on
preventing illegal entry rather than on apprehending illegal aliens. 
In addition, officials of EPIC, Operation Alliance, JTF-6, and the
mayor and police officials of El Paso support the concept of trying
to prevent entry rather than apprehending aliens. 

This strategy is also in line with our past positions on controlling
illegal immigration.  In June 1993, we testified before the House
Subcommittee on International Law, Immigration and Refugees,
Committee on the Judiciary, that &quot;the key to controlling the illegal
entry of aliens is to prevent their initial arrival.&quot;\6

Illegal Aliens (GAO/T-GGD-93-39, June 30, 1993). 


   RECENT SAN DIEGO AND EL PASO
   BORDER PATROL INITIATIVES ARE
   CONSISTENT WITH SANDIA STUDY'S
   FINDINGS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8

Major Border Patrol initiatives in the San Diego and El Paso sectors
are consistent with the Sandia study's findings.  Both sectors have
begun initiatives that focus on preventing illegal entry rather than
on apprehending aliens. 


      SAN DIEGO SECTOR ERECTED
      PHYSICAL BARRIERS AND
      LIGHTING
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :8.1

In 1990, the San Diego sector's chief patrol agent began an
initiative to erect physical barriers, primarily to deter drug
smuggling.  With the assistance of JTF-6, the San Diego sector
installed 10-foot welded steel fencing along approximately 14 miles
of border where sector officials believed the majority of drugs and
illegal aliens crossed within the sector.  The new fence, completed
in late 1993, is substantially stronger than previous chain link
fencing.  JTF-6 is also installing high-intensity lights and a second
and third fence at strategic locations along the same 14 miles.  As
of February 1994, JTF-6 had installed lights along about 4-1/2 of the
13 miles. 

The Sandia study recommended similar measures.  For example, the
study recommended that the sector erect multiple lighted physical
barriers along the same stretch of border where the sector erected
its new fence. 


      EL PASO SECTOR INITIATED
      &quot;OPERATION HOLD-THE-LINE&quot;
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :8.2

Before September 1993, like San Diego, the El Paso sector's strategy
emphasized apprehending aliens rather than preventing illegal entry. 
However, as apprehensions increased so did the opportunities for
confrontation between illegal aliens and El Paso Border Patrol
agents.  These increased opportunities for confrontation led to
allegations of abuse against agents.  Under the sector's apprehension
strategy, El Paso's chief patrol agent told us that the border area
was in &quot;complete chaos.&quot; The chief estimated there were up to 8,000
to 10,000 illegal border crossings daily, and only 1 out of 8 aliens
was apprehended. 

The apprehension strategy also created several problems in the
community. 

El Paso citizens and others complained about this approach in
meetings with the sector's chief patrol agent.  They believed that
the Border Patrol did not try to prevent entry but, in fact, used the
increased numbers of apprehensions as a primary factor in justifying
its budget. 

Some local residents felt their civil rights were being violated by
the Border Patrol.  For example, students and teachers at a local
high school filed a federal lawsuit to stop harassment after El Paso
sector agents confronted a coach believing he was an alien
smuggler.\7

Illegal aliens also had a significant impact on the city's crime
rates.  El Paso police officials estimated that undocumented aliens
committed 75 to 80 percent of all auto thefts, as well as many
burglaries.  The Mayor of El Paso told us that illegal immigration
costs the city about $30 to $50 million per year. 

In light of these problems, El Paso's chief patrol agent began an
initiative in September 1993 to change the sector's border control
strategy to one of preventing illegal entry.  The sector stationed
all available agents immediately at a 20-mile stretch of the border
in highly visible Border Patrol vehicles.  The primary goal of the
new strategy--Operation Hold-the-Line--was preventing significant
numbers of aliens from entering the El Paso metropolitan area.\8
Those who still tried to cross the border illegally were routed to
less populated areas where they could be more easily apprehended. 

The El Paso sector's goal of preventing illegal entry is similar to
the one recommended by the Sandia study, although the tactics are
different.  Sandia recommended multiple physical barriers to prevent
entry; the sector employs agents as a human barrier.  However, the
sector eventually plans to construct additional lighted fencing,
which is generally consistent with the Sandia study recommendations. 


--------------------
\7 The parties eventually reached an out-of-court settlement. 

\8 Operation Hold-the-Line was initially called &quot;Operation Blockade.&quot;


   PREVENTION STRATEGY APPEARS
   ENCOURAGING
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :9

Preliminary results in San Diego and El Paso suggest that the
prevention strategy has reduced illegal entry in these sectors. 
Other benefits include less border crime, less confrontation between
Border Patrol agents and illegal aliens, and strong public support. 


      SAN DIEGO SECTOR
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :9.1

Although the San Diego sector's border control initiative has not
been fully implemented, indications are that the new tactics are
reducing the number of aliens crossing the border illegally in the
San Diego area.  As shown in figure 7, sector apprehensions were down
20 percent in fiscal year 1994 compared to 1992 and dropped below
1990 levels, the year the sector began implementing its new border
control tactics.  Apprehensions decreased even though the sector
increased the amount of time spent on border enforcement nearly 41
percent between 1990 and 1994.

   Fiscal Year 1994 Border
   Apprehensions Are Down From
   Previous Years

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Source:  Border Patrol data. 

Also, apprehensions at highway checkpoints away from the border
declined 24 percent between fiscal years 1990 and 1993 even though
the amount of time spent performing traffic checks increased 22

During our review, we toured the most heavily trafficked portion of
the San Diego sector border and found visible evidence of the new
tactics'

on Illegal Border Crossings in San Diego Sector

effect on illegal border crossing.  As figure 8A shows, before the
new border control tactics, hundreds of aliens would line up along
the U.S.  side of the border during daylight hours, waiting for an
opportunity to go northward.  However, as illustrated in figure 8B,
after the new border patrol tactics were initiated, large groups of
aliens no longer waited to cross during the day, which according to a
Border Patrol official is typical. 

Also, as shown in figure 8C, formerly there were large gaps in border
fencing allowing aliens to easily cross the border.  However, figure
8D shows that these gaps in the fencing have now been closed.

In addition, according to San Diego sector officials, violent crime
and confrontations between Border Patrol agents and illegal aliens
have been reduced because the fencing has prevented large groups of
aliens from gathering.  For example, murders in the border areas
adjacent to the fencing dropped from nine in 1990 to none between
1991 and June 1994.  According to the sector's chief patrol agent, as
of February 1994, there had not been any incidents during the last 2
years where San Diego Border Patrol agents had used deadly force
against illegal aliens.  Also, reported incidents of assaults, rapes,
and robberies in this area have declined. 


      EL PASO SECTOR
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :9.2

El Paso sector officials cited several indications that the sector's
new prevention strategy is working.  For example, according to the
Border Patrol, the number of aliens attempting to illegally cross the
border through the El Paso sector has decreased significantly. 
According to the chief patrol agent, before Operation Hold-the-Line,
there were up to 10,000 illegal border crossings daily.  In February
1994, the sector estimated that only about 500 people a day were
illegally crossing the border.  A March 1994 sector intelligence
report indicated the new strategy had deterred many aliens in
Mexico's interior from coming to the El Paso border area. 

There has been a sharp drop in El Paso sector apprehensions since
implementation of its new strategy.  As figure 9 shows, the El Paso
sector's illegal alien apprehensions in fiscal year 1994 were down 72
percent compared to fiscal year 1993.  Two factors influencing this
decrease are the deterrent effect of the new border control strategy
and, as discussed on pages 23 to 25, the rerouting of some illegal
aliens to other southwest border areas.

   Apprehensions Are Down Sharply
   From Previous Years

   edition.)

According to sector officials, many illegal border crossers try to
leave El Paso via the airport.  With the implementation of the
prevention strategy in the El Paso sector, the number of
apprehensions made at El Paso's International Airport was
significantly reduced, indicating that fewer aliens are crossing the
border illegally in El Paso.  According to INS data, in fiscal year
1993, the sector averaged about 3,700 apprehensions a month at the
airport.  As of June 1994, the sector was averaging about 700
apprehensions a month, an 81-percent decrease. 

The El Paso public strongly supports the sector's new strategy.  A
poll taken in February 1994 showed 84 percent in favor of the
sector's strategy.\9 Complaints against the Border Patrol from both
local residents and illegal aliens have decreased since the start of
Operation Hold-the-Line.  According to sector officials, only one
allegation of abuse was made in the first 5 months of the operation. 
Although they did not have any specific data, local police officials
said complaints to the police department of harassment by Border
Patrol officers are &quot;way down.&quot;

Police officials also attribute a drop in certain crimes to Operation
Hold-the-Line.  For example, there were nearly one-third fewer
burglaries and one-fourth fewer motor vehicle thefts in the 3 months
after the operation began in September 1993 than in the same 3 months
in 1992. 

Two studies also concluded that Operation Hold-the-Line has been
successful in deterring illegal immigration in El Paso.\10 A December
1993 study of Operation Hold-the-Line by the Center for Immigration
Studies concluded that the operation &quot;has proven to be successful&quot;
and the new preventative deployment was &quot;both more humane and more
effective.&quot; According to this study, the operation represented a
viable long-term approach to more successful border control.  A July
1994 study requested by the U.S.  Commission on Immigration Reform
found that the operation significantly reduced illegal crossings and
had resulted in less crime and fewer allegations against Border
Patrol agents in El Paso.  In addition, the study found that the
strategy has broad public support.  However, the study also found
that the redeployment of agents and longer work shifts have eroded
morale among agents, and the strategy is labor-intensive.  Any
expansion without additional agents would stretch present resources. 

Although successful in significantly reducing illegal entry into El
Paso, according to sector officials, the new strategy weakened some
sector operations.  For example, the El Paso sector took important
resources from checkpoint operations resulting in some checkpoints
being closed over 50 percent of the time.  The Sandia study, however,
recommended that El Paso increase the number of checkpoints and
operate all checkpoints 24 hours a day.

   SAN DIEGO AND EL PASO SECTORS'
   INITIATIVES HAVE REROUTED DRUGS
   AND ALIENS TO OTHER SOUTHWEST
   BORDER AREAS
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :10

The San Diego and El Paso sectors' initiatives appear to have
rerouted drugs and illegal aliens to other parts of the southwest
border.  For example, the July 1994 study of Operation Hold-the- Line
found that the operation had less of an effect on those illegal
aliens headed for the interior of the United States.  These aliens
apparently adapted to the prevention strategy by finding new routes
into the United States. 

In addition, interviews with apprehended illegal aliens have revealed
that smugglers are now telling those traveling from the interior of
Mexico that it is easier to cross into Nogales, AZ, rather than into
San Diego or El Paso, according to Tucson's Deputy Chief Patrol
Agent.  In addition, according to the deputy, some smugglers are
reported to be moving their operations from San Diego to Nogales. 

A comparison of Tucson and El Paso sector apprehensions appears to
support the premise that the recent San Diego and El Paso initiatives
have increased illegal entry through other southwest border sectors. 
As figure 10 shows, since the start of the initiative in the El Paso
sector, Tucson sector apprehensions have increased about 50 percent
(about 93,000 in fiscal year 1993 compared to 139,000 in fiscal year
1994).  El Paso apprehensions, on the other hand, dropped 72 percent
(about 286,000 to about 80,000 over the same period).

   Apprehensions Have Increased as

   edition.)

Another indication that illegal alien entry may be moving to other
sectors is that while the San Diego sector's fiscal year 1993
apprehensions were 6 percent lower than fiscal year 1992,
apprehensions in the remaining southwest border sectors increased
about 17 percent (see fig.  11).

   While Other Southwest Border
   Sectors' Have Increased

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Drug trafficking has also apparently been affected.  According to
EPIC's December 1993 Monthly Threat Brief, El Paso's Operation
Hold-the-Line has lead to changes in smuggling methods.  Instead of
fording the Rio Grande River, some smugglers have attempted to move
drugs through ports of entry and to areas east and west of El Paso,
around the sector's 20-mile line of agents. 

According to a San Diego sector official, the new fence has virtually
eliminated the number of drug and alien smugglers driving across the
border in the San Diego area.  However, the sector has noticed an
increase in drug smuggling in the mountainous areas east of San
Diego.  In addition, the amount of cocaine seized in the El Centro
sector, the sector adjacent to San Diego, increased dramatically from
698 pounds in fiscal year 1991 to nearly 18,000 pounds in fiscal year
1993. 


   INS' NATIONAL BORDER CONTROL
   STRATEGY
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :11

In August 1994, the INS Commissioner approved a national Border
Patrol strategic plan for gaining control of the nation's borders. 
The strategy focuses on preventing illegal entry and builds on the
success INS has reportedly had in San Diego and El Paso.  INS plans
to put more agents along the border and use more lighting, fencing,
and other barriers.  On the basis of the national border control
strategy, each southwest border sector developed its own strategy
identifying specific actions that need to be taken. 

INS plans to use a phased approach to implementing its border control
strategy.  In its first phase, INS plans to focus its resources in
the two sectors where most illegal immigration has traditionally
occurred--San Diego and El Paso.  As border control is improved in
San Diego and El Paso, INS anticipates that other areas will
experience an increase in illegal entry.  Therefore, the second phase
targets the Tucson sector and the south Texas area.  The third phase
targets the rest of the southwest border, and phase four targets the
rest of the U.S.  border. 

INS has identified certain indicators that it plans to use in each of
these phases to determine whether its efforts are successful.  The
proposed indicators include (1) an eventual reduction in
apprehensions and recidivism, (2) an increase in attempted fraudulent
admissions at ports of entry, (3) a shift in the flow to other
sectors, and (4) fewer illegal immigrants in the interior of the
United States. 

To achieve border control, the strategy recognizes the need to
coordinate with other INS programs as well as other federal agencies
such as the Department of Defense, Customs Service, and the Drug
Enforcement Administration, as well as state and local law
enforcement agencies. 

INS officials told us that it will take several years to implement
the strategy and that INS did not have a specific time frame or cost
figures for these improvements.  INS officials believe that
technology improvements, such as improved fencing and surveillance
cameras, would make border control strategies more effective. 
According to the Acting Chief of the Border Patrol, these
improvements would reduce the need for significant numbers of
additional agents.  INS plans to closely monitor the strategy's
progress to determine the appropriate mix of personnel and other
types of resources needed to gain control of the U.S.  border. 


   CONCLUSIONS
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :12

We believe the new national border control strategy shows promise for
reducing illegal entry since the strategy (1) builds on the reported
success the San Diego and El Paso sectors have had in reducing
illegal immigration, (2) is consistent with recommendations made in
previous comprehensive studies conducted by border control and
physical security experts, and (3) has widespread public and
government support.  However, since it will take several years to
implement the strategy, it is too early to tell what impact it will
eventually have on drug smuggling and illegal immigration along the
southwest border. 


   AGENCY COMMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :13

On October 25, 1994, we met with the Acting Chief of the Border
Patrol and other INS officials to discuss the results of our work. 
These officials generally agreed with the information and conclusions
presented in this report.  They emphasized the importance of
sustained financial support to fully implement the national border
control strategy.

This report responds to your requests that we comment on the
recommendations contained in the National Performance Review's (NPR)
September 7, 1993, report.\1 The NPR, under the direction of the Vice
President, was a major management reform initiative by the
administration and was intended to identify ways to make the
government work better and cost less.  The NPR report's
recommendations were organized by four key principles:  &quot;cutting red
tape, putting customers first, empowering employees to get results,
and cutting back to basics.&quot; The NPR report contained 384 major
recommendations covering 27 federal agencies and 14 government
systems, such as procurement and budgeting. 

This report provides our initial comments on the NPR report's
recommendations on the basis of our work, and is the first part of a
planned long-term body of work on the NPR.  In subsequent work, we
will monitor the degree to which the NPR's recommendations have been
implemented and evaluate the extent to which the recommendations
effectively address the management and programmatic problems the NPR
identified. 


--------------------
\1 From Red Tape to Results:  Creating a Government That Works Better
and Costs Less, report of the National Performance Review, Vice
President Al Gore, September 7, 1993. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

The NPR report emphasized many of the basic themes that we have
stressed for years, including the need to strengthen management
within agencies and to focus management and accountability on the
results of programs.  Accordingly, we generally agree with most of
the NPR report's recommendations and believe that successful
implementation of those recommendations can make an important
contribution in addressing the federal government's management and
programmatic problems. 

The ultimate success of the NPR, however, will depend upon the
detailed strategies and specific actions developed to implement its
recommendations.  The administration must forge a strong, coordinated
partnership with Congress to develop these strategies.  As part of
that partnership, priority attention must be given to improving
agencies' management capacities so that they can assume additional
authority and responsibility contemplated by the NPR and be held
accountable for programmatic outcomes.  A key to improved
accountability is strengthened financial management, including
audited financial statements.  Moreover, the fundamental management
changes that are needed require the active and sustained attention of
the top political and career leadership in the agencies. 

Despite its wide scope, the NPR report contained some recommendations
that were too general for us to comment.  The NPR report also was
silent on a number of critical management and program issues
confronting the federal government that our work has shown need
prompt attention.  These additional areas of concern are detailed in
the individual sections accompanying this letter. 


.. .
   OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND
   METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

This initial examination of the NPR report's recommendations had two
objectives.  Our first objective was to review the NPR report's
recommendations.  On the basis of our work, we placed each NPR
recommendation in one of four categories: 

(1) We agree with the NPR recommendation. 

(2) We generally agree with the NPR recommendation. 

(3) We disagree with the NPR recommendation. 

(4) We have insufficient information on which to judge the merits of
the NPR recommendation either because we have not done work in the
specific area addressed by the recommendation or the recommendation
was too vague for us to comment. 

We did not review the NPR's estimated savings from implementing its
recommendations.  The Congressional Budget Office already has
analyzed some of the NPR report's recommendations from that
perspective. 

Our second objective was to identify major management and
programmatic areas of concern that were not addressed in the NPR
report.  We understand that the NPR report's recommendations will be
supplemented by a series of detailed monographs, so some of these
areas may be addressed in the subsequent NPR monographs.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ)
=========================================================== Chapter 14


      OVERALL SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:0.1

As discussed in our December 1992 transition series report on Justice
Issues, during the last decade federal, state, and local governments
have substantially increased funding for law enforcement as a result
of mounting public concern over crime (especially drugs and
violence).  Despite committing billions to the criminal justice
system and filling the nation's jails and prisons, the expectation of
reduced vulnerability to crime has not been achieved.  Furthermore,
inaccurate financial data, unrealiable financial and information
systems, and poor internal controls could result in the loss of
millions of dollars.  Given the existing criminal threat and tight
budget environment, government policymakers need to focus on getting
the most from the existing criminal justice system resources by
exploring ways to (1) strengthen the Department of Justice's
leadership and management functions; (2) better investigate and
prosecute white collar crime; (3) make needed immigration policy and
management decisions; (4) respond to a rapid rise in the federal
prison population; and (5) make antidrug efforts more effective. 

NPR's recommendations are targeted to improving the criminal justice
system in each of these five areas.  For example, NPR is seeking to
strengthen the Attorney General's oversight of law enforcement
activities, and consolidate some activities, as a means to improve
the coordination and structure of federal law enforcement.  We
support such efforts, but in the search for increased efficiency and
effectiveness, it should be recognized that some fragmentation and
inefficiencies in the criminal justice system represent a trade-off
for avoiding abuses that history has shown may occur from too much
centralized police authority. 


         GAO CONTACT
----------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:0.1.1

Henry R.  Wray, Director, Administration of Justice Issues, General
Government Division, (202) 512-5156. 


   RECOMMENDATIONS WITH WHICH GAO
   AGREES
--------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:1

DOJ02:  Improve Border Management
Federal border management should be significantly improved.  NPR
recommends a series of actions to be taken by Customs and INS to make
these improvements. 

GAO Comments
Customs and INS have a long history of interagency rivalry, poor
coordination, and ineffective cooperation, despite sharing
responsibility for primary inspections at land border ports of entry. 
We have recommended that OMB, working with the Treasury, Justice, and
State Departments, develop a proposal for ending the dual management
of border inspections. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:1.1

DOJ03:  Redirect and Better Coordinate Resources Dedicated to
Interdiction of Drugs
This recommendation outlines changes that can be made to better
coordinate federal programs directed at the air interdiction of
drugs. 

GAO Comments
We agree.  Given worldwide drug production capacity, domestic demand,
and the resourcefulness of drug smugglers to adapt to U.S. 
enforcement initiatives, the overall availability of drugs in this
country has not been diminished despite substantial increases in air
interdiction efforts and related drug seizures.  The commitment of
resources should not be made without considering the potential
effectiveness of alternative efforts, both supply and demand, and
should be based on achieving measurable goals.  Also, to better
coordinate agency efforts, improvements in information system
interoperability, data integrity, security, and overall intelligence
information management are needed. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:1.2

DOJ08:  Reinvent the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
Organization and Management
NPR recommends a number of changes in INS organization and management
processes to provide an improved management structure and a strategic
vision for the agency. 

GAO Comments
We concur.  Over the past decade, weak management systems and
inconsistent leadership at INS led to segmented autonomous programs,
each attempting to deal with its own set of problems without much
attention to the impact on other INS programs.  Without coherent
overall direction and basic management reforms, the organization has
been unable to effectively address changing enforcement
responsibilities and long-standing service delivery problems. 
Further, we have recommended the appointment of an Associate
Commissioner for Financial Management as the focal point for
developing an overall financial management plan. 


   RECOMMENDATIONS WITH WHICH GAO
   GENERALLY AGREES
--------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2

DOJ01:  Improve the Coordination and Structure of Federal Law
Enforcement Agencies
NPR recommends the designation of the Attorney General as the
Director of Law Enforcement to coordinate federal law enforcement
efforts.  It also recommends changes in the alignment of federal law
enforcement responsibilities. 

GAO Comments
We support the need for greater coordination of the numerous agencies
involved in federal law enforcement.  The decentralized operations,
including the 94 U.S.  Attorneys and the various investigative
agencies within Justice and Treasury, complicate efforts by the
Department of Justice to coordinate and direct a wide variety of
initiatives and programs to fight crime.  We have not taken a
position as to whether the various law enforcement agencies should be
consolidated into one or more agencies. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2.1

DOJ04:  Improve Department of Justice Debt Collection Efforts
This recommendation would make improvements in the Justice debt
collection effort, including giving the department the ability to
retain a small percentage of debts collected and allowing Justice to
credit its working capital fund with a percentage of debt collections
to be used for the creation of a centralized debt tracking and
information system. 

GAO Comments
We agree that the Department of Justice, as well as the
Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts, need to improve their debt
collection efforts and financial and other information systems.  Our
analysis has shown that the government had collected less than 5
percent of the fines and restitution ordered in major financial
institution fraud cases.  We have not, however, studied the
alternative financing method recommended by NPR. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2.2

DOJ05:  Improve the Bureau of Prisons Education, Job Training, and
Financial Responsibilities Programs
NPR makes a series of recommendations for improving prison education,
training, and inmate financial responsibility policies. 

GAO Comments
We agree that the Bureau of Prisons should strengthen its inmate
education and training programs.  Many inmates leave prison without
marketable job skills, English language proficiency, or completing a
secondary education, yet are expected to become assimilated into
society, i.e., become law-abiding productive citizens.  We have not
examined inmate financial responsibility policies and have no comment
on those recommendations. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2.3

DOJ06:  Improve the Management of Federal Assets Targeted for
Disposition
Improvements are needed in the methods by which the federal
government disposes of various assets. 

GAO Comments
We have assessed the asset disposition activities of selected
agencies--General Services Administration, Resolution Trust
Corporation, Customs Service, Marshals Service, and Internal Revenue
Service--and have identified the need for improvements by these
agencies.  We have recommended that the Attorney General and the
Secretary of the Treasury continue to pursue consolidating the
management and disposition of noncash seized property inventories. 
We have also initiated work to evaluate asset disposition practices
on a governmentwide basis, but as yet do not have enough information
to comment on the recommendation from this broader perspective. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2.4

DOJ07:  Reduce the Duplication of Drug Intelligence Systems and
Improve Computer Security
NPR recommends several changes to eliminate duplication in the
federal drug intelligence system. 

GAO Comments
We agree in principle but are uncertain as to the specifics of the
recommendation.  Fragmentation and duplication in the intelligence
area are an outgrowth of the overlap in responsibilities among the
numerous law enforcement and defense agencies involved in countering
drug-trafficking activities.  We have also reported on inadequate
physical and operational controls over computer security, absence of
contingency plans, and lack of computer security training at the
Department of Justice.  We believe that strong leadership, such as by
the Office of National Drug Control Policy (the office responsible
for overseeing the implementation of national drug policies) is a key
factor in streamlining the intelligence effort without compromising
security. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2.5

DOJ12:  Streamline Background Investigations for Federal Employees
The current method of completing background examinations on federal
employees is time-consuming and inefficient.  This recommendation
outlines improvements to streamline the process without sacrificing
thoroughness. 

GAO Comments
We have not specifically reviewed this issue with respect to Justice
employees.  But, given our past work at other agencies, we endorse
the concept of streamlining background investigations provided that
thoroughness is not jeopardized, particularly with respect to the
investigation of employees for sensitive positions such as those in
law enforcement. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:2.6

DOJ16:  Develop Lower Cost Solutions to Federal Prison Space Problems
This recommendation describes approaches to solving existing prison
space problems. 

GAO Comments
We agree that lower cost solutions need to be pursued, and
implemented where feasible, but it is not yet clear whether NPR's
recommendation will be limited to lowering the cost of prison design
and construction or encompass options for reducing the number of
persons sent to prison.  Between fiscal years 1986 and 1992, the
federal inmate population grew from 41,500 to more than 89,000, in
part reflecting changes in sentencing policies.  Absent a change in
those policies, the rapid growth in the federal prison population can
be expected to continue, requiring additional prison capacity. 


   RECOMMENDATIONS WITH WHICH GAO
   DISAGREES
--------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:3

None. 


   RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHICH GAO
   HAS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO
   JUDGE
--------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:4

DOJ09:  Make the Department of Justice Operate More Effectively as
the U.S.  Government Law Firm
Justice should undertake several improvements in the way it manages
its litigation functions to improve service to its customers and
better manage its case load. 

GAO Comments
We believe that improving litigation service to customers is a goal
that should be pursued by the Department.  We have reported on the
need for uniform and accurate litigative case management data and on
weaknesses in ADP management and operations, most notably in the area
of ADP security.  We have not made an in-depth evaluation of other
alternatives to existing litigation practices. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:4.1

DOJ10:  Improve White Collar Fraud Civil Enforcement
Civil fraud recovery should be established as a priority and the
department should take steps to improve its white collar fraud
enforcement. 

GAO Comments
We recognize that civil fraud recoveries are an important aspect of
white collar fraud enforcement.  See our comments on related
recommendation DOJ04.  We have not studied other alternatives to
existing practices. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:4.2

DOJ11:  Reduce the Duplication of Law Enforcement Training Facilities
Overlap and duplication in the provision of federal law enforcement
training facilities should be examined.  Multi-agency training needs
should be accommodated through existing facilities in lieu of the
construction of new facilities by individual agencies. 

GAO Comments
Although we have not studied this issue, this is an area where we
would agree that further examination could prove worthwhile.  Law
enforcement agencies, while having unique missions that require
individualized training, frequently have overlapping jurisdictions
and perform functions that require similar or identical knowledge and
skills. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:4.3

DOJ13:  Adjust Civil Monetary Penalties to the Inflation Index
Civil monetary penalties have not been adjusted to keep up with
inflation.  Under this recommendation, a &quot;catch-up&quot; adjustment would
be made and the need for additional inflation adjustments would be
automatically reassessed every four years. 

GAO Comments
At this time we have insufficient information to assess the basis for
or desirability of this recommendation.  Our work on civil debt and
criminal fines indicates that a major problem is collecting the
criminal and civil fines and penalties now imposed.  Recent Justice
estimates indicate that the total amount of unpaid criminal debt
exceeded $1.6 billion, and the balance continues to grow. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:4.4

DOJ14:  Improve Federal Courthouse Security
This recommendation is intended to address concerns of the U.S. 
Marshals Service concerning security at federal courthouses. 

GAO Comments
We recognize that federal courthouses need to be secure and Marshals
Service resources need to be targeted at the greatest security needs
based on systematic assessments of potential risk.  We have not yet
completed our ongoing review of courthouse and judicial security
issues and thus have not taken a position on these matters. 


------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 14:4.5

DOJ15:  Improve the Professionalism of the U.S.  Marshals Service
U.S.  Marshals should be selected based on merit by the Director of
the U.S.  Marshals Service and reduce some positions. 

GAO Comments
While we endorse the concept of improving the professionalism of the
Marshals Service and reducing unnecessary positions where feasible,
we have not studied this issue and thus do not have sufficient
information on which to take a position.

<h1>School Safety: Promising Initiatives for Addressing School
Violence </h1>

<pre>
<font size="2">(Letter Report, 04/25/95, GAO/HEHS-95-106).
<img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">


Many schools throughout the United States are struggling with rising
levels of youth violence.  Schools have adopted a broad range of
solutions to curb violence.  The four programs GAO visited--in
California, Ohio, and New York--are examples of some of the promising
approaches schools have initiated to address violence.  Research
suggests that the most promising school-based violence-prevention
programs involve at least some of seven key characteristics, including a
comprehensive approach, starting early, and involving parents.  Although
few prevention programs have been evaluated, some federal agencies are
now funding evaluations to examine various violence-prevention program
approaches.  The results, which should be available in three to five
years, will help determine which programs work best at curbing violence.

The Honorable Christopher J.  Dodd
Ranking Minority Member
Subcommittee on Children and Families
United States Senate

Dear Senator Dodd: 

The incidence of school violence--searches for weapons, shootings,
gang activity, fighting, and other instances of disruptive
behavior--has risen to unacceptable levels.  Nearly 3 million crimes
occur in or near the nation's 85,000 public schools every year\1
--about one every 6 seconds.  Further, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 105 violent
school-related deaths occurred during the past 2 years.  Such
conditions create environments that impede teaching and learning and
make parents reluctant to send their children to school.  In fact, a
recent national survey listed school order and safety as parents' top
priority--right along with teaching the basics (reading, writing, and
arithmetic).\2 Ending the epidemic of youth violence will not be
easy.  According to violence-prevention experts, no simple solution
exists.  However, individuals, groups, and community organizations
are beginning to work with schools to develop programs aimed at
stopping youth violence before it starts. 

This report responds to your request for information about some of
the programs used by schools to curb violence.  As agreed with your
staff, we (1) examined four promising prevention programs, obtaining
teacher and student views on these efforts; and reviewed evaluation
data on these programs; (2) identified key characteristics typically
associated with promising school-based violence-prevention programs;
and (3) identified federally sponsored evaluations of
violence-prevention programs operating in schools. 

To answer your questions, we reviewed the research literature on
youth violence-prevention, and interviewed violence-prevention
program directors, federal agency officials, and acknowledged
experts.  In addition, we visited four programs in four cities that
have shown signs of success.  During visits, we talked with students,
teachers, and school administrators.  In addition, we interviewed
federal agency officials concerning their efforts to evaluate
violence-prevention programs.  (See app.  VII for more details on our
scope and methodology).

Schools,&quot; Public Agenda, New York, New York (1994). 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

The four school-based violence-prevention programs that we visited
all show initial signs of success.  Schools in the Anaheim,
California, program, stressing school management and order issues,
reported reductions in the incidents of student fighting, graffiti,
and defiance of authority.  Paramount, California, schools uses an
antigang curriculum to reduce gang membership among students who
participated in the program.  The Dayton, Ohio, program provides
students with social skills and anger-management training.  According
to program officials, student participants had fewer juvenile court
charges than a comparable group of students.  Similarly, a New York
City program has used conflict-resolution and peer-mediation training
to reduce student fighting.  For example, 71 percent of teachers
observed less physical violence among student participants. 

Violence-prevention literature and experts consistently associate at
least seven characteristics with promising school-based
violence-prevention programs.  These characteristics are (1) a
comprehensive approach, (2) an early start and long-term commitment,
(3) strong leadership and disciplinary policies, (4) staff
development, (5) parental involvement, (6) interagency partnerships
and community linkages, and (7) a culturally sensitive and
developmentally appropriate approach.  For example, teaching students
early about making positive choices and linking school-based programs
to community groups, such as law enforcement or service agencies, are
approaches associated with promising programs. 

Although few violence-prevention programs have been evaluated,
efforts are underway to identify successful approaches for curbing
school violence.  For example, during fiscal years 1992 and 1993, we
identified 26 federal grants (approximately $28 million) that help to
evaluate the effectiveness of various school-based
violence-prevention programs.  In addition, recent actions to
increase collaboration among federal agencies could also enhance
efforts to identify promising programs by providing opportunities for
sharing expertise and resources. 


   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

During the past decade, the Congress has expressed its concern for
student safety and school security through numerous hearings and the
introduction of several bills aimed at reducing youth violence.  In
1994, a desire to help make schools safe prompted the Congress to
pass two bills explicitly targeting school violence: 

The Safe Schools Act of 1994 authorizes the Secretary of Education to
make grants to local school districts with high rates of youth
violence.  Schools may use these grants to support educational
activities to reduce violence and promote safety.  For fiscal year
1994, approximately $20 million was appropriated for this program. 

The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994 authorizes
the Secretary of Education to make grants to states to prevent
violence in and around schools as well as to deter the use of illegal
drugs and alcohol.  Allowable activities include violence-prevention
and education programs for students, training and technical
assistance, and developing comprehensive violence and drug prevention
programs that involve parents and coordination with community groups
and agencies.\3 Fiscal year 1995 appropriations for this program were
approximately $482 million.\4

In addition, in 1994 the Congress passed the Family and Community
Endeavor Schools Act, which established the Schools and Community
Endeavor Schools Program and the Community Schools Youth Services and
Supervision Program.  This act authorizes the Departments of
Education and Health and Human Services to provide grants to improve
the overall development of at-risk children in communities with
significant poverty and violent crime.  Allowable activities include
developing after-school programs that provide homework assistance and
educational, social, and athletic activities.  The fiscal year 1995
appropriation for the Schools and Community Endeavor Schools Program
was $11 million, while The Community Schools Youth Services and
Supervision Program received $25.6 million. 


--------------------
\3 Formerly the Drug-Free Schools and Community Act, in 1994 its
authorization was expanded to include violence-prevention as a key
program element. 

\4 The Department of Education is scheduled for disbursement in June
1995.  However, in March 1995, all funds were proposed for rescission
by the House Committee on Appropriations. 


      SCHOOL-BASED
      VIOLENCE-PREVENTION PROGRAMS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1

Schools use a wide variety of educational and noneducational
approaches and programs to address violence.  Many school-based
violence-prevention programs operate under the premise that violence
is a learned behavior.  In general, these programs focus on primary
prevention; that is, they seek to prevent violence before it occurs. 
Although school-based violence-prevention programs and strategies
vary, most fall within the three broad categories listed below. 

Educational and curricula-based:  These programs seek to teach
students the skills to manage their behavior and resolve conflict
nonviolently.  Programs in this category focus on conflict
resolution, gang aversion, social skills training, mentoring, and
law-related education. 

Environmental modification:  These programs focus on either the
social or physical environment.  Programs aimed at improving
students' social environment include home visitation and after-school
recreational and academic activities.  Programs that seek to modify
students' physical environment include installing metal detectors and
gates limiting access to building entrances and exits. 

School organization and management:  These programs focus on
establishing school discipline policies and procedures that pertain
to student behavior, creating alternative schools, and developing
cooperative relationships with police and other government agencies. 
Legal efforts to regulate the use of and access to weapons in schools
also fall into this category. 

A survey of its members by the National School Boards Association
(NSBA) showed the wide variety of violence-prevention programs
operating in schools.\5 According to the 1993 report, Violence in the
Schools:  How America's School Boards Are Safeguarding Our Children,
the responding school districts implemented more than 750 different
violence-prevention programs.  For reporting districts, overall
responses ranged from establishing alternative schools or programs
for disruptive students (66 percent) to implementing
conflict-resolution and peer-mediation training (61 percent) to
developing safe havens (alternative after-school programs) for
students (10 percent).  (See app.  I for a complete listing of school
district responses.)

In a 1993 report, The Prevention of Youth Violence:  A Framework for
Community Action, the CDC highlighted several community programs
designed to prevent youth violence, including those with activities
closely linked to schools.  For example, according to program
descriptions: 

In Atlanta, Georgia, the Go to High School, Go to College project has
paired 100 successful older men with adolescent African-American
males at four Atlanta high schools and one middle school.  Each
mentor meets weekly with a student who is struggling academically,
has discipline problems, or is at risk of dropping out of school. 
The mentors are provided with a 40-page curriculum of instructions
and ideas.  Mentors strive to increase the students' self-esteem and
improve their grades.  A local fraternity chapter provides
scholarships to students in the program who qualify and want to
attend college. 

In New Haven, Connecticut, the public school system in collaboration
with the Yale School of Psychology provides training in social skills
in all the district's middle schools.  The curriculum emphasizes
self-control, stress- management, problem-solving, decision-making,
and communication skills.  Once students have learned a general
problem-solving framework, they apply their critical-thinking skills
to specific issues, such as substance use. 

In Oakland, California, Teens on Target, a peer education and
mentoring group, was formed after two junior high students were shot
in school by other students.  Teens on Target grew out of a task
force, made up of a coalition of elected officials, parents, and
school and community agency representatives, who felt that students
would do a better job of dealing with the youth violence problem than
adults.  Selected high school students are trained in an intensive
summer program to be violence-prevention advocates, particularly in
the areas of guns, drugs, and family violence.  These students become
peer educators to other high school students and mentors to younger
students in the middle and elementary schools. 

Another innovative program--the Beacon Initiative--operates in New
York City, where about 36 schools now stay open 7 days a week from
early morning until late evening--providing &quot;one stop shopping&quot;
services such as counseling, tutoring, recreational activities,
vocational training, and a safe place for kids to &quot;hang out.&quot;


--------------------
\5 The NSBA surveyed more than 2,000 national affiliate school
districts, of which 729 school districts responded.  The results are
not generalizable. 


   FOUR PROMISING PROGRAMS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3


      PROGRAMS SEEK TO STOP
      VIOLENCE BEFORE IT STARTS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1

Creating an orderly and disciplined school environment, free of
violence, is essential for learning to take place.  Consequently,
many schools and communities across the nation are working together
to develop solutions to prevent violence.  Although school violence
is a challenging issue, some school-based prevention programs appear
to be promising approaches for curbing violence.  Table 1 summaries
the key features of the four programs that we visited.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each program has received national recognition for its innovative
approach in addressing school violence and illustrates the types of
partnerships schools and communities have formed to curb violence. 
Each is summarized below. 

Anaheim, California's SMART program has been applauded by federal
officials as a key effort in addressing school management and order
issues.  According to program officials, SMART has been disseminated
across the country as a model school management program that allows
administrators to determine at the push of a button the number and
location of policy violations, offenses, and crimes committed in each
school. 

The SMART program operates districtwide, using a computerized data
collection system to identify and address school and law violations. 
SMART teams analyze data from the system to identify and develop
solutions to discipline problems.  A key SMART program element is its
focus on school problems, not problem schools.  (See app.  II for
more details on this program.)

Dayton, Ohio's PACT program has received wide recognition as a model
program and valuable resource for addressing violence among
African-American youth by several national organizations and leaders
in the field of violence-prevention.  Program officials describe PACT
as a culturally sensitive training program developed specifically for
middle-school-age African-American youth to reduce their
disproportionate risk of becoming victims or perpetrators of
violence.  The program especially addresses the problem of violence
that involves loss of control between family, friends, or
acquaintances and represents the greatest threat to adolescents. 

PACT builds on research that suggests that prevention programs are
most successful for economically disadvantaged and minority youth
when developed with sensitivity to racial, ethnic, and cultural
issues.  The program's training materials are based on the rationale
that adolescents who lack skill in such areas as communication,
negotiation, and problem-solving have a limited range of alternatives
with which to solve interpersonal problems.  Consequently, PACT
provides structured training in specific behavioral aspects of social
skills that enhance the capacity of students to form and maintain
violence-free relationships.  (See app.  III for more details on this
program.)

New York, New York's RCCP program is widely regarded as one of the
most promising violence-prevention programs among public health
experts.  RCCP is a school-based program in conflict resolution and
intergroup relations that provides a model for preventing violence
and creating caring schools that are conducive for learning. 
According to the program officials, RCCP teaches students that they
have many choices besides passivity or aggression for dealing with
conflict, gives them the skills to make those choices real in their
own lives, increases their understanding and appreciation of their
own and others' cultures, and shows them that they play a powerful
role in creating a peaceful world. 

The program's primary strategy for reaching young people is
professional development of the adults in their lives--principals,
teachers, and parents.  RCCP works intensively with teachers,
introducing them to the concepts and skills of conflict resolution
and diversity.  Through ongoing staff development, teachers are
supported as they teach these concepts and skills in an ongoing way
to their students.  (See app.  IV for more details on this program.)

Paramount, California's ATGM program has been widely replicated and
officials have responded to almost 1,000 requests for information
about the program.  Cited as an exemplary gang membership prevention
program in several journals, the program has been visited by
individuals from Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa, according to
program officials.  The ATGM program seeks to reduce the number of
gang members and their destructive actions within the community by
teaching students the harmful consequences of a gang lifestyle.  (See
Appendix V for more detailed information.)

ATGM's approach is based on the belief that interest in gangs begins
at a young age and that a successful antigang program must reach
students early.  Consequently, the program targets students (most of
whom are Latino) in the 2nd, 5th, and 7th grades.  The program uses
three approaches to achieve its objectives:  (1) an elementary school
antigang curriculum, (2) an intermediate school follow-up program,
and (3) neighborhood meetings with parents and residents.  (See app. 
V for more details on this program.)


      STUDENTS AND TEACHERS
      BELIEVE PROGRAMS MAKE A
      DIFFERENCE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.2

Nearly all discussion group participants at the four programs'
schools that we visited said their violence-prevention programs were
useful, helped de-escalate conflict, and taught important coping
skills that students need to make positive choices.  Most discussion
group participants agreed that students often lack the skills needed
to make productive and positive decisions.  For example, several
students who participated in conflict-resolution and anger-management
programs said that before their training, they had not considered
resolving disagreements and conflicts without fighting.  One student
told us: 

     &quot;I didn't know any other way to resolve my problems besides
     fighting.  Now instead of fighting, I work it out and talk about
     it.  I've got some options.&quot;

In addition, discussion group participants generally agreed that
programs empowered students and helped them avoid violence by
teaching them to (1) identify and solve problems through
role-playing, group discussions, mediation, and other learning
strategies, such as videos; and (2) make positive decisions,
recognize that they have choices, and understand the consequences of
their actions (for example that fighting, joining gangs, or engaging
in other nonproductive behavior may result in suspension from school,
personal injury, or death). 

Students and teachers we talked with expressed concern that
disruptive behavior and violence prevent meaningful learning.  They
told us that disruptive students interrupt the learning process by
distracting other students and the teacher.  According to one
teacher: 

     &quot;Sometimes, teachers can't teach because they've got to stop and
     deal with hostile situations.  .  .  we're teaching students
     skills they should learn at home.&quot;

In addition, participants expressed concern that moneys intended for
instructional materials, staff development, and other educational
needs were spent on security efforts. 

Although students and teachers perceived their programs as
successful, they unequivocally stated that no one program or approach
could curb school violence.  They generally agreed that curbing
school violence requires a combinations of approaches.\6 In addition
to the key characteristics discussed later, students and teachers
suggested strengthening efforts to curb violence by

increasing the availability of violence-prevention programs,

providing after-school activities (especially sports),

reducing class sizes,

addressing physical child abuse and neglect,

providing services for at-risk families,

establishing a uniform dress code,

penalizing students who watch fights,

reducing easy access to guns, and

improving economic conditions. 


--------------------
\6 These comments are consistent with violence and drug education
research literature that suggest that comprehensive approaches that
involve parents and the community as well as classroom instruction
and counseling programs are more likely to achieve desired changes. 


      PRELIMINARY EVALUATIONS SHOW
      SIGNS OF SUCCESS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.3

The authors of the preliminary evaluations that we reviewed concluded
that the four programs showed initial signs of success because
student participants' attitudes and behaviors had changed.  Reported
participant changes included:  (1) new attitudes toward violence and
gang membership; (2) less disruptive behavior, including fewer
fights; and (3) less contact with the criminal justice system.  Based
on pre- and post-tests of knowledge and attitudes, behavioral
observations, self-reporting, and in some cases tracking student
behavior, the evaluations reported the following signs of success: 

Anaheim, California's SMART--The number of police activity reports
filed dropped from 189 during the spring semester of 1993 to 93
during the fall semester of 1993, according to SMART's incident
profiling system.  In addition, student offenses dropped or stayed
the same in all but nine categories--despite increases in crime
within the community. 

Dayton, Ohio's PACT--For the 1992 school year, first semester PACT
participants had a 50-percent reduction in incidents of physical
aggression, while nonparticipants (the control group) had a
25-percent increase.  Similarly second semester PACT participants had
a 53-percent reduction, while nonparticipants had a 56-percent
increase. 

New York City's RCCP--A 1988-89 school year evaluation of RCCP
teachers revealed that (1) 66 percent observed less student
name-calling and fewer verbal put-downs, (2) 89 percent agreed that
the mediation program had helped students take more responsibility
for solving their own problems, and (3) 71 percent reported that
students demonstrated less physical violence. 

Paramount, California's ATGM--After participating in the program, 90
percent of the students responded negatively to the idea of joining a
gang.  Based on a follow-up survey, most students maintained that
response a year later.  Further, a 1993 cross-check of the names of
more than 3,500 past participants with the names of approximately
1,600 known gang members found only a 4-percent match. 

Collectively, the evaluations showed high levels of enthusiasm and
support for the programs.  Although these results are promising, the
limited nature of the evaluations prevent concluding that
improvements in student behavior resulted from program participation. 
Determining whether these programs reduce violence among students
over the long term requires more carefully designed evaluations that
focus on the programs' actual impact on behavior.  Such evaluation
design matters are discussed further below. 


      PRELIMINARY EVALUATIONS NEED
      STRONGER DESIGNS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.4

A general consensus exists that while preliminary evaluations of
violence-prevention programs are a useful starting point, most lack
the methodological rigor needed to determine their effectiveness.  To
improve the usefulness of future evaluations, greater emphasis should
be placed on designing stronger impact or effectiveness studies.\7
Design issues requiring particular attention include:  sampling
techniques, longitudinal assessment, random assignment, and
collection of impact (fewer fights) and outcome measures (reduced
injury). 

To determine whether violence-prevention programs really cause
observed behavioral change, evaluators should compare the outcomes
achieved by students in randomly assigned treatment and control
groups.\8 For example, concerning the Paramount, California, ATGM
program cross-checking mentioned earlier, how many (or how few)
students would have joined gangs in the absence of the program is not
clear.  Because the evaluation design did not use random assignment,
linking changes in student behavior to program participation is
difficult.  Finally, longitudinal follow-up on students for 4 to 5
years after participation (or until they leave school) would show to
what extent initially observed effects persist over time. 

The program officials that we talked with acknowledged the need for
stronger evaluation designs that focus on program effectiveness. 
However, they said that the high cost of program evaluation, coupled
with a lack of skilled research and evaluation staff, generally
precluded developing stronger designs.  They said that implementing
programs (which many perceive as doing something about the problem of
violence) has more prestige than evaluating programs.  Consequently,
although funders want data on participant outcomes, they focus on
program implementation rather than evaluation. 

According to program officials, doing impact evaluations with
stronger designs depends on obtaining grants or private funds
specifically for that purpose.  For example, PACT has been able to
develop comparison groups and has longitudinal outcomes based on
funding received from private sources for its evaluation efforts. 
However, at the time that we completed our work, only one of the
other four programs we visited had received such funding.  In
September 1993, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control
at CDC awarded the New York RCCP program a 3-year, $729,000 grant to
conduct a detailed impact evaluation.  The three-pronged evaluation
will include (1) a longitudinal process and impact study, (2) an
in-depth observational and qualitative study, and (3) development of
a management information system. 


--------------------
\7 Impact evaluations focus on program effectiveness.  Impact
evaluations are methodologically rigorous studies that use scientific
research methods to estimate to what extent participant outcomes (for
example, reductions in the prevalence of violence) occur because of
program participation. 

\8 True experimental design requires random assignment to treatment
and comparison group.  Although this is an analytically strong
methodology, it can be costly and require administrative control over
the program.  In some circumstances, quasi-experimental designs may
be adequate when a true experimental design is not feasible. 


   PROMISING PROGRAMS INCORPORATE
   SEVEN KEY CHARACTERISTICS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

Conclusive evidence concerning the effectiveness of specific programs
is not yet available.  Nevertheless, some indications of promising
program characteristics exist, especially in school settings.  Based
on our literature review, discussions with school safety experts, and
visits to violence-prevention programs, we identified seven
characteristics associated with promising school-based
violence-prevention programs (see fig.  1). 

   Figure 1:  Promising Programs
   Incorporate Seven Key
   Characteristics

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Comprehensive approach:  Recognizes violence as a complex problem
that requires a multifaceted response.  Consequently, these programs
address more than one problem area and involve a variety of services
that link schools to the community. 

Early start and long-term commitment:  Focuses on (1) reaching young
children to shape attitudes, knowledge, and behavior while they are
still open to positive influences, and (2) sustaining the
intervention over multiple years (for example, from kindergarten
through 12th grade). 

Strong leadership and disciplinary policies:  Show strong leadership
at the school level.  Principals and school administrators need to
sustain stable funding, staff, and program components and most
important, they must collaborate with others to reach program goals. 
In addition, student disciplinary policies and procedures are clear
and consistently applied. 

Staff development:  Provides training for key school administrators,
teachers, and staff that equips them to handle disruptive students
and mediate conflict as well as understand and incorporate prevention
strategies into their school activities. 

Parental involvement:  Seeks to increase parental involvement in
school efforts to reduce violence by providing training on
violence-prevention skills, making home visits, and using parents as
volunteers. 

Interagency partnerships and community linkages:  Seeks community
support in making school antiviolence policies and programs work by
developing collaborative agreements in which school personnel, local
businesses, law enforcement officers, social service agencies, and
private groups work together to address the multiple causes of
violence. 

Culturally sensitive and developmentally appropriate:  Considers (1)
racial ethnic students' cultural values and norms by using bilingual
materials and culturally appropriate program activities, role models,
and leaders; and (2) participants' age and level of development in
designing program materials and activities. 

Although researchers advocate the use of these key characteristics,
few violence-prevention programs incorporate all seven
characteristics. 


   FEDERAL EVALUATION EFFORTS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

Our analysis of program descriptions contained in the Federal Agency
Juvenile Delinquency Development Statements for the 3-year period
1990 to 1992, showed that 11 agencies funded 115 research programs or
evaluations (ranging from $108 to $133 million annually) that
addressed youth violence.  However, only one grant provided funding
to evaluate a school-based violence-prevention program. 

More recently, some federal officials have acknowledged the need to
focus available resources on identifying violence-prevention programs
and strategies that work.  For example, three research-based
agencies--CDC, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), and the
National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH)--have taken the lead in
funding impact evaluations to study the effectiveness of specific
school-based interventions.  These three agencies awarded about 26
grants totaling approximately $27 million for this purpose during
fiscal years 1993 and 1994 (see app.  VI for a list of these
studies). 

The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994 presents
an opportunity for the federal government to strengthen efforts to
determine the effectiveness of various violence-prevention programs
and approaches.  The act authorizes up to $1 million for a national
impact evaluation.  The act also authorizes up to $25 million in
discretionary funding for national programs--evaluation is one of
many allowable activities. 


      GREATER COLLABORATION NEEDED
      AMONG FEDERAL AGENCIES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1

Increased collaboration among federal agencies could significantly
leverage federal funds and enhance efforts to identify and
disseminate information on promising violence-prevention programs. 
At least three federal departments--Education, Health and Human
Services, and Justice--support school-based violence-prevention
research and programming.  However, these individual departments have
not mounted a comprehensive strategy for addressing school violence. 
Further, although these departments occasionally work together, a
formal mechanism to facilitate collaboration and coordination on
school violence issues has not yet been developed.  Agency officials
cite budget constraints as a major factor necessitating greater
collaboration. 

According to federal officials, effective collaboration requires (1)
sharing resources (both staff and funding) and information (such as
research and programmatic plans and priorities) and (2) developing
clear roles and responsibilities for each federal department to
ensure a comprehensive approach that avoids overlapping and
duplicative efforts.  Consequently, the mechanism for coordination
and collaboration should facilitate planning and program integration,
not merely information sharing.  Although the Federal Coordinating
Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention is responsible
for coordinating the efforts of federal agencies concerning juvenile
delinquency and delinquency prevention; the group only recently
convened--after a 2-year hiatus.\9

Further, federal officials told us that in the past the actual level
of participation on the Coordinating Council was insufficient to
effectively facilitate the type of coordination and collaboration
needed.  However, efforts are now underway to revitalize the
Coordinating Council since a new Administrator for the Office of
Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) has been selected. 

Some federal collaborative efforts concerning violence-prevention
programming have started.  For instance, the National School Safety
Center (NSSC) and the SMART program represent successful interagency
collaborations.\10 In both instances, the Departments of Justice and
Education shared funding and staff to implement these programs.  In
addition, for the past 2 years, these agencies and several others
have collaborated in sponsoring a national violence-prevention
conference.  Expected benefits from increased collaboration among
federal agencies include development of

a comprehensive long-term federal violence-prevention research
agenda,

stronger evaluation designs that result in firmer conclusions about
program effectiveness,

a database with information summarizing the cumulative results of
program evaluations across agencies,

a process for identifying successful programs, and

a central on-line database for disseminating information on
successful programs. 


--------------------
\9 The Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention was established through Section 206 of the Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention (JJDP) Act.  The Chairman of the
Coordinating Council is the Attorney General of the United States;
the Vice Chairman is the Administrator for the Office of Juvenile
Justice Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). 

\10 NSSC represents a partnership between the Departments of Justice
and Education and Pepperdine University.  The NSSC, which serves as a
clearinghouse, focuses national attention on school safety issues and
solutions. 


   CONCLUSIONS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6

Many schools throughout our nation are struggling with rising levels
of youth violence in and around schools.  Schools have adopted a
broad range of solutions to curb violence.  The four programs we
visited--in California, Ohio, and New York--represent examples of
some of the promising approaches schools have implemented to address
violence. 

Research suggests that the most promising school-based
violence-prevention programs will involve at least seven key
characteristics.  Among these characteristics are a comprehensive
approach, starting early, and involving parents.  Although few
prevention programs have been evaluated, some federal agencies are
funding evaluations to examine several violence-prevention program
approaches.  The results, which should be available in about 3 to 5
years, will help determine which programs work best at curbing
violence.

ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA:  SCHOOL
MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCE TEAMS
PROGRAM, ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL
DISTRICT
========================================================== Appendix II


   DISTRICT PROFILE
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1

The Anaheim Union High School District's (AUHSD) enrollment in grades
7 through 12 increased about 5 percent over the past 3 years to the
1993-94 level of about 26,000.  AUHSD students come from seven
different cities--La Palma, Cypress, Stanton, Buena Park, Anaheim,
Garden Grove, and Fullerton.  AUHSD has eight high schools, eight
junior high schools, and a variety of alternative education sites. 
Students with limited or no English skills account for 35 percent of
the student population.  In the 1993-94 school year, over 34 percent
of the students were eligible for free or reduced price lunches. 

Like many school districts nationwide, AUHSD began experiencing
problems with drug abuse, crime, and gangs in the late 1970s.  The
number of identified gangs and gang members increased significantly
from 1985 to 1994.  In 1985, AUHSD communities had eight gangs with
an estimated 179 members.  Today, local police departments have
identified over 50 gangs with about 2,100 members.  AUHSD has
initiated several strategies to combat crime in and around their
schools.  AUHSD has a zero tolerance policy for gangs, weapons, and
drugs on campuses.  Also, AUHSD has an antigang dress code and
closed-campus policy.  AUHSD schools have nonuniformed community
volunteers to help with security, but do not use metal detectors. 
The Anaheim Police Department has assigned two officers to work
full-time on gang prevention activities in the district.  AUHSD
officials are also experimenting with other methods of school
security.  For example, they have placed mobile homes on several
school campuses.  Retired persons live in the homes rent-free in
exchange for helping to deter after-hours school vandalism. 


   PROGRAM OVERVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2

In the late 1970s, AUHSD officials sought ways to combat the rising
levels of crime in their communities.  They participated in training
to identify, categorize, and log incidents on campus and design
appropriate interventions.  These training efforts turned into the
SMART program.  In 1983, the U.S.  Department of Justice, National
Institute of Justice (NIJ), and the U.S.  Department of Education
jointly funded SMART as a pilot in AUHSD and two other sites. 
SMART's goal is to improve school safety and discipline by combining
information technology with concepts in school team-building and
interagency coordination. 

Since 1983, AUHSD administrators and staff have developed and
integrated the SMART program districtwide.  SMART consists of five
program components that operate together and provide a unified
approach to school safety and discipline: 

Commitment.  The primary SMART requirement is the commitment of the
superintendent and principals to improve school safety and
discipline. 

Safety and security audit.  Program officials conduct an audit of
district policies and practices affecting drugs, crime, discipline,
and student/faculty safety to help clarify responsibilities for
school officials in dealing with different types of crime and
discipline problems. 

Incident Profiling System.  The Incident Profiling System (IPS) is a
computerized procedure by which each school records disciplinary
infractions and criminal acts.  IPS generates reports describing
patterns of disruptions and crimes.  It tracks the types of
incidents, locations, times, and persons involved. 

SMART teams.  SMART teams include students, parents, teachers,
support staff, law enforcement/security, and administrators.  SMART
teams meet monthly to analyze current IPS data, set priorities,
devise actions to reduce problems, and monitor results.  Each team
prepares a SMART plan to reduce priority problems. 

Interagency coordination.  AUHSD officials meet with representatives
from juvenile justice, social service, and law enforcement agencies
to coordinate their responses to youth who commit crimes or have
behavior problems. 

The core of the SMART program is the statistical information gathered
through IPS.  This computerized system enables AUHSD officials to
collect and analyze a wide range of information about student
discipline.  Over the years, AUHSD officials have developed their own
computer program to record and track disruptive events and
individuals.  School officials are responsible for completing a
machine-scannable form on any disruptive event or individual they
encounter.  IPS data include rule violations such as a failure to
serve detention and law violations such as robbery, sex offenses,
drug or weapons possession, assaults, and property crimes. 

AUHSD principals and SMART teams compile and analyze IPS data at the
school level to dispel rumor, to identify and characterize discipline
problems, and to assess the consequence of actions taken.  Principals
can identify the areas of the school and the period of the day when
the most violence or disruption occurs and the individual students
who are causing a disproportionate amount of disruption.  Once the
principal has this information, he or she convenes a SMART team. 
This team produces and monitors a school SMART plan concentrating on
one topic at a time.  For example, a team may concentrate on locker
thefts.  A district SMART teams follows a similar process when
analyzing districtwide information. 

AUHSD principals, counselors, and staff have developed an integrated
service model to handle students or systemic problems identified by
SMART data.  This model provides a mechanism for schools to work with
the community, governmental agencies, and local businesses to meet
the needs of these at-risk students.  Services provided through this
integrated approach include peer tutoring, alcohol- and
drug-prevention programs, crisis intervention, and
conflict-resolution training. 


   PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND
   EVALUATION EFFORTS
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3

AUHSD officials have conducted extensive internal evaluations of the
SMART program that compare trends in IPS data.  In general, district
statistics show that incidents on campuses have increased gradually
while levels of crime in the surrounding communities have increased
at a much faster rate.  AUHSD officials cited recent outcome
information generated from IPS:  (1) 55 percent of the 37 main
categories of incidents have declined since 1993,\11 (2) police
activity on campus is down 51 percent from the spring semester 1993
to 1994, and (3) the reported total costs of incidents have dropped
66 percent from the fall semester 1991 to 1993. 

In 1992, NIJ and the Department of Education contracted with the
Center for Research and Evaluation in Social Policy\12

for an external evaluation of the SMART program.  The report focused
on SMART's usefulness--based on interviews, SMART data, and internal
documents.  The evaluators found strong support and encouragement for
the SMART program among school board members, the superintendent, and
district and school staff.  Further, they found that AUHSD officials
developed a depth of understanding and experience well beyond the
core elements of SMART.  They also found evidence that schools using
the SMART program had reduced problems with graffiti, fighting,
failure to attend detention, and defiance of authority.  The report
concluded that AUHSD officials have institutionalized SMART into its
daily operations and are taking positive actions as a result of the
SMART program.  The report also concluded that SMART and related
systems have increased the level of confidence of parents, students,
and teachers in school safety. 


--------------------
\11 Incident categories that have declined include assaults, battery,
robbery, possession of destructive devices, property crimes, forgery,
tardiness, weapons, failure to serve detention, throwing objects,
threats/intimidation, profanity, tobacco, and off-campus incidents. 

\12 Draft report No.  P-557, Graduate School of Education, University
of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 


   MAJOR SUCCESS FACTORS
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4

AUHSD officials believe that the following key factors contribute to
the SMART program's success: 

using a systematic problem-solving approach to resolve school crime
and discipline problems;

focusing on local control;

using existing resources with minimal additional funding;

developing positive working relationships among educators, parents,
students, local leaders, and community agencies; and

focusing on school problems, not problem schools. 


   IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:5

The main barrier that AUHSD officials encountered was in designing
the computer data files, reports, and forms to support SMART.  AUHSD
officials have spent considerable time and effort in developing their
own computer system to fit their needs.  AUHSD officials stated that
they have experimented with three generations of computer programs
since SMART's inception.  School officials currently use a
machine-scannable form to record incidents.  They also developed a
SMART data dictionary that lists various identifying characteristics
of individuals and events and types of violations committed.  IPS
generates numerous computer reports to identify problems and make
comparisons.  This system has also been programmed to provide school
safety information required by California. 

AUHSD representatives have briefed other districts interested in
their SMART computer program.  They said that their system could be
easily replicated in other school districts.  However, dissemination
efforts are contingent on future funding. 


   FUNDING SOURCES
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:6

Since 1983, AUHSD has had various levels of funding from NIJ and the
Department of Education.  Over the years, AUHSD used these federal
funds for a variety of activities, such as program dissemination and
site coordinator stipends, training, and conferences.  AUHSD has
funded most of SMART operating expenses out of its general funds
since SMART's inception.  Major ongoing expenses for 18 sites during
1993-94 totaled about $37,000.  This estimate includes site
coordinator stipends ($16,000), materials/supplies ($4,000), and a
part-time program specialist ($17,000).  In addition, NIJ and the
Department of Education awarded AUHSD a grant of $40,000 in 1993-94
to enhance program interventions with conflict-resolution training,
training packets, and training for new administrators. 


DAYTON, OHIO:  POSITIVE
ADOLESCENTS CHOICES TRAINING
PROGRAM ROTH MIDDLE SCHOOL
========================================================= Appendix III


   DISTRICT PROFILE
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:1

The Dayton public school system serves approximately 27,000 students. 
The district offers 5 high schools, 7 middle schools, 35 elementary
schools, and several centers with specialized programs of study. 
About 65 percent of the district's students are African-American. 
Most of the student population is educationally and economically
disadvantaged; all schools within the district qualify for Title I
funding.\13 In addition, about 70 percent of the students participate
in the free or reduced-price lunch program. 

Violence is a growing concern within the district.  During the 1990
school year, 152 students were referred to the principal for
disciplinary action because they carried weapons in school.  To help
maintain safe school environments, walk-thru metal detectors were
installed in all middle and high schools in November 1992.  During
the first 2 years of metal detector use, districtwide expulsions and
suspension rates for weapons-related incidents declined.  For
example, expulsions dropped from 200 in school year 1991-92 to 120 in
school year 1992-93.  Similarly, suspensions dropped from 3,483 in
school year 1991-92 to 3,311 in school year 1992-93. 


--------------------
\13 The Title I program (formerly Chapter I), authorized under the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, serves
educationally deprived children--children whose educational
attainment is below the level that is appropriate for their age--in
relatively high-poverty areas. 


   PROGRAM OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2

PACT is a violence-prevention program directed specifically at middle
school African-American youth.  Staff from the School of Professional
Psychology at Wright State University implement the PACT program in
cooperation with Dayton Public Schools.  The program began operation
in 1989.  Since the beginning of the program, more than 130 youths
have been trained. 

PACT uses the rationale that adolescents who lack skills in such
areas as communication, negotiation, and problem-solving have a
limited range of alternatives with which to solve interpersonal
problems.  In addition, the program builds on research that suggests
that violence-prevention interventions with economically
disadvantaged and minority youth are most successful when developed
with sensitivity to racial, ethnic, and cultural issues.  Therefore,
the program uses African-American role models to create a learning
environment directly relevant to the lives of African-American
adolescents.  Teachers refer participants based on perceived skill
deficiencies in peer relations, behavior problems (particularly
aggression), or history of victimization by violence.  PACT training
uses small groups, composed of 10 to 12 students (12 to 15 years
old).  Training is provided twice a week at Roth Middle School during
regular school hours.  Groups generally receive about 38 training
sessions, each lasting about 50 minutes (the duration of a classroom
period).  Two doctoral-level clinical psychology students facilitate
each training session. 

The principal PACT program components include

training in three social skills (giving negative feedback, receiving
negative feedback, and negotiation),

training in anger management skills (techniques to control or express
anger constructively), and

education or information about violence (awareness-building lessons
on the nature and extent of violence). 

Three videotaped vignettes feature African-American role models
demonstrating how some of the target skills are used:  The &quot;Givin'
It&quot; video introduces skills on how to express angry feelings in a
calm, nonthreatening manner.  The &quot;Takin' It&quot; video introduces skills
on how to receive negative feedback without acting irrationally or
becoming overly upset.  The &quot;Workin' It Out&quot; video introduces skills
on how to solve problems or work out a compromise to a conflict
without resorting to aggressive or violent behavior. 

Principal techniques used during training sessions include modeling,
coaching, role-playing, feedback, and homework (practicing the skills
outside of class).  In addition, program facilitators use an
incentive system that rewards active participation and appropriate
behavior (such as being on time and following directions) during
training sessions.  For example, students receive success
dollars--paper money that can be exchanged for various gift items,
such as cassette tapes, candy or food, T-shirts, jewelry, or games. 


   PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND
   EVALUATION EFFORTS
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:3

PACT evaluations seek to measure both process and behavioral effects
of the program.  In addition, since 1989, staff conducted
longitudinal followup through juvenile court on all PACT-trained
students.  An evaluation of the 1989-90 project year showed that
youth who participated in the program demonstrated improvement in all
target skill areas (for example, giving and accepting negative
feedback, problem-solving, and resisting peer pressure).  A 1992-93
outcome study demonstrated that the PACT participants had less
involvement in fighting and fewer referrals to juvenile court in
comparison with a control group that did not receive training.  For
example, PACT-trained students

demonstrated a 50-percent reduction in physical aggression at school;

showed behavior improvement during the course of training, which was
maintained beyond participation in the program;

showed a greater reduction in levels of physical aggression than
similar nontrained students who did not receive the training; and

had more than 50 percent fewer overall and violence-related juvenile
court charges and a lower per-person rate of offending than students
in a nontrained control group. 

Other signs of success include (1) principal and teacher observations
concerning improvements in the behavior of individual students
attributed to PACT and (2) student testimonials that PACT training
made a difference in how they acted. 


   MAJOR SUCCESS FACTORS
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4

PACT officials believe that the following key factors contribute to
the program's success: 

designing the program as a leadership club and providing a student
reward system,

using culturally sensitive videotapes that feature African-American
role models, and

using doctoral-level clinical psychology students as trainers. 


   IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:5

The PACT program overcame two major implementation barriers.  First,
PACT initially targeted a small group of chronically truant
adolescents at an alternative school-based dropout prevention
program.  Although these participants showed skill and behavior
improvements, the setting proved to be problematic.  For example, the
participants were often absent from school.  Consequently, absence
from PACT training was a major problem.  To address this issue, in
1990 the program relocated to the Roth Middle School where it
targeted a younger population.  Second, the program initially
operated as a pull-out model, with meeting times scheduled for the
same time as academic subjects.  Consequently, students missed some
regularly scheduled classes.  Since the program targeted high-risk
students who most likely were also experiencing academic problems,
this was of particular concern.  To overcome this barrier, PACT
violence-prevention training was made part of the regular curriculum
under the health education track. 


   FUNDING SOURCES
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:6

State, federal, and private sources provide funding for the PACT
program.  Funding to develop, test, evaluate, and disseminate program
information has come from a variety of sources, including the Ohio
Commission on Minority Health; the Ohio Governor's Office of Criminal
Justice Services; the Mathile Foundation; and the Bureau of Justice
Assistance, Department of Justice.  In addition, support for the
production of the PACT curriculum resource guide came from the
Department of Health and Human Services' Bureau of Maternal and Child
Health. 

At the school level, instituting the PACT program using doctoral-
level students as trainers costs approximately $55,200 per year or
about $287 per student.  If parent training is provided, the cost
increases by $23,400 to approximately $78,600 or about $409 per
student.  These estimates assume that the program serves 192
students.  Costs for program evaluation vary depending on the
complexity of the research design.  Current PACT evaluations cost
about $21,000 for a part-time evaluation consultant.

New York City's public school system is the largest in the country,
with 1,052 schools and nearly 1 million students.\14

The ethnically diverse student population citywide consisted of 37
percent African American, 36 percent Hispanic, 18 percent white, and
9 percent Asian/Pacific Islander for the 1992-93 school year. 
Fourteen percent of the students were limited English proficient and
69 percent were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. 

Officials are grappling with the increasing levels of urban crime and
violence that are invading their schools.  For the 1991-92 school
year, the New York Board of Education reported 4,955 serious
incidents in its schools, including homicide, robbery, sex offenses,
and controlled substance and weapons possession.  To increase the
level of school security, the board has responded by installing metal
detectors and X-ray machines and using student photo identification
cards in high schools.  The board has also funded conflict-resolution
and mediation programs and increased the number of school safety
officers in all schools.  The board employs about 3,000 security
officers.  If considered a police department, it would rank as the
ninth largest police department in the country, between the Baltimore
and Dade County Police Departments.  The budget for the Division of
School Safety, which includes security officers, 123 civilians and a
fleet of 90 vehicles, totaled nearly $73 million in 1993.  Also that
year, 95 percent of the schools had school safety officers and 41
high schools--or more than one-fourth of all high schools--had a
weapons-detection program. 


--------------------
\14 The Board of Education of the City of New York has oversight over
all the schools and direct responsibility for the high schools.  The
board selects superintendents to administer elementary and
intermediate/junior high schools in 32 separate community school
districts. 


   PROGRAM OVERVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix IV:2

RCCP is a school-based program in conflict-resolution and
intercultural understanding, jointly sponsored by the New York City
Board of Education and Educators for Social Responsibility (ESR). 
ESR is a nonprofit organization dedicated to conflict- resolution and
multicultural education.  RCCP began in 1985 as a collaboration
between ESR and the board to provide a model for an instructional
program in school change and violence-prevention. 

RCCP's objectives include modeling nonviolent alternatives for
dealing with conflict and teaching negotiation, as well as other
conflict-resolution skills.  RCCP focuses on changing the school
climate and requires a strong commitment at the highest levels within
the school system.  School districts then approach individual
principals and teachers about joining the program.  Participation at
every level is voluntary; school districts, principals, individual
teachers, and parents take part because they choose to do so.  RCCP
is in place in 180 elementary, intermediate/junior high and high
schools in New York City, with 3,000 teachers and 70,000 students
participating.\15 According to RCCP officials, most of the programs
serve at-risk students located in lower-income neighborhoods in
Brooklyn, South Bronx, Manhattan, and Queens. 

The K-12 curriculum focuses on violence-prevention, conflict
resolution, and countering bias.  RCCP curricula include the
following:  active listening, assertiveness (as opposed to
aggressiveness or passivity), expressing feelings,
perspective-taking, cooperation, negotiation, and interrupting bias. 
Teaching strategies include role-playing, interviewing, group
discussion, and brainstorming.  These teaching strategies require
teachers to adopt a new style of classroom management.  This method
involves a sharing of power with students so that they can learn to
deal with their own disputes.  To create this change, RCCP has an
intensive staff development component.  RCCP staff visit classrooms
and conduct one-on-one consultations, demonstration lessons, and
after-school meetings with teachers and administrators.  In addition,
RCCP's parent component teaches parents how to lead workshops for
other parents on intergroup relations, family communication, and
conflict resolution.  RCCP has an administrator's component also. 


--------------------
\15 Currently, RCCP is being disseminated in over 300 schools
nationwide under the auspices of the RCCP National Center. 


   PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND
   EVALUATION EFFORTS
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix IV:3

RCCP contracted with Metis Associates, Inc., a private consulting
group, to do an external evaluation for the 1988-1989 school year in
three community school districts.  The evaluation assessed the
various program components and measured the program's impact on
participating students, staff, and administrators.  To determine
RCCP's program impact, Metis Associates, Inc., primarily used
questionnaires to 200 participating teachers,\16 as well as various
school personnel and administrators; and administered achievement
tests to a sample of 176 participating students and a control group
of 219 nonparticipating students.  To determine the effectiveness of
the mediation program, Metis Associates, Inc., surveyed approximately
150 teachers, 11 school staff, and 143 student mediators in the five
schools using the program. 

Seventy-one percent of teachers responded that the program led to
less physical violence in the classroom and 67 percent observed less
name-calling and fewer verbal put-downs.  The test results of 4th,
5th, and 6th grade participants showed that they learned key concepts
of conflict resolution and could apply them in hypothetical
situations.  Over 98 percent of respondents in the five schools said
that the mediation component gave children an important tool for
dealing with conflicts. 

The Metis report concluded that RCCP was exemplary and that
participants' assessments were extremely positive.  The report cited
teacher's surveys that revealed a positive change in children's
attitudes and behaviors as a result of their participation in RCCP. 

In 1993, CDC awarded RCCP a 3-year grant to conduct an extensive
evaluation.  This evaluation will look at the impact of the program,
the readiness of teachers, and the importance of each program
component. 


--------------------
\16 Of the 200 teachers participating, about 130 or 65 percent
returned completed surveys.  For about 75 percent of the respondents,
1988-89 was their first year with RCCP. 


   MAJOR SUCCESS FACTORS
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix IV:4

RCCP officials believe the following key factors contribute to the
program's success: 

an on-going long-term commitment with the school district,

strong support of the principal and school administrators, and

partnerships with parents and the community. 


   IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix IV:5

RCCP officials stated that the major barrier they encountered was
struggling to work within a culture that glamorizes violent responses
to conflict.  RCCP bases its program on the premise that human
aggression is a learned behavior and that conflict itself is a normal
part of life.  According to RCCP officials, what must change,
therefore, is how students respond to conflict.  RCCP teaches
students that violence is not an acceptable means of resolving
conflict, that they can learn new nonviolent skills, and that they
have a choice to make when a conflict arises. 


   FUNDING SOURCES
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix IV:6

Sponsoring school districts and foundation grants fund RCCP
operations.  For the 1992-93 school year, the budget for the New York
City RCCP program was about $2 million.  The board funded staff
salaries and teacher stipends in the amount of $700,000.  ESR was
responsible for $1.3 million, with $750,000 from contracts with the
City's participating school districts and $550,000 raised from
private sources.  As mentioned earlier, CDC has funded a 3-year
evaluation of the RCCP program, totaling approximately $729,000
($243,000 annually starting in 1993).

   DISTRICT PROFILE
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:1

The Paramount Unified School District encompasses 13 schools that had
an enrollment of 13,879 in the 1993-94 school year.  About 73 percent
of the student population is Latino and 14 percent is
African-American.  In the 1993-94 school year, 46 percent of the
students had limited English proficiency and about 60 percent
received free or reduced-price lunches. 

Most of the 30 expulsions in school year 1993-94 were for weapons
possession or assault and battery.  Although the district does not
compile the reasons for suspension, school officials estimate that
most of the 4,254 suspended days that year involved possession of
drugs, fighting, or defiance of authority.  Currently, the district
contracts for one armed, uniformed sheriff's deputy at the single
high school.  As of March 1994, because of racial tensions that had
erupted on campus, the school board was considering the purchase of
hand-held metal detectors for the high school. 


   PROGRAM OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2

ATGM seeks to reduce gang membership by teaching students the harmful
consequences of the gang lifestyle, how to not participate in it, and
how to choose positive alternatives.  The City Council, together with
the school district and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department,
recognized that recreation programs and law enforcement alone were
not enough to contain the growing gang problem in their community. 
The City of Paramount and the Paramount Unified School District
developed a partnership in 1982 and started ATGM.  The program bases
its approach on the belief that interest in gangs begins at a young
age and, therefore, the focus is on reaching children early. 

The ATGM program includes three parts:  an elementary school
curriculum, an intermediate school follow-up program, and
neighborhood meetings.  The elementary program includes a 2nd grade
curriculum, taught in 10 weekly 40-minute lessons and a 5th grade
curriculum, taught in 15 weekly 55-minute lessons.  The 7th grade
follow-up program consists of eight biweekly lessons.  These lessons
expand on the topics introduced in the elementary school curriculum,
such as peer pressure and drug abuse.  The program uses many guest
speakers and focuses on self-esteem, the consequences of a criminal
lifestyle, and higher education and career opportunities.  The ATGM
program includes all students in the 2nd, 5th, and 7th grades. 

Program officials consider the neighborhood meetings a major emphasis
of the ATGM program.  These efforts encourage parents to attend
meetings--held at schools, churches, parks, community centers and
private residences--to educate them about gangs.  These meetings,
which are bilingual (English/Spanish), also provide parents with
information, encouragement, and help in preventing their children
from joining gangs.  ATGM staff members hold an average of 50
neighborhood meetings each year.  An important part of these meetings
is the individual outreach and follow-up meetings with students and
their families.  ATGM staff members frequently meet one-on-one with
at-risk students who have been referred to them by teachers. 


   PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND
   EVALUATION EFFORTS
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3

City officials have conducted several evaluations of the ATGM program
over the years, which mainly used pre- and post-test questionnaires
of participants.  These studies showed that the ATGM program made a
difference in keeping children out of gangs.  For example, while some
5th grade students may have had neither positive nor negative
feelings toward gang membership before participating, after their
participation these same students tend to have a negative attitude
toward gangs.  According to ATGM staff members, ATGM made a
difference in keeping students out of gangs.  During a 4-year period,
officials gave several questionnaires to the original 1982-83 group
of 5th grade participants.  For example, in June 1984, officials
tested the original 5th grade group when they were in intermediate
school.  Of the 170 6th graders who previously participated in the
ATGM program, 90 percent responded positively when asked if the
program helped them to stay out of gangs. 

During the 1986-87 school year, ATGM officials tested a group of 9th
graders who were ATGM participants in the 5th grade.  Again, more
than 90 percent of these students said that they were staying out of
gangs.  In addition, in February 1993, program officials conducted a
different type of evaluation.  Working with the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department, city officials matched 3,612 names of ATGM
participants with a listing of identified gang members.  This match
identified 152 students, or 4 percent, as gang members, and 3,460
participants, or 96 percent, who were not. 


   MAJOR SUCCESS FACTORS
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:4

According to program officials, the key factors contributing to the
program's success include

presenting information on the consequences of being in a gang in a
factual, no-nonsense manner that allows students to come to their own
conclusions about whether joining a gang is a good choice;

reaching out to children and their families through home visitation
and parent meetings in the community;

exposing children to the program early in their lives--in the 2nd,
5th, and 7th grades;

incorporating the program sessions as part of the regular school
curriculum and conducting lessons in both Spanish and English;

using bilingual staff who are familiar with the community and are
sensitive to Latino culture; and

exposing children to positive role models and alternatives to the
gang lifestyle. 


   IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:5

When ATGM began about 13 years ago, the major barrier was the lack of
research, training, and materials about antigang programs, especially
for the Latino community.  Over the years, ATGM staff have developed
their own curriculum, through trial and error, and borrowed from
other prevention programs.  Program officials cite the lack of
bilingual audiovisual materials for both children and parents as a
continuing problem. 

Program and school officials cited the District's high transiency
rate of 33 percent\17 as a major problem.  Children who recently
moved to Paramount have not been exposed to the ATGM program.  A 1992
survey of Paramount high school students revealed that over one-half
(56 percent) did not attend elementary school in the district. 
Program officials speculated that many of transient students are
unable to develop strong ties to the school and are more likely to be
involved in gangs.  They believed that if area schools had similar
antigang programs, the problem would lessen.

   FUNDING SOURCES
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:6

Since its inception, Paramount has funded the ATGM program entirely
with its general fund.  For the 1992-93 school year, the program
budget was $150,000, which funded three neighborhood counselors and
supplies.

SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
========================================================= Appendix VII

To accomplish our objectives and further our understanding of key
issues, we interviewed acknowledged experts and federal agency
officials involved in violence-prevention programming and research. 
We also collaboratively sponsored a school safety symposium with
Harvard University's School of Public Health, which brought together
federal officials, program directors, and violence-prevention
researchers to discuss efforts to curb school violence. 

Based on this information, we compiled a listing of more than 250
violence-prevention programs.  From this listing, and after
considering the recommendations of violence-prevention experts, we
judgmentally selected four programs for site visits--two in
California and one each in Ohio and New York. 

Anaheim, California:  SMART,

Dayton, Ohio:  PACT,

New York, New York:  RCCP, and

Paramount, California:  ATGM. 

We selected these programs because they operated primarily in
schools, were located in different regions of the country, were
located in areas with nationally recognized violence problems, and
had completed evaluations showing initial signs of success in curbing
school violence. 

We then visited seven schools associated with these four programs. 
At each school, we gathered program information, including key
characteristics, success factors, implementation barriers, evaluation
outcomes, and funding sources.  In addition, we observed students
participating in the programs and interviewed program officials. 

To obtain student and teacher views on efforts to curb school
violence, we conducted 16 discussion groups--7 with teachers and 9
with students--at the seven schools.  The size of these groups
varied.  Generally, the teacher groups consisted of 4 to 9
participants, while the student groups ranged from 8 to 15
participants.  In total, 103 students and 35 teachers participated. 
Our discussion group results are descriptive, showing the range of
opinions expressed by participants. 

To identify the key characteristics associated with promising
violence-prevention programs we conducted a literature review.  In
addition, we held discussions with school safety and
violence-prevention experts and determined the key factors for
success at the programs we visited. 

Finally, to identify federally sponsored evaluations of
violence-prevention programs, we interviewed federal officials at the
Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Justice and
reviewed the 1994 Juvenile Delinquency Development Statements:  A
Report on Federal Programs.\18

We conducted our review between January 1994 and February 1995 in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

\18 This report lists federal programs that support the goals of the
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.  These programs
generally concern juvenile delinquency, prevention, treatment,
diversion, education, training, and research, including alcohol and
drug programs and programs to improve the juvenile justice system.

<font size="2">(Letter Report, 07/19/95, GAO/GGD-95-182).
<img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">

Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO examined the Defender Services
program, focusing on: (1) the causes of the program's increased workload
and costs; and (2) whether death penalty resource centers (DPRC) have
reduced the federal costs of representing indigent defendants in death
penalty cases.

GAO found that: (1) the Defender Services program represents individual
defendants rather than cases and during fiscal years (FY) 1990 through
1993 there was an average of 1.4 defendants per criminal case filed; (2)
the Defender Services program workload has grown and costs have
increased because the number of defendants have increased and the cases
have become more complex, resulting in more work for attorneys in each
case; (3) there was insufficient data to determine why overall program
costs doubled and DPRC costs tripled between FY 1990 and FY 1993; (4)
federal public defender and community defender organization
representations cost less than panel attorney representations, although
the cost advantage has gradually declined; and (5) death penalty
representations accounted for 0.6 percent of all panel attorney
representations closed in FY 1993, but accounted for 8.7 percent of all
panel attorney payments.

July 19, 1995

The Honorable Ernest F.  Hollings
Ranking Minority Member
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and
 State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies
Committee on Appropriations
United States Senate

Dear Senator Hollings: 

The Federal Defender Services program provides legal counsel for
eligible federal criminal defendants who are unable to pay for these
services themselves.  Between fiscal years 1990 and 1993, the
program's costs more than doubled from about $122 million to almost
$252 million.\1 During this same period, the number of Defender
Services representations closed rose 23 percent.  In federal district
courts the number of criminal cases filed rose less than 1 percent,
and the number of defendants grew about 3 percent.  At the same time,
the costs to operate Death Penalty Resource Centers (DPRCs)--whose
representations in federal courts are funded by grants from the
Defender Services program--almost tripled from about $6 million to
$18 million, and the number of DPRC representations more than doubled
from 491 to 1,014.\2 These centers were created in part to provide a
source of expertise and help to reduce or contain the costs of death
penalty representations.  You asked us to examine a number of aspects
of the Defender Services program, including the causes of the
program's increased workload\3 and costs (as measured by program
budget obligations) and whether the DPRCs have reduced the federal
costs of representing indigent defendants in death penalty cases. 

As we informed your office early in our evaluation, the
Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts (AOUSC) did not have
adequate data for us to evaluate the direct impact on program
workload and costs of factors that AOUSC had suggested as possible
causes of increases.  Moreover, the lack of comparable data for both
before and after the establishment of the DPRCs, including data on
the impact of changes in the complexity of death penalty litigation,
precluded meaningful assessment of whether the centers have reduced
or contained the costs of representing indigent defendants in death
penalty cases.  Therefore, as agreed, our objectives were to provide
information on (1) the reasons that Defender Services workload has
grown faster than district court criminal cases; (2) the data
available to assess the causes of increased Defender Services
workload and costs; (3) the comparative costs of representations
provided by federal defender organizations and by private attorneys
directly assigned by federal judges; (4) the additional costs of
paying higher standard hourly rates to private, court-appointed
attorneys in all or parts of 16 districts; (5) the comparative costs
of federally funded private attorney and DPRC death penalty
representations; and (6) the potential causes of increased DPRC
workload and costs.

\2 The Judicial Conference Committee on Defender Services has
recently changed the name of the DPRCs to Post-Conviction Defender
Organizations.  Throughout this report, we refer to them by their
former designation, DPRCs. 

\3 Throughout this report, we measure program workload in terms of
representations closed (see page 6 for more details). 


   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

The Criminal Justice Act of 1964\4 required the federal judiciary to
provide for the legal representation of eligible federal criminal
defendants who were financially unable to afford their own
attorneys.\5 In response, the federal judiciary created the Federal
Defender Services program.  In August 1993, AOUSC reported that about
85 percent of all criminal cases prosecuted in federal courts
required court- appointed legal counsel.  The Defender Services
Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States\6 provides
overall policy direction and guidance of the program, and the
Defender Services Division of AOUSC provides administrative and
program support. 

Legal services for eligible defendants in the nation's 94 federal
district courts and 12 circuit courts of appeals are provided through
a mixed system, which at the end of fiscal year 1994 included 45
Federal Public Defender Organizations (FPDs) serving 54 districts; 10
Community Defender Organizations (CDOs) serving 11 districts; and
private &quot;panel&quot; attorneys chosen from a list, or panel, maintained by
the district courts.  Together, FPDs and CDOs are generally referred
to as Federal Defender Organizations (FDOs).  As shown in table 1,
the number of FPDs and CDOs has gradually increased since 1990.  FPD
attorneys are federal employees; CDO attorneys are not.  CDOs are
private organizations funded by federal defender services grants. 
FPD and CDO attorneys are salaried; panel attorneys receive an hourly
rate for their services that varies by district.  Higher panel
attorney hourly rates are generally paid for death penalty cases in
all districts.  Panel attorneys generally provided all court-
appointed representations in the 29 districts that had neither a FPD
or CDO, and by statute panel attorneys must receive a &quot;substantial&quot;
number of representation appointments in districts with such
organizations.

To date, death penalty representations have generally been handled by
panel attorneys (including some pro bono representations)\7 or the
DPRCs.  Occasionally, FDOs have also been appointed in such cases.\8
At the end of fiscal year 1994 there were 20 DPRCs serving 50 federal
judicial districts.  The DPRCs are specialized CDOs that provide
legal services--through direct representation and/or consultation and
support services to panel attorneys--for persons appealing state
death penalty convictions and/or sentences.  The DPRCs are also
authorized to represent defendants in federal capital prosecutions
and in appeals of federal death penalty convictions.  Under the grant
agreement between each center and the Judicial Conference, use of
each DPRC's federal funds is to be limited to federal death penalty
habeas corpus\9 cases and the defense of those charged with capital
crimes in federal district courts.  A DPRC's nonfederal funds must be
used to support representations in state court proceedings.

\4 Public Law 88-455 (1964), codified at 18 U.S.C.  3006A. 

\5 In addition to financial requirements, eligibility for court-
appointed counsel is also dependent upon the offense with which the
defendant is charged.  For example, defendants charged with certain
misdemeanors are not provided court-appointed attorneys unless the
U.S.  Magistrate or the court determines that the interests of
justice require it. 

\6 The Judicial Conference is a group of federal judges, chaired by
the Chief Justice of the United States, who serve as the central
policymaking body for the federal court system. 

\7 In pro bono cases, attorneys represent defendants without cost as
a public service. 

\8 In late 1994, the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council approved a pilot
plan to establish a death penalty unit in the FPD for the Central
District of California to handle death penalty habeas corpus cases. 
The Council has sought Judicial Conference approval for this pilot
project. 

\9 Federal habeas corpus proceedings are civil proceedings in which
convicted persons raise a challenge in federal court to their
conviction and/or sentence on the grounds that they are in custody in
violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

Defender Services representations cannot be compared directly to
criminal case filings in district courts because Defender Services'
workload also includes representations, such as appeals (reported in
appellate court statistics) and habeas corpus proceedings (reported
in district court civil case statistics), that are not included in
district court criminal caseload statistics.  Moreover, Defender
Services represents individual defendants, not cases, and during
fiscal years 1990 through 1993 there was an average of 1.4 defendants
per criminal case filed. 

AOUSC has maintained that overall program workload has grown and
costs have increased because (1) criminal cases, especially drug
cases, now involve more defendants; (2) more defendants apply for and
receive court-appointed attorneys; (3) more defendants are being
tried in federal courts; and (4) the cases are more complex,
principally because of changes in federal sentencing guidelines and
mandatory minimum sentencing statutes,\10 resulting in more work for
attorneys on each case. 

While each of these factors may have had some effect, we were not
able to determine to what extent they individually or collectively
accounted for the doubling of the overall program costs or the
tripling of DPRC costs from fiscal years 1990 through 1993.  This is
because AOUSC collected little consistent, national empirical data
that could be used to make such determinations. 

The data available on the costs of representations by federal
defender organizations and panel attorneys were not precisely
comparable.  For example, FPD and CDO data included the costs of
training provided to panel attorneys.  Also, FPD and CDO cost data
were not available by type of case (such as appeals) or major
criminal offense category (such as drugs), but such data were
available for panel attorneys.  Nevertheless, prior studies by the
Judicial Conference and AOUSC and our analysis of available data
suggested that, overall, FPD and CDO attorney representations cost
less than panel attorney representations, although the cost advantage
has gradually declined. 

However, the average cost per representation closed can vary among
districts, among FPDs and CDOs, and from year to year depending upon
changes in the proportion of expensive cases in the total workload. 
In fiscal year 1993, for example, each panel attorney drug or fraud
representation (at an average cost of more than $3,000) had as much
impact on program costs as three immigration representations. 

The additional costs of paying higher standard hourly rates to panel
attorneys in the 16 districts authorized to pay such rates has been a
relatively small part of total panel attorney costs.  In 78 of the 94
districts, panel attorneys are paid a standard hourly rate of $40 for
each out-of-court hour and $60 for each in-court hour.\11 In 1986,
Congress authorized higher rates of up to $75 per hour for both
in-court and out-of-court hours in specific circuits or districts, if
the Judicial Conference determined it was justified.  As of March
1995, the Judicial Conference had approved higher standard rates for
89 districts.  However, the Judicial Conference, at congressional
direction, has limited actual payment of the higher rates--$60, $70,
or $75 for both in-court and out-of-court hours--to all or parts of
only 16 districts.  We estimated (on the basis of available data)
that the additional cost of paying these higher standard hourly rates
from fiscal years 1991 through 1993 was at least $33.5 million, about
10.2 percent of total panel attorney obligations during the period. 
Our estimate excluded most appeals representations because the AOUSC
database did not designate the district of origin for at least 85
percent of all appeals representations. 

Death penalty representations have been expensive relative to other
types of Defender Services representations.  In 1993, the average
DPRC cost per representation\12 was about $17,200 and the average
panel attorney cost per representation closed was about $37,000.\13
The 246 panel attorney death penalty representations closed in fiscal
year 1993 were 0.6 percent of all panel attorney representations
closed, but they accounted for 8.7 percent of the $104.3 million in
1993 panel attorney payments approved by the courts.  Because of
missing data, we could not compare costs in districts with and
without DPRCs to determine if panel attorney death penalty
representations were less expensive in districts with DPRCs, or
whether the cost per representation had grown less in districts with
DPRCs. 

According to Defender Services officials, DPRC costs have increased
because more DPRCs have been created, more death penalty cases are in
the courts, and the cases are becoming more complex.  The number of
DPRCs increased from 14 in fiscal year 1989 to 20 in 1994.  The
number of DPRC death penalty cases also increased from 313 to 1,086,
but data on case complexity were limited. 

AOUSC has embarked on a number of initiatives to address the data
deficiencies identified in this report and to improve the information
provided to Congress for appropriations and oversight. 


--------------------
\10 By statute, a minimum prison sentence must be imposed for certain
offenses when the statutorily specified criteria have been met. 

\11 This basic statutory rate has not increased since 1984. 

\12 DPRC costs per representation include the cost of all cases
during the year, including cases pending at the end of the year. 

\13 According to AOUSC, death penalty representations are more likely
than other types of representations to extend over 2 fiscal years or
more.  Thus, the total cost of death penalty representations may be
more than we report, since our cost is based on the total of all
vouchers approved for payment in a single fiscal year. 


   SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

To meet our objectives, we reviewed prior studies by the Judicial
Conference, AOUSC, and consultants.  We met with federal judges and
AOUSC officials, members of AOUSC's Defender Services Advisory Group,
defender services attorneys, and other officials in six judgmentally
selected judicial districts.  To try to identify potential causes of
workload and cost increases and to compare FDO and panel attorney
costs per representation, we reviewed previous analyses and available
AOUSC data on FDO and panel attorney workload and costs. 

For FDOs, AOUSC provided data for fiscal years 1990 through the first
6 months of 1994 on type of representation; type of disposition;
representations opened, closed, and pending; and in-court hours per
representation closed.  For the same period, we analyzed the panel
attorney voucher automated database, which included data by type of
representation and criminal offense on (1) total in-court and
out-of-court compensation requested and approved, and (2) the
in-court and out-of-court hourly rates paid for representations in
which the panel attorney had requested payment.  To provide
comparable workload data for FPDs, CDOs, and panel attorneys, we used
representations closed because this was the only workload measure
available for panel attorneys. 

Although we did not verify the accuracy of the data we received, we
did some edit checks and a distributional analysis of the data, which
raised questions about the accuracy of some of the data in the panel
attorney database, including the hourly rates recorded in the
database.  We have qualified our conclusions to take this possibility
of error into account. 

We also used data from AOUSC's master criminal file database and
other sources to determine total district court criminal workload and
to try to assess the impact of such variables as the number of trials
on Defender Services workload.  Our analysis of data on criminal
trials and cases with multiple defendants used data on total district
court workload because the database did not reliably identify that
subset of cases in which defendants had court-appointed attorneys. 
This limitation is noted in our analysis and conclusions.  Certain
information, including data on cases involving mandatory minimum
sentences and federal prosecutions of state-developed cases, was
either unavailable or too incomplete for analysis.  Also, because
data reported by FDOs and panel attorneys differed, workload and cost
comparisons between the two were limited. 

To determine the additional costs of paying panel attorneys the
higher standard hourly rates, we used AOUSC's database to calculate
the difference in compensation at the higher and lower standard
hourly rates.  We calculated the in-court and out-of-court
compensation approved for those representations in the 16 districts
compensated at the higher standard hourly rates.  We then estimated
the in-court and out-of-court compensation that would have been
requested at the lower standard hourly rates of $40 out-of-court and
$60 in-court.  We subtracted the lower rate estimate from the actual
amounts approved for payment at the higher standard rates.  The
difference was the estimated additional costs of paying the higher
standard rates.  As explained in more detail in appendix I, this
produced a conservative estimate of the additional costs of paying
the higher standard hourly rates in the 16 districts. 

We used DPRC quarterly reports for fiscal years 1990 through the
first half of 1994 to examine trends in DPRC workload and costs. 
However, due to data limitations we could not fully assess whether
DPRCs had lowered the costs of death penalty representations. 

The Defender Services program has been reviewed by various sources,
and where appropriate we have incorporated the results of these
studies into our work.  To determine what actions the Judiciary has
underway to improve Defender Services program data and analyses and
to control costs, we obtained copies of AOUSC and Judicial Conference
reports, directives, and other documents addressing these issues, and
we talked to AOUSC officials. 

We did our work primarily in Washington, D.C.; New York; and Detroit,
between April 1993 and February 1995 in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards.  Our objectives, scope, and
methodology are discussed in greater detail in appendix I.  AOUSC
provided written comments on a draft of this report, which are
discussed on pages 28-29 and printed in full in appendix III. 


   DEFENDER SERVICES
   REPRESENTATIONS ARE NOT
   SYNONYMOUS WITH DISTRICT COURT
   CRIMINAL FILINGS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

Data on Defender Services representations are not fully comparable to
district court criminal filings or terminations (case closings).  In
fiscal year 1993, 46,786 criminal cases involving 65,653 defendants
were filed in federal district courts.\14 In the same year, district
courts closed (disposed) 44,800 cases involving 64,048 defendants. 
Since Defender Services represents defendants, not cases, the
district court defendant data are more appropriate than case data in
comparing district court and Defender Services workloads. 

Defender Services attorneys closed 78,016 representations in fiscal
year 1993, which was 13,968 more than the number of defendants
reported as disposed in district courts.  Of this additional Defender
Services workload, at least 9,478 representations (about 68 percent)
were not reported in district court criminal workload statistics. 
The Defender Services 1993 workload, for example, included 6,126
appeals, reported in appellate court statistics; 1,028 habeas corpus
proceedings, reported in district court civil statistics; and 2,324
bail proceedings, which Defender Services reported as a separate
workload category, but district courts did not. 

Criminal representations appeared to be the category of Defender
Services representations most comparable to district court criminal
workload.  In fiscal year 1993, Defender Services closed 54,907
criminal representations, or 9,141 less than the 64,048 criminal
defendants disposed in federal district courts in 1993.  The 9,141
additional defendants reported in district court statistics may have
paid for their own attorneys rather than having court-appointed
attorneys.  However, we found no consistent data on the number of
defendants in federal courts who received court-appointed attorneys. 


--------------------
\14 Totals include traffic cases and defendants as well as transfers
between districts.  Traffic cases in federal courts arise from
traffic violations on federal property. 


   TOTAL DEFENDER SERVICES
   REPRESENTATIONS CLOSED, TOTAL
   BUDGET OBLIGATIONS, AND COSTS
   PER REPRESENTATION CLOSED HAVE
   GROWN
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

Defender Services appropriations, obligations, representations
closed, and costs per representation closed have generally grown in
recent years.  As shown in table 2, from fiscal years 1990 through
1994, total budget obligations grew about 118 percent from $122.5
million to $266.7 million.\15 According to AOUSC, the growth in
representations closed and obligations was less in fiscal year 1994
than in recent years, but it was not clear at the time whether this
was the beginning of a long-term trend or a short-term phenomenon. 
The Judiciary initially requested $387 million for fiscal year 1994,
which included $14 million to extend the standard higher panel
attorney rates beyond the 16 districts in which they were being paid. 
Congress rejected this expansion and appropriated $280 million for
fiscal year 1994.  Defender Services requested $290.3 million for
fiscal year 1995, an increase of 3.7 percent.  Congress appropriated
$250 million for fiscal year 1995.\16 The Judiciary has requested
$295.8 million for fiscal year 1996--an increase of 18 percent over
the 1995 appropriation and 1.9 percent more than the 1995 budget
request.

\15 The Defender Services program costs cited in this report exclude
AOUSC costs, such as the operations of the Defender Services Division
and processing panel attorney payments.  Also excluded are district
and courts of appeals costs for reviewing and approving panel
attorney vouchers; such costs are included in local court budgets. 
An AOUSC analysis estimated such annual administrative costs at
$10.68 million in fiscal year 1992. 

\16 Defender Services funds are available until expended.  In
addition to its fiscal year 1995 appropriation, Defender Services had
available $36.5 million in unobligated appropriations from prior
years to apply to its fiscal year 1995 expenses. 


      OVERALL CHANGE IN NUMBER OF
      REPRESENTATIONS CLOSED AND
      COSTS FOR PANEL ATTORNEYS
      AND DEFENDER ORGANIZATIONS
      VARIED
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1

As shown in figure 1, from fiscal years 1990 to 1993 growth in the
number of representations closed, total obligations, and the average
cost per representation closed\17 for panel attorneys, FPDs, and CDOs
varied.  To provide comparable data for defender organizations and
panel attorneys, our workload figures are based on representations
closed, because data for ongoing representations were not available
for panel attorneys (see app.  I).  While panel attorney workload
grew more than that of FPDs or CDOs, panel attorney costs per
representation closed grew less than FPDs or CDOs.  Compensation
approved for panel attorney fees grew about 88 percent, while total
panel attorney budget obligations--a figure an AOUSC official told us
included payments for investigators and experts in addition to
attorney fees--grew about 96 percent during the period.

   Total Representations Closed,
   Budget Obligations, and Average

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Note:  Growth in panel attorney budget obligations excluding death
penalty representations was based on total panel attorney obligations
less attorney fees in death penalty representations.  We did not have
data on nonattorney fee costs, such as transcripts and investigators,
in death penalty representations. 

Source:  GAO analysis of AOUSC data. 


--------------------
\17 Cost per representation closed for FPDs and CDOs was determined
by dividing total budget obligations for these organizations in each
fiscal year by the total number of representations closed.  Cost per
representation closed for panel attorneys was determined by dividing
the total amount of attorney compensation approved for payment in
each fiscal year by the number of representations closed. 


   REPRESENTATIONS CLOSED FOR
   FPDS, CDOS, AND PANEL ATTORNEYS
   INCREASED
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6

Defender Services representations closed annually increased by about
23 percent from 63,504 to 78,016 between fiscal years 1990 and 1993. 
Of this total, panel attorney representations closed increased about
33 percent from 28,575 to 38,005, or about twice as fast as FDOs'
workload, which increased from 34,929 to 40,011, about 15 percent. 
Within this FDO total, FPD representations closed grew 28 percent and
CDO representations closed declined 12 percent.  Most of the CDO
decline was due to a drop in immigration representations closed at
the CDO in the Southern District of California.  Excluding this
district's workload, CDO representations closed declined about 5.5
percent.  Although still a very small percentage of total panel
attorney workload (less than 1 percent), panel attorney death penalty
representations closed grew from 9 to 246.  (More detail is found in
the tables in app.  II.)

As shown in figure 2, from fiscal years 1990 through 1993 criminal
representations closed were by far the largest proportion of total
representations closed for both FDOs and panel attorneys, followed by
&quot;other&quot; and appeals.  The number of FDO and panel attorney criminal
representations was about even in fiscal year 1990, but FDO criminal
representations increased 8 percent during the period while panel
attorney criminal representations increased almost 23 percent. 
Consequently, by 1993 panel attorney criminal representations closed
exceeded those of FDOs by 3,567.  The growth in panel attorney
appeals representations closed (118 percent) was also greater than
that for FDOs (54 percent).  From fiscal years 1991 through 1993,
panel attorneys closed at least 75 percent more appeals
representations each year than did FDOs.  On the other hand, the
number of FDO &quot;other&quot; representations closed was more than twice that
of panel attorneys each year for 1990 through 1993, reflecting the
much higher number of bail and probation/parole revocation
proceedings handled by FPDs and CDOs.

We disaggregated criminal representations closed into five major
offense categories--weapons, immigration, drugs, fraud, and other--to
examine changes in representations closed by type of offense and type
of Defender Services attorneys.  As shown in figure 3, within each
major offense category, FPDs, CDOs, and panel attorneys had different
growth rates.  For some offenses there were fewer representations
closed in 1993 than in 1990.  However, we could not determine the
reasons for the variations shown in figure 3.

   DETERMINING THE CAUSES OF
   DEFENDER SERVICES COST GROWTH
   IS DIFFICULT
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7

Changes in Defender Services costs are basically the result of two
factors--changes in the number of representations combined with
changes in the average cost of each representation.  If the number of
representations increases, program costs will also increase even if
the average cost per representation remains unchanged.  Conversely,
costs will rise if the cost per representation increases, even though
the number of representations remains unchanged. 


      ESTIMATED IMPACT OF
      INCREASED REPRESENTATIONS
      CLOSED ON PROGRAM COSTS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.1

To determine the impact of increased workload from fiscal years 1990
through 1993--as measured by representations closed--on fiscal year
1993 FPD, CDO, and panel attorney costs,\18 we estimated what fiscal
year 1993 costs would have been if the average cost per
representation closed in 1993 were the same as the 1990 average cost
(unadjusted for inflation).\19 As shown in figure 4, about 26 percent
of the increase in FPD costs and 38 percent of the increase in panel
attorney costs between fiscal years 1990 and 1993 could be attributed
to the increase in representations closed in 1993.  However, CDO
representations closed declined from 11,706 in 1990 to 10,299 in
1993; consequently, none of the increase in CDO costs could be
attributed to increased representations closed.\20

   the Total Increase in FPD, CDO,
   and Panel Attorney Costs

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Note:  Workload was measured by representations closed. 

Source:  GAO analysis of AOUSC data. 

However, as the panel attorney data in figures 5 and 6 indicate,
these overall estimates can mask considerable variation by type of
representation.\21 For some types of panel attorney representations
closed--appeals, other, death penalty--from about 69 to 92 percent of
the increase in costs could be attributed to increased numbers of
representations closed (fig.  5).  Within criminal representations,
increased representations closed accounted for more than half of the
increase in the costs of weapons, drugs, and fraud representations
closed, but they accounted for only about 13 percent of the increase
in the costs of immigration representations closed (see fig.  6). 
Other criminal representations closed declined 7 percent between
fiscal years 1990 and 1993.  Thus, all of the increase in costs for
these representations must have been the result of factors that have
increased the average cost per representation closed.  As discussed
later in this report, Defender Services officials and AOUSC have
suggested a number of factors, such as the sentencing guidelines and
a higher number of defendants charged with mandatory minimum
offenses, that could have contributed to higher average costs per
representation closed.

--------------------
\18 Costs for FPDs and CDOs are based on total obligations each
fiscal year divided by the number of representations closed.  Because
we could not separately identify those costs associated with FPD and
CDO representations closed, our average cost per representation
closed included the cost of all representations during the fiscal
year--new, closed, and pending at the end of the fiscal year--as well
as the costs of training provided for panel attorneys.  Panel
attorney cost data reflect only the costs of attorney fees for those
representations for which panel attorneys have requested payment. 
Panel attorney costs exclude such costs as transcripts,
psychiatrists, or investigators--costs that are included in FPD and
CDO budgets, and, thus, FPD and CDO cost per representation.  (See
app I.)

\19 For reasons described more fully in appendix I, our 1993
estimates are based on 1990 costs per representation, unadjusted for
inflation.  The result may somewhat underestimate the impact of
increased representations closed on program costs, especially for
FPDs and CDOs. 

\20 The percentage of increased costs attributed to factors other
than increased representations closed is the difference between 100
percent and the percent of increased costs attributed to increased
representations closed.  For panel attorneys, for example, we assumed
about 62 percent (100 percent minus 38 percent) of total increased
costs were the result of factors other than increased representations
closed. 

\21 Data limitations precluded a similar analysis for FPDs and CDOs. 


      COST PER REPRESENTATION
      CLOSED HAS GROWN FOR ALL
      TYPES OF DEFENDER SERVICES
      ATTORNEYS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.2

For each fiscal year 1990 through 1993, panel attorney costs per
representation closed were the highest and CDO costs the lowest.\22
(See fig.  7.) Costs per representation closed for all three types of
Defender Services attorneys increased each year.  Although CDOs still
had the lowest cost per representation in 1993), the 134-percent
growth in CDO costs per representation had narrowed the gap between
CDOs and the other two types of attorneys.  In 1990, the FPD cost per
representation closed was about $300 lower than that of panel
attorneys.  By 1993, the cost advantage had narrowed to about $100
per representation closed.  However, if the average panel attorney
cost per representation is calculated excluding death penalty
representations, FPD average cost per representation closed in fiscal
year 1993 was about $130 more than the panel attorney average. 
Including death penalty representations in calculating the overall
panel attorney average cost per representation added about $10 per
representation closed in fiscal year 1990 and about $223 in fiscal
year 1993.

   Representation Closed for FPDs,
   CDOs, and Panel Attorneys,

   edition.)

Note:  Actual costs for this figure are shown in appendix II, table
II.6. 

Source:  GAO analysis of AOUSC data. 

One possible reason for the generally higher panel attorney cost per
representation closed may be the higher average number of panel
attorney in-court hours per representation closed (see fig.  8).  We
could not determine why panel attorneys apparently expended more
in-court hours per representation closed than did FPDs and CDOs. 
However, these additional in-court hours can affect program costs. 
In 78 of the 94 districts the hourly rate for in-court hours is $20
more than the rate for out-of-court hours.

representation data in this section include San Diego. 


      LIMITED DATA WERE AVAILABLE
      TO VERIFY THE POTENTIAL
      CAUSES OF INCREASED COSTS
      PER REPRESENTATION CLOSED
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.3

Overall, between fiscal years 1990 and 1993, we estimated that
factors other than increased representations closed accounted for
about 74 percent of FPD cost growth, 62 percent of panel attorney
growth, and 100 percent of CDO cost growth.  Defender Services
officials and Judicial Conference and AOUSC studies offered a number
of reasons why the cost per representation closed had steadily
increased for FPDs, CDOs, and panel attorneys.  These reasons
included implementation of the federal sentencing guidelines, which
require additional attorney time; changing prosecutorial priorities
that increased the number of complex drug and multiple defendant
cases prosecuted in federal court, which were more likely to result
in trials for one or more defendants; and greater numbers of offenses
carrying mandatory minimum sentences, which were more likely to
result in trials. 

These arguments were supported by some anecdotal evidence and such
aggregate empirical data as total district court criminal caseload
statistics showing a rising number of criminal trials and multiple
defendant cases.  However, it was difficult to document that the
reasons cited were in fact the major contributing factors to rising
workload and/or costs.  This was largely due to the absence of
consistent, reliable data on such potential causes of rising program
costs as the number of Defender Services cases involving multiple
defendants or defendants charged with mandatory minimum offenses; the
percentage of such cases that go to trial; or the number of cases
investigated and developed by state agencies and handed off to
federal prosecutors because federal law and the sentencing guidelines
provided longer sentences.  A more detailed analysis of the data
sources available to measure the impact of these factors is included
in appendix I. 

As discussed in the following sections, there is some evidence that
certain of these factors may have affected program costs. 


         IMPACT OF SENTENCING
         GUIDELINES
-------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.3.1

Recent Defender Services budget submissions have noted that the
federal sentencing guidelines, which became effective November 1,
1987,\23 &quot;have profoundly altered the nature of the sentencing
process and dramatically increased federal and panel attorney
workloads.&quot; Contributing to the impact on both attorney workload and
program costs has been the need to consider the accuracy of all facts
in the judicial proceedings that could affect the potential sentence
under the guidelines; the many guidelines amendments (434 between
November 1987 and November 1991, for example); the increasing
complexity of the guidelines; more defendants choosing to go to trial
under the guidelines; and the increased number of sentencing appeals. 

Our August 1992 sentencing guidelines report\24 concluded that
although empirical data and reliable work measurements did not exist,
available statistics and our interviews suggested that the guidelines
had apparently increased criminal justice workload.  Though Defender
Services estimated that the sentencing guidelines implementation had
increased the time required to provide representation by about 25 to
50 percent in most cases, AOUSC officials could not provide data to
substantiate this observation. 

In addition, subsequent to the sentencing guidelines implementation,
there has been a rise in criminal appeals.  The authorizing
legislation for the sentencing guidelines, the Sentencing Reform Act
of 1984, provided for appeals of sentences imposed by U.S.  District
Courts.  For example, the act provided that a defendant or the
federal government may appeal a sentence on the basis that the
sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the
guidelines.  Generally, appeals of sentences were not common prior to
the Sentencing Reform Act's appellate review provisions.  There were
2,534 such sentencing appeals in fiscal year 1992, or almost 23
percent of all criminal appeals.  Defender Services appeals
representations closed more than doubled from about 3,300 in 1987 to
over 6,700 in 1993, but we could not determine how much of this
increase was attributable to appeals of sentence only. 

The increase in the number of appeals and cost per appeals
representation closed has affected program costs.  From fiscal years
1990 through 1993, the cost per panel attorney appeals representation
closed rose 24 percent from $2,567 to $3,187,\25 while the number of
such appeals rose 118 percent from 1,825 to 3,977.  During the
period, the cost per panel attorney appeals representation closed was
at least 20 percent more than criminal representations closed and
more than twice as much as &quot;other&quot; representations closed. 


--------------------
\23 The guidelines apply to all federal criminal offenses committed
on or after November 1, 1987.  However, the guidelines were not
implemented nationally until after January 1989, when a U.S.  Supreme
Court decision upheld their constitutionality.  Mistretta v.  United
States, 488 U.S.  361 (1989). 

\24 Sentencing Guidelines:  Central Questions Remain Unanswered
(GAO/GGD 92-93, Aug.  14, 1992). 

\25 Data to calculate the cost of FPD or CDO appeals representations
closed were not available. 


         NUMBER AND LENGTH OF
         TRIALS CAN AFFECT COSTS
-------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.3.2

The number and length of criminal trials can also affect program
costs.  The fiscal year 1994 Defender Services congressional budget
submission noted that the number of trials had increased,
particularly for defendants in multiple defendant cases or those
charged with offenses requiring a mandatory minimum prison term upon
conviction.  Although specific data on trials involving defendants
represented by Defender Service attorneys were not available, we did
review general AOUSC statistical data on overall trial trends.\26

The number of criminal jury trials increased more than total criminal
trials (9.5 percent versus 2.9 percent) between statistical years
1990 and 1993.  Jury trials with 4 or more defendants increased about
15 percent (from 425 to 488) during the same period, though they
tended to be a small and stable percentage (between 8.4 and 8.8
percent) of total jury trials.  Longer criminal jury trials, those
requiring 6 to 10 or 11 to 20 days, increased 22.9 and 17.3 percent,
respectively, between 1990 and 1993.\27 But such trials have remained
fairly constant as a percent of criminal jury trials.  The number of
trials lasting 20 days or more has fluctuated by both district and
criminal offense. 

The in-court hours recorded by FPDs, CDOs, and panel attorneys can be
one rough measure of trial time for Defender Services attorneys. 
While average in-court time from fiscal years 1990 through 1993 has
generally increased for FPDs, CDOs, and panel attorneys, no clear
pattern emerged.  For example, while average number of in-court hours
for FPDs and CDOs in drug offense representations closed generally
increased, it generally declined for panel attorneys.  In average
hours per representation closed, the largest increase for panel
attorneys was for fraud offenses (from an average of 7 to 11 hours);
the largest for FPDs was fraud offenses (3.2 to 4.6); and the largest
for CDOs was for &quot;other&quot; offenses (2.1 to 4.3).  Panel attorneys
consistently reported more in-court hours for all types of
representations than did FPDs or CDOs, but we could not determine why
this was so. 

Fiscal year 1993 data from the CDO for the Southern District of
California in San Diego provided some indication that representations
for defendants who had been charged with an offense carrying a
mandatory minimum prison term were more likely to be disposed of by
trial than other criminal representations.  However, the CDO's
attorneys spent about the same amount of in-court and out-of-court
time on trials that did and did not involve defendants charged with
mandatory minimum offenses.  The San Diego data indicated that
attorneys spent more time negotiating guilty pleas in multiple
defendant drug cases that involved mandatory minimums than in
multiple defendant drug cases that did not. 


--------------------
\26 AOUSC provided trial data by statistical year (July 1 to June
30).  AOUSC's trial database defines a trial as any contested
proceeding before a judge at which evidence is introduced. 

\27 Trials lasting 6 to 10 days rose from 607 to 746.  Trials lasting
11 to 20 days rose from 214 to 251. 


         PROSECUTORIAL ACTIVITIES
         AND OTHER FACTORS
-------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.3.3

The Judiciary also has stated that workload and costs of Defender
Service attorneys in federal criminal cases have increased as a
result of Justice Department prosecutorial initiatives, such as the
organized crime and drug enforcement task forces.  Although specific
data were not available, the Judiciary pointed out that these
investigations often lead to cases that can be rather complex and
expensive to prosecute and defend. 

Operation Weed and Seed is a multiple agency approach to combatting
violent crime, drugs, and gangs in high-crime areas.  Project
Triggerlock targets dangerous, repeat offenders for prosecution in
federal court as opposed to state court to take advantage of federal
mandatory minimum penalties for firearms offenses.  According to the
Judiciary, both initiatives have increased the complexity of cases
and the subsequent costs of Defender Services attorneys.  However,
the courts do not maintain detailed data on the number of criminal
cases resulting from these initiatives.  Our analysis showed that
from fiscal years 1990 through 1993, the number of weapons
representations closed\28 by Defender Services attorneys increased by
75 percent to 3,279.  Data were not available to determine how many
of these resulted from Operation Triggerlock investigations and/or
carried mandatory minimum sentences. 

Various sources have also cited the growing number of multiple
defendant cases as a major contributor to increased program costs. 
Multiple defendant cases can be more complex and time-consuming than
other cases, particularly when they involve sophisticated drug
trafficking organizations.  Conflict of interest concerns have led
FPDs and CDOs generally to represent only one defendant in multiple
defendant cases.  The remaining defendants are generally represented
by panel attorneys, whom our analysis and that of AOUSC showed were,
overall, more costly per representation closed than FPD and CDO
lawyers. 

Statistics were not available on the number of representations by
Defender Services attorneys in multiple defendant cases.  However,
AOUSC does maintain national data on multiple defendant cases.  These
data showed that the number of multiple defendant cases increased by
about 9 percent between statistical years 1990 and 1993 to about
8,100.  However, as a percent of all criminal cases, multiple
defendant cases remained fairly constant (between about 19 and 20
percent).  The total number of multiple defendant drug cases also
increased; cases involving two to five defendants accounted for most
of the increase.  In 1992 almost 4,000 cases, or 36 percent of all
drug cases, involved multiple defendants.  However, there were no
reliable data available showing multiple defendant drug cases by type
of counsel. 

The number of Defender Services representations closed for drug
offenses increased by 39 percent from 15,271 to 21,270 between fiscal
years 1990 and 1993.  Drug representations closed were 43 percent of
all panel attorney criminal representations closed during the period
and, excluding death penalty representations closed, generally were
the most costly, rising about 18 percent to an average of $3,152 in
fiscal year 1993.\29 Similar cost data were not available for FDOs. 


--------------------
\28 This is a representation in which the defendant is charged with a
federal firearms violation, such as the use or possession of a
firearm during commission of a felony. 

\29 By 1993 the average cost of fraud representations was $3,394,
more than that for drug representations.  However, fraud
representations were less than 10 percent of all panel attorney
criminal representations in 1993 and, thus, had a much smaller impact
on program costs than drug representations. 


   THE COSTS OF PAYING HIGHER
   HOURLY RATES IN 16 DISTRICTS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8

The current standard panel attorney rates of $40 for each
out-of-court hour and $60 for each in-court hour were set in 1984. 
On the basis of its assessment of such factors as attorney
compensation and expenses, the Judicial Conference has approved
higher rates in 89 districts (as of March 1995).  However, at
congressional direction, the Judicial Conference has limited the
actual payment of higher standard rates--a single rate of $60, $70,
or $75 per hour for both in-court and out-of-court hours--to all or
parts of the 16 districts for which the higher standard rates were
approved in January 1990. 

Had the Judiciary paid the full amount panel attorneys requested in
these 16 districts during fiscal years 1991 through 1993, the
additional costs of paying the higher rates would have been about
$40.4 million, about 12 percent of total panel attorney obligations
during the period.  However, with some regularity judges approved
less than the total compensation requested.  Based on the amounts
judges approved for payment, a more accurate measure, the additional
costs were about $33.5 million, or about 10.2 percent of total panel
attorney obligations during the period. 

Because they exclude virtually all appeals representations, these
estimates probably underestimate the additional costs.  Appeals were
excluded because virtually all appeals representations in the
database--at least 98 percent in each year for 1990 through 1993 and
85 percent in the first 6 months of 1994--were identified only by the
appeals circuit and, thus, could not be associated with a specific
district (see app.  I).  Because the jurisdictions of 11 of the 12
circuit courts of appeals cover several states and a number of
districts, we could not use the circuit identifier for our analysis
in 11 of the 12 circuits. 


   DATA LIMITATIONS PRECLUDED FULL
   ASSESSMENT OF INCREASE IN DPRC
   WORKLOAD AND COSTS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :9

DPRCs were created in part to help reduce or contain the cost of
death penalty representations.  Budget requests and appropriations
for the centers have increased sharply since the establishment of the
first one in 1988.  From fiscal years 1989 to 1994 the number of
centers increased from 14 to 20, and the amounts appropriated for the
centers more than tripled, from $5,890,000 to $19,800,000.\30 During
the period, the overall cost per case increased from $9,521 to
$17,247, up about 81 percent (in current dollars).  (See table 3.)

Source:  Judiciary's fiscal year 1996 Congressional Budget
Justifications for Defender Services (DPRC data) and other AOUSC data
(panel attorneys). 

AOUSC offered three major reasons for the increases in total costs
and costs per representation:  more operational centers, increased
caseload, and increased complexity of death penalty litigation. 
While the number of death penalty cases in federal courts has
increased, the lack of a reliable death penalty identifier in the
database precluded an accurate measure of the increase.  Almost all
death penalty cases in federal courts arise from state death penalty
convictions.  Between the end of calendar years 1989 and 1993, the
total number of persons sentenced to death, including those convicted
and sentenced in state courts, rose from 2,186 to 2,785.  As of March
1995, only 6 persons had been convicted and sentenced to death in
federal courts. 

AOUSC asserted that the services provided by the centers actually
lower federal death penalty litigation costs by

  encouraging competent private attorneys to immediately accept death
     penalty cases;

  providing consultation, investigative, and other services to
     private attorneys; and

  using expert, salaried center attorneys to directly represent
     defendants/prisoners. 

Due to data limitations, we could not fully assess the validity of
these assertions.  Comparable empirical data on case complexity and
reliable baseline data concerning death penalty litigation costs
prior to implementation of the resource centers were not available,
and much of the available cost information was anecdotal.  Our
analysis of aggregate data from quarterly reports was limited because
(1) comparable reports were available only for fiscal years 1991,
1992, and 1993; (2) the 1992 and 1993 reports included centers not
operational in 1991; and (3) complete data were not available from
all operational centers.  These data limitations in turn precluded a
full assessment of the costs of death penalty litigation. 

The absence of a reliable district identifier in panel attorney death
penalty representations precluded a cost comparison of such
representations in districts with and without DPRCs to determine if
the costs were less in districts with DPRCs. 


--------------------
\30 The fiscal year 1994 appropriation was $265,000 less than the
1993 appropriation of $20,065,000.  The fiscal year 1994 request was
$30,559,000. 


   EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PROGRAM DATA
   AND OPERATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :10

In its fiscal year 1995 congressional budget submission, the
Judiciary acknowledged that it did not have sufficient data or
analyses to explain the causes of increased panel attorney costs and
announced steps to improve Defender Services program operations,
enhance data collection and analysis, and reduce costs.  According to
AOUSC officials, many of these initiatives were undertaken in
response to congressional concerns and/or our inquiries.  Several
were recommended by the Economy Subcommittee of the Judicial
Conference's Budget Committee or the Defender Services Committee. 

Among the initiatives are (1) the creation of a nine-person program
analysis office within the Defender Services Division of AOUSC; (2)
efforts to develop Defender Services case weights and FDO work
measurement formulas and improve available analytical data by
requiring additional financial and statistical data, including FDO
reporting of out-of-court time; (3) implementation of new &quot;death
penalty&quot; panel attorney vouchers to aid improved cost analysis; (4)
continuation of a study to assess the impact of the federal
sentencing guidelines on program costs; and (5) improved audits of
FPDs, CDOs, and DPRCs.  The Judiciary also announced steps to control
FDO costs, such as limitations on space alterations, salary
increases, and travel. 

The Judicial Conference's Committee on Defender Services has
established a Death Penalty Representation subcommittee (generally
known as the Cox Committee, after its Chair, Judge Emmett R.  Cox) to
reevaluate the DPRC concept and report on proposals for containing
death penalty litigation costs.  The subcommittee is reviewing
available data, soliciting the views of various sources, and planning
to complete its work during the summer of 1995. 

AOUSC's Office of Audit continues to play a role in evaluating
various aspects of the program.  The Office, either directly or
through its contractor accounting firm, conducts periodic financial
audits of court operations, which include reviews of FPD activities
and panel attorney payments.  The Office's audit staff has identified
some FPD office deficiencies regarding payroll, time and attendance,
and disbursements, as well as problems in some DPRCs' reporting on
time spent on federal representations.  At its January 1995 meeting,
the Judicial Conference's Committee on Defender Services directed
AOUSC to contract centrally for audits of CDOs and DPRCs. 

AOUSC's comments on a draft of this report mentioned some additional
initiatives (see app.  III). 


   AGENCY COMMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :11

AOUSC's written comments incorporated the views of the Chair of the
Judicial Conference's Committee on Defender Services.  AOUSC said
that the findings and issues identified in our report would assist
the Judiciary in its ongoing efforts to increase the type, quality,
and consistency of data being collected on the activities of FDOs,
DPRCs, and panel attorneys.  AOUSC identified a number of specific
efforts, planned and underway, to improve data collection and
analysis and contain Defender Services costs.  A number of these
efforts were initiated in response to our work.  On the basis of our
review of the information provided by AOUSC, we agree that successful
completion of AOUSC's efforts--both those mentioned in its letter and
those discussed in our report-- would help to rectify the issues
identified in our report.  The full text of AOUSC's comments are in
appendix III.

OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY
=========================================================== Appendix I

The former Chairman, and now Ranking Minority Member, of the
Subcommittee on the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the
Judiciary, and Related Agencies, Senate Committee on Appropriations,
requested that we examine a number of issues regarding the Federal
Defender Services program and the causes of the rapid growth in both
program workload and costs.  Specifically, we were asked to assess,
for fiscal years 1990 to 1993 and the first half of 1994: 

  the causes of the growth in overall Defender Services workload and
     costs, including the reasons that Defender Services workload has
     grown faster than district court criminal cases;

  the comparative costs of representations closed provided by FDOs
     and panel attorneys and, if the FDO costs were lower, what
     actions the federal judiciary was taking to increase the use of
     FDOs;

  the additional costs of paying standard higher hourly rates to
     panel attorneys in all or parts of 16 districts; and

  the causes of the increased workload and costs of the DPRCs,
     including whether the DPRCs had helped to reduce or contain the
     costs of panel attorney death penalty representations. 

However, because of the data limitations described below, and as
agreed with the requestor, we changed our objectives to provide
information on (1) reasons that Defender Services workload has grown
faster than district court criminal cases; (2) data available to
assess the causes of increased Defender Services workload and costs;
(3) comparative costs of representations closed by federal defender
organizations and by private attorneys directly assigned by federal
judges; (4) additional costs of paying higher standard hourly rates
to private, court-appointed attorneys in all or parts of 16
districts; (5) the comparative costs of panel attorney and DPRC death
penalty representations; and (6) the potential causes of increased
DPRC workload and costs. 

To meet these objectives, we reviewed prior studies of the Federal
Defender Services program, including those of the Committee to Review
the Criminal Justice Act (commonly referred to as the Prado
Committee), the Judicial Conference of the United States, the
Defender Services Division, and the Financial Analysis Office of the
Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts (AOUSC).  We also reviewed
a number of private studies of death penalty litigation, including
studies of DPRCs by the Spangenberg Group, a consulting firm. 

We met with federal court officials, including the Chairman of the
Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States,
the Chair of the Judicial Conference Committee on Defender Services,
the Defender Services Advisory Committee, and the Chief Judge of the
Second Circuit court of appeals.  We also met with judges, federal
and community defenders, and other officials in the Eastern and
Southern Districts of New York, Eastern District of Michigan,
District of New Jersey, District of Delaware, and Southern District
of California.  These districts were judgmentally selected.  Delaware
was chosen because it was served by the FPD for New Jersey.  The
districts of Southern and Eastern New York, Eastern Michigan, and New
Jersey had large criminal caseloads and were near our regional office
staff.  We chose the Southern District of California because Defender
Services officials told us this district had developed a method of
tracking attorney hours that captured many of the elements, such as
representations for defendants charged with offenses carrying a
mandatory minimum sentence, not captured by the national data systems
used in our analysis.  We also met with AOUSC officials in the Office
of Audit, Defender Services Division, Office of Finance and Budget,
and Statistics Division to discuss a number of issues, including
studies they had or were conducting on Defender Services workload and
costs. 

DATA AVAILABLE ON DEFENDER
SERVICES WORKLOAD AND COSTS

We identified the workload and cost data available from AOUSC.  FPD
and CDO workload data are reported semiannually by each office on
form JS-50.  We obtained these semiannual workload reports for fiscal
years 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, and the first half of fiscal year 1994
and produced a dataset to analyze FPD and CDO workload by case type,
disposition (where available), and type of representation--criminal,
appeals, and all other representations (such as bail and
probation/parole revocation hearings and habeas corpus proceedings). 

We obtained a copy of the automated database created from the
vouchers submitted by panel attorneys for fiscal years 1990 through
1993, plus the first 6 months of fiscal year 1994.  This database
contained data on the amount of in-court and out-of- court
compensation requested by panel attorneys and approved by the court,
the approval date, the payment date, and the attorney's authorized
hourly in-court and out-of-court billing rates.  We did not verify
the accuracy of the data entered on the forms or the database AOUSC
provided.  However, edit checks on the internal reliability of data
in selected data fields in the database, such as attorney hourly
rates, revealed some questions about the accuracy of the data in
these fields.  These problems are discussed in later sections of this
appendix. 

AOUSC's master criminal file provided a wide variety of data on
overall criminal workload in the federal district courts.  We used
this database, the annual statistical reports of the courts, and a
Statistics Division analysis to identify trends in total district
court criminal workload, such as the number of multiple defendant
criminal cases filed in district courts, the number of trials with
four or more defendants, and trial lengths in days. 

However, the master criminal file did not reliably differentiate
between Defender Services cases and other cases, precluding a
comparison of overall workload trends and Defender Services workload
trends.  In addition, data on some of the workload and cost variables
we were asked to examine were unavailable or too incomplete to be
analyzed.  These included data on: 

  the number of defendants who required court-appointed counsel
     because their assets had been seized or frozen (not available);

  the total number of cases in which defendants were charged with
     offenses carrying mandatory minimum sentences (not available
     nationally, although we found that the CDO for the Southern
     District of California maintained such data, beginning in fiscal
     year 1993);

  the number of panel attorney appointments resulting from multiple
     defendant cases in which more than one defendant required a
     court-appointed attorney (not available nationally);\1

  the additional hours Defender Services attorneys expend on
     representations because of the implementation of the federal
     sentencing guidelines (not available);

  federal prosecutions of cases developed by state investigative
     agencies, such as weapons or drug cases prosecuted in federal
     courts to take advantage of higher mandatory minimum sentences
     imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines (not available
     from AOUSC).\2

  the link between the increased number of assistant U.S.  Attorneys
     and the number of criminal cases filed in U.S.  district courts
     (only basic trends can be described from available data, such as
     the percent increase in resources for criminal prosecutions and
     criminal cases initiated in federal courts). 

Defender Services officials said that each of these factors had
contributed to increased attorney hours and costs per representation
closed.  Early in our work we informed Subcommittee staff that these
data limitations precluded an assessment of the direct impact of
individual factors on Defender Services workload and costs. 
Therefore, as agreed with the requestor, we changed our objectives.

workload and cost data for criminal representations closed.

\a Criminal cases in district courts were recorded in the master
criminal file; the appeals database contained data on criminal
appeals; the trial database included data on the number and length of
criminal trials. 

\b Data for these offices are reported semiannually on the JS-50
form. 

\c Panel attorney workload data were derived from the CJA-20 database
which includes data from the forms (called CJA-20s) on which panel
attorneys requested payment and on which approved payments were
recorded.  Attorney requests for payment for other expenses, such as
expert witnesses and investigators, were reported on the CJA-21 form,
which we did not review. 

\d The CDO for the Southern District of California in San Diego has
developed its own automated system for tracking attorney hours and
assignments that includes many data elements not recorded on the
forms we reviewed.  The San Diego system was not designed to track
costs per representation. 

\e The master criminal file included a field for type of legal
counsel, including whether the defendant had a court-appointed
attorney.  However, according to AOUSC, the data in this field were
not reliable.  Our own validity test confirmed this assessment.  The
data in this field could be entered twice--when the case was filed
and when the case was closed. 

\f A representation appeared in the database only when an attorney
submitted a request for partial or complete payment.  This request
may not have appeared in the file for the fiscal year in which the
attorney was appointed.  If the attorney submitted two vouchers for
the same representation in two different fiscal years, the second
voucher was counted as a separate representation.  Thus, it was
possible to double-count representations and defendants in such
cases.  For example, in fiscal years 1991 and 1992 we found that
1,591 (about 2 percent) of the panel attorney representations were
double-counted. 

\g For panel attorneys, determining the number of unique defendants
disposed requires matching individual vouchers with a number of data
elements as discussed later in this appendix.  The number of
defendants disposed by each type of counsel cannot necessarily be
added together to obtain the total number of separate defendants whom
FDOs and panel attorneys have represented.  It is possible for a
single defendant to be represented by more than one type of attorney. 
For example, the defendant could be represented by a FPD or CDO
attorney at the bail hearing, but by a panel attorney for the
remainder of the case.  In such instances, Defender Services data
would report two representations--one for FDOs in the JS-50 reports
(under &quot;other&quot; representations for the bail hearing), and one in the
CJA-20 database (under criminal representations) for the panel
attorney representation. 

\h Not available.  The master criminal file and appeals databases
were designed to track overall workload, not cost per case or
attorney or judge hours per case. 

\i Out-of-court hours were to be reported beginning in fiscal year
1995. 

\j Types of dispositions included guilty pleas, dismissals,
acquittals, and trials, including both nonjury and jury trials.  The
master criminal file defines nonjury trials as any contested
proceeding before a judge at which evidence is introduced. 

\k The master criminal file contained data on the type of disposition
by case and defendant, but not on the length of the trial, if there
was a trial.  The trial database contained data on the length of
criminal trials but not by type of offense, such as drugs or weapons. 

\l The master criminal file included the most serious charge at
indictment and the most serious charge of conviction as determined by
the maximum penalty that could be imposed.  If the mandatory minimum
offense were not the most serious charge in either case, it would not
be shown in the database. 

\m In its December 1992 study of Defender Services costs, AOUSC
calculated the cost per representation closed for FPDs and CDOs by
dividing their total obligations by the total number of
representations closed.  In the fiscal year 1995 budget submission,
cost per representation closed was calculated as total obligations
divided by total new appointments.  The cost data for panel attorneys
in both the December 1992 study and the fiscal year 1995 budget
submission reflected representations for which at least partial
payment had been made.  Our analysis used representations closed for
both types of counsel.  For panel attorneys, we used the same
definition of case closed as AOUSC. 

\n Some FDOs serve more than one district.  There is a place on the
form to identify the district of jurisdiction.  We did not use these
data or check their reliability. 

\o In the database the district of origin was not available for about
98 percent of appeals representations closed for fiscal years 1990
through 1993 and for about 85 percent of representations closed in
the first 6 months of fiscal year 1994.  The district of origin was
missing for about 10 percent or less for all other types of
representations. 

\p Types of representations included criminal, appeals, and other
(which includes bail hearings, probation and parole revocations, and
civil actions, such as habeas corpus proceedings and prisoner
petitions). 

\q Data included total number of appeals, but not whether the appeal
was an appeal of conviction, sentence, or both.  Under the federal
sentencing guidelines, a defendant may appeal the sentence without
appealing the conviction.  The government may also appeal the
sentence. 

The types of data reported for panel attorneys and for FDOs differed
in many respects, significantly limiting the comparisons that could
be made between the work of panel attorneys and defender
organizations.  As shown in table I.1, the criminal caseload data
available from the principal judiciary databases were varied and not
always comparable.  While the number of multiple defendant cases
could be obtained from the master criminal file, for example, we
could not determine how many defendants in these cases required
court-appointed counsel.  The national workload data available for
FDOs and CDOs included the number of new representations, number of
representations closed, and number of representations pending at the
end of the fiscal year.  However, the data available on panel
attorneys included only the number of representations
closed--representations for which panel attorneys had requested
payment.  If the representation were closed, but the panel attorney
did not request payment during the same fiscal year, the
representation would not appear in the database until the attorney
had submitted a voucher for payment. 

COMPARISON OF DEFENDER SERVICES
REPRESENTATIONS WITH DISTRICT
COURT CRIMINAL WORKLOAD

To determine why the rate of Defender Services representations closed
has exceeded the increase in criminal filings in recent years, we
tried to identify those Defender Services representations that were
most analogous to criminal filings in district courts.  Defender
Services representations were reported in three broad
categories--criminal, appeals, and other.  After consulting with
Defender Services and AOUSC's Statistics Division, we determined that
the category &quot;criminal representations&quot; was most analogous to
criminal filings as reported by the district courts and recorded in
the master criminal file. 

Appeals are reported in AOUSC statistical reports as workload of the
courts of appeals.  Thus, such representations would not be reported
in district court workload statistics.  The category &quot;other
representations&quot; included proceedings, such as prisoner petitions and
habeas corpus petitions, that are civil actions and reported in
district court civil workload statistics. 

Defendants disposed rather than commenced in district courts was the
most appropriate comparison between Defender Services criminal
representations and district court criminal workload statistics. 
This was because panel attorney data were not available on new
appointments but were available only for representations closed
(those for which payment had been requested).  When this comparison
was made, we found that Defender Services criminal representations
did not exceed the number of criminal defendants disposed in district
courts. 

COMPARING FDO AND PANEL ATTORNEY
WORKLOAD AND COSTS

As summarized in table I.1, comparable workload and cost data for
FDOs and panel attorneys were limited.  FPDs and CDOs reported
aggregate data on case disposition (such as trial or guilty plea);
panel attorneys did not.  Panel attorneys reported both in-court and
out-of-court hours; FPDs and CDOs reported only in- court hours. 
Because panel attorneys submitted vouchers for each type of
representation they were assigned--criminal representations, appeals,
other--it was possible to calculate the average cost per
representation for different types of panel attorney representations. 
However, FPD and CDO cost data were not available by type of
representation.  Consequently, we could not determine FPD and CDO
costs by type of representation using existing data.  Therefore, we
used aggregate FPD and CDO costs per representation when comparing
panel attorney and FDO costs per representation. 

An AOUSC study found that CDOs had a lower average cost per
representation closed than FPDs or panel attorneys.  Defender
Services officials suggested that a large number of relatively
inexpensive immigration representations, particularly in the CDO for
the Southern District of California in San Diego, may have largely
accounted for the lower average CDO costs.  The CDO for the Southern
District of California accounted for more than half of all Defender
Services immigration representations.  Because of its impact on total
CDO workload and costs, we examined CDO workload and costs with and
without San Diego included in the analyses. 

The San Diego CDO has developed its own system for tracking attorney
assignments and hours that captured a variety of data not available
from the AOUSC forms, such as representations involving offenses
carrying a mandatory minimum prison term, dispositions by type of
offense, in-court and out-of-court hours by type of offense, and
multiple defendant cases.  The San Diego system was not designed to
capture costs per representation closed but was principally designed
to track attorney hours and aid in attorney assignments.  The fiscal
year 1993 San Diego data on attorney hours provided a case study of
the impact of multiple defendant cases and representations involving
mandatory minimum offenses on attorney hours.  The San Diego data
also illustrated how such attorney hour data could aid the Defender
Services Division in analyzing its workload. 


--------------------
\1 In such cases, only one defendant was generally to be assigned to
the local FPD or CDO; all remaining defendants requiring
court-appointed counsel were to be assigned to panel attorneys.  The
rationale for limiting FPD and CDO appointments to a single defendant
in multiple defendant cases is to avoid conflicts of interest that
may arise from representing more than one defendant in the same case. 

\2 The U.S.  Attorney database indicated that the U.S.  Attorneys
initiated a total of 35,000 criminal cases in federal district courts
in fiscal year 1992, including 1,158 cases referred by state
investigative agencies and 344 cases referred by District of Columbia
authorities.  About two-thirds of the cases referred by state or D.C. 
authorities were narcotics cases. 


      HOW WE COUNTED FPD, CDO, AND
      PANEL ATTORNEY
      REPRESENTATIONS
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:0.1

To compare the workload and per representation costs for FPDs, CDOs,
and panel attorneys, we developed a working definition of
representation, and calculated costs and in-court hours per
representation.  As explained below, we used representations closed
as our basic measure of Defender Services workload.  Because FPDs and
CDOs did not report out-of-court hours per representation closed for
the years we reviewed, we could only compare in-court hours per
representation closed for FPDs, CDOs, and panel attorneys. 

Prior to its fiscal year 1996 submission, the Judiciary's
congressional budget submissions counted workload differently for
FDOs and panel attorneys.  FPDs and CDOs have been reported as cases
opened, the basic equivalent of new court appointments.  For panel
attorneys, the submissions have used &quot;cases against which payment is
made in a given fiscal year.&quot; In its fiscal year 1996 submission, the
Judiciary used &quot;representations closed&quot; for reporting FPD and CDO
workload, adopting the method we used to count workload. 

Our analysis used FPD and CDO representations closed as reported on
the AOUSC forms, because data for panel attorneys were available only
for (1) closed representations; or (2) representations for which
panel attorneys had requested partial payment, though the case may
not yet have been completed.\3 We defined a panel attorney
representation as the representation of a defendant charged with or
convicted of a specific offense by a private, court-appointed
attorney.  Representations for convicted defendants included appeals
of conviction and/or sentence or habeas corpus proceedings in which
the defendant may be challenging a state conviction in federal
court.\4

We took several steps to avoid double-counting panel attorney
representations closed.  When a panel attorney was appointed, the
court assigned a unique voucher number that the panel attorney was to
use when submitting request(s) for payment.  Panel attorneys may
submit more than one voucher for each representation using the
voucher number they were assigned upon appointment.  We considered
all claims for payment under a single voucher number to be part of a
single representation.  If payments under the same voucher number
were approved and paid in two successive fiscal years, AOUSC counted
the request for payment in the new fiscal year as a separate
representation.  We found 691 voucher numbers that appeared in fiscal
years 1990 and 1991, 900 numbers that appeared in fiscal years 1991
and 1992, and 1,202 numbers that appeared in fiscal years 1992 and
1993.\5 Thus, AOUSC would have counted as separate representations
691 voucher numbers in 1991, 900 in 1992, and 1,202 in 1993. 

We followed the AOUSC convention because we were tracking payments
per representation closed in each fiscal year.  Thus, like AOUSC, our
counts of representations closed in each fiscal year were not
precisely accurate.  First, we overestimated representations actually
closed in fiscal year 1990 by as much as 691 (2.4 percent of the
28,575 representations we attributed to 1990); in fiscal 1991 by as
many as 900 (2.5 percent of 36,027 representations); and in fiscal
year 1992 by as many as 1,202 representations (3.3 percent of 36,479
representations). 

Second, this method of counting did not accurately reflect panel
attorney costs per representation closed.  If each voucher number
appearing in two fiscal years represented a single representation,
then the true cost for each representation closed would be the total
of all the payments made under each voucher number for both fiscal
years.  This approach affected hours per representation closed for
the same reason.  The total attorney hours appearing in both fiscal
years would be the true hours per representation closed. 

Some defendants were represented by more than one panel attorney in
the same case, but we counted such situations as a single
representation.  To determine a single panel attorney representation,
we matched offense, court district, docket number, and defendant
name.  Multiple records and multiple voucher numbers that matched
exactly on these data elements were considered part of a single
representation.  If they did not match on all data elements, we
counted them as separate representations. 


--------------------
\3 While panel attorneys are generally expected to submit a single
voucher after the representation is closed, they may and do submit
interim vouchers for payment. 

\4 Habeas corpus proceedings are civil, not criminal, proceedings. 

\5 We did not determine how many numbers, if any, appeared in more
than two successive fiscal years. 


      HOW WE CALCULATED COSTS PER
      REPRESENTATION CLOSED
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:0.2

We calculated FPD and CDO costs per representation closed by dividing
the total budget obligations for all FPDs or CDOs by the total number
of FPD (or CDO) representations closed in that fiscal year, as
reported on the AOUSC forms.  Thus, if total FPD obligations were
$100,000 and total representations closed were 1,000, the cost per
FPD representation closed would be $100 ($100,000/1,000).  This
calculation was not very precise, but available data did not permit a
more detailed estimate of costs per representation closed.  This
methodology may have overstated the FPD and CDO costs per
representation closed because an undeterminable portion of their
budgets was used for representations opened, but not closed, during
the fiscal year.  In addition, FDO attorneys provide training for
panel attorneys, the costs of which are included in FDO budgets. 

The calculation of panel attorney costs per representation closed was
somewhat more complicated.  The AOUSC used &quot;payment date&quot;--the date
on which the check was written--to calculate per representation
costs.  In fiscal years 1991 and 1992, payments to panel attorneys
were deferred due to shortage of funds, with large numbers of
payments made in the first month of the new fiscal year.  Thus,
payment date was not necessarily the best measure of when the
representation was closed.  Therefore, we used &quot;certification date,&quot;
the date on which the court approved payment, because this date was
likely to be closer to the date on which the work was completed and
payment requested than the payment date. 

We calculated costs per representation closed using a two-step
process.  First, to determine costs for closed representations having
a single panel attorney, we aggregated all payments for each voucher
number.  That is, if there were five payments approved for voucher
number 12345, we combined all five payments to obtain a single cost
for that voucher number.  Second, we aggregated all payments for each
voucher number associated with the same representation.  For example,
if voucher numbers 54321 and 67890 were associated with the same
representation, we combined them into a single total for that
representation. 

As noted, our panel attorney costs per representation closed may be
somewhat understated since in the database we used the costs for as
many as 691 representations that were split between fiscal years 1990
and 1991, 900 between 1991 and 1992, and 1,202 between 1992 and 1993. 
Moreover, our costs per representation closed included attorney time
only.  The costs of experts, investigators, and other services,
reported on another form, were not included in our costs because of
the difficulty of matching these payments, recorded in a separate
database, with the representations recorded in the AOUSC database for
attorney hours.  However, such costs were included in the costs for
FPDs and CDOs, since these costs were included in the total budget
obligations we used to calculate FPD and CDO costs.  Thus, the FPD
and CDO cost per representation closed used in our analysis included
all costs incurred by these organizations, while our panel attorney
cost per representation closed included only attorney time. 
Consequently, any FPD or CDO cost advantage we found in our analysis
was probably somewhat understated. 


      HOW WE CALCULATED HOURS PER
      REPRESENTATION CLOSED
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:0.3

We used the in-court hours reported on the JS-50 forms for
representations closed to calculate FPD and CDO in-court hours per
representation closed.  FPDs and CDOs did not report out-of- court
hours.  Panel attorney vouchers included separate sections for
in-court and out-of-court compensation requested and approved.  In
all but 16 districts panel attorneys were reimbursed at the standard
rate of $60 per hour for in-court time and $40 per hour for
out-of-court time.  Thus, in these districts in-court hours are
reimbursed at a rate 50 percent higher than out-of-court hours.  The
court may reduce the amount requested for either in-court
compensation, out-of-court compensation, or both.  However, where the
court made a reduction in the amount approved for payment, the
database did not usually indicate the number of attorney hours by
which the request had been reduced.  Rather, the database showed
separately the amount requested and the amount approved for payment. 

Because attorney hours were not entered into the automated database,
AOUSC calculated the actual number of in-court hours expended per
panel attorney representations by dividing the total amount of
compensation requested (for example, $2,400) for in-court time by the
authorized hourly rate ($60 in most districts).  The same calculation
was made for out-of-court hours.  The database supports no other
reasonable method of calculation.  Consequently, we used the same
method to calculate attorney hours per representation closed. 

If the the authorized hourly rate is recorded erroneously on the
CJA-20, this would affect the calculation of attorney hours.  We
found a wide variety of hourly rates reported in the database for
both death penalty and nondeath penalty representations.  Some
appeared to be keying errors.  For example, in more than 1,300
nondeath penalty panel attorney representations in fiscal year 1993
the out-of-court hourly rate was recorded as $752, perhaps reflecting
a data entry error.  The correct rate was probably $75--the higher
standard hourly rate in those districts authorized to pay the higher
rates.  However, because of the method used to calculate panel
attorney hours, this error would reduce by a factor of 10 the actual
out-of-court hours reported as expended in such cases.  Due to
resource limitations, we did not validate the hourly rates entered in
the database.  Consequently, we could not determine the magnitude of
the error that may be attributable to such erroneous hourly rates,
and the data used in our analyses were based on the rates as reported
in the database. 

FPDs and CDOs were not assigned death penalty cases during the period
of our review.  Therefore, when comparing FPD, CDO, and panel
attorney average costs per representation closed, we used the average
panel attorney cost per representation closed, excluding death
penalty representations.  We separately calculated the costs for
panel attorney death penalty representations closed for the analysis
on death penalty representations. 


      HOW WE ESTIMATED THE IMPACT
      OF INCREASED REPRESENTATIONS
      CLOSED ON PROGRAM COSTS
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:0.4

To estimate the impact of increased workload (as measured by
representations closed) on program costs, we estimated what fiscal
year 1993 costs would have been if the average cost per
representation closed had remained unchanged throughout the period at
the fiscal year 1990 average cost per representation closed
(unadjusted for inflation).  For example, in fiscal year 1990, total
panel attorney criminal representation costs were $47,212,797, with
an average cost of $1,985 each.  At $1,985 each, the 29,237 panel
attorney criminal representations closed in fiscal year 1993 would
have cost $58,035,445, or $10,822,648 more than the total 1990 costs. 
However, total 1993 panel attorney costs for criminal representations
were actually $30,009,222 more than the 1990 total.  Thus, we
estimated that the increased workload accounted for about 36 percent
of increased panel attorney costs for criminal representations
between fiscal years 1990 and 1993.\6

We did not adjust the 1990 cost per representation closed for
inflation because we wanted a comparable estimate for panel attorneys
and FDOs.  While FDO attorneys received cost-of-living adjustments
during the period (though not always at the same time in the fiscal
year), the basic panel attorney hourly rates in 78 of 94 districts
remained unchanged at $40 (out-of-court) and $60 (in-court).  We had
already separately estimated the impact of paying higher standard
hourly rates to panel attorneys in the 16 districts in which higher
rates were paid in fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993.  Although our
use of 1990 average costs unadjusted for inflation may have
underestimated the impact of increased workload on program costs,
particularly for FDOs, it was the most straightforward method of
developing reasonable, comparable estimates for panel attorneys and
FDOs. 

HOW WE CALCULATED THE ADDITIONAL
COST OF PAYING HIGHER HOURLY RATES
IN 16 DISTRICTS

In 78 districts, panel attorneys are paid a standard hourly rate of
$40 for each out-of-court hour and $60 for each in-court hour.  In
all or parts of 16 districts, panel attorneys are paid a single,
standard higher hourly rate of $60, $70, or $75 for both in-court and
out-of-court hours.  The applicable rate varies by district.  The
AOUSC database included the hourly rate and the separate amounts of
compensation requested for in-court and out-of-court hours, but the
database did not include the number of in-court or out-of-court hours
on which the request was based.  We excluded from our analysis
representations compensated at rates other than the standard higher
rates, as applicable, of $60, $70, or $75 per hour in these 16
districts.  Representations compensated at other hourly rates would,
by definition, have been exceptions to the standard higher hourly
rates prevailing in these districts.  In some of these districts, the
higher rate applies only to specific location(s) within the district. 
To the extent that the higher standard rates were approved in
specific cases outside these locations, they would be included in our
analysis because we could identify representations only by district,
not by specific locations within a district. 

We calculated the number of in-court hours and out-of-court hours by
dividing the total requested amount by the approved hourly rate.  We
used these hours to recalculate the requested compensation at the
rate of $40 for each out-of-court hour and $60 for each in-court
hour.  This provided a comparison between requested compensation at
the higher standard rate in these districts and the amount that would
have been requested using the lower standard hourly rates of $40
out-of-court and $60 in-court. 

However, the courts reduced some requests for compensation at the
higher rates.  Consequently, a comparison based solely on requested
compensation would overstate the amount actually paid in the
higher-rate districts.  To determine how much had actually been
approved and paid in each of the 16 higher-rate districts, we used
the AOUSC database to identify the amount by which the requests for
compensation had been reduced in each district. 

We then compared the amounts actually approved and paid at the higher
rates with the amounts that would have been requested at the lower
rates.  We did not also reduce the calculation using the lower rates
because the database provided no basis on which to make such an
adjustment.  The database did not explain the basis for the
reductions in requested compensation, nor were there any data on the
number of hours disallowed--only final dollar amounts approved and
paid.  Our method of calculation produced a conservative estimate of
the additional costs of paying the higher rates in the 16 districts. 

Our estimates and cost comparisons were also conservative because we
excluded from the analysis any voucher without a district identifier. 
For every type of representation--criminal, appeals, other--some
representations did not include district identifiers, but only the
appeals circuit in which the district was located.  Each circuit,
except the District of Columbia circuit, covers a number of states
and districts.  The higher-cost districts are in the second, third,
seventh, ninth, and tenth circuits, but not all districts in each of
these circuits were authorized to pay the higher panel attorney
hourly rates. 

At least 98 percent of all appeals in the database for fiscal years
1990 through 1993, and 85 percent in the first half of 1994, were
identified only by the circuit in which the appeal was filed. 
Consequently, our estimate of paying the higher rates excluded the
costs of most appeals originating in the districts authorized to pay
the higher rates. 

DEATH PENALTY RESOURCE CENTERS

To assess the costs of representations by DPRCs we relied primarily
on DPRC budget and workload data included in the DPRCs' quarterly
reports and data on panel attorney costs per death penalty
representation closed from the AOUSC database.  Because there were no
baseline cost data prior to the DPRCs' creation, we could not
determine whether the services the DPRCs provided had helped to
reduce the costs of death penalty litigation.  Because of
considerable variations in the type of work each DPRC does, including
the mix of direct representations and assistance provided to private
counsel, we could not determine whether the increased costs of the
DPRCs were justified by the workload. 

About 37 percent of panel attorney death penalty representations
closed in fiscal year 1991, 23 percent in fiscal year 1992, and 17
percent in fiscal year 1993 were not identified by district.  This
precluded a comparison of the costs of panel attorney death penalty
representations closed in districts with and without DPRCs. 

To develop descriptive information on DPRCs, we reviewed the fiscal
year 1991, 1992, and 1993 quarterly reports submitted by the DPRCs on
their workload.  California did not submit quarterly reports until
fiscal year 1994 because it submitted monthly vouchers instead;
fiscal year 1991 quarterly reports for the Georgia DPRC were also
unavailable. 

We also reviewed studies by the Spangenberg Group, a consulting firm,
on death penalty litigation and costs, and incorporated some of their
data in our analysis, as appropriate. 



--------------------
\6 This is derived by dividing $10,822,648 (the cost of the increased
workload at the 1990 average cost per representation closed) by
$30,009,222 (the actual increased costs). 


SELECTED DATA ON DEFENDER SERVICES
WORKLOAD AND COSTS
========================================================== Appendix II

This appendix provides selected tables on Defender Services workload
and costs for fiscal years 1990 through 1993.  Where available, data
for the first 6 months of fiscal year 1994 are included.  The tables
in this appendix supplement the tables and figures in the letter. 

Only overall costs per representation closed were available for FPDs
and CDOs.  However, per representation costs by type of
representation and major offense category (within criminal
representations) were available for panel attorneys and are shown in
tables II.7 and II.8.

\a Amounts in this table exclude most appeals representations.  For
about 98 percent of all appeals representations in fiscal years 1990
through 1993 and 85 percent in the first half of fiscal year 1994,
the database does not contain an identifier for the district from
which the case was appealed. 

\b Totals reflect any court reductions in the amount of compensation
requested. 

\c Totals at lower rate assume compensation for total number of hours
requested.  Because the database did not reflect the number of hours
by which requests were reduced, only dollar amounts of the
reductions, we could not correspondingly reduce the amount that would
have been approved at the lower rates.

Since 1983, the United States has maintained a semipermanent military
presence at Honduras' Soto Cano Air Force Base.\1 The U.S.  presence
was established there to support U.S.  military and political
interests in Central America, which were threatened by communist
expansion in the region.  With the end of the Cold War and political
changes that have occurred in the region, we examined the continuing
need for a semipermanent U.S.  military presence in Honduras. 
Specifically, we assessed whether this U.S.  military presence is
critical to current U.S.  activities and objectives in the region. 
The cost to maintain the U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano is
projected to be about $38 million in fiscal year 1994.  In light of
budget constraints and current efforts to increase the
cost-effectiveness of the Department of Defense's (DOD) worldwide
operations, we believe this report will be of interest to the
Subcommittee. 


--------------------
\1 A combination of conditions have contributed to describing the
U.S.  military presence in Honduras as semipermanent.  These include
the early congressional concerns that facilities not be
permanent-type construction, the short-term assignments at Soto Cano,
and the use of semipermanent facilities for more than 10 years. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

The U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano provides useful and
convenient support to some U.S.  government activities but is not
critical to these activities or current U.S.  policy objectives in
the region--which are now oriented toward economic growth and
democratic reform.  U.S.  military and embassy officials in the
region agree that the military's contribution to the new objectives
is incidental and not reason enough to maintain the presence. 
Moreover, the United States has underway a range of official programs
to achieve economic and democracy objectives in Latin America, which
are being carried out by several civilian agencies. 

With the end of the Cold War and political changes that have occurred
in the region, the major missions of U.S.  personnel at Soto Cano are
to support military training exercises, humanitarian and civic
assistance exercises, and U.S.  counterdrug activities.  However, the
U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano is not essential to training
exercises.  Similar training is routinely conducted in other Central
American countries without this type of semipermanent arrangement. 
The U.S.  Army has recently acknowledged that training can be
conducted in the region without a semipermanent logistics support
base. 

Soto Cano is located in the center of the drug transit area, and U.S. 
military personnel there assist the U.S.  Customs Service, the U.S. 
Navy, and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in counterdrug
operations.  However, this support is minimal.  Officials from the
three agencies characterized the support they received as convenient,
but not critical, and said they could continue their operations in
the region without support from the U.S.  military at Soto Cano. 

The pending withdrawal of U.  S.  forces from Howard Air Force Base
in Panama was also ascribed as a reason for the continuing U.S. 
presence at Soto Cano.  Some U.S.  government officials believe that
the U.S.  presence at Soto Cano provides the U.S.  military with
needed flexibility as it draws down assets in Panama and in the event
of a future crisis in the region.  However, the current arrangement
with the Honduran government does not guarantee that the United
States could have full access for future U.S.  missions.  A
significant expansion of U.S.  assets at Soto Cano and access for
future military missions would likely be encumbered by a number of
factors, including the absence of a base rights agreement, limited
capacity, and political issues.  DOD and State Department officials
acknowledged it was unlikely the United States would become involved
in a major military conflict in Latin America. 

The original reasons for the establishment of U.S.  presence at Soto
Cano no longer exist.  The elimination of this arrangement would have
minimal impact on current U.S.  missions and objectives in the region
and would potentially result in budgetary savings.  However, we did
not attempt to establish firm estimates of cost savings that would
result from discontinuing the U.S.  presence because there were too
many unknowns, including how current activities at Soto Cano would be
dispersed to other DOD installations or whether they would be
eliminated. 


   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

In August 1983, DOD established a joint task force called Joint Task
Force-Bravo (JTF-B) of about 1,100 Army and Air Force personnel at
Soto Cano (formerly, Palmerola Air Base), the Honduran military
installation that houses the Honduran Air Force Academy.  The
presence was established to support various U.S.  political and
military objectives that demonstrated U.S.  commitment to its allies
against the increasing communist threat in the region.  JTF-B and the
other U.S.  military units at Soto Cano were assigned missions to
coordinate and support U.S.  counterinsurgency and intelligence
operations, and military training exercises in the region.  When
directed, JTF-B provides support for disaster relief, search and
rescue, and contingency-type missions in Central America.  JTF-B was
established as a subordinate unit of the U.S.  Southern Command
(USSOUTHCOM), headquartered in Panama. 

The United States funded construction projects and infrastructure
upgrades at Soto Cano, such as a F-16 capable runway, semipermanent
barracks, offices and recreational facilities, 22 miles of roads, and
upgrades of the water, sewer, and electrical systems.  The annual
cost for the United States to maintain the U.S.  military presence at
Soto Cano has grown steadily from about $24 million annually in the
mid-1980s to a projected $38 million for 1994.  (See table 1 for a
breakdown of the costs.) Since 1991, the average annual cost of new
construction and upgrades has been about $2.5 million.  U.S. 
operations at Soto Cano are funded from the Army's and the Air
Force's Operations and Maintenance accounts. 

In addition to JTF-B, other U.S.  military units are stationed at
Soto Cano to support JTF-B's missions, such as an aviation battalion
and a military police platoon.  About two-thirds of the U.S. 
military personnel assigned to Soto Cano are on temporary duty,
usually from 4 to 6 months.  The remainder serve a 1-year tour. 

In April 1994, authorized U.S.  military personnel at Soto Cano was
reduced to 780 (see app.  I).  At the time of our fieldwork, DOD
officials told us that the level of personnel was scheduled to
increase to about 900 in October 1994 due to the relocation of
helicopter personnel and three helicopters stationed in Panama.  DOD
officials informed us that this move was being made to keep aircraft
assets in the theater due to the drawdown of U.S.  forces in Panama. 
However, during discussions on a draft of this report, DOD officials
told us that the level is now scheduled to decrease to about 500
personnel in October 1995 due to the deactivation of a helicopter
battalion, which will reduce the number of helicopters from 31 to 11. 
In addition, all U.S.  aviation operations and support at Soto Cano
will be consolidated with JTF-B facilities, and the current main air
facility, Camp Pickett, will be closed. 

According to DOD documents, the U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano
contributes about $14 million annually to the Honduran economy in the
form of contracts and services to support the U.S.  military
presence.  This includes the U.S.  military personnel estimated
spending on the Honduran local economy. 


   MILITARY PRESENCE AT SOTO CANO
   NOT ESSENTIAL TO NEW STRATEGIC
   INTERESTS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

With the resolution of military conflicts and greater political
stability in Central America, the focus of U.S.  interest in the
region has shifted from political/military objectives to economic
growth and democracy building.  The U.S.  government officials we met
with said that the continuing U.S.  military presence contributed to
U.S.  democracy objectives, but that the contribution was incidental
to their presence to perform other missions. 

Since 1990, Central America has experienced new political stability
as the conflicts in El Salvador and Nicaragua have been resolved, and
the overall threat of communist expansion has diminished.  As a
result, U.S.-directed counterinsurgency and intelligence activities
have ended.  The changed political condition from the time that JTF-B
was established is reflected in the April 1994 congressional
testimony of the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American
Affairs.  The Assistant Secretary stated &quot;the United States is no
longer compelled to base foreign policy strategy on defending the
United States and its neighbors from external aggression.  Instead,
foreign policy can now be focused on encouraging democracy and
promoting economic growth.&quot;

When questioned about the continuing need for a military presence in
light of new U.S.  goals and the relative stability in the region,
military officials at Soto Cano and the Southern Command said that
the military presence at Soto Cano contributes to U.S.  efforts to
promote democracy.  According to these officials, the military
personnel at Soto Cano serve as an example of a military force that
is subordinate to civilian control, a main tenet of democracy. 
However, the officials stated that the influence exerted by the U.S. 
military at Soto Cano was incidental and difficult to quantify. 

According to State Department officials, the principal U.S.  programs
to promote democratic initiatives and military professionalism are
administered by other U.S.  agencies such as the State Department,
the Agency for International Development, the Department of Justice,
and the Defense Security Assistance Agency.  Further, the continuing
U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano appears inconsistent with the
current goal of the U.S.  Embassy in Honduras--which is to reduce the
overall size and scope of U.S.  activities in Honduras in recognition
of declining U.S.  funding and increased political stability in the
region.  Moreover, the United States is also encouraging the
government of Honduras to implement military reforms, which include
reducing its armed forces. 


   U.S.  MILITARY PRESENCE IS NOT
   NEEDED TO SUPPORT MILITARY
   TRAINING ACTIVITIES
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

Since the end of the Cold War, the primary missions of JTF-B are to
support joint, combined and interagency operations, and provide
logistical support for military training exercises, and to maintain
and operate an all-weather, C-5 capable airfield.  While the U.S. 
military presence at Soto Cano is useful and convenient, it is not
essential to support military training activities in the region. 
U.S.  military personnel are routinely deployed throughout Latin
America for training missions without a dedicated, semipermanent U.S. 
logistics and support base like Soto Cano.  According to DOD records,
in 1993 over 60,000 U.S.  active and reserve military personnel were
deployed from the United States and other locations to conduct a
variety of training and civic assistance activities throughout Latin
America.  About 5,500 of the 60,000 participated in training
activities conducted in Honduras.  In discussions on a draft of this
report, DOD officials provided us with figures for fiscal year 1994
training.  These figures show that JTF-B provided support to 10,665
personnel, which is 89 percent of the total deployed in Central
America.  However, the types and levels of support provided by JTF-B
to the various training exercises were not available.  According to
DOD officials, the number of personnel trained in Central America is
approximately 17 percent of all personnel deployed from the United
States and other locations to Latin America. 

Training activities conducted in Latin America included engineering
exercises to drill wells, build roads, schools, and medical clinics;
medical exercises to provide basic medical, dental, and veterinary
care; and combined exercises with host nation forces, such as
computer-simulated war exercises and counterterrorist training. 

JTF-B and the other U.S.  military units stationed at Soto Cano
provide support to these types of training exercises conducted in
Honduras.  For example, in support of an engineering exercise
conducted in Honduras in 1993, U.S.  military personnel at Soto Cano

performed liaison functions with Honduran military and local
government officials,

assisted U.S.  reserve units in awarding contracts to procure
services and supplies on the local economy, and

transported and accompanied advance teams to identify suitable
locations for base camps and inspected training sites during the
exercise. 

The U.S.  military at Soto Cano also often provides limited support
(such as supplies and communication support) to training exercises in
Belize, Guatemala, and El Salvador.  For example, military personnel
at Soto Cano provided and transported tents to a National Guard
training site in Guatemala when the Guard's shipment of tents was
delayed. 

Currently, assets from Soto Cano are being used to support demining
training under the operational control of the U.S.  Military Group
(USMILGP) in Honduras for Brazilian, Costa Rican, and Honduran
troops.  JTF-B also recently provided assistance to the USMILGP in El
Salvador in the coordination of air operations for the Fuertes
Caminos exercise. 

Officials from the U.S.  Army Reserve and National Guard said that
the support they receive from U.S.  military forces at Soto Cano
makes training more convenient but that the training can be
accomplished without a U.S.  military presence.  Since 1992, the Army
National Guard and Army Reserve have increased their training
deployments to other Central American countries, especially El
Salvador and Guatemala.  In these countries, intergovernmental
coordination for logistical support is provided by U.S.  military
personnel attached to the Embassy; personnel deployed in advance of
the training; post-exercise evaluation teams; and in some cases, the
host nation military, according to U.S.  Army Reserve and National
Guard officials. 

In a March 1994 memorandum on the review of the requirement for
JTF-B, to the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA), the Army staff
concluded that training activities in the region could continue
without support from U.S.  military personnel at Soto Cano. 
According to the memorandum training exercises in the region can be
supported from bases located in the United States without the support
of an &quot;expensive, semi-permanent, logistics base.&quot; The memorandum
states that the costs to support training exercises in Honduras
exceed the benefits and the resources could be better used elsewhere
to meet other Army operational requirements.  Further, the Army Chief
of Staff indicated to the Commander in Chief (CINC), USSOUTHCOM, and
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a message, that
reducing or eliminating the Army's support requirement for JTF-B
would represent an important savings to the Army.  Furthermore, we
reported in November 1993 and testified in April 1994 that some DOD
humanitarian and civic action projects were not designed to
contribute to foreign policy objectives, did not appear to enhance
U.S.  military training, and either lacked the support of the country
or were not used.\2

According to DOD officials, the CINC, USSOUTHCOM, considered the
CSA's concerns about the need for JTF-B.  The CINC's position is that
JTF-B could be reduced, but that access to Soto Cano, with its C-5
capable airfield and a U.S.  presence, is needed to accomplish
USSOUTHCOM's mission, which includes conducting various military and
humanitarian operations, training, and providing support for
exercises in the Central American region.

   U.S.  MILITARY SUPPORT AT SOTO
   CANO TO COUNTERDRUG ACTIVITIES
   IS MINIMAL
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

U.S.  military personnel at Soto Cano provide support to the U.S. 
Customs Service, the U.S.  Navy, and the DEA counterdrug programs in
the region.  However, the level of support is minimal and involves
only a small portion of the U.S.  military personnel and equipment at
Soto Cano.  U.S.  Customs, U.S.  Navy, and DEA officials
characterized the support they receive from the U.S.  military at
Soto Cano as useful and convenient, but not critical to their
counterdrug programs. 


      MINIMAL SUPPORT TO CUSTOMS
      COUNTERDRUG ACTIVITIES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1

Honduras is an ideal location for U.S.  Customs to intercept and
track suspect drug-trafficking aircraft.  The U.S.  Customs Service
has two airplanes and eight personnel stationed at Soto Cano to
intercept and track planes suspected of carrying drugs in the Central
American region and over the eastern Pacific Ocean.  Customs provides
housing for its personnel at the base and its mechanics maintain
their counterdrug planes, but receives utilities and other support
services through the U.S.  military and can use U.S.  military
facilities, such as the dining hall. 

In addition, Customs purchases airplane fuel from U.S.  military
supplies and receives ground and air operations support, such as air
traffic control and weather reports from U.S.  military at Soto Cano. 
The U.S.  military presence at the base provides Customs with a
secure environment and operational capability 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week.  According to the U.S.  Air Force commander at the base,
about 130 personnel are involved in airfield operations.  However,
Customs counterdrug flights accounted for only a small percentage of
the total flights handled by these personnel.  For example, Customs'
aircraft accounted for about 8 percent of total U.S.  fixed-wing
flights from Soto Cano between July 1993 and May 1994--an average of
16 times per month.  During the 9-month period, April to December
1993, Interagency Counterdrug Assessment data shows that Customs'
aircraft based at Soto Cano participated in intercepting/tracking 32
trafficking aircraft, which resulted in 13 cocaine seizures. 

Customs officials said their counterdrug operations could continue at
Soto Cano without assistance from the U.S.  military if support were
obtained from the Honduran military and/or contractors. 
Additionally, Customs officials told us that if they did not have
access to Soto Cano, they could use aircraft based in Panama, Mexico,
or other locations to monitor areas now covered by the aircraft at
Soto Cano.  However, the officials also said that this option would
decrease the effectiveness of operations because Customs' aircraft
would always be in a &quot;catch-up&quot; mode rather than an intercept mode. 
We note that Customs carries out similar activities in Mexico and
other locations without a U.S.  military presence.  Notwithstanding
the current Customs' arrangement with USSOUTHCOM\3 for use of the
Soto Cano Base facilities, arrangements to provide for Customs use of
civilian airport facilities for antidrug activities--without a U.S. 
military presence--may be possible as has been done in Mexico
according to Customs officials.  This would require the governments
of the United States and Honduras to negotiate and establish
appropriate arrangements. 


--------------------
\3 The arrangement is based upon a memorandum of understanding
between the U.S.  Customs Service and USSOUTHCOM, dated September 14,
1990.  The purpose of this memorandum is to facilitate and implement
cooperation and coordination for the detection and monitoring of
maritime and aerial transit of illegal drugs through the USSOUTHCOM's
area of responsibility into the United States. 


      NAVY USES SOTO CANO
      INFREQUENTLY
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.2

The Navy uses Soto Cano in its counterdrug operations, which involve
detecting and monitoring suspected drug planes.  U.S.  military
flight records at Soto Cano showed that Navy counterdrug planes
landed at Soto Cano on average 11 times a month from July 1993
through May 1994.  Two Navy P-3 counterdrug planes based in Panama
sometimes use Soto Cano for refueling or as a temporary base for
their operations.  The aircraft refuel at Soto Cano and receive
ground and air operations support similar to the support provided to
Customs.  Navy personnel are sometimes housed at Soto Cano during 2-
to 3-day stopovers. 

Navy officials said that due to intercept geometry limitations, in
order for the Navy P-3 aircraft to provide a constant air intercept
capability, they must be staged at a Central American site.  The
optimum location for staging is north of Costa Rica but south of
Mexico.  Currently, Soto Cano is the only air base with U.S. 
aviation support that fits that description.  These officials further
added that due to excessive transit distance from other P-3 bases, a
Central American base is required to conduct maritime patrols in the
southwestern Caribbean and eastern Pacific.  When Howard Air Force
Base closes, Soto Cano will be the only base in Central America that
has U.S.  aviation support.  According to DOD officials, if the U.S. 
presence at Soto Cano is discontinued, P-3s could potentially
continue to stage out of there or other bases in the region if the
appropriate operating agreement can be made with the host nation. 
However, in considering options associated with the possible
elimination of the U.S.  presence at Soto Cano, the effectiveness of
the Navy's P-3 interdiction efforts should be considered.  Our prior
work has raised serious questions about the cost-effectiveness of
DOD's surveillance efforts in the drug war.\4

      DEA RECEIVES LIMITED SUPPORT
      FROM U.S.  MILITARY AT SOTO
      CANO
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.3

A part of DEA's mission is to assist local law enforcement agencies
with counterdrug investigations, intelligence, and other activities. 
The 4th Battalion, 228th Aviation Regiment, at Soto Cano occasionally
provides helicopter transport to DEA agents and Honduran law
enforcement officers for counterdrug operations.\5 These missions
have involved transporting agents to investigate drug seizures
(post-seizure investigation), reconnaissance, drug eradication, and
training for Honduran law enforcement officers. 

At the time of our fieldwork, the helicopter battalion had 33
helicopters: 
15 Blackhawk, 10 Huey, and 8 Chinook helicopters.  From October 1992
through March 1994, the battalion provided transportation support to
DEA about once a month, typically transporting two DEA and three
Honduran agents.  This accounts for only a small portion of the
helicopter battalion's total flying hours.  For example, during
fiscal year 1993, DEA air transport totaled 91.3 flying hours, or
only 1.2 percent of the helicopter battalion's total flying hours. 
The remaining 98.8 percent of the helicopter flying hours went for a
variety of missions such as pilot proficiency training, humanitarian
and civic action exercises, and general support for U.S.  military
groups and embassies in the region. 

DEA officials characterized the helicopter battalion's flight support
as convenient.  They said that DEA operations in Honduras could be
conducted with one Chinook and two Blackhawk helicopters.  However,
DEA officials noted they have other options to meet their needs for
air transportation.  These include chartering planes, which they have
done in the past, or using U.S.  helicopters based in Guatemala. 


--------------------
\5 DEA is authorized to request DOD assistance for its counterdrug
operations by section 1004 of the fiscal year 1991 National Defense
Authorization Act, as amended (P.L.  101-510). 


   SOTO CANO NOT A VIABLE OPTION
   TO HOWARD AIR BASE
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6

U.S.  military and diplomatic officials told us that another reason
to maintain a U.S.  presence at Soto Cano is the pending U.S. 
withdrawal from Panama by the end of 1999, that will result in the
loss of Howard Air Force Base.  These officials stated that it is
important to retain access to an airfield in the region that is
operated by U.S.  military personnel.  Without a U.S.  military
presence at Soto Cano or Panama, officials said the United States
would no longer control or have immediate access to an airfield in
Latin America for contingency purposes.  They stated, however, that
this is not reason enough to justify continuing the U.S.  presence. 
They also acknowledged that it was unlikely that the United States
would become involved in a major military conflict in Latin America. 

Maintaining a U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano does not guarantee
continued access to the base because the United States has no base
rights or status of forces agreements with the government of
Honduras.  According to some Honduran officials we met with, the
Honduran constitution prohibits the permanent basing of foreign
troops in Honduras, which would limit U.S.  options with respect to
future missions at Soto Cano.  The 1954 Military Assistance Treaty
between the United States and Honduras was the basis for military
cooperation and assistance during the Cold War.  Subsequent annexes
and protocols to the 1954 agreement provided for the establishment of
U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano.  U.S.  and Honduran officials
characterize the agreement allowing a U.S.  military presence at Soto
Cano as a &quot;handshake&quot; agreement, which either side could decide to
break at any time. 

In fact, the current U.S.  presence has become a source of political
controversy.  Some Honduran government officials question the need
for the U.S.  military at Soto Cano and the adequacy of the
arrangement for this presence.  The Honduran President, the Chief of
the Armed Forces, and leaders of the Honduran Congress have called
for an examination of the terms and conditions of the U.S.  presence
because the reasons for its establishment no longer exist. 

Finally, continuation of the U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano
will require recurring renovation and upgrade construction of some
facilities and environmental issues will need to be addressed.\6 For
example, the waste water treatment system is not adequate for the
current U.S.  presence. 


--------------------
\6 JTF-B envisions providing proactive environmental leadership and
began using environmental compliance assessment system inspections in
April 1993 to establish a baseline program.  They have begun to
identify and prioritize requirements and funding sources.  Additional
full-time staffing is required for this program. 


   COST TO MAINTAIN U.S.  PRESENCE
   AT SOTO CANO BASE
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7

We did not attempt to establish firm estimates of cost savings that
would result from discontinuing the U.S.  presence at Soto Cano
because there were too many unknowns.  For example, we did not know
how current activities at Soto Cano would be dispersed to other DOD
installations and whether they would continue at the same level. 
Similarly, we did not have a firm basis for estimating the costs that
Customs would incur with a different support arrangement for its
mission.  However, since about 83 percent of training exercises in
the region take place without assistance from U.S.  forces at Soto
Cano, there are other DOD units and bases that provide similar
support and they could take on the support role currently performed
by JTF-B.  Thus, we infer that DOD resources (i.e., human, financial,
supplies and equipment, and contracts and fees) associated with base
operations and maintenance could be eliminated and costs would either
decline and/or shift to other agencies.  Table 1 shows the direct
costs associated with maintaining the U.S.  military presence for
fiscal year 1994.

   RECOMMENDATION
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8

The reason that the U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano was
established no longer exists and this presence is not critical to
current missions.  In light of budget constraints and current efforts
to increase the cost-effectiveness of DOD's worldwide operations, we
question whether the U.S.  military presence at Soto Cano is
justified.  Therefore, we recommend that

the Secretary of Defense reduce U.S.  military personnel at Soto Cano
to the level necessary to support counterdrug activities, pending the
development of other arrangements to support those counterdrug
activities;

the Commissioner of the U.S.  Customs Service, the Administrator of
DEA, the Secretaries of State and Defense, in conjunction with the
Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, develop a
plan to conduct their operations without U.S.  military units at Soto
Cano; and

the Secretary of Defense withdraw the remaining U.S.  military
personnel at Soto Cano once the interagency plan is developed and
implemented. 


   AGENCY COMMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :9

In its comments on a draft of this report, DOD stated that they have
already begun reducing U.S.  military personnel at Soto Cano to the
levels necessary for USSOUTHCOM to carry out JTF-B's restructured
mission, which was formally approved on November 18, 1994, after the
completion of our audit work.  DOD plans to reduce the number of
helicopters from 33 to 11 and personnel from the April 1994 level of
780 to 499 by October 1995.  DOD said that if JTF-B were eliminated,
it would cost units deploying to the region about $8.2 million per
year to provide the command and control and logistics support for
most exercises in the Central American countries at the fiscal year
1993-94 level.  No details were provided as to how the $8.2-million
estimate was established or its relevance to the total cost of the
U.S.  presence at Soto Cano.  DOD stated that continued U.S. 
military operations at Soto Cano are important to ensure effective
forward presence and to execute peacetime operations in the Central
American region.  They responded that any further restructuring of
DOD activities at Soto Cano should await decisions that are pending
on the relocation of USSOUTHCOM headquarters.  DOD's response and
comments are in
appendix II. 

The Department of State generally agreed with the information in the
draft report but expressed concern about its timing and the political
signal that might be perceived by the Latin American region if JTF-B
were to be terminated.  The U.S.  Customs Service, DEA, and the
Office of National Drug Control Policy generally agreed with the
information contained in the draft report.  Informal comments
received from the agencies during discussions on a draft of this
report have been included where appropriate. 


   SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
----------------------------------------------------------- Letter :10

We interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense,
the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the State Department, the
U.S.  Customs Service, DEA, and the Army National Guard Readiness
Bureau, all in the Washington, D.C., area.  We also met with the Army
Reserve Command Headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and the U.S. 
Atlantic Command in Norfolk, Virginia.  We obtained additional
information related to the costs of maintaining the presence at the
base from Air Force Air Combat Command Headquarters in Langley,
Virginia, and the Army Forces Command Headquarters in Atlanta,
Georgia. 

In Panama, we met with officials from the USSOUTHCOM, including U.S. 
Army South, and the U.S.  Customs Service and DEA.  In Honduras, we
visited the U.S.  military installation at Soto Cano and interviewed
the Commander, JTF-B; the Commander, 4th Battalion, 228th Aviation
Regiment; and other military personnel assigned to the base.  We also
met with the U.S.  Ambassador to Honduras and other embassy
officials, including the Commander of the USMILGP, the Defense
Attache, and the DEA Country Attache.  Additionally, we interviewed
former and present Honduran government and military officials
regarding the U.S.  military presence in Honduras.  We did not assess
the effectiveness of the programs that are supported by JTF-B and the
other U.S.  military units at the base. 

We conducted our review between October 1993 and June 1994 in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. 


--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :10.1

We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Defense,
State, and Treasury; the Attorney General; the Commissioner of U.S. 
Customs; the Administrator of DEA; the Directors of the Office of

<img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">

The continental air defense evolved during the Cold War to detect and
intercept Soviet bombers attacking North America via the North Pole.
GAO concludes that such an air defense is no longer needed and could be
disbanded at an annual savings of as much as $370 million.  Other
reserve and active units are well equipped to handle what has become the
defense force's current focus--intercepting drug smugglers.  The
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended that (1) the
continental air defense be performed by dual tasking active and reserve
general-purpose fighter and training squadrons in the Air Force, the
Navy, and the Marine Corps and (2) the number of Air National Guard
units assigned to this mission be sharply reduced or eliminated.  The
Secretary of Defense's guidance and the Air Force's plan, however,
accomplish only part of what was envisioned by the Chairman, allowing
the Air National Guard to retain an excessive force structure and incur
the associated operating and support costs.

In February 1993, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
recommended that (1) the continental air defense mission be performed
by dual tasking existing active and reserve general-purpose fighter
and training squadrons in the Air Force, the Navy, and the Marine
Corps and (2) the number of Air National Guard units dedicated to
this mission be sharply reduced or eliminated.  As part of our
legislative responsibility, we assessed the viability of the
Chairman's recommendations and the Secretary of Defense's and the Air
Force's responses to those recommendations.  We are reporting to you
because of your committees' jurisdiction over these issues. 


   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

The continental air defense mission evolved during the Cold War to
detect and intercept Soviet bombers attacking North America via the
North Pole.  The continental air defense force that carries out that
mission is within the North American Aerospace Defense Command
(NORAD), which is a joint U.S.  and Canadian command.  The U.S. 
portion of that force is currently comprised of 180 Air National
Guard F-15A/B and F-16A/B aircraft located in 10 units and 14 alert
sites in the United States.  In addition to the 10 dedicated units, 2
F-15 dual-tasked general- purpose units stand alert for NORAD--an
active unit at Elmendorf, Alaska, and an Air National Guard unit at
New Orleans, Louisiana--part of which is on 24-hour alert.  Because
it does not have a wartime mission outside North America, the
continental air defense force is not counted as part of the Air
Force's 26-1/2 fighter wing equivalent base force or the 20 fighter
wing equivalent force recently proposed by the Secretary of Defense
as a result of the Bottom-Up Review.\1 The Air Force currently
budgets about $370 million annually to operate and support the
continental air defense force. 

As required by the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense
Reorganization Act of 1986, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
recommended in early 1993 those role and mission changes necessary to
achieve maximum effectiveness of the military services.  The Chairman
determined that the United States no longer needed a large, dedicated
air defense force because of the near disappearance of the Soviet
threat.  Consequently, the Chairman concluded that the dedicated
force could be significantly reduced or eliminated and that existing
active and reserve general-purpose combat and training forces could
be tasked to perform the continental air defense mission.\2 The
Chairman expected that his recommendations would result in
significant savings in personnel and operating costs.  The analysis
leading to the Chairman's conclusion and recommendations focused on
the forces the United States dedicates to the air defense mission. 
Likewise, this report discusses the roles and missions of the U.S. 
forces and does not include any analysis of Canadian forces. 

The Secretary of Defense viewed the Chairman's recommendations as a
top priority.  The Secretary considered the Chairman's
recommendations and subsequently directed the Air Force to reduce the
force but retain the mission primarily as an Air Force reserve
responsibility.  In response, the Air Force devised a plan to retain
the mission within the Air National Guard as a dedicated force and
reduce that force from 180 aircraft to slightly more than 2 fighter
wing equivalents, thus accomplishing only a portion of what was
envisioned by the Chairman.  The plan, while not formally endorsed by
the Secretary of Defense, is reflected in the Department's fiscal
year 1995 budget submission.

   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

A dedicated continental air defense force is no longer needed.  Since
the threat of a Soviet-style air attack against the United States has
largely disappeared, the air defense force has been focusing its
activities on air sovereignty missions.  Active and reserve
general-purpose and training forces could perform these missions
because they have comparable or more capable aircraft, are located at
or near most existing continental air defense bases and alert sites,
and have pilots capable of performing air sovereignty missions or
being trained to perform such missions. 

The Chairman's recommendations recognize the need to reassign air
sovereignty missions and eliminate or sharply reduce the force now
dedicated to performing those missions to other forces.  The
Secretary's guidance and the Air Force's plan accomplish only a
portion of what was envisioned by the Chairman, as summarized in
table 1.

Full implementation of the Chairman's recommendations would make more
operating and support funds available to sustain general-purpose
forces during this period of declining budget resources.  The
Secretary's guidance and the Air Force's plan, however, would allow
the Air National Guard to retain an excessive force structure and
incur the associated operating and support costs. 


   A DEDICATED CONTINENTAL AIR
   DEFENSE FORCE IS NO LONGER
   NEEDED
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

The former Soviet Union no longer poses a significant threat of a
bomber attack on the continental United States.  Further, internal
problems within Russia and other former Soviet Union countries have
extended the time it would take them to return to previous levels of
military readiness and capabilities.  As a result, dedicated forces
the United States once maintained exclusively to counter a Soviet
attack now concentrate on air sovereignty missions, such as anti-drug
smuggling efforts.  The air sovereignty missions could be reassigned
to other existing reserve or active general-purpose combat or
training units because they (1) have comparable or better aircraft,
(2) are located at or near most existing air defense units or alert
sites, and (3) have pilots that possess similar skills to those used
by air defense and air sovereignty pilots. 


      ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN FOCUSED
      ON AIR SOVEREIGNTY MISSIONS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1

According to the Chairman, the air defense force was structured to
intercept the former Soviet Union's long-range bomber force if it
attacked over the North Pole.  Since that threat has largely
disappeared, the United States no longer needs a dedicated
continental air defense force, and the force has refocused its
activity on the air sovereignty mission, concentrating on
intercepting drug smugglers.  However, anti-drug smuggling activities
at some units and alert sites have been minimal and at others almost
nonexistent.  Overall, during the past 4 years, NORAD's alert
fighters took off to intercept aircraft (referred to as scrambled)
1,518 times, or an average of 15 times per site per year.  Of these
incidents, the number of suspected drug smuggling aircraft averaged
one per site, or less than 7 percent of all of the alert sites' total
activity.\3 The remaining activity generally involved visually
inspecting unidentified aircraft and assisting aircraft in distress. 
Appendix I contains additional information on the scramble activity
at each air defense unit and alert site and on the continental air
defense and air sovereignty missions. 

In September 1993, we reported on the justification for the amount of
flying hours and steaming days the Department of Defense (DOD) uses
in carrying out its drug detection and monitoring role.\4 The report
stated that DOD's efforts were part of a multiagency effort and
concluded that the government's investment does not appear to be
paying off because estimated cocaine flow has not appreciably
declined and most drug smugglers are not interdicted. 


--------------------
\3 These figures relate to all air defense units active during the
4-year period.  Over that time, some sites were closed or operations
were transferred to other locations.

Paying Off (GAO/NSIAD-93-220,

      OTHER RESERVE AND ACTIVE
      UNITS HAVE COMPARABLE OR
      BETTER AIRCRAFT
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.2

General-purpose combat and training forces' aircraft, such as the
F-15C, F-16C, F-14A/A+, and F/A-18A/B/C, are capable of performing
the air defense and air sovereignty missions.  These aircraft are
generally newer and equipped with more advanced avionics than the
dedicated air defense force's F-16As and F-15As, which are the oldest
F-16 and F-15 models in the Air Force's inventory.  For example, the
more modern F-16Cs and F-15Cs have advanced radars that provide
greater range and sharper resolution than those on the F-16A or
F-15A.  Moreover, the F-15C has undergone a multistage improvement
program to enhance other avionics, such as the electronic
countermeasure system and the central computer system, which resulted
in greater data storage capabilities and enhanced processing speed. 
In addition, over 500 fighter aircraft have been designated for
training purposes. 


      LOCATION OF RESERVE AND
      ACTIVE UNITS WOULD ALLOW
      THEM TO CARRY OUT MISSIONS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.3

Current air defense and alert sites are located along U.S.  borders
to provide geographic coverage.  General-purpose and training units
in the active and reserve forces, which are located at about 50 bases
throughout the United States, could support NORAD's coverage
requirements.  In addition, several air defense force alert sites are
collocated with or close to general-purpose and training units. 
Therefore, dual-tasked existing general-purpose and training forces
would also be able to fulfill the air defense and air sovereignty
missions.  Figure 1 and appendix II identify the locations of air
defense units, alert sites, and general-purpose and training units. 

   Figure 1:  Locations of Air
   Defense Units, Alert Sites, and
   Active and Reserve F-14, F-15,
   F-16, and F/A-18 Units

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Some general-purpose and training forces might have to deploy to
other locations to perform their missions.  NORAD currently deploys
some air defense force aircraft to other sites to perform their
duties instead of dual-tasking collocated or nearby general-purpose
units.  For example: 

  The Air Force deploys F-16s from the 158th Fighter Interceptor
     Group at Burlington, Vermont, to Langley Air Force Base,
     Virginia.  Langley is the home of the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing,
     an active unit of 72 F-15Cs--the most technologically advanced
     fighter in the Air Force--and its pilots are trained in the
     air-to-air mission, which closely resembles the air defense
     pilots' training. 

  The 148th Fighter Interceptor Group, Duluth, Minnesota, deploys to
     Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, home of the 325th Fighter Wing. 
     This wing trains F-15 pilots and has 72 F-15C aircraft. 

  The Air Force deploys air defense force F-16As from the 120th
     Fighter Interceptor Group, Great Falls, Montana, to
     Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona.  Davis-Monthan is
     the home of the 162nd Tactical Fighter Group, which has 46 F-16
     aircraft and pilots trained in the air-to-air mission. 


      SKILLS FOR AIR DEFENSE AND
      ACTIVE AND RESERVE PILOTS
      ARE COMPARABLE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.4

The skills required by pilots in the air defense force are, in
several ways, comparable or similar enough to those required by
pilots in general-purpose squadrons.  For example, both
general-purpose and air defense pilots are required to be proficient
in skills such as day or night target intercepts, defense of an area,
aerial gunnery, and quick takeoffs or intercepts.  However, some
skills are unique to either general-purpose or air defense pilots. 
For example, skills needed for composite force training and joint
maritime operations are needed by general-purpose units but are not
necessary for all air defense force pilots.  Likewise, skills such as
slow shadow day or night visual identification are needed by air
defense and air sovereignty pilots so that they can identify and
track unknown aircraft, but these skills are not needed by
general-purpose pilots.  However, despite the missions' unique pilot
requirements, enough training similarities would allow dual-tasked
general-purpose squadrons to accomplish the air defense and air
sovereignty missions. 


   THE CHAIRMAN'S RECOMMENDATIONS
   COULD SAVE COSTS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's recommendations could
result in significant cost savings.  If existing general-purpose and
training forces were tasked to accomplish the air defense and air
sovereignty missions, force structure and associated costs could be
reduced.  The amount of savings would depend on whether the dedicated
air defense units were disbanded or assigned another mission.  If all
the air defense units were disbanded, the Air Force could save as
much as $370 million in annual operation, maintenance, and personnel
costs. 

To accomplish the added responsibility, existing active and reserve
units may need additional resources, such as aircraft for alert
duties.  The cost associated with these aircraft could be offset if a
corresponding dedicated air defense unit were disbanded.  For
example, the dual-tasked F-15 general-purpose unit at the Naval Air
Station, New Orleans, Louisiana, has 24 combat aircraft instead of
the usual 18 aircraft assigned to F-15 units that are not dual
tasked.  These aircraft cost about $46 million annually, or about $6
million more than those in units with 18 aircraft.  However, if dual
tasking a 24-combat aircraft Air National Guard unit would eliminate
a dedicated air defense F-15 unit costing over $42 million, then over
$36 million would be saved. 


   THE AIR FORCE'S PLAN WOULD NOT
   ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT COST
   SAVINGS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

Since the Secretary of Defense's guidance and the Air Force's plan
would retain the air defense mission as a largely dedicated Air
National Guard responsibility and only reduce the dedicated force
structure, significant cost savings would not be achieved.  The Air
Force estimates that its plan to slightly reduce the dedicated force
by retiring some aircraft at each of the 10 Air National Guard units
would save about $36.5 million annually in operations and support
costs.  Thus, the Air Force would still incur significant personnel,
operating, and support costs, since the Air Force would continue to
operate and maintain all 10 dedicated NORAD air defense units.  The
plan, while not formally endorsed by the Secretary of Defense, is
reflected in DOD's fiscal year 1995 budget submission. 


   RECOMMENDATION
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6

We recommend that the Secretary of Defense not approve the Air
Force's plan unless it is modified (1) to eliminate or sharply reduce
the dedicated air defense force and (2) to reassign the air defense
mission to active and reserve general-purpose and training units. 


   AGENCY COMMENTS AND OUR
   EVALUATION
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7

DOD provided comments on a draft of this report, which appear in
appendix III.  Although it mostly concurred with the facts discussed
in the draft report, DOD took issue with some of the analysis and
conclusions drawn from those facts and did not concur with the
recommendation.  In commenting on the draft report, DOD noted that
(1) the Chairman's recommendation was based on an Air Force
consisting of 26-1/2 fighter wings, (2) air sovereignty and a
capacity to regenerate a continental air defense force remain a
critical function of the Air Force, and (3) it has taken steps to
appropriately size the available force. 

According to DOD, the Bottom-Up Review required the Air Force to
maintain forces at a sufficient level to respond to two nearly
simultaneous major regional conflicts and that 20 fighter wings would
be necessary to meet that requirement.  DOD further stated that force
requirements for the air sovereignty mission were not included in the
level required to meet major regional conflicts.  That is, the
analysis supporting the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Roles
and Missions report was based on the Air Force maintaining 26-1/2
fighter wings.  Force structure reductions would result in a decrease
to 20 fighter wings.  Thus, under the most demanding circumstances in
which the Air Force would have to deploy all 20 fighter wings, no
forces would be available to fulfill the air sovereignty mission. 

DOD agreed that eliminating all dedicated air defense units would
result in significant net savings but also noted that some
incremental costs would be incurred in dual tasking other units.  DOD
also commented that a dedicated force capable of performing air
sovereignty missions could help deter illegal airborne activity. 
However, our September 1993 report on drug control efforts noted that
the continental air defense force might be ineffective in detecting,
monitoring, and apprehending drug smugglers because direct
drug-smuggling flights into the United States essentially ended years
ago and jet fighter aircraft cannot effectively track slow,
low-flying, drug-smuggling planes. 

The analysis in the Chairman's Roles and Missions report was clearly
based on the threat of a Soviet-style bomber attack on North America. 
The decline in that threat led to the Chairman's recommendation that
a dedicated continental air defense force was no longer needed. 
However, the Air Force has proposed to maintain essentially the same
framework historically used to defend against a Soviet-style bomber
attack. 

We are not recommending that all capability to protect U.S.  airspace
be eliminated.  We agree with the Chairman's recommendations to
assign the mission to existing Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps
general-purpose and training squadrons and eliminate or sharply
reduce the dedicated forces currently associated with continental air
defense. 

We recognize that the Bottom-Up Review recommended that the Air Force
maintain 20 fighter wings for responding to two nearly simultaneous
major regional conflicts.  However, during peacetime, while most
general-
purpose forces are not deployed, the air sovereignty mission could be
accomplished using general-purpose and training forces.  If the most
demanding circumstances were to arise and all 20 fighter wings were
needed overseas, over 500 nondeployable training forces could be
used, as is now planned, to protect U.S.  airspace.  This is more
than three times the number of aircraft dedicated for that purpose
during peacetime.  DOD provided no evidence that implementing the
recommendation concerning dual tasking general-purpose and training
forces would, under the most demanding circumstances, force the
National Command Authority to choose between deploying insufficient
forces or leaving U.S.  airspace unprotected. 


   SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8

We initiated this review as part of our legislative responsibility
and as a result of findings from our ongoing review of the Air
Force's fighter support aircraft.  We analyzed the air defense
mission in regard to current military and nonmilitary threats, the
availability and compatibility of other forces to be dual tasked to
perform the mission, and the reductions in defense budgets and force
structure. 

We visited the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Office of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Headquarters, Air National Guard
Bureau Headquarters, and Defense Intelligence Agency, all in
Washington, D.C.  Additionally, we visited the North American
Aerospace Defense Command, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado Springs,
Colorado; the Air Combat Command Headquarters, Langley Air Force
Base, Virginia; the Commander of Naval Air Forces Atlantic, Norfolk,
Virginia; the Naval Air Reserves Headquarters, Naval Support
Activity, New Orleans, Louisiana; the 1st Air Force Headquarters,
NORAD's Southeast Sector Operations Control Center, and Air Defense
Forces' F-15 training facilities, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida;
the Air Defense Forces' F-16 training facilities, Kingsley Field,
Klamath Falls, Oregon; and the 159th Fighter Group, Naval Air
Station, New Orleans, Louisiana. 

We also visited the following continental air defense units and alert
sites collocated within the units:  the 102nd Fighter Interceptor
Wing, Otis, Massachusetts; 144th Fighter Interceptor Wing, Fresno,
California;
119th Fighter Interceptor Group, Fargo, North Dakota; 125th Fighter
Interceptor Group, Jacksonville, Florida; 142nd Fighter Interceptor
Group, Portland, Oregon; 148th Fighter Interceptor Group, Duluth,
Minnesota;
147th Fighter Interceptor Group, Ellington, Texas; 158th Fighter
Interceptor Group, Burlington, Vermont; 177th Fighter Interceptor
Group, Atlantic City, New Jersey; and 120th Fighter Interceptor
Group, Great Falls, Montana. 

While NORAD is a joint U.S.-Canadian command, we limited our review
to U.S.  air defense forces only. 

We conducted our review from June 1992 to July 1993 in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards.

THE CONTINENTAL AIR DEFENSE
MISSION'S TRANSITION TO THE
POST-COLD WAR ENVIRONMENT
=========================================================== Appendix I

The protection of continental skies is the responsibility of the
North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which is comprised
of U.S.  and Canadian air forces.  NORAD's mission of continental
protection involves controlling sovereign airspace, assessing and
warning of enemy air or missile attack, and intercepting or engaging
such threats.  This mission is supported by an extensive network of
ground-, air-, and space-based radars, sensors, and satellites, as
well as up-to-date threat intelligence.  NORAD maintains a core force
of air defense fighter squadrons to provide protection in the event
of an attack.  A number of these interceptors are on 24-hour alert at
locations along the U.S.  border to identify and intercept unknown
aircraft or objects.  In addition, two alert sites are located in
Alaska.  The aircraft at these sites are provided by the 3rd Fighter
Wing, a dual-tasked active air force F-15 unit stationed at Elmendorf
Air Force Base, Alaska. 

The continental air defense mission, with its dedicated force,
evolved as a direct result of the growth of the Soviet long-range
bomber fleet in the post-World War II environment and the detonation
of a Soviet atomic bomb in 1949.  NORAD was established in 1957 by
Canada and the United States to intercept any Soviet long-range
bombers attacking over the North Pole.  Canada and the United States
also built three radar networks across the continent to give 2 to 3
hours warning of bomber attacks.  The operation of these extensive
networks required daily coordination on tactical matters and
considerable merging of plans, so an integrated command was
established at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado Springs, Colorado,
to centralize operational control of air defense.  By 1960, NORAD
maintained approximately 1,200 interceptors dedicated to countering
Soviet bombers. 

During the 1960s, the character of the military threat changed as the
Soviets focused on intercontinental and sea-launched ballistic
missiles and developed an anti-satellite capability.  In response,
the United States built a space-based surveillance and
missile-warning system to detect and track airborne threats
worldwide.  NORAD was given responsibility for this system, thereby
adding to its mission the tactical assessment and warning of a
possible air, missile, or space attack on North America. 

The effectiveness of NORAD's air defense system was first questioned
in the early 1960s, when the Soviets shifted reliance from manned
bombers to ballistic missiles.  The Secretary of Defense at that time
believed that current air defenses would limit damage only marginally
in a nuclear attack by long-range ballistic and submarine-launched
missiles.  In his opinion, the existing interceptor force was
excessive in relation to the diminished bomber threat.  On the basis
of this change in threat and on budget considerations, the Department
of Defense (DOD) reduced the number of NORAD interceptors to
approximately 300 aircraft by the mid-1970s. 

With the breakup of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the
Warsaw Pact in 1991, the military threat upon which NORAD had based
its core structure had again changed significantly.  Likewise, the
Cuban threat was declining, and other military threats did not
approach that of the Soviets during the Cold War. 

NORAD recognized this drastic reduction in the military threat and
determined that sufficient warning time existed to reconstitute
forces needed to meet a re-emerging threat of the magnitude of the
former Soviet Union.  Consequently, NORAD revised the justification
for its core forces, emphasizing peacetime air sovereignty. 
According to a recent NORAD strategy review,

&quot;The dramatically changed threat and .  .  .  development of
post-Cold War defense policies suggest real possibilities for
shifting NORAD's focus from deterring massive nuclear attack to
defending both nations [Canada and the United States] by maintaining
air sovereignty .  .  .  .  The size of the core force would equate
to that required to perform the peacetime Air Sovereignty mission.&quot;

NORAD defines air sovereignty as providing surveillance and control
of the territorial airspace, which includes: 

  intercepting and destroying uncontrollable air objects;

  tracking hijacked aircraft;

  assisting aircraft in distress;

  escorting Communist civil aircraft; and

  intercepting suspect aircraft, including counterdrug operations and
     peacetime military intercepts. 

Of these tasks, NORAD considers intercepting drug smugglers the most
serious.  Under 10 U.S.C.  124, DOD is designated the single lead
agency for detecting and monitoring air and maritime shipments of
illegal drugs to the United States.\1

DOD gave NORAD the responsibility for intercepting suspected airborne
drug smugglers.  However, only 7 percent of NORAD fighter intercepts
from 1989-92 were drug related (see table I.1). 

NORAD plans to reduce the number of alert sites in the continental
United States to 14 and provide 28 aircraft for the day-to-day
peacetime air sovereignty mission.  Each alert site will have two
fighters, and their crews will be on 24-hour duty and ready to
scramble within 5 minutes.

<img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">

The number of drug addicts receiving Social Security disability benefits
has soared in recent years; about 250,000 addicts now receive disability
benefits at an annual cost of $1.4 billion. Despite the fact that half
of them qualify for benefits on the basis of their addiction alone, most
addicts are not required to be in treatment.  Finding qualified
representative payees to manage addicts' benefits has been a
long-standing problem for the Social Security Administration.  Most
payees are either friends or relatives.  In the absence of tight
controls, addicts are free to buy drugs and alcohol to maintain their
addictions.  GAO believes that organizational payees would be in a
better position to provide the strict controls needed over benefit
payments to addicts.

<h1>Child Welfare: Complex Needs Strain Capacity to Provide

<pre>
<font size="2">(Letter Report, 09/26/95, GAO/HEHS-95-208).
<img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">


GAO reviewed the foster care system and related child welfare services,
focusing on: (1) recent trends in the characteristics of the foster care
population; (2) whether resources for foster care and child welfare
services have kept pace with changing needs; and (3) how states are
responding to current foster care and other service needs.

GAO found that: (1) the sharp increase in the number of child abuse and
neglect reports and foster care caseloads have increased the demand for
child welfare services and have greatly restricted resources for those
services; (2) resource constraints have resulted in restrictions on the
use of federal foster care funds, diversion of funds to child abuse and
neglect investigations, caseworker recruiting and retention problems,
shortages of foster parents, and difficulties in obtaining outside
services; (3) states have adopted various cost saving methods to meet
their service needs while protecting children; (4) family preservation
services and kinship care reduce costs while maintaining family ties;
(5) specialized foster care for emotionally disturbed and medically
fragile children is less costly than institutionalization; and (6) while
proposed legislation creating a block grant for child welfare services
and foster care would give states greater flexibility in allocating
funds to match needs and reduce administrative costs, Congress must
consider provisions that reflect lessons learned from earlier attempts
to provide block grants for child welfare services.

In 1993, more than 1 million American children suffered some abuse or
neglect.\1 One in six of these children were removed from home for
their protection and temporarily placed in foster care.  Both the
children remaining home and those placed in foster care were eligible
for services to help them deal with their family situation, obtain
medical treatment, or meet other critical needs.  By the end of 1993,
an estimated 450,000 children were in foster care, more than in any
other year since the mid-1970s. 

States provide the majority of funds for foster care and child
welfare services.  Even so, the federal share of expenditures reached
$4.1 billion in 1995.  These federal funds come primarily from two
sources, one an open-ended entitlement and the other limited to
annual appropriations.  Under title IV-E of the Social Security Act,
open-ended funds are available to states for the maintenance (food,
shelter, and incidentals) of all foster children meeting certain
income and other criteria.  Title IV-B of the act provides separate
funds to states for child welfare services for abused and neglected
children who remain in their homes or are placed in foster care. 
These services include helping families to resolve their problems and
referring families for specialized help, such as substance abuse
treatment. 

The Congress is currently considering sweeping changes to programs
designed to support children and families.  Among these changes is a
proposal to replace many child welfare programs, including foster
care, with a block grant.  To assist the Congress in its
deliberations, this report presents an overview of the foster care
system and related child welfare services.  Specifically, we address
the following questions: 

  What are recent trends in the characteristics of the foster care
     population? 

  Have resources for foster care and child welfare services kept pace
     with changing needs? 

  How are states responding to current foster care and other service
     needs? 

To develop this information, we drew upon our past reports on foster
care and related child welfare issues (see list of Related GAO
Products in app.  V) and reviewed reports by government and other
organizations as well as position papers and written testimony from
witnesses at congressional hearings.  In addition, we interviewed
national experts and researchers in the child welfare area, child
welfare advocates, representatives of public interest groups,
government officials in selected states and localities, and federal
officials (see app.  I).  Our work was performed between March and
July 1995. 


--------------------
\1 The most recent year for which data are available is 1993. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

Between 1983 and 1993, sharp increases in the number of foster
children combined with unprecedented service needs led to a crisis in
foster care.  Reports of child abuse and neglect nearly doubled, and
foster care caseloads grew by two-thirds.  Demands for child welfare
services grew not only because the number of foster children
increased but also because families and children were more troubled
and had more complex needs than in the past.  In Los Angeles County,
New York City, and Philadelphia County, for example, 29 percent of
preschool-age foster children in 1986 were at risk of health problems
due to prenatal drug exposure; this rose to 62 percent in 1991. 

Meanwhile, resources for child welfare services failed to keep pace
with the needs of troubled children and their families.  While foster
care funding has increased dramatically at all levels of government,
federal funding for child welfare services has lagged.  States and
localities have found it difficult to meet the demand, although they
have more than tripled expenditures in some cases.  Federal foster
care funds generally cannot be transferred to support child welfare
services, and available state funds are increasingly being spent on
child abuse and neglect investigations.  The effect has been to
further constrain resources for preventive and rehabilitative child
welfare services that offer some promise of containing growth in
foster care caseloads. 

Faced with increasing demands and limited resources, states have
adopted various measures to meet the needs of troubled children and
their families while maintaining children's safety.  Many states now
offer family preservation services or place children with relatives
to maintain family ties and save money.  States are also increasingly
considering the use of specialized foster homes for children with
unique problems, including emotionally disturbed and medically
fragile children, to provide more family-like care at lower costs
than institutions, where such children are typically placed.  If
states can save foster care costs, they may be able to transfer state
funds to support child welfare services. 


   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

Foster care is an integral part of a child welfare system designed to
ensure the safety and well-being of children whose families are not
providing adequate care for them.  Foster care provides primarily
food and housing to meet the physical needs of children who are
removed from their homes.  Child welfare services are designed to
address the complex family problems associated with children's abuse,
neglect, exploitation, or delinquency.  In providing child welfare
services, caseworkers may also refer children and their families to
mental health agencies, medical facilities, or elsewhere for
specialized treatment and services. 

Child welfare services are critical in helping prevent the need for
foster care as well as in achieving appropriate and stable permanent
living arrangements for children placed in foster care.  Most states
and counties provide some child welfare services directly and
purchase others from private agencies.  Available services vary
considerably from one area to another in number, type, intensity, and
duration, although calls and visits with caseworkers are considered
essential in most areas. 

Children generally enter foster care for their own protection because
their parents will not or cannot take care of them.\2 When problems
such as abuse or neglect are identified, the child welfare system may
intervene with services designed to improve the situation and avoid
removing children from their homes.  If such services cannot ensure
children's safety and well-being in their homes, the child welfare
system petitions the court to place children in foster care, either
in the homes of relatives or nonfamily foster parents, group homes,
or institutions. 

Foster care provided by relatives, who are often grandmothers, is
known as kinship care.  States may choose whether to license
relatives as foster parents and provide foster care payments.  On the
other hand, states require nonfamily foster parents to be licensed
and pay them an average of $8 to $15 a day per child for food,
housing, and incidental expenses.  States also license group homes
and institutions to provide care by paid staff.  These homes receive
an average of $100 a day per child for food, housing, and overhead
expenses.\3 Foster care is a temporary solution until children can be
returned safely to their parents, adopted, or placed in some other
permanent living arrangement; however, some children remain in foster
care until their eligibility for foster care assistance expires,
generally at age 18. 

Under federal law, states must provide foster care if they
participate in Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), the
largest federal welfare program providing cash assistance to poor
families.  States receive federal matching funds for about half of
all foster children because these children would have qualified for
AFDC had they remained in their homes.  For the other half, states
and localities are the sole source of government support.  In
addition, states and localities supply the majority of government
funds for child welfare services.  Many states directly administer
foster care and child welfare, but nearly one-third delegate this
authority to their counties, including several states with the
largest caseloads--California, Pennsylvania, and New York. 

Two titles under the Social Security Act provide federal funding
targeted specifically to foster care and related child welfare
services.\4 (See app.  II.) Title IV-E provides an open-ended
individual entitlement for foster care maintenance payments to cover
a portion of the food, housing, and incidental expenses of children
from AFDC-eligible families.  Title IV-E also provides payments to
adoptive parents of eligible minority foster children or others with
special needs, such as health problems, that may make adoptive homes
more difficult to find.  Title IV-B provides limited or &quot;capped&quot;
funding for child welfare services to foster children as well as
children remaining in their homes. 

In 1995, total IV-E funding was $3.6 billion and total IV-B funding
was $453 million, representing about 97 percent of all federal
funding targeted to child welfare and protection, including foster
care.  Another nine programs provided an additional $136 million in
federal funds to states for activities designed to protect the safety
and well-being of children. 

Under the Child Protection Block Grant passed by the House in 1995,
foster care and the other child welfare programs would be replaced by
a single block grant to states with capped funding.  (See apps.  III
and IV.) In addition, proposals for an AFDC block grant would cap
federal funding and repeal AFDC eligibility rules that currently
enable states to claim IV-E foster care funds.  Further, the AFDC
block could affect the amount of federal funds states would receive
for IV-E foster care if it makes certain categories of children
ineligible for AFDC and all children ineligible for AFDC after 5
years of assistance.

   RECENT TRENDS HAVE LED TO A
   FOSTER CARE CRISIS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

Current trends in the number and needs of foster children have led to
a crisis in the child welfare system.  The number of reports of abuse
and neglect and the number of children removed from home and placed
in foster care for their protection have grown alarmingly.  Also,
compared with the foster children of 10 years ago, today's foster
children have characteristics associated with longer stays in foster
care and greater service needs.  Although stays in foster care for
most children are less than 1 year, permanent placements following
foster care are delayed or unstable for a significant minority of
children. 


      REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND
      NEGLECT HAVE INCREASED
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1

An estimated 2.3 million children were reported possible victims of
abuse or neglect in 1993.\5 Although the number of reports has nearly
doubled since 1983, the rate of increase has shown signs of leveling
off since 1990.  The increased reporting has been due, in part, to
heightened public awareness and state laws mandating reports from
professionals who see children on a daily basis.\6

Meanwhile, the incidence of poverty and substance abuse, factors
associated with abuse and neglect, were also at relatively high
levels during this period. 

Upon investigation, child welfare workers confirmed abuse or neglect
of 1 million children in 1993.\7 Although child abuse and neglect are
more likely to be reported today than 10 years ago, whether children
are as likely to be removed from their homes is not clear.  Experts
believe that as a result of increased demands, strained resources,
and efforts to strengthen families, child welfare agencies are
currently reevaluating conditions in the family and neighborhood that
formerly might have been grounds for the child's removal.  Most of
the 1 million abused or neglected children remained in their homes. 
However, about 15 percent were considered in imminent danger and
placed in foster care.  Most children who enter foster care do so
because of abuse; neglect; inadequate care due to parental absence;
or conditions, such as illness or financial difficulty, as shown in
figure 1.

&quot;Status offense/delinquent&quot; includes children who entered care

(2) delinquent behavior.

&quot;Other&quot; includes children who entered care for such reasons as
parent-child relationship problems, child's handicap, a plan for
adoption, deinstitutionalization, and unwed motherhood.

\5 Child Maltreatment 1993:  Reports From the States to the National
Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, Department of Health and Human
Services (Washington, D.C.:  1995). 

\6 Teachers most often reported the abuse or neglect that was most
often perpetrated by parents or other relatives. 

\7 Nearly half of the confirmed cases involved neglect; a quarter,
physical abuse; one-seventh, sexual abuse; and the remainder,
unspecified maltreatment.  About half of the children were under 8
years of age, a quarter under 4.  Neglect was more common among
younger children; physical abuse, among boys under 12 or girls over
12; and sexual abuse, among girls.  (See footnote 5.)


      FOSTER CARE CASELOADS HAVE
      REACHED RECORD LEVELS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.2

By 1993, an estimated 450,000 U.S.  children--more than at any other
time in two decades--were in foster care.  This represents a
two-thirds increase in the foster care caseload since 1983, as shown
in figure 2.  The growth in foster care caseloads occurred because
more children entered than left care in each year between 1983 and
1993.  This trend was especially noticeable between 1987 and 1990,
when the number of children entering care increased the most.  Since
peaking in 1990, the number of children entering care has leveled
off. 

   Figure 2:  Foster Care
   Caseloads, 1983-1993

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Source:  APWA VCIS. 

Meanwhile, the number of foster children who were eligible for
federal matching funds, by virtue of their family's eligibility for
AFDC, grew by a larger percentage than the number of foster children
in general.  In 1993, about half of all children in foster care were
eligible for federal matching funds under title IV-E.  California and
New York, the two states with the largest foster care caseloads,
accounted for one-third of all foster children and much of the
increase in title IV-E eligible children. 


      MORE MINORITY AND YOUNG
      CHILDREN ARE IN CARE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.3

Although trends in the characteristics of foster children vary by
state, since 1983, foster children increasingly have come from
minority groups and have been younger.  The 1990 foster care
population consisted of 40 percent African Americans and 11 percent
Hispanics compared with 39 percent whites.\8 Not only are more
minorities entering, but, once placed in foster care, African
American and Hispanic children remain longer and leave at slower
rates than whites.\9 African American children, in particular, are
disproportionately represented in foster care, as shown in figure 3,
and, if the trend continues, caseloads may increasingly consist of
minority children removed from their homes for prolonged stays in
foster care.

   and African American Children

   edition.)

Sources:  For the general population, U.S.  Census Bureau,
Statistical Abstracts; for the foster care population, APWA VCIS data

Also by 1990, the average median age of children in foster care had
dropped from 12.6 to 8.6 years of age,\10 as the percentage of
preschoolers increased by 50 percent and the percentage of teens
declined (see fig.  4).  The increase in infants entering the system
is particularly striking.  Although the majority of foster children
entered the system between the ages of 1 and 12, the percentage of
children entering care who were under 1 year increased by two-thirds
from 1983 to 1990, leading to a foster care &quot;baby boom.&quot; Further,
infants are staying in foster care longer than any other age group,
and as their time in care increases, their chance of being adopted
decreases.\11

      FOSTER CHILDREN HAVE GREATER
      SERVICE NEEDS THAN IN THE
      PAST
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.4

Children are also entering care from families more troubled than in
the past and with greater emotional, behavioral, and medical needs. 
Such families today more often face economic hardship, substance
abuse, homelessness, mental or physical illness, or the imprisonment
of a family member.  In Los Angeles County, New York City, and
Philadelphia County in 1991, over half of the preschool-age foster
children were estimated to have serious health-related problems,
including developmental delays, low birth weight, heart problems, and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.  An estimated 62
percent of the preschool-age foster children were at risk of serious
health problems due to prenatal drug exposure, more than double the
29 percent at risk of such problems in 1986.\12

Children with these complex needs require a variety of
community-based services and a level of care not required in the
past.  A California study found that foster children were 10 times
more likely to use mental health services than other children on
Medicaid and that they were hospitalized for mental conditions almost
twice as long.\13

For this reason, while foster children constituted only 4 percent of
California children on Medicaid they accounted for 40 percent of all
Medicaid mental health expenditures.

      PERMANENT LIVING
      ARRANGEMENTS FOLLOWING
      FOSTER CARE MAY BE DELAYED
      OR UNSTABLE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.5

Children who leave foster care are increasingly returned home when
caseworkers consider it safe.  About 67 percent of children leaving
care in 1990 returned to their families (see fig.  5), up from 56
percent in 1983.  Meanwhile, the percentage of children adopted
declined from 12 to 8 percent. 

   Figure 5:  Disposition of
   Children Leaving Foster Care,
   1990

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Note:  &quot;Other&quot; includes such reasons as placement with a legal
guardian, marriage, running away, incarceration, death, or discharge
to another public agency. 

Source:  APWA VCIS data from 24 states. 

Although foster care is a relatively short-term experience for many
children, some children remain in care for extended periods.  Of the
children leaving care in 1990, for example, 50 percent had been in
foster care for 8 months or less.  However, of those remaining in
care, over 25 percent had been in foster placements for at least 3
years.  (See fig.  6.) Foster children for whom adoption is
ultimately planned spend an average of 4 to 6 years in foster care,
according to a 1991 report on adoptions in 20 states.\14

   Figure 6:  Length of Stay in
   Foster Care at the End of 1990

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Source:  APWA VCIS data from 22 states. 

The shorter the initial stay in foster care, the more likely it
appears that children who are reunited with their parents will
reenter care.\15 In Los Angeles County and New York City, for
example, 32 percent of children whose initial stay in foster care was
less than 1 year later returned to care, compared with 16 percent of
children whose initial stay was 1 year or longer. 

Youths who leave foster care at age 18 because they are no longer
eligible may experience unstable and troubled lives.  A study
conducted 2.5 to 4 years after youths left foster care found that 46
percent had not completed high school, 38 percent had not held a job
for more than 1 year, 25 percent had been homeless for at least one
night, and 60 percent of young women had given birth to a child.\16
Forty percent had been on public assistance, incarcerated, or a cost
to the community in some other way.

   RESOURCES HAVE NOT KEPT PACE
   WITH SERVICE NEEDS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

The child welfare system has been under great pressure to meet
increased demands.  States and localities provide the majority of
funding for foster care and child welfare services.  From 1983 to
1993, rising caseloads have increased federal, state, and local
expenditures for foster care dramatically, leaving proportionately
less for child welfare services.  Federal foster care funds cannot be
used to pay for most child welfare services, and available state
funds are increasingly required for investigations of abuse and
neglect reports.  As a result, states have found it difficult to
ensure that child welfare services are sufficiently funded to meet
needs.  Other resource constraints have included problems recruiting
and retaining caseworkers, shortages of available foster parents, and
difficulties obtaining needed services from systems outside the
control of child welfare. 


      FOSTER CARE EXPENDITURES
      HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY
      AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1

With increasing foster care caseloads, expenditures for the basic
needs of foster children and program administration have risen
dramatically at all levels of government.  Federal expenditures grew
faster than state expenditures in three of the largest states from
1983 to 1993.  Nevertheless, as of 1990, states and localities
continued to fund about 65 percent of all foster care. 

Federal costs of foster care maintenance increased by over 350
percent (see table 1) from 1983 to 1993 in California and New York,
which approaches the nationwide increase of nearly 400 percent for
this period.  (See fig.  7.)

   Figure 7:  Expenditures for
   Title IV-E Foster Care
   Maintenance and Title IV-B

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Source:  Overview of Entitlement Programs; 1994 Green Book, Committee
on Ways and Means, U.S.  House of Representatives. 

The rapid rise in federal foster care expenditures has been linked to
several simultaneous developments:  States have increased efforts to
determine children's eligibility for federal funds; more children
have become eligible under AFDC rules for IV-E assistance; and
payments to providers have increased in most states.  Further,
federal administrative costs\17 have increased over the same period
as states have increasingly emphasized the case management and
placement activities required by federal law (see app.  IV) and
sought full reimbursement for these activities.  By 1993, nearly $1.1
billion in IV-E reimbursement went to states for foster care
administrative activities, almost as much as the $1.3 billion that
went for foster care maintenance in that year.\18

At the state level, foster care expenditures also rose between 1983
and 1993.  For example, California and New York increased
expenditures for foster care maintenance payments by about 200
percent, while Michigan's expenditures doubled, as shown in table
1.\19

Because of fiscal difficulties states experienced in the early
1990s,\20 they looked to localities and the federal government to
assume greater shares of foster care costs.  California, Michigan,
and New York, for example, are among the states that increased the
portion of foster care maintenance payments supported by local funds. 
Faced with a $14 billion budget deficit in 1992, California increased
counties' portion of foster care maintenance payments by 1,100
percent.

      AVAILABLE FUNDING AND
      COMPETING DEMANDS CONSTRAIN
      CHILD WELFARE SERVICES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.2

Available funding and competing demands from other activities have
constrained resources available for child welfare services.  Despite
increasing appropriations, the federal government spent about $.12 on
child welfare services in 1993 for every $1 it spent on foster care,
as compared with about $.40 in 1983.  While states and localities
have continued to provide the majority of funds for child welfare
services, they have found it increasingly difficult to maintain
sufficient funding levels to ensure that needs are met. 

At the national level, title IV-B appropriations increased 88 percent
from 1983 through 1993, lagging behind increases in federal foster
care maintenance costs, as shown in figure 7.\21 Increases in federal
expenditures for child welfare services also lagged behind state and
local expenditure growth during this period. 

State and local expenditures for services rose dramatically from the
early 1980s to the early 1990s and represented over half of all
funding as of 1990.  In California, Michigan, and New York, state and
local expenditures for child welfare services increased by over 200
percent (see table 1).  Meanwhile, federal IV-B funding for
California and Michigan increased at half these rates and in New York
actually decreased by 14 percent. 

Although federal law requires the provision of direct child welfare
services to children and families, these services generally cannot be
supported with federal funds designated for foster care.\22 Available
state funds, meanwhile, have been stretched to the limit to cover
increasing demands from other activities.  Most notably, rising
reports of abuse and neglect have led states to devote more resources
to investigating reports, leaving less for providing services. 

Because of constrained resources and competing demands, states have
not been able to ensure that child welfare services are sufficient to
meet needs.  For example, an APWA survey of agencies in every state
found that services were limited and generally involved managing,
rather than treating, families and their abused or neglected
children.  Since 1987, children's advocates have successfully filed
class action lawsuits on behalf of children against eight states,
obtaining court orders to improve child welfare services, and similar
cases are pending in other states.\23


--------------------
\21 The Congress authorized a new IV-B program for family
preservation and support services designed to prevent the need for
foster care and appropriated $60 million for start-up activities in
1994. 

\22 AFDC funds for emergency assistance to families have been used
for services, particularly since 1993.  See Review of Rising Costs in
the Emergency Assistance Program, Department of Health and Human
Services, Office of the Inspector General (Washington, D.C.:  1995). 

\23 The eight states are Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, District of
Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, and Utah. 


      SHORTAGES OF CASEWORKERS AND
      FOSTER PARENTS FURTHER
      STRAIN SERVICE DELIVERY
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.3

Next to funding, states report that staffing is the most serious
issue facing their child welfare systems.  In response to an APWA
survey, 90 percent of states reported difficulty recruiting and
retaining caseworkers.  Caseworkers are at the heart of the foster
care system, visiting children and families in their homes and
arranging services to help prevent the need to remove children from
their homes, or, in case of their removal, to find permanent living
arrangements for foster children.  Caseworkers also coordinate
contacts among families and children with health, mental health, and
other service systems. 

State officials attributed difficulties in recruiting and retaining
caseworkers to several factors, including hiring freezes, low pay,
and poor working conditions.  These factors, in turn, led to staff
shortages, high caseloads, and high burnout and turnover rates among
caseworkers.  In some jurisdictions, caseloads have reached 100 cases
per caseworker, well above the 25 per caseworker recommended by the
National Association of Social Workers.  In New York City, annual
turnover rates for caseworkers have been as high as 75 percent, so
that each year most foster children, who have suffered from unstable
families, get a new caseworker. 

Foster parents are the other essential component of an effective
service delivery system, but the supply of foster parents has lagged
behind the growth in the foster care caseload.  While the number of
children in foster care has increased, the number of foster homes has
decreased.\24

Child welfare experts attribute this growing shortage of foster homes
to several factors, including the poor public image of foster care,
low reimbursement rates, inadequate support services, greater
difficulties caring for today's more troubled foster children, and
increased employment opportunities for women.  In some states, the
shortage of foster homes is so great that children are placed in
temporary shelters or shuttled from one place to another until a
proper home can be found, according to the National Foster Parent
Association. 


--------------------
\24 See Foster Parents:  Recruiting and Preservice Training Practices
Need Evaluation (GAO/HRD-89-86, Aug.  3, 1989). 


      FRAGMENTED SERVICE DELIVERY
      SYSTEM EXACERBATES PROBLEM
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.4

Difficulties providing families and children with services also arise
because many needs must be met by services, such as medical care and
drug treatment, that are outside the control of the child welfare
system.  Rarely does a single state or local agency have control over
the full array of services required to address the needs of
increasingly troubled children and families who have many problems. 
Rather, a complex set of service delivery systems must be tapped;
these are usually linked to separate categorical funding sources and
different eligibility criteria. 

Because caseworkers may be overworked and families may often lack the
sophistication and resources necessary to arrange services on their
own behalf, some children and families may experience delays or gaps
in service.  For example, when we visited metropolitan areas in three
states, we found that many foster children under age 3 lacked routine
health examinations and immunizations.\25

The goals of the child welfare system and those of various programs
may also be inconsistent.  For example, caseworkers report that more
parents of abused and neglected children are addicted to drugs than
in the past.  Although one of the primary goals of the current child
welfare system is to keep families together, residential drug
treatment programs are rarely able to accommodate the children of
parents undergoing treatment.  For parents to receive treatment,
therefore, some children must be placed in some kind of foster care.

   STATES STRUGGLE TO MEET
   CASELOAD AND RESOURCE
   CHALLENGES
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

In response to the escalating pressure on the foster care system,
states have adopted various measures to meet changing foster care
needs.  Many states provide family preservation services to avoid the
need for foster care or facilitate the return of foster children to
their families.  When children must be removed from their homes, many
states give preference to placing them in kinship care with relatives
to maintain family ties, and, in some cases, save on costs.  In
addition, some states are considering the use of specialized foster
parents for children with health or other unique needs because these
parents provide more family-like care than institutions, and at the
same time, save costs.  To find permanent homes for foster children
who cannot return to their families, states have also participated in
a federal adoptions assistance program, although significant barriers
to adoption still exist. 


      STATES SEEK TO PRESERVE
      FAMILIES AND MINIMIZE THE
      NEED FOR FOSTER CARE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1

States have acted to strengthen families to lessen the likelihood of
continued abuse and neglect and minimize the need for foster care. 
To prevent the need for foster care, states and localities are
experimenting with providing family preservation services.  Families
with children at risk of abuse or neglect receive a combination of
services over several weeks or months arranged by caseworkers who
generally make frequent home visits and concentrate on helping a few
families.  Services can include training in parenting and
housekeeping, transportation, and mental health and family
counseling. 

Studies show that family preservation services can preclude the need
for foster care at least up to 1 year, although little is known about
long-term results.\26 Because costs for family preservation services
are a fraction of foster care costs, these findings offer some
promise of cost savings.  In 1993, 48 states offered some family
preservation services.  Despite promising early results, resources
are still sufficiently limited so that most states cannot offer
family preservation services to all clients in need of services.\27
However, such services should expand as a result of recent federal
funding earmarked for this purpose.

      STATES INCREASE USE OF
      KINSHIP CARE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.2

When foster care is necessary, states have increasingly placed
children with relatives in what is called kinship care.  The
proportion of foster children placed with relatives grew from 18
percent to 31 percent between 1986 and 1990 in 25 states, including
California and New York.\28

The proportions were even higher in some metropolitan areas, such as
New York City, where about half of foster children were in kinship
care in the early 1990s.  African American children are especially
likely to be placed in kinship care.  About 29 states give preference
to kinship care when appropriate. 

States have increased their use of kinship care for a variety of
reasons:  to maintain children's ties to their families; encourage
long-term placements; meet federal standards of care (see app.  IV);
offset shortages of traditional foster homes; and, in some cases,
save on costs by offering lower payments.  Kinship care is less
costly than traditional foster homes in those states where relatives
are ineligible for state foster care payments.  Although relatives
might be eligible for assistance from AFDC, AFDC levels are
significantly lower than state foster care maintenance payments. 

Kinship care, however, poses several challenges.  First, children's
access to needed services may be more limited because kinship foster
parents are more likely to live in impoverished communities and lack
experience accessing needed services than other foster parents. 
Second, children may be more vulnerable to repeated neglect or abuse
because they are more at risk of unsupervised visits with parents or
other relatives from whose care they were removed.  Third, child
welfare agencies do not always monitor or supervise kinship care
placements as much as traditional foster care placements.  Finally,
children in kinship care tend to stay in foster care longer than
other foster children because, for various reasons, child welfare
agencies are less likely to arrange alternative placements, such as
guardianship or adoption.  In those states where relatives receive
AFDC rather than foster care payments, AFDC costs may offset savings
that might have resulted from lower reimbursement rates when children
remain in kinship care for prolonged periods.

      SPECIALIZED FAMILY FOSTER
      CARE ADDRESSES NEEDS IN LESS
      INSTITUTIONAL SETTING
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.3

Increasingly, states are using specialized foster parents rather than
institutional care to provide more nurturing and family-like care at
reduced costs for children and adolescents with special needs.  These
children include those who are severely emotionally disturbed,
medically complex or fragile, HIV positive, or delinquent. 
Specialized care typically involves therapy or treatment provided in
the foster home. 

To meet the unique needs of foster children they serve, specialized
foster parents are generally carefully selected and trained.  In
addition, they are paid at higher rates, provided more agency support
and supervision, and given access to more comprehensive referral
services than traditional foster parents.  Although generally more
expensive than traditional foster family care, specialized care is
less expensive and considered more nurturing than institutional care
in group homes, residential facilities, or psychiatric institutions. 


      STATES PARTICIPATE IN
      ADOPTION INITIATIVE FOR
      HARD-TO-PLACE FOSTER
      CHILDREN
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.4

States also participate in the federal adoptions assistance program,
which is designed to obtain stable, permanent homes for certain
foster children.  This program encourages the adoption of federally
eligible foster children who cannot return to their biological
families and have special needs that make them difficult to place. 
Title IV-E provides an open-ended individual entitlement that helps
cover one-time adoption expenses and offers monthly payments to
adoptive families of children who might otherwise languish in foster
care because of their age; minority status; disabilities; emotional,
behavioral, or learning problems; or other special needs.  Studies
have indicated that such assistance increases the likelihood of
adoption of older and minority children and is cost effective. 
Regarding costs, a Westat study found that adoption assistance saved
the government $1.6 billion from 1983 to 1987 over what costs would
have been if children had remained in foster care.\29

The success of the adoption assistance program in reducing foster
care caseloads and costs, however, appears to be limited by barriers
to timely adoptions.\30 Many states view federal standards (see app. 
IV) as requiring a sequential approach to the permanent placement of
foster children and therefore plan for family reunification before
considering adoptions.\31 Further, once adoption is planned, delays
often occur in terminating parental rights, a required step before
adoptions can be arranged.  This occurs, in part, because the courts
lack a clear consensus on the proper balance among the needs of
biological parents, adoptive parents, and the child.  Attempts to
ensure racial or ethnic matches between children and adoptive parents
are also believed to add delays.\32

(Rockville, Md.:  1993). 

\30 See also Barriers to Freeing Children for Adoption, HHS, Office
of the Inspector General (Washington, D.C.:  1991). 

\31 Washington state is experimenting with concurrent reunification
and adoption efforts to decrease the time needed to place children
for adoption. 

\32 The Howard M.  Metzenbaum Multi-Ethnic Placement Act of 1994
(P.L.  103-382) bars these practices.  Although the block grant
proposal repeals this act, it substitutes similar language
prohibiting racial or ethnic barriers to adoption. 


   THE CONGRESS CONSIDERING
   CHANGES TO CHILD WELFARE
   PROGRAMS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6

The Congress is currently debating proposals to replace foster care
and other child welfare programs with a block grant.  The Child
Protection Block Grant (CPBG)--title II of H.R.  4--passed by the
House of Representatives on March 24, 1995, would consolidate foster
care and at least 18 related child welfare programs into a single
block grant to states.  (See app.  III.) CPBG would eliminate
restrictions on states' use of various funding sources under the
current programs, place annual limits on funding, and allocate funds
to states on the basis of past rather than current expenditures. 
Federal eligibility criteria and oversight largely would be
eliminated, and standards and planning and reporting requirements
would be streamlined to allow states more flexibility in designing
and administering their programs.\33

Federal, state, and local officials and child welfare experts we
consulted (see app.  I) noted possible benefits of CPBG.  First,
officials agreed that capping the block grant would control federal
foster care expenditures and might result in savings at that level. 
Second, officials generally agreed that CPBG would provide increased
program flexibility so that states could respond more quickly and
creatively to changing caseload needs.  For example, states would be
able to use funds, formerly restricted to foster care, for preventive
and rehabilitative services--a move that some states believe holds
promise for controlling caseload growth.  Further, increased
flexibility resulting from simplified planning, reporting, and
eligibility criteria would streamline administration and could cut
costs.  As a result, states could more easily shift resources to
areas of greater need. 

On the other hand, many experts expressed concern that the block
grant would shift much of the financing burden to the states, which
might be unable to support increased caseloads without reducing
services.\34 They were also concerned that, due to reduced federal
funding and oversight, the quality of foster care could be adversely
affected. 

Our work on block grants suggests that three lessons can be drawn
from the experience with the 1981 block grants\35 that would have
value to the Congress as it considers creating new ones.  First, a
clear need exists to focus on accountability for results to provide
the Congress with information on program performance.  Second,
funding allocations to states should be studied carefully and reflect
need, ability to pay, and variations in the cost of providing
services.  Finally, because the programs in the current proposal are
much larger and essentially different from those programs included in
the 1981 block grants, states are likely to face greater challenges
than they did in the early 1980s. 

In addition to Members of the Congress, we are providing copies of
this report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, state
child welfare directors, and other interested parties.  Should you
have any questions or wish to discuss the information provided,
please call me at (202) 512-7230.  Other GAO contacts and staff

Child Welfare Services (CRS 95-566 EPW), Congressional Research
Service (Washington, D.C.:  May 1995). 

\34 Advocates expect foster care caseloads to grow to accommodate
children ineligible for AFDC under the proposed welfare block grant. 
Growing caseloads, in turn, would shift funds from services to
payments to foster care providers. 

\35 Under the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, the administration
of federal domestic assistance programs was substantially changed by
consolidating more than 50 categorical grant programs into nine block
grants and shifting primary administrative responsibility for these
programs to the states.

RECENT GAO REPORTS AND TESTIMONIES
ON CHILD PROTECTION, FOSTER CARE,
ADOPTION, AND RELATED TOPICS
=========================================================== Appendix V


   CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT
   PREVENTION
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:1


      CHILD ABUSE:  PREVENTION
      PROGRAMS NEED GREATER
      EMPHASIS (GAO/HRD-92-99,
      AUG.  3, 1992)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:1.1

Child abuse prevention programs have been shown to be effective and
may pay for themselves by lowering the social costs resulting from
child abuse.  However, federal child abuse prevention funding appears
relatively low compared with federal expenditures for assistance to
abuse victims.  Prevention programs have difficulty meeting their
funding needs because grants are short term and come from multiple
sources, which increases programs' administrative costs. 


      CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT: 
      PROGRESS OF THE NATIONAL
      CENTER SINCE MAY 1991
      (GAO/T-HRD-92-14, MAR.  6,
      1992)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:1.2

Since May 1991, the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect has
made some progress in monitoring grant programs, managing the
clearinghouse and resource centers on child abuse data, and obtaining
more staff and expertise.  Despite these encouraging signs,
administrative effectiveness may not improve because of the Center's
growing workload.  The Center continues to fall short in providing
timely on-site monitoring, assessing its technical assistance, and
submitting required reports to the Congress.  The Center's limited
resources continue to hinder its goal of providing leadership in
preventing and treating child abuse and neglect. 


      CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT: 
      NCCAN'S IMPLEMENTATION OF
      CAPTA OF 1988
      (GAO/T-HRD-91-29, MAY 9,
      1991)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:1.3

Although the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect addressed the
requirements of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1988
to varying degrees, staff and resource shortages hindered its grant
administration.  Further, the Center's implementation of the act does
not satisfy all of the requirements. 


      CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION: 
      STATUS OF THE CHALLENGE
      GRANT PROGRAM
      (GAO/HRD-91-95, MAY 9, 1991)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:1.4

By fiscal year 1989, 42 states had established child abuse prevention
trust funds with a median trust fund revenue of about $240,000. 
Although more than $94 million in state funds were available for
child abuse prevention activities, only $40 million were considered
for federal matching funds.  The total amount of federal funds spent
on child abuse prevention was unknown. 


   FOSTER CARE
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2


      CHILD WELFARE: 
      OPPORTUNITIES TO FURTHER
      ENHANCE FAMILY PRESERVATION
      AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES
      (GAO/HEHS-95-112, JUNE 15,
      1995)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.1

A crisis in the child welfare system has constrained states' ability
to meet the service needs of our nation's most vulnerable children
and their families.  The family preservation and support provisions
of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 were enacted to help
states provide services designed to preserve families, especially
those at risk of abusing and neglecting their children, and prevent
unnecessary foster care placements.  While activities implementing
the law during its first 18 months appear to be on target,
opportunities exist for HHS to further enhance state efforts to
develop a viable plan and monitor results. 


      FOSTER CARE:  HEALTH NEEDS
      OF MANY YOUNG CHILDREN
      UNKNOWN AND UNMET
      (GAO/HEHS-95-114, MAY 26,
      1995)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.2

Important health-related needs, including routine medical
examinations and various specialized services, remained unmet for
nearly one-third of the young foster children in Los Angeles County,
New York City, and Philadelphia County.  Additionally, most young
foster children in the locations reviewed were at high risk for the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a result of parental drug
abuse.  Yet, foster care agencies have been slow to respond to one
critical health need--HIV risk assessment--which is the first step in
identifying infected children so that they can receive appropriate
and timely health care.  Few children in the locations reviewed were
tested for the virus.  Furthermore, young children in kinship care
were less likely than those placed in traditional foster care to
receive needed health-related services. 


      FOSTER CARE:  PARENTAL DRUG
      ABUSE HAS ALARMING IMPACT ON
      YOUNG CHILDREN
      (GAO/HEHS-94-89, APR.  4,
      1994)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.3

Compared with the 1986 population, the 1991 population of young
foster children in Los Angeles County, New York City, and
Philadelphia County were more likely to have drug-abusing parents and
to be at risk for health problems related to prenatal drug exposure. 
Seventy-eight percent of the foster children in 1991 had at least one
drug- or alcohol-abusing parent, compared with 52 percent in 1986. 
Further, 62 percent of the foster children had a higher risk for
future health-related problems because of prenatal drug exposure
compared with 29 percent in 1986. 


      RESIDENTIAL CARE:  SOME
      HIGH-RISK YOUTH BENEFIT, BUT
      MORE STUDY NEEDED
      (GAO/HEHS-94-56, JAN.  28,
      1994)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.4

Residential care appears to be a viable treatment option for some
high-risk youths.  Residential care programs report benefits in
school attendance and in avoiding drug abuse and criminal activity. 
However, these programs seldom conduct controlled or comparison
studies to determine how outcomes are linked to their treatment
efforts, and few programs have conducted studies to show what
happened to participants more than 12 months after they left the
programs. 


      FOSTER CARE:  FEDERAL POLICY
      ON TITLE IV-E SHARE OF
      TRAINING (GAO/HRD-94-7, NOV. 
      3, 1993)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.5

Federal funds for foster care and foster care training are made
available to the states under title IV-E of the Social Security Act. 
Under current procedures, states allocate foster care training costs
between the IV-E foster care program and other programs so that each
program is charged its proportionate share of training costs on the
basis of benefits received.  Some state officials oppose the current
HHS cost-sharing policy because it limits IV-E reimbursement and the
amount of foster care training they can provide. 


      FOSTER CARE:  SERVICES TO
      PREVENT OUT-OF-HOME
      PLACEMENTS ARE LIMITED BY
      FUNDING BARRIERS
      (GAO/HRD-93-76, JUNE 29,
      1993)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.6

The existing federal system for financing child welfare programs
offers little incentive for states to provide services designed to
keep families together and avert the need for foster care; instead,
states find it easier to house a growing population in federally
subsidized foster care.  Various funding barriers limit states'
ability to provide welfare services.  Federal funding for foster care
is open ended, but funding for direct child welfare services is
limited.  Further, state fiscal crises have limited funding for
preventing foster care placements and family reunification services. 


      FOSTER CARE:  STATE AGENCIES
      OTHER THAN CHILD WELFARE CAN
      ACCESS TITLE IV-E FUNDS
      (GAO/HRD-93-6, FEB.  9,
      1993)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.7

HHS has issued several policy statements clarifying eligibility
requirements for reimbursement for foster care placements.  The
Department has reimbursed states for placements made by juvenile
justice agencies since 1984.  Of the states that responded to a 1991
survey, 21 claimed reimbursement for placements by juvenile justice
agencies, and 13 claimed reimbursement for placements by mental
health agencies. 


      FOSTER CARE:  CHILDREN'S
      EXPERIENCES LINKED TO
      VARIOUS FACTORS; BETTER DATA
      NEEDED (GAO/HRD-91-64, SEPT. 
      11, 1991)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.8

We analyze data on length of stay in foster care and reentry for
children who entered or left foster care in six states and two
localities.  Of children reunited with their families in 1986, up to
27 percent subsequently reentered foster care.  The median length of
stay for children entering or leaving care in 1986 in the states and
localities reviewed varied from 8 to 19 months.  Children whose
initial stay in foster care was under a year, however, were more
likely to reenter foster care than those whose initial stays were
longer.  Moreover, children placed in institutions in the states
reviewed generally stayed in foster care longer than those placed in
foster family homes. 


      CHILD WELFARE:  MONITORING
      OUT-OF-STATE PLACEMENTS
      (GAO/HRD-91-107BR, SEPT.  3,
      1991)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2.9

Our review of 42 children from 15 states showed that placement
agencies complied with federal law regarding the frequency of case
reviews.  Despite budgetary constraints, most placement agencies
visit the children to assess the children's well-being and progress
in the treatment program. 


      RESPITE CARE:  AN OVERVIEW
      OF FEDERAL, SELECTED STATE,
      AND PRIVATE PROGRAMS
      (GAO/HRD-90-125, SEPT.  6,
      1990)
------------------------------------------------------ Appendix V:2.10

Respite care provides temporary child care relief to family members
and other caretakers of disabled children to prevent child abuse and
neglect and support family unity.  Respite care services are funded
through state and local agencies, national organizations, and federal
departments.  Funding patterns differ among states.  The demand for
respite care services exceeds the available supply. 


      FOSTER PARENTS:  RECRUITING
      AND PRESERVICE TRAINING
      PRACTICES NEED EVALUATION
      (GAO/HRD-89-86, AUG.  3,
      1989)
------------------------------------------------------ Appendix V:2.11

The most effective recruiting strategies realistically portrayed
foster care difficulties, emphasized foster care's temporary nature,
and defined the positive role of foster parents.  Effective
preservice training focused on enabling foster parents to make
informed decisions about foster children's needs, enabling social
service agencies to assess foster parents' suitability for caring for
foster children, and facilitated teamwork between social service
agencies and foster parents.  States have performed limited formal
evaluations of their recruiting and preservice training practices,
and few have comprehensively evaluated the effectiveness of various
demonstration activities. 


   OTHER
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3


      ADOPTION:  ASSISTANCE
      PROVIDED BY SELECTED
      EMPLOYERS TO ADOPTING
      PARENTS (GAO/HRD-90-47FS,
      DEC.  19, 1989)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.1

Fifty-six of 77 employers in our review financially assisted
employees adopting children and commonly imposed a dollar limit on
the amount of assistance.  All 77 employers allowed adopting parents
to use some form of unpaid or paid leave, but few employers provided
adoption or parental leave benefits. 


      CHILD WELFARE:  HHS BEGINS
      TO ASSUME LEADERSHIP TO
      IMPLEMENT NATIONAL AND STATE
      SYSTEMS (GAO/AIMD-94-37,
      JUNE 8, 1994)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.2

HHS' initiatives to address information system implementation
problems include issuing final regulations and functional system
requirements, working with the states to develop a draft system model
for other states to follow in developing their systems, and hiring a
contractor to help states develop their systems. 


      FAMILIES ON WELFARE:  SHARP
      RISE IN NEVER-MARRIED WOMEN
      REFLECTS SOCIETAL TREND
      (GAO/HEHS-94-92, MAY 31,
      1994)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.3

From 1976 to 1992, the proportion of single women receiving Aid to
Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) who had never been married
more than doubled, increasing from about 21 percent to about 52
percent.  This change paralleled a broader societal trend among all
single mothers.  Single women receiving AFDC in 1992 were better
educated, had fewer children, and worked as much as their
counterparts in 1976, but were twice as likely to have incomes below
the poverty level. 


      FAMILIES ON WELFARE: 
      TEENAGE MOTHERS LEAST LIKELY
      TO BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT
      (GAO/HEHS-94-115, MAY 31,
      1994)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.4

Women who gave birth as teenagers make up nearly half of the AFDC
caseload--a sizeable group.  Women who had their first child when
they were teenagers may have the most difficulty earning their way
off welfare and becoming self-sufficient. 


      INTEGRATING HUMAN SERVICES: 
      LINKING AT-RISK FAMILIES
      WITH SERVICES MORE
      SUCCESSFUL THAN SYSTEM
      REFORM EFFORTS
      (GAO/HRD-92-108, SEPT.  24,
      1992)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.5

Broad-based and ambitious system-oriented efforts have faced many
obstacles and met with limited success.  For example, programs and
initiatives we visited were unable to create new organizational
structures or develop multiagency service plans and budgets.  In
contrast, service-oriented efforts were able to link at-risk families
to human services and provide a combination of health and other
supportive services. 


      ADMS BLOCK GRANT:  WOMEN'S
      SET-ASIDE DOES NOT ASSURE
      DRUG TREATMENT FOR PREGNANT
      WOMEN (GAO/HRD-91-80, MAY 6,
      1991)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.6

The Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services women's set-aside
increased almost 500 percent between fiscal years 1988 and 1990. 
Despite that increase, the Congress lacked adequate information to
determine whether the set-aside effectively reduced treatment
barriers and addressed treatment needs since HHS did not clearly
specify reporting requirements to states.  The women's set-aside did
not ensure that states provided appropriate treatment services to
women since the set-aside encouraged, but did not require, states to
fund specifically designed treatment. 


      DRUG ABUSE:  THE CRACK
      COCAINE EPIDEMIC--HEALTH
      CONSEQUENCES AND TREATMENT
      (GAO/HRD-91-55FS, JAN.  30,
      1991)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.7

Cocaine abusers had high rates of such mental disorders as
depression, schizophrenia, and antisocial personality disorder. 
Health professionals associated crack use with the spread of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome and other sexually transmitted diseases. 
No state-of-the-art treatment method for crack abusers existed. 


      DRUG-EXPOSED INFANTS:  A
      GENERATION AT RISK
      (GAO/HRD-90-138, JUNE 28,
      1990)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.8

Estimates of the number of infants exposed to cocaine annually ranged
from 100,000 to 375,000.  Drug-exposed infants were more likely than
unexposed infants to suffer from medical problems and, in some cases,
required costly medical care.  Twelve hundred of the 4,000
drug-exposed infants at 10 hospitals were placed in foster care, and
the cost of 1 year of foster care for those infants was about $7.2
million. 


      CHILDREN'S ISSUES:  A DECADE
      OF GAO REPORTS AND RECENT
      ACTIVITIES (GAO/HRD-90-162,
      SEPT.  21, 1990)
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3.9

Pursuant to a congressional request, we provided an annotated
bibliography of our studies on children's issues.  We provided (1) an
annotated bibliography of 58 reports and testimonies published
between October 1988 and March 1990; (2) titles of reports issued
between fiscal years 1980 and 1988; (3) information on current
assignments relating to children and families, as of March 31, 1990;
and (4) information on other publications by our staff on
child-related issues.

<h1>Prescription Drugs and the Elderly: Many Still Receive
Potentially Harmful Drugs Despite Recent Improvements </h1>

<pre>
<font size="2">(Letter Report, 07/24/95, GAO/HEHS-95-152).
<img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">

Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO examined the elderly's
inappropriate use of prescription drugs, focusing on: (1) whether the
inappropriate use of prescription drugs by the elderly is widely viewed
as a serious health problem; (2) the ways prescription drugs are used
inappropriately and why these situations occur; (3) how public knowledge
of prescription drugs can be improved; and (4) how emerging trends in
health care delivery affect drug prescribing for the elderly.

GAO found that: (1) the inappropriate prescription drug use is a serious
health risk for the elderly, since they take more prescription drugs
than other age groups, they often take several drugs at once, resulting
in adverse drug reactions, and they do not efficiently eliminate drugs
from their systems due to decreased body function; (2) the percentage of
Medicare recipients over 65 using unsuitable prescription drugs dropped
from 25 percent in 1987 to 17.5 percent in 1992; (3) inappropriate
prescription drug use results from physicians using outdated prescribing
practices, pharmacists not performing drug utilization reviews, and
patients not informing their physician and pharmacist of all the drugs
they are taking; (4) to address the problem of inappropriate
prescription drug use, the government is working to disseminate
information on the effect of prescription drugs on the elderly, the
medical community is working to increase physicians' knowledge of
geriatrics, and patients are increasingly seeking information about
their drug therapies; and (5) enrollment in managed care plans has grown
rapidly, particularly among senior citizens, allowing for the potential
to improve the coordination of drug therapies for newly enrolled elderly
patients.

July 24, 1995

The Honorable Ron Wyden
House of Representatives

Dear Mr.  Wyden: 

A recent study concluded that, in 1987, nearly one of four
noninstitutionalized elderly patients were taking prescription drugs
that many experts regard as generally unsuitable for their age group
because alternative drugs provide the same therapeutic benefit with
fewer side effects.\1 According to gerontology experts, the
percentage of elderly patients affected by the inappropriate use of
prescription drugs would be even greater if other situations, such as
potentially dangerous drug interactions or incorrect dosages, were
taken into account.  The inappropriate use of prescription drugs may
cause unnecessary adverse drug reactions that may lead to subtle
deterioration of function or precipitate medical crises resulting in
hospitalization or death.  They also contribute to higher medical
costs borne in part by either Medicare or Medicaid.  The Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that the annual cost of
hospitalizations due to inappropriate prescription drug use is $20
billion. 

Concerned that the inappropriate use of prescription drugs harms the
health and quality of life of the elderly, you asked us to

  determine if the inappropriate use of prescription drugs among the
     elderly is widely viewed as a serious health problem;

  identify the ways prescription drugs are inappropriately used and
     why these situations occur;

  identify how physicians, pharmacists, and patients receive
     information on prescription drugs and how their knowledge of
     prescription drugs and drug therapies could be improved; and

  provide information on how emerging trends in health care delivery
     affect drug prescribing for the elderly. 

To address these issues, we conducted a literature review and
obtained documents from leading researchers in the fields of
gerontology and elderly clinical pharmacology.  We interviewed these
individuals as well as representatives of FDA, the Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA), state Medicaid programs, industry
trade associations, senior citizen and consumer advocacy groups, and
medical associations who are knowledgeable in the use of prescription
drugs for the elderly.  We analyzed data on prescription drug use
from HCFA's 1992 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey.\2 We conducted
our study from October 1994 to May 1995 in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards.  (See app.  I for details on
our scope and methodology.)

   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

The inappropriate use of prescription drugs is a potential health
problem that is particularly acute for the elderly.  Not only do the
elderly use more prescription drugs than any other age group, they
are more likely to be taking several drugs at once, increasing the
probability of adverse drug reactions.  Furthermore, the elderly do
not eliminate drugs from their systems as efficiently as younger
patients because of decreased liver and kidney function. 

Our analysis of 1992 data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary
Survey found that about 17.5 percent of almost 30 million
noninstitutionalized Medicare recipients 65 or older used at least
one drug identified as generally unsuitable for elderly patients
since safer alternative drugs exist.  While still significant, this
is an improvement over the almost 25 percent reported for 1987 data. 

Inappropriate prescription drug use can result from the behavior not
only of the physician but also of the pharmacist and patient.  Such
behavior includes physicians using outdated prescribing practices,
particularly for elderly patients; pharmacists not performing drug
utilization reviews; and patients not informing their physician and
pharmacist about all the drugs they are taking.  Any of these factors
can increase the likelihood that an elderly person will use a drug
that may impair his or her health. 

Although the experts we interviewed agreed that the inappropriate use
of prescription drugs remains a significant health problem, they
identified several recent efforts that are helping to address this
problem.  Federal and state initiatives have encouraged the
development and dissemination of detailed information on the effect
of prescription drugs on the elderly.  At the same time, the medical
community has begun to emphasize the need to increase physicians'
knowledge of geriatrics and elderly clinical pharmacology.  The
development of drug utilization review systems now permits
prescriptions to be screened before they are filled to identify
potential problems, such as adverse drug interactions or
inappropriate dosage levels.  Finally, patients increasingly have
been seeking information about their drug therapies from several
sources, including consumer advocacy groups, state agencies, and
pharmaceutical companies. 

Changes in the health care delivery system also have the potential to
reduce the inappropriate use of prescription drugs.  Managed care
plans, whose enrollment has grown from 10 million in 1980 to almost
90 million in 1992, are now actively enrolling senior citizens. 
Through utilization controls such as a &quot;gatekeeper,&quot; managed care
plans have the potential to improve the coordination of drug
therapies for newly enrolled elderly patients.  Furthermore, a
growing number of employers and health plans now use pharmacy benefit
management firms to administer their prescription drug benefit
programs.  From 1989 to 1993, the number of individuals covered by
pharmacy benefit management firms increased from fewer than 60
million to 100 million.  Through increased oversight and review,
these firms have the potential to further reduce inappropriate
prescription drug use. 


   INAPPROPRIATE USE OF
   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS A MAJOR
   HEALTH PROBLEM FOR THE ELDERLY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

The inappropriate use of prescription drugs is a problem that is
particularly acute for the elderly.  The elderly use more
prescription drugs than any other age group and are more likely to be
taking multiple prescription drugs, which increases the probability
of adverse drug reactions.  Furthermore, the elderly are more
susceptible to adverse drug reactions because of the aging process. 
As a result, many experts believe that some drugs are generally
inappropriate for the elderly because equally effective and safer
alternative drugs exist.  Additionally, other drugs though
appropriate should be used at reduced dosage levels to accommodate
elderly physiology. 


      INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIPTION
      DRUG USE IS WIDESPREAD AMONG
      THE ELDERLY
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1

Based on 1987 data from the National Medical Expenditure Survey, a
research study published in July 1994 concluded that almost 25
percent of the noninstitutionalized elderly 65 or older used
prescription drugs at least once during the year that are generally
considered unsuitable for their age group.\3 The study used a list of
20 drugs, based on criteria published in 1991, that generally should
not be used by elderly patients.\4

A second study published in October 1994 reinforced the findings of
the earlier study.\5 In this study, the researchers interviewed a
sample of community residents, 75 or older living in Santa Monica,
California, during 1989 and 1990 about their use of prescription
drugs, over-the-counter medications, and home remedies within the 4
weeks prior to the interview.  The researchers used primarily the
same criteria as the July 1994 study, but only looked at drug usage
over a 1-month period rather than the entire year.  This study
concluded that 14 percent of those interviewed used at least one of
the drugs generally identified as not suitable for elderly patients. 

Several experts we interviewed expressed reservations about the
appropriateness of using 1991 criteria to evaluate prescription drug
use in years before the criteria were developed.  However, these
experts did not disagree with the criteria themselves.  To determine
if there was much change in prescribing patterns after 1991, we
analyzed data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey conducted
by HCFA's Office of the Actuary to see what percentage of
noninstitutionalized Medicare beneficiaries in 1992 used any of the
20 drugs.\6 Our analysis showed that an estimated 17.5 percent of the
almost 30 million senior citizens in the survey used at least one of
these drugs in 1992.\7 Although this represented an improvement over
the 1987 data, more than one out of six elderly patients were still
using prescription drugs generally considered unsuitable for their
age group. 

Many health care practitioners questioned whether the use of these
drugs should always be characterized as inappropriate.  They
maintained that, under certain circumstances, their use would be
perfectly acceptable.  For example, if a patient was already using a
particular drug and doing well, there would be little medical
justification for switching to another drug.  Still, none of these
practitioners said that this rationale would account for the high
percentage of elderly patients using drugs deemed inappropriate.  All
the experts we interviewed agreed that the inappropriate use of
prescription drugs continues to be a significant health problem. 

Several experts also pointed out that these research studies only
looked at one type of the inappropriate use of prescription drugs. 
In their opinion, when other examples are considered such as
potentially dangerous drug interactions or incorrect dosages, the
percentage of senior citizens affected by the inappropriate use of
prescription drugs would be even greater than the estimates provided
in those studies.

      THE ELDERLY ARE PARTICULARLY
      VULNERABLE TO INAPPROPRIATE
      PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.2

The elderly are more likely than other segments of the population to
be affected by the inappropriate use of prescription drugs.  As a
group, the elderly are more likely to suffer from more than one
disease or chronic condition concurrently, which means that they may
take several different drugs at one time.  As the number of
prescriptions increases, so does the potential for adverse drug
reactions caused by drug interactions or drug-disease
contraindications.  The physiological changes of aging are a major
reason drugs have the potential to cause problems in the elderly. 
Elderly patients often lack the ability to eliminate drugs from their
systems as efficiently as younger patients do because of decreased
liver and kidney function.  In addition, they are more sensitive to
the effects of drugs.  Thus, they are not able to accommodate the
normal adult dosage. 

The inappropriate use of prescription drugs is a major cause of
adverse drug reactions that, if severe enough, can result in
hospitalization or death.  Since the elderly are more vulnerable to
the effects of the inappropriate prescription drug use, they are at
greater risk from adverse drug reactions than other segments of the
population.  Studies indicate that about 3 percent of all hospital
admissions are caused by adverse drug reactions.\8

However, the percentage is much higher for the elderly.  One study
estimated the percentage of hospitalizations of elderly patients due
to adverse drug reactions to be 17 percent, almost 6 times greater
than for the general population.\9 Applying an average unit cost to
the proportion of hospital admissions that are drug-related, FDA
estimates that hospitalizations due to inappropriate prescription
drug use cost about $20 billion annually. 

Less severe adverse drug reactions may go unnoticed or be discounted
by both health practitioners and the elderly as the normal effects of
the aging process.  However, these side effects, such as drowsiness,
loss of coordination, and confusion, can result in falls or car
accidents.  A study estimated that 32,000 senior citizens annually
suffer hip fractures as a result of falls caused by adverse drug
reactions.\10 Another study concluded that about 16,000 car accidents
resulting in injuries each year can be attributed to adverse drug
reactions experienced by elderly drivers.\11 Even if no serious
bodily injury occurs, adverse drug reactions decrease the general
quality of life for patients because of drug-induced mental
impairment, loss of coordination, or addiction.

   MANY FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO THE
   INAPPROPRIATE USE OF
   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

The factors leading to the inappropriate use of prescription drugs
are multifaceted and interconnected, according to experts we
interviewed.  These factors reflect the behavior of the physician,
pharmacist, and patient, either collectively or individually.  From
the time a drug is prescribed to the point where the drug is taken,
many possible events, often interconnected with each other, can lead
to an adverse drug reaction or other serious results. 

The inappropriate use of prescription drugs can take several
different forms, ranging from potentially life- threatening drug-drug
interactions to therapeutic duplication (using two or more similar
drugs to treat the same problem), which yields little benefit at
increased cost.  Other examples of the inappropriate use of
prescription drugs include

  drug-age contraindication,

  drug-allergy contraindication,

  drug-disease contraindication,

  incorrect drug dosage,

  incorrect duration of drug therapy, and

  less effective drug therapy.\12

A physician, a pharmacist, or a patient may take or omit actions that
can produce an adverse drug reaction.  For example, a drug-drug
interaction could be due to a physician not recognizing that a
prescribed drug interacts badly with another prescribed medication or
over-the-counter drug used by the patient.  (See fig.  1.) The
pharmacist may contribute to the situation by not detecting the
negative interaction or by failing to determine which drugs the
elderly patient is taking.  The elderly patient may not give the
doctor and pharmacist a complete list of all the medications,
including over-the-counter drugs, that he or she is taking.  Thus,
all three parties may contribute to a drug-drug interaction, with
potentially serious consequences to the patient. 

   Figure 1:  Possible Causes and
   Outcomes of Adverse Drug
   Reactions

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Health care professionals noted that the overuse and underuse of drug
therapies may also contribute to the inappropriate use of
prescription drugs.\13 Drug overuse occurs when a medication is
prescribed but either no medication was needed or an alternative
treatment approach existed.  For example, changes in diet and
lifestyle may be more appropriate than drug therapy.  More
controversial is the selection of drug therapy over counseling to
treat psychological conditions such as anxiety or depression.  Drug
underuse occurs when an appropriate medication either is not
prescribed or is underprescribed.  For example, one study reported
that patients with advanced cancer were at risk of receiving less
than adequate pain medication.\14

   BETTER INFORMATION AND
   COMMUNICATION CAN HELP PREVENT
   INAPPROPRIATE DRUG USE
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

According to several experts we interviewed, lowering the elderly's
risk of adverse drug reactions requires that more detailed
information on the impact of drug therapies on the elderly be
developed and disseminated to health practitioners.  Furthermore,
many health practitioners agreed that physicians, pharmacists, and
patients should all participate in the drug therapy decision-making
process.  Increased communication between and among physicians,
pharmacists, and patients is vital to ensuring that this process is
effective. 


      FDA HAS IMPROVED DRUG
      GUIDELINES FOR THE ELDERLY
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1

One difficulty in prescribing drugs for the elderly has been the lack
of specific information on dosage levels established for the elderly
through clinical tests.  Recognizing the need for additional
information on the effects of drugs on the elderly, FDA issued
voluntary guidelines in 1989 governing the testing of new drugs
intended for elderly patients.  These guidelines call for the
inclusion of elderly patients during the drug's testing process.  The
intent of these guidelines is to develop better information for both
physicians and pharmacists on dosage standards for new drugs intended
for elderly patients as well as to identify side effects that are
more pronounced in the elderly than in the general population.  FDA's
Director of Drug Policy and Evaluation stated that he believed that
pharmaceutical manufacturers have complied with these guidelines. 
However, several experts said that clinical trials performed under
these guidelines are not representative of the elderly population as
a whole.  For example, they believe that elderly patients over 75 are
underrepresented.\15

      BETTER PHYSICIAN EDUCATION
      CAN IMPROVE POOR PRESCRIBING
      PRACTICES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.2

The medical community has only recently started to emphasize the
study of geriatrics and elderly clinical pharmacology.  For example,
board certification in geriatrics was offered for the first time in
1988.  Recognizing the aging of the population, most medical schools
now offer courses in geriatrics, though only 12 schools require
courses devoted solely to geriatrics.  Experts we interviewed agreed
that medical schools could improve how they train doctors in
geriatrics.  Moreover, several experts stressed the need to improve
the quality of continuing education in geriatrics, because a large
portion of the education doctors receive in medical school becomes
outdated during their careers.  Since medical schools have only
recently introduced geriatric training in their curricula, many
doctors in practice today have had little formal training in that
area.  Two experts also pointed out a similar need for an emphasis on
geriatrics in the training of pharmacists, both in pharmacy school
and through continuing education. 

While preclinical training in pharmacology is routinely provided in
medical school, several experts said that improvements are needed in
the teaching of clinical pharmacology, which trains doctors in the
use of drug therapies to treat disease.  Doctors obtain their
clinical pharmacology training during their residencies.  Physicians'
clinical knowledge of the unique aspects of elderly pharmacology
depends on their exposure to elderly patients.  Several experts
believe that the real expertise in pharmacology rests with the
pharmacists and that doctors need to use this expertise in deciding
the most appropriate drug therapy to prescribe. 


      DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW
      PROGRAMS OFFER SAFEGUARDS
      AGAINST INAPPROPRIATE USE OF
      PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.3

One strategy that is increasingly used to identify and minimize the
inappropriate use of prescription drugs involves drug utilization
reviews.  Drug utilization reviews are intended to screen drug
therapies for potential problems, such as drug-drug interactions,
drug-disease contraindications, incorrect dosages, or improper
duration of treatment.  These reviews can be done either
prospectively or retrospectively.  Prospective drug utilization
reviews are designed to detect potential problems before a
prescription is filled by the pharmacist.  Retrospective drug
utilization reviews occur after the prescription is filled and are
intended to detect prescribing patterns that indicate inappropriate
or unnecessary medical treatment as well as fraud or abuse.  The
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 requires all states to
conduct ongoing retrospective reviews of Medicaid prescription drug
claims and prospective reviews before each prescription is filled. 
Most states have expanded that requirement to mandate drug
utilization review of all prescriptions.  While several experts
acknowledged the potential benefits of drug utilization review
systems, two experts cautioned that these benefits have not been
thoroughly documented to date. 

A prospective drug utilization review system allows point-of-sale
vendors such as pharmacies to check a prescription and a patient's
history against a central database.  This database can alert a
pharmacist to possible drug-drug interactions or a drug-disease
contraindication.  Our study of prospective Medicaid drug utilization
review systems in five states during fiscal year 1993 found that
pharmacies' use of automated drug utilization review systems linked
to statewide Medicaid databases provided a more thorough prospective
review than a manual or localized system.\16

This type of automated review can reduce the risk of inappropriate
drug therapy and increase patient safety, though we recognized the
need for these benefits to be demonstrated conclusively and
recommended that HCFA take steps to do so.  We also recommended that
HCFA develop guidance for the development of these systems to ensure
standard implementation of effective drug utilization review systems. 

New York State's Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage program
provides prescription drug insurance coverage for low-income senior
citizens not eligible for Medicaid.  This program uses a
retrospective drug utilization review system for its therapeutic drug
monitoring program.  This review system monitors each client's
prescriptions, using data from prescription claims submitted for
payment by pharmacies, to detect potential problems such as
overutilization of a drug or a drug-drug interaction.  Once a
potential problem is detected, a program official notifies the
prescribing physician.  The alert is informational only and provides
the doctor with a history of the patient's prescription drug usage,
the suspected problem, its effect and severity, and recommendations
for resolving the problem.  No action is required, but the doctor is
asked to respond.  In one analysis conducted by program staff, 38.4
percent of the patients whose doctors received letters alerting them
to a potential problem subsequently had their drug therapy changed. 

The Massachusetts Medicaid program also uses its retrospective drug
utilization review system to detect questionable prescribing
practices affecting any of its recipients.  For example, if a patient
is prescribed a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used to
relieve the symptoms of arthritis, the system will monitor that
patient for potential side effects of this type of medication, such
as stomach or intestinal bleeding.  If the patient later begins to
take antiulcer medications, the system will issue an alert to the
prescribing doctor that the usage of the first drug may be the cause
of the ulcers.  This allows the doctor to evaluate the situation and,
if warranted, alter the patient's drug therapy. 

A retrospective drug utilization review system can also monitor
patient compliance with a prescribed drug therapy.  For example, a
patient may discontinue his or her blood pressure medication when the
symptoms disappear.  Despite the lack of symptoms, the causes remain,
leaving the patient still at risk.  A retrospective drug utilization
review can detect the patient's failure to refill a prescription and
alert the patient's doctor to the situation for further action.

      IMPROVED PATIENT COUNSELING
      CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF
      ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.4

One way to lower the potential of adverse drug reactions is to ensure
that patients are counseled by either their doctor or pharmacist on
the usage and characteristics of a prescription drug.  Often, subtle
side effects of drugs are ignored by patients and not reported back
to the doctor or pharmacist.  Unless alerted that the patient is
experiencing side effects, a doctor would not be likely to change
drug therapies.  Counseling not only improves the information
received by the patient but also that obtained from the patient. 
This improved communication between doctor or pharmacist and the
patient may prompt a question that leads to the discovery of a
drug-drug interaction or drug-allergy interaction. 

Although effective counseling by doctors and pharmacists can help
reduce the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction, two studies have
found that many patients do not receive this counseling.  A Consumer
Reports study of 70,000 people published in 1995 found that about 26
percent had not been counseled by a physician about their drug
therapies.\17 A 1989 study by the American Association of Retired
Persons (AARP) found that more than one out of three patients
reported that they were not counseled by their doctors on their drug
therapies.\18 Time pressures on both doctors and pharmacists may also
be an obstacle to effective counseling. 

Recognizing the importance of counseling, the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated that pharmacists counsel Medicaid
patients when they receive prescription drugs.  A majority of states
have expanded this requirement to include all patients.  Officials of
the American Pharmaceutical Association and the American Society of
Consultant Pharmacists, two professional associations that represent
pharmacists, stressed the importance of counseling but noted that the
current system of compensation for pharmacists is based on dispensing
drugs and lacks meaningful incentives for counseling.  For example, a
pharmacist may detect a potential problem with a prescription and,
after consultation with the doctor and patient, cancel the
prescription.  If another drug is not substituted and no drug is
dispensed, the pharmacist receives no reimbursement for the
professional services rendered.

      PATIENTS CAN PROTECT
      THEMSELVES FROM ADVERSE DRUG
      REACTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.5

Patients who seek information about their drug therapies can reduce
their likelihood of experiencing adverse drug reactions.  Besides
requesting counseling from both the doctor and pharmacist, public
advocacy groups urge individuals to develop their own knowledge of
drugs.  To achieve this objective, AARP encourages the development of
package product inserts in large type that are easy for the elderly
to read and understand.  Public Citizen Health Research Group, a
public advocacy group, has also published a consumer guidebook for
prescription drugs.  Moreover, pharmaceutical manufacturers have
begun to make information available directly to consumers.  Increased
understanding of their drugs, dosage requirements, and possible side
effects makes patients more likely to avoid the inappropriate use of
drugs. 

State and local agencies have developed several initiatives to alert
consumers to the dangers of inappropriately using prescription drugs. 
For example, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health sponsors
brown bag seminars at senior citizen or community centers.  At these
seminars, elderly patients are encouraged to bring in all their
medicines for review by pharmacists.  The goal is to inventory all
the medications a senior citizen has and eliminate those that are for
conditions no longer being treated or which have expired.  The
remaining drugs are cataloged in what is called a &quot;medicine passport&quot;
that can be shown to doctors and pharmacists as new or additional
drugs are prescribed.  This record allows health practitioners to
quickly review what other medications the person is taking and why. 


   MANAGED CARE HAS THE POTENTIAL
   TO REDUCE THE INAPPROPRIATE USE
   OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

Recent changes in the health care delivery system have implications
for the use of prescription drugs.  The growing emphasis on
controlling health care costs creates a strong incentive to reduce
the inappropriate use of prescription drugs and the physical and
financial costs associated with adverse drug reactions.  Likewise,
the increasing importance of cost containment has helped spur the
emergence of managed care as a major form of health care delivery. 
The number of people covered by managed care plans has increased
dramatically from 10 million in 1980 to almost 90 million in 1992. 
Moreover, many managed care plans have recently initiated major
marketing efforts to enroll elderly patients.  Similarly, the number
of people whose prescriptions are filled by pharmacy benefit
management companies has also increased.  While it is too early to
understand the full impact these changes may have on reducing
inappropriate drug use--in general, and among the elderly in
particular--several experts we interviewed stated that these changes
have the potential to improve the coordination of care and to
increase the ability to detect inappropriate use of drugs.  However,
one expert cautioned that the achievement of these goals might be
adversely affected by pressures to contain costs or increase profits. 


      IMPROVED COORDINATION OF
      CARE IS A GOAL OF MANAGED
      CARE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1

Many elderly patients are under the care of several specialists as
well as their primary care physician.  At times, these doctors may
prescribe several drugs to treat various ailments.  Unless these
various drug therapies are coordinated, adverse drug reactions pose a
serious risk.  Experts in gerontology and elderly clinical
pharmacology that we spoke to stated that the most effective way to
deal with the inappropriate use of prescription drugs was to improve
the coordination of care.  Ideally, this role should fall to the
patient's primary physician. 

Proponents of managed care have stressed improved coordination of
care as a major goal.  Though there are several variations of managed
care such as health maintenance organizations (HMO) or preferred
provider organizations, a basic characteristic of managed care is
control over utilization.  Often, this is done through a gatekeeper. 
A gatekeeper is usually the patient's designated primary doctor who
oversees the individual's care, referring the patient to specialists
as needed.  This allows one doctor to coordinate various treatments,
including drug regimens.  Several experts agreed that such
coordination could help lower the risk of adverse drug reactions
posed by inappropriate drug therapy or a patient receiving multiple
prescriptions from different doctors.  However, they cautioned that
the improved coordination of care is dependent on the quality of
patient care, which varies widely among managed care plans. 

Managed care plans also have the potential to use formularies to
reduce the inappropriate use of prescription drugs.  A formulary
lists the preferred drugs used to treat certain diseases or
conditions.  Typically, the formulary is developed by a committee of
doctors and pharmacists associated with the managed care plan, who
seek to identify the most effective drug therapies at the lowest cost
to the plan.  For example, if two drug therapies are deemed equally
effective, then the plan will recommend the less costly of the two as
the preferred treatment.  However, several experts expressed the
concern that cost concerns rather than effectiveness may be the
primary driving force in selecting which drugs to place on a managed
care plan's formulary. 

A managed care plan can change its formulary to reflect new drug
therapies.  This has an impact on the prescribing behavior of a
plan's doctors who may have to seek an exception if they wish to
prescribe a drug not designated by the plan's formulary.  However,
two experts said that few managed care plans have used their
formularies to improve prescribing practices for elderly patients
though the experts acknowledged this potential exists. 

Another potential advantage of managed care is the data collected on
patients.  This gives managed care plans the information needed to
monitor both the drug therapies patients receive and the prescribing
patterns of physicians.  One HMO we visited provided its doctors with
periodic analyses of their drug-prescribing habits as compared with
standards developed by the HMO.  This comparison allows the HMO to
identify doctors who may need additional training or counseling in
prescribing drugs for their patients, particularly the elderly.

---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.2

Over the past few years, the number of people who receive their
prescription drugs through pharmacy benefit management firms has
increased dramatically from fewer than 60 million in 1989 to 100
million in 1993.  Pharmacy benefit management firms manage
prescription drug benefits on behalf of health plan sponsors,
including self-insured employers, insurance companies, and managed
care plans. 

The initial attraction of pharmacy benefit management firms is their
ability to reduce administrative costs and obtain discounts on
prescriptions drugs through volume buying.  However, these firms can
also provide formulary management and drug utilization review
services with the potential to reduce inappropriate drug use.  For
example, the drug utilization review done by one pharmacy benefit
management firm, PCS Health Systems, generated almost 25 million
alerts in 1994.  Of these alerts, 25 percent dealt with drug-age
contraindications and excessive daily dosages, two types of
inappropriate drug use prevalent among the elderly.  Likewise, by
monitoring patient prescription drug use, pharmacy benefit management
firms can detect a patient's failure to refill a prescription for a
persistent medical condition such as high blood pressure.  The firm
can then alert the patient's doctor to this situation for further
action if required. 

Pharmacy benefit management firms can also develop initiatives to
address the inappropriate use of drugs among the elderly.  For
example, Medco has instituted an educational program called &quot;Partners
for Healthy Aging.&quot; This program provides specialized information to
doctors, pharmacists, and patients to alert them to potential
concerns in the use of prescription drugs among the elderly. 

As the number of patients served by these firms has increased so has
the information gathered on patients.  With the accumulation of data
on patient characteristics, medical conditions, and drug therapies,
pharmacy benefit management firms are developing the necessary
database for engaging in outcomes research.  Such research allows
companies to demonstrate the effectiveness of different courses of
treatment for a disease from both a therapeutic and cost perspective. 
This would permit doctors, patients, and payers to make both
financially and clinically informed health care decisions.

SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
=========================================================== Appendix I

To determine the significance of the inappropriate use of
prescription drugs among the elderly, we conducted a literature
review and obtained documents and testimonial evidence from leading
researchers in the fields of gerontology and elderly clinical
pharmacology.  Additionally, we interviewed other knowledgeable
professionals concerning the issues related to the use of
prescription drugs by the elderly.  Included among these
professionals were representatives of FDA, HCFA, senior citizen and
consumer advocacy groups, the American Pharmaceutical Association,
the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the
American Medical Association, the American Society of Consultant
Pharmacists, and the American Association of Medical Colleges. 

We interviewed state officials in Massachusetts, New York, and
Vermont to see how state and federal health programs deal with the
inappropriate use of prescription drugs among the elderly. 
Massachusetts was selected because of the number of prominent
researchers in the areas of elderly clinical pharmacology located
there.  New York was selected because the state administers the
Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage program, which provides
prescription drug coverage to low-income senior citizens.  Vermont, a
rural state in contrast to Massachusetts and New York, was selected
because it was one of only eight states that had implemented a
statewide automated prospective drug utilization review system for
Medicaid prior to 1994.  In each state, we obtained information on
the operation of Medicaid drug utilization review systems as well as
various state initiatives to help senior citizens avoid adverse drug
reactions. 

To update the results from earlier research studies, we analyzed data
from HCFA's 1992 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, the most
recently available data.  According to HCFA, this survey is designed
to provide reliable baseline data to project Medicare costs and is
representative of the Medicare population as a whole. 

To determine what causes the inappropriate use of prescription drugs,
we reviewed the literature and interviewed the leading experts
previously cited.  We also obtained information on physician
gerontology education and questioned state officials about the
implementation of drug utilization review programs and their effect
on the causes of the inappropriate use of prescription drugs. 

To determine how physicians, pharmacists, and patients receive
information on drug therapies, we identified actions that drug
manufacturers and FDA have taken to provide better dosage information
for elderly patients as well as changes in how drug manufacturers
disseminate information to physicians, pharmacists, and patients.  We
also obtained information on efforts by state agencies, senior
citizen advocacy groups, pharmacy groups, and medical organizations
to improve communication between and among physicians, pharmacists,
and patients. 

To identify emerging trends in the health care delivery system and
their potential effects on the inappropriate use of prescription
drugs, we obtained information on how managed care plans develop
formularies, train their staff on new drug therapies, and track both
patient and physician use of prescription drugs.  To assess the
effect of the growth of pharmacy benefit management firms, we
obtained information on how these plans coordinate and monitor drug
therapies. 


MEDICARE CURRENT BENEFICIARY
SURVEY
========================================================== Appendix II

The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey is a continuous, multipurpose
survey of a representative sample of the Medicare population.  It is
administered by HCFA's Office of the Actuary and began gathering data
in 1991.  The survey generates data on issues of prime importance to
the management of the Medicare program and the development of health
care policy.  Focusing on health care use and expenditures, the
survey generates data to (1) allow HCFA to monitor the financial
effects of changes in the Medicare program; (2) develop reliable and
current information on the use and cost of services not covered by
Medicare such as prescription drugs and long-term care; and (3)
obtain information on the sources of payments for costs of covered
services not assumed by Medicare.  Although its focus is on the
financing of health care, the survey collects a variety of
information about the Medicare population, including demographic
characteristics, health status, insurance coverage, financial
resources, and family support. 

The survey is based on a sample of Medicare recipients drawn from the
Medicare enrollment file.  The sample is representative of the
Medicare population as a whole.  Since the survey is a longitudinal
study, those selected for participation are interviewed three times a
year for several years to form a continuous profile of their health
care.  Initial participants who completed the first round of
interviews numbered 12,677.  Of these, 942 resided in an
institutional setting and 11,735 were community-based.  The sample is
adjusted annually for attrition and for newly eligible persons. 

The initial interview gathers baseline data on demographic
characteristics, health status, insurance coverage, financial
resources, and family support.  Subsequent interviews gather details
of the participants' health care use since the last interview
emphasizing the type of health care used and the source for paying
for it.  This includes information on the prescription drugs a
participant is using even though Medicare does not provide
reimbursement for their cost. 

Information collected is edited for consistency, documented, and
organized into files.  Later, these files are merged with HCFA claims
payment records.  Also, administrative data such as Medicaid buy-in
status and capitated plan membership are added to the file.  All
personal identifying information is removed. 


20 DRUGS GENERALLY CONSIDERED
INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE ELDERLY
========================================================= Appendix III

Table III.1 lists the 20 drugs deemed generally inappropriate for
elderly patients by a panel of experts.  The reasons given by this
panel for judging a drug inappropriate are also provided as is the
purpose of these drugs.  The panel's results and methodology were
published in 1991.\19 Though the goal of this panel was to identify
drugs inappropriate for the elderly living in a nursing home setting,
a later examination of these drugs by another panel of experts also
judged these drugs as generally inappropriate for elderly patients
living in a community-based setting.\20 Several of the experts we
interviewed agreed that these drugs should normally not be used with
elderly patients though they stressed that there would be some
medical situations where the use of these drugs would be appropriate. 
One expert noted the need for research studies based on
patient-related outcomes data to confirm the views of the expert
panelists.

USE OF DRUGS CONSIDERED GENERALLY
INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE ELDERLY
========================================================== Appendix IV

At our request, HCFA's Office of the Actuary used data from the
Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey to determine the percentage of
community-based elderly who used at least 1 of the 20 drugs
identified in appendix III as generally inappropriate for their age
group.\21 The most current compiled data are for 1992.  The first
step was to identify survey participants who were 65 or older and who
were noninstitutionalized.  Of their survey population, 9,182
participants met these criteria.  This group represented 29,862,854
Medicare beneficiaries nationwide according to HCFA's Office of the
Actuary.  The next step was to determine which of these participants
used at least 1 of the 20 drugs sometime during 1992 and project that
use to the national population.  The results indicated that an
estimated 17.5 percent or 5,219,811 noninstitutionalized Medicare
beneficiaries 65 or older used at least 1 of those drugs during 1992. 

These results are displayed in table IV.1.  Specifically, the table
lists the percentages of noninstitutionalized elderly found to be
using each of the 20 drugs.  The middle column details the results
based on research using data from the 1987 National Medical
Expenditure Survey covering noninstitutionalized residents 65 or
older.\22 The right-hand column presents the results of the analysis
described above.  We did not include the research results based on
interviews conducted during 1989 and 1990 of a sample of
noninstitutionalized elderly 75 or older residing in Santa Monica,
California.\23 This was because the participants in this study
represented one community rather than a national sample and belonged
to a different age group than the other two studies.  In addition,
their use of the 20 drugs was measured during a period of 1 month
versus 1 year in the other 2 analyses.

The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was created in 1988
to develop a national drug control policy, coordinate and oversee
implementation of the strategy by federal drug control agencies, and
evaluate and revise the strategy yearly.  Given the persistent severity
of the drug problem and the large number of federal, state, and local
agencies working on it, a continuing need exists for a central planning
agency to lead and coordinate the nation's war on drugs.  GAO agrees
with the administration that ONDCP should be reauthorized.  However,
ONDCP needs to develop better program evaluation measures for assessing
progress under the annual drug control strategies, such reductions in
hard-core drug use.  In addition, ONDCP and the drug control agencies
needs to cooperate more in developing and assessing drug control policy,
particularly in the area of data collection.  Further, the law should be
changed to afford ONDCP greater flexibility over the conduct of drug
control budget reviews and certification.

<pre>
<font size="2">(Letter Report, 04/04/94, GAO/HEHS-94-89).
<img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">

The 1991 population of young foster care children differs significantly
from the 1986 population in the three locations GAO
reviewed--California, New York, and Pennsylvania, the states with the
largest average foster care populations in 1991.  The 1991 population is
much larger, more of these children entered foster care due to some form
of neglect, these children have more health-related problems and are at
high risk for further problems due to prenatal drug exposure, and they
are more likely to be eligible for federal payments.  Both federal and
state expenditures have felt the impact of the rising number of young
foster children and the decline in their overall health.  Further, two
broad service needs overlap foster and health care programs.  First,
drug abuse treatment programs for biological mothers and pregnant women
are needed to reduce the risks associated with prenatal drug exposure
and the likelihood that children will be removed from their families.
Second, services to address the health and developmental needs of
drug-exposed children are needed to treat their problems. Although few
alternatives to foster care are now available to these families, meeting
these needs should increase the chances for family reunification.
However, drug abuse, to the extent that it persists, will remain a
hidden contributor to the costs of various federal programs.

April 4, 1994

The Honorable Harold E.  Ford
Chairman, Subcommittee on Human Resources
Committee on Ways and Means
House of Representatives

Dear Mr.  Chairman: 

As the nation's policymakers consider national health care and
welfare reforms, the information contained in this report should be
valuable in helping frame policies that can significantly impact one
of our most vulnerable population groups--young foster children--and
their families.  The average number of children in foster care
nationwide increased 53 percent in 5 years, from 280,000 in 1986 to
429,000 in 1991.  The three states we reviewed care for over 50
percent of the foster care population.  In those states, the number
of children in foster care increased about 66 percent during that
period and the number of young foster children--those 36 months of
age and younger--more than doubled.  Additionally, more young foster
children had health-related problems, including prenatal exposure to
drugs, in 1991 than in 1986. 

This report responds to the first of three issues in your request;
that we compare and contrast the population sizes and distinctive
characteristics of young foster children in 1986 and 1991.  As
agreed, we plan to report later on the two remaining issues:  (1) how
and to what extent the service needs of young foster children are
identified and met, and (2) the areas where federal assistance to
states could best serve the needs of young foster children and
increase their chances of becoming self-sufficient or, at a minimum,
less dependent on government assistance later in life. 

We reviewed foster care programs in California, New York, and
Pennsylvania, the states with the largest average foster care
populations in 1991.  We analyzed statewide foster care databases for
California and New York and reviewed random samples of case files for
1986\1 and 1991 from those of 32,123 young foster children in three
locations:  Los Angeles County, New York City, and Philadelphia
County.\2 These locations cared for a substantial portion of each
state's young foster children in 1991:  44 percent in California, 81
percent in New York, and 29 percent in Pennsylvania. 


--------------------
\1 For one location in the 1986 sample, program officials could not
locate about 40 percent of the requested case files.  Appendix I
describes the steps we took to ensure that comparisons between 1986
and 1991 case file review results were appropriate. 

\2 Pennsylvania does not have a statewide foster care database; to
review this state's foster care program we relied on summaries that
the state compiles from aggregate data submitted by its counties. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

The 1991 population of young foster children is significantly
different from the 1986 population in the locations reviewed in a
variety of ways:  the 1991 population size is much larger, more of
these children entered foster care due to some form of neglect, their
biological parents are more likely to abuse drugs, these children
have more health-related problems and are at high risk for further
problems due to prenatal drug exposure,\3 and they are more likely to
be eligible for federal maintenance payments. 

The number of young foster children increased at almost twice the
rate of the general foster care population.  Neglect and caretaker
absence prompted an estimated 68 percent of removals, up from 47
percent in 1986.  We estimate that families where at least one parent
was a drug abuser increased from 52 percent to 78 percent.  An
increasing percentage of children had serious health-related problems
in 1991 and most of them were prenatally exposed to drugs. 
Specifically, an estimated 58 percent of young foster children had
serious health-related problems in 1991 compared with 43 percent in
1986.  Those at high risk for problems due to prenatal drug exposure
increased from 29 percent to 62 percent over this period.  Cocaine
was the most prevalent drug children were prenatally exposed to in
both years; documented prenatal cocaine exposure increased from 17
percent to 55 percent between 1986 and 1991.  A larger percentage of
young foster children qualified for federal maintenance payments in
1991 than previously.  At the same time, the growing number of young
foster children increased overall maintenance expenditures,
compounding their financial impact on government.  Federal and state
governments in these three states alone spent over $2 billion in 1992
to maintain foster children of all ages. 

These changes have implications for federal foster care and health
care programs.  Both federal and state expenditures have felt the
impact of the growth in the number of young foster children and the
decline in their overall level of health.  Further, two broad service
needs overlap foster and health care programs.  First, drug abuse
treatment programs for biological mothers and pregnant women are
needed to reduce the risks associated with prenatal drug exposure and
the likelihood that children will be removed from their families. 
Second, services to address the health and developmental needs of
drug-exposed children are needed to treat their problems.  While few
alternatives to foster care currently exist for many of these
families, meeting both of these service needs should increase the
possibility that such families can be reunified and leave the foster
care system.  However, drug abuse, to the extent it continues to
occur, will remain a hidden contributor to the costs of various
federal programs. 


--------------------
\3 We included alcohol abuse in our definition of drug abuse. 
However, the documented incidence of alcohol use was low, about 6
percent in 1991 and 3 percent in 1986. 


   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

While the federal, state, and county governments and foster parents
share responsibility for providing care and services to foster
children, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is
responsible for the management and oversight of federal programs
benefiting foster children.  The programs are authorized primarily by
the Social Security Act.  The act, in part, authorizes expenditures
to (1) maintain foster children who are eligible under the Aid to
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, (2) assist states in
providing child welfare services, and (3) provide medical care. 
Primarily, HHS establishes federal regulations and monitors states'
compliance with them for children placed in federally funded foster
care and other programs under the act and administers federal funding
for them. 

Federal expenditures for the administration and maintenance of
AFDC-eligible foster children are authorized under title IV-E of the
Social Security Act.  Those expenditures increased from about $637
million in 1986 to over $2.2 billion nationwide in 1992.  The federal
portion of foster care maintenance costs varies by state and is
linked to a state's Medicaid matching rate.  The federal portion
ranges from 50 percent to 83 percent of the maintenance cost for
AFDC-eligible foster children; states or counties are responsible for
the full cost of maintaining foster children who are not eligible for
AFDC benefits.  Thus, payments to foster parents for the care of an
AFDC-eligible foster child are comprised of federal, state, and in
some cases county monies. 

In addition to maintenance funds under title IV-E, federal funds
authorized in other titles of the Social Security Act may be used to
provide medical and other needed services to foster children.  States
may participate in programs such as title IV-B, federal matching
grants for various child welfare services; title XIX, Medicaid, for
medical services for foster children; and, title XX, block grants for
a wide array of social services for children.  Data were unavailable
to estimate the additional federal, state, and county expenditures
for these other services for foster children.  However, we previously
reported that median costs associated with newborn medical care for
infants known to be prenatally drug-exposed were approximately $1,100
to $4,100 higher (in 1989 dollars) than for other infants.  Further,
an HHS study provides an example of Medicaid costs in California from
1986 to 1988 for children from birth to 24 months of age.  HHS
reported a 2-year average Medicaid expenditure of $1,551 for children
who were not identified as being prenatally exposed to drugs compared
to $2,285 for those who were known to be exposed.\4 Further, medical
expenses for drug-exposed foster children from birth to 12 months of
age were 62 percent greater than the medical expenses for
drug-exposed children who were not in foster care. 


--------------------
\4 An Exploratory Analysis of the Medicaid Expenditures of Substance
Exposed Children Under 2 Years of Age in California, Office of the
Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and Health Care
Financing Administration, HHS (1993) (study prepared by SysteMetrics,
a division of MEDSTAT Systems, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.).  The average
was calculated for all children receiving Medicaid benefits in
California, not just foster children.  It also excluded costs for the
federally mandated Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and
Treatment (EPSDT) services and delivery services at birth.  However,
we believe that this is a reasonable minimum estimate of average
costs for foster children as well. 


   MORE YOUNG CHILDREN IN FOSTER
   CARE
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

The foster care populations in the states reviewed increased
dramatically between 1986 and 1991, with the number of young foster
children increasing at a faster rate.  The total foster care
population in these states increased 66 percent while the number of
young foster children increased 110 percent.  During the same years,
the total number of young children in these states increased 19
percent, indicating that a greater percentage of all young children
in these states entered foster care in 1991 than entered previously. 
(See fig.  1 and tables II.1-II.4 in app.  II.)

   Figure 1:  Increase in Foster
   Care and Child Populations in
   Three States Between 1986 and
   1991

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Note:  Part of New York's increase in foster children is due to the
provisions of the New York Supreme Court case, Eugene F., which
required all foster children placed with relatives to be included in
foster care caseloads and eligible for services.

Pennsylvania's count of &quot;Young Foster Children&quot; consists of all
foster children under age 5, as its aggregate data did not break out
children under age 3.

California and New York foster children counts represent all children
in foster care at any time during the review year; Pennsylvania data
for foster children represent year-end counts, as comparable data
were not available. 

Sources:  California and New York--state databases;
Pennsylvania--aggregated state data; except &quot;All Children and All
Young Children&quot;--Bureau of the Census midyear estimates. 


   NEGLECTFUL OR ABSENT PARENTS
   TRIGGERED MOST REMOVALS FROM
   HOME
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

Neglect and caretaker absence or incapacity were the primary reasons
why young children were removed from their families in both
California and New York, the states where data were available. 
Together, these reasons accounted for approximately 47 percent and 68
percent of the removals in 1986 and 1991, respectively.  No other
reasons for removals, such as physical abuse, accounted for a large
portion of the entries of young children into foster care in either
year.  For example, all types of abuse accounted for 11 percent of
the removals of young children in 1986 and 7 percent in 1991.  (See
fig.  2 and table II.6 in app.  II.)

   Figure 2:  Reasons for Removal
   of Young Children From Home in
   California and New York

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Note:  There were other reasons for removals that did not account for
significant portions of total removals.  In addition, some cases only
show broad service program categories, such as &quot;court ordered
placement;&quot; others are listed as unknown or error. 

\a Includes removals due to neglect, caretaker absence or incapacity,
relinquishment, and voluntary placements. 

\b Consists of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. 

\c Consists of New York data only.  This state uses up to two reasons
for removal, thus, abuse and/or neglect can be cited.  Further, the
definitions of some reasons for removal, such as Health/Safety, refer
to abuse and/or neglect. 

Source:  State electronic databases. 


      DRUG ABUSE FURTHER IMPACTS
      TROUBLED FAMILIES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1

To better describe the parents' situation around the time their
children were removed from home, we reviewed random samples of case
files for certain difficulties that families face in the three
locations reviewed.  Of these situations, estimated increases in the
number of parents who abused drugs or had other children in foster
care are significant between 1986 and 1991.  Fully 78 percent of the
young foster children reviewed had at least one parent who was
abusing drugs or alcohol in 1991 compared with 52 percent in 1986. 
Families with other children in foster care increased from 68 percent
to 79 percent.  Further, families with no other children decreased
from an estimated 18 percent to 11 percent during this time. 

Families in 1991 had additional serious problems in common with their
counterparts in 1986 in the three locations.  For example, the
percentage of young foster children who came from families with at
least one parent absent was high in both years, estimated at about 70
percent.  In addition, over 27 percent of the young foster children
in these years came from families where both parents were absent from
the home around the time of the child's removal, according to our
estimates.  (See fig.  3 and table II.7 in app.  II.)

The urgent need for attention to the problems that these families
face is underscored by the facts that in 1991, about one-third of
these families were comprised of drug-abusing single mothers and most
had more than one child in foster care.  Without treatment programs
designed for pregnant women and mothers, women are likely to continue
using drugs, leaving few alternatives to foster care for these
families.  Yet, as we previously reported, access to treatment
programs for pregnant women is lacking.\5

   MORE CHILDREN ARE ILL OR AT
   HIGH RISK
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

Young children in foster care have or are at high risk for a wide
range of health problems.  In the locations reviewed, young foster
children with serious physical health problems increased
significantly, to an estimated 58 percent; similarly, 62 percent of
them were at high risk for serious health problems due to prenatal
drug exposure in 1991.  The comparable estimates for 1986 were 43
percent and 29 percent, respectively.\6 (See fig.  4 and table II.8
in app.  II.)

   Figure 4:  Health Conditions of
   Young Foster Children in Three
   Counties

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

\a Consists of prenatal drug exposure (including alcohol exposure)
and drug withdrawal or symptoms. 

\b Consists of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), low birth weight,
cardiac defects or heart problems, HIV positive or AIDS,
developmentally delayed, and other serious problems. 

\c Consists of psychologically disturbed and behavioral problems. 

\d Consists of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. 

\e Differences are not statistically significant at the 95-percent
confidence level. 

\f Consists of children who did not have any of the above conditions. 
However, these children may have had minor illnesses. 

Source:  Case file review. 

Medical research suggests that the chronic illnesses these children
have or are at risk for, such as developmental delays, may have been
caused or compounded by prenatal exposure to drugs and alcohol. 
Supportive services and treatment beyond those needed by the average
child will be required for many of them. 

In addition, the number of drug-exposed children may be
underestimated.  We relied on mothers' self-reporting of drug use as
well as the more objective toxicology tests.  Yet, not all children
or mothers are tested at birth for drugs and, when tested, only
recent drug use can be confirmed.  In 1991 only 59 percent of young
foster children were known to have received a toxicology test at
birth to determine prenatal drug exposure in the days before
delivery.  We previously reported that hospitals differ in their
efforts to identify drug-exposed infants.\7 Further, while hospitals
serving primarily Medicaid patients are more likely to perform
toxicology tests than those serving primarily non-Medicaid patients,
drug use during pregnancy is as likely to occur among privately
insured women as among those relying on public assistance for their
health care. 


--------------------
\6 We considered a child to be prenatally drug-exposed if any of the
following conditions were documented in the child's foster care
records:  mother self-reported drug use during pregnancy, toxicology
test results for mother or infant were positive for drug use, or
infant was diagnosed as having drug-withdrawal symptoms.

28, 1990). 


      COCAINE USE ESCALATED
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1

Cocaine was the most prevalent drug that young foster children were
known to be prenatally exposed to in both years.  The percentage of
young foster children estimated to have been prenatally exposed to
cocaine increased significantly, from 17 percent in 1986 to 55
percent in 1991.  Because toxicology tests cannot identify the form
of cocaine used, we often could not determine whether crack or
another form of cocaine had been used; however, in some cases mothers
self-reported crack use.  Of the children who were prenatally
drug-exposed in 1991, 24 percent of their mothers used more than one
kind of drug during pregnancy.  (See fig.  5 and table II.9 in app. 
II.)

   Figure 5:  Prenatal Drug
   Exposure in Three Counties

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

\a Includes crack and other cocaine derivatives. 

\b Includes heroin and methadone. 

\c Differences are not statistically significant at the 95-percent
confidence level. 

\d Includes methamphetamines. 

Source:  Case file review. 

The increased use of cocaine by the mothers of young foster children
adds additional urgency to the need for drug treatment programs if
the impact of drug abuse on foster care is to be alleviated.  Studies
have found that prenatal cocaine exposure can be addictive and can
result in withdrawal symptoms, direct injuries, and disabling effects
on developing fetuses.  When the crack derivative of cocaine is used,
the user can become addicted much more quickly and the effects of the
exposure on the fetus are more severe.  We previously reported that
researchers attribute crack's popularity among women to its low cost
and the users' perception that smoking a drug is more acceptable and
less intrusive than injecting one.\8 Further, we reported that a
study of prostitutes found that cocaine and crack users are as likely
as intravenous drug users to test positive for the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS.  Other research has
found that mothers who abuse cocaine are likely to have three to five
children.  Thus, cocaine-abusing women may have a greater impact on
both the foster and health care systems than users of other drugs.

   FOSTER CARE COSTS INCREASED
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6

A greater portion of foster care maintenance expenditures for young
children shifted to the federal government between 1986 and 1991,
compounding the impact of the increase in overall foster care
maintenance costs.  Much of the 110-percent growth in the population
of young foster children between 1986 and 1991 occurred among those
who were AFDC-eligible for federal matching funds, thereby placing
even greater financial responsibility on the federal level.  (See
fig.  6 and table II.10 in app.  II.)

   Figure 6:  Sources of Foster
   Care Maintenance Funding in
   California and New York

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Source:  State electronic databases. 

For the three states reviewed--California, New York, and
Pennsylvania--total foster care maintenance expenditures, including
both state and federal portions, increased from about $848 million in
1986 to over $2 billion in 1992.\9 In 1992, foster parents of young
children received a minimum monthly payment of $345 in California,
$353 in New York, and $330 in Pennsylvania.  However, foster parents
can receive much higher payments to care for children with special
needs.  For example, in New York City, foster parents caring for very
sick children can be paid as much as $1,281 per month for each child
in their care.  Further, if foster children require specialized care
in a group setting, maintenance payments could be even higher; for
example, the maximum monthly payment is $4,762 in Los Angeles County.

SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
=========================================================== Appendix I

To accomplish the objectives of our review, we obtained and analyzed
data on state foster care programs and the children in them from the
three states with the largest average monthly foster care populations
in 1991--California, New York, and Pennsylvania.  Over 50 percent of
the nations's foster children are under the jurisdiction of the three
states we reviewed. 

We used a variety of approaches to meet our objectives.  We analyzed
electronic state and county foster care databases; conducted a case
file review based on generalizable random samples; interviewed
Department of Health and Human Services, state, and county foster
care officials; conducted a telephone survey of child welfare
advocacy groups and other child welfare experts; conducted group
interviews with foster parents and case workers; reviewed foster care
and related literature; reviewed applicable portions of the Social
Security Act and other legislation; and reviewed foster care agency
regulations and other documents. 


   STATEWIDE DATA
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1

To determine the foster care population size, reasons for removal,
and funding eligibility of young foster children, we analyzed
electronic foster care databases for states where they were
available, California and New York.  State officials provided us with
automated records for all children who were in foster care at any
time during calendar years 1986 and 1991. 

We could not obtain comparable electronic records for Pennsylvania as
that state has not established an automated case record system. 
Instead we relied on aggregate data available in management reports
for 1986 and 1991 to determine the size of the state foster care
population.  Thus, we relied on end-of-year data, which undercounts
the total foster care population for that state. 

To determine the population size for all children in the three
states, we used 1986 and 1991 Bureau of the Census midyear estimates. 


   COUNTY CASE FILE DATA
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2

To determine additional characteristics of young foster children, we
reviewed statistically representative samples of foster care case
files for the county with the largest foster care population in 1991
for each of the states reviewed.  To identify those locations, we
again used the state foster care databases for California and New
York; for Pennsylvania, we relied on information provided by state
officials.  The counties identified are Los Angeles County, New York
City, and Philadelphia County, respectively.\1 To complete our
sampling, Philadelphia County officials provided us with an
electronic database of foster children in that county in 1986 and
1991.  Table I.1 shows the number of children in that county whose
electronic records were initially supplied to us by county officials
and the final number of children whose records remained after we
expunged records that did not meet our criteria because they were for
children who were in emergency homeless shelters, not foster care.

------------------------------------------------------------
Before drawing the sample, we narrowed the databases to include only
foster children whose third birthday occurred no later than December
31 in the year under review.  In addition, we stratified the foster
care records of the 32,123 young foster children in our population by
location and by year.  Our initial samples contained 932 children. 
The population and initial sample sizes are shown in table I.2.

------------------------------------------------------------
\a Sample size totals are provided to indicate the composition of the
initial samples.  When used in analyses, sample strata were weighted. 

We requested all foster care case files for each child in the
samples.  A few case files were dropped from the samples because the
child did not meet the criteria of being in foster care during the
review year or was not of the appropriate age.  In addition, other
case files were dropped because county officials could not locate
them.  In particular, for one county, many of the 1986 case files we
requested could not be found.  By comparing demographic data for
available and unavailable case files in that county, we determined
that the two groups had similar characteristics.  Further, state and
county program officials told us that they are unaware of differences
between the available and unavailable case files and believe that
they represent the same population.  We concluded that the dropped
case files were likely to be analogous to those we reviewed.  Thus,
we used them for comparisons with 1991. 

Our final sample size was 759 young foster children.  We used an
adjusted population size, inversely proportional to our dropout rate,
to project to the county level; however, the data cannot be projected
to these states as a whole or to the national population of foster
children.  Initial and final sample sizes, along with the percentages
of the initial samples used, are shown in table I.3.

------------------------------------------------------------
\a Percentage totals are weighted averages showing the percentage of
the total population covered by the final samples. 

We examined the foster care case files beginning at a child's first
entry into foster care until the end of the review year or until the
child was discharged from foster care, whichever occurred earlier. 
We used an automated data collection instrument to record information
from the case files.  The recorded information was reviewed for
accuracy by the individual preparing it before finalizing each
electronic record.  We also reviewed the case file data for
consistent coding among individuals; minor adjustments were made to
the coding as a result of that review. 

We analyzed the case file data using univariate analysis, a
descriptive statistical method.  We also used a t-test to determine
statistically significant differences between the 1986 and 1991 data. 
In addition, when combining the strata, we weighted them to adjust
for disproportionate sampling.  Finally, we found that results from
the three locations were similar; thus, the locations could be
combined for analysis. 

For data derived from the case file review, the percentage estimates
reported in the letter and the numerical estimates reported in
appendix II are point estimates.  The precision of these estimates
varies with the quantitative relationship of a number of attributes
in a population.  We are 95-percent confident that the point
estimates fall within the confidence intervals reported in appendix
II.  Conversely, there is a 5-percent chance that the confidence
intervals do not contain the actual population. 

We performed limited tests of the completeness of the case files. 
However, we did not independently verify the accuracy of the
electronic databases provided to us by state and county officials.

\a California and New York counts of foster children represent all
young children who were in foster care at any time during the review
year. 

\b Pennsylvania's state count of young foster children represents
year-end counts, as data on the total number of young children in
foster care at any time during the year were not available.  Further,
that count is for foster children under the age of 5 years, as its
aggregate data did not break out children under age 3 years. 
However, the count for the selected county represents all children
under age 3 years who were in foster care at any time during the
year. 

Sources:  California and New York--state databases;
Pennsylvania--aggregate state data and county database.

Note:  There were other reasons for removals that did not account for
significant portions of total removals.  In addition, some cases only
show broad service program categories, such as &quot;court ordered
placement,&quot; and others are listed as unknown or error. 

\a Includes removals due to neglect, caretaker absence or incapacity,
relinquishment, and voluntary placements. 

\b Consists of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. 

\c Consists of New York data only.  This state uses up to two reasons
for removal, thus, abuse and/or neglect can be cited.  In addition,
the definitions of some reasons for removal, such as Health/Safety,
refer to abuse and/or neglect.

<h1>Juvenile Justice: Juveniles Processed In Criminal Court and
Case<br>
Dispositions </h1>

<pre>
<font size="2">(Letter Report, 08/15/95, GAO/GGD-95-170).
<img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">

Pursuant to a legislative requirement, GAO reviewed the frequency with
which juveniles have been sent to criminal court, focusing on: (1)
juvenile conviction rates and sentences in criminal court; (2)
dispositions of juvenile cases in juvenile court; and (3) conditions of
confinement for juveniles incarcerated in adult correctional facilities.

GAO found that: (1) less than 2 percent of the juvenile delinquency
cases filed in juvenile court from 1988 through 1992 were transferred to
criminal court; (2) in states that permitted prosecutor direct filing,
between 1 and 13 percent of the juvenile cases were referred directly to
criminal court; (3) state laws that excluded certain juveniles from
juvenile court jurisdiction mainly focused on violent offenses or
juveniles with previous court records; (4) new state laws have generally
increased the frequency in which juveniles are sent to criminal court by
either decreasing the age or increasing the types of offenses for which
juveniles may be sent to criminal court; (5) juveniles in six of the
seven states studied tended to be convicted when prosecuted in criminal
court, most often for property offenses; (6) between 3 to 50 percent of
the juveniles convicted of serious violent offenses received probation;
(7) in four of the seven states, juvenile incarceration rates for
violent, property, and drug offenses were between 62 and 100 percent;
(8) in the 744,000 formal delinquency cases filed in 1992, 43 percent of
the juveniles received probation, 27 percent of the cases were
dismissed, 17 percent of the juveniles were placed in residential
treatment, 12 percent received other disposition, and 1 percent were
transferred to criminal court; and (9) in three of the states studied,
the juveniles sentenced to adult prisons were housed in separate
prisons, but health, recreation, and educational services were
equivalent in all seven states' facilities.

Chairman
The Honorable Joseph R.  Biden, Jr.

The 1992 reauthorization (P.L.  102-586) of the Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (P.L.  93-415) mandated that we
study issues related to juveniles sent to criminal court versus
juvenile court.  We agreed with your Committees to obtain data on (1)
the frequency with which juveniles have been sent to criminal court,
(2) the juvenile conviction rates and sentences in criminal court,
(3) the dispositions of juvenile cases in juvenile court, and (4) the
conditions of confinement for juveniles incarcerated in adult
correctional facilities.  In addition, we agreed to provide a summary
of state laws that specify the circumstances under which juveniles
can be sent to criminal court. 

According to the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), juveniles are committing increasing
numbers of serious crimes such as murder and aggravated assaults. 
The number of juvenile court cases involving these offenses increased
by 68 percent from 1988 to 1992.  Each state has at least one of
three methods--judicial waiver, prosecutor direct filing, statutory
exclusion (state laws requiring the transfer of juveniles for certain
crimes)--available for transferring juveniles to criminal court.  In
recent years, many states have changed their laws to expand the
criteria under which juveniles may be sent to criminal court. 

Due to the increasing numbers of juveniles sent to criminal court and
legislative changes, juvenile justice advocates, experts, and
officials have raised concerns about the number of juveniles being
tried in criminal court. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

Data limitations precluded us from determining the number of
juveniles sent to criminal court nationwide.  However, we were able
to obtain some nationwide data on the number of judicial waivers.  In
addition, we obtained some state data on the number of prosecutor
direct filing cases.  Data on the number of statutory exclusion cases
were not available. 

Our analysis of nationwide estimates from the National Center for
Juvenile Justice (NCJJ)\1 showed that juvenile court judges
transferred to criminal court less than 2 percent of juvenile
delinquency cases that were filed in juvenile court from 1988 through
1992.  Over that period, cases transferred by judges increased from
1.2 to 1.6 percent of formal delinquency cases.\2

Additionally, the state data we obtained from five states and the
District of Columbia and the county data we obtained for a few
counties in five other states showed that the number of juvenile
cases filed directly in criminal court in the states that permitted
prosecutor direct filing ranged from less than 1 percent to 13
percent.  For example, based on data obtained, prosecutor direct
filing cases represented about 13 percent of juvenile cases in
Arkansas and less than 1 percent in Utah. 

Because data were not available on the number of cases excluded by
statute from juvenile court, we reviewed state statutes to identify
the possible impact of the statutes on the juveniles.  Our review of
state laws that exclude certain juveniles from juvenile court
jurisdiction showed that the laws primarily focused on serious
violent offenses and/or juveniles with prior court records. 

Since 1978, 44 states and the District of Columbia have passed new
laws that affect which juveniles may be sent to criminal court and
the process for their transfer to criminal court.  While some of the
new state laws are expected to have an impact on the frequency with
which juveniles are sent to criminal court, the extent of the impact
may vary. 

In 24 states and the District of Columbia, the new laws have
generally increased the population of juveniles potentially subject
to being sent to criminal court.  This was done by either decreasing
the age or increasing the types of offenses for which juveniles may
be sent to criminal court.  For example, in California the population
of juveniles that juvenile court judges can waive to criminal court
changed from age 16 for any offense to age 14 for specified offenses
and age 16 for other offenses.  Also, in New Jersey, offenses such as
first degree robbery and some weapons offenses have been added to the
list of offenses that may be judicially waived. 

Three states passed laws that tended to decrease the population of
juveniles potentially subject to being sent to criminal court.  The
other 17 states that passed new laws did not increase the population
of juveniles potentially subject to being sent to criminal court.  In
these states, the new laws changed the method in which certain
juveniles may be sent to criminal court.  For example, in Minnesota
in 1978, a child age 14 or older charged with any offense could be
judicially waived to criminal court.  Currently, however, a child age
16 or older charged with first degree murder is statutorily excluded
from juvenile court rather than eligible for judicial waiver. 
Appendix IV summarizes the laws of each state and the District of
Columbia. 

According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics' 1989 and 1990 Offender
Based Transaction Statistics (OBTS) data from seven states,\3
conviction rates of juveniles prosecuted in criminal court for
serious violent, serious property, and drug offenses varied within
and among states.  However, juveniles in six of those states tended
to be convicted.  Of those juveniles convicted, property offenses
made up the largest proportion of juvenile convictions in five of the
seven states.  Further, in four of seven states incarceration rates
ranged from 62 to 100 percent for all three offenses.  Of those 703
juveniles incarcerated in the seven states, serious violent offenders
and serious property offenders accounted for the same proportion of
juveniles incarcerated, 39 percent.  In contrast, some juveniles
convicted of serious violent offenses received probation in five of
the seven states.  The percentages varied from 3 percent in
California to 50 percent in Vermont. 

We were requested to provide data on the disposition of juveniles in
juvenile court.  According to OJJDP data, many juveniles were placed
on probation in juvenile court.  In 1992, juveniles were placed on
probation in about 43 percent of approximately 744,000 formal
delinquency cases.  Of the remaining 57 percent of juvenile cases, 27
percent were dismissed, 17 percent of the juveniles were placed in a
residential treatment program, and 12 percent of them received some
other disposition such as restitution, fines, or community service. 
About 1 percent were transferred to criminal court. 

In the four states we visited, juveniles sentenced to adult prisons
generally were to be subject to the same policies and procedures as
adults; however, in three of the four states we visited, younger
inmates (typically those under age 26) were housed in separate
prisons.  At all the facilities, juveniles generally were to be
provided with the same health services; afforded the same
educational, vocational, and work opportunities; and provided access
to the same recreational facilities as older inmates.

   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

A juvenile is an individual at or below the maximum age of juvenile
court jurisdiction.  Established by state statute, the maximum age of
juvenile court jurisdiction is the oldest age at which an individual
can be processed in juvenile court.\4

Individuals who are above the maximum age of juvenile court
jurisdiction are considered adults and therefore are under criminal
court jurisdiction.  In 39 states and the District of Columbia the
maximum age is 17.  In 11 states,\5 the maximum age is either 15 or
16.  Except for Wyoming (where the maximum age dropped from age 18 to
17), the maximum age had not changed in any state, when comparing the
state laws in 1978 with the laws in 1994. 

Although the organization of state juvenile justice systems varies,
two options are generally provided for processing juvenile
delinquency cases--formal and informal.  An authorized court official
(e.g., juvenile prosecutor or juvenile probation officer) decides
whether to process the case formally through the court system or
informally by diverting the case from the juvenile court. 

For handling formal cases, a petition must be drafted and filed to
provide notice of the offenses that will be pursued and to request
the court to adjudicate--judicially determine (judge) whether or not
the youth is a delinquent offender.\6 For informal cases there is no
formal court petition or legal instrument requesting the court to
adjudicate the youth as a delinquent.  Whether the case is handled
formally or informally, juveniles receive dispositions.  Disposition
options may include dismissal of the case, probation, fines or
restitution, community service, and placement. 

A juvenile who is at or below the maximum age of juvenile court
jurisdiction may be sent to criminal court by one of the following
three methods: 

  judicial waiver, which allows juvenile court judges to transfer
     juveniles to criminal court.  Generally, prosecutors initiate
     judicial waiver by filing a waiver petition asking the judge to
     consider the case for waiver;

  prosecutor direct filing, which allows prosecutors to decide
     whether to file certain cases in juvenile or criminal court;

  application of statutory exclusion laws, which specify crimes or
     juveniles with certain prior records that are excluded from
     juvenile court jurisdiction. 

For each method, the prosecutor plays an important role in
determining whether a juvenile will be sent to criminal court.  For
example, the offense with which the prosecutor charges the accused
can determine whether the juvenile falls under a state's criteria for
criminal court prosecution. 

Juveniles prosecuted in state criminal court are subject to the same
state court procedures and sentencing guidelines as other defendants
in criminal court. 


--------------------
\4 Most states have given the juvenile court authority over juveniles
who are above the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction.  This
is called the extended age of juvenile court jurisdiction.  It is the
age at which the juvenile court can retain jurisdiction of a juvenile
adjudicated as a delinquent.  For example, in Michigan where the
maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction is age 16, a juvenile who
is adjudicated in juvenile court as a delinquent and has a
disposition that extends beyond the upper age of juvenile court
jurisdiction would still be under the jurisdiction of the juvenile
court until age 21. 

\5 In Connecticut, New York, and North Carolina the maximum age of
juvenile court jurisdiction is 15.  In Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, South Carolina, and Texas the
maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction is 16. 

\6 In the remainder of this report, cases where the intake decision
is to proceed formally will be referred to as formal cases. 


   SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

To determine the frequency with which juveniles were sent to criminal
court, we developed estimates of the number of juvenile cases
transferred to criminal court by juvenile court judges (judicial
waiver) using the NCJJ national data--National Juvenile Court Data
Archive (NJCDA)--for calendar years 1988 through 1992.  As part of
our analysis of judicial waivers, we developed estimates of the age,
sex, race, and offense profiles of juveniles transferred to criminal
court by judges in Arizona, California, Florida, Missouri,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Utah. 

Data limitations precluded us from developing estimates of the total
number of juvenile cases filed directly in criminal court by
prosecutors (prosecutor direct filing) and those juveniles excluded
from juvenile court because of the offense committed and/or prior
court records (statutory exclusion) in those states permitting these
methods.  We did, however, contact state court officials in the
District of Columbia and 10 states that we identified as having
direct filing laws and analyzed data they provided.  We analyzed the
statutory exclusion laws in the District of Columbia and 37 states
that we identified as having these laws to determine the types of
offenses and/or prior court records that exclude juveniles from
juvenile court.\7

To analyze the sentences of juveniles tried in criminal court,\8

we used criminal court data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\9
We identified offenses, conviction rates, and incarceration rates in
California, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Pennsylvania,
and Vermont. 

To gather prosecutors opinions on data related to the processing of
juveniles in criminal courts, we sent a survey to a nationally
representative sample of district prosecutor offices that dealt with
juveniles in juvenile court. 

To determine the conditions of confinement for juveniles in
correctional facilities, we visited seven prisons in Florida,
Michigan, North Carolina, and Ohio. 

To provide a summary of state laws governing which juveniles may be
sent to criminal court, we reviewed the statutes for all 50 states
and the District of Columbia. 

Appendix I presents more details about our objectives, scope, and
methodology, including a discussion of how we selected the states and
prisons we visited.  Our results apply to states and prisons for
which we collected data and cannot be projected to other locations. 
We did not verify data provided by the states.  We did our work from
May 1993 through April 1995 in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards.  Since no federal agency has
responsibility for the issues addressed in this report, we did not
obtain comments on a draft of this report.  However, we did discuss
our results with NCJJ and OJJDP officials and, where appropriate,
incorporated their comments. 


--------------------
\7 An analysis of state laws under which juveniles may be sent to
criminal court focused on the laws in effect during calendar year
1978 (Youth in Adult Courts:  Between Two Worlds, Hamparian, 1982). 
We used this study as the baseline for our analysis of the changes
that were made in the state laws regarding the basis on which
juveniles may be sent to criminal court.  Our analysis focused on the
laws passed through 1994, some of which were not in effect until
1995. 

\8 We classified cases as juveniles on the basis of the defendants'
age at the time of arrest because data were not available for the
defendants' age at the time of offense. 

\9 The Bureau's dataset did not contain all dispositions occurring in
a given year, only those reported to the state and for which the
state had a previous arrest reported. 


   LIMITED DATA AVAILABLE
   INDICATED RELATIVELY FEW
   JUVENILES SENT TO CRIMINAL
   COURT
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

Limited nationwide and state data existed on the total number of
juvenile cases sent to criminal court.  However, we obtained
information on the number of juvenile cases sent to criminal court by
judicial waiver and some information on the number sent by prosecutor
direct filing.  Since data on statutory exclusions were not
available, we analyzed state statutes to identify the possible impact
of the statutes on juveniles. 

According to our analysis of NCJJ data, the rate at which juvenile
court judges sent formal delinquency cases to criminal court has
remained less than 2 percent from 1988 to 1992.  Additionally, data
available from 5 states, the District of Columbia, and a few counties
in 5 other states on the number of prosecutor direct filing cases
filed in criminal court annually showed that it ranged from 4 cases
in one state to about 7,200 cases in another state.  Our analysis of
statutory exclusion laws indicated that the laws generally
established specific criteria that focused on juveniles (1) charged
with serious violent offenses and/or (2) with previous court records. 
In addition, our analysis showed that legislation passed in the last
16 years included two primary types of changes:  (1) in 24 states and
the District of Columbia legislative changes tended to increase the
population of juveniles who may be sent to criminal court and (2) in
17 other states, recent legislation changed the method in which
certain juveniles may be sent to criminal court (e.g., from the
judicial waiver to the prosecutor direct filing). 

The results of our national survey of state prosecutors suggested
that in most prosecutorial offices, judicial waivers accounted for a
higher percentage of juveniles arriving in criminal court than direct
filings or statutory exclusions. 


      TRANSFER AND SENTENCING OF
      JUVENILES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1

We identified (1) judicial waiver laws in 47 states and the District
of Columbia, (2) prosecutor direct filing laws in 10 states and the
District of Columbia, and (3) one or more statutory exclusion laws in
37 states and the District of Columbia. 

We also identified 21 states with provisions that allow criminal
court judges to transfer cases from criminal court to juvenile court
under circumstances specified in the law (reverse waiver).  For
example, in Arkansas, when a prosecutor directly files a case in
criminal court, the criminal court judge may remand the case to
juvenile court.  In addition, we identified 19 states that allow
juveniles prosecuted and convicted in criminal court to receive
dispositions as a juvenile under specified circumstances.  For
example, in California a juvenile convicted in criminal court may
receive a disposition as a juvenile if the California Youth Authority
determines that the juvenile is amenable to treatment. 

See table 1 for a summary of the state statutes and appendix IV for a
detailed summary of statutes in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia that govern which juveniles may be sent to criminal court.

      INCREASED FROM 1988 THROUGH
      1992
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.2

The percent of formal delinquency cases judicially waived to criminal
court (judicial waiver rate) increased by 33 percent from 1.2 percent
in 1988 to 1.6 percent in 1992, which represented a growth from about
7,000 to almost 12,000 cases a year, as shown in table 2.  This
increase occurred while the total number of formal delinquency cases
increased by about 31 percent; the number of waived cases increased
about 68 percent.

Note:  The broad offense categories used in our analysis included
person, property, drugs, and public order as defined by OJJDP.  The
person category includes criminal homicide, forcible rape, robbery,
aggravated assault, simple assault, and other person offenses--such
as kidnapping and harassment.  The property category includes
burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, arson, vandalism, stolen
property offenses, trespassing, and other property offenses--such as
fraud, counterfeiting, and embezzlement.  The drug category includes
unlawful sale, purchase, distribution, manufacture, cultivation,
transport, possession or use of a controlled or prohibited substance
or drug.  The public order category includes weapons offenses,
nonviolent sex offenses, and liquor law violations. 

\a The waiver rate is the ratio of the number of waived cases to the
number of formal delinquency cases.  The percentage of all
delinquency cases which were handled formally varied across states.

Data showed that judicial waiver rates varied by offense type, as
shown in table 3.  The judicial waiver rate for person offenses in
1992 was 2.4 percent in contrast to the waiver rate for property
offenses, which was 1.3 percent.  Therefore, judges were more likely
to waive cases to criminal court involving juveniles charged with
person offenses than juveniles charged with property offenses in
1992.  While the waiver rates for all the offenses increased from
1988 through 1992, the waiver rates for drug offenses increased the
most; however, the rate decreased between 1991 and 1992.\10

While the chances of juvenile cases being waived to criminal court
were highest for juveniles charged with person and drug offenses,
property offenders made up the largest proportion of waived cases, as
shown in table 4.  This was due to the prevalence of property
offenses versus person or drug offenses.  For example, NCJJ data
showed that in 1992, referrals to juvenile court were about 401,000
or 54 percent for property offenses, about 165,000 or 22 percent for
person offenses, and 46,000 or 6 percent for drug offenses.

Also shown in table 4, the offense profile of judicially waived cases
changed from 1988 to 1992.  For example, person offenses increased
from 29 percent of the cases waived in 1988 to 34 percent in 1992. 
In addition, property offense cases decreased from 53 percent of the
cases waived in 1988 to 45 percent in 1992. 

Similar to the offense profile, the demographic profile of juvenile
cases waived to criminal court had changed slightly from 1988 to 1992
(see table 5).  For example, the percentage of waived cases for
juveniles age 16 or older decreased from 93 percent in 1988 to 88
percent in 1992.  Also, the racial makeup of juveniles whose cases
were waived changed since 1988 when about 54 percent were white, 43
percent were black, and 2 percent were of other races.  In 1992,
about 47 percent of juveniles whose cases were waived were white, 50
percent were black, and 3 percent were of other races.

\10 We used juvenile court data collected annually by NCJJ to
determine the number of juvenile cases processed in criminal court
due to judicial waiver.  Each year, NCJJ collects juvenile court
processing data from various states and jurisdictions and assigns
weights to the data, which permits projecting the data to produce
national estimates of cases disposed by all state juvenile justice
systems. 


      ANALYSIS OF WAIVER RATES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.3

To provide perspective on patterns of waiver rates across the six
states, we examined data on the number of juveniles charged with
violent, property, and drug offenses.  We used these three offenses
because the number of cases for each offense allowed comparisons. 
Our analysis focused on the potential effects on waiver rates for
five variables--age (for six states), sex (for six states), race (for
six states), nature of locality (metropolitan or nonmetropolitan, for
four states), and number of prior referrals (for five states).\11 We
examined each of the variables separately because we could not
control for variables for which data were not available and because
of the small number of cases waived in each offense type within the
state.  (Tables II.3, II.6, II.9, II.12, II.15, and II.18 contain the
data used in our analysis.)


--------------------
\11 The states differed because of the availability of data.  Utah
did not have a sufficient number of cases to be included in this
analysis.  For the other six NCJJ states, all were included for age,
sex, and race; Florida, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina
had data for metropolitan/nonmetropolitan locality; and Arizona,
Florida, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina had information
on prior referrals. 


         VARIABLES
-------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.3.1

Age - In the six states we examined, juveniles 16 years or older were
more likely to have their cases waived for all three offense types. 

Gender - Males were more likely than females to have their cases
waived within each offense type in the six states we analyzed.  The
extent of the difference again varied by state. 

Race - Blacks were more likely than whites to have their cases waived
for all three offenses in four of the six states we examined. 

Locality - In the four NCJJ states with data on type of court
location, some small differences existed but were not consistent
across offense types within the same state. 

Prior Referrals - In the five states we examined, waiver rates
generally increased with the number of prior referrals for all five
states and most offense types. 

Appendix II contains data on the percent of cases waived, the
demographic characteristics for juveniles in the seven states, and a
detailed discussion of our analysis of waiver rates. 


      JUDICIAL WAIVER CRITERIA
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.4

Whether a juvenile case is eligible for judicial waiver depends on
the state.  Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia have
judicial waiver laws, and each state establishes different criteria
for which cases may be waived.  The criteria often include specific
age and offense restrictions as well as factors that the judge must
consider related to the juvenile's case.  For example, juvenile
judges in Florida can waive a case to criminal court involving a
juvenile age 14 or older for any offense if there is a finding that
the juvenile should be transferred after considering certain factors;
whereas judges in Maryland can waive a case involving a juvenile age
15 or older for any offense and a juvenile of any age charged with a
crime punishable by death or life imprisonment if there is a finding
that the juvenile is unfit for juvenile rehabilitative measures.  In
addition, the U.S.  Supreme Court in an appendix to Kent v.  United
States, 383 U.S.  541 (1966),\12 outlined certain factors that the
juvenile court judge would consider when making waiver decisions
under the specific statute.  The factors from the 1966 court case
included

  seriousness of the alleged offense to the community and whether the
     protection of the community requires waiver;

  whether the offense was committed in an aggressive, violent,
     premeditated, or willful manner;

  whether the offense was committed against persons or against
     property, with greater weight being given to offenses against
     persons, especially if personal injury resulted;

  prosecutive merit of the complaint;

  whether the juveniles' associates in the offenses were adults;

  sophistication and maturity of the juvenile;

  juveniles' record and previous history;

  protection of the public; and

  likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile by the use
     of procedures, services, and facilities that are available to
     the juvenile court. 

Many states have incorporated these factors into their juvenile codes
either verbatim or with minor modifications.  In interviews with
judges in seven states and in our nationwide survey of prosecutors,
we asked which factors from a list (based on factors previously
listed) they were most likely to consider when making waiver
decisions.  The factors chosen most often by judges and prosecutors
were the seriousness of the offense, the juveniles' previous record
and history, and whether the juvenile was amenable to rehabilitation. 

While we were unable to get an estimate of the total number of waiver
petitions filed by prosecutors, information collected in our survey
of prosecutors suggested that more than half of the requests for
judicial waivers filed in calendar year 1993 were granted.\13 We are
not certain of the reliability of these figures because their
responses may have been on the basis of impressions rather than data. 
See appendix II for additional data on judicial waivers in the seven
states. 


--------------------
\12 The U.S.  Supreme Court in Kent also set forth a number of
procedural safeguards to protect the interests of the child--the
right to a hearing that meets the essentials of due process and fair
treatment, representation by counsel, access by the juvenile's
attorney to the juvenile's social record, and a statement of reasons
in support of the waiver order if the juvenile case is waived. 

\13 See appendix I for survey responses and confidence intervals. 


      LIMITED DATA INDICATED THE
      USE OF PROSECUTOR DIRECT
      FILING VARIES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.5

State data and data for only some counties were available in the
District of Columbia and 10 states that allow prosecutor direct
filing.  Table 6 shows the available data that we obtained on
prosecutor direct filings, including statewide data from five states
and the District of Columbia.  Data on direct filing in the other
five states were available only from certain counties.

Source:  Developed by GAO using data provided by state and local
court officials in jurisdiction listed. 

While the data provided by state and local court officials were
inconsistent and incomplete, (e.g., lack of statewide data and time
periods were different) they indicated that the frequency of using
direct filing varied throughout the states that have direct filing
laws.  Data provided by juvenile court officials on the number of
delinquency cases filed in these jurisdictions compared with data
provided by criminal court officials on the number of cases directly
filed by prosecutors showed that direct filing cases represented a
larger percentage of juvenile cases in some states than in others. 
For example, in Florida and Arkansas prosecutor direct filing cases
represented about 10 percent of juveniles cases, and in Colorado and
Wayne County, Michigan they represented about 1 percent. 

Direct filing laws in 10 states and the District of Columbia
generally focused on felony offenses for juveniles over an age
specified in each state's laws.  However, juveniles age 16 in
Nebraska and Vermont and age 17 in Wyoming can be direct filed in
criminal court for any offense.  In jurisdictions with direct filing
laws, prosecutors had discretion to decide whether to file the case
in juvenile or criminal court.  The extent to which prosecutors
exercise their discretion was exemplified by data provided by
criminal court officials in Arkansas and Wayne County, Michigan. 
These data showed that many of the cases eligible for direct filing
remained in juvenile court.  For example, in Arkansas 2,756 cases
were eligible to be filed in criminal court in 1992.  However, during
that period, prosecutors directly filed about 45 percent of the cases
in criminal court.  In addition, in Wayne County 146 juvenile cases
were eligible to be filed in criminal court in 1992.  However, during
that period less than half the cases, 61 (or 42 percent), were filed
in criminal court. 


      FREQUENCY OF JUVENILE CASES
      STATUTORILY EXCLUDED FROM
      JUVENILE COURT UNKNOWN
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.6

Data were not available on the number of cases excluded by law from
juvenile court jurisdiction.\14 Without state data, we were unable to
determine the frequency of statutory exclusion cases sent to criminal
court.  We were, however, able to analyze the laws to determine the
conditions under which juveniles were excluded from juvenile court
(see table 7 for our analysis).  According to our analysis, statutory
exclusion laws focused primarily on juveniles charged with serious
violent offenses and/or juveniles with previous juvenile or criminal
court records.  In addition, 15 states also excluded one or more
other serious offense (e.g., a child age 16 or older carrying a
handgun without a license in Indiana). 

In 17 of the 37 states with statutory exclusion laws, the laws
excluded juveniles charged with serious violent offenses and
juveniles with prior court records (repeat offenders) from juvenile
court.  For example, in Pennsylvania, any juvenile charged with
murder is excluded from juvenile court as well as any juvenile who
has been previously found guilty in a criminal proceeding.  In 13 of
the 37 states, the focus of the statutory exclusion laws are to
exclude juveniles charged with serious violent offenses from juvenile
court.  For example, in New York, any juvenile age 13 or older
charged with murder in the second degree is to be prosecuted in
criminal court.  In addition, New York excludes juveniles age 14 or
older from juvenile court for a list of serious violent crimes that
include assault, rape, and manslaughter, each in the first degree. 
New York does not have any exclusion provisions on the basis of the
juvenile's prior record.  In 7 of the 37 states and in the District
of Columbia, the focus of the statutory exclusion laws is to exclude
juveniles with prior criminal court records from juvenile court
jurisdiction.  These laws apply to all juveniles with specified prior
records (i.e., adult court convictions) regardless of their offenses. 
For example, in Virginia, any juvenile previously convicted as an
adult is excluded from juvenile court jurisdiction regardless of the
offense.\15

While statutory exclusion laws in most states focus on serious
violent offenses and prior records, in 15 states one or more other
serious offenses such as burglary, weapons, and drug offenses are
excluded.  For example, in Maryland using, wearing, carrying, or
transporting a firearm during a drug trafficking offense would
exclude a juvenile age 16 or older from juvenile court jurisdiction.

Note:  While statutory exclusion laws generally focus on juveniles
with serious violent offenses and/or prior court records, 15 states
also exclude juveniles with one or more serious offenses from
juvenile court jurisdiction.  These states are Alabama, Alaska,
Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Maryland, Mississippi, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and
Vermont.

--------------------
\14 Using 1990 data, NCJJ estimates that in 11 states where the
maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction is age 15 or 16,
approximately 176,000 cases involving persons age 16 and 17 are
automatically charged in criminal court each year because they are
defined as adults by the state.  However, there is no estimate on the
number of juveniles at or below the maximum age of juvenile court
jurisdiction that are charged in criminal court due to their offense
and/or prior record. 

\15 For those juveniles who were previously convicted and served
their sentences in facilities, the likelihood would be small that
they would still be under the maximum age of jurisdiction if they
were subsequently charged with another crime. 


      CHANGES IN STATE LAWS MAY
      AFFECT THE NUMBER OF
      JUVENILES SENT TO CRIMINAL
      COURT AND THE METHOD FOR
      SENDING CERTAIN JUVENILES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.7

Since 1978, 44 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws
that have an effect on which juveniles may be sent to criminal court. 
These laws could affect the number of juveniles sent to criminal
court; however, the impact may vary.  In 24 of these states and the
District of Columbia, the laws have tended to increase the population
of juveniles potentially subject to being sent to criminal court.  In
three states, the population of juveniles subject to being sent to
criminal court decreased.  In 17 states, the laws changed the method
in which certain juveniles are sent to criminal court. 

In 24 states\16 and the District of Columbia the laws that identify
juveniles who may be sent to criminal court increased the population
of juveniles potentially subject to being sent to criminal court. 
For example, in 1978, California law allowed juvenile court judges to
waive the case of any juvenile age 16 or older.  Since then, a law
was passed that allows juvenile court judges to also waive cases
involving juveniles 14 or older for a list of specific offenses. 
This change increased the number of juveniles that are subject to
being sent to criminal court.  Also, in 1978, North Dakota law
allowed judges to waive the case of a juvenile age 16 years or older
charged with a &quot;crime or public offense.&quot; Since then, a new law was
passed that allows juvenile court judges to also waive cases
involving juveniles 14 years or older charged with committing an act
that involves the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm.  New
Mexico, South Dakota, and Wyoming changed their laws, which had the
effect of decreasing the population of juveniles potentially subject
to being sent to criminal court.  For example, in 1978, Wyoming law
allowed judges to waive the case of a child of any age for any
offense to criminal court.  Currently, only cases involving children
age 13 or older can be waived to criminal court. 

In the remaining 17 states,\17 the new laws changed the method in
which certain juvenile cases may be sent to criminal court but did
not increase the size of the potential population of juveniles that
may be sent to criminal court.  In general, these laws have changed
the process for sending juveniles to criminal court.  For example, in
1988, Michigan passed a law that gives prosecutors the discretion to
directly file cases in criminal court involving juveniles who are age
15 or older and are charged with a list of specific crimes.  Prior to
this law, these cases would be filed initially in juvenile court, and
the prosecutors would have to request a waiver hearing for those
cases they believed should be sent to criminal court.  During the
waiver hearing, the juvenile court judge would decide whether to
waive the case to criminal court. 

Maryland also changed the process by excluding from juvenile court
juveniles age 16 or older charged with certain specified violent
crimes and other serious crimes.  Previously, the juvenile court
judge decided whether these cases should be sent to criminal court;
however, state law now establishes the criteria by which certain
juvenile cases are sent to criminal court. 


--------------------
\16 The states that have passed laws that increased the population of
juveniles who may be sent to criminal court are Alabama, Arkansas,
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, North
Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. 

\17 The states that have passed laws that changed the method in which
certain juveniles may be sent to criminal court are Alaska, Colorado,
Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah,
and Washington. 


      PROSECUTOR SURVEY INDICATED
      JUDICIAL WAIVER USED MOST
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.8

We surveyed a sample of prosecutors' offices to obtain information on
the estimated percent of all indictments filed against juveniles in
criminal court that were the result of judicial waiver, direct
filings, and statutory exclusions.  The survey results suggested that
in most prosecutorial offices, judicial waivers accounted for a
higher percentage of juveniles arriving in criminal court than direct
filings or statutory exclusions.\18 Further, we estimated that in
about 60 percent of the offices only judicial waivers were used. 
However, the results are difficult to interpret because of missing
data and potentially inconsistent completion by the respondents.

   JUVENILES PROSECUTED IN
   CRIMINAL COURT FOR CERTAIN
   OFFENSES TENDED TO BE CONVICTED
   AND INCARCERATED
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

Our analysis of 1989 and 1990 criminal court data for seven states
indicated that most juveniles prosecuted in criminal court in each
state were convicted.  Further, most juveniles were convicted of
property offenses.  When juveniles were sentenced in criminal court
for serious offenses, most were incarcerated. 


      MOST JUVENILES PROSECUTED
      FOR SERIOUS OFFENSES IN
      CRIMINAL COURT WERE
      CONVICTED IN SIX OF SEVEN
      STATES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1

Our analysis of conviction rates in seven states--California,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Pennsylvania, and
Vermont--showed that states conviction rates for juveniles prosecuted
in criminal court, during 1989 and 1990 combined, varied for serious
violent, serious property, and drug offenses.\19 For example, as
shown in table 8, the conviction rate for serious violent offenses in
Missouri was 50 percent.  Conviction rates for serious property
offenses in Pennsylvania and Vermont were 63 percent and 97 percent,
respectively.

Note:  This table includes the most prevalent offense types for which
juveniles are prosecuted, on the basis of criminal court data. 

Source:  Developed by GAO from OBTS data. 

To provide some perspective on how juveniles were treated as compared
with others prosecuted in criminal court, we compared juvenile
conviction rates with the conviction rates of &quot;other youth&quot;\20 age 16
or 17 and young adults ages 18 to 24 (see tables III.1 and III.2 in
app.  III for conviction rates for other youth and young adults). 
The data for other youth and young adults includes a broader range of
crimes within crime types (than juveniles' crimes) because all youth
and young adults crimes are prosecuted in criminal court.  Some
juvenile crimes are tried in criminal court because of the severity
of juveniles' offenses or prior records.  Our analysis of the two
states, Missouri and New York, which included the other youth
population,\21 showed that in Missouri, juvenile conviction rates
were higher than the rates of other youth (persons of age 17).  For
example, the conviction rate for juveniles prosecuted for serious
property offenses in Missouri was 67 percent compared with 38 percent
for other youth.  In New York, conviction rates were lower for
juveniles than they were for other youth (persons age 16 and 17). 
For example, the conviction rate for juveniles prosecuted in New York
for serious property offenses was 26 percent compared with 64 percent
for other youth. 

A comparison of conviction rates in the states we analyzed for
juveniles and young adults (persons age 18 through 24) showed that
generally, juveniles were, for some offenses, as likely as young
adults to be convicted in criminal court.  Finally, juvenile
conviction rates for serious violent, serious property, and drug
offenses were generally similar to the rates for young adults in the
states we analyzed, except for New York.  For example, the conviction
rate for serious property offenses in Minnesota was 97 percent for
juveniles compared with 89 percent for young adults.  Also, the
conviction rate for drug offenses in Pennsylvania was 83 percent for
juveniles compared with 81 percent for young adults. 

Our analysis of juvenile conviction offenses showed, in five\22

of seven states, that property offenses made up the largest
proportion of juvenile convictions in criminal court, representing
between 36 and 66 percent of convictions, as shown in table 9.  In
California and New York, violent offenses accounted for the largest
proportion of juvenile convictions.

Similar to juveniles, the largest percentage of other youth and young
adults convicted in criminal court were property offenders.  (See
tables III.3 and III.4 in app.  III for conviction offenses of other
youth and young adults.) In California and New York, the largest
proportion of young adults convicted were drug offenders.  For
example, 37 percent of young adults in California and 33 percent in
New York were convicted of drug offenses. 


--------------------
\19 Using OBTS data, we categorized offense types into serious
violent, serious property, and drugs.  Serious violent offenses
include murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, and other violent offenses (e.g., sexual assault and
kidnapping).  Serious property offenses include burglary, fraud,
forgery, embezzlement, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson.  Drug
offenses include drug possession and trafficking. 

\20 &quot;Other youth&quot; are individuals beyond the maximum age of juvenile
court jurisdiction in their state and are below the age 18. 

\21 Unlike the other five states where the maximum age of juvenile
court jurisdiction is 17, in Missouri, the maximum age is 16, and in
New York it is 15.  Therefore, in Missouri other youth are
individuals of age 17, and in New York, other youth are individuals
of age 16 and 17.  In both states, these other youths are legally
considered as adults and are under the original jurisdiction of the
criminal court. 

\22 The five states where property offenses made up the largest
proportion of juvenile convictions in criminal court were Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. 


      MOST JUVENILES SENTENCED IN
      CRIMINAL COURT FOR SERIOUS
      OFFENSES WERE INCARCERATED
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.2

In four\23 of seven states we analyzed, over half of the juveniles
sentenced in criminal court for serious violent, serious property, or
drug offenses were incarcerated in each state.  Incarceration
rates\24 for these offenses varied among states, as shown in table
10.  In Vermont, incarceration rates for these offenses were 33
percent or less.  In addition, in Missouri the incarceration rate for
drug offenders was 43 percent.  Also, in Pennsylvania the
incarceration rate for serious property offenders was 10 percent. 

Among the 7 states, a total of 703 juveniles was sentenced to
incarceration in the 3 offense types during 1989 and 1990.

To determine whether juveniles were incarcerated at rates similar to
others in criminal court, we compared juvenile sentences with those
of other youth and young adults.  (See tables III.5 and III.6 in app. 
III for incarceration rates for other youth and young adults.) In the
two states with an &quot;other youth population,&quot; Missouri and New York,
juvenile incarceration rates for serious violent and serious property
offenses were higher than incarceration rates for these offenses for
other youth.  For example, in Missouri, 80 percent of juveniles
sentenced were incarcerated for serious violent offenses compared
with 60 percent of other youth.  The juvenile incarceration rates for
drug offenses were lower than the rates for other youth in Missouri
and about equal to the rates for other youth in New York. 

Finally, we found no consistent pattern when comparing juvenile and
young adult incarceration rates (see table III.6 in app.  III).  For
some offenses juvenile incarceration rates were higher than young
adult incarceration rates, while for other offenses juvenile rates
were lower.  For example, in New York, the incarceration rate for
drug offenses was lower for juveniles, 62 percent, compared with 80
percent for young adults.  In contrast, in Nebraska, the
incarceration rates for serious violent offenses were higher for
juveniles, 93 percent, compared with 78 percent for young adults. 

In the seven states, the proportion of juveniles incarcerated for
serious property offenses was the same as the proportion incarcerated
for serious violent offenses but varied among the states.  Drug
offenders made up a smaller proportion of the total number of
juveniles incarcerated (see table 11).  In contrast, drug offenders
made up the largest proportion of other youth and young adults
incarcerated.  (See tables III.7 and III.8 in app.  III for the total
number of other youth and young adults incarcerated.)

While most juveniles sentenced in criminal court were incarcerated,
some juveniles also received probation and other sentences in the
seven states we analyzed.  In fact, in five of the states, some
juveniles convicted of serious violent offenses received probation
sentences.  As shown in table 12, the percentages varied from 3
percent in California to 50 percent in Vermont.

Additionally, juveniles convicted of serious property or drug
offenses in four states received probation at higher rates than
juveniles convicted of serious violent offenses.  Overall, while
juveniles convicted of serious violent, serious property, and drug
offenses generally did not receive fines as their sentences, in two
states, a significant percentage of these juveniles were sentenced to
pay fines.  In Pennsylvania, 84 percent of juveniles convicted of
serious property offenses were fined, and in Vermont, 33 percent of
juveniles convicted of drug offenses were fined. 

According to the literature, criminal court judges consider the
severity of the offenses and the prior offense history of the
juvenile in making their sentencing decisions.  However, data
limitations precluded us from considering the prior offense history
in our analysis. 


   PROBATION WAS THE MOST COMMON
   DISPOSITION BY JUVENILE COURT
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6

Our analysis of NCJJ data showed that probation was the most widely
used disposition in the juvenile court.  In 1992, in about 43 percent
of approximately 744,000 formal delinquency cases,\25

juveniles were placed on probation.  In addition, probation was the
most common disposition for all offense types.  A probation
disposition involves the court monitoring the juvenile's behavior,
helping the juvenile find a job, arranging in-home or out-of-home
care, or promoting wholesome leisure time activities.  Of the 57
percent of juveniles not placed on probation in 1992, about 27
percent of their cases were dismissed, 12 percent received some other
disposition, and 17 percent received placement (e.g., were placed in
a residential treatment program), as shown in table 13.  Finally, the
distribution of formal dispositions was similar during the 5-year
period, 1988 through 1992.

As shown in table 14, in 1992, formal cases received various
dispositions at similar rates for each offense type.  For example,
regardless of the offense, about 40 percent of juveniles were placed
on probation.

While probation was the most common disposition for formal cases, 47
percent of informal juvenile cases were dismissed in 1992,\26

as shown in table 15.  Of the remaining 53 percent of the cases,
about 30 percent of the juveniles were placed on probation, 23
percent received some other disposition, and 0.4 percent were placed
in a residential treatment program.  Finally, as with formal cases,
the distribution of informal dispositions was similar during the
5-year period, 1988 through 1992, as shown in table 15.  Of the
approximately 730,000 informal delinquency cases disposed of in 1992,
about 47 percent were dismissed.

For each offense type the distribution of informal dispositions was
similar.  For example, regardless of the offense, in about 30 percent
of informal cases, juveniles were placed on probation in 1992. 


--------------------
\25 Of the nearly 1.5 million delinquency cases filed in 1992, about
half (743,673) were handled through a formal process. 

\26 Possible reasons for dismissal included lack of evidence, offense
was petty or seen as low risk, or the juvenile and his or her family
had reimbursed the victim for damages. 


   THE FEW JUVENILES IN ADULT
   PRISONS WE VISITED WERE SUBJECT
   TO THE SAME POLICIES AND
   PROCEDURES AS ADULTS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7

A 1991 survey\27 of inmates in state correctional facilities reported
that less than 1 percent of state inmates were age 17 or younger. 
Few juveniles were incarcerated in the seven adult facilities we
visited.  Further, those juveniles were generally to be treated the
same as the adult prisoners. 


--------------------
\27 This survey was conducted by the U.S.  Bureau of the Census for
the U.S.  Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics. 


      JUVENILES IN ADULT PRISONS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.1

We could not find national estimates for the number of inmates at or
below the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction in each state. 

However, results of the 1991 Survey of Inmates in State Correctional
Facilities indicated that less than 1 percent of the 712,000 state
prison inmates were age 17 or younger.\28 In addition, during visits
to seven prisons in four states, we found that juveniles represented
a small number of the inmate population, at the time of our visit. 
For example, as shown in table 16, 31 of the 857 inmates at the
Western Youth Institution were age 17 or younger.  While these data
indicate that few juveniles were in the adult prison system at one
time, it does not include the number of inmates who committed their
offenses as juveniles and were sentenced to incarceration but are now
beyond the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction, as defined by
the state.

      JUVENILES ARE TO BE TREATED
      SAME AS ADULTS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.2

According to prison officials at all of the locations we visited,
juveniles convicted in criminal court and sentenced to prison are
considered adults.  Generally, they are subject to the same polices
and procedures as other inmates regarding housing, health care
services, education, vocation and work programs, and recreational
activities.  In addition, they are to be afforded the same mail,
visitation, and telephone privileges.  However, some prison officials
pointed out that juveniles and youthful offenders received different
treatment at some facilities (e.g., they were provided with a menu
designed for their nutritional needs and they received more
educational opportunities).  See appendix V for a summary of the
confinement conditions for juveniles in seven adult correctional
facilities.

We are sending copies of this report to the Attorney General; the
Administrator, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention;
the Director, Office of Management and Budget; and other interested
parties.  Copies will also be made available to others upon request.

OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY
=========================================================== Appendix I

The 1992 reauthorization (P.L.  102-586) of the Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (P.L.  93-415) mandated that we
study the processing of juveniles in criminal court.  Specifically,
we agreed with your Committees to

  provide the frequency to which juveniles have been sent to criminal
     court by judicial waiver, prosecutor direct filing, and
     statutory exclusion;

  analyze juvenile conviction rates and sentences of juveniles
     prosecuted in criminal court using the most current data;

  analyze the dispositions of juveniles in juvenile court; and

  analyze the conditions of confinement in adult correctional
     facilities for juveniles convicted in criminal court. 

We also agreed to summarize state laws governing the circumstances
under which juveniles can be sent to criminal court.  Further, we
noted the number of states that allowed criminal court judges to
transfer juvenile cases back to criminal court and the number of
states that allowed criminal court judges to impose juvenile court
sanctions. 

To address all objectives, we reviewed relevant literature.  To
determine the frequency to which juveniles are processed in criminal
court, we obtained national, state, and local court data.  Because
data were not available on the frequency of statutory exclusion, we
analyzed the statutory exclusion laws of 37 states and the District
of Columbia to determine the types of cases being excluded from
juvenile court.  To determine sentences of juveniles convicted in
criminal court, we analyzed conviction rates, conviction offenses,
and incarceration rates and sentences for juveniles prosecuted in
criminal court.  To determine the dispositions of juveniles in
juvenile court, we analyzed the offenses and dispositions of
juveniles in juvenile court.  To analyze conditions of confinement
for juveniles in adult correctional facilities, we conducted site
visits at seven adult prisons in four states.  We classified cases as
juveniles on the basis of the defendants' age at the time of arrest
because data were not available for the defendants' age at the time
of the offense.  As a result, we underestimated the number of
juveniles in criminal court.  To provide a summary of the state laws,
we reviewed the statutes for 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
Finally, we obtained additional perspectives on juvenile justice
issues by mailing a survey to a national sample of prosecutors'
offices and interviewing 15 juvenile court judges in 7 states. 

The act required us to compare the sentences of juveniles tried in
criminal court with those processed in juvenile court for similar
offenses.  On the basis of discussions with juvenile justice
officials, this type of comparison should recognize the selection
process by which juveniles are sent to criminal court or remain in
juvenile court.  The officials said that juveniles sent to criminal
court are a select subset of all juveniles.  The fact that they are
selected for criminal court indicates they are different from
juveniles processed in juvenile court.  When sending juveniles to
criminal court, decisionmakers (e.g., judges) generally consider that
these juveniles have (1) relatively more serious criminal behaviors,
(2) more extensive criminal histories, (3) less amenability to
treatment, or (4) a greater likelihood of being a threat to the
community than juveniles who are processed in juvenile court.  Also,
juveniles processed in criminal court are subject to a different
sentencing process than those in juvenile court.  Both factors mean
that comparisons between the two groups of juveniles would be of
nonequivalent groups.  As a result, differences or similarities in
their sentences would be difficult to interpret.  However, subject to
these caveats, we provided data on the sentencing outcomes for
juveniles processed in these two courts.  We could not determine the
extent to which sentencing outcomes were due to differences in
individual characteristics of juveniles in the respective courts or
sentencing processes of the courts. 


   REVIEW OF RELEVANT LITERATURE
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1

To develop an understanding of the issues associated with processing
juveniles in criminal court, we reviewed relevant literature
identified in bibliographies provided by the National Center for
Juvenile Justice (NCJJ) and the Department of Justice's Office of
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP).  From our review
of the literature, we determined the three principal methods for
sending juveniles to criminal court and identified the states'
policies on housing juveniles in adult prisons. 


   NATIONAL DATA ON THE FREQUENCY
   OF JUDICIAL WAIVER
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2

We used juvenile court data collected annually by NCJJ to determine
the number of juvenile cases processed in criminal court due to
judicial waiver.  Each year, NCJJ collects juvenile court processing
data and assigns weights to the data, which permits projecting the
data to produce national estimates of cases disposed by all state
juvenile justice systems.\1 OJJDP publishes the weighted data in its
annual Juvenile Court Statistics. 

Using the National Juvenile Court Data Archive (NJCDA), we developed
statistics for a 5-year period from calendar year 1988 to 1992. 
Specifically, we developed national estimates of the number of
juvenile cases waived to criminal court by juvenile court judges
(judicial waiver).  In addition, we developed statistics on the
offense profiles and demographics of juveniles, whose cases were
waived to criminal court. 


--------------------
\1 In 1991, for example, the following 23 states provided juvenile
court case-level data to NCJJ:  Alabama, Arizona (Maricopa county
only), Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New
York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  In 1990 and 1991,
California reported data from several of its larger counties,
representing 40 percent of the state's population that is age 17 or
younger.  In addition, some jurisdictions in seven other states
reported court case-level data that were used in generating the
national estimates.  In all, data from 1,504 jurisdictions covering
57 percent of the nation's youth at risk were used to produce the
1991 national estimates.  NCJJ's estimates of the number and
characteristics of delinquency cases and cases that were waived by
juvenile courts were on the bases of the assumption that the
characteristics of cases in counties that did not report juvenile
court statistics were similar to those counties of similar size that
did report statistics to NCJJ.  The details of the estimation
procedures can be found in Juvenile Court Statistics.  The national
estimates were not generated by a probability sample.  NCJJ has
conducted, however, tests of the validity of the national estimates
by comparing them with counts of referrals (as reported by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports) made by law
enforcement agencies to juvenile courts. 


   ANALYSES OF THE FREQUENCY OF
   JUDICIAL WAIVER IN SELECTED
   STATES
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3

NCJJ's NJCDA national data files did not contain sufficient
information for analyzing judicial waivers directly.  However, some
of the Center's state-specific files\2 have a wider range of data
elements (including prior offense histories) that facilitate such
analyses.  For example, in addition to data showing the types of
offenses and whether cases were waived, some variables that we
analyzed were the number of previous referrals and/or adjudications
and the metropolitan status of the court.  Thus, in order to conduct
more detailed analyses of judicial waiver, we judgmentally selected
the following 7 states from a total of 25 states that provided court
data to NCJJ:  Arizona, California, Florida, Missouri, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina, and Utah.  In addition to geographical coverage,
other factors we considered in selecting these seven states were that
(1) collectively, these states' juvenile justice systems reflected a
diverse range of processes for handling youthful offenders and (2)
the states' data files contained a sufficient number of variables
relevant to our analyses of judicial waiver. 

For each of the seven states selected, we obtained a copy of NCJJ's
computerized data files for calendar years 1990 and 1991, the most
recent years for which consistent data were available.\3 Then, using
the 1990 and 1991 data files, we completed analyses that compared the
waiver rates in different states; the waiver rates for defendants of
different genders, races, and ages; and the waiver rates of cases
processed in juvenile courts with different metropolitan status. 


--------------------
\2 We used data that were housed in and made available by the NJCDA,
which is maintained by NCJJ and supported by a grant from OJJDP. 
These data were originally collected by the Maricopa County, AZ,
Juvenile Court Center; the Alameda County, CA, Probation Department;
the Los Angeles County, CA, Probation Department; the San Francisco
County, CA, Juvenile Probation Department; the San Joaquin County,
CA, Probation Department; the County of Ventura, CA, Corrections
Services Agency; the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services; the Missouri State Division of Children and Youth Services;
the Pennsylvania Center for Juvenile Justice Training and Research;
the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice; and the Utah
Juvenile Court.  Neither the original data collectors nor NCJJ bear
any responsibility for our analyses or interpretations of the data. 

\3 For trend purposes, additional data files (i.e., for years before
1990) would have been desirable; however, the 1990-1991 data files
were the only years that had a sufficient range of variables common
to all seven states to facilitate our planned analyses. 


   STATE AND LOCAL DATA AVAILABLE
   ON THE FREQUENCY OF PROSECUTOR
   DIRECT FILING CASES
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4

To obtain data on the frequency of juvenile cases directly filed in
criminal court at the discretion of prosecutors, we contacted State
Court Administrator Offices in the 10 states with direct filing laws. 
Statewide data on prosecutor direct filing cases were available in 5
of the 10 states that have direct filing laws.  To obtain data for
the other states, we contacted some of the largest counties/parishes
in those states to get some measure of the frequency of prosecutor
direct filing.  We also contacted court officials in the District of
Columbia to determine the frequency of direct filing in the District. 


   ANALYSIS OF STATUTORY EXCLUSION
   STATUTES IN 37 STATES AND THE
   DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5

To gain some perspective on the type of juvenile cases processed in
criminal court due to state statutes that exclude them from juvenile
court, we analyzed the statutes in 37 states and the District of
Columbia.  We categorized the states according to whether their
statutory exclusion laws focused on (1) juveniles charged with
serious violent offenses or other serious offenses or (2) juveniles
with prior court records. 


   NATIONAL DATA ON THE NUMBER OF
   JUVENILE CASES SENT TO CRIMINAL
   COURT FOR ALL METHODS
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6

In an attempt to collect data on the number of juveniles sent to
criminal court by all possible methods, we developed a survey to be
completed by juvenile justice specialists in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia.  We received responses from 19 states and the
District of Columbia.  Nine of the responses indicated that the data
we requested were not available.  Due to the low response rate and
unavailability of data, we were only able to use this survey as an
indicator of the relative frequency in which juveniles are sent to
criminal court by the three methods.  In following up with
nonrespondents by telephone calls, they said that the data we
requested were not available. 


   STATE SPECIFIC ANALYSIS OF
   SENTENCES OF JUVENILES
   PROSECUTED IN CRIMINAL COURT
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7

To identify the types of sentences juveniles receive when processed
in criminal court, we used the Bureau of Justice Statistics's (BJS)
Offender Based Transaction Statistics (OBTS) data sets.\4 OBTS
focuses on arrested, alleged offenders and contains information on
offender characteristics, patterns of arrest, prior criminal
activities, prosecution activities, court action, and sentences.  At
the time of our review, OBTS contained data for the years 1975
through 1990 for approximately 15 states.  We analyzed data from
California, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Pennsylvania,
and Vermont for 1989 and 1990 combined.  We chose these states
because they represented different maximum ages of juvenile court
jurisdictions, different laws governing which juveniles may be sent
to criminal court, and different geographic regions.  We used these
data to analyze conviction rates, offenses, and incarceration rates
of juveniles prosecuted in criminal court.  In addition, we compared
these rates with those of &quot;other youth&quot; and young adults (persons age
18 through 24) to gain a perspective on how juveniles are treated
relative to others prosecuted in criminal court. 


--------------------
\4 We attempted to use the BJS National Judicial Reporting Program
(NJRP) data set.  NJRP is a data set that contains information on the
sentences of convicted felons received in state courts in 1988 and
1990.  The data set contains a probability sample of convicted felons
sentenced in state courts.  Because of missing data that identified
the age of the convicted felons, we could not identify juveniles and
therefore could not use this data to analyze juvenile sentences in
criminal court. 


   PROSECUTOR SURVEY
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8

To gather prosecutors opinions on data related to the processsing of
juveniles in criminal court, we obtained 226 completed questionnaires
from a nationally representative, probability sample of district
prosecutor offices that deal with juveniles in juvenile courts.  Our
final sample was identified by first contacting a stratified
probability sample of county prosecutors in 290 of the 3,110 counties
in the United States.  To gather information about both large and
small counties, the sample was stratified on the basis of the number
of felony convictions in 1985.  The 1985 felony convictions were used
first to draw this sample of 290 counties in 1986 for the National
Judicial Reporting Program. 

We developed and pretested the questionnaire items with advice from
experts at NCJJ and BJS as well as selected prosecutor offices.  The
survey was mailed in March 1994.  Two sets of follow-up telephone
calls and two additional mailings were conducted between May and
July. 

We contacted all 290 selected counties to determine whether they had
juvenile prosecutors and, if so, the counties over which they had
jurisdiction.  We determined that 270 of the 290 counties were
eligible members of our study population of prosecutor offices that
dealt with juvenile offenders in juvenile court.  After weighing on
the basis of the probabilities of selection, we estimated that the
study population consisted of approximately 2,118 such juvenile
prosecutors in the United States.  The number of juvenile prosecutors
(2,118) is less than the number of counties (3,110) partly because
some counties are consolidated under a single juvenile prosecutor and
partly because some jurisdictions do not have prosecutors that appear
in juvenile court.  Of the 270 sampled prosecutors from the study
population, 226 responded, for a response rate of 84 percent. 

All figures presented in this report were estimated from the returned
questionnaires to the population of the estimated 2,118 juvenile
prosecutor offices.  All sample surveys are subject to sampling
error, which refers to the extent to which the results may differ
from what would have been obtained if the entire population had been
surveyed.  The size of sampling errors in any survey depends largely
on the number of respondents and the amount of variability in the
data from the returned surveys.  In this report, all estimates are
made at the 95-percent confidence level with a sampling error of less
than 10 percent.  This means that, if we had drawn repeated samples
from the entire study population of prosecutor offices, 19 out of 20
samples would have produced estimates within 10 percent of the true
proportion in the total population. 

In addition to the reported sampling errors, any survey may be
subject to nonsampling errors as well.  For example, differences in
how a particular question is interpreted, in the sources of
information that are available to respondents, or in the types of
people who do not respond, can introduce unwanted variability into
survey results. 

We included steps in the data collection and data analysis stages to
minimize such nonsampling errors.  We selected the sample from a
complete list of all counties, and we pretested our questionnaire
with experts and members of the target population.  Our extensive
follow-up efforts were designed to maximize the response rate, and we
achieved a final response rate of 84 percent.  All data were keyed
twice and verified during data entry, and all computer analyses were
reviewed by a second independent analyst. 


   NATIONAL DATA ON THE
   DISPOSITIONS OF JUVENILE COURT
   CASES
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9

To develop national statistics on the types of dispositions used in
juvenile court, we used the NCJJ's NJCDA data files.  We developed
national estimates to compare (1) the number of juvenile cases
processed informally versus formally, (2) the dispositions of cases
handled formally versus informally, and (3) the types of dispositions
for various crime types. 


   SITE VISITS TO REVIEW
   CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT FOR
   JUVENILES IN ADULT PRISONS
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:10

To obtain descriptive information on the conditions of confinement
for juveniles in adult prisons, we visited seven prisons in Florida,
Michigan, North Carolina, and Ohio.  In judgmentally selecting states
to visit, we considered (1) the state's maximum age of juvenile court
jurisdiction in each state, (2) whether juveniles were housed with
younger inmates (e.g., inmates under 25) or inmates of all ages, and
(3) the number of inmates under the age of 18. 

In each state, we visited the prisons that housed the majority of
inmates under age 18.  We visited a total of seven prisons--six that
housed males and one that housed females.  During our visits, we
interviewed prison officials, using a structured interview format. 
While we did not verify the information provided, we toured the
facilities to observe the housing units, health services facilities,
education and vocation classrooms, and recreation facilities. 


   JUDGES SURVEY ADDRESSING
   JUDICIAL WAIVER ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:11

We conducted structured interviews with 15 juvenile court judges in 7
states to obtain information on methods for sending juveniles to
criminal court.  Judges were chosen randomly and interviewed on the
basis of their availability.  We attempted to contact two or three
judges in the juvenile court jurisdictions that we visited during our
site visits. 


   PROSECUTOR SURVEY AND THEIR
   RESPONSES

   DETAILS OF ANALYSIS OF WAIVER
   RATES
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8

We did the following analysis using the data from tables II.3, II.6,
II.9, II.12, II.15, and II.18.  However, our analysis was limited to
the variables for which data were available in the six states.\1

Age - In the six states we examined, juveniles age 16 or older were
more likely to have their cases waived than juveniles under age 16
years for all three offense types.  However, the likelihood that
older juveniles would have their cases waived than younger juveniles
was much larger in some states than in others.  For example, in
Arizona older juveniles charged with property offenses were 39 times
more likely to have their cases waived than were younger juveniles
charged with such offenses; while in Florida, older juveniles charged
with property offenses were only 5 times more likely to have their
cases waived than younger juveniles.  While waiver rates were
somewhat higher in four of the six states for violent offenses than
for property or drug offenses, the rates varied among the states
within each age category.  For example, older juveniles charged with
property offenses were 44 times more likely to have their cases
waived in Missouri than in California, while younger juveniles
charged with violent offenses were 58 times more likely to have their
cases waived in Missouri than in California. 

Gender - Males were more likely than females to have their cases
waived within each offense type in the six states we analyzed.  The
extent of the likelihood again varied by state.  For example, in
Arizona males charged with violent offenses were 42 times more likely
to have their cases waived than females in Arizona, while such males
were 17 times more likely to have their cases waived than females in
California.  In some states, the likelihood was more apparent for
those charged with violent offenses than for those charged with
either property or drug offenses.  For males, juveniles charged with
violent offenses had higher waiver rates than for males charged with
drugs or property offenses in three of the six states.  In the
remaining three states, males charged with drug offenses had higher
waiver rates.  Waiver rates for each offense type also differed
across states for males.  For example, males charged with property
offenses in Arizona or Missouri were 18 times more likely to have
their cases waived than males in California. 

Race - In four states, blacks were more likely than whites to have
their cases waived for violent, property, and drug offenses.  For
violent offenses, the differential rates are fairly consistent across
states, with black juveniles having waiver rates from 1.8 times to
3.1 times higher than whites.  The differences varied more widely for
drug offenses.  In California, black juveniles were half as likely as
white juveniles to have their cases waived, while in Pennsylvania
black juveniles were more than twice as likely to have their cases
waived than whites.  There were some large differences, however; for
example, for juveniles charged with drug offenses, Arizona's waiver
rates for whites were twice those of California; while for blacks,
Arizona's rates were 55 times those of California. 

Locality - In the four NCJJ states with data on metropolitan and
nonmetropolitan courts, some small differences did exist but were not
consistent across offense types within the same state.  For example,
in Missouri, waiver rates in metropolitan areas were higher for
violent and drug offenses but lower for property offenses than in
nonmetropolitan areas.  The waiver rate was highest for drug offenses
in all four states in nonmetropolitan areas and in three of the four
states in metropolitan areas.  In nonmetropolitan areas in
Pennsylvania, juveniles charged with violent offenses were less
likely to have their cases waived than those charged with drugs or
property offenses.  The likelihood of cases being waived in each type
of locality varied somewhat for the offense types among the four
states, particularly for property offenses.  For example, juveniles
charged with property offenses in metropolitan areas in Pennsylvania
were almost 4 times more likely to have their cases waived than were
juveniles in South Carolina, while those charged with property
offenses in nonmetropolitan areas of Pennsylvania were 9 times more
likely to have their cases waived than those in South Carolina. 

Prior Referrals - In the five states with data, waiver rates
generally increased with the number of prior referrals for all five
states and most offense types.  We categorized referrals into three
groups:  (1) none, (2) one or two, and (3) three or more.  The larger
increases usually occurred between the second and third categories. 
For example, in Arizona, juveniles charged with violent offenses and
who had one or two prior referrals were 3 times more likely to have
their cases waived than those with no referrals, while juveniles
charged with violent offenses with three or more referrals were 8
times more likely to be referred than those with no referrals.  The
states differed in the rates at which they waived cases for these
offense types in each prior referral group.  The differences were
strongest for juveniles charged with property offenses.  For example,
considering only those with three or more prior referrals, the
greatest difference for juveniles charged with violent offenses was
found between Arizona and Florida, where Arizona's waiver rate for
these juveniles was 5 times greater than Florida's.  However, for
juveniles charged with property offenses, the greatest difference was
found between Pennsylvania and South Carolina, where Pennsylvania's
waiver rate was almost 10 times greater than in South Carolina.

                                 punishable by more than 6 months incarceration
                                 over which it has exclusive jurisdiction).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:  This analysis focused on the state laws that were passed
through 1994, some of which became effective in 1995.  Certain
violations committed by juveniles are treated as if they were done by
adults in many states; namely, fish and game violations, traffic
violations committed by juveniles old enough to obtain drivers
licenses, and contempt of court.  In addition, some states have
provisions that allow the juvenile to request that his or her case be
waived to criminal court or that provide for waiver or prosecutorial
discretion when the charges are violations of alcohol and tobacco
possession laws.  These types of provisions are not included in the
table. 

When a case is waived to criminal court because of the nature of the
charge, charges arising out of the same incident or which are
otherwise joinable are usually also transferred.  When waiver is in
the juvenile court's discretion, common prerequisites are that there
must be a waiver hearing where it is found that there is probable
cause that the child committed the act and that it is in the best
interests of the child and community that there be waiver of
jurisdiction. 

The category of statutory exclusion in the table includes state
statutory provisions that require that the juvenile be transferred to
criminal court from juvenile court (identified as &quot;mandatory
transfer&quot; provisions). 

\a An information is a written accusation made by a public
prosecutor.  It is used in place of a grand jury indictment to bring
a person to trial. 

\b Reverse waiver in New York--Juvenile Offenders (juveniles who
commit statutorily excluded offenses) originally appear before local
criminal court.  The criminal court may, at the request of the
prosecutor or the juvenile, remove the action to family court. 
However, if the juvenile is charged with second degree murder, first
degree rape, sodomy, or an armed felony, the criminal court may not
remove the case to family court, unless the criminal court finds one
of the following three factors:  (1) mitigating circumstances, (2)
that the juvenile's participation in the offense was minor, or (3)
possible deficiencies in proof. 

In addition, the grand jury may request removal to family court if it
finds that the juvenile committed a crime, the crime is one for which
the grand jury may not indict a juvenile (i.e., offenses other than
those listed in the statutory exclusions), the grand jury does not
indict, and there is legally sufficient evidence that the child
committed a crime.  The court must approve the request unless it is
improper or insufficient on its face. 

After the juvenile is arraigned upon an indictment in Superior Court,
the Superior Court may, upon motion of any party or its own motion,
order removal to family court.  However, if the juvenile is charged
with one of the above enumerated offenses the Superior Court must
obtain the prosecutor's consent and find one of the above listed
factors in order to remove to family court.

SUMMARY OF CONFINEMENT CONDITIONS
FOR JUVENILES IN ADULT
CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES
=========================================================== Appendix V

The following data regarding the conditions of confinement of
juveniles in seven adult correctional facilities that we visited was
provided by facility officials without our verification. 


   HOUSING
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:1

In Ohio, juveniles were housed within the general prison population
irrespective of their age.\1 However, in Florida, Michigan, and North
Carolina, younger inmates (typically those under age 26) were usually
housed in prisons designated for that age group.  At six of the
prisons we visited, age was not considered when making housing
assignments within the prison.\2

Housing units in the prisons we visited varied in layout from single-
or double-bunk cells to dormitory style structures.  Housing units
typically had common-use bathroom facilities.  In addition, most
housing units' common-use areas typically were equipped with
televisions. 


--------------------
\1 According to a deputy warden at Southeastern Correctional
Institution in Ohio, the prison formerly accepted many of Ohio's
young offenders (age 21 and below).  However, due to problems
associated with violence among young offenders, they will now be sent
to other prisons, and older inmates are being integrated into the
Institution. 

\2 The Florida Correctional Institution is a women's prison that
housed inmates of all ages. 


   HEALTH SERVICES
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:2

At all seven prisons, health care was available on site.  Generally,
the health staff was composed of a physician, nurses, and a dentist. 
Upon entering the prison system, all inmates were to be subjected to
a physical examination.  Inmates were to be allowed daily visits to
the health unit.  When an inmate requested to see a nurse, generally
the request was to be granted within 24 hours.  If an emergency
occurred, the inmates' care was to be handled at the prison or at an
off-site hospital.  Additionally, the facilities usually were to
provide mental health counseling and offer some form of drug
rehabilitation.  For example, in Florida, new inmates were to be
screened to determine if they needed substance abuse services. 
Substance abuse services available in Florida prisons included
treatment ranging from a 40-hour educational program to a 6- to
12-month intensive program. 


   EDUCATION, VOCATION, AND WORK
   PROGRAMS
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:3

Education, vocation, and work programs were available at all prisons
we visited.  During classification, inmates were generally to be
given an opportunity to indicate their preferences for participation
in these programs.  Factors to be considered by prison officials when
assigning inmates to these programs included inmates' length of
sentence, educational level, and security classification. 

In six of the seven prisons, generally all inmates were to
participate in an education, vocation, or work program.\3

Education programs available at the prisons included classes dealing
with the Graduate Equivalency Diploma (GED) test and adult basic
education.  Class sizes generally ranged from about 15 to 30 inmates. 
However, at the Handlon Michigan Training Unit, an adult basic
education program had much smaller class sizes, which sometimes had a
teacher to inmate ratio of 1 to 1 for inmates testing below the eight
grade reading and math level. 

All of the prisons offered a variety of vocational programs.  These
programs included auto mechanics, masonry, electronics, horticulture,
and drafting.  The Florida Correctional Institution for women offered
vocational programs in data entry, sewing, and cosmetology.  Some
factors considered when assigning inmates to vocational and education
programs included their custody classification and educational level. 
Also, because some programs took as long as 16 months to complete,
inmates with sentences shorter than the length of the program were
not eligible to participate. 

Inmates not participating in education or vocational programs were to
be required to work.  Job assignments included cooks, dishwashers, or
food servers in the prison kitchen, lawn maintenance on the prison
grounds, or work at the prison store.  In Ohio, Michigan, and North
Carolina inmates were paid a nominal salary to work or attend school. 
For example, in Ohio, inmates could earn up to $20 per month.  In
addition, inmates at the Florida Correctional Institution,
Southeastern Correctional Institution, and the Michigan Reformatory
could participate in prison industry programs that produced products,
some of which were marketed outside of the prisons.  For example, at
the Michigan Reformatory, the Michigan State Industries employed
about 90 inmates in an on site furniture factory. 


--------------------
\3 At the Michigan Reformatory, a maximum security prison, inmates
were not required but had the option to work or attend school. 


   RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:4

All prisons provided a variety of recreational activities and
equipment.  During leisure time inmates generally had access to a
library, television, weight-lifting equipment, table tennis, and pool
tables.  One prison provided cable programming on a large screen
television, and another prison provided a built-in swimming pool
(which inmates paid for) and a tennis court.  Several of the prisons
had intermural sports, including flag football, basketball, and
softball. 


   DAILY SCHEDULE
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix V:5

Inmates at the prisons we visited had similar daily schedules. 
Generally, they began the day between 6:00 a.m.  and 8:00 a.m. 
Typically the inmates were counted about four times daily.  Following
the morning count, breakfast was served.  After breakfast, inmates
reported to their school or work assignments for about 3 hours. 
Lunch was usually served around 12:00 p.m.  After lunch, inmates
returned to their school or work assignments for another 3 hours. 
Dinner was served around 5:00 p.m.  After dinner, inmates had time to
participate in various recreational and religious programs or other
activities from about 6:00 p.m.  until about 9:00 p.m.  Inmates were
locked in their housing units with lights out at about 11:00 p.m.

<font size="2">(Letter Report, 06/19/95, GAO/GGD-95-139).
<img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">

Pursuant to a legislative requirement, GAO reviewed juveniles' access to
counsel in state and local juvenile delinquency proceedings, focusing
on: (1) juveniles' right to counsel under 15 states' laws; (2) the
frequency with which juveniles have counsel in juvenile courts in 3
states; (3) the likely impact of counsel on juvenile justice outcomes;
(4) juveniles' access to counsel in adult courts; and (5) the quality of
counsel juveniles receive.

GAO found that: (1) the 15 states reviewed had laws guaranteeing
juveniles' right to counsel in delinquency proceedings which included
provisions for indigent juveniles; (2) 11 states specified the
circumstances under which juveniles could waive their right to counsel
and in 3 states, juveniles could waive their right to counsel although
statutes did not specifically provide for such waivers; (3) juvenile
representation rates varied between 97 percent to 65 percent and between
metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas; (4) the impact of counsel on
case outcomes varied by the state and offense, but in 2 states,
juveniles without representation were less likely to receive out-of-home
placements; (5) differences in case outcomes between represented and
nonrepresented juveniles were due more to other variables than to
juveniles' representation status; (6) although there was no existing
data on juveniles' access to counsel in adult courts, state laws provide
for such representation; and (7) prosecutors and juvenile justice
officials were generally satisfied with the quality of counsel juvenile
offenders received and believed that public defenders were at least as
capable as private attorneys, although they had excessive caseloads and
limited resources.

The 1992 reauthorization (P.L.  102-586) of the Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (P.L.  93-415) mandated that we
study access to counsel in state and local juvenile delinquency
proceedings.  Some legal organizations and scholars had raised
concern about the access to counsel afforded to juveniles in juvenile
court proceedings.  For example, the American Bar Association; the
Consortium of Children, Families and the Law; and individual law
professors testified in September 1992 to Congress that half of all
juveniles in the United States waive their constitutionally
guaranteed right to counsel without speaking to an attorney. 

To meet our legislative requirements, we agreed with your committees
to

  review state laws for 15 states that we selected to determine
     juveniles' right to counsel,

  determine the frequency with which juveniles have counsel in
     juvenile courts in three states,

  determine the likely impact of counsel on juvenile justice
     outcomes,

  determine if juveniles who are in adult court have counsel, and

  develop insights regarding the quality of counsel. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

Statutes guaranteeing juveniles' right to counsel in delinquency
proceedings were present in the 15 states whose laws we examined. 
For juveniles who could not provide counsel on their own, the states
had provisions to provide and compensate counsel for them.  Of the 15
states, 11 had laws allowing the waiver of counsel under certain
circumstances but generally had rules to ensure that waivers were
made only when juveniles were aware of their right and voluntarily
gave up that right.  According to officials in three other states,
juveniles can waive counsel even though the state statutes do not
specifically address the waiver issue.  In the remaining state,
juveniles could not waive counsel. 

We could find no national data regarding juveniles' representation by
counsel.  However, the National Center for Juvenile Justice (NCJJ)\1
had such data for some jurisdictions, and we analyzed its data for
available counties in California, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska for
portions of 1990 and 1991.  The results only relate to the
jurisdictions for which we were able to obtain data and therefore
cannot be generalized to other jurisdictions within these states. 
Throughout this report, our references to the states apply only to
the counties in the states for which we have data. 

  Overall representation rates varied widely, from about 97 and about
     91 percent, respectively, in California and Pennsylvania to
     about 65 percent in Nebraska, and within the states the rates
     varied between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.\2

  Representation rates by offense category (e.g., violent crimes,
     property crimes, drug crimes, etc.) varied, with minimal
     variation in California and Pennsylvania (about 83 to almost 100
     percent) across all categories and a wider variation across
     categories in Nebraska (about 54 to 91 percent); however, 76
     percent of all unrepresented cases in Nebraska were for less
     serious property offenses. 

Overall impact of representation on case outcomes varied according to
the state and the offense category.  Sometimes juveniles with
representation were more likely to have their cases adjudicated as
delinquent (i.e., judged to be a delinquent)\3 and sometimes those
without representation were more likely to be adjudicated as
delinquent.  In most cases, juveniles without representation were
less likely to receive out-of-home placements (e.g., training
school). 

According to our logistic regression\4 models for California,
Nebraska, and Pennsylvania, unrepresented juveniles were generally
about as likely to have their cases adjudicated than represented
juveniles, but characteristics other than representation (e.g.,
detention prior to adjudication and prior offense history) were more
strongly associated with the likelihood of adjudication. 

According to our models for placement outcomes for the three states,
juveniles' characteristics other than representation (e.g., detention
prior to adjudication or prior offense history) were more strongly
associated with placement decisions. 

We could not locate any databases to determine if juveniles in adult
court had counsel or to compare access to counsel for juveniles in
adult and juvenile court.  However, on the basis of our review of
criminal law, juveniles in adult court have the same right to counsel
as adults.  In addition, our survey of prosecutors indicated that
juveniles in adult and juvenile court were given the same opportunity
as adults to be represented.  (We could not determine the extent to
which juveniles waived their right to counsel in adult court.)

Prosecutors and juvenile justice officials in the eight local
jurisdictions we visited were generally favorable concerning the
quality of counsel provided to juveniles.  They also reported that
public defenders were seen to be at least as capable as private
attorneys in representing juveniles, and several officials noted that
public defenders were more knowledgeable in the laws and rules
governing juvenile proceedings.  However, these officials noted that
while public defenders had the most experience in juvenile law and
procedures, they also had very high caseloads.  These officials
raised concerns over the limited resources and growing caseloads of
public defenders.

methodology used when the dependent variable is qualitative, such as
if a juvenile is adjudicated as delinquent.  Regression analysis
identifies relationships between the dependent variable and two or
more key variables, such as the use of counsel and the juvenile
offender's current offense category and prior offense history and
supervisory status. 


   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

Juvenile justice is primarily the responsibility of state and local
authorities because juvenile courts derive their authority from state
legislatures.  The juvenile courts of all 50 states are part of their
states' judicial system but are generally county or city based and
vary in structure, policy, and procedure.  Thus, juvenile courts'
jurisdiction and procedures vary widely across and within states. 
Appendix I illustrates differences in profiles of the juvenile
justice processes in nine states.\5

      MAJOR ELEMENTS OF JUVENILE
      COURT PROCEDURE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1

When juveniles commit crimes, they are usually subject to the
jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a delinquent offender. 
Referrals of delinquents come to juvenile court from many sources,
including parents, police officers, victims, and schools.  Law
enforcement agencies provide the vast majority of referrals to
juvenile courts.  The Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) reported in 1991 that law
enforcement agencies referred 85 percent of all delinquency cases to
the courts. 

Referrals generally come to the court's intake department to be
screened by intake staff.\6 The intake staff examine the referral to
determine what type of crime is alleged to have been committed and
how to proceed with the handling of the referral.  The intake
decision process has several potential outcomes.  Among other things,
intake staff may decide to dismiss the case for insufficient legal
evidence or to resolve the matter informally out of court.\7 These
informal dispositions may include diverting the juvenile to a social
agency for services,\8

informal probation, or the payment of fines or some form of
restitution. 

If intake staff decide that the referral should be handled formally,
a petition is drafted and filed to provide notice of the issues that
will be adjudicated.  The petition charges the juvenile with a
delinquency offense violation and requests an adjudicatory or waiver
hearing.  In some states, petitions may be dismissed before the
actual adjudicatory hearing\9 is held for various reasons, such as
when the case is not viewed by court officials as a particularly
serious offense.  For example, in Pennsylvania, less serious
petitioned cases may be disposed of by consent decrees--informal
adjustments\10 without an adjudicatory hearing. 

At an adjudicatory hearing, the juvenile may have his or her case
adjudicated, i.e., judged as delinquent and, if so, the case proceeds
to a disposition hearing.\11 The judge is responsible for presiding
over the hearing, including determining placement of the juvenile
during the pending proceedings, making any interim orders that are
necessary to the conduct of the case, and deciding the disposition of
the case if there has been a finding of delinquency.  The range of
disposition options available to the juvenile court judge generally
includes (1) commitment to an institution; (2) placement in a group
home or other residential facility; (3) probation; (4) referral to an
outside agency or mental health program; or (5) imposition of a fine,
community service, or restitution order. 

A juvenile may be temporarily placed in a detention facility during
various stages of a case as it progresses through the juvenile
justice system.  Generally, juveniles alleged to be delinquent may be
placed in secure custody in a physically restrictive facility. 
Depending on the state's detention laws, the juvenile may be detained
to protect the community, the juvenile, or both.  In addition,
detention may be used to ensure the juvenile's appearance at a
hearing or while the juvenile is awaiting long-term placement in
another facility.  A judicial decision to detain or continue
detention may occur before or after adjudication or disposition. 
OJJDP estimated that in 1991 juveniles were held in detention
facilities between the time of referral and case disposition in about
20 percent of the 1.3 million delinquency cases.\12


--------------------
\6 We obtained the information in this section from various sources,
such as documents and discussions with juvenile justice officials. 

\7 Besides insufficient legal evidence, a referral may be dismissed
because (1) the offense is petty or seen as a low risk, (2) the
referral is a first offense, and the level of its seriousness does
not merit formal consideration, (3) the juvenile and his/her family
have reimbursed a victim for damages, (4) formal processing is seen
as unnecessary, (5) or because family strengths are prominent and the
juvenile is perceived to be responsive to parental controls and
discipline. 

\8 Diversion programs were designed to remove first-time offenders
and relatively minor offenders from the formal adjudication process. 
To meet the treatment needs of those juveniles, most of whom have not
faced previous juvenile court adjudication, a variety of
community-based programs and agencies have been created. 

\9 A hearing where a judge presides over a juvenile court proceeding
to determine if the juvenile actually committed the alleged offense. 

\10 The juvenile and the court agree to suspend the case with the
juvenile remaining at home under probation conditions for up to 6
months. 

\11 Juveniles can also be adjudicated as status offenders.  Juveniles
who have come in contact with the juvenile justice system by
committing an offense (such as running away or truancy) that would
not be a crime if committed by an adult are status offenders.  Our
review focused on delinquents and did not include status offenders. 
For more information on status offenders, see our report entitled
Noncriminal Juveniles:  Detentions Have Been Reduced but Better
Monitoring Is Needed (GAO/GGD-91-65, Apr.  24, 1991). 

\12 At the time of our review, 1991 was the most recent data
available. 


      ROLE OF COUNSEL IN JUVENILE
      COURT
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.2

Historically, juvenile delinquents subject to the jurisdiction of
juvenile court were not afforded the same constitutional rights
guaranteed to adult criminal defendants.  However, in 1967 the U.S. 
Supreme Court held that juvenile offenders were entitled to the
assistance of counsel in certain juvenile delinquency proceedings, In
re Gault, 387 U.S.  1 (1967).\13 In Gault, the Supreme Court
concluded that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
requires that in proceedings to determine delinquency (e.g.,
adjudication hearings) that may result in commitment to an
institution in which the juvenile's freedom is curtailed, the
juvenile and his or her parents must be notified of the juvenile's
right to be represented by counsel.  The Supreme Court also indicated
that if the juvenile and his or her parents could not afford counsel,
counsel must be appointed to represent the juvenile. 

With regard to the waiver of counsel, the Supreme Court indicated in
Gault that waiver must be an &quot;intentional relinquishment or
abandonment of a fully known right.&quot; The Supreme Court also stated
that the juvenile and his or her parents have a right expressly to be
advised that they may retain counsel.  If they are unable to afford
counsel, they are entitled, considering the seriousness of the charge
and the potential commitment, to be appointed counsel.  However, they
can choose to waive counsel. 

Currently, there are three major approaches to the provision of
defense counsel in juvenile courts: 

  public defenders, which include private attorneys or law firms
     under contract with or granted funds by a governmental entity to
     defend juveniles; private agencies, such as legal aid societies
     under similar contracts or grants; and government defender
     agencies;

  private attorneys appointed by the court to represent individual
     juveniles and paid from public funds; and

  privately paid attorneys. 


--------------------
\13 In an earlier case, the U.S.  Supreme Court indicated that a
juvenile was entitled to the assistance of counsel in a proceeding to
determine whether the juvenile's case should be waived to the
jurisdiction of the criminal court.  Kent v.  United States, 383 U.S. 
541, 561-62 (1966). 


   SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

To aid us in identifying the issues regarding access to counsel, we
reviewed relevant literature in bibliographies provided by NCJJ and
OJJDP.  We developed information on juveniles' rights and access to
counsel through a combination of methods, including (1) an analysis
of statutes, state administrative procedures, and case law in 15
states;\14 (2) an analysis of NCJJ statistical data on 3 states;\15
(3) nationwide surveys of county prosecutors and public defenders;
(4) telephone interviews with selected state and local judges in
Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Texas, and Utah; and (5) visits to four states--Florida, Louisiana,
Pennsylvania, and Utah--to meet with juvenile justice officials to
understand the processes and frequency of when counsel was provided. 

We completed our statistical analysis of NCJJ data in two parts. 
First, using seven general crime categories (see table 1.), we
developed statistics on case processing outcomes for certain counties
in California, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania for calendar years 1990 and
1991.\16 Specifically, we reported the percentages of juveniles
petitioned to court who received counsel.  Second, we computed and
analyzed the probabilities that juveniles with counsel and without
counsel were adjudicated or placed.  We analyzed these two decision
points because the Gault ruling focused on these key decisions in
which juveniles were at risk of losing their liberty. 

Juvenile facilities are not all the same.  For example, facilities
vary in degrees of security.  Data were not readily available to
differentiate between types of placement juveniles received or the
security of the facility.  Therefore, our analysis only recognized
that the juveniles were either placed or not placed.  Also, the data
identified represented and unrepresented juveniles who were
adjudicated as delinquents.  However, data were not readily available
to identify those who were represented but during the process had
their charges reduced (e.g., from aggravated to simple assault). 
Therefore, our analysis of the data may not recognize the impact of
being represented in terms of impact on reduction in charges. 



                           Table 1
           
                  Crime Categories and Types

Crime categories    Crime types
------------------  ----------------------------------------
Violent crimes      Murder and nonnegiligent manslaughter;
                    rape; robbery; aggravated assault; other
                    violent crimes, which include negligent
                    manslaughter, sexual assault,
                    kidnapping, and others but excludes
                    simple assault; and indeterminate
                    violent offenses (i.e., the crime was a
                    violent crime, but the type of violent
                    crime was not known).

Property crimes     Burglary, fraud, forgery, and
                    embezzlement; larceny; motor vehicle
                    theft; unspecified larceny; other
                    property (e.g., trespassing and
                    vandalism); indeterminate property
                    (i.e., the crime was a property offense,
                    but the type of property offense was not
                    known).

Simple assault      Generally an attack without a weapon
                    resulting in minor injury.

Drug crimes         Possession, trafficking, and other or
                    unspecified drug crime.

Weapons             Unlawful sale, manufacture,
                    transportation, distribution, or
                    possession.

Public order or     Disorderly conduct, escape, obstruction
nonviolent crimes   of justice, and other public order
                    crimes (e.g., prostitution).

Indeterminate       Crime type not known.
------------------------------------------------------------
Note:  Definitions of crime types included in the six broader crime
categories may vary across states.  Further, certain specific crime
types are excluded from juvenile court jurisdiction in some states,
e.g., murder in Pennsylvania. 

Source:  Derived from Uniform Crime Report crime classifications,
NCJJ offense categories, and state definitions of crimes. 

Because case characteristics, in addition to representation, may
affect case outcomes, we developed logistic regression models to
control for these characteristics.  We looked at the relationships
between the type of counsel (i.e., public defender, court-appointed
attorney, or private attorney) in juvenile delinquency proceedings
and key decision points--adjudicated and placed--in the juvenile
judicial process controlling for a number of relevant variables.  We
estimated the models separately for the 3 states for up to 10 crime
types yielding 24 adjudication and 24 placement models. 

The variables we controlled for in our logistic regression models
measured three types of case characteristics:  (1) demographic
variables, such as age, race, and gender; (2) offense-related
variables, such as current crime type, the severity of the current
crime type, and offense history; and (3) juvenile court-status
variables, such as detention prior to adjudication; source of
referral; informal adjustments prior to adjudication; representation
by counsel and the type of counsel representing the case, location of
the courts, and length of time to dispose of a case.  See appendix
III for a discussion on how we classified crime types and the
variables used in the models. 

Also, to better understand the underlying processes, we developed
profiles of the juvenile justice systems in nine states.  We
coordinated our work with OJJDP, NCJJ, the American Bar Association,
the National Legal Aid Defenders' Association, and the Coalition for
Juvenile Justice.  Appendix II provides a more detailed discussion of
our objectives, scope, and methodology, including the basis that we
used to select states and identify officials.  The details of the
modeling procedures as well as of the results are discussed in
appendix III. 

The data we developed, including the results of our interviews with
juvenile justice officials, are not projectable to other locations. 
We did our work from March 1993 through November 1994 in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Since no
federal agency has responsibility for the issues discussed in this
report, we did not obtain comments on a draft of this report. 
However, we did discuss our results with NCJJ and OJJDP officials
and, where appropriate, incorporated their comments. 


--------------------
\14 Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland,
Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina, Utah, and Texas. 

\15 The three states are California, Pennsylvania and Nebraska.  The
statistical data for all three states were somewhat limited. 
California's data only included five counties, albeit five of the
largest counties in the state that represented 40 percent of the
state's juvenile population between ages 10 and 17.  Pennsylvania's
data were for 1991 only and did not include Philadelphia county, the
most heavily populated county in the state.  Philadelphia county
accounted for about one-third of all petitioned cases in
Pennsylvania; however, Philadelphia petitions all cases to juvenile
court.  In the other counties, petitioned cases are limited to the
more serious ones.  Therefore, Philadelphia's data are not comparable
with the rest of the counties.  In Nebraska, one of the largest
counties' data did not consistently indicate whether juveniles had
representation at the adjudication hearing.  However a state official
estimated that about 75 percent of juveniles in this county had
representation when they appeared before a judge at an adjudication
hearing. 

\16 In considering the relative severity of crimes, we considered
classes of crimes, such as violent or property, rather than specific
types of crimes within a class or specific offense behaviors within a
type of crime.  Therefore, we considered violent crimes as the most
serious class of crimes, followed by property crimes, drug crimes,
simple assault, weapons, and public order.  Because we could not
determine what classes of crimes fell into the indeterminate
category, we did not consider it in the ranking of offense severity. 


   JUVENILES' RIGHT TO COUNSEL CAN
   BE WAIVED IN MOST STATES WE
   REVIEWED
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

To determine juveniles' right to counsel, including the process that
juveniles can use to waive their right to counsel and the provision
of counsel for indigent juveniles, we reviewed the statutes, case
law, and state administrative rules of the court in 15 states.\17
(See app.  IV for a table summarizing the state laws.) We found that
each of the 15 states had provisions that provide juveniles charged
with delinquent offenses the right to counsel.  Further, most of the
states permitted juveniles, or their parents or guardians, to waive
their right to counsel under certain circumstances. 


--------------------
\17 Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland,
Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina, Texas, and Utah. 


      JUVENILES' ACCESS TO COUNSEL
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1

Each of the states had provisions that provided juveniles access to
counsel.  However, the 15 states differed on details of how counsel
is to be provided.\18 See appendix IV for additional information on
juveniles' access to counsel. 


--------------------
\18 These provisions go beyond the specific requirements of the Gault
decision, which only dealt with a juvenile's right to counsel at an
adjudication hearing. 


      JUVENILES' RIGHT TO WAIVE
      COUNSEL
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.2

Eleven of the 15 state statutes that we reviewed specifically
outlined circumstances and procedures under which juveniles or their
parents or guardians could waive the right to counsel.  In general,
the waiver had to be knowing and voluntary, i.e., an &quot;intentional
relinquishment or abandonment of a fully known right.&quot; In the four
remaining state statutes, waiver was not specifically addressed.  In
three of these four states, juveniles can waive counsel.  In the
remaining state, juveniles cannot waive counsel. 

Eleven states had specific requirements for how the waiver of counsel
was to occur.  For example, in Arizona, the waiver had to be in
writing or in the minutes of the courts and could be withdrawn at
anytime.  In Florida, even if there is a waiver of counsel, the offer
of counsel must be renewed at subsequent stages during the
proceedings.  In Idaho, a juvenile may waive counsel if he or she
does so &quot;intelligently,&quot; and the court determines that the best
interest of the juvenile does not require the appointment of counsel. 
In Louisiana, the juvenile may waive counsel only after consulting
with an attorney or other adult interested in the juvenile's welfare. 
In Missouri, a juvenile may waive counsel only with the approval of
the court.  In Pennsylvania, only the juvenile's parent or guardian
can waive the right to counsel on behalf of the juvenile.  New York
and Texas only allow waiver under certain circumstances.  In New
York, a juvenile can waive counsel only after a law guardian has been
appointed and the court holds a hearing.  In Texas, a juvenile cannot
waive counsel at certain proceedings, such as an adjudication hearing
or a disposition hearing. 

In four states, the statues did not address waiver.  In Kansas, the
statute does not specifically address waiver, but a recent state
Attorney General opinion concluded that juveniles can waive their
right to counsel if it is a &quot;knowing and intelligent waiver.&quot; In Utah
and Nebraska, the state law was silent on waiver of counsel by
juveniles.  However, Utah and Nebraska officials told us that
juveniles are allowed to waive counsel in these states.  In New
Mexico, the state statute requires that juveniles be represented at
all stages of the proceedings.  State officials told us that
juveniles are not given the option of waiving counsel. 


   REPRESENTATION RATES VARIED IN
   THREE STATES MORE WITH
   GEOGRAPHY THAN WITH OFFENSE
   SEVERITY OR OFFENSE HISTORY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

We analyzed cases petitioned to juvenile courts in certain
California, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska counties.  Our analysis showed
that the percentage of cases in which juveniles had counsel (1)
varied among the states, (2) varied with the location of the court
within states, and (3) varied somewhat across offense categories or
with offense history within the states. 


      REPRESENTATION RATES VARIED
      AMONG STATES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1

Table 2 shows, for the six major crime categories and the
indeterminable crime category, the number of petitioned delinquency
cases disposed of in 1990 and 1991 for California and Nebraska, and
in 1991 for Pennsylvania.  Using the data from table 2, we computed
the percentage of petitioned cases in which juveniles had counsel. 
Table 3 shows that the percentage of petitioned cases represented by
counsel varied among states.  In California, about 97 percent of the
juveniles were represented.  In Pennsylvania, juveniles were
represented in about 91 percent of the petitioned cases.  In
Nebraska, juveniles were represented in about 65 percent of the
petitioned cases.  In addition, table 3 shows that, for each major
crime category, the percentage of petitioned cases represented was
lowest in Nebraska.  For example, about 90 percent of juveniles in
Nebraska referred for violent offenses were represented, as compared
with almost 100 percent in California and 94 percent in Pennsylvania.

------------------------------------------------------------
Note:  Data were available for five counties in California, which
represented 40 percent of the juvenile population between ages 10 and
17.  According to an NCJJ official, the Pennsylvania data, which were
only for 1991, excluded cases from Philadelphia because Philadelphia
petitions all cases, not just the more serious cases, to juvenile
court.  According to a Nebraska official, data were not available on
representation rates in one of the state's larger counties.  We also
omitted these cases from our analysis.  However, he added that an
estimated 75 percent of the juveniles were represented at
adjudication hearings in that county.  These limitations apply to all
results using California, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska data.  Table 1
and appendix III provides information on the specific types of crimes
falling into each offense category in each state.  The figures in
this table were computed after excluding cases in which the type of
counsel was missing in the database.  In California, this amounted to
5 percent of 64,275 cases; in Pennsylvania 5 percent of the 15,397
cases; in Nebraska 18 percent of the 6,603 cases.

Our results were consistent with studies conducted by Barry C. 
Feld\19 and Dean J.  Champion,\20 which showed that the rates of
representation varied among states.  Feld analyzed the representation
rates in cases disposed of in juvenile court in 1984 for California,
New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota.  He
found that between 85 percent and 95 percent of juveniles were
represented in the large, urban states--Pennsylvania, California, and
New York.  By contrast, he found that between 37.5 percent and 52.7
percent of juveniles were represented in the midwestern
states--Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota. 

Champion analyzed juveniles' representation rates in California,
Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Montana, and Nebraska between 1980 and
1989.  He found wide variation in representation rates among the
states.  In California, the representation rates increased from 82
percent to 91 percent between 1980 and 1989.  Over the same period,
in Pennsylvania, the percentage represented increased from 55 percent
to 85 percent.  Conversely, in Nebraska and North Dakota, the
representation rates varied between 40 percent and 50 percent over
the 1980 to 1989 period. 

In another study which analyzed Missouri's juvenile justice system,
the authors found that youths in urban localities were more likely to
be represented by counsel, regardless of their race.  When
controlling for factors such as prior criminal history and
demographic characteristics, representation by counsel remained a
significant factor in predicting both detention and petition in rural
jurisdictions, and a significant factor in detention, petition, and
adjudication in urban jurisdictions.\21

We did not evaluate these studies, including any limitations they may
have.

      REPRESENTATION RATES VARIED
      WIDELY WITH LOCATION OF THE
      COURT WITHIN STATES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.2

While each of the three states guaranteed juveniles the right to
counsel and permitted them, their parents, or guardian to waive their
right, in practice juveniles were more likely to be unrepresented in
courts located in nonmetropolitan counties than in metropolitan
counties.\22 Table 4 shows the representation rates for Nebraska and
Pennsylvania by metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties.\23

Source:  Our analysis of NCJJ data. 

In Pennsylvania, about 13 percent of the 14,584 juvenile court
proceedings occurred in nonmetropolitan counties, but 26 percent of
the cases involving juveniles without counsel occurred in
nonmetropolitan counties.  In metropolitan counties, 8 percent of all
juveniles were unrepresented, as compared with about 19 percent who
were unrepresented in nonmetropolitan counties.  Therefore, juveniles
were more than twice as likely to go without representation in
nonmetropolitan counties as in metropolitan counties in Pennsylvania
(about 19 percent compared with 8 percent). 

In Nebraska, more than half of the 4,449 juvenile court proceedings
were disposed in nonmetropolitan counties.\24

However, about 85 percent of all unrepresented juveniles lived in
nonmetropolitan counties.  In metropolitan counties about 12 percent
of juveniles were unrepresented.  By contrast, in nonmetropolitan
counties about 55 percent of juveniles were unrepresented. 
Therefore, juveniles in nonmetropolitan counties were more than 4
times as likely to go unrepresented as those in metropolitan
counties. 

In California, our data for the 60,710 juvenile cases came from 5
metropolitan counties.  Nevertheless, two of the five counties
accounted for all of the unrepresented juveniles.  In the other three
counties, no juveniles were unrepresented.  In the two counties
containing the unrepresented juveniles, the percentage of juveniles
unrepresented was about 2 and 18. 

Our findings on the variability in representation rates across
nonmetropolitan and metropolitan court settings within states are
consistent with Feld's study of representation in juvenile cases
disposed in 1986 in Minnesota.\25 He found 63 percent of petitioned
juvenile cases in metropolitan counties were represented by counsel,
but only 25 percent of petitioned juvenile cases in nonmetropolitan
counties had representation.  He attributed these differences to the
procedural formality and due process orientation of metropolitan
courts as compared with the more traditional and informal processing
in nonmetropolitan courts. 


--------------------
\22 For this analysis, we classified counties located within
metropolitan statistical areas as &quot;metropolitan counties,&quot; and we
classified counties outside of metropolitan statistical areas as
&quot;nonmetropolitan counties.&quot; These distinctions correspond roughly to
(1) more densely populated or more urban and (2) less densely
populated or more rural locations. 

\23 NCJJ data from California contained only metropolitan counties. 

\24 These data exclude one metropolitan county that contained 56
percent of all unrepresented cases in the state of Nebraska.

      PROVISION OF COUNSEL TENDED
      NOT TO BE AFFECTED BY THE
      TYPE OF CRIME AND PRIOR
      OFFENSE HISTORY
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.3

The juvenile court data from California, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska
indicated that neither the type of offense nor juveniles' offense
history were strongly related to representation rates. 

In California and Pennsylvania, juveniles who committed certain
nonviolent offenses, such as property offenses, were generally as
likely to receive representation as juveniles who committed other
more serious offenses, such as violent crimes or drug trafficking. 
However, in Nebraska, juveniles who committed less serious crimes
(e.g., property and public order) were less likely to be represented
than those who committed more serious crimes (e.g., violent
offenses). 

As shown in table 3, in California, juveniles petitioned to the court
for violent offenses were about as likely to be represented (99.7
percent) as juveniles sent to the court for property offenses (98.8
percent).\26 In Pennsylvania, juveniles with violent and drug
offenses were only slightly more likely to be represented than
juveniles with public order offenses (94.0 and 96.4 percent to 86.2
percent).  In Nebraska, the juveniles' representation rates varied
across offense categories.  Juveniles with weapons, violent, and drug
offenses were more likely (90.6, 90.2, and 80.4 percent) than those
with property offenses (62.6 percent) to be represented.  In
Nebraska, juveniles with property offenses comprised about 71 percent
of all cases and 76 percent of all unrepresented cases.  For violent
offenses in Nebraska, 90 percent of the juveniles were represented. 

Offense history was not uniformly related to the likelihood of
representation between the states.\27 In Pennsylvania, across all
crime types, those with one or more prior juvenile court dispositions
were more likely to be represented than those with none.  The extent
of the difference in representation rates varied across crime type. 
For example, 94 percent of violent offenders in Pennsylvania with no
prior referrals were represented, and 98 percent of violent offenders
with one prior offense were represented.  For public order or other
nonviolent offenders in Pennsylvania, the difference in
representation rates for those with no prior offenses and those with
one prior offense was more dramatic.  Seventy-seven percent of the
public order offenders with no prior offenses were represented
compared with 93 percent of those with one prior offense.  In
Nebraska, however, there were no consistent patterns across crime
types, which may be due in part to the small number of cases with
multiple prior offenses.  For example, for property offenders in
Nebraska, representation was likely to be increased from 54 percent
(for offenders with no prior offenses) to 86 percent (for offenders
with three prior offenses) before decreasing to 78 percent for those
with five or more prior offenses. 


--------------------
\26 The results in this paragraph are based on our analysis of the
broad offense categories given in table 1.  We did a more refined
analysis of the more detailed offense types comprising these offense
categories.  For details on this analysis, see appendix III. 

\27 Offense history was measured differently across the states
because of the way they collected their data.  For example, in
Nebraska, offense history was measured by the number of prior
referrals to juvenile court.  In Pennsylvania, however, it was
measured by the number of prior juvenile court dispositions.  In
California, there was no direct measure of offense history, but
California did indicate whether a juvenile was under probation
supervision at the time of the commission of the current offense. 


   JUVENILE COURT OUTCOMES VARIED

293 cases that were transferred to criminal court.  These 293 cases
were excluded from the total number of cases having adjudication

transfer cases do not go to adjudication hearings.  All 293 transfer
cases were represented by legal counsel. 

\b The number includes 251 cases that were transferred to criminal

for California.  It also includes 1,868 cases that were disposed
without an adjudication hearing.  These 1,868 cases also were not
used in tabulating the adjudication outcomes. 

\c The numbers include three cases with missing values on the final

\d The number includes one case with missing values on the variable
indicating the outcome of the adjudication hearing. 

Source:  Our analysis of NCJJ data. 

In addition to these differences in the likelihood of being
adjudicated, overall relatively few adjudicated cases were
unrepresented in California and Pennsylvania.  Specifically, of the
41,985 cases adjudicated as delinquent in California, only 946 (or
2.3 percent) were unrepresented.  In Pennsylvania, only 305 of the
8,488 cases adjudicated as delinquent (or 3.6 percent) were
unrepresented.  Conversely, in Nebraska, 1,468 of the 3,861 cases
adjudicated as delinquent (about 38 percent) were unrepresented. 

The differences in the likelihoods of adjudication between
represented and unrepresented juveniles in California was associated
with the location of courts in which cases were heard and in
Pennsylvania with the use of informal adjustments after cases were
petitioned to the court.  The higher likelihood of adjudication for
unrepresented cases in Nebraska was associated with juvenile court
cases located in more rural counties. 

Our analysis of the placement decision showed that unrepresented
juveniles in Pennsylvania and Nebraska generally were less likely to
receive out-of-home placements than represented juveniles for each
offense category.  In California, the overall likelihood of placement
for unrepresented juveniles was higher than represented juveniles. 

Of the 21,899 juveniles placed in California, 644 (or 2.9 percent)
were unrepresented.  In Pennsylvania, 39 of the 2,213 juveniles that
were placed (or 1.8 percent) were unrepresented.  In Nebraska, 59 of
the 463 juveniles placed (or 12.7 percent) were unrepresented. 


--------------------
\28 Our review did not include all possible outcomes of juvenile
court proceedings, but focused only on the juvenile being adjudicated
as a delinquent and receiving out-of-home placement. 


      OVERALL LIKELIHOOD OF
      ADJUDICATION FOR JUVENILES
      WITHOUT COUNSEL VARIED AMONG
      STATES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :6.1

The overall likelihood of a case being adjudicated as delinquent when
a juvenile was not represented varied among states.  As shown in
table 6, these percentages ranged from 93 percent in Nebraska to
about 55 percent in California to about 31 percent in Pennsylvania. 
The differences in the likelihood of adjudication between
unrepresented and represented juveniles also varied among states. 
For example, unrepresented juveniles were less than one-half as
likely as represented juveniles in Pennsylvania to be adjudicated. 
In California, unrepresented juveniles were about 80 percent as
likely to be adjudicated as were represented juveniles.  (See tables
2 and 3 for the number of juveniles petitioned and the percentage of
juveniles who were petitioned and represented in each state.)

In California and Pennsylvania, comparatively small percentages of
all adjudications (less than 4 percent) involved juveniles that were
not represented.  In Nebraska, a relatively large percentage of all
adjudicated cases involved juveniles who were not represented (about
38 percent).  See table 5 for the number of juveniles who were
adjudicated and not represented.

Note:  See note to table 2. 

Source:  GAO analysis of NCJJ data. 

These aggregate differences in the likelihood of adjudication between
the two groups of juveniles (unrepresented and represented) tended to
be associated with the location of courts or with the use of informal
adjustments by the court to dispose of cases. 

In California, all of the unrepresented juveniles came from two of
the five counties from which we obtained data.\29 In one of these two
counties, the overall likelihood of adjudication was lower than in
counties where no juveniles were reported as unrepresented. 

In Pennsylvania, our analysis and discussion with a state official
indicated that the aggregate differences in the likelihood of
adjudication were due largely to the use of consent decrees to
dispose of unrepresented cases.  A disproportionate number of cases
involving unrepresented juveniles in Pennsylvania were disposed of by
a consent decree--an informal disposition in which the juvenile and
the court agree to suspend the case providing the juvenile remains at
home under probationary conditions for up to 6 months.  According to
a state official, counsel generally is not present or is waived
because juveniles have no risk of adjudication (or placement) if they
comply with conditions of the consent decree.  For Nebraska, our
analysis showed that a disproportionate number of cases involving
unrepresented juveniles were processed in nonmetropolitan counties,
and cases involving unrepresented juveniles processed in
nonmetropolitan counties also were more likely to be adjudicated as
delinquent than those processed in metropolitan counties.  Thus,
unrepresented juveniles in Nebraska were generally more likely to
have their cases adjudicated as delinquent in nonmetropolitan
counties. 


--------------------
\29 All five California counties were located in metropolitan areas. 


      UNREPRESENTED JUVENILES
      GENERALLY WERE LESS LIKELY
      TO BE PLACED THAN
      REPRESENTED JUVENILES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :6.2

As shown in table 7, unrepresented and adjudicated juveniles faced
different likelihoods of receiving out-of-home placements in the
three states.  California had the highest rate of out-of- home
placement for juveniles without counsel.  Pennsylvania and Nebraska
had lower rates of placement for these juveniles, although
unrepresented juveniles in Nebraska were less likely to be placed
than those in Pennsylvania.

Among states, the difference in the likelihood of placement between
represented and unrepresented juveniles varied.  In California, the
overall difference in placement between represented and unrepresented
juveniles was about 16 percent.  Between offense categories, the
differences ranged from about 1 to 26 percent--weapon offenses were
about 26 percent, drug offenses were about 5 percent, and
indeterminate offenses were about 1 percent.  In Pennsylvania and
Nebraska, the overall differences between these two groups were about
14 percent in Pennsylvania and 13 percent in Nebraska, and in these
two states the differences also varied. 

In California juveniles' overall likelihood of placement, represented
or unrepresented, was the highest of the three states at about 52
percent.  However, the likelihood that a juvenile would be
unrepresented and placed was about 3 percent.  In contrast, juveniles
in Nebraska had the lowest likelihood of placement--about 12 percent. 
However, the risk that a juvenile would be unrepresented and placed
was largest in Nebraska.  These differences were due to differences
in the representation rates.  In California, more than 97 percent of
juveniles were represented, and the chances that a placed juvenile
was unrepresented was comparatively small (about 3 percent). 
However, in Nebraska, about 35 percent of all cases were not
represented.  Thus, even though Nebraska placed a smaller fraction of
its juveniles than did California, the overall chances that a placed
juvenile did not have counsel was much higher (about 13 percent). 


   REGRESSION MODELS FOR THREE
   STATES SHOWED THAT VARIABLES
   OTHER THAN REPRESENTATION WERE
   STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH
   ADJUDICATION AND PLACEMENT
   OUTCOMES
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7

The differences in outcomes between groups of unrepresented and
represented juveniles were due more to variables other than the
presence of counsel.  To control for the variables that were
associated with the likelihood of adjudication or placement and which
might have been distributed unequally between these two groups of
juveniles, we estimated logistic regression models for adjudication
and placement.  (See app.  III for detailed discussion of our
approach.)

For both the adjudication and placement outcomes, we estimated models
for up to 10 specific crime types, e.g., rape, robbery, and larceny. 
We included in our regressions three classes of independent
variables:  (1) demographic variables, such as age, race, and gender;
(2) offense and offender-behavior variables, such as current offense,
offense history, supervisory status, and type of counsel; and (3)
court processing variables, such as length of time to disposition,
detention prior to adjudication, the location of the court, and the
type of representation.\30

Overall we estimated 24 adjudication models, 10 for California, 9 for
Pennsylvania, and 5 for Nebraska.  We also estimated 24 placement
models for the same sets of crime types in each state.  For the
adjudication models, we found that unrepresented juveniles generally
were about as likely as represented juveniles to have their cases
adjudicated as delinquents.  Also, although we found that the type of
counsel had effects on the likelihood of juveniles having their cases
adjudicated as delinquent, the effects were not consistent among
states or crime types.  In addition, our models showed that
variables, such as being securely detained prior to adjudication, the
juvenile's prior criminal history, and the location of the court,
tended to have the largest impacts on the likelihood of adjudication. 

For the placement models, we found that the absence of counsel was
not associated with the likelihood of placement for most crime types. 
However, there were exceptions to this general finding. 
Specifically, the absence of counsel reduced the likelihood that
juveniles were placed for some crimes in Pennsylvania and Nebraska
but not in California.  The type of counsel also influenced placement
outcomes for juveniles.  Finally, variables measuring the severity of
the juveniles' offenses and the offense history tended to have the
largest impacts on placement outcomes.

state's models and on all of the variables analyzed, see appendix
III. 


      ADJUDICATIONS ASSOCIATED
      WITH COURT SUPERVISION,
      LOCATION OF COURT, AND
      INFORMAL ADJUSTMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.1

The results of our modeling of the adjudication decision for the
three states showed that for some crime types the absence of counsel
had an independent effect on the likelihood of adjudication. 

The effects of the type of counsel--public defenders, court-
appointed attorneys, and privately paid attorneys--on the likelihood
of adjudication varied among crime types and states.  For example, in
California, juveniles represented by court- appointed attorneys were
more likely to be adjudicated than juveniles represented by the other
attorney types for property, weapons, drug, and minor violent (e.g.,
simple assault) offenses.  Conversely, they were less likely to be
adjudicated for serious violent crimes such as rape and aggravated
assault.  In Pennsylvania, juveniles who were represented by
privately paid attorneys were less likely to be adjudicated than
juveniles represented by other attorney types for aggravated assault
and larceny.  In Nebraska, juveniles who were represented by private
court-appointed attorneys were less likely to be adjudicated than
juveniles represented by other attorney types. 

The specific variables, other than the presence of counsel, that were
associated with the likelihood of adjudication varied, but there were
some similarities.  For example, in California, whether a juvenile
was under court supervision\31 at the time of the offense, the
location of the county in which the case was disposed, and whether
the juvenile was detained prior to adjudication tended to have larger
associations with the likelihood of adjudication, rather than whether
a juvenile was represented.  For example, juveniles who were detained
prior to adjudication were from 1.2 to 1.5 times more likely to be
adjudicated than juveniles not detained. 

In Pennsylvania, petitioned juveniles who had adjudicatory hearings
in a court in a metropolitan county and were detained prior to their
adjudicatory hearing increased their likelihood of being adjudicated
as delinquent.  However, the use of informal adjustments (i.e.,
consent decrees) to dispose of cases resulted in petitioned juveniles
not being adjudicated because they did not have adjudicatory
hearings. 

The models showed that unrepresented juveniles were generally as
likely as represented juveniles to have their case adjudicated.  For
some crimes and under some conditions, however, this was not always
the situation.  For example, unrepresented juveniles with burglary
and weapons offenses in California and Pennsylvania and unrepresented
juveniles with larceny offenses in Nebraska were less likely to have
their cases adjudicated.  In addition, in Nebraska juveniles in rural
areas, generally were less likely to have their cases adjudicated
than those in urban areas.  To find out possible reasons for these
results, we reviewed relevant literature and talked with an official
in Pennsylvania as well as officials representing the American Bar
Association, juvenile justice systems, and public defenders to obtain
their reactions to these findings.  The 1988 and 1991 studies by
Barry C.  Feld showed that juveniles may be less likely to have their
cases adjudicated in rural areas because judges in those areas may
have greater familiarity with the juveniles' cases and may handle
them less formally or are less likely to adjudicate them as
delinquent.  Consequently they may be less likely to appoint counsel. 

The officials whom we interviewed and our review of the literature
offered the following possible reasons why juveniles without counsel
were less likely to have their cases adjudicated: 

  The judges may be more likely to ensure that juveniles have counsel
     when they believe that a juvenile has a greater risk of
     receiving a severe disposition (e.g., placement). 

  The informality of juvenile court processing in some states may be
     a reason.  Juveniles without representation are
     disproportionately found in rural areas.  Judges in these areas
     may have greater familiarity with cases, and handle them less
     formally.  For example, for these cases, they may be less likely
     to appoint counsel. 

  Judges may be more lenient to juveniles already under supervision
     by the court and may be willing to continue their present
     sentence, rather than adjudicating for a new offense. 
     Recognizing this, the juveniles may decide to waive counsel. 

  The relationships between judges and attorneys may be a factor. 
     For example, some judges may have antagonistic relationships
     with attorneys.  The presence of attorneys, therefore, may
     result in more severe dispositions.  Judges may also be more
     protective of juveniles without counsel and, therefore, less
     likely to give them a severe disposition.

\31 The juvenile was being supervised as a ward of the court
immediately prior to the referral. 


      LIKELIHOOD OF PLACEMENT WAS
      STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH
      DETENTION AND PRIOR OFFENSE
      HISTORY
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :7.2

In our regression models, we analyzed variables that were associated
with placement outcomes.\32 The models indicated generally that (1)
whether the juvenile was detained prior to adjudication and (2) prior
offense history had a large impact on the likelihood of placement. 
In each state, across most crime types, juveniles detained prior to
adjudication were more likely to be placed than juveniles who were
not detained.  In general, detention prior to adjudication was viewed
as an indication of the severity of the offense, and juveniles who
were part of more severe cases were more likely to be placed. 
Therefore, the positive association between detention and the
likelihood of placement is not surprising. 

Similarly, juveniles' prior offense history or prior contact with the
juvenile justice system had strong and positive effects on the
likelihood of placement for most crime types for California and
Pennsylvania.  In California, juveniles who were under court
supervised probation for a previous offense when they committed their
current offense were from 2 to 8 times more likely to be placed (for
all crimes except rape and robbery) than juveniles who were not under
court supervision.  In Pennsylvania, juveniles with more than 3
priors were from 4 to 27 times more likely to be placed (for all
crimes except weapons) than juveniles with fewer than 3 priors. 

We also found that the types of representation influenced the
likelihood of placement.  For example, in California and Nebraska
juveniles who were represented by privately paid attorneys were less
likely to be placed than juveniles who were represented by other
attorney types for larceny and drug-related crimes.  In Pennsylvania,
juveniles represented by privately paid attorneys were more likely to
be placed than juveniles represented by other attorney types for
aggravated assault and larceny.

the small number of unrepresented and placed cases, see appendix III. 


   JUVENILES IN ADULT CRIMINAL
   COURT HAD SAME RIGHT TO
   REPRESENTATION AS ADULTS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :8

Under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution, all defendants,
including juveniles being tried as adults, have the right to &quot;the
assistance of counsel for his or her defense.&quot; We could not locate a
database containing information on how frequently juveniles were
represented in adult court.  Our review of the law showed that
juveniles tried as adults were to be afforded the same right to
representation as adults tried in criminal court.  In addition, the
results of our prosecutor's survey revealed their overall
satisfaction with the quality of counsel juveniles were receiving in
adult court. 


   QUALITY OF COUNSEL PROVIDED
   JUVENILES CONSIDERED ADEQUATE
   BY SURVEY RESPONDENTS AND LOCAL
   OFFICIALS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :9

According to state officials, no criteria existed to determine how
well juveniles were being represented by counsel, either in adult or
juvenile court.  For example, we found no national or state databases
designed to define or measure quality within the context of the
juvenile justice system.  In the absence of such criteria, we
obtained some perspective of how well juveniles were being
represented in both juvenile and adult court by soliciting the views
of juvenile justice officials around the country.  To obtain some
perspective, we conducted a nationally representative survey of
prosecutors that handle juvenile justice matters and interviewed
selected juvenile court judges in eight states.  In addition, through
personal interviews, we obtained the opinions of juvenile justice
officials in four states.  In our survey of prosecutors and
interviews with judges and various officials, we asked questions
regarding their perceptions of the quality of counsel across several
dimensions, including overall (1) preparation, (2) legal skills, and
(3) effectiveness.  The questions were targeted to the three types of
counsel that represent juveniles in both juvenile and adult courts: 
public defenders, privately paid attorneys, and court-appointed
attorneys. 

The results of our survey and discussions revealed overall
satisfaction with the quality of counsel juveniles were receiving,
both in adult and juvenile courts.  Some officials, however, raised
concerns over nonqualitative considerations that were perceived to
affect the quality of counsel, such as high caseloads and limited
state funding. 


      PROSECUTORS WERE GENERALLY
      SATISFIED WITH QUALITY OF
      ALL THREE TYPES OF COUNSEL
      PROVIDED JUVENILES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :9.1

Our survey showed that while there were some differences in quality
of these three types of counsel, the respondents generally viewed all
three types of attorneys as being sufficiently prepared, possessing
the requisite legal skills, and representing their clients
effectively.\33 For example, as table 8 shows, most prosecutors
responded that all three types of counsel in juvenile court were well
prepared.  Similarly, as shown in table 9, most prosecutors responded
that all counsel in adult court were well prepared.  (See app.  V for
additional details on our survey of prosecutors.)

Source:  GAO Survey. 

Finally, we asked prosecutors for their views on the impact of
representation on juvenile dispositions that were &quot;similar&quot; except
for the presence of counsel.  Most prosecutors believed that having
counsel did not have a big impact on the eventual outcome of the
case.  About 70 percent said that juveniles received similar
dispositions regardless of whether they had counsel.  Therefore, in
the views of most prosecutors, having representation in juvenile
court did not produce large, measurable differences in outcomes for
juveniles. 


--------------------
\33 We did not obtain a national perspective from other juvenile
justice officials (e.g., judges or public defenders). 


      JUDGES WERE GENERALLY
      SATISFIED WITH QUALITY OF
      COUNSEL PROVIDED TO
      JUVENILES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :9.2

We obtained the views of 16 judges regarding the issues related to
the quality of counsel within their jurisdictions in Florida,
Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and
Utah. 

Overall, the judges indicated that the quality of counsel provided to
juveniles in juvenile court was adequate.  For example, 10 of the 12
judges who commented on the quality of counsel provided juveniles in
juvenile court characterized their perception of quality of counsel
with responses such as &quot;acceptable,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; and &quot;excellent.&quot; In
addition, one of the 12 judges indicated that the counsel afforded
juveniles in juvenile court was as good as the counsel adults receive
in adult court.  However, when asked to comment on the quality of
counsel by attorney type (i.e., public defender, private, and
court-appointed), 7 of the 11 judges who responded indicated that
quality of counsel varied by type of attorney.  For example, four of
the seven judges noted that, of the three attorney types, public
defenders are generally more knowledgeable about issues such as
juvenile law, court proceedings, and disposition options.  One judge
of the four, in noting the public defender's familiarity with
juvenile court law, commented that he perceived public defenders as
&quot;specialists.&quot;

In commenting on the dimensions of quality representation in a
juvenile case, judges most often cited (1) legal skills, (2)
knowledge of the law, (3) commitment to the client, and (4)
preparation.  Other dimensions cited were experience, a thorough
investigation of the case, knowledge of alternatives, and meeting
with the client. 


      OFFICIALS IN FOUR STATES
      VISITED BELIEVED QUALITY OF
      COUNSEL WAS GENERALLY
      ADEQUATE, DESPITE LIMITED
      RESOURCES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :9.3

We discussed the quality of counsel issue with various juvenile court
and justice officials--including juvenile prosecutors, judges,
attorneys, service workers, and probation officers--located in eight
jurisdictions in Florida, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Utah. 
According to state officials, none of these states had developed
criteria against which quality of counsel provided could be measured. 
However, two jurisdictions had established specific qualifications
that attorneys must meet to represent juveniles in certain cases.\34

Overall our discussions with juvenile justice officials revealed
generally favorable responses concerning the quality of counsel
provided to juveniles.  Further, several of the officials in Florida,
Louisiana, and Pennsylvania indicated that, in terms of effective
representation, public defenders are at least as capable as the
private attorneys in representing juveniles.  The most frequently
cited reasons were the public defenders' familiarity and experience
with juvenile court procedures and available disposition or service
options.  For example, several of these officials noted that public
defenders may do a better job than private attorneys because they are
more knowledgeable of the laws and local rules governing juvenile
proceedings.  In Utah, one official noted that while some private
attorneys may be more aggressive, court-appointed attorneys develop
more expertise in handling juvenile cases. 

However, some of these officials raised nonqualitative considerations
that were perceived to affect the quality of counsel, such as high
caseloads and limited state funding.  They recognized that while
public defenders tended to have the most experience in juvenile law
and procedures, the officials also noted that public defenders had
very high caseloads.  For example, one official noted that because of
the limited resources, public defenders do not have as much time to
prepare and often must seek continuances while others pointed out
that the number of public defenders had not kept pace with the
increased demand for indigent defense services.  Another official
commented that the court-appointed attorneys do not have as many
resources or the time to devote to a case as private attorneys. 


--------------------
\34 The two jurisdictions included Tallahassee, Florida, and
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Tallahassee officials told us that the
Second Judicial Circuit required that, when appointing an attorney to
handle a case representing a juvenile in a case in which more than
the one juvenile is involved, the appointed attorney must (1) be an
active member in good standing of the Florida Bar Association; (2)
have at least 1 year of juvenile court practice with demonstrated
competence; (3) have had, within the past two years, some specialized
training in juvenile law or litigation; (4) be familiar with the
requisite court system, including specifically the procedural rules
regarding timeliness of filings and procedural default; and (5) have
demonstrated proficiency in and commitment to quality representation. 

The Philadelphia Criminal Rules provide guidance on the appointment
of counsel.  The rules required the juvenile court to maintain a list
of attorneys qualified for appointment in both major felony juvenile
and nonmajor felony juvenile cases.  The rules also specified that,
major felony juvenile cases (where the juvenile is likely to be
incarcerated as a juvenile or certified to an adult court), the
attorney must (1) have qualified for appointment for adult felony
cases, (2) have prior experience in at least five juvenile cases,
which were tried to completion, and (3) have had at least two major
felony juvenile cases in the past 2 years.  For all other juvenile
cases, however, the attorney must have fulfilled the requirements for
appointment of counsel in adult misdemeanor cases.  For both major
and nonmajor cases, the Rules specify that attorneys must have
completed at least one continuing legal education course in juvenile
law within the past year, are familiar with the Pennsylvania Juvenile
Act and the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Juvenile Court Rules,
and are reasonably available to accept appointment.

\a Circuit sizes range from about 1 to 5 counties.  Each judicial
circuit has a juvenile court judge, who is appointed by the circuit
court. 

\b &quot;Organized&quot; as defined by the National Center for Juvenile Justice
(NCJJ), refers to the level of government from which a service is
organized in a state.  NCJJ arrived at this definition by determining
(1) the level of government in a state from which the authority for
the provision of a service originates (e.g., probation services are
delivered at the local level but may not be organized from that
level) and (2) the level of government in a state from which the
delivery of service can be directly affected. 

\c &quot;Administered&quot; as defined by NCJJ, refers to the branch of
government that is vested with the responsibility for the day-to-day
provision of a service. 

\d In all but three counties, (Kansas City, St.  Louis City, and St. 
Louis County), every circuit court has an intake unit administered by
probation. 

\e The county executive funds a probation department that usually
supports a separate juvenile probation division.  The juvenile
probation function often includes intake and investigation services. 

\f Florida's Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services is an
integrated system that delivers social, health, and rehabilitative
services to children and youth in 11 Children, Youth and Family
districts.  Each district maintains a program office that is
responsible for integrated intake and program coordination that
encompass delinquency, child welfare, and health services. 

\g In other states, this individual may be referred to as a probation
officer. 

\h On the state level, the Department of the Youth Authority,
Community Corrections Branch, has regional offices that work closely
with county probation to run prevention and community corrections
programs.  The Department also administers state funds that flow to
county probation. 

\i The Division employs Community Control Officers to supervise
juveniles placed on community control (probation supervision) by
circuit courts and to provide aftercare supervision to juveniles
released on &quot;furlough&quot; from juvenile institutions.  Several Community
Control Unit Offices are located throughout each District. 

\j NCJJ has defined aftercare as the community supervision of youth
released from the state delinquent institution.

\a In much of Nebraska, county courts exercise jurisdiction over
juvenile matters.  However, in Douglas, Lincoln, and Sarpy counties,
separate juvenile courts exercise jurisdiction.  Nebraska statute
authorizes the establishment of separate juvenile courts in counties
with a population greater than 30,000 where authorized by the
electorate.  In Nebraska, both county courts and juvenile courts
exercise their jurisdiction over delinquency matters in concurrence
with district courts. 

\b A Juvenile Court Judges Commission advises juvenile courts on the
proper care of delinquents, establishes administrative procedures and
standards, examines personnel practices and employment standards used
in probation offices, collects and publishes statistics, administers
a grant-in-aid program to improve county juvenile probation services,
and provides training. 

\c In Allegheny and Philadelphia counties, the Family Court Division
of the Court of Common Pleas exercises jurisdiction. 

\d &quot;Organized&quot; as defined by NCJJ, refers to the level of government
from which a service is organized in a state.  NCJJ arrived at this
definition by determining (1) the level of government in a state from
which the authority for the provision of a service originates (e.g.,
probation services are delivered at the local level but may not be
organized from that level) and (2) the level of government in a state
from which the delivery of service can be directly affected. 

\e &quot;Administered&quot; as defined by NCJJ, refers to the branch of
government that is vested with the responsibility for the day-to-day
provision of a service. 

\f Juvenile probation services vary widely among counties.  The
number of staff and the caseload per probation officer are greatly
affected by the size and wealth of the particular county.  Smaller
counties generally maintain a small staff consisting of one to two
people who are likely to handle both adult and juvenile cases. 

\g Screening varies among counties.  In Douglas County, for example,
the county attorney screens the juvenile over the phone, having never
met the individual.  In Sarpy County, on the other hand, Probation
Officers screen the juvenile in person. 

\h In 1985, Nebraska's Juvenile probation services transitioned to a
statewide system.  Accordingly, juvenile probation services operate
under the Nebraska Probation System of the State Judicial Branch. 

\i NCJJ has defined aftercare as the community supervision of youth
released from the state delinquent institution.

OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY
========================================================== Appendix II

The 1992 reauthorization (P.L.  102-586) of the Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (P.L.  93-415) required us to
conduct a study of access to counsel during delinquency proceedings
in juvenile court.  In discussions with the staffs of the House
Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities (formerly the
Committee on Education and Labor) and the Senate Committee on the
Judiciary, we agreed to

  review state laws for 15 states that we selected to determine
     juveniles' right to counsel,

  determine the frequency with which juveniles have counsel in
     juvenile courts in three states,

  determine the likely impact of counsel on juvenile outcomes,

  determine if juveniles who are in adult court have counsel, and

  provide insights regarding the issue of quality of counsel. 

In addressing these objectives, we met with officials from OJJDP,
NCJJ, and other organizations familiar with juvenile justice issues,
such as the American Bar Association, National Legal Aid Defenders
Association, and the Coalition for Juvenile Justice to determine
their perspectives on juveniles' access to counsel.  We conducted a
review of literature identified in bibliographies provided by NCJJ
and OJJDP as well as articles and studies we identified.  We used
only those studies that were relevant to addressing our objectives. 
We did not evaluate the studies or their limitations.  Also, to
better understand state juvenile justice systems, we developed
profiles of juvenile justice processes in nine states:  Arizona,
California, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina, and Utah.  We developed this information from
discussions with various state and local juvenile justice officials,
court administrators, juvenile justice advocacy groups, judges, and
prosecutors.  We also reviewed state and local documents on juvenile
justice procedure and processes.  We did not verify the accuracy of
the information through a review of state statutes and administrative
rules.  These states were selected for their range of urban and rural
locations and their diversity of juvenile justice systems. 

To determine the scope of juveniles' right to counsel in selected
states, we analyzed statutes, administrative rules, and case law in
15 states:  Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana,
Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina, Texas, and Utah.  We selected these states after
considering such factors as the diversity of each state's juvenile
justice system and the availability of state juvenile court
processing data maintained by NCJJ.\1 In addition to our legal
analysis of statutes in selected states, we reviewed an analysis of
statutes nationwide prepared by NCJJ. 

To determine the frequency with which juveniles have counsel in
juvenile court, we used annual juvenile court data sets and case
records compiled and maintained by NCJJ.\2 Specifically, we analyzed
data on petitioned delinquency offenders in juvenile courts in
California, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska.  We identified four other
states with NCJJ data on counsel, which we excluded because they were
the subject of another study (Minnesota), had a relatively small
population (North Dakota), or did not have data we needed for other
mandated juvenile justice studies--e.g., Juvenile Justice:  Minimal
Gender Bias Occurred in Processing Noncriminal Juveniles
(GAO/GGD-95-56, Feb.  28, 1995).  We used the NCJJ data for the
counties in the three states for which data were available to develop
statistics for a 2-year period in California and Nebraska covering
calendar years 1990 and 1991, and for 1991 for Pennsylvania, the most
recent available data at the time of our review.  The sample for each
state was limited to petitioned delinquency cases only, excluding
status cases as well as abuse, neglect, and dependency cases, and
routine traffic offenses.  We arranged the delinquency offenses into
seven broad categories:  violent, property, simple assault, drugs,
weapons, public order, and indeterminate. 

To obtain indications of the impact of counsel on dispositions, we
did a two-part analysis.  First, we developed statistics on case
processing outcomes for each state.  Second, we developed statistical
models that controlled for variables that may affect a juvenile's
disposition, e.g., offense severity or prior history.  Specifically,
for each state, we estimated a series of logistic regression models
that investigated the relationships between the type of
representation in juvenile delinquency proceedings and key decision
points in the juvenile judicial process controlling for a number of
relevant variables.  We measured four types of representation:  (1)
no counsel, (2) privately retained counsel, (3) court-appointed
private counsel, and (4) public defender.  We analyzed two key
decision points:  (1) whether the juvenile was, in fact, adjudicated
as delinquent and (2) whether the juvenile received an out-of-home
placement as disposition of the case after adjudication.  We
estimated the models separately for each of the 3 states for up to 10
crime types. 

Data were available for five counties in California which represented
40 percent of the juvenile population between ages 10 and 17.  The
Pennsylvania data, which were only for 1991, excluded cases from
Philadelphia because Philadelphia petitions all cases, not just the
more serious cases, to juvenile court.  These limitations apply to
all results using California and Pennsylvania data.  Table 1 provides
information on the specific types of crimes falling into each offense
category in each state.  The figures in this table were computed
after excluding cases in which the type of counsel was missing in the
database.  In California, this amounted to about 5 percent of 64,275
cases; in Pennsylvania about 5 percent of the 15,397 cases; in
Nebraska about 18 percent of the 6,603 cases.  According to a
Nebraska official, data were not available on representation rates in
one of the state's larger counties.  Therefore, we also omitted this
county's cases from our analysis, which amounts to 14 percent of all
of Nebraska's cases.  However, the official added that an estimated
75 percent of the juveniles were represented at adjudication hearings
in that county. 

Regarding juveniles in adult court, we were unable to locate a
national database containing information on the frequency of
representation.  However, we discussed the matter with juvenile
justice officials during our field visits and solicited information
in our survey of prosecutors. 

To provide insights regarding the quality of counsel, we surveyed a
national sample of local prosecutors; interviewed juvenile justice
officials, such as judges at the state and local levels; and surveyed
public defender offices. 

To gather opinions and experiences of prosecutors concerning access
to counsel in the juvenile court system, we obtained 226 completed
questionnaires from a nationally representative, probability sample
of district prosecutor offices that deal with juveniles in juvenile
courts.  We first identified a stratified probability sample of
county prosecutors in 290 of the 3,110 counties in the United States. 
To gather information about large and small counties, the sample was
stratified on the basis of the number of felony convictions in 1985. 
The 1985 felony convictions were used to first draw this sample of
290 counties in 1986 for the National Judicial Reporting Program. 

We developed the questionnaire with advice from experts at NCJJ and
the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics and
pretested it with selected prosecutor offices.  The survey was mailed
in March 1994.  Two sets of follow-up telephone calls and two
additional mailings were conducted between May and July 1994. 

We contacted all 290 selected counties to determine whether they had
juvenile prosecutors and to determine the counties over which the
prosecutors had jurisdiction.  We determined that 270 of the 290
counties were eligible members of our study population of prosecutor
offices that dealt with juvenile offenders in juvenile court.  After
weighing the probabilities of selection, we estimated that the study
population consisted of approximately 2,118 such juvenile prosecutors
in the United States.  This number is less than the number of
counties (3,110), partly because some counties are consolidated under
a single juvenile prosecutor and partly because some jurisdictions do
not have prosecutors that appear in juvenile court.  Of the 270
sampled prosecutors from the study population, 226 responded, for a
response rate of 84 percent. 

We estimated all figures reported in the text from the returned
questionnaires to the estimated 2,118 juvenile prosecutor offices. 
All sample surveys are subject to sampling error.  This may occur
because the sample results may differ from what would have been
obtained if the entire population had received and returned the
questionnaire.  The size of sampling errors in any survey depends
largely on the number of respondents and the amount of variability in
the data.  In this report, all estimates, with two exceptions, are
made at the 95-percent confidence level with a sampling error of plus
or minus 10 percent.  This means that, if we drew repeated samples
from the entire study population of prosecutor offices, 19 out of 20
samples would produce estimates within 10 percent of the true
proportion in the total population.  In table 9, the estimates of 80
percent and 74 percent have confidence intervals of plus or minus
10.1 and 10.2 percent, respectively. 

In addition to the reported sampling errors, any survey may be
subject to nonsampling errors as well.  For example, differences in
how a particular question is interpreted, in the sources of
information that are available to respondents or in the types of
people who do not respond, can introduce unwanted variability into
survey results. 

We included steps in the data collection and data analysis stages to
minimize such nonsampling errors.  We selected the sample from a
complete list of all counties, and we pretested our questionnaire
with experts and members of the target population.  Our extensive
follow-up efforts were designed to maximize the response rate, and we
achieved a final response rate of 84 percent.  All data were keyed
twice and verified during data entry, and all computer analyses were
reviewed by a second, independent analyst. 

We also administered a semistructured interview to 16 judges to
gather information concerning their views on the quality of counsel
provided to juveniles.  We asked the judges about their perceptions
related to quality of counsel for the three types of counsel provided
to juveniles--public defenders, private attorneys, and
court-appointed counsel.  The judges--located in Florida, Louisiana,
Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Utah--were
judgmentally selected on the basis of their availability, and their
views do not necessarily represent those of other judges. 

We also sent a questionnaire to 26 state-level public defender
offices.  We selected those states that, according to officials from
the National Legal Aid Defenders' Association, comprised the universe
of statewide public defender offices that represented juvenile
delinquents.  We received 19 responses and followed up with telephone
calls for clarification. 

In reporting survey and interview results from juvenile justice
officials, we did not evaluate their responses for possible biases. 

To develop comparative information about the availability of counsel
for delinquents, we visited a total of eight jurisdictions within
each of four states.  Those jurisdictions included Tallahassee and
Tampa, Florida; Baton Rouge and West Francisville, Louisiana;
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Salt Lake City, Logan, and Ogden,
Utah.  We judgmentally selected Florida, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and
Utah on the basis of several factors, such as the large concentration
of juvenile offenders, the diversity of juvenile justice systems, the
range of urban and rural locations, and the availability of state
juvenile court processing data from NCJJ.  Generally in each of the
selected states, we interviewed local judges, prosecutors, and public
defenders as well as representatives of juvenile courts, bar
associations, and state child welfare agencies.  We selected them on
the basis of their availability at the time of our visits.  Where
possible, we obtained statistical information on access to counsel,
which was maintained by the jurisdiction, and observed juvenile
proceedings in session. 


--------------------
\1 Each year, NCJJ collects juvenile court processing data for up to
26 states. 

\2 We used data that were housed in and made available by the
National Juvenile Court Data Archive, which is maintained by NCJJ and
supported by a grant from OJJDP.  These data were originally
collected by the Alameda County, CA, Probation Department; the Los
Angeles County, CA, Probation Department; the San Francisco County,
CA, Juvenile Probation Department; the San Joaquin County, CA,
Probation Department; the County of Ventura, CA, Corrections Services
Agency; the Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal
Justice; and the Pennsylvania Center for Juvenile Justice Training
and Research.  Neither the original data collectors nor NCJJ bear any
responsibility for our analyses or interpretations of the data. 


METHODS FOR ANALYZING THE
FREQUENCY OF REPRESENTATION AND
IMPACTS OF COUNSEL ON JUVENILE
COURT OUTCOMES
========================================================= Appendix III

This appendix discusses the methods we used (1) to review the
frequency with which juveniles accused of delinquent activities
received counsel and (2) to assess the impact of counsel on two
juvenile court outcomes.  For each issue, we restricted our analysis
to cases petitioned to juvenile court that were disposed in calendar
years 1990 and 1991 in California, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania.  For
the purposes of this analysis, we used the term case to refer to a
single juvenile defendant.  We used petitioned to refer to defendants
who had adjudicatory hearings or who were handled in a formal manner
by the juvenile court. 


   APPROACH OF THE REVIEW
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:1

To review the frequency of representation, we identified cases of
juveniles petitioned to court and then determined if they had legal
representation during the processing of their cases.  We looked at
whether represented juveniles differed from those without
representation on three characteristics:  (1) the type of crime with
which they were charged, (2) their offense history, and (3) the
location of the court in more urban or more rural counties. 

We reviewed the relationship between legal representation and two
juvenile court outcomes--adjudication as delinquent and receiving an
out-of-home placement after being adjudicated as delinquent. 
Adjudication refers to the fact-finding hearing in which the juvenile
court determines whether or not there is sufficient evidence to
sustain the allegations in a petition.  Out-of-home placement refers
to post-adjudication dispositions that result in the placement of the
juvenile outside his or her own home, regardless of whether such
placement is in a secure or nonsecure facility. 

To analyze these relationships we compared the differences in
outcomes for juveniles who were represented against those who were
not, controlling only for the type of crime.  Second, to control for
variables other than the type of representation, which may also be
associated with juvenile court outcomes, we conducted regression
analysis of the relationship between the outcomes and juveniles' case
characteristics.  Specifically, we estimated separate logistic
regressions for up to 10 crime types in each of the 3 states for each
of the 2 juvenile court outcomes:  (1) whether a juvenile was
adjudicated as delinquent and (2) whether an adjudicated juvenile
delinquent was placed out-of-home\1 .  In estimating these equations,
we controlled for three classes of characteristics (1) demographic
variables, such as age, race, and gender; (2) offense and
offender-behavior variables, such as current offense, offense
history, and juvenile court supervisory status; and (3) juvenile
court processing variables, such as detention prior to adjudication
and the location of the court.\2

We estimated these regressions to answer three general questions: 
(1) What were the independent or main effects of whether a juvenile
was represented on the likelihood either of being adjudicated or of
being placed?  (2) What difference did the type of counsel--public
defender, court appointed, and privately paid--have on these
likelihoods?  and (3) What independent variables had the largest
impacts on the dependent variables? 


--------------------
\1 These two dependent variables--adjudicated and placed--were
dichotomous dependent variables.  Each had only two possible values. 
Juveniles' cases either were adjudicated as delinquent or they were
not.  Similarly, they either were placed out-of-home or they were
not.  In our analysis, we looked first at whether a case was
adjudicated and second, only for those cases that were adjudicated,
we looked at whether they were placed.  We did not identify types of
placements because of data limitations. 

\2 The specific crime types and variables used in the models are
discussed in more detail in the following sections. 


   APPROACH, DATA, AND METHODS TO
   THE ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2

In general, we discuss three types of analyses in this appendix. 
First, we analyzed the data to determine the number of cases in which
juveniles were represented or not.  Drawing on issues raised in the
literature, we analyzed the representation rates for a number of
characteristics, including type of offense, offense history, and
location of juvenile courts. 

Second, we compared juvenile court outcomes--whether adjudicated or
placed out-of-home--of juveniles who were represented with those who
were not represented.  We reported the aggregate differences between
these two groups by offense categories. 

Third, because juvenile court outcomes depend on more than whether a
juvenile had counsel, we estimated logistic regressions to determine
the independent impacts of the three types of representation on the
likelihood of adjudication and placement controlling for other
characteristics that affect these likelihoods.  In addition, we
sought to determine which characteristics were most strongly
associated with these likelihoods. 


      DATA
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.1

We used juvenile court case-level data from California, Nebraska, and
Pennsylvania for cases disposed in calendar years 1990 and 1991.\3 We
obtained these data from the National Juvenile Court Data Archive
(NJCDA) of the NCJJ.  We obtained the data on magnetic tape, and we
performed our own analysis of these data.  We consulted with research
staff at NCJJ to obtain assistance in understanding the data and in
classifying certain variables for analysis.  For example, we obtained
assistance in categorizing the specific statutory offenses or
behaviors that were recorded on the data tapes into offense
categories and offense types that we could use in the analysis. 

The data from California were limited to five of the largest counties
(Alameda, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jaoquin, and Ventura) that
reported their data to the NJCDA.  These counties represented about
40 percent of the state's juvenile population between ages 10 and 17. 

For Pennsylvania, we used only the 1991 data, and we did not include
data from Philadelphia.  In 1991, 14,584 cases were petitioned to
juvenile courts in Pennsylvania in counties other than Philadelphia
county, where there were 8,102 cases.  Those petitioned in
Philadelphia county were not directly comparable with those in the
rest of the state because Philadelphia petitions all juvenile cases
to court--regardless of the severity of the offense.  In the rest of
the state, petitioned cases are usually limited to the more serious
offenses or more serious offenders.  In addition, we limited
ourselves to the 1991 data because in 1990, Pennsylvania did not
report data on the offense history of juveniles, and therefore we
could not analyze representation rates by looking at offense history. 
For similar reasons, we did not include data from Philadelphia county
for either year.  In addition, Philadelphia also did not report on
the prior offense history of juveniles and certain other variables
that we used in our analysis.  We were able to report, however, the
overall representation rates for Pennsylvania in 1990 and
Philadelphia in 1991.  (See the notes in table III.3.)

Nebraska reported data from all of its counties in 1990 and 1991. 
However, Nebraska had the highest percentage of cases across the
three states in which the type of counsel was not reported (about 18
percent).  In addition, we had to omit cases from one of the largest
counties in Nebraska because of the way it measured legal
representation.  According to a state official, unlike the other
counties, in that one large county, the type or lack of legal
representation is recorded when a juvenile arrives at intake.  At
intake, few juveniles are accompanied by attorneys; therefore, most
cases in that county are reported as not having counsel.  However,
the state official indicated that about 75 percent of juveniles who
appeared before judges at adjudicatory hearings in that county were
represented by attorneys even though the reporting system indicated
that they were unrepresented.  Because the data systems did not
indicate this change in representation, we deleted these cases from
our analysis.  There were 905 cases petitioned to juvenile court in
this county, or about 16 percent of all petitioned cases in Nebraska. 


--------------------
\3 These were the most recent data that we were able to obtain from
NCJJ at the time we began our analysis. 


      SAMPLE SELECTION ISSUES
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.2

For all three states, we limited our analysis to those cases that
were petitioned to or formally handled by the juvenile courts for
delinquency offenses.  This choice was made irrespective of the final
disposition of cases. 


      CRIME CATEGORIES
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.3

To analyze these data, we classified detailed information on the
offenses for which juveniles were petitioned to court into broader
offense categories.  For example, the original California data
identified offenses by the particular California statute and section
that was violated.  More than 1,000 potential types of violations
were listed.  In Pennsylvania, a few hundred specific offenses were
listed with which a juvenile could be charged.  We created seven
broad classes or categories of crimes, which we used in the
descriptive analysis to show representation rates and differences in
juvenile court outcomes between represented and unrepresented
juveniles.  Within these broader categories, we defined several
specific crime categories.  We used these more specific crime types
in our regression analyses to control for the wide variation in
behaviors that were represented in the general crime categories.  See
table 1 for our classification scheme. 

For each state we estimated regressions for different sets of crime
types.  The specific number and types of crimes were determined by
the available data.  In California, we estimated regressions for 10
different crime types.  In Pennsylvania, we estimated 9 and in
Nebraska, we estimated regressions for 5 crime types.  The
determination as to whether or not a regression could be estimated
was based on the number of cases falling into each crime type. 


      REGRESSION METHODS
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.4

We estimated logistic regressions for two dichotomous dependent
variables:  (1) whether a case was adjudicated as delinquent and (2)
whether a case was placed out-of-home. 

  First, we estimated these regressions to determine the independent
     effects of representation on juvenile court outcomes when we
     controlled for relevant variables that also might have been
     associated with these outcomes.  This was a refinement of our
     earlier analysis in which we simply reported the aggregated
     differences in whether adjudication or placement was likely for
     counseled versus uncounseled juveniles. 

  Second, we estimated the regressions to determine whether variables
     representing the presence of counsel or other factors were more
     strongly associated with the two outcomes.  We did this to
     determine the relative importance of counsel in predicting
     juvenile court outcomes. 

  Third, we estimated the regressions to analyze the effects of
     different types of counsel on these two outcomes.  We estimated
     the independent effects of having no counsel, privately retained
     counsel, court-appointed private counsel, and public defender
     representation on the likelihood of adjudication and placement. 
     We were able to note differences in the effects or impacts of
     the types of counsel for various types of crime across the three
     states. 

We fit the data using maximum likelihood techniques.\4 We tested
alternative specifications using likelihood ratio tests to arrive at
our final models.\5

We used the parameters from the models and the means of the variables
in the models to estimate probabilities in order to compare the
differences in the likelihood of adjudication or placement resulting
from lack of representation and from different types of counsel.  We
made these comparisons by estimating the overall probabilities from
the variables in the models.  Then we estimated separate sets of
probabilities for each type of counsel.  The differences in the
estimated probabilities give an indication of the differences in the
likelihood of obtaining an outcome for a particular type of counsel,
as compared with the overall estimated likelihood of obtaining that
outcome. 

In addition, because the parameters from logistic regressions are not
easily interpretable, we exponentiated the estimated parameters to
form the odds ratio for each variable in the final models.  The odds
ratios have a relatively straightforward interpretation.  The odds
ratio is an estimate of how much more or less likely it is for the
outcome of interest to be present among those having a particular
characteristic than those not having that characteristic.  For
example, an odds ratio of four for a variable indicating that a case
was unrepresented would be interpreted to show that unrepresented
cases were four times as likely as represented cases to have the
outcome of interest.  Our discussion of the effects of variables on
the outcomes is based largely on the use of odds ratios. 


--------------------
\4 We used the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) logistic procedure
to estimate the parameters in the models.  SAS uses iteratively
reweighted least squares to compute its estimates.  See, for example,
SAS/STAT User's Guide, Volume 2, GLM-VARCOMP, Version 6, Fourth
Edition.  Cary, NC:  The SAS Institute, 1990. 

\5 As part of this effort, we used stepwise regression procedures to
eliminate variables that did not add to the overall &quot;goodness of fit&quot;
of each of the models. 


      VARIABLES USED IN THE
      REGRESSION ANALYSES
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.5

As mentioned, we estimated models for two dependent or outcome
variables:  (1) whether a case was adjudicated as delinquent and (2)
whether a case was placed out-of-home.  We used three broad
categories of independent variables in these regressions and specific
variables used in the models fell within these categories.  On the
basis of existing literature, we used (1) demographic, (2)
offense-related, and (3) court-related broad classes of variables. 

Demographic variables included the juvenile's age, race, and gender. 
We included these variables in the analysis because the literature on
juvenile court dispositions identifies them either as important
determinants of outcomes or as indicators of important hypotheses
about judicial decisionmaking.  For example, age is important in
determining outcomes because judges may not want to commit very young
juveniles to out-of-home placements.  Gender and race may be
important indicators of bias. 

Offense-related variables included the current offense, more or less
serious offense behavior within offense types, and prior offense
history.  These variables give indications of the seriousness of the
behavior for which a juvenile is being judged and the seriousness of
the offender.  More serious offenses and more serious offenders
(e.g., &quot;career offenders&quot;) generally are viewed as more likely to be
adjudicated as delinquent or to receive out-of-home placements. 
Omitting these variables may lead to overestimates of the effects of
types of or lack of counsel on juvenile court outcomes. 

Finally, court-related variables included those related to judicial
processing and those related to location or geography.  The court
processing variables included whether a case was represented and if
so the type of counsel, detention prior to adjudication, the length
of time it took to dispose of a case, the source of referral to
juvenile court, whether a juvenile was under supervisory status at
the time of referral, and whether charges changed between referral
and disposition.  The location variables included whether the court
was in a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan county\6 and the population
density of the county in which the case was heard. 

These variables were included for different reasons.  The measures on
types of and lack of counsel were related to the key questions of
this analysis.  Detention prior to adjudication or placement gave
another indication of the severity of the case or of the need to
ensure that a juvenile would appear for a hearing.  The length of
time it took to dispose of a case may indicate the lack of evidence
in a case, the weakness of a case, or the complexity of a case. 
Cases disposed of quickly may have been stronger or simpler cases. 
Change of charges, particularly a decrease in the severity of the
charges, indicates the severity of the case.  Finally, location
variables at a minimum helped to classify courts into types of
counties.  The literature suggests that rural courts are
characterized by less formal processes in which a judge may know the
juvenile or juvenile's family personally and use that information in
deciding cases.  Urban courts are characterized as having more formal
mechanisms for deciding cases. 

Not all variables were available in each state's database and, in
some cases, variables were measured differently across the states
because of the way events were recorded in their juvenile courts. 
Table III.1 shows the variables available for use, whether they were
used in a state, and if so, how they were measured in that state.

                      its data came from
                      five counties, all
                      of which fell in
                      metropolitan
                      areas.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to these variables, we included other variables to
indicate missing values for the variables measuring type of counsel
and prior offense history for the crime types in which there were
comparatively large numbers of missing cases (e.g., greater than 10
percent of the total number of cases).  We included these variables
to determine if missing values were associated with the dependent
variables. 


--------------------
\6 We defined metropolitan counties as those counties falling within
a primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA) or metropolitan
statistical area (MSA), as defined by the U.S.  Bureau of the Census. 
Nonmetropolitan counties fell outside of PMSAs or MSAs.  These
designations were chosen as proxies for urban and less densely
populated areas.  The data we obtained did not have measures of
location that would have permitted us to identify urban and rural
areas, as defined by Census.  For California, all of the cases came
from metropolitan counties.  For Pennsylvania, about 90 percent of
the cases were from metropolitan counties.  For Nebraska, about 55
percent of all cases were from metropolitan counties. 


      OMITTED VARIABLES
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.6

As in all modeling efforts, the results are interpretable only in the
context of the variables included in the models.  Excluding relevant
variables from the models, such as a juvenile's demeanor or a
judges's personal knowledge of a case, could affect the estimates of
the effects of variables in the models.  It is not possible, a
priori, to determine the direction or magnitude of such effects of
all potentially relevant variables that may have been excluded from
the models.  We tried to produce models that were reasonable, that
is, that included at least some of the important variables identified
in the literature.  Ultimately, we were constrained in our efforts by
the variables contained in each state's database. 


      SAMPLE SELECTION AND CASES
      ANALYZED
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:2.7

We estimated separate regressions for up to 10 crime types for the
adjudication and placement outcomes in each state.  Table III.2 shows
the crime types for which we estimated models.  We selected these
crime types primarily because of the number of cases available for
analysis with the exception of public order offenses.  We did not
estimate models for public order offenses largely because of the
relative lack of seriousness of these offenses.  We also did not
estimate models for indeterminate offenses because we could not
ascertain the crime type.  We did not estimate models for other
offense categories because of the wide variation in crime types
falling into that category. 

For the adjudication models, we selected those cases that were
petitioned to juvenile court or otherwise handled more formally at
the initial processing of the case.\7 For the placement models, we
selected only those cases that were adjudicated as delinquent.

\a No model was constructed for this crime type generally because of
the limited number of cases. 

\b Drug trafficking and drug possession crimes were combined in
Nebraska. 


--------------------
\7 Because states' procedures for handling cases formally and
informally vary, this choice did not necessarily exclude cases whose
final disposition was made by an informal adjustment.  For example,
in Pennsylvania, there are differences between Philadelphia county
and the rest of the state in terms of which cases are petitioned to
juvenile court.  Philadelphia county petitions all cases, regardless
of seriousness, and then decides whether to dispose of cases formally
through adjudication or informally by another mechanism, such as the
consent decree.  Further, regardless of the county in Pennsylvania,
consent decrees are used as informal adjustments after cases are
petitioned to court.  In cases disposed of by consent decrees, a
juvenile master, rather than a juvenile court judge, hears the case;
juveniles do not appear for an adjudicatory hearing; and juveniles
tend not to receive legal representation in these cases. 


   RESULTS
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:3

The results of our analyses are discussed in two sections.  First, we
reviewed the findings on the frequency of representation and on the
differences in the probabilities of adjudication and placement for
unrepresented juveniles compared with represented juveniles in the
detailed crime type classifications.  Then we discuss three results
from the modeling exercise:  (1) the effects of lack of
representation on the likelihoods of adjudication and placement; (2)
the effects of different types of counsel on the estimated
probabilities of adjudication and placement; and (3) the variables
that had the strongest associations with the adjudication and
placement outcomes. 


      REPRESENTATION RATES
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:3.1

As table III.3 shows, the representation rates varied among the
states.  Overall, juveniles in California were more likely to be
represented for all serious crime types.  More than 99 percent of all
violent offenders and more than 98 percent of all property offenders
in California were represented.  Only for the relatively less serious
crime types, public order offenses, did the representation rate in
California drop below 90 percent.  Besides that one crime category,
over 99 percent of juveniles in California would have been
represented.

Note:  The figures in this table and in tables III.4 and III.5 were
computed after excluding cases in which the type of counsel was
missing in the database.  In California, this amounted to about 5
percent of 64,275 cases and in Pennsylvania about 5 percent of the
15,397 cases.  These data are for only those counties for which data
were available. 

\a In California, data were available only from five counties.  These
included some of the largest counties, and they represented about 40
percent of the juvenile population between ages 10 and 17. 

\b Data for Pennsylvania were for 1991 only, and they did not include
Philadelphia county.  Philadelphia accounted for an additional 8,102
cases in 1991, and there were no reported cases of unrepresented
juveniles in Philadelphia.  (See the text for more details on the
data limitations.)

\c Data for Nebraska exclude one of the larger counties, which
accounted for 906 cases.  These cases were excluded because the
variable that indicated whether cases were represented by legal
counsel was incorrectly recorded. 

\d The murder category includes the crimes of murder and nonnegligent
manslaughter. 

\e The fraud category includes the crimes of fraud, forgery, and
embezzlement. 

\f The larceny category includes unspecified larcenies in
Pennsylvania and Nebraska. 

\g The public order category includes other nonviolent offenses. 

\h Drug crimes in Nebraska were not broken down by type; therefore,
we could not distinguish between drug possession and drug trafficking
there. 

\i No cases were reported. 

Source:  GAO analysis of NCJJ data. 

In Pennsylvania, the representation rates were similar, although
slightly lower, than California's.  Nevertheless, 94 percent of all
violent offenders in Pennsylvania were represented.  Apart from fraud
(with relatively few cases) and other property offenses, more than 88
percent of Pennsylvania's property offenders were represented.  As in
California, for comparatively less serious offenses, the
representation rates were slightly lower in Pennsylvania. 

In Nebraska, however, representation rates are comparatively low at
about 65 percent overall.  These rates seem to decrease as crimes
become less serious.  For example, violent offenders in Nebraska
generally are more likely to be represented than property offenders. 


      COMPARATIVE PROBABILITIES OF
      ADJUDICATION
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:3.2

Table III.4 shows the comparative probabilities of adjudication for
represented and unrepresented juveniles for the detailed crime type
classifications.  In general, for California and Pennsylvania,
unrepresented juveniles were less likely to be adjudicated than those
represented.  In Nebraska, conversely, unrepresented juveniles were
more likely to be adjudicated as delinquent.

\a In California, data were available only from five counties.  These
included some of the largest counties, and they represented about 40
percent of the juvenile population between age 10 and 17. 

\b Data for Pennsylvania were for 1991 only, and they did not include
Philadelphia county.  Philadelphia accounted for an additional 8102
cases in 1991, and there were no reported cases of unrepresented
juveniles in Philadelphia.  (See the text for more details on the
data limitations.)

Table III.4 shows the relatively few unrepresented juvenile cases in
California and Pennsylvania for many crime types.  In California, for
four of the nine crime types--all having fewer than 20 unrepresented
juvenile cases--the probability of adjudication was higher for
unrepresented juveniles.  Overall in California, only 946 of the
41,985 adjudicated cases (or 2.2 percent) in table III.3 were
unrepresented.  In Pennsylvania, of the 8,488 cases that were
adjudicated, only 305 (or about 3 percent) were unrepresented.  The
differences in the likelihood of adjudication between unrepresented
and represented cases in California are based on relatively few
unrepresented juvenile cases.  For Pennsylvania, the same caveat
holds true, that is, differences in the likelihood of adjudication
between represented and unrepresented juveniles are based on a
relatively small number of unrepresented cases. 

In Pennsylvania, only for arson did the probability of adjudication
for unrepresented juveniles exceed that of represented juveniles, and
there were fewer than 20 arson cases.  This suggests that a higher
likelihood of adjudication for unrepresented juveniles as compared
with represented juveniles in California and Pennsylvania was a
relatively rare event.  The higher likelihood in these cases may be
due to specific circumstances in the case that may not have been
measured or recorded in the state's juvenile court databases. 

In Nebraska, however, the probability of adjudication is higher for
unrepresented juveniles than for represented juveniles for many crime
types, whether or not there are relatively few unrepresented juvenile
cases.  Overall, 2,156 of the 4,580 adjudicated cases (47 percent)
were unrepresented in Nebraska. 


      COMPARATIVE PROBABILITIES OF
      PLACEMENT
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:3.3

Table III.5 shows the comparative probabilities of placement for
unrepresented and represented juveniles adjudicated in the three
states.  For most crime types across the three states, unrepresented
juveniles were less likely to receive out-of-home placements than
represented juveniles, and, as with the adjudication outcomes, there
were a number of crime types with relatively few unrepresented cases
(i.e., fewer than 20 cases) where juveniles faced placement
decisions.

Some exceptions occurred in California.  In most of the cases in
which unrepresented juveniles were more likely than those represented
to be placed, there were fewer than 20 unrepresented juvenile cases. 
The exception to this rule was for other property offenses, but these
cases tend to include relatively minor property offenses, such as
possession of stolen property. 

For Pennsylvania and Nebraska, arson in Nebraska was the only crime
type in which unrepresented juveniles were more likely to be placed
than those represented, and that result was based on fewer than 20
unrepresented juvenile cases.  The major difference between
California and both Pennsylvania and Nebraska was the prevalence with
which each state used out-of-home placements as a juvenile court
disposition.  California used placements at a higher rate than the
other two states.  Consequently, unrepresented juveniles in
California face an overall risk of placement that is somewhat higher
than in the other states, despite the fact that there were relatively
few unrepresented juvenile cases being placed in California. 
However, because so few juveniles were unrepresented in California,
the likelihood that a juvenile was both unrepresented and placed was
lowest there of the three states. 


   RESULTS FROM THE REGRESSION
   MODELS
------------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4

Because we found differences in the comparative probabilities of
adjudication and placement between unrepresented and represented
juveniles, we looked more closely at the likelihood of receiving
these outcomes as a function of whether a case received legal
representation and the other characteristics of a case that may
determine these outcomes.  Thus, we used the regressions first to
determine if the lack of representation had an independent effect on
the likelihood of adjudication and placement. 

Second, given the relatively small number of unrepresented cases in
California and Pennsylvania, we analyzed the effect on adjudication
and placement outcomes of the different types of counsel.  Third,
given the importance of offense severity and offense history to
judicial decisions, we used the regressions to determine whether
these and other variables had stronger effects on the likelihood of
adjudication and placement than did the lack or type of
representation. 

In interpreting the regression results, two caveats should be
considered.  First, selection effects can influence outcomes at each
stage.  Selection effects refer to the process whereby juveniles
having selected characteristics are the ones who move onto a
particular stage of processing.  The characteristics used to select
the juveniles who move onto the next stage are important if they also
are the characteristics used to determine whether or not a juvenile
receives representation.  For example, if juveniles who commit less
serious crimes are less likely to be adjudicated and less likely to
receive representation because they are less likely to be
adjudicated, then these selection effects may cause our regressions
to over-estimate the effects of representation on juvenile court
outcomes. 

Second, although we used relatively narrow crime types, the crime
types encompass a relatively wide range of behaviors for which data
were not available.  For example, data on victim injury in robbery or
assault cases were not available, but victim injury may be important
in judges' decisionmaking.  Similarly, these unmeasured behaviors may
also be related to the provision of counsel and thus have some effect
on the estimates of counsel's impact on juvenile court outcomes.\8


--------------------
\8 The data in tables III.3, III.4, and III.5 report probabilities of
various outcomes.  Some of these are quite high (e.g., California's
percentage represented).  If the grouped data were used in the
regressions, we would encounter problems of restricted variances and
variables would not covary with the dependent variable.  By using the
individual-level data and estimating logistic regressions, we
eliminated this potential problem. 


      ADJUDICATION OUTCOMES
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4.1

In the following discussion, the results of our analysis of
adjudication outcomes are considered on a state-by-state basis.  The
effects of the lack of representation on adjudication are discussed
followed by the effects of different types of representation.  The
effects of other variables on adjudication concludes the review of
each state. 


         CALIFORNIA
--------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4.1.1

In California, almost all adjudicated cases were represented. 
Specifically, of the 41,985 cases reported as adjudicated on table
III.3, only 946 were unrepresented.  As a result, there were
relatively few unrepresented cases from which to derive estimates of
the effects of lacking representation on the likelihood of
adjudication.\9 Nevertheless, for 7 of the 10 crime types for which
we estimated adjudication models in California, we found that the
lack of representation did not exert independent effects on the
likelihood of adjudication.  For burglary, larceny, and weapons, the
lack of representation had an independent effect on the likelihood of
adjudication after controlling for the other relevant variables
identified in table III.1.\10 For burglary and weapons, the lack of
representation was associated with lower likelihoods (as compared
with represented cases), but for larceny it was associated with a
higher likelihood of adjudication.  Specifically, unrepresented
burglars were about one-half as likely to have their cases
adjudicated as those represented.  Unrepresented juveniles with cases
involving weapons were about four-tenths as likely to have their
cases adjudicated as those represented.  Conversely, unrepresented
juveniles with larceny cases were about one and one-half times more
likely to be adjudicated than those represented. 

For robbery and drug trafficking cases, the lack of representation
was negatively associated with the likelihood of adjudication, but
the effects were too small to be considered meaningful. 

The lack of representation had some independent effects on the
likelihood of adjudication for some crime types in California. 
However, the effects operated in opposite directions across crimes,
were not widespread across crime types, and generally were small
relative to the size of the effects of other variables. 

The influence of the type of representation was also difficult to
characterize.  In California, most cases were represented by either
public defenders or by court-appointed private representation. 
Privately paid attorneys represented juveniles in about 3 percent of
the cases.  Thus, the main comparisons between types of
representation are between public defenders and court-appointed
private representation.  In general, the effects of these two types
of representation on the likelihood of adjudication were mixed. 
Juveniles represented by court- appointed private attorneys were more
likely to be adjudicated than those represented by public defenders,
for drugs and simple assault, but less likely for rape and aggravated
assault.  Thus, court-appointed private attorneys likely decrease the
chances of adjudication in the more serious crimes.  Of course, this
result may be due in part to the public defender workload and other
factors. 

The absence of consistent effects of the lack or type of
representation on the likelihood of adjudication indicates that
variables other than representation may be more responsible for
determining judicial decisions than the type of representation.  In
fact, this appears to be the case.  We used the models to identify
those variables that had consistently large effects across equations. 
We found that three variables had large effects on the likelihood of
adjudication across most types of crimes.  These variables were
whether a case was under court supervision (ward probation) at the
time of referral, whether a juvenile was detained prior to
adjudication, and the location of the court (i.e., the county in
which a case was heard).  A fourth variable, the age of the juvenile,
also was strongly associated with the likelihood of adjudication, but
the effects of age were not as consistent nor strong as these other
variables. 

Juveniles &quot;on ward probation&quot;\11 at the time the current offense was
committed were from 1.6 to 3.1 times more likely to have their cases
adjudicated than those not on ward probation for the crimes of
robbery, aggravated assault, simple assault, burglary, larceny,
weapons, drug possession, and drug trafficking.  Across crime types,
juveniles detained prior to adjudication were from 1.2 to 1.5 times
as likely as those not detained to have their cases adjudicated. 
Across different locations, the likelihood of adjudication varied. 
Depending upon the location of the court and the type of crime,
juveniles could be more likely to have their cases adjudicated (from
1.2 to 3.9 times as likely) or less likely to have them adjudicated
(about one-half as likely).  Older juveniles were slightly less
likely to have their cases adjudicated than younger juveniles. 

Finally, for some specific crime types, other variables, such as race
and gender, were associated with adjudicatory outcomes.  For example,
males referred for aggravated assault were slightly less likely to
have their cases adjudicated than females referred for that crime. 
In addition, blacks referred for drug possession were less likely
than persons of other races to have their cases adjudicated. 


--------------------
\9 The relatively small number of unrepresented cases constrained our
choice of model specification to using a dummy variable to indicate
the absence of counsel.  We would have preferred to estimate separate
equations for unrepresented and represented cases and compare the
parameter estimates across the equations for all variables in the
models.  This latter approach is equivalent to estimating one model
with a complete set of interactions with the counsel dummy variable. 
It has the added advantage, however, of not imposing the assumption
of equal variances between the uncounseled and counseled equations,
as is implicit in the fully saturated model.  The implications of
constraining the variances relate mostly to hypothesis tests on
individual variables. 

\10 The final equations for each crime type contained a different
subset of the variables listed on table III.1.  The final variables
in the models were determined by the contribution of individual
variables to the overall goodness of fit of the model to the data. 
The parameter estimates, odds ratios, and variances for variables
used in the 28 adjudication models are available upon request from
us. 

\11 Ward probation refers to supervision of a juvenile as a &quot;ward of
the court.&quot;


         PENNSYLVANIA
--------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4.1.2

As was the case in California, most adjudicated cases in Pennsylvania
were represented.  Of the 8,488 adjudicated cases, only about 3
percent were unrepresented.  Thus, while we tested for the effects of
the lack of representation on adjudication outcomes, unrepresented
cases were rare, and unrepresented adjudicated cases were even rarer. 

For two of nine crime types in our regressions, the lack of
representation exerted an independent and negative effect on the
likelihood of adjudication.  Burglary and simple assault cases that
were unrepresented were less likely to be adjudicated than cases in
those crime types that were represented.\12

Unrepresented juveniles in burglary cases were about four-tenths as
likely to have their cases adjudicated as those who were represented;
unrepresented juveniles in simple assault cases were about half as
likely. 

There were generally no large differences in the effects of the
various types of representation on the likelihood of adjudication
across the crime types.  Thus, type of representation also did not
have consistent effects on adjudicatory outcomes. 

In Pennsylvania, the variables that were most strongly associated
with the likelihood of adjudication were whether a consent decree was
ordered and whether a case was detained prior to adjudication.  The
type of offense was strongly associated with the likelihood of
adjudication, but its effects were not consistent across crime types. 

Consent decrees are used in place of adjudications for certain,
relatively less serious cases in Pennsylvania.  Most unrepresented
juvenile cases for robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny,
and simple assault were disposed of by consent decrees.  Juveniles
detained prior to adjudication increased the likelihood of having
their cases adjudicated, relative to juveniles not detained, for all
crimes except weapons.  Juveniles detained were from two to seven
times more likely to have their cases adjudicated than those not
detained. 

In simple assault and burglary cases--where the gap between
unrepresented and represented cases persisted--variables other than
the lack of representation had larger effects on the likelihood of
adjudication than did the lack of representation.  Cases disposed of
by consent decrees; cases in which juveniles have been detained prior
to adjudication; and cases where either the location of the court
(for simple assault), the gender, and the length of time before
disposition (for burglary) all produced larger changes in the
likelihood of adjudication than did the lack of representation. 

In addition, race exerted independent influences on the likelihood of
adjudication in robbery and rape cases and gender exerted independent
influences on the likelihood of adjudication in burglary, larceny,
and drug possession cases.  Black juveniles referred for rape or
robbery were less likely (0.102 and 0.255 times) than other juveniles
to have their cases adjudicated.  Males referred for burglary,
larceny, and drug possession were more likely than females (2.63,
1.5, and 2.5 times) to have their cases adjudicated. 

Thus, as in California, variables associated with case processing
were more strongly associated with the likelihood of adjudication in
Pennsylvania than with the lack of representation for most crime
types. 


--------------------
\12 Unrepresented juveniles in weapons cases also were less likely to
have their cases adjudicated than those who were represented;
however, this finding was based on fewer than 10 cases, 2 of which
were adjudicated.  In our view, this was too few cases for a
substantive finding. 


         NEBRASKA
--------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4.1.3

Unlike California and Pennsylvania, juveniles in Nebraska had about
half (47.1 percent) of their adjudicated cases unrepresented. 
Further, Nebraska adjudicated about one-ninth as many cases as
California, but Nebraska also had more than twice the number of
unrepresented adjudicated juvenile cases as California.  Similar
discrepancies occurred in comparing Nebraska to Pennsylvania.  Thus,
Nebraska's case is very different from the other two states. 

The results from the regressions show that Nebraska differs from
California and Pennsylvania.  First, after controlling for juveniles'
characteristics, unrepresented juveniles were less likely to be
adjudicated only for larceny--a relatively less serious property
offense.  In larceny cases, unrepresented juveniles were about
four-tenths as likely to have their cases adjudicated as those who
were represented.  For all other crime types, unrepresented and
represented juveniles were about equal in the probability of having
their cases adjudicated, after controlling for juveniles'
characteristics. 

Second, the type of representation was not systematically related to
the likelihood of adjudication across crime types.  Juveniles
represented by court-appointed private attorneys were about half as
likely to have their cases adjudicated than those represented by
public defenders for simple assault and larceny crimes.  Juveniles
represented by privately paid attorneys were half as likely to have
their cases adjudicated in simple assault cases as compared with
those represented by public defenders.  In weapons cases, however,
juveniles represented by privately paid attorneys were about 10 times
more likely to have their cases adjudicated than those represented by
public defenders.  In general, juveniles represented by public
defenders were more likely to have their cases adjudicated than those
represented by other types of attorneys or those that were
unrepresented (except for weapons cases). 

Third, measures of the location of the court in which a juvenile's
case was heard had the largest effect on the likelihood of
adjudication across crime types.  The population density of the
county where the court was located had the strongest association with
the likelihood that a case was adjudicated for the crimes of simple
assault, burglary, larceny, and weapons.  The association was
negative, that is, as the population density of the county increased,
the likelihood of adjudication decreased within crime categories.  In
other words, in less densely populated counties juveniles were more
likely to have their cases adjudicated as delinquent than in more
densely populated counties, controlling for other characteristics. 

However, burglary and larceny cases heard in metropolitan counties
were more likely to have their cases adjudicated than those heard in
nonmetropolitan counties.  This apparent contradiction may stem from
the fact that within metropolitan counties there may be two classes
of counties in which the outcomes differ.  For example, in the most
densely populated metropolitan counties (e.g., those containing the
central city of the PMSA or MSA), the likelihood of adjudication may
be lowest.  (This accounts for the negative relationship between
population density and adjudication.) Such a relationship would not
invalidate the fact that, on the whole, juveniles in metropolitan
counties are more likely than those in nonmetropolitan counties to
have their cases adjudicated. 

For aggravated assault and drug cases, the length of time before
disposition also had a strong association with the likelihood of
adjudication.  For both of these crimes, the longer it took to
dispose of a case, the less likely it was to be adjudicated. 
However, in aggravated assault cases, the type of attorney had an
effect.  Cases with no attorneys and those with court-appointed
attorneys were less likely to have their cases adjudicated, whereas
in drug cases, there were no differences in the relative likelihood
of adjudication across types of attorneys. 

Other variables having large, positive effects on the likelihood of
adjudication included whether a juvenile was detained (for burglary),
prior record (for larceny), and age (for weapons). 


      PLACEMENT OUTCOMES
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix III:4.2

In analyzing out-of-home placements, we restricted the sample to
cases adjudicated as delinquent.  We estimated equations for the same
crime types as in the adjudication analysis.  In general, we found
that the presence or lack of representation was not associated with
the likelihood of placement for most crime types.  In part, this was
due to the relatively few cases involving unrepresented juveniles
that were placed in the states, especially in California and
Pennsylvania.  For example, in California only 6 of the 2,852 cases
adjudicated for aggravated assault in which a juvenile faced a
placement decision were unrepresented.  In Pennsylvania, only 61 of
1,283 cases adjudicated for burglary in which a juvenile faced a
placement decision were unrepresented.  In general, where there were
sufficient cases to produce a robust estimate of the effect of
representation on placement outcomes, we estimated models that
included representation variables. 

There were exceptions to this general finding of no effect of the
presence or lack of representation on the likelihood of placement. 
Specifically, in California, unrepresented juveniles were three to
five times more likely to be placed, in larceny and drug trafficking
cases, than were represented juveniles.  In Pennsylvania,
unrepresented juveniles were two and one half to three times less
likely to be placed than those who were represented in burglary and
simple assault cases.  In Nebraska, unrepresented juveniles were half
as likely to be placed in burglary cases and about two-fifths in
larceny and one-tenth as likely to be placed in drug cases than were
represented juveniles. 

The influence of the type of attorney on the likelihood of placement
varied across the states.  In California for all crimes except
murder, juveniles represented by court-appointed private attorneys
were more likely to be placed than those represented by private
attorneys or by public defenders.  Juveniles represented by privately
paid attorneys were less likely to be placed than those represented
by public defenders in robbery, larceny, weapons, and drug possession
and trafficking cases. 

In Pennsylvania, for all crimes except robbery, simple assault, and
drug trafficking, juveniles represented by private representation
were from slightly more than one to six times more likely to be
placed (depending upon the crime type) than those represented by
public defenders.  In addition, juveniles represented by
court-appointed private attorneys were one and one half to two and
one half times more likely to be placed than those represented by
public defenders in burglary, larceny, and simple assault cases. 

In Nebraska, juveniles represented by privately paid attorneys tended
to have lower chances of receiving placements than those represented
by public defenders for burglary, larceny, and drug cases. 

A few variables tended to have relatively consistent effects on the
likelihood of placement.  These included whether a juvenile was
detained prior to adjudication, whether charges were changed between
the time of referral and disposition, offense history and court
supervisory status, and the location of the courts. 

In California, for example, for the violent crimes of murder, rape,
robbery, and aggravated assault, the likelihood of receiving
out-of-home placement was highest for juveniles detained prior to
adjudication, as opposed to those not detained.  These juveniles were
from 3.1 to 10.5 times as likely to be placed out-of-home.  The
likelihood was lowest for juveniles whose charges were changed
between referral and disposition.\13

In such cases, these juveniles were 0.08 to 0.38 times less likely to
be placed than those whose referral charges were not changed. 

For the less serious violent crime of simple assault, for property
crimes, such as burglary and larceny, and for weapons and drug
possession the odds of receiving out-of-home placements were highest
for juveniles on ward probation at the time the referral offense was
committed and for juveniles detained prior to adjudication. 
Juveniles on ward probation were from 4.1 to 5.8 times more likely to
be placed as compared with those not on ward probation.  Juveniles
detained were from 2.4 to 3.2 times as likely to be placed as
compared with juveniles who had not been detained. 

In Pennsylvania, across all crime types except rape, detention, prior
dispositions, and population density were consistently among the
variables most likely to influence the likelihood of a juvenile
receiving out-of-home placement.  Juveniles detained, for example,
were from 2.6 to almost 10 times more likely to be placed; juveniles
with priors also were from about 3 to more than 10 times more likely
to be placed than juveniles without priors.  As the population
density of the county in which the juvenile's case was handled
increased, juveniles tended to be less likely to be placed and more
densely populated counties within metropolitan areas--such as the
county containing the central city of the metropolitan area--were
generally less likely to use out-of-home placements than the other
metropolitan counties. 

In Nebraska, across all crime types, prior record, detention prior to
adjudication, location of the court, and the population density of
the county where the court was located were the variables having the
largest impacts on the likelihood of placement.  Juveniles with
priors were from 2 to 6 times more likely to be placed than those
without priors, depending on the type of crime, and juveniles
detained prior to adjudication were generally from 5 to 10 times more
likely to be placed than those not detained. 

In addition in Nebraska, the effects of the location of the court
influenced the likelihood of receiving an out-of-home placement for
aggravated assault, simple assault, burglary, and larceny.  In
nonmetropolitan counties, juveniles who committed these crimes were
less likely to be placed, reflecting, perhaps, the relative scarcity
of placement options.  In addition, as the population density of the
county where the court was located increased, juveniles were more
likely to be placed.  This is consistent with the view that there may
be more placement options in urban areas and that the availability of
these options influences the likelihood of placement. 

Finally, a few other variables had noticeable impacts on the
likelihood of placement in some cases.  For example, in Pennsylvania,
race influenced the likelihood of receiving an out-of-home placement
for rape.  Blacks were 0.044 times less likely than whites and others
to be placed for rape.  Changes (reductions) in charges reduced the
likelihood of placement for rape, robbery and aggravated assault
offenses, but changes in charges had no effect on the likelihood of
placement for property, weapons, or drug offenses.  In California,
race and gender affected outcomes for some crime types. 
Specifically, for drug possession and drug trafficking, blacks were
2.1 and 1.5 times as likely as other persons to be placed.  For drug
possession, males were 2.5 times as likely as females to be placed. 


--------------------
\13 In almost all cases, charges were reduced between referral and
disposition.

<img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">

A recent study has estimated that more than 10 percent of the nation's
youth are engaging in behaviors that seriously jeopardize their futures,
including poor academic performance, substance abuse, delinquency, and
unprotected sex.  One approach for dealing with at-risk
youth--residential care--removes them from where they normally live and
places them in settings ranging from tents in the woods to suburban
homes, where they are taught skills and prepared to return to their
communities and become contributing members of society.   GAO found that
although few rigorous evaluations of residential programs have been
done, the studies issued so far suggest that residential care can
successfully treat some high-risk youths.  Thorough evaluations are
needed to determine which treatments are most effective and what the
long-term effects of the treatment are for youths so that policymakers
can make sound decisions on the most effective mix of programs and the
best role for residential care.  Program officials and other experts
agree that some key elements enhance the programs' ability to alter
high-risk behavior, such as close ties with the youths' families and
continuing support after the youths have left the residential setting
and returned to their neighborhoods.

The Honorable Carl M.  Levin
Chairman, Subcommittee on Oversight of
 Government Management
Committee on Governmental Affairs
United States Senate

Dear Mr.  Chairman: 

The nation faces daunting challenges in deciding how best to approach
the problem of youth whose behavior places them at risk of not
becoming self-sufficient members of society.  One study has estimated
that more than 10 percent of the nation's youth aged 10 to 17 engage
in three or more of the four behaviors most commonly associated with
this risk:  poor performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency,
and early unprotected sexual activity.\1

One approach for dealing with at-risk youth--residential
care--removes youths from where they normally live and places them in
settings ranging from tents in the wilderness to family-like
residences in the suburbs.  In these settings, youths are taught
skills and provided treatment designed to prepare them to return to
their communities and become contributing members of society. 
Because the Subcommittee is interested in the role of the federal
government in providing education, health, and social services to
children living in precarious environments, you asked us to study
residential programs that provide comprehensive long-term help for
youths who are exhibiting multiple high-risk behaviors.  Our study
objectives were to determine

  what is known about the effectiveness of such programs in preparing
     youths to lead self-sufficient, productive lives and

  what can be learned about key program characteristics important for
     mitigating risky behaviors of young people. 


--------------------
\1 Joy G.  Dryfoos, Adolescents at Risk:  Prevalence and Prevention
(New York:  Oxford University Press, 1990). 


   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

Studies indicate that the consequences associated with high-risk
behaviors are costly not only in terms of individual suffering and
diminished quality of life, but also in terms of long-term social
costs and lost productivity.  Some examples follow: 

  On average, each male who drops out of high school will earn
     $260,000 less and pay $78,000 less in taxes during his lifetime
     than those who graduate from high school.  Similar estimates for
     a female dropout were $200,000 and $60,000, respectively. 

  Over 500,000 youths entered detention centers in 1988, and the
     average cost to hold one youth in custody for a year was nearly
     $30,000. 

  Early unprotected sexual activity costs taxpayers an estimated $19
     billion annually for income support, health care, and nutrition
     for families begun by adolescents.  It also increases the
     incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, including acquired
     immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). 

Experts recognize that problems of youths who exhibit multiple
high-risk behaviors are best addressed simultaneously and intensively
over an extended period, in part because problem behaviors are often
interrelated.  For example, some high-risk youths experience problems
in school, become abusers of drugs and alcohol, and become involved
in delinquent activity. 

One way to serve high-risk youth is through comprehensive, long-term
residential programs that remove young people from their homes,
generally for 6 to 18 months.  The programs provide education,
health, and social services to address the youths' multiple problems
in-house or through arrangements with local providers.  Other ways of
addressing youths' problems include nonresidential community-based
programs that serve youths at home or at school or other community
locations. 

The severity of problem behaviors exhibited by youths served in
residential programs varies considerably.  Some youths engage in
high-risk activities, such as drug peddling or prostitution, or
suffer from severe psychological and social problems.  They may be
referred to residential programs by juvenile justice, child welfare,
or mental health organizations.  Other youths are truant from school
or run away from home.  Some who live in crime-ridden neighborhoods
or who come from hostile families need protection.  Parents or social
agencies may refer these youths to residential care programs,
including boarding schools, which provide an opportunity for the
youths to be educated and receive guidance in a safe and stable
environment. 

Many youths in these programs come from low-income homes in troubled
neighborhoods.  Many have been victims of physical and sexual abuse
and have had a number of prior placements such as foster care or
correctional facilities. 


   SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

To examine what is known about the effectiveness of residential care
programs, we searched the literature and contacted experts on the
needs of at-risk adolescents to identify recent studies of program
effectiveness.  We obtained and reviewed relevant studies.  Because
national associations and agencies we contacted could not provide
comprehensive listings of long-term residential programs for youths
aged 10 to 17, we relied on program officials and other experts in
the field to suggest individual programs that, in their opinion, were
notable or had some documented measures of effectiveness. 

In all, we judgmentally selected and contacted 29 residential
programs which, based on information we had at the time, were likely
to meet the following criteria:  served youths aged 10 to 17;
provided long-term, comprehensive services that addressed each of the
four problem behaviors of poor performance in school, substance
abuse, delinquency, and early unprotected sexual activity; and had
recent outcome data on program effectiveness. 

After contacting the 29 programs, we found that 17 met our criteria
and included them in our review.  We also included another program,
the Piney Woods Country Life School, a boarding school that serves
youth who are not currently exhibiting the four problem behaviors,
but who come primarily from dangerous urban neighborhoods where they
may be at increased risk of adopting the behaviors.  Appendix III
lists the names and addresses of these 18 programs. 

We visited 9 of the 18 programs--selected to illustrate a variety of
populations (ranging from youths with relatively minor problems to
those convicted of felonies) and locations (urban, suburban, and
rural).  We conducted telephone interviews with officials of the nine
programs we did not visit to obtain comparable information about
program orientation and outcomes, participant profiles, and funding. 

We used the views of program officials and other experts we contacted
and the literature to develop a list of program characteristics that
appeared to be key to program success.  We then asked officials from
the 18 programs to assess the importance of these key characteristics
to their programs' success. 

We conducted our work between August 1992 and November 1993 in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. 

Appendixes I and II contain descriptions of each program included in
our study and results of evaluations and outcome measurements. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

Residential care appears to be a viable treatment option for some
high-risk youths.  Each of the 18 programs we contacted reported
benefits for some youths in such areas as maintaining attendance in
school and avoiding drug abuse and criminal behavior.  However,
programs seldom conduct controlled or comparison studies to determine
how outcomes are linked to their treatment efforts, and few programs
have conducted studies to show what happened to participants more
than 12 months after they left the programs. 

Not enough is known about residential care programs to provide a
clear picture of which kinds of treatment approaches work best or
about the effectiveness of the treatment over the long term. 
Further, no consensus exists on which youths are best served by
residential care rather than community-based care or how residential
care should be combined with community-based care to best serve
at-risk youths over time.  Many program officials and other experts
we spoke with said that further research is needed into the
effectiveness of residential care and other treatment approaches. 
This could be an appropriate role for the federal government. 

The programs we reviewed differed greatly from one another in such
respects as size, setting, and treatment approach.  Despite these
differences, program officials considered certain characteristics to
be key for success.  These 11 characteristics (see pp.  16-21)
included involving a parent or other concerned adult in the client's
care, placing a strong emphasis on building self-esteem, and planning
for the youth's return to the community after completing the program. 
One of the characteristics that seemed to be particularly important
was an effective link with community-based services that continue to
support high-risk youths and their families after the youths leave
residential care. 


   RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS PROVIDE
   BENEFITS, BUT MORE INFORMATION
   ON THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IS
   NEEDED
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

All programs we contacted reported positive outcomes for some youths,
such as achieving certain educational or employment goals or avoiding
illegal activity after completing the program.  However, few programs
conducted rigorous evaluations to measure effectiveness or long-term
outcomes. 

Program reports ranged from a one-time collection of data to a
rigorous study using a control group.  Programs we reviewed typically
reported outcome data on participants for periods of 12 months or
less after discharge.  None of the studies we reviewed referred to
any specific criteria that could be used to evaluate the results
reported. 

The following examples depict the results reported at 12 months after
discharge: 

  Of 27 participants in the Eckerd Family Youth Alternatives, Inc.,
     Wilderness Educational System, Camp E-How-Kee (Brooksville,
     Florida), who were discharged in the 1991-92 year and for whom
     data were available, 18 (67 percent) had neither dropped out of
     school nor been truant. 

  Of 113 youths released from Boysville of Michigan, Clinton Campus,
     in 1991, 17 (15 percent) were employed full- or part-time, 64
     (57 percent) were unemployed, and the employment status of 32
     (28 percent) was unknown. 

  Of the 52 participants who successfully completed the Starr
     Commonwealth, Cedar Village program (Albion, Michigan) in 1991,
     40 (77 percent) had no record of subsequent arrests.  Twelve (23
     percent) were rearrested, and 8 (15 percent) of them were
     convicted. 

  Of the 30 participants from the KidsPeace National Centers for Kids
     in Crisis, Presidential Treatment Center (Bethlehem,
     Pennsylvania) contacted 12 to 24 months after their discharge in
     1990, 23 (77 percent) were in school or had earned a general
     educational development (GED) certificate. 

Studies of 14 of 18 programs we contacted did not use control or
comparison groups.  We could therefore not determine whether the
outcomes reported were due to the programs' treatments or to other
factors.  However, one program we visited--Father Flanagan's Boys'
Home, Boys Town Home Campus near Omaha, Nebraska--had conducted two
longitudinal studies using a comparison group, and another--New Life
Youth Services, Paint Creek Youth Center in Bainbridge, Ohio--had
conducted a study using a control group. 

Boys Town Home Campus, in two separate studies, compared outcomes for
its youths to outcomes for another group of youths who were referred
to the program during the same period, and met eligibility or
admission requirements, but did not attend.  One study, which looked
at educational attainment and occupational status, found Boys Town
participants outperforming the comparison group on most measures. 
For example, 83 percent of participants had graduated from high
school or obtained a GED, compared to 69 percent of the comparison
group.  The other study, which looked at relations with friends,
family, and supervising adults, found significantly more improvement
over time among Boys Town participants than among the comparison
group. 

Paint Creek Youth Center randomly assigned youths to control and
treatment groups to evaluate its effectiveness as an alternative to a
state correctional facility.  The incarceration rate for Paint Creek
participants 1 year after discharge was 23 percent compared to the
control group's 29 percent.  This difference was not statistically
significant.  However, study investigators commented that, despite
the lack of a statistically significant difference, the Paint Creek
study should lend support to the argument that such programs can be
run as cost effectively as training schools and without undue risk to
the public. 

Information is also limited in two other important areas:  treatment
effects over the long term and the place of residential care in the
continuum of treatment. 

Longer term data are needed to test the endurance of treatment
effects.  Our review of the literature identified a number of studies
that found that some youth leaving residential facilities have a
difficult time maintaining treatment gains.  Five programs we
contacted studied program effects longer than 12 months after
discharge.  One of them--Boysville--found that, for the 317 youths
discharged in 1987 from its residential programs, the cumulative
reimprisonment rate rose from 9 percent in the first year following
discharge to 15 percent in the second year and to 20 percent (a total
of 62 youths) in the third year. 

Information is also limited on the appropriate place of residential
care in the service continuum--that is, which at-risk youth are best
served by residential care rather than community-based care and how
residential care should be combined with community-based care to best
serve at-risk youth over time.  Boysville has been examining the
relative roles of its residential care and community-based programs
in serving at-risk youth and their families and has concluded that
changes should be made in its residential care approach.  Program
officials reported that while they had always believed their program
to be superior, it did not fully meet their high expectations. 
Therefore, they concluded that a radically different approach to
serving clients was needed.  As a result, Boysville officials are
planning to restructure their program by shortening the time youth
spend in residential care and placing increased emphasis on
community-based care. 

Program officials and other experts stated that rigorous studies of
long-term program effectiveness using control or comparison groups
are difficult to conduct.  Specifically, program officials cited the
following barriers to conducting such studies: 

  difficulty tracking youth after they leave the program,

  high cost, and

  reservations about the ethics of withholding treatment from a
     control group. 

Without such evaluations, however, program officials have limited
data to show the specific effects their treatment has had on the
lives of the clients they have served, and policymakers lack
information on whether programs have been a worthwhile social and
economic investment.  Officials from 14 of the 18 programs we
reviewed said studies are needed that (1) are longitudinal and use
control groups, (2) identify youth who would be best served by
residential treatment, and (3) determine whether some youth could be
successfully treated in less costly, less restrictive nonresidential
settings.  Further, some experts suggested that an appropriate
federal role might include supporting effectiveness studies of
residential care and other treatment approaches. 

Experts and program officials cited both advantages and disadvantages
to residential care.  On the positive side, experts with whom we
spoke and the literature we reviewed indicated that residential care
is suited for addressing the needs of some at-risk adolescents
because

  providing comprehensive services, around-the-clock contact with
     clients, and services focused on individual needs can provide an
     effective treatment environment;

  removing clients from dangerous home and community influences can
     provide a safe setting for addressing their problem behaviors;
     and

  establishing a routine and discipline can bring order to what may
     have been fairly chaotic lives. 

On the other hand, our review of the literature suggests that
residential care

  is a restrictive form of care;

  can disrupt youths' attachments because it removes them from family
     and community, which is the setting to which treatment gains
     will have to transfer if positive outcomes are to be sustained
     after discharge; and

  is costly.  For example, 10 of the 18 residential programs we
     contacted cost over $40,000 per youth for a year of treatment. 
     However, not enough is known about the long-term effectiveness
     of residential care, or where it best fits in the continuum of
     services, to determine under what circumstances it may be cost
     effective compared with other types of care such as
     community-based treatment. 


   PROGRAMS VARY IN APPROACH BUT
   SHARE KEY CHARACTERISTICS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

The programs we contacted varied considerably in setting and size,
the types of troubled youth they serve, their treatment approach,
cost, and funding sources.  Program types ranged from a small urban
program that served 8 homeless adolescent girls who had been actively
engaged in prostitution or at risk of doing so, to a large suburban
program on a 1,400-acre campus serving 560 young men and women with a
variety of problems.  Average length of treatment ranged from 6
months to 2 years, with a median stay of 12 months.  Table 1
summarizes selected aspects of the programs we visited, and table 2
shows these aspects for the programs we contacted by telephone. 


The programs served youth with a wide variety of problems, ranging
from felony offenses, such as aggravated assault or burglary, to
truancy and defiance of parental authority.  One program we
visited--Piney Woods Country Life School near Jackson,
Mississippi--primarily served youth who were not exhibiting specific
problem behaviors but, in many cases, came from dangerous urban
neighborhoods.  Two other programs, The Hyde School in Bath, Maine,
and Oasis Center, Michael's Kids House in Nashville, Tennessee, did
not keep records of problem behaviors exhibited by their students
before they came to the program.  With the exception of these three
programs, officials at all others reported that some youth in their
programs exhibited all four risky behaviors--poor performance in
school, delinquency, substance abuse, and early unprotected sexual
activity.  Further, as indicated in figure 1, 10 of the programs
estimated that 50 percent or more of program youths exhibited all
four behaviors. 



                                                                                      Table 1

Notes:
Programs are listed by increasing percentage of youths (left to
right) who exhibited the following four risky behaviors:  (1) poor
performance in school, (2) delinquency, (3) substance abuse, and (4)
early, unprotected sexual activity.

Two of the eighteen programs were unable to provide data on problem
behavior. 

The annual cost of serving one youth ranged from about $20,000 to
about $132,000, with a median cost of about $44,000.  The most costly
programs did not necessarily serve youth with the highest percentage
of risky behaviors.  (See fig.  2.)

   Behaviors

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Notes:
Programs are listed by increasing percentage (left to right) of youth
who exhibited all four risky behaviors.

Annual treatment costs are computed by dividing total program budget
by average population.

Two programs could not provide data on the percentage of youth with
all four risky behaviors.  The annual cost per youth at these
programs are (1) Hyde School, $20,073 and (2) Oasis Center, Michael's
Kids House, $24,321. 

While most programs depended largely on public funding, funding
sources varied considerably.  Fourteen of the 18 programs in our
study received over half of their funding from public sources, and 10
received 90 percent or more.  While most public funds were from state
governments, some of this money included federal funds for foster
care and other purposes that were passed on to the programs by the
states.  Few program officials we interviewed could provide us with
complete information about the portion of public funds for their
programs that originated at the federal level. 

Although programs we studied varied with respect to the severity of
the participants' problems, we found several similarities among
participants' backgrounds.  Twelve of the programs reported that most
youth were from low-income families; seven said most of their
participants came from dangerous or crime-ridden neighborhoods. 
Reported rates of sexual abuse among youths at 15 of the programs
were high, ranging from 30 to 100 percent of the girls and 20 to 70
percent of the boys.  Eleven programs said at least 80 percent of
their youth had previous out-of-home placements, including foster
care, psychiatric hospitals, group homes, and jails. 

Amid the considerable variety of program approaches, program
officials and other experts said that certain key elements were
important for success.  Descriptions of these 11 key elements follow. 


      DEVELOPING INDIVIDUAL
      TREATMENT PLANS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.1

According to program officials, nearly all programs in our study
developed individual treatment plans for each youth.  Plans, in some
cases, are updated at specific intervals, such as monthly.  Often the
youth participate in the planning process by identifying issues they
need to address and in setting goals.  At Starr Commonwealth, Cedar
Village, each youth's plan is discussed in monthly peer group
meetings.  One program official from Boysville noted that if youths
can see their own treatment gains, they will begin to see themselves
as successful. 


      PARTICIPATION OF A CARING
      ADULT
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.2

Important in many youths' successful experiences in such programs,
officials said, was the presence of a caring adult, such as a
counselor or other staff member.  For example, a Boys Town official
told us that his program asserts that all behavioral change can only
take place in the context of a caring relationship--youth will listen
and learn only from adults they believe care about them.  A Starr
Commonwealth official said his program's expectation is that the
trust developed in an adult will extend to other adults after youths
leave the program.  At Boys Town Home Campus and the Salesmanship
Club Youth Camp, staff live with the youths around the clock, 7 days
a week, and are involved in virtually all of the youths' activities. 


      SELF-ESTEEM BUILDING
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.3

According to officials from most programs, it is important for the
programs to provide opportunities to build self-esteem so that youths
can develop a sense of success; two officials told us that the youths
in the programs are accustomed to failure.  Programs build
self-esteem through such activities as sporting events, physical
education, and academics and by teaching practical skills such as
planning and budgeting for household expenditures. 


      PLANNING FOR POST-PROGRAM
      LIFE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.4

Planning for transition from the program may begin as soon as youths
enter the program.  An official from Harbor Schools and Family
Services, Haverhill Program (Haverhill, Massachusetts) said program
officials begin to talk with youths about discharge and arranging
placement even before admission.  After leaving residential programs,
youths are discharged to such settings as their biological families,
foster care, or independent living.  To prepare for the transition,
some programs connect the youths to services in their community and
work with the family to strengthen relationships and resolve problems
such as substance abuse.  During their stay, youths are provided
assistance with career planning, vocational education, and finding a
suitable place to live. 


      TEACHING SOCIAL, COPING, AND
      LIVING SKILLS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.5

One of the most important purposes of residential care is to prepare
youths to function in the everyday world.  To this end, youths are
taught skills such as establishing good work habits, handling
confrontations, and planning and preparing nutritious meals.  Some
youths have never learned how to hold a meaningful conversation
around the dinner table or have never been required to keep their
rooms tidy.  Programs use group activities as well as individual
instruction to develop and enhance these skills.  In some programs,
special events are used to teach practical lessons and skills. 
Youths at the Salesmanship Club Youth Camp, for example, plan and
work together as a group to organize and carry out week-long camping
trips.  Youths at Boys Town Home Campus share a daily family-style
dinner, which they help to prepare, with their house mates and family
teachers (surrogate parent figures who live with the youth on a
24-hour basis). 


      COORDINATION OF SERVICES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.6

Program officials viewed coordination of services as important,
whether the services were provided by a single caseworker or a team. 
At Boysville, Clinton Campus, teams of directors, specialists,
educational coordinators, and others who work with the families track
the academic, social, and family progress of each youth under their
care and collaborate in carrying out treatment goals.  At Boys Town
Home Campus, the family teachers coordinate all services provided to
the youths entrusted to their care. 


      INVOLVING THE FAMILY
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.7

Programs acknowledge that youths' problem behaviors are often related
to family problems and dysfunction.  Several programs we contacted
involve families as part of the formal treatment approach, and three
programs require such participation.  The Hyde School requires
parents to agree to attend certain activities before the school
agrees to admit students.  Parents are required to participate three
times a year with their children at the school in several days of
group discussions and physical challenges, including rigorous outdoor
activities.  The Salesmanship Club Youth Camp requires the parents to
participate in therapy during their child's stay in camp and
encourages the parents to continue therapy for 6 months after their
child's release. 

Programs that involved the family typically had social workers and
therapists work with parents individually, in parent support groups,
and with parents and children together.  Some programs provided
counseling for parents as well as treatment for problems such as
substance abuse.  While nearly all programs we contacted considered
family involvement to be desirable, some said it was not always
feasible.  The program may be too far from a parent's residence or a
family may be unwilling to participate. 


      POSITIVE PEER CULTURE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.8

Peer influence is used to effect healthy behavior changes in youths. 
For example, three programs that serve mostly youths who are
convicted felons use participants' influence on each other to foster
insight and growth.  At all three programs, youths are assigned to
peer groups and conduct nearly all their activities in these groups. 
Staff work with the peer groups to foster desirable values and
behavior patterns.  At Starr Commonwealth, Cedar Village, and
Boysville, Clinton Campus, for example, daily group meetings focus on
a particular experience or problem surfaced by one of the youths from
personal experience.  Youths also initiate impromptu meetings to call
one another to task for negative behaviors. 


      ENFORCING A STRICT CODE OF
      DISCIPLINE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.9

Officials from several programs believed a strict code of discipline
for residents was of great importance.  At The Hyde School, for
example, accountability is the fundamental structure on which the
school's discipline system is built.  Students encourage each other
to report violations of school rules.  If a student knows, but does
not report, that another student has disobeyed Hyde rules, both
students are considered equal offenders and subject to discipline. 


      POST-PROGRAM SUPPORT
--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.10

Twelve of the programs we contacted continue services, such as
counseling and school placement for the youths and family counseling,
after the youths are discharged from residential care.  Of those
programs that do not directly provide aftercare, four told us that
they link the youths and their families with such services in the
community. 

A number of research efforts have suggested that a youth's
environment after discharge is crucial to sustaining the effects of
residential treatment.  For example, a 1966 study of a group of 50
boys who were discharged from the Bellefaire Jewish Children's
Bureau's residential program in Ohio found that successful outcomes
were directly related to the quality of the family environment to
which youths returned after discharge.\2 A 1991 study of youths
discharged from the same residential setting in the mid-1980s
confirmed the importance of post-program support.\3

One program we contacted--The Children's Village in Dobbs Ferry, New
York--conducted a study of aftercare.  This study, now in its ninth
year, is demonstrating the effectiveness of intensive aftercare
provided to a sample of youths (all males, mostly aged 13 when they
entered the program) discharged from the residential program.  The
aftercare included counseling to help participants complete school,
secure employment, and adjust in the community.  The program also
encouraged participants to save money by offering to match what they
had saved.  The comparison group consisted of youths from The
Children's Village whose aftercare was limited to such contact as
bimonthly mailings on job training and education and verbal
encouragement.  Among the findings from the first 6 years of this
study was a 12-percent school dropout rate among the group receiving
intensive aftercare versus a 29-percent rate for the comparison
group.

      PROVIDING A FAMILY-LIKE
      ATMOSPHERE
--------------------------------------------------------- Letter :5.11

According to program officials, because many at-risk youths have not
had the opportunity to grow up in constructive family environments,
several of the programs help youths develop skills and relationships
in a healthy family-like setting.  Use of this approach was
particularly important at Boys Town Home Campus, where the treatment
approach centers around a teaching family headed by a married couple
that acts as surrogate parents.  Teaching parents participate in such
activities as shopping with the youths, taking them to medical
appointments, attending school functions, and helping them with their
homework.  The youths have household responsibilities such as
cleaning their rooms and planning and cooking daily meals.  Similar
to Boys Town, the Bridge Over Troubled Waters Transitional Living
Program in Boston, Massachusetts, operates its program much as a
household would operate, with participants scheduled to shop, cook,
and do other chores on a rotating basis. 

Figure 3 shows the number of program officials citing each key
element as important to their programs' success.  Although 12
programs provide post-program support and considered it to be of
great or moderate importance to their success, four others considered
it important but were unable to provide it.

   CONCLUSIONS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6

While few rigorous evaluations of residential programs have been
done, the outcome studies conducted to date suggest that residential
care can be successful as a treatment approach for some high-risk
youths.  However, limited information is available to draw
conclusions about how residential care can be best applied in the
continuum of services for high-risk youths and their families. 
Additional study is needed to answer such questions as which youth
are best treated in residential settings and which would be better
treated in less restrictive and less costly community-based programs. 
In particular, rigorous evaluations are needed to determine which
treatment approaches are most effective and what the long-term
effects of the treatment are for youths--in residential and other
programs--so policymakers can make sound decisions about the most
effective mix of programs and the best role for residential care. 

Although conclusions cannot be drawn about the success of residential
programs, there appears to be some consensus among program officials
and other experts that certain key elements enhance the programs'
ability to alter high-risk behavior.  Program officials agree that
any effective residential program for high-risk youths should include
such elements as a close alliance with the youths' families whenever
possible as well as continuing support after the youths have left the
residential setting and returned to their community. 

The scarcity of rigorous outcome studies limits the ability of
policymakers to determine whether support for residential programs
constitutes the best use of limited public resources.  Conducting
rigorous program evaluation is expensive and complicated.  However,
without such research, questions will remain about what the most
cost-effective approaches are for treating at-risk youths. 


   MATTER FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE
   CONGRESS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :7

If the Congress decides that the federal government should reexamine
its financial support for programs serving at-risk youth, it should
consider earmarking funds for rigorous evaluations of residential
care and other treatment approaches for this population to determine

  what kinds of programs work best for which youths and

  the appropriate place of residential treatment on the service
     continuum.

PROGRAMS GAO VISITED
=========================================================== Appendix I

The following descriptions of nine programs we visited contain data
obtained from interviews with program officials and written material
they provided.  We did not verify the data--including program costs
and the effectiveness studies and reports.  The methodologies used to
measure program outcomes and the factors they measured varied,
thereby preventing comparison among programs.  Programs are listed in
alphabetical order. 


   BOYSVILLE OF MICHIGAN, CLINTON
   CAMPUS
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1

The program seeks to meet the social, educational, economic, and
spiritual needs of its clients and staff through such means as
providing a community-oriented living and working environment and
maintaining group programs that incorporate peer influence,
individual attention, family involvement, and staff teamwork in an
open setting.  Boysville expects its youth to become more responsible
and to learn to appreciate their own and others' personal worth. 


         SETTING
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.1

The Clinton Campus in Clinton, Michigan, one of Boysville of
Michigan's 13 residential programs, covers 400 acres of mostly crop
land, of which 60 acres are reserved for the treatment program.  The
campus includes dormitories, school and recreational facilities, a
central cafeteria, and administrative offices. 

Boysville of Michigan, Inc., headquartered on the Clinton campus, is
a private, nonprofit child and family service agency serving about
900 clients a year in Michigan and Ohio through its residential,
community, and home-based programs. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTH SERVED IN
         1992
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.2

The maximum capacity of the program was 125; the average population
at a given time was 121.  The total population served was not
provided. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.3

The program serves boys aged 12 and older, 60 percent of whom come
from the Detroit area.  About half are adjudicated delinquents who
would otherwise serve their sentences in the state's training school;
the other half are wards of the state Department of Social Services
and referred because of delinquent conduct.  Clinton accepts the more
severe delinquency cases--referred boys have committed crimes against
property or persons, drug-related offenses, or sexual offenses. 
However, Clinton does not accept boys who are psychotic, who do not
have the mental capacity to participate in the education program, or
who have a history of unprovoked assaults. 

Of the 1992 participants, about two-thirds were African-American and
one-fourth white.  Nearly all of the 1992 participants had at least
one previous placement and 73 percent had single parents.  Based on
disclosures during counseling sessions, staff estimate that 70 to 100
percent of the boys had been sexually abused.  About 70 percent of
the youths served have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poor
performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency, and early,
unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.4

The average length of stay was 1 year; stays ranged from 8 to 16
months. 


         COST PER YOUTH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.5

For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $46,508; for an average stay of
1 year, the cost was $46,508. 


         FUNDING SOURCES
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.6

The following funding sources are for all of Boysville of Michigan,
Inc., including the Clinton Campus. 

                                                                         Percent

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         TREATMENT APPROACH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.7

Boys are assigned to a peer group of about 12, who live, eat, attend
classes, and undergo daily therapy sessions together.  The sessions
are facilitated by a treatment coordinator.  The sessions begin with
each member in turn stating an issue, such as anger management or
victimization, that he's working on at the time.  The group then
decides to focus the meeting on one member, who receives help to talk
through and think about his issue and is offered advice when
possible.  At the end of the meeting, the treatment coordinator
summarizes the discussion and comments on the group dynamics. 

In addition, if at any time a group member feels that someone in the
group is acting inappropriately, he can call a &quot;circle,&quot; meaning the
group members circle around and talk through the issue. 

The treatment coordinator is a member of an interdisciplinary
treatment team responsible for formulating and implementing each
boy's treatment goals and tracking progress.  Family therapy is a key
component of treatment--staff try to involve the family in counseling
sessions, which may continue for up to 6 months after discharge. 

Throughout the program, Clinton staff emphasize four basic values--to
help, respect, trust in, and take responsibility for self and others. 
As boys learn to control their behavior and demonstrate they are
learning the basic values, they are moved along a three-step system
leading to their release.  Boys move from the first step, where they
are expected to need much guidance from their peers and staff, to the
last, where they are expected to do the right thing for the right
reason without relying on rules, staff direction, or peer opinions. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:1.0.8

Routinely collected data.  At 3 and 12 months after departure,
Boysville staff conduct telephone surveys of youths and their
families.  A comparison of some 3- and 12-month outcomes for the 113
youths released from the Clinton Campus in 1991 follows: 

  59 percent were in a setting less restrictive than the Clinton
     Campus at 3 months after discharge; at 12 months, that figure
     was 52 percent.  However, the drop mainly reflects an increase
     in the &quot;unknown&quot; category. 

  The number of boys who were enrolled in school decreased from 53
     percent 3 months after discharge to 46 percent at 12 months
     after discharge.  The decline is due to those who had dropped
     out of school and had not obtained a high school diploma or a
     general educational development certificate. 

Special studies.  No special studies have been conducted specifically
of the Clinton campus.  However, Boysville has done several studies
of its programs' performance in general.  In one study, Boysville
analyzed the imprisonment rates of youth released from its group
homes and campus-based residential facilities in 1985 and 1987. 
Twenty-five percent of those who were tracked for 5 years (1985
cohort) and 20 percent of those who were tracked for 3 years (1987
cohort) were imprisoned in Michigan.  The type of treatment received
(campus-based residential treatment or community-based group home)
and the legal status (child welfare case or delinquency case) were
found to be unrelated to imprisonment rates, but two other factors
were found to be significant:  boys released to their homes,
relatives' homes, or independent living situations were less likely
to be imprisoned, and nonwhite boys who had multiple convictions
before coming to Boysville were more likely to be imprisoned. 

Boysville also analyzed 1982-89 outcome data for its Michigan
residential programs.  Analysts found declines in the percentage of
boys successfully released who were still maintaining a less
restrictive living situation 12 months after release.  Successful
completion means a boy has met all or nearly all of his treatment
goals such as improving academic skills or developing appropriate and
productive relationships.  Of the successful releases in 1982, 68
percent were in a less restrictive setting 12 months after release. 
Of the successful releases in 1989, 54 percent were in a less
restrictive setting 12 months after release. 

Using 1990 data, Boysville also evaluated the cost effectiveness of
two residential programs, a foster care program, and a home-based
program.  Boysville found that the residential programs cost more
than the other programs and resulted in fewer successful releases
than the home-based program--but more than the foster care program. 

With regard to campus-based residential care, these special studies
led Boysville to propose shortening the time boys spend in such care
and provide longer term and more intensive community-based aftercare
for youths and their families.  Boysville plans to assign
campus-based residential care a more limited role in the continuum of
services the agency offers.  Campus-based residential care would be
reserved for those youths who cannot initially be safely treated in
the community (because of potential harm to themselves or others) or
who have already demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to
respond to community-based treatment.  Boysville officials said that,
ideally, youths should be placed in the least restrictive setting
available, such as a nonresidential program, in the continuum of
care. 


   THE BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATERS
   TRANSITIONAL LIVING PROGRAM
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2

The Bridge Transitional Living Program aims to help youth make the
transition from the streets to become fully sustaining members of
society.





         SETTING
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.1

The Bridge Transitional Living Program occupies four floors of a
remodeled rectory in a lower-income Boston residential neighborhood. 
The first floor contains a kitchen/eating area and a living area;
bedrooms are on the upper floors.  Rooms are simple but light and
spacious, and decorations reflect occupants' preferences. 

The program is one of a variety of services provided by Bridge Over
Troubled Waters, a nonprofit organization in Boston.  Bridge's other
services include an independent living program, medical outreach van,
GED program, medical and dental care, a substance abuse counseling
program, and runaway and family counseling. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.2

The maximum capacity for the program was 16; the average population
at a given time was 16.  The total served was 43. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.3

The program serves both men and women ranging in age from 16 through
22; in 1992, 74 percent were under age 20.  The primary reason for
referral to the program is homelessness.  However, about 80 percent
of these youths have been physically abused or neglected and about 40
percent, sexually abused.  Forty percent are white; 40 percent,
African-American; and 20 percent, Hispanic.  About 20 percent of the
youths served have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poor
performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency, and early
unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.4

The average length of stay was 8 months; stays ranged from 6 to 18
months. 


         COST PER YOUTH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.5

For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $22,609; for an average stay of
8 months, the cost was $15,073.  Costs do not include education. 


         FUNDING SOURCES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         TREATMENT APPROACH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.7

The program prepares homeless adolescents to live independently.  The
program coordinator works with each youth to design a specific plan
at intake.  Based on that plan, youths receive individual and group
therapy, medical services, and education at other facilities both
within and outside Bridge.  However, youths return &quot;home,&quot; i.e., to
the Bridge Transitional Living Program, each evening to a full
complement of housekeeping, cooking, and gardening jobs and time with
the peers they come to regard as a family and a support group. 

The house setting, peer group, and program coordinator--who is in
charge of the house and is seen as a parent figure--are much like a
family.  Program officials regard this environment as critical and
see the family setting as enabling youths, who have been largely
isolated, to open up and receive support on hurtful issues. 

In addition to functioning as a parent figure, the program
coordinator also facilitates a Tuesday night meeting, with compulsory
attendance, at which youths review events of the previous week,
including the consequences of their actions on others and on the
effective functioning of the household. 

The program generally does not release youths until they are involved
in a job or vocational program.  Some go on to the Bridge Independent
Living program, perhaps to share an apartment based on a friendship
formed at the Bridge Transitional Living Program.  Bridge recently
began a follow-up group aimed at maintaining youths' contacts with
Bridge after discharge. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:2.0.8

Routinely collected data.  For the 1993 annual report, the Bridge
compiled data on outcomes such as education, living situation, and
work status of 13 youths who were at the Bridge Transitional Living
Program for at least 6 months beginning in September 1991 and had
been out of the program between 1 and 15 months.  The report shows
that

  9 (69 percent) were working full time, two (15 percent) were in
     college full time, and the other two were rearing children who
     were being supported by the children's fathers; and

  11 (85 percent) had earned a high school diploma or GED
     certificate--10 since coming to the Bridge Transitional Living
     Program--and the other 2 (15 percent) were still enrolled in a
     GED program. 

Special studies.  A 1986 report summarized the results of a 2-year
study by a researcher at the University of Massachusetts who
evaluated outcomes of 2 years' participants in Bridge House, the
precursor to the Bridge Transitional Living Program.  The report
examined the program's effectiveness in achieving improved
self-concept and more stable education, employment, and living status
for a group of 16- and 17-year-old youths.  The study reported that
11 youths who had been out of the program an average of 5.7 months
fared significantly better than did a group of 18 youths with similar
backgrounds who were involved in programs other than Bridge's
transitional living program.  For example,

  10 (91 percent) of the program youths were employed, compared with
     eight (44 percent) of the non-Bridge group; and

  7 (64 percent) of the program youths were in school or had
     graduated compared with six (33 percent) of the non-Bridge
     group. 

The Bridge Transitional Living Program is one of 10 study sites
included in a federally funded multiyear transitional living program
study.  The study will gather information--such as living situation,
change in drug and alcohol use, and progress in education--at intake,
6 months later, and 6 months after discharge. 


   FATHER FLANAGAN'S BOYS' HOME,
   BOYS TOWN HOME CAMPUS
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3

The program seeks to provide food, clothing, shelter, medical care,
education, spiritual development, and treatment for the behavioral
and emotional problems of homeless, abused, neglected, and delinquent
youths who require out-of-home placement.  In doing so, it hopes to
give them the skills they need to live in a larger society and lead
useful lives. 


         SETTING
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.1

Boys Town's Home Campus consists of about 1,400 acres in suburban
Omaha, Nebraska.  It contains a high school and middle school,
churches, a hospital, a farm, research and training facilities,
administrative offices, and 76 homes--each of which houses two family
teachers and four to eight youth. 

In addition to the Boys Town Home Campus residential care, Father
Flanagan's Boys' Home provides a variety of services, including
emergency shelters, therapeutic foster care, family preservation, and
parent training.  The organization has used programs developed at the
home campus as models for Boys Town USA sites it has established in
13 cities across the country.  It also provides training and
consultation to other programs and operates a national hot line. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.2

The maximum capacity was 562; the average population at a given time
was 558.  The total served was 847. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.3

Boys Town serves mainly boys and girls who are 13 to 19 years old. 
The average age at admission is about 15.  Most are referred to the
program by social service agencies.  They typically come from
low-income families who live in midwest urban neighborhoods that are
marred by crime and drug problems.  They have an average of two prior
placements such as foster care or group homes, and about 30 percent
have juvenile court arrest records.  Fifty-eight percent are white,
24 percent are African-American, and 18 percent are other minorities. 
Nearly 73 percent of the youth admitted are considered out of control
of parental authority.  Other common problems include vandalism and
theft, verbal aggression, and school learning problems.  Program
officials estimate that about 80 percent of the girls and 35 percent
of the boys have been victims of sexual abuse.  About 60 percent of
the youths served have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poor
performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency, and early,
unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.4

The average length of stay was 18 months; stays ranged from 10 months
to 6 years. 


         COST PER YOUTH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.5

For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $49,279.  For an average stay
of 18 months, the cost was $73,918.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         TREATMENT APPROACH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.7

Boys Town's Family Home Program uses family teachers--specially
trained married couples who live in homes on campus with four to
eight youths on a year-round basis.  The family teachers function in
a role analogous to parents--providing counsel, taking the youths
shopping and to medical appointments, and teaching them how to live
in the family and community.  Family teachers also function as the
primary treatment agents.  They strive to motivate youths to learn
appropriate behavior and reduce destructive behavior, offering both
praise and corrections throughout the day.  They also coordinate the
youths' treatment with other agency service providers. 

As part of a program emphasizing skills needed to operate in family
and societal settings, the program teaches skills to resolve disputes
and solve problems.  Boys and girls are taught to organize their
thoughts and daily activities, participate in family life activities,
negotiate satisfactory relationships with others, and solve problems
rationally. 

Youths are initially placed on a point system on which they earn or
lose points depending on their daily conduct.  Positive points earn
the youths special privileges for the next day and can be accumulated
for larger privileges in the future. 

Boys Town boys and girls attend the campus high school or middle
school whose curricula and teaching methods are designed to address
both academic and social skills that will be relevant in school, in
their home communities, and in employment settings.  Because many
youths are reading several years below their grade levels, Boys Town
has established a Reading Center where youths receive remedial
reading classes and staff conduct research to diagnose and develop
new ways to address reading deficiencies. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:3.0.8

Routinely collected data.  In June 1993, Boys Town began to collect
outcome data on all youths discharged from its programs--including
residential care and family preservation--90 and 180 days after
discharge.  Boys Town social workers are conducting interviews with
the youths and, when appropriate, the families.  Information gathered
includes where the youths are living, their employment history, and
their education status.  Boys Town plans to collate the data in
quarterly reports that will be used to evaluate treatment
effectiveness and modify and improve their programs.  Boys Town also
hopes to compare the cost effectiveness of its residential care and
family preservation programs.  The data collection will be expanded
to include a random sample of youths 1 year after discharge. 

Special studies.  Boys Town has conducted recent studies of its
residential program using comparison groups. 

Boys Town conducted a longitudinal follow-up study of 497 former
residents--who entered Boys Town between May 1981 and June 1985--and
compared their progress with that of a group of 84 youths who had
been accepted to Boys Town during the same time period but who did
not attend.  Participants were interviewed by telephone before,
during, and every 3 to 6 months after their stay at Boys Town.  Final
interviews took place in 1989.  Results indicated that the Boys Town
group did significantly better in such things as rate of graduation
from high school, grade point average, and attitudes about the
importance and chances of attending college.  For example, 83 percent
of the Boys Town youth graduated from high school or completed a GED
certificate, while 69 percent of the comparison group did so. 

Another study conducted by Boys Town compared its 1987-1989
graduates--surveyed in 1990--to a sample of &quot;typical&quot; high school
graduates.  Boys Town graduates were asked about their lives after
program completion, in areas such as employment, post-secondary
education, and church attendance.  Interviewers were able to contact
121 of 193 Boys Town graduates.  Study results showed that Boys Town
youths--who typically have had more behavior and academic
problems--did as well or better than the comparison group in several
areas.  For example,

  93 percent of the Boys Town youths were in school and/or had a job
     compared to 88 percent of the comparison group and

  84 percent of the Boys Town youths reported that they did not use
     drugs other than alcohol, compared to 62 percent of the
     comparison group. 


   THE HYDE SCHOOL
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4

The Hyde School seeks to provide a learning environment in which
individuals develop character and discover a purpose for their lives. 
Originally founded as a more general boarding school, the Hyde School
has an education approach that emphasizes effort over achievement,
which has moved it in the direction of working more closely with
youth with behavior problems. 


         SETTING
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.1

The Hyde School in Bath, Maine, is located on a 150-acre campus--the
former estate of shipbuilder John S.  Hyde.  The original mansion has
been restored and now houses classrooms and faculty offices.  Classes
are also held in a converted carriage house.  The campus includes 6
dormitories for 12 to 24 students each; a sports complex and several
outdoor playing fields; a family learning center for parent weekends
and retreats; and a student union, which contains a performing arts
center, the student/faculty dining room, and a study hall. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.2

The maximum capacity was 200; the average population at a given time
was 195.  The total served was 195. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.3

Hyde students are boys and girls aged 13 to 19.  About 60 percent are
male and 40 percent are female.  Most students are white; about 10
percent are minorities, including Asian, African-American, and
Hispanic.  Most students come from upper-income families and
neighborhoods.  Students come from many states with about 15 percent
of them coming from Maine. 

Most of Hyde's students have a history of family problems.  Primary
reasons for referral are rebelliousness, lack of respect for
authority, and poor performance in school.  About 10 percent of the
students have been in drug rehabilitation programs.  Hyde has an
ongoing program to accept a total of five students selected by the
Boys Clubs of New York City and the Boys and Girls Clubs of
Washington, D.C., based on their potential as students. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.4

The average length of stay was 2 school years; stays ranged from 1 to
5 school years. 


         COST PER YOUTH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.5

For 1 year of treatment (including the Summer Challenge Program), the

         TREATMENT APPROACH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.7

Hyde School is a nonsectarian college preparatory boarding school for
grades 8 through 12.  Most students live in dormitories on campus. 
Each dormitory has a school staff member serving as resident house
mother or father.  Student roommates are matched so that one is an
older student and one is a younger or new student.  Students are
responsible for keeping their rooms clean and for dormitory
maintenance, such as cleaning the bathrooms or vacuuming the living
room.  Students, faculty, and staff eat meals together in the dining
hall.  Students are required to participate in sports and encouraged
to participate in performing arts activities and community service. 

Hyde students are graded on both their academic achievement and their
level of effort in school.  Their effort grade must be at least as
high as their achievement grade to be acceptable. 

Hyde maintains that the first step toward appropriate behavior may be
just going through the motions but that, eventually, the student will
begin to make an effort and finally take responsibility for his or
her success. 

Students are expected to report all inappropriate behavior to staff
and are taught that reporting is an act of caring.  Students
encourage each other to self-report.  However, if a student knows,
but does not report, that another student has broken school rules,
such as by drinking or using drugs, both are treated as equal
offenders.  Students are not expelled for their inappropriate
behavior, but must work on eliminating it. 

Hyde believes that parental participation in the program is
imperative--if the youth is to make permanent life changes, the
parent and family must participate and change as well.  Parents of
Hyde students must attend monthly meetings and a yearly retreat held
in their home regions of the country, a 3-day campus seminar, and
on-campus family weekends in the fall and spring. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:4.0.8

Routinely collected data.  Hyde keeps records of the number of
students who go on to 4-year colleges.  School officials report that
about 90 percent do so.

   NEW LIFE YOUTH SERVICES, PAINT
   CREEK YOUTH CENTER
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5

The program seeks to provide comprehensive, high-quality services
tailored to the individual requirements of youths convicted of
felonies such as aggravated burglary or manslaughter.  The goal is to
change the youths' values so that they can stand up to negative
influences when they return to the community. 


         SETTING
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.1

Located east of Cincinnati on 32 rural acres in Bainbridge, Ohio,
Paint Creek consists of very spartan, barracks-like dormitories and
classrooms, an office building containing a kitchen and dining room,
and a recreational area.  The facility also includes a woodworking
shop, basketball court, playing field, and two tennis courts. 

New Life Youth Services, Inc., a private, nonprofit organization in
Cincinnati, provides a variety of residential and community-based
programs. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.2

The maximum capacity was 33; the average population at a given time
was 28.  The total served was 51. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.3

Paint Creek serves boys aged 15 to 18 at the time of admission. 
These boys, who come from southwest Ohio--principally Columbus,
Cincinnati, and Dayton--have been convicted of a class 1 or 2 felony,
such as aggravated burglary.  Between 50 and 75 percent come from
low-income families, and between 60 and 70 percent are from
crime-ridden neighborhoods.  About 60 percent are white; the rest are
mainly African-American.  Seventy-one percent come from single-parent
families and another 11 percent are reported as having no parent. 

Youths may be referred by the sentencing judge but must pass
screening by the Ohio Department of Youth Services.  Youths accepted
into the program must be able to function in a group and be housed in
a facility that is not physically secured.  The program does not
serve youths who have been convicted of murder nor high-profile
youths such as gang leaders.  About 77 percent of the youths served
have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poor performance in school,
substance abuse, delinquency, and early, unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.4

The average length of stay was 17 months; information on the ranges
of the stays was not available. 


         COST PER YOUTH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.5

For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $35,188.  For an average
17-month stay, the cost was $51,023.  Costs exclude medical costs,
which are billed directly to Medicaid, and education services, which
are provided on site by the local school district.

         TREATMENT APPROACH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.7

Paint Creek uses a combination of therapeutic approaches in a strong
peer culture.  First, boys are required to acknowledge that they have
criminal personalities, which they have to overcome by adopting a new
way of thinking.  Second, they are required to accept responsibility
for their own behavior and--individually and collectively--for their
rehabilitation.  For example, peers (as they refer to one another)
call each other to task for behaviors that reflect &quot;thinking errors,&quot;
such as physical or verbal abuse of others or projecting blame. 

Paint Creek is second only to state correctional institutions in
terms of restrictiveness.  Youths move around the campus single file
with one hand on the shoulder of the youth in front.  During
meetings, one youth is assigned to sit in front of the door to
discourage others from leaving. 

Youths are required to earn their way out of the facility,
progressing through three levels of increasing privilege.  Initially
youths must earn such basic amenities as permission to hang a poster
behind their beds.  Later, youths earn permission to participate in
community service activities and to have personal radios. 
Ultimately, youths earn permission to move around the campus
unsupervised after notifying staff and checking in with staff upon
their return. 

While at Paint Creek, boys attend school.  The curriculum is intended
to parallel the one used in public schools.  The program provides a
special education section and a high school section into which boys
can progress when ready. 

During a period of intensive aftercare, a community services worker
is assigned to the youths as a support person.  Initially, a boy can
leave the house only with the community service worker's permission
and accompanied by a parent, except to go to school, work, or an
appointment arranged by Paint Creek staff.  Gradually, the youth
progresses to increasing freedom of action and less supervision. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:5.0.8

Routinely collected data.  None

Special studies.  A Rand Corporation study of Paint Creek examined
rates of recidivism within 1 year of discharge.  The study compared
75 youths assigned to Paint Creek between February 1986 and April
1988 with a randomly assigned control group serving time at two state
correctional institutions. 

The study found Paint Creek youths had a 51-percent rearrest rate
compared to 61 percent for the control group.  The reincarceration
rate was 23 percent for Paint Creek youths compared to 29 percent for
the control group.  Neither difference was statistically significant. 
The 1993 Rand report suggested that, despite the lack of
statistically significant differences, the Paint Creek study should
lend support to the argument that such programs can be run as cost
effectively as training schools and without undue risk to the public. 


   PINEY WOODS COUNTRY LIFE SCHOOL
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6

Piney Woods' objectives are to strengthen students' reading, writing,
and critical thinking skills; to develop good study habits and a
strong work ethic in each student; and to eliminate the sense of
academic futility and build a sense of academic achievement.  The
school believes that, throughout the United States, there are
students, especially black students, who have the capability to
succeed, but do not have the opportunity to do so for financial or
other reasons. 


         SETTING
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6.0.1

The school is 21 miles southeast of Jackson, Mississippi, on 2,000
rural acres that include woods, lakes, farmland, and 50 acres of
campus.  On the campus are several dormitories, classroom buildings,
a cafeteria, a recreation center, administrative offices, a general
store, faculty and staff homes, and the log cabin that served as the
original school building. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6.0.2

The maximum capacity was 345; the average population at a given time
was 345.  The total served was 345. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6.0.3

Piney Woods is a private school serving male and female boarding
students in grades 7 through 12.  Most students come from low-income
families--many from dangerous urban neighborhoods.  While most
students are not currently exhibiting problem behavior, many students
are at increased risk of academic failure or delinquency and other
personal troubles.  All students are black--about half are from
Mississippi, and the rest are from 22 other states and 3 African
countries. 

To be admitted to Piney Woods, students must have a minimum C-minus
grade average and be in good standing with their current schools. 
They can have no prevailing substance abuse or delinquency problems. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6.0.4

There is no representative average stay.  Some students stay from
grade 7 through high school graduation.  Others begin in grade 11 and
remain 2 years.  The school rarely accepts grade 12 students because
it prefers to have students for more than 1 year.

         TREATMENT APPROACH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6.0.7

Students live in dormitories on campus and are housed two to a room. 
The daily schedule of a dormitory for girls in grades 9 through 12
provides an example of their routine.  Wake-up time is 5:30 a.m.;
room check is at 6:30 a.m.  (beds must be made with hospital
corners); breakfast is at 7:00 a.m.  (all students must be present). 
Students attend classes until about 2:00 p.m.  After school they are
responsible for housecleaning and other chores at the dormitory.  On
weekday evenings, students must do homework from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. 

Students must sign out when they leave the dormitory, saying where
they are going.  They must have a pass signed by the dorm parent if
they are out after 5:00 p.m.  Lights out is at 10:00 p.m.  for grades
9 through 10 and 10:30 p.m.  for grades 11 through 12. 

In addition to their studies and dormitory cleaning responsibilities,
students in grade 7 and above are required to participate in the
student work program 10 hours per week to receive meaningful work
experience and to earn work credit toward tuition charges. 
Assignments include grounds maintenance, working at the souvenir shop
and book store, and working in the administrative offices.  On
Sunday, students are required to attend Sunday school and church
services. 

On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings, there are recreational
activities at the campus recreation center.  These include playing
computer games, swimming, and watching TV and movies.  Parties are
held around holidays. 

The school has strict grooming, dress, and behavior codes.  Students
can be suspended or expelled for such things as failure to attend
class; use of tobacco, alcohol, or drugs; and failure to follow the
dress code. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:6.0.8

Routinely collected data.  The percentage of students who go on to

   SALESMANSHIP CLUB YOUTH AND
   FAMILY CENTERS, INC., YOUTH
   CAMP
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7

The program seeks to provide a wilderness environment in which young
people can experience success and learn problem-solving skills under
the supervision of trained counselors.




         SETTING
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.1

The Youth Camp is located on a 1,250-acre wilderness site east of
Dallas in Hawkins, Texas.  It is organized into three boys' and three
girls' campsites grouped by age and developmental level.  Each group
consists of about 12 youth and has 4 counselors.  Youths build their
own tents with wood floors to serve as living quarters, weekend
kitchen and dining facilities, and bathroom facilities.  The site
includes a school, central dining hall used on weekdays, and
recreational facilities. 

The camp is one of three programs for at-risk youth and their
families that the Salesmanship Club of Dallas operates.  The other
two are a comprehensive day treatment center and school program for
at-risk youth and an intensive outpatient family therapy program,
both in Dallas. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.2

The maximum capacity was 72; the average population at a given time
was 65.  The total served was 158. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.3

The camp serves boys aged 12 to 14 and girls aged 13 to 16 from the
Dallas metropolitan area who are experiencing emotional or behavioral
problems at school or home.  Most boys and girls are white and are
from lower-middle or lower income families.  Typical participants
have problems in school, are substance abusers, and have behavior
problems such as defiance of authority.  Many have been physically
and emotionally abused, and many are suffering from depression. 

To be accepted into the program, youths must have an intellectual
capacity of slow normal to bright, be physically capable of
participating in normal camp routine, and cannot be pregnant or
dependent on drugs.  Boys and girls are generally not accepted if
they have sexually abused other children, are actively psychotic or
suicidal or have parents who disagree on the need for placement or
refuse to participate in therapy.  Most youths are referred to the
program by their parents and are not in the custody of a public
agency.  About 29 percent of the youths served have exhibited all
four risky behaviors:  poor performance in school, substance abuse,
delinquency, and early, unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.4

The average length of stay was 6 months; stays ranged from 4 to 12
months. 


         COST PER YOUTH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.5

For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $25,738.  For the average stay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         TREATMENT APPROACH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.7

Each group of about 12 boys or girls is viewed as an independent
therapeutic community that must work together to meet its needs in
such areas as shelter, food, and emotional support.  Counselors live
with the youth around the clock in the camp setting, with two on duty
at any one time.  The groups design and build their tents and plan
their daily activities, including trips away from the wilderness
site.  They attend school on site for 3 hours a day and return home
at least one weekend a month. 

Difficulties in group interactions, including problem behavior, are
dealt with immediately through &quot;huddle-ups.&quot; In these huddle-ups,
group members help one another address and resolve problems with the
objective of building the social skills and self-esteem needed to be
successful.  Family participation is also an important element of the
program--the youths' families are required to participate in family
therapy in Dallas and are encouraged to continue therapy for up to 6
months after the youths complete the program. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:7.0.8

Routinely collected data.  Cumulative data on campers and their
families are collected routinely and reported in special studies such
as that described below. 

Special studies.  The Salesmanship Club programs have an evaluation
system that--since 1983--has gathered data and reported on the
characteristics of the families and youths served as well as the
impact of services provided.  The current study group consists of 314
youth and families served by the Salesmanship Club's
programs--including 157 discharged from the youth camp--between July
1989 and April 1991.  Youths and families are interviewed at intake,
at discharge, and for several years after leaving program services. 
For a September 1991 report, the program was able to contact and
obtain information from 76 of 133 families at 6 months after
discharge.  While program officials caution that data are not
necessarily representative of all families in the program, they
believe the families who participated in the study are making clear
progress.  For example,

  72 percent of the youths had been receiving special education
     services before they entered the program compared to 29 percent
     receiving them 6 months after discharge and

  family satisfaction ratings were high, with 81 percent of the
     families rating themselves a 5 or 6 on a scale ranging from
     &quot;very unsatisfied&quot; with the program (1) to &quot;very satisfied&quot; with
     the program (6). 


   STARR COMMONWEALTH SCHOOLS,
   CEDAR VILLAGE RESIDENTIAL
   PROGRAM
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8

The program seeks to provide for the care, education, treatment,
counseling, and nonsectarian spiritual guidance of troubled children
and youths.  Its goals are for participants to develop positive
attitudes and values, recognize and reach for their potential,
improve their self-image, increase their self-confidence, and return
to their home communities. 


         SETTING
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8.0.1

Cedar Village is located on Starr Commonwealth Schools' Albion,
Michigan, campus, a 350-acre wooded area in rural south central
Michigan.  The campus includes cottages, school and recreation
facilities, and administrative offices.  Cedar Village is one of
three residential programs on the campus. 

The Albion Campus residential programs served 361 youths in 1992 and
are located on one of three residential campuses operated by Starr
Commonwealth Schools.  In addition to residential care, Starr
Commonwealth also provides community-based services such as an
alternative education program and in-home care.  In 1992, Starr
Commonwealth Schools served 4,950 children, youths, families, and
adults in Michigan and Ohio. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8.0.2

The maximum capacity was 57; the average population at a given time
was 58.  The total served was 121. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8.0.3

The program serves boys, aged 14 to 18, largely from low-income,
single-parent families living in poor communities in eastern
Michigan, from the upper peninsula down through the Detroit area. 
All youths entering the program are delinquents, typically with
multiple felony convictions such as breaking and entering, assault,
motor vehicle theft, and drug sales.  Of the 83 youths released in
1992, 53 percent were African-American, and 34 percent were white. 

Most boys in the program have had previous placements, usually in
youth homes.  Of the youths released in 1992, 64 percent have a
substance abuse problem, about 36 percent have experienced physical
abuse or neglect, and 50 to 60 percent have been sexually abused.  To
be accepted by the program, boys must be able to socialize in a group
and, among other things, not be highly violent or chronically truant. 
About 70 percent of the youths served have exhibited all four risky
behaviors:  poor performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency,
and early, unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8.0.4

The average length of stay was 10 months; stays ranged from 7 to 14
months.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         TREATMENT APPROACH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8.0.7

Typically a boy begins his stay by taking educational and
psychological tests.  Staff use the test results with other input
such as staff observations to develop the boy's individual growth
plan.  Based on vacancies in cottages and on the boy's compatibility,
he is then assigned to a peer group of 10 to 12 boys within a
cottage.  Seven staff are assigned to each cottage.  Except for
individual counseling or medical treatment, the boys live, eat,
attend classes, and undergo therapy with their peer group. 

Through the group process and under the guidance of staff counselors,
the boys develop a sense of self-worth and learn to take care of
themselves and others.  Once the peer group is satisfied that a boy
has dealt with the group's feedback on his problems and is resolving
them, the group makes the initial recommendation that he is ready for
release.  Staff consider the group's recommendation in deciding
whether a boy has achieved the goals in his growth plan and is ready
to return to the community. 

Staff maintain contact with the boy's family throughout the program. 
When the boy arrives at Cedar Village, staff counselors and a family
service worker immediately begin working with the family to develop a
post-placement plan.  The goal is to create a supportive environment
for the boy once he is discharged.  Counselors and the service worker
may hold family conferences to strengthen family relationships or
address problems such as substance abuse in the family.  Families are
encouraged to visit the campus, where apartments are available for
their stay. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:8.0.8

Routinely collected data.  Starr Commonwealth Schools collects data
on outcomes at 3 and 12 months after discharge.  A comparison of some

   YOUTHCARE, THRESHOLD PROGRAM
--------------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9

The program is designed to help young women leave street life by
providing a safe, stable place to live, a stable source of income,
effective role models, and some resolution of family issues. 
Threshold's goals include helping the women to work and live
effectively in their current situation and to be prepared for their
future role as adults. 


         SETTING
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.1

Threshold uses a number of residential settings in and around
Seattle, Washington, for its three-phased program.  Phase I is
located in a shelter for runaway youth.  The shelter, a brick house
in an urban neighborhood, has six bedrooms and is close to bus lines. 
A licensed group care home in Seattle serves as the phase II
residence.  During phase III, girls aged 18 and older live
independently, such as in their own apartments, while younger girls
live with foster families. 

YouthCare, a Seattle-based private, nonprofit agency, provides
residential programs and counseling, education, and medical care and
other services to meet the needs of youth in crisis in the local
community. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.2

The maximum capacity was eight (four in phase I and four in phase
II); the average population at a given time was six for phases I and
II.  The total served was 10. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.3

Threshold serves girls aged 14 to 18 who have been physically,
sexually, or emotionally abused or neglected and who have histories
of prostitution or are at high risk of becoming involved in
prostitution.  Girls come from low-income families in the county and
usually have had prior placements or interventions such as foster
care and family counseling.  All girls are referred by state child
protective services.  Of the 1992 participants, six were white, three
were African-American, and one was Native American.  Girls accepted
into the program must be motivated to stop such behaviors as abusing
drugs or alcohol, engaging in prostitution, or assaulting others. 
About 75 percent of the youth served have exhibited all four risky
behaviors:  poor performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency,
and early, unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.4

The average length of stay was 7 months for phase I plus 12 months
for phase II; stays ranged from 3 to 8 months for phase I and from 12
to 16 months for phase II. 


         COST PER YOUTH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.5

For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $28,927; for the average stay
of 19 months, the cost was $45,802.  Costs cover phase I and II only. 
Local school districts pay for the education of girls who attend
district schools.  Phase III services are funded by YouthCare
unrestricted funds and not by the Washington state grant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         TREATMENT APPROACH
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.7

Phase I, which is very structured, is designed to stabilize the
girls' behavior and allow staff to assess individual needs and
develop a trusting relationship with the girls.  Initially, the girls
must stay in the house except to attend school and go on occasional
outings with other residents and staff.  The girls must sever all
ties with their former associates.  They are also expected to attend
individual counseling sessions with their Threshold caseworker,
pursue at least a GED certificate through local schools or programs,
learn job-finding skills, find jobs if they are old enough, and
perform household chores.  Many residents for the first time learn
how to clean their rooms, wash laundry, prepare meals, budget, and
shop.  The girls must demonstrate cooperation, motivation, and
responsibility to earn privileges such as 1-hour walks or overnight
stays with friends or relatives.  Girls attend a weekly meeting where
they may discuss problems arising from communal living or any topic
of interest to the group. 

After demonstrating they have the skills to live in a
semi-independent manner, girls graduate to phase II.  The phase II
group home operates as a family home, allowing the girls to earn the
right to be alone in the house, carry keys, and have friends over. 
In addition to pursuing education and employment goals, girls
continue to care for themselves, taking on more responsibility for
cleaning and meals.  Because many of the girls missed the opportunity
to participate in, and learn from, recreational activities while they
were growing up, the program provides many activities such as camping
and visits to local parks. 

In phase III, girls move to independent living situations or
supportive foster care homes where they continue to receive support
and care from Threshold staff for 6 months to a year or more. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
----------------------------------------------------- Appendix I:9.0.8

Routinely collected data.  None

Special studies.  Six months after they left Threshold's phase II, 24
girls who had entered phase II between January 1987 and July 1989
were assessed by YouthCare.  YouthCare found 10 girls (42 percent)
were living in a stable situation, employed or attending a school or
vocational training program, and were free of substance abuse and
involvement in crime.  Eight girls (33 percent) had returned to
street life or were abusing drugs, and no information was available
on 6 girls (25 percent) who could not be contacted.

   THE CHILDREN'S VILLAGE,
   TOMPKINS TRANSITIONAL CARE
   PROGRAM
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1

The program provides comprehensive services to the most at-risk
segment of the Children's Village population to move youth
successfully to a less restrictive Children's Village or other
program.



         SETTING
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.1

The Tompkins program is located on the Children's Village campus in
Dobbs Ferry, New York.  It is housed in a single cottage at the
center of an ellipse of 21 residential treatment cottages, which are
divided into seven &quot;neighborhood&quot; units. 

The Children's Village has provided residential care for children
since 1851.  Currently, in addition to its campus-based residential
treatment, it provides community-based group homes for boys, and
foster family care homes for boys and girls. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.2

The maximum capacity was 12; the average population at a given time
was 12.  The total served was 15. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.3

Tompkins serves boys aged 8 to 15.  All have had previous placements: 
approximately half are in the next stage of their recovery after
release from a mental hospital; and the other half are referred from
other Children's Village programs where their behavior has suddenly
deteriorated due to some trauma.  Their specific problems include
conduct disorder, lack of impulse control, depression, episodes of
violence, attention deficit disorder, hyperactivity, or being a
danger to themselves or others.  All are from New York state,
principally New York City and nearby counties, and are referred by
the New York Department of Social Services.  Tompkins excludes boys
for whom a less restrictive approach would be appropriate. 

All come from families whose income is below poverty level.  About 20
percent are reported as having no parents; the remaining 80 percent
are from single-parent families.  Between 60 and 70 percent have been
sexually abused and 90 percent have been physically abused or
neglected.  About 10 percent of the youths served have exhibited all
four risky behaviors:  poor performance in school, substance abuse,
delinquency, and early, unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.4

The average length of stay was 15 months; stays ranged from 6 to 24
months. 


         COST PER YOUTH
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.5

For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $65,496; for an average stay of
15 months, the cost was $79,141.  This included all costs except
fundraising and investment counseling fees and education, which is
provided by an on-campus public school.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         TREATMENT APPROACH
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.7

Tompkins is the most intensively staffed of the Children's Village
residential treatment cottages, providing around-the-clock coverage
by therapists trained to use the living environment as a treatment
tool.  Tompkins' higher staff-to-youth ratios and more intensive
clinical services allow treatment of youth who would otherwise
require psychiatric hospitalization. 

As with other Children's Village programs, cottage life is important
to the Tompkins program.  To provide a firm structure that
establishes boundaries of behavior, cottages have clear rules as well
as clear consequences for breaking them. 

Each boy has a primary case manager and must sign a contract that
commits to specified behaviors.  A daily checklist reports and
rewards acceptable behavior.  Group therapy uses life events to teach
appropriate behavior.  The program uses special events such as
carnivals, circuses, and art fairs to develop youths' skills and
thereby enhance their self-esteem. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1.0.8

Routinely collected data.  None

Special studies.  No special studies have been conducted specifically
of the Tompkins program. 

One study, which has aftercare as a principal component, is under way
for selected participants of Children's Village.  This study, now in
its ninth year, examines a program called Work Appreciation for
Youth, which involves intensive counseling, work ethics education,
and financial incentives for saving money. 

Work Appreciation for Youth participants--who are about 80 percent
minorities and are all academically deficient--receive these services
both while at Children's Village and after discharge.  The study
tracks the performance of 65 of these participants and compares it to
another group of youths who did not participate in the Work
Appreciation for Youth program while at Children's Village--and who
received less intensive aftercare services. 

Based on data from the first 6 years of the study, youths who have
remained in the Work Appreciation for Youth program have
significantly outperformed the comparison group with respect to not
dropping out of school, completing high school, and earning some
money.  For example,

  40 percent of the Work Appreciation for Youth participants have
     graduated or received a GED certificate, compared to 18 percent
     of the comparison group; and

  12 percent of the Work Appreciation for Youth participants have
     dropped out of school, compared to 29 percent of the comparison
     group. 


   EASTERN NEBRASKA COMMUNITY
   OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH
   ADOLESCENT TREATMENT FACILITY
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2

The program aims to make boys more self-aware and more controlled in
behavior and emotions.  The intent is that they be reunited with
their biological families, if available, or with surrogate families
or placed in other long-term or permanent situations.





         SETTING
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.1

The Adolescent Treatment Facility is in a large group home in a
residential neighborhood in Omaha, Nebraska.  It has its own fenced
black-topped tennis/basketball court. 

The facility is one of three long-term residential treatment
facilities that the Eastern Nebraska Community Office of Mental
Health operates within a service spectrum that also includes
emergency short-term care, therapeutic foster care, and home-based
mental health services to children and adolescents.  In addition, the
agency provides residential and day rehabilitative services for
adults. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.2

The maximum capacity was 8; the average population at a given time
was 8.  The total served was 14. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.3

This program provides around-the-clock treatment and care for boys
aged 12 to 19 with diagnosable psychiatric disorders--such as major
depression or conduct disorder--for whom a less controlled treatment
setting is not considered appropriate.  Boys must have sufficient
intellectual potential to respond to active psychological treatment. 
They are referred by the Nebraska Department of Social Services, but
most have been charged as delinquents and have plea bargained to a
less serious charge with the understanding that noncooperation could
result in their being placed in the corrections system.  All have
been through a psychiatric hospital and received a recommendation
against their return home. 

Ninety-nine percent of the boys' families are below the poverty
level, and 80 percent are single-parent families.  About 90 percent
of the boys come from the Omaha metropolitan area.  Almost all of the
youths served have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poor
performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency, and early,
unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.4

The average length of stay was 9 months; stays ranged from 5 to 12
months. 


         COST PER YOUTH
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.5

For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $24,740; for an average stay of
9 months, the cost was $18,555.  These figures include all costs
except administrative and school costs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         TREATMENT APPROACH
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.7

The first day a boy is in the program, staff develop an interim
treatment plan; 2 weeks later, staff develop a comprehensive plan
with the participation of the boy, his family, and his Department of
Social Services caseworker.  Others whom the family and youth
identify as important are also invited to participate.  The program
identifies the boy's and family's strengths and weaknesses, and uses
an individualized approach to provide encouragement for the boy to
build on identified strengths.  Efforts include working to empower
the boy by teaching social, coping, and living skills--thereby
boosting self-esteem. 

To produce changes in behavior, the program uses a system of tokens
and positive reinforcement for good behavior.  By accumulating
tokens, boys can progress to a higher level in the program in which
they are permitted to engage in more independent actions as they
demonstrate increased skills and self-control. 

Criteria for returning youths to their families include improvement
of family dynamics, communication, and understanding so that the
family can function as an effective unit. 

The treatment plan identifies strengths and weaknesses of the boy's
family and sets goals and objectives with time frames--for example,
to improve family communications or to teach parents to use
incentives for good behavior instead of punishment for inappropriate
behavior.  The program conducts weekly meetings with parents and
helps the family identify and link with community supports that will
provide family survival skills. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2.0.8

Routinely collected data.  Other than monitoring changes in youths'
scores on a standardized test of child behavior over the course of
the program, Eastern Nebraska collects data on a single outcome--the
setting to which boys are discharged.  The program was able to
contact 10 boys who were discharged in 1991: 

  Of the five who were contacted 12 to 18 months after discharge,
     none was in a correctional institution, one was in another
     residential placement, and four were living with a biological
     parent. 

  Of the five who were contacted 18 to 24 months after discharge,
     three were in a correctional institution and the other two, in
     foster care.

   UNITS
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3

This program's intent is to help youth improve their social,
emotional, and behavioral functioning and move successfully to a less
restrictive setting.





         SETTING
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3.0.1

The Subacute Residential Services program is housed in three cottages
on a campus in Los Gatos, California.  The cottages are family style,
with central living rooms and kitchens.  The campus also includes a
gym, an activity room, a swimming pool, a playing field, climbing
equipment, and a jogging trail. 

In addition to residential care, Eastfield Ming Quong operates a
variety of child and family mental health programs in Santa Clara
County, California, including child and adolescent in-home treatment,
a family clinic, and school-based day treatment. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3.0.2

The maximum capacity was 30; the average population at a given time
was 24.  The total served was 36. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3.0.3

The program serves boys aged 10 to 15 with serious psychiatric
disorders, ranging from depression to medically controlled psychosis,
or major learning handicaps such as attention deficit disorder. 
Approximately 70 percent are referred by the California Division of
Family and Child Services, 20 percent by the county mental health
emergency center, 6 percent by the schools, and 2 percent each by
health care facilities and family members. 

About 73 percent of these boys are white; 15 percent, Hispanic; 8
percent, African-American; and 4 percent, Asian.  Their family
incomes average $9,500, with 92 percent below the poverty level. 
About 62 percent are from single-parent families.  Family problems
include domestic violence and drug and alcohol problems.  Youths come
from Santa Clara County, California--generally from low-income
sections with high crime rates, some gang activity, and poor housing. 
About 35 percent of the youths served have exhibited all four risky
behaviors:  poor performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency,
and early, unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3.0.4

The average length of stay was 15 months; stays ranged from 12 to 18
months. 


         COST PER YOUTH IN 1992
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3.0.5

For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $132,493; for an average stay
of 15 months, the cost was $165,616.  These figures include all
direct and indirect costs except education.  According to program
officials, costs also reflect high staff-to-youth ratios required by
the state licensing agency and by the rate classification system for
group homes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         TREATMENT APPROACH
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3.0.7

Treatment is based largely on using activities and relationships of
daily living as opportunities for addressing individual problems. 
Each cottage houses 8 youths and has a primary therapist who is
responsible exclusively for youths in that cottage.  Boys spend
after-school hours and weekends largely with the residents of their
cottage.  The therapist is responsible for developing and
coordinating the treatment plan for each youth.  The plan is woven
into all aspects of the program:  individual therapy, group therapy,
recreational activities, family therapy, and--in coordination with
the community schools the youth attends--educational program. 

Throughout its activities, the program uses a system that holds boys
responsible for achieving their behavioral goals and rewards positive
behavior with points that accumulate to earn promotion through four
levels to discharge. 

Eastfield Ming Quong also attaches importance to family counseling,
though family participation is not a requirement.  Family therapy
sessions occur once each week with the youths included at the
discretion of the primary therapist. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3.0.8

Routinely collected data.  The program collects data on a single
outcome:  the setting to which boys are discharged.  For the 139
youth discharged during 1991 and 1992, 78 percent were discharged to
a lower level of care--such as a parent, relative, community group
home, or a foster home; 16 percent were discharged to the same level
of care; and 6 percent were discharged to a higher level of care (a
psychiatric hospital).

   E-HOW-KEE
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4

The program focuses on direct, daily care that promotes children's
self-esteem, interpersonal competence, success in school, and
positive involvement with family and community.  The aim is to assist
children in developing appropriate social competencies, personal
values, and self-management skills that can be successfully
transferred to their home, school, and community setting.



         SETTING
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4.0.1

Camp E-How-Kee in Brooksville, Florida, is in a wilderness area in
the central part of the state.  It is 1 of 19 programs operated by
Eckerd Family Youth Alternatives, Inc., of Clearwater, Florida. 
These programs, which serve youth from seven states, include 13
wilderness camps, a juvenile correctional facility, a short-term
residential program for less serious offenders, and the Florida
Conservation Corps. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992

was 56.  The total served was 110. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4.0.3

Camp E-How-Kee serves boys aged 10 to 16 from the central Florida
area.  They are primarily status offenders or truants.  The boys
typically come from lower-middle-income urban families with a history
of child abuse, substance abuse, and marital problems.  Most boys are
referred by the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitation
Services.  About 60 percent have been victims of sexual abuse.  All
youths have had multiple failures in other treatment programs or
out-of-home placements such as foster care, short-term residential
psychiatric hospitals, and counseling.  Of the 1991-92 participants,
about 52 percent have received court judgments, with an average of
three convictions; 19 percent of the judgments were for crimes
against persons.  Eighty-five percent are white, 12 percent are
African-American, and 3 percent are Hispanic.  Almost all of the
youths served have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poor
performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency, and early,
unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4.0.4

The average length of stay was 13 months; stays ranged from 9 to 15
months. 


         COST PER YOUTH

         TREATMENT APPROACH
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4.0.7

Boys in the program live in a wilderness setting in small groups of
peers and counselors.  The groups construct their own shelters, cut
their own wood for cooking and heating, make needed repairs, and
provide their own recreation.  The program is designed to increase
the boys' feelings of self-worth by developing the skills they
acquire in providing for their own basic needs and by seeing how many
&quot;luxuries&quot; they can do without and still be content and comfortable. 

Within these groups--through daily routines and special
activities--boys are taught to identify and resolve problems.  Each
boy pursues an individual education plan that places priority on
listening, speaking, writing, and reading.  While the boys are in
camp, parents are required to participate in parent therapy groups,
attend three family conferences yearly at the camp, and maintain
contact with Eckerd family workers.  Youth make home visits for 4
days every 6 weeks to give them and their families a chance to
practice new skills. 

The parent organization, Eckerd Family Youth Alternatives, Inc.,
provides aftercare services for up to 6 months to maintain and build
on the gains made at the camp.  Aftercare includes identifying
individual needs, such as counseling or care for chronic health
problems, and helping families contact appropriate community service
agencies.  A program family worker continues to work with the youth
and families through frequent face-to-face contact supplemented by
phone calls. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:4.0.8

Routinely collected data.  At 6 and 12 months after discharge, the
program collects outcome information.  At the time of our study, the
program had 12-month data on 33 of the 42 boys discharged in fiscal
year 1992.  The data showed the following: 

  Delinquency:  18 (55 percent) had no further encounter with the law
     while 15 (45 percent) had--resulting in such actions as
     commitment to a secure residential program or being put on
     probation. 

  Education:  9 (27 percent) were truant or had dropped out of
     school. 

  Living status:  59 percent (17 of the 29 for whom the program had
     this data) were living with their natural or adoptive families;
     the remainder were in placements such as foster care and group
     homes. 

Special studies.  No special studies had been conducted for Camp
E-How-Kee.  However, the Eckerd Wilderness Education System is
conducting a 3-year longitudinal study of 250 campers--50 from each
of 5 camps other than E-How-Kee--beginning with campers entering in
May 1990.  Data will be collected for the period before the youths
entered the program, during the program, and 3 years after.  The
preliminary report issued in June 1992 reported gains made by youth
at the time of discharge in academics, family functioning, behavior,
and self-esteem. 


   HARBOR SCHOOLS AND FAMILY
   SERVICES, HAVERHILL PROGRAM
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:5

The immediate tasks are to break the cycle of failure, stop the
victimization of self and others, and bring order to chaotic lives. 
The goal is to stabilize the participants' behavior and move them
back with their families or to less restrictive programs.


         SETTING
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:5.0.1

Haverhill Residential Facility is in a restored 19th-century house in
a residential neighborhood of Haverhill--a small city 35 miles north
of Boston. 

Harbor Schools and Family Services operates a variety of youth and
family service programs in several locations in Massachusetts.  In
addition to residential care, they include short-term (30-day
maximum) crisis resolution residential programs, day programs such as
special education and group therapy, and community services such as
family preservation and support services for teen parents. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:5.0.2

The maximum capacity was 16; the average population at a given time
was 15.  The total served was 22. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:5.0.3

Harbor Schools' Haverhill facility serves girls aged 13 to 16 at
admission.  About 80 percent are from families with incomes below the
poverty level.  These families live mainly in poor urban or suburban
areas in New England--primarily in Massachusetts.  Forty-eight
percent of the girls are white, 19 percent are African-American, and
20 percent are Hispanic. 

The girls display an array of unmanageable behaviors, including
disruptiveness, sexual promiscuity, habitual truancy, and drug abuse. 
Most are in Haverhill because of a status offense.  Nearly all have
been victims of physical and sexual abuse, and 90 percent show signs
of chronic malnutrition and lack of regular medical care.  Most
suffer from depression and feelings of isolation.  About 5 percent
are psychotic and have been sent to Haverhill instead of mental
institutions.  All have had previous placements and average about
five--mostly in foster care.  About 90 percent of the youths served
have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poor performance in school,
substance abuse, delinquency, and early, unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:5.0.4

The average length of stay was 1 year; stays ranged from 3 to 24
months. 


         COST PER YOUTH

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         TREATMENT APPROACH
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:5.0.7

Harbor's Haverhill program treatment is designed to provide a highly
structured environment in which girls receive reinforcement for
positive behavior.  The program uses an 86-point behavior checklist
as part of its comprehensive behavior management system.  Girls are
taught new skills for dealing with anger, anxiety, and frustration. 
Each girl progresses at her own pace from one level of the program to
the next less restrictive level. 

Girls receive individual therapy each week from private clinicians
and also attend group counseling sessions supervised by staff and
clinicians.  These group sessions serve in part to allow the girls to
make decisions about the daily operations of the program.  Every girl
has an individual education plan and attends small classes of four to
eight students on the program premises.  They also receive training
in practical life skills.  They can join a work-study program, and
some hold down after-school and weekend jobs. 

All girls are involved in the recreation program, which includes
sports, crafts, camping, scouting, and local movies.  Family
involvement takes place through parental support groups and
individual contacts with a staff caseworker who provides information
about the girls' progress and about techniques for better parenting. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:5.0.8

Routinely collected data.  None

Special studies.  No studies have been conducted exclusively of the
Haverhill program.  However, in 1989 the Harbor Schools' executive
director conducted a one-time survey of 20 youths who had been
discharged from Harbor programs--including Haverhill--over a period
of 2 years.  The survey found that, 3 months after discharge, 14 (70
percent) of the youths had returned to school, family life, and
part-time work. 


   HILLSIDE CHILDREN'S CENTER,
   RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT CENTER
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:6

The program's goal is to provide comprehensive, high-quality child
welfare, education, juvenile justice, and mental health services
based on the needs of children and their families.  The program aims
to achieve each youth's individual treatment goals and a smooth
transition from residential care back to their families, communities,
and schools. 


         SETTING
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:6.0.1

The Residential Treatment Center cottages are in an urban
neighborhood of Rochester, New York, on a campus with several
programs, including Hillside Children's Center school and emergency
shelter. 

The residential center is one of 20 programs operated by Hillside
Children's Center.  Others include two psychiatric residential
treatment centers, day treatment programs, intensive family support
programs, and therapeutic foster homes. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:6.0.2

The maximum capacity was 48; the average population at a given time
was 48.  The total served was 100. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:6.0.3

The Residential Treatment Center serves boys and girls mainly aged 6
to 17 from lower-income urban neighborhoods in New York state,
largely in Rochester.  Sixty-five percent are white, and 25 percent,
African-American.  Nearly half of the youths come from families with
a history of physical violence, and 27 percent come from families
with an adult alcohol abuser.  Youths admitted are unmanageable or
unable to function safely in the home or school setting.  The program
avoids admitting youth with severe violent behavior and active
substance abuse problems.  Less than 5 percent of the youths served
have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poor performance in school,
substance abuse, delinquency, and early, unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:6.0.4

The average length of stay was 12 months; stays ranged from 6 to 20
months. 


         COST PER YOUTH

         TREATMENT APPROACH
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:6.0.7

Upon admission to the Residential Treatment Center, boys and girls
are assigned to one of three residential cottages.  They live with
about 15 other youth of the same sex and similar age.  In the cottage
setting, staff teach youth independent living skills and monitor
their behavior.  The staff give points to the youths as part of a
reward system for appropriate behavior.  Youth attend Hillside's
campus school and, in addition to psychiatric and psychological
services, receive specialized services such as recreation, art, and
dance therapy. 

The program is designed to work with family members in planning
treatment for their child and for themselves.  The family meets with
their child's social worker and program treatment team and is offered
assistance with and referral to other services as needed.  After
discharge, the residential center offers continuing counseling
services for 6 months to help the youths make the transition to
community life. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:6.0.8

Routinely collected data.  The program gathers data on discharge
status such as whether youths leave Hillside for a more or a less
restrictive setting and the degree to which each youth's individual
treatment goals have been met.  It reported that in 1992 there was a
slight improvement over 1991 in the rate of achievement of these
goals at the time of discharge. 

Special studies.  None


   KIDSPEACE NATIONAL CENTERS FOR
   KIDS IN CRISIS, PRESIDENTIAL
   TREATMENT CENTER
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:7

The program tries to teach life skills, develop self-discipline, and
foster respect for authority as well as individual rights.  The goal
is to enable the youths to function independently with behavior
appropriate for their age and to facilitate their return to a less
restrictive environment.



         SETTING
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:7.0.1

The Presidential Center consists of a complex of seven cottages in
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  The program is one of several KidsPeace
programs that share a campus in a residential section of a suburban
community.  The campus includes a large gymnasium, swimming pool, and
other recreational facilities. 

KidsPeace National Centers for Kids in Crisis, a 111-year-old
organization, operates additional long-term residential treatment
facilities, a psychiatric hospital, and various other treatment
facilities at sites in Pennsylvania, Indiana, and New England. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:7.0.2

The maximum capacity was 103; the average population at a given time
was 97.  The total served was 150. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:7.0.3

The program serves boys aged 8 to 18 and girls aged 10 to 13 and 16
to 18 (girls aged 14 to 15 are served in another KidsPeace program). 
In 1992, 75 percent were male and 25 percent, female; 79 percent were
white and 18 percent, African-American.  About half of the youths'
families receive some form of public assistance, and half are
single-parent families.  Approximately 70 percent of the boys and
girls are documented sexual abuse victims. 

Seventy percent of the youths are from suburban or rural communities. 
The program draws participants from the 26 states east of the
Mississippi River, with 40 percent coming from Pennsylvania. 

Ninety-two percent of the youths are referred by a state department
of social services, which may include court referrals.  Eight percent
are private referrals with third-party insurance.  Between 80 and 90
percent have been in a previous placement. 

The program does not accept youths with an intelligence quotient of
less than 70 or with histories of homicide or aggravated assault. 
Nor does the program accept youths who are heavily involved in street
gangs or severely psychotic or schizophrenic.  About 50 percent of
the youths served have exhibited all four risky behaviors:  poor
performance in school, substance abuse, delinquency, and early,
unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         TREATMENT APPROACH
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:7.0.7

After giving extensive psychological and psychiatric tests to an
entering youth, interdisciplinary program staff work together to
develop a highly individualized treatment plan, which is updated
monthly, and a discharge plan for the youth within 15 days of
arrival.  An individual counselor and a therapist manage
implementation of the plan.  In a highly structured environment, the
program sets out basic expectations, rules, and consequences of
breaking the rules.  These consequences are enforced by a counselor
assigned to the youth.  Youths live in cottages where the environment
is designed to nurture and provide support.  They receive weekly
individual and group counseling and regular reviews of their progress
under the supervision of a staff psychiatrist. 

Treatment staff monitor and grade behavior throughout all activities,
including recreational activities.  Youths receive daily grades on
behaviors, and these form the basis for privileges such as
allowances, extended bedtimes, and outing participation. 

Youths in the program go to one of three private schools that the
program shares with other KidsPeace programs.  Families receive
counseling either from program staff--if the families live nearby--or
from clinical affiliates in their communities.  Youths participate
with their families in that counseling either while on home visits or
by monthly conference call. 

In developing a plan for discharge, a program social worker
coordinates with service resources in the community to which the
youth is returning.  After discharge, program staff provide in-home
counseling to sustain program gains. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:7.0.8

Routinely collected data.  None

Special studies.  The program is currently in the fourth year of an
evaluative research project looking at selected outcomes between 1
and 2 years after discharge.  The project was able to contact 30 of
the 78 youths who were discharged in 1990 after completing at least 6
months in the program.  Some did not answer all questions; however,
of those that responded, outcomes reported included

  23 of the 30 (77 percent) were living in a less restrictive
     setting;

  15 of 27 (56 percent) reported they had not had any police
     involvement, while 12 reported they had;

  8 of 25 (32 percent) were employed; and

  23 (77 percent) were satisfied with the care they had received. 


   OASIS CENTER, MICHAEL'S KIDS
   HOUSE
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8

The program provides counseling services and training in the living
skills that will enable youths to live independently and to persevere
in an educational setting or a job. 


         SETTING
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.1

The Michael's Kids House group home in Nashville, Tennessee, is in a
residential community close to city bus lines.  It contains three
bedrooms, two baths, a living room, dining room, kitchen, and office. 
As part of the program, some youths move on to apartments in which
they live more independently. 

In addition to Michael's Kids House, Oasis Center programs in
Nashville include a runaway shelter, crisis counseling, a teen crisis
line, and a youth employment program. 


         NUMBER OF YOUTHS SERVED
         IN 1992
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.2

The maximum capacity was 13 (6 in the group home and 7 in
apartments); the average population at a given time was 13.  The
total served was 32. 


         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.3

Michael's Kids House serves boys and girls aged 17 to 21 who do not
have any other safe living alternatives and who typically have had
numerous previous placements.  All youths are in the custody of the
Tennessee Department of Human Services.  They are referred by that
department or by the Tennessee Department of Youth Development
because of a lack of a suitable family environment or behavior
problems.  Youths exhibit various problems, such as school failure,
emotional difficulties, and drug abuse, and many are victims of
parental abuse, neglect, or abandonment.  About two-thirds are white
and about one-quarter are African-American. 

To be eligible for the program, youths must be willing to pursue an
education plan and maintain at least part-time employment.  They must
not be currently involved in destructive behavior such as drug and
alcohol use or stealing.  Finally, they must have a level of
intelligence that will permit them to function within the program. 


         LENGTH OF STAY
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.4

The average length of stay was 9 months in the group home, although
data were not available for the apartment stay.  Stays ranged from 9
months to 3 years for group home and apartment combined stay. 


         COST PER YOUTH
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.5

For 1 year of treatment, the cost was $24,321.  This figure includes
costs of both group home and apartment phases.  For an average stay
of 9 months, the program could not provide cost data.

         TREATMENT APPROACH
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.7

Michael's Kids House tries to provide a balance between freedom and
structure within the context of a group home.  While youths are
encouraged to learn to make decisions on their own, they are required
to sign an agreement to live within house rules.  With the help of a
primary counselor, youths develop a contract defining individual
goals and the training in skills that will be needed after discharge. 
Youths who violate their contracts or house rules receive counseling,
may be put on probation, and may be expelled from the program. 

Skills such as money management, comparative shopping, and eating
nutritiously are taught in course form, and staff ensure that youths
are given opportunities for supervised practice. 

The program also provides education assessment and counseling to help
youths set appropriate educational goals.  Additionally, it provides
employment services such as a week-long course to help youth identify
their strengths and weaknesses, instruction on how to get and keep
employment, and job placement.  All youth are required to participate
in individual counseling and a group counseling session once a week. 

While staff are responsible for enforcing rules against illegal or
destructive activity, their principal role is to guide youths in
making personal decisions and to provide support as youths experience
the consequences of those decisions.  Staff work in shifts, with a
counselor always on call. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:8.0.8

Routinely collected data.  Oasis gathers information on Michael's
Kids House Program youths after discharge--through phone calls and
from what youths report at an annual homecoming event.  Information
includes boys' and girls' living status and education.  They report
that five of the nine youths (56 percent) who had completed the
program in 1992 had achieved all aspects of what the program
considers successful completion, meaning they (1) had been discharged
to a placement outside the state human services system or to an
independent living situation; (2) had a home to go to; and (3) had
demonstrated the skills of employability, money management, and using
support systems.  All nine who completed the program were employed.

   PRESSLEY RIDGE SCHOOLS, GRANT
   GARDENS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:9

The program seeks to break the cycle of repeated out-of-home
placements for status offenders, that is, youth with delinquent
behavior such as chronic truancy or running away.  It is operated by
an organization that has the goal of being a national leader in
developing and providing services to children and families with
difficult problems.  Pressley Ridge School at Grant Gardens was
established to serve status offenders. 


         SETTING
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:9.0.1

The residential program of Pressley Ridge School at Grant Gardens is
in Ona, West Virginia--a small, rural community east of Huntington. 

Grant Gardens also provides community-based services such as family
preservation and therapeutic foster care.  It is 1 of 12 programs in
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, and Ohio operated by Pressley
Ridge Schools of Pittsburgh.  Pressley Ridge's services include
in-home and family preservation services, a day-school, shelter care,
foster care, and three residential facilities.

         CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUTHS
         SERVED
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:9.0.3

The residential program of Pressley Ridge School at Grant Gardens
serves boys and girls aged 13 to 17 from southern West Virginia.  All
of its youths, who are about equally divided between boys and girls,
are in state custody for such offenses as truancy or being out of
parental control, though some may have delinquency adjudications as
well.  About 90 percent of the youths have had previous placements. 

Eighty percent come from families with incomes below $15,000, and 95
percent come from single-parent families.  About half have a history
of physical abuse or neglect, and 30 percent have been sexually
abused.  Eighty percent of the boys and girls are referred by the
West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services; 15 percent are
referred by probation officers; and 5 percent are referred by mental
health sources.  About 50 percent of the youths served have exhibited
all four risky behaviors:  poor performance in school, substance
abuse, delinquency, and early, unprotected sexual activity. 


         LENGTH OF STAY

         TREATMENT APPROACH
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:9.0.7

For each youth, staff develop (1) an individual treatment plan that
addresses all identified issues, building on the youth's strengths,
and (2) a behavior management plan that teaches skills for
independent living.  Each boy's or girl's progress toward achieving
behavior goals is assessed at the end of each day, with the youth,
staff, and peer group awarding points, as positive reinforcers, based
on their combined assessment of the youth's behavior.  Members of the
peer group, which is central to the program, hold one another
accountable for inappropriate behavior.  As conflict arises or youth
display inappropriate behavior, staff work within the group process,
discussing the consequences of behaviors.  Staff use role modeling to
help youths learn appropriate behaviors in observed problem
situations and relate them to situations that might arise at home or
in the community.  For example, when a youth loses his or her temper,
staff may discuss and demonstrate behaviors that could later help the
youth cope effectively with a family member's losing his or her
temper.  Staff also work on identified problems with the youth. 

Youths attend school on campus for as long as necessary until they
can function in a community school setting.  Most youths attend
school on campus for about 25 percent of their stay at the
residential programs at Grant Gardens.  Thereafter, they attend
community schools. 

The program emphasizes family participation, recognizing that even
though the youth is in the custody of the state, he or she may return
to the family.  Staff ask families what the families need to help
their youngsters achieve a successful outcome and try to help them
meet those needs.  By scheduling meetings at the family's
convenience, the program is able to involve about 80 percent of
families. 

Ninety percent of participants receive follow-up services in the
first 6 months after discharge, paid for either by Medicaid or by the
Department of Social Services on a fee-for-service basis.  Based on
needs identified in formulating discharge plans, Grant Gardens has
also begun providing home services and child placement services for
those boys and girls who cannot return to their families. 


         EFFECTIVENESS DATA
---------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:9.0.8

Routinely collected data.  According to Pressley Ridge officials,
because Grant Gardens was established in 1990, they do not yet have
outcome data for that program.  However, they provided us with
outcome data from Laurel Park, a program established several years
earlier for status offenders in northern West Virginia.  According to
Pressley Ridge officials, the two programs are comparable and would
be expected to have similar outcomes. 

Outcome data have been collected 1 to 2 years after discharge for all
youths discharged from 1983 to 1990.  Data include such measures as
going to school or working, restrictiveness of living situation,
educational placement, drug use, stealing, and negative police
contacts.  Of 15 youths discharged from Laurel Park during the year
ending June 1990, for example, 10 (67 percent) were in school or
working 1 year later, 11 (73 percent) had earned a high school
diploma or GED certificate or were needing less support in school, 12
(80 percent) were in a less restrictive living situation, 3 (20
percent) were using drugs, and 3 (20 percent) had at least one police
contact. 

Special studies.  No special studies have been conducted at the
residential program at Grant Gardens, but one has been conducted at
Laurel Park.  Pressley Ridge Schools collected outcome data for 3
years on youths discharged between July 1987 and June 1988.  Pressley
Ridge staffs were able to locate 14 of 17 youths 1 to 2 years after
discharge and 12 of 17 youths 3 to 4 years after discharge from
Laurel Park to participate in this study.  Staff interviewed the
youths' probation officers, caseworkers, other Pressley Ridge staff,
teachers, youths' families, and the youths themselves.  Three to 4
years after discharge, some outcomes showed improvement compared to 1
to 2 years after discharge, and others did not.  For example, 3 to 4
years after discharge,

  all 12 (100 percent) were living in a less restrictive setting
     compared to 12 of 14 (86 percent) 1 to 2 years after discharge,

  6 of 12 (50 percent) were either going to school or working
     compared to 5 of 14 (36 percent) 1 to 2 years after discharge,

  2 of 12 (17 percent) were using drugs compared to 4 of 14 (29
     percent) 1 to 2 years after discharge,

  6 of 12 (50 percent) had been involved in a physically aggressive
     act compared to 5 of 14 (36 percent) 1 to 2 years after
     discharge, and

  4 of 12 (33 percent) had negative police contacts compared to 3 of
     14 (21 percent) 1 to 2 years after discharge. 

While other Pressley Ridge programs that provide therapeutic foster
care, day school, or treatment in a wilderness setting showed better
results than Laurel Park on several dimensions--such as school or
work status--a larger percentage of Laurel Park youths were living
with their own family, with a foster family, or independently on
their own.

Although poverty and the erosion of families and neighborhoods have put
many teenage girls at risk of pregnancy, school failure, and substance
abuse, programs aimed at helping them are often too little, too late.
However, GAO found that some communities are organizing coalitions with
private and public agencies to integrate services and reach more young
women at risk. This report (1) describes the health and the well-being
of young at-risk teen girls and their families and the condition of the
urban neighborhoods where they live; (2) presents local service

the service needs of this group.

May 10, 1995

The Honorable Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Ranking Minority Member
Committee on Finance
United States Senate

Dear Senator Moynihan: 

In recent years, concerns about rising caseloads and long-term
dependence on welfare programs, such as Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC), have focused attention on the nation's
welfare system.  In 1993, AFDC supported almost 5 million low-income
families across the United States and was projected to cost over $26
billion in federal and state funds in fiscal year 1995. 
Increasingly, concerns have centered on the rising number of teenage
mothers, and particularly on the high public costs associated with
their dependence on programs such as AFDC. 

The forces that place a young teen girl at serious risk of long-term
welfare receipt begin very early.  Recent reports have noted the
positive association between growing up in an adverse environment,
such as an abusive family or an impoverished neighborhood, and future
cognitive, behavioral, and physical functioning.\1 However, the
current mix of education, health, and social support programs has
been unable to mitigate the effects of multiple family problems and
deteriorating neighborhoods on the children being raised in these
environments, particularly young teen girls.  While many federal,
state, and local human service programs target at-risk children and
their families, the programs are not configured and services are not
delivered in ways that maximize their impact on multiple family
problems. 

Because of these concerns, you asked us for information about young
teen girls who may be at risk for AFDC dependency.\2 Specifically,
our focus was the following: 

  describe the health and well-being of young at-risk teen girls and
     their families, and the condition of the urban neighborhoods
     where they live;

  obtain the local service providers' perspectives on the needs of
     these girls, how they are addressing those needs, and what
     obstacles service providers face in working with the girls,
     their families, and their communities; and

  describe how the communities where these girls live are responding
     to the service needs of this group. 

To develop this information, we reviewed the relevant literature,
contacted experts on services for at-risk adolescents, analyzed data
collected by the Bureau of the Census, and conducted site visits in
three urban neighborhoods--Ward 7 in Washington, D.C.; Boyle Heights
in Los Angeles, California; and West Oakland in Oakland, California. 
In addition, we visited a community redevelopment project in Detroit,
Michigan.  (A complete discussion of our methodology and descriptions
of the neighborhoods appear in apps.  I and II.) We did our work in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

York:  Carnegie Corporation of New York, 1994); and Losing
Generations:  Adolescents in High Risk Settings, National Research
Council (Washington, D.C.:  National Academy Press, 1993). 

\2 For the purpose of this report, we defined young at-risk teen
girls as those who (1) have poor general life circumstances (such as
poverty) or exhibit problematic behavior (such as early sexual
activity) that is associated with problems such as teen pregnancy or
illegal </font><strong><font size="2" face="Courier New">drug</font></strong><font
size="2" face="Courier New"> use, and (2) generally fall into the age group of 10 to
15 years old. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

The forces of poverty--eroding the foundations of individuals,
families, and communities--can show some of their most debilitating
effects on young at-risk teen girls.  Service providers in the
neighborhoods we visited characterized many of the 10- to 15-year-old
girls they serve as detached and isolated from their families and
communities, sexually abused and neglected, and threatened by
violence.  A combination of poor economic and social conditions--(1)
poverty and deteriorating neighborhoods, (2) dysfunctional families,
and (3) poor self-image of the young teen girls themselves--has
created a population of adolescents with multiple problems who have
characteristics, such as early parenthood, associated with long-term
public dependency. 

Generally, community service providers told us that services for
at-risk girls aged 10 to 15 were limited, and the services that were
available were often provided after problems reached the crisis
stage.  The services that did exist in the neighborhoods we visited
were not coordinated, and they focused only on the teen and a
specific problem, ignoring, for example, the positive influence a
parent could have and, conversely, the negative impact of a
dysfunctional family.  We also found that these girls (1) received a
lower level of services than other at-risk groups, (2) were offered
few preventive services, and (3) had limited access to the array of
health and support services, provided in a safe environment, that
experts agree are needed by young at-risk teen girls.  Community
service providers told us that the services needed to address sexual
abuse and exploitation, psychological and physical neglect, and </font><strong><font size="2" face="Courier New">drug
</font></strong><font size="2" face="Courier New">and alcohol dependency were nonexistent, unknown or ignored by those
in need, or located far from neighborhoods. 

To better serve and reach more area residents, including young girls,
some neighborhoods are organizing coalitions, led by local providers,
often with assistance from private organizations and public agencies. 
In some cases, these efforts at integrating services have had a
positive effect on neighborhood children.  Some providers, often
working in middle schools, have expanded their role in the community
to better integrate services for at-risk teens and their families. 
Providers working in these coalitions told us they believed the
emergence of neighborhood leadership is critical to the long-term
success of the coalitions.  New service delivery strategies being
tried include identifying and providing multiple preventive services
and activities, contacting parents or guardians and encouraging them
to become involved in their children's activities, and increasing the
community's participation and commitment to the initiative. 


   BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

There is growing concern among program providers and policymakers
that large numbers of our nation's adolescents--particularly young
girls between the ages of 10 and 15--are at great risk for a number
of problems including pregnancy, alcohol and </font><strong><font size="2" face="Courier New">drug</font></strong><font
size="2" face="Courier New"> abuse, and school
failure.  Many of these young teens live in poor neighborhoods.\3
According to the 1992 Current Population Survey (CPS), there were
over 7 million girls under 18 years old living in poverty, with over
2.5 million residing in poor neighborhoods.  In addition, as many as
half of all adolescents aged 10 to 15 are reported to be at moderate
or high risk of school failure, early sexual activity, </font><strong><font size="2"
face="Courier New">drug</font></strong><font size="2"
face="Courier New"> and
alcohol use, or criminal behavior.\4 Among the most far reaching and
costly of all negative outcomes for young at-risk girls is early
parenthood.  In 1990, about 361,000 babies were born to unmarried
teenagers--approximately 9 percent of all births in that year.\5

      TEEN BIRTHS RISING AND
      COSTLY
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1

From 1960 to 1992, the birth rate for all teens increased from 15.3
to 44.6 births per thousand.  While the number of births to the very
young--aged 15 and younger--is not large, this group is experiencing
the greatest rate of increased births.\6 Pregnancy rates for all
girls under 15 years old rose 4.1 percent in the United States during
the period between 1980 and 1988--higher than any other teen age
group.  In addition, these young mothers often have other
characteristics that are associated with long-term welfare dependency
and other long-term problems, such as deficient education and
employment skills and histories of child abuse and neglect. 

The public costs of teen mothers are high.  According to the most
recent Census data available, nearly one-half of all women receiving
AFDC from 1976 to 1992 were or had been teenage mothers (see fig. 
1).  In addition, these women were more likely to be the least
educated and have larger families, thus making them the least likely
to leave AFDC and become self-sufficient.\7 The Center for Population
Options estimated that in 1992 the federal government spent over $34
billion on AFDC, Medicaid, and Food Stamps to support families begun
by teens.

      PAST PREVENTION PROGRAMS
      HAVE SHOWN LITTLE SUCCESS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.2

Generally, teen pregnancy prevention projects have produced less than
encouraging results, whether programs were targeted to prevent teens
from their first pregnancy or additional pregnancies.  For example,
the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) reviewed pregnancy
prevention programs that attempted to (1) increase teens' knowledge
about reproduction, (2) improve access to contraceptives, or (3)
broaden teens' life options.  OTA concluded that despite some
promising approaches, no evidence existed of significantly reduced
pregnancy rates among teen girls when the approaches were applied
independently. 

Intervening after teens have become sexually active or after they
have given birth appears to be too late for positive impacts,
regardless of the type of program.  For example, a national
demonstration project that provided education and employability
development as well as other supportive services to teen mothers was
unsuccessful at reducing the rate of second pregnancies among teen
mothers.  The developers of this effort recognized the difficulty of
overcoming &quot;serious obstacles to advancement, some psychological in
nature, others related to dysfunctional families, dangerous schools
and neighborhoods, and other factors in their social, physical, and
economic environments.&quot;\8

Historically, federal initiatives to address the individual problems
of youths, their families, and teen pregnancy have generally resulted
in &quot;single-problem&quot; programs and reactive, crisis-oriented service
strategies by local providers.  A Congressional Research Service
(CRS) study concluded that some federal programs aimed at reducing
the incidence of teen pregnancy disagree on the federal role,
resulting in a patchwork of differing goals ranging from promoting
abstinence to encouraging the use of pregnancy planning among
sexually active teens.\9 Consequently, federal programs often support
local projects that target one of these goals at the exclusion of
others.

   POOR, DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES
   AND DETERIORATING NEIGHBORHOODS
   IMPACT ON YOUNG AT-RISK TEEN
   GIRLS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

In neighborhoods with high concentrations of poor families, many 10-
to 15-year-old girls have multiple problems.  The combination of
abuse and neglect in young teens' households and dangerous and
decaying neighborhoods has increased the numbers of young teen girls
with the risk characteristics associated with long-term welfare
dependency, education deficits, and early parenthood.  These girls
are growing up under circumstances that often compromise their
health, impair their sense of self, limit their development
potential, and generally restrict their chances for independent and
productive lives. 


      FAMILY ABUSE AND NEGLECT
      LEAVE YOUNG TEEN GIRLS
      ISOLATED AND VULNERABLE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1

In the neighborhoods we visited, family poverty combined with
parental substance abuse and sexual or physical abuse of children
makes growing up a significant challenge for many young girls.  Many
of the girls in these communities lived in households where the
income was below the poverty level.\10 In Washington, D.C.'s, Ward 7,
for example, according to the 1990 census, 18 percent of the
households were considered to be poor.\11 In addition, many of the
girls in the communities we visited lived in single-parent
households, typically headed by their mothers.\12 These households,
as characterized by providers, lacked parental supervision and left
young girls isolated from family members as well as from their
neighborhoods.  The principal of a middle school in West Oakland told
us that many of her female students' parents were abusing drugs or
alcohol, and crime and violence proliferated in their neighborhoods;
one or both parents were often absent; and many of the adults in the
homes did not have the skills and abilities to function as parents. 

Families living in poverty are stressed and constrained by the normal
activities of daily life, which can make parents and children feel
hopeless and helpless.  In our interviews with service providers and
our reviews of recent studies, we found (1) high rates of substance
abuse among the parents of young teen girls, (2) widespread physical
and sexual abuse of teen girls, and (3) many young girls that were
left unattended for long periods of time and who often assumed adult
responsibilities in their homes. 

Factors associated with family dysfunction, such as substance abuse,
were prevalent in all the communities we visited.  Nationally, rates
of </font><strong><font size="2" face="Courier New">drug</font></strong><font
size="2" face="Courier New"> and alcohol abuse among women living in poverty and AFDC
recipients, for example, have been estimated to range from more than
15 percent to almost 30 percent.\13 </font><strong><font size="2" face="Courier New">Drug</font></strong><font
size="2" face="Courier New"> and alcohol abuse among
parents was seen as a widespread, serious problem by many
neighborhood providers, as well as by the young teen girls
themselves.  For example, in the West Oakland neighborhood we
visited, the arrest rate for narcotics was more than double that for
all of Oakland.  Boyle Heights in Los Angeles registered almost three
times the rate of alcohol-related arrests as Los Angeles as a whole
between 1991 and 1993.  The Ward 7 community was no different.  The
Director of Recreation for Washington, D.C., said that many of the
young girls the Department of Recreation serves witness daily alcohol
and </font><strong><font size="2" face="Courier New">drug</font></strong><font
size="2" face="Courier New"> abuse. 

Physical and sexual abuse were also reported by community providers
as significant problems.  In West Oakland, where the reported number
of sexual abuse incidents rose from 49 in 1992 to 91 in 1993, the
Adolescent Family Life Director believed that as many as 65 percent
of the young girls the office serves have been sexually abused.  Some
providers reported that young victims of abuse--characteristically
passive, lacking self-esteem, and pressured into early sex by
extended family members and older men--have few options or role
models and often follow what are seen as common practices in their
neighborhoods.  Providers in residential care facilities for
parenting teens reported that most of their clients were victims of
abuse.  Recent research confirms their observations.  Studies
reported that as many as 68 percent of teen mothers were sexually
abused as children.\14

According to community providers, young girls are often unsupervised
or on their own for extended periods of time and essentially
parenting themselves, which isolates them from their families and
communities and makes them vulnerable to outside influences.  Local
providers believed that many of these girls become the functioning
adult in the household and assume the responsibility of caring for
younger family members.

$11,521.

      NEIGHBORHOODS OFTEN
      DANGEROUS AND DECAYING
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.2

The condition of the neighborhoods where these girls live induces
fear and apprehension throughout the community.  Their high crime
rate, deteriorating infrastructure, and scarcity of commercial
ventures threatens neighborhood children and provides them with few
positive examples of future livelihoods.  The areas we visited also
had high numbers of declining public and private residential housing
units.  Each of these areas started out as a vibrant section of the
city, but a variety of socioeconomic factors over time has caused
these areas to deteriorate, leaving vacant and dilapidated buildings
and reduced community resources.  (Fig.  2 contains photographs of
the neighborhoods we visited.)

Crime is an important contributor to the destruction of a community. 
Young teen girls in the neighborhoods we visited feared for their
safety and saw few places of refuge.  In Boyle Heights, gang violence
is a serious problem.  Providers told us that the approximately 30
gangs in the area had a membership of about 15,000.  In 1993, the
police reported 763 gang-related crimes in the Boyle Heights area
alone.  Service providers told us that the teen girls in the area are
at risk of joining gangs--one provider estimated that about 60
percent of the teen girls are already in gang-related activities. 
Although gang-related crimes were not reported to be high in
Washington, D.C., the homicide rate in 1993 for Ward 7 was more than
double that for the whole city.  The girls we spoke with said that
they feared going outside and preferred to stay at home.  One girl
told us that she feels &quot;paranoid .  .  .  wondering which way the
bullet will go.&quot;

The physical and economic infrastructure of the neighborhoods we
visited paralleled the social conditions.  The neighborhoods were
characterized by high numbers of public housing units--Washington,
D.C.'s Ward 7 had the highest concentration of public housing units
in the city.  This neighborhood once had a solid middle-class
residential and small business presence.  Today, although the area
continues to be residential with over 70,000 residents, 25.8 percent
of the households were poor in 1990.  In addition, although the area
once had a substantial number of small businesses and stores, it now
has no restaurants, except for fast-food places, and few
opportunities for cultural activities.  Boyle Heights, once an
affluent suburb, is a mixture of aging commercial and industrial
sections and subsidized housing.  West Oakland has no </font><strong><font size="2" face="Courier New">drug</font></strong><font
size="2" face="Courier New"> stores,
banks, or major grocery stores to serve its more than 15,000
residents.

      YOUNG GIRLS IN THESE
      NEIGHBORHOODS ARE AT RISK
      FOR MULTIPLE PROBLEMS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.3

The interplay of family poverty--often with parental substance abuse
and child neglect and abuse--and neighborhoods with few resources
leaves young teen girls at risk for many problems and dangerous
behaviors.  Research studies and reviews have noted the relationship
between adverse living conditions and outcomes that seriously impede
teens' growth to self-sufficiency. 

Family poverty and parental dysfunction are associated with a number
of problems among the children in the household.  First, the
relationship between teen births and poverty is clear.  Nearly half
of the AFDC caseload is made up of women who gave birth during their
teens, and these women are also less likely to have completed their
high school education.  Their children are in poorer overall health
and can, as a result, suffer developmentally--increasing the
likelihood of poor school performance.  Parental </font><strong><font size="2" face="Courier New">drug</font></strong><font
size="2" face="Courier New"> and alcohol
abuse has been shown to significantly increase the odds that an
adolescent will become a substance abuser.  Likewise, research has
demonstrated a relationship between a woman's being abused as a child
and her becoming a teen mother. 

Neighborhoods with high concentrations of poor families generally
have poor quality schools that, in addition to family economic
stresses, increase the chance that children will fail in school or
drop out.  Children in poor neighborhoods also run a high risk of
becoming both victims and perpetrators of crimes.  Compounding the
problem, because high numbers of youths and adults in these
communities exhibit negative and antisocial behavior, positive
community role models are scarce or absent.  These distressed
communities, with large numbers of children at risk, challenge the
limited number of service providers and the poorly coordinated
overall system of care. 


   COMPLEX NEEDS RARELY REFLECTED
   IN SERVICES FOR YOUNG TEEN
   GIRLS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :4

Communities with high numbers of young at-risk teen girls have had
limited success in designing services and approaches that would help
the most vulnerable of these young teens.  The few services for these
girls and their families are typically offered only when problems
reach the crisis state.  Neighborhood residents see providers and
services open and close as funding appears and disappears.  Providers
believed that the services available generally ignore the positive
role a parent can play in a child's development, as well as the
negative impact of a dysfunctional family.  Services designed to help
dysfunctional families, such as mental health and substance abuse
treatment, are either in short supply or far from the neighborhoods. 
Many experts agree that young at-risk teen girls could be better
served if traditional approaches were modified to include early
identification and treatment, long-term program commitment, and
greater community involvement. 


      NEIGHBORHOOD SERVICES NOT
      DESIGNED TO MEET MULTIPLE
      PROBLEMS OF AT-RISK TEENS
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.1

Many of the providers in the neighborhoods we visited said that
supportive services were often provided too late and lacked
continuity.  Most of the human services available to at-risk teens
were crisis-oriented--provided only after a problem had occurred. 
For example, the schools in all communities we visited had
specialized programs for teens who were either pregnant or already
parents of very young children.  Oakland's school-based Adolescent
Family Life Program provided health and supportive services, parent
education, job training, and counseling to teen girls under 17 years. 
However, to be eligible, a girl must be either pregnant or a parent. 
Providers saw the need for a more continuous approach to avoid early
parenthood, such as offering early instruction and counseling or
beginning career orientation programs in primary school.  Early
instruction and counseling is needed, they believed, because of the
shortage of positive adult role models and the fact that these girls
live in neighborhoods that often condone dependency and
submissiveness.  In West Oakland, a middle school counselor told us
that any positive effects on young girls that a program supplying
mental health workers to an elementary school had were eroded when
the program was not continued in high school. 

In addition, service providers cited a number of critical services
needed by young teen girls that were either scarce or nonexistent. 
These include preventive services, such as strategies to avoid early
sexual activity and pregnancy, resist </font><strong><font size="2" face="Courier New">drug</font></strong><font
size="2" face="Courier New"> use, and avoid gang
membership; after-school recreational activities in a safe
environment; and ways to identify early signs of school failure.  A
counselor at the Boyle Heights Boys and Girls Club saw young girls as
the &quot;forgotten majority.&quot; As their performance in school falters or
they leave school because they are pregnant, they are barely missed
by the community institutions, unlike the highly visible and
sometimes violent young boy.  Through our visits to neighborhoods and
local inventories of existing services in those neighborhoods, we
found few service providers who offered preventive care to young teen
girls.  For example, in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, we found only
one prevention program targeting young girls--Education Now and
Babies Later.  Safe and secure locations where young girls could find
recreational activities before and after school and on weekends were
very rare in these communities.  Violent gang activity, especially in
the Boyle Heights neighborhood, where there are reportedly 30
separate gangs, creates an environment of fear.  Several of the young
teens we interviewed said that they felt unsafe walking in their own
neighborhood and often were afraid to come out of their home. 


      FEW SERVICES OFFERED TO
      DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.2

In the neighborhoods we visited, the number and scope of mental
health services, including substance abuse treatment, supportive
services designed to identify potentially abusive parents, and
efforts to prevent abuse from occurring, fell far short of addressing
the communities' problems.  According to providers, community-based
treatment and prevention programs geared to dysfunctional families,
especially those emphasizing mental health and substance abuse
issues, were either not available, in short supply, or located far
from the neighborhoods. 

Community service providers believe that family dysfunction adversely
affects the growth and development of young teen girls and can lead
to long-term dependency on public assistance.  While providers
reported the need for and lack of mental health services for the
young girls in their communities, they also said that the parents
are, at best, not prepared for their role as a parent and, at worst,
need clinical treatment themselves. 

Even when the programs exist, providers said that difficulty in
getting parents involved in their children's activities is a
significant barrier to serving at-risk teen girls.  According to
providers, parents are often unaware of their children's activities;
may condone early sexual activity and childbearing; and give little
attention and support to their children.  Providers told us that
often these characteristics are a function of long-standing and
established patterns of parenting in the neighborhood and a general
sense of hopelessness in the community.  For example, counselors from
a West Oakland middle school estimated that &quot;75 percent of the
mothers are not there for their children.&quot; In this school, children
were reluctant to have a day to honor their mothers, and preferred to
have their teachers attend.  In about half the cases, according to a
middle school principal, by the time a young girl reaches middle
school, her household has dissolved and she is living with a
grandparent.\15


--------------------
\15 In 1993, 5 percent of all children were living in a household
with grandparents present (3.7 percent of white children, 12.1
percent of black children, and 5.9 percent of Hispanic children).  Of
the households, 30 percent have only grandparents present--24.9
percent of white households, 38.7 percent of black households, and
22.8 percent of Hispanic households..  See Marital Status and Living
Arrangements. 


      ADOLESCENT SERVICES CAN
      IMPROVE WITH CHANGES IN
      APPROACH AND SCOPE
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :4.3

Research on the problems of adolescents and their service needs has
reached a number of conclusions about the best approaches to meeting
this population's multiple needs.  For example, OTA's study on
adolescent health--a comprehensive synthesis of the research
findings--notes growing consensus on key components to successful
preventive services for teens.\16 Recognizing along with other
researchers that many adolescents' needs for health and related
services are not being met with mainstream primary care, OTA
concluded that school or community-based centers can offer
comprehensive and accessible services.  Others have joined in
reexamining both programmatic and larger system strategies for
addressing the problems of at-risk teens generally and teen pregnancy
prevention specifically.  They concluded that certain programmatic
changes, moving toward a more comprehensive approach to care, can
lead to greater success.\17 For example, the Urban Institute's review
of program practices designed for at-risk adolescents cited the
following components for a successful program: 

  early identification and intervention;

  long-term and consistent intervention;

  individualized attention, instruction, and counseling;

  emphasis on skills enhancement, life options, and vocational
     orientation;

  development of multiple channels of influence, including parents,
     churches, and community organizations; and

  service delivery in a safe physical environment.\18

Techniques suggested by experts to better integrate community
services include collocating multiple service providers, joint
planning among providers, and new local-level funding strategies.\19

&quot;System&quot; changes involve trying new service delivery approaches and
attempting to reduce conflicts among programs by removing
inconsistencies in program rules and requirements.  In our previous
work, we found that to accomplish these changes, public and private
service agencies need to reorganize administrative structures around
common populations or problems, use more flexible funding approaches,
and create coordinated service planning at different levels of
government.\20

   NEW SERVICE APPROACHES DEPEND
   ON INCREASED COMMUNITY
   LEADERSHIP AND INVOLVEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :5

A community's ability to address the problems of at-risk teen girls
depends on more than a collection of programs and service providers. 
Residents and providers in the neighborhoods we visited are becoming
increasingly aware that a coordinated, integrated, and comprehensive
network of services is needed to address the problems of teen girls. 
To do this, neighborhoods may have to overcome deficiencies in their
own leadership and organization. 

Community service providers in the neighborhoods we visited viewed
the emergence of local leadership as an important ingredient in the
development of new service strategies.  They told us that identifying
local leaders to initiate community action, sustain community
support, and help residents gain control over their problems is key
to the organization of better services for young teen girls as well
as adolescents in general.  In Ward 7, West Oakland, and Detroit, for
example, coalitions and networks of local service providers are being
developed to improve the capacity to address community needs and
problems.  Neighborhood coalitions can take various forms.  The
neighborhoods we visited showed that these service coalitions can be
informal--a network consisting of frequent working relationships
among various providers; or they can be a formal, comprehensive
planning and implementation effort that incorporates residents,
merchants, service providers, and the area's public agencies. 
Throughout these cooperative efforts, similar themes shape their
goals and objectives.  Providers believed they have to work
collaboratively with local residents and businesses to deal with the
needs and problems of not only teen girls but also the families and
the communities as a whole.  Most importantly, these communities
realized that the strategies and solutions to their problems must
come from within. 

Local providers also found that they have to coordinate community
activities with one another as well as with other entities in the
community.  For example, providers in Detroit's North High School
neighborhood saw that they needed to link various activities in order
to address the needs and problems facing adolescents, their families,
and the surrounding neighborhood.  Through a major private
philanthropic organization in Michigan, the Kellogg Foundation, a
comprehensive 20-year planning and coordination effort was developed
jointly by the foundation and local providers and residents.  Other
efforts are more informal.  For example, the Teen Life Choices
program in Washington, D.C., established monthly lunch meetings that
included many of the youth service providers in the community.\21
These meetings served as a way to get neighborhood providers to
better understand each other's services, activities, and program
procedures. 

Local providers are also leading efforts to build coalitions with
area schools as a strategy to deliver coordinated programs to the
right age groups.  In all the neighborhoods we visited, junior high
or middle schools have emerged as major &quot;catchments&quot; for programs
serving at-risk teen girls.  For example, West Oakland's Lowell
Middle School and Washington, D.C.'s Evans Junior High School are
working with nonprofit agencies to deliver case management-style
programs in the schools to serve their teen populations.  Oakland's
Lowell Middle School provided on-site case management and support
services for students and their families.  These services included
individual and family counseling, home visits, crisis intervention,
and community service referrals.  Also, a West Oakland middle school
principal is planning a program to include students, parents, and the
community at large.  The program would operate between 4:00 p.m.  and
10:00 p.m.  and would provide a fitness lab, computer/job skills
training, medical information, mental health services, and parenting
courses.  Evans Junior High School's Turning Points program provided
individual counseling and group activities to students as well as
attempted to include parents by developing adult activities and
hiring parents as Turning Points staff.  \22

The collaborative school-based efforts we observed in Detroit and
West Oakland were achieving positive outcomes.  A preliminary
evaluation by the University of California of school-based projects
in West Oakland identified successes in the start-up of the
school-based programs.  These programs were seeing positive responses
from teachers and school officials as well as increased involvement
from teens and their families.  West Oakland found that these efforts
reduced the number of discipline hearing procedures and the number of
suspensions for students in schools receiving the services, when
these students were compared with students in schools not receiving
the services.  In Detroit, the community, along with the Kellogg
Foundation and Henry Ford Hospital, created a teen health clinic
within Hutchins Middle School.  The project reported a reduction in
teen pregnancies from 14 in 1991 to 1 in 1993, immunization for all
children in the school, and improved standardized achievement test
scores over 2 years in both reading and math. 

Both the literature and neighborhood providers told us that key to
the development of any school-based program is the acceptance and
approval of the school's principal.\23

Principals hold significant leverage over school curriculum and
physical space.  In addition, school principals are well informed
about what is going on in school neighborhoods because they
participate in various neighborhood activities and coordinating
councils.  Neighborhood providers and school officials we interviewed
agreed that a program's success depends on the principal's acceptance
of it.  In some cases, programs have to overcome the reluctance of
principals and teachers, who may try to &quot;wait out&quot; new initiatives. 
Providers told us that principals and school staff view new programs
as politically motivated, claiming overly optimistic results, or
requiring school time and physical space that could crowd out other
programs and curricula. 


--------------------
\21 Teen Life Choices ceased operation on Octorber 1, 1994, as a
result of city budget cuts. 

\22 In February 1995, the Turning Points Program at Evans Junior High
School and 14 other middle and elementary schools in Washington,
D.C., was eliminated as a result of the city's budget cuts.

   CONCLUSIONS
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :6

The conditions that surround many young at-risk teen girls, which
have replaced the traditional supports provided by functioning
families and safe neighborhoods, have created a group of children
with few options for future success.  These children are among the
most vulnerable and least visible residents of our urban areas, and
are extremely difficult to serve.  Often last in line for services
delivered from a taxed and fragmented delivery system, at-risk teen
girls--if left unserved--will continue to use scarce public resources
and remain waiting to join the rolls of long-term welfare recipients. 
Individual programs alone, while well-intended and innovative in
their approaches, have had little effect on the overwhelming, complex
problems of this population.  Community-designed and -directed
initiatives that coordinate human service programs have shown promise
in some urban neighborhoods in attacking the broader influences that
place the well-being of these children and their families at risk. 
These initiatives need to facilitate collaborative planning,
problem-solving, and program development at the neighborhood level. 
The challenge for both policymakers and program officials is to
develop and implement national strategies that will support local
leadership and at the same time foster cooperative ventures among
local service providers.

Because this report focuses on local responses to at-risk teens and
their families, we did not obtain agency comments.  We did discuss,
as a part of our field work, our observations with local providers
and program officials. 

We are sending copies of this report to relevant congressional
committees and other interested parties.  Copies will also be made

SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
=========================================================== Appendix I

To develop the information for this report, we collected and reviewed
the literature on adolescent health and service approaches to at-risk
teens.  In addition, we reviewed studies on teen pregnancy and
prevention and analyzed data collected by the Bureau of the Census. 
We also contacted program officials from federal agencies and
representatives from organizations who were familiar with this
population and its service needs. 

We visited three urban neighborhoods for close review--Ward 7 in
Washington, D.C.; Boyle Heights in Los Angeles, California; and West
Oakland in Oakland, California--to document the availability of human
services for at-risk teen girls; the barriers to serving this
population; and how communities are responding to this population's
service needs.  We selected these neighborhoods because they had (1)
high numbers of at-risk teens who had characteristics such as high
rates of poverty, teen births, and crime; and had (2) some services
for young adolescents.  In addition, we visited a community
development program in Detroit, Michigan, that was supported by a
private foundation.  We interviewed local officials, service
providers, and young teen girls served by service providers to
identify the programs and problems in these neighborhoods.  We did
our work between September 1993 and December 1994 in accordance with
generally accepted government auditing standards. 


PROFILES OF THE THREE
NEIGHBORHOODS REVIEWED
========================================================== Appendix II


   BOYLE HEIGHTS, LOS ANGELES,
   CALIFORNIA
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:1

Boyle Heights, located east of downtown Los Angeles, is one of the
oldest communities in the city.  Since the 1940s, Boyle Heights has
been populated by first-, second-, and third-generation families of
predominantly Mexican heritage.  The community has become an
important point of entry for thousands of new immigrants since the
1970s.  Boyle Heights has a population of over 94,000, and 94 percent
are of Hispanic origin. 

The majority of the area's housing was built in the 1920s.  Single
family houses compose 43 percent of the residential area.  Six of the
21 public housing projects in Los Angeles are located in Boyle
Heights, which include 2,166 units for about 8,300 residents. 
Commercial and industrial corridors in the area were developed in the
1920s and 1930s and currently include clothing and fabricated metal
production.  The predominant retail trade businesses are restaurants,
groceries, and clothing stores. 

Almost 70 percent of the households are low income, and the area has
a poverty rate of about 30 percent, compared with a citywide rate of
19 percent.  In 1990, the unemployment rate was almost 14 percent, 8
percent citywide.  Approximately 3,000 of the area's 14,500
school-age children are in AFDC households, and the area has the 11th
highest number of children receiving free and reduced-price meals in
Los Angeles County. 

The crime rate in Boyle Heights is higher than in the city as a
whole, with homicide at almost twice that of all of Los Angeles;
1991-93 averages were 13 homicides per 10,000 versus 7 per 10,000 for
the whole city.  Gang violence is a serious problem.  Local providers
estimate that about 30 gangs operate in the Boyle Heights
neighborhood.  According to Los Angeles Police Department data, 763
gang-related crimes were committed in the district covering Boyle
Heights in 1993.

   WEST OAKLAND, OAKLAND,
   CALIFORNIA
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:2

Over the past 40 years, West Oakland has declined from a vibrant
working-class community to a decaying neighborhood.  Neighborhood
conditions began to deteriorate after World War II, when houses built
for wartime workers were torn down as defense-related jobs dwindled. 
Also, large public construction projects, such as the Cypress
Freeway, a Bay Area Rapid Transit station, and a main postal
facility, displaced families, destroyed homes, and separated
commercial activity from the neighborhood.  Since the 1970s, the
neighborhood has been unable to regain the local businesses it once
had--the neighborhood has no </font><strong><font size="2" face="Courier New">drug</font></strong><font
size="2" face="Courier New"> stores, banks, or major grocery
stores. 

West Oakland has 12 public housing projects and one of the city's
highest concentrations of Section 8 housing assistance recipients. 
In addition, 39 percent of all housing units in West Oakland are
assisted housing, in contrast to 10 percent for the entire city of
Oakland. 

West Oakland has poverty and unemployment rates that far exceed those
of Oakland as a whole.  About 34 percent of West Oakland residents
live in poverty, almost double the city average of 19 percent. 
Moreover, more than half (55 percent) of the youths living in West
Oakland are poor, compared with 30 percent citywide. 

West Oakland is a dangerous neighborhood.  West Oakland's crime rates
exceed those in the rest of the city, with a homicide rate that is
more than double the citywide average, and rape and burglary rates
that are almost 150 percent higher.

   WARD 7, WASHINGTON, D.C. 
-------------------------------------------------------- Appendix II:3

Ward 7 is the easternmost ward in Washington, D.C., and it is
physically separated from the central and western sections of the
city by the Anacostia River.  Although it was never among the
wealthiest of the District's communities, Ward 7 once had a solid
base of middle-class families, as well as a substantial number of
small businesses and retail establishments.  However, the
out-migration of many middle-income families and businesses, which
began in the 1970s, has helped to destabilize the ward. 

Ward 7 has the highest concentration of public housing stock in the
city, one-third of the city's total stock--or about 2,880 units.  In
1990, Ward 7 had a population of about 73,000, as compared with over
86,000 in 1980.  The neighborhood in Ward 7 we visited had about
43,000 residents.  Over 25 percent of the Ward's residents live in
poverty.  In contrast, about 17 percent of the total Washington,
D.C., population lives in poverty.  Forty-six percent of the
neighborhood's 32,473 adult residents (16 and older) were either not
in the labor force or not employed. 

Nearly 5,300 families, or 67 percent of the Ward's families with
children, were headed by a single parent.  Further, 26 percent of its
population was under 18 years of age in 1990.  About 20 percent of
all births in the neighborhood were to females under age 20. 

In 1993, the Ward 7 neighborhood accounted for 64, or about 14
percent, of the city's 453 homicides and 11 percent of the reported
rapes that occurred in the city.

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986</b> </p>

<hr>

<h2>Overview of America's Habit </h2>

<p>This is the final report from President's Commission on
Organized Crime. It contains material on the nature, scope and
extent of organized crime, particularly as it relates to drug
trafficking, money laundering, and labor racketeering. </p>

<p>The President's Commission on Organized Crime </p>

<p>The President's Commission on Organized Crime was established
by Executive Order 12435 July 28, 1983. The Executive Order
directs the Commission to: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Make a full and complete national and region-by-region
        analysis of organized crime; </li>
    <li>Define the nature of traditional organized crime as well
        as emerging organized crime groups, the sources and
        amounts of organized crime's income, and the uses to
        which organized crime puts its income; </li>
    <li>Develop in-depth information on the participants in
        organized crime networks; </li>
    <li>Evaluate Federal laws pertinent to the effort to combat
        organized crime; </li>
    <li>Advise the President and the Attorney General with
        respect to its findings and actions which can be
        undertaken to improve law enforcement efforts directed
        against organized crime; </li>
    <li>Make recommendations concerning appropriate
        administrative and legislative improvements and
        improvements in the administration of justice; </li>
</ul>

<p>and </p>

<ul>
    <li>Report to the President from time to time as requested,
        and to submit its final report by March 1, 1986. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Commission is authorized to issue subpoenas for the
testimony of witnesses and the production of information, to
issue orders compelling testimony over a claim of the privilege
against self-incrimination, and to seek the assistance of the
Department of Justice in applying for writs of habeas corpus ad
testificandum or judicial orders requiring testimony or the
production of information before the Commission. In addition, the
Commission may obtain, use, and disclose electronic surveillance
data obtained by law enforcement agencies under Title III of the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, and other
information from Federal departments and agencies under the Bank
Secrecy Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, as well as from
financial institutions under the Right to Financial Privacy Act. </p>

<p>In the discharge of its responsibilities, the Commission has
prepared this report on organized crime's role in drug
trafficking and drug abuse. Based on the totality of the evidence
before it, the Commission has concluded that drug trafficking and
abuse together constitute the single most serious organized crime
issue confronting this Nation. </p>

<p>Therefore, in contrast to the other subjects covered in the
remainder of it's final report, this topic is treated in a
separate volume. The research and drafting on this report was
performed on the Commission's behalf by Chief Investigator Manuel
Gonzalez (FBI). Research assistants Abigail Johnson and Mary
Karol, Deputy Counsel Kevin McEnery, Investigator Thomas Sheehan
(DEA), and Contract Consultant Susan Mellody, under the
supervision of Deputy Executive Director Rodney G. Smith. </p>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter I The Impact of the Drug Trade </h2>

<p>Drug trafficking is the most serious organized crime problem
in the world today. The drug trade generates billions of dollars
for organized crime each year, imposing incalculable costs on
individuals, families, communities, and governments worldwide.
But drug trafficking is only part of a broader, unified
phenomenon, which also includes the illicit use of drugs. It is
drug users who finance organized crime through their drug
purchases, and it is they who must accept responsibility for the
broad range of costs associated with the drug industry. </p>

<p>Drug abuse ruins individual lives, drains billions of dollars
each year from American society, and erodes the nation's quality
of life. The violence and corruption that are an integral part of
organized crime drug trafficking take the lives of American and
foreign officials and private citizens, undermine drug control
efforts, and threaten entire governments. To the extent that the
stability of friendly nations is threatened, particularly in this
hemisphere, our own national security is jeopardized. The impact
of organized crime and drug trafficking on society thus has
far-ranging consequences, from the mental or physical destruction
of the individual drug user to questions of national security. </p>

<p>This Commission has found drug trafficking to be the most
widespread and lucrative organized crime activity in the United
States. According to this Commission's survey of local law
enforcement agencies, marijuana, cocaine, and dangerous drug
trafficking are the three primary activities of organized crime
groups, as defined by local agencies, nationwide. Drug
trafficking accounts for almost 38 percent of all organized crime
activity across the country and generates an income estimated to
be as high as $110 billion. </p>

<p>A concept fundamental to this report is the dual nature of the
drug phenomenon: drug supply and drug demand are mutually
dependent aspects of a single global problem. All strategic and
tactical evaluations in this report have been arrived at in this
context, and it is imperative that the planning undertaken by
this government and its allies be performed within the same
framework. The gaps that now exist between strategists who seek
to reduce supply and planners who want to reduce demand must be
closed. The situation confronting us is a crisis both nationally
and internationally. Our response can be no less than national
and international mobilization. As this report sets out in
detail, the menace of drugs is not restricted to a particular
segment of society, but is now of a scope and severity that is a
threat to our national security and therefore a legitimate
national security issue. </p>

<p>The appropriate response must therefore involve our entire
society, not just our law enforcement and health professionals.
Parents, educators, employers, the legal profession, financial
institutions, the military, and the diplomatic and intelligence
communities must all recognize that we are in a national
emergency. </p>

<p>Military strategists have warned and painful national
experience confirmed that a war must not be fought without a
clear notion of the victory sought. In this war on drugs - a
phrase worn by use but nevertheless the only accurate description
of what must be done - this Commission has adopted a definition
of victory: the dramatic reduction, if not complete elimination,
of drug abuse in this society. The ultimate goal is a distant
one, to be sure, requiring patience, determination and vision. No
less an objective is acceptable. Short fixes, compromises, and
resignation are a breach of faith with ourselves, our children,
and generations to come. </p>

<p>Just as we must clearly define victory, so must we identify
the enemy. Here again, there is no room for compromise. We must
unite against drugs themselves, and anyone who is their ally.
Producers, refiners, smugglers, and sellers, all those we know as
&quot;traffickers,&quot; are obvious targets. It is our
obligation to look further and recognize that those among us -
friends, relatives, colleagues, and other &quot;respectable&quot;
people - whose small, personal drug purchases at the base of the
consumption pyramid are the driving force behind the traffickers'
assault on this country. It is the consumer's dollars that come
together to finance the organized crime drug trafficking
described in this report, and it is thus their responsibility and
ours to confront this truth. This means an end to tolerance of
drug use at every level of society. </p>

<p>While all drug trafficking, by its nature, requires some
degree of organization, it is essential for the purposes of this
report to identify the threshold at which the organization
inherent in drug trafficking can be distinguished from organized
crime drug trafficking. The Commission's definition of organized
crime, which sets out the six characteristics of organized crime
groups, is helpful in making this distinction. These
characteristics are: continuity, structure, defined membership,
criminality, violence, and power as its goal. These elements,
together with a reliance on the &quot;buffer&quot; that this
Commission has found to be an integral part of organized crime,
are common to the world's most notorious trafficking
organizations. </p>

<p>This report examines the organized crime groups that traffic
in illicit drugs. To the extent necessary to grasp the dynamics
of worldwide drug traffic, it also details the nature of the
drugs themselves. It describes the array of enforcement agencies
currently in place, analyzes their various strategies and
tactics, and presents specific recommendations for more effective
anti-drug efforts. </p>

<p>In the portion of this report devoted to efforts to reduce the
supply of illicit drugs, &quot;Supply Strategies,&quot; it is
clear that our law enforcement and other government agencies,
particularly on the Federal level, are deployed with a degree of
determination, imagination, and resource commitment unparalleled
in American history. This government must continue to pursue
strategies to reduce supply with all possible vigor, or it is the
government's obligation to do all within its power to protect its
citizens, no matter how formidable the foe. Nevertheless, if the
demand for illicit drugs continues at its present voracious
level, improvements in the area of reducing supply will continue
to be slow, expensive, infrequent, and too often only temporary. </p>

<p>This report places great emphasis on the need for complete
national resolve in this area and for that resolve to be
translated into fully coordinated governmental action.
Compartmentalization and parochialism, which have been far too
common in past efforts, must be brought to an end. In this
regard, we are at a particularly propitious moment in history.
The slow and painful evolution of our strategy has finally
achieved a centralized authority for our national effort: the
National Drug Enforcement Policy Board. Not just another advisory
body, this Board is a true congregation of every component of our
national government's anti-drug effort. It provides the means for
achieving a thoroughly coordinated national attack on every
aspect of drug trafficking and abuse. It is vital that the Policy
Board move effectively, thoughtfully and decisively, but it is
most urgent that it move. Indecisiveness are signals in
themselves, the wrong signals, to drug traffickers, users,
concerned parents, health and social planners, and even foreign
governments. Perhaps most critically, indecisiveness and delay
are the wrong signals to those U.S. governmental agencies that
must choose where anti-drug efforts will fall on the list of
competing priorities in a time of hardening fiscal austerity. By
action, not mere promises, the Policy Board must send the proper
message: we are in a fight for our lives, and every agency must
arrange its priorities accordingly. </p>

<p>Our strategies to reduce supply will require not only
dedication, but patience and objectivity. The war against drugs
will not be won until individuals stop using them. Strategies to
reduce supply can do no more than hold the line against illegal
drugs while public attitudes and private choices change. That is
not to say that our enforcement strategies should not be
aggressive and persistent. On the contrary, this report makes
clear that there is much in this area that is being done and
should continue, and much more that might be done. Many of the
specific recommendations in this report are devoted to this
theme. What is necessary at the outset, however, is an
understanding that such efforts must not be judged by an
unrealistic standard. As long as this society is willing to
provide its enforcement agencies scarcely more than a penny for
every dollar our citizens squander on illicit drugs, it has no
right and no reason to expect more. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the curse of drug abuse will be broken, but only
by a nationwide dedication to persistent and unyielding assaults
on both supply and demand. The supply is already under siege by
our enforcement, diplomatic, and intelligence communities.
Because an end to consumption is our ultimate goal, it is a
concerted and direct attack on demand that must be mounted. </p>

<p>Illicit drugs are an attack upon the integrity, character, and
health of the individual. Although discussions of drugs are often
framed in terms of costs to society and society's responses, the
fact is that individuals, not societies, take drugs. It is the
individual user who finances all of the violence, corruption, and
degradation that this report describes. The powerful,
sophisticated, and thoroughly evil organized crime drug
trafficking groups described herein are a reflection of nothing
more than our self-destructiveness. It is as a result of
individual acts of will that such groups came to be and are
sustained, and it is by individual acts of will that they will
finally be defeated. <br>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter II Portrait of Drug Production and Use </h2>

<p>Cocaine Scope of the Problem </p>

<p>Once considered a fashionable drug for the wealthy, cocaine
and its deleterious effects are now beginning to be better
understood. In the past scientists made a clear distinction
between physical and psychological drug dependence, but the
health and social consequences of cocaine use have demonstrated
that the two courses lead to the same end: cocaine, like other
addictive drugs, ruins lives and kills. Widely available across
the United States, cocaine is now used by individuals of all
socioeconomic groups. The cocaine industry generates an estimated
$11 billion in illicit income annually, and it is growing.
Cocaine production, importation to the United States and
consumption have all increased significantly in recent years. The
cocaine industry is fueled by the approximately 25 million
Americans who have tried cocaine, of which five to six million
use it at least once per month. Of the regular users, it is
estimated that almost half may be considered addicted. Although
the total number of users appears to have leveled off in the last
few years, cocaine consumption has increased 12 percent between
1983 and 1984, from 50-68 metric tons to 55-76 metric tons. As
cocaine consumption has increased, so too have more dangerous
forms of use of the drug and the deleterious effects associated
with it. Cocaine-related deaths increased 77 percent from 1983 to
1984 and cocaine-related emergency room visits increased 51
percent. Requests for treatment for cocaine use have increased
600 percent during the past three years. In 18 states, cocaine is
reported as the primary drug of abuse for clients in treatment
facilities. There is no indication that without a comprehensive
effort at reduction of both the supply of and demand for cocaine,
the increases in cocaine use or its deleterious medical and
social effects will subside in the near future. From a law
enforcement perspective, the consequences of this tolerance and
addiction are the intense, steady and increasing demand for the
product, which generates vast revenues for organized crime.
Today's Cocaine User </p>

<p>The cocaine industry is sustained by the appetite of the
cocaine user. With the possible exception of marijuana, cocaine
is used by a wider demographic cross-section of society than any
other controlled substance. Facts demonstrate that the popular
belief that cocaine use is restricted to the wealthy is a myth.
For example, a study of 6,406 males arrested for serious crimes
and processed in New York City's Manhattan Central Booking police
office in 1984 reveals that 42 percent tested positively for
cocaine in their system, the drug most frequently detected. The
use of cocaine in combination with other drugs appears to be
increasing. Fifty-nine percent of the cocaine-related deaths in
1984 involved other drugs, particularly alcohol, heroin and PCP.
In addition, more dangerous routes of cocaine administration are
now being used. Use of &quot;speedballs,&quot; injections of
heroin and cocaine, which are often lethal, increased 37 percent
from 1983 to 1984. Smoking of coca paste and base, forms of
consumption with particularly dangerous health consequences, have
also increased. Surveys of cocaine users demonstrated there is no
&quot;typical&quot; cocaine user. Results of a 1983 survey of
callers to the national 800-COCAINE hotline indicate that the
average caller was a 31-year old, white, middle class male with
at least some college education and a job with an annual salary
exceeding $25,000. Results of the 1985 survey of callers to the
hotline reveal that more women, minorities and adolescents called
than just two years earlier, and 73 percent of callers in 1985
reported an income of less than $25,000 per year. While almost
half of the calls to the hotline in 1983 came from the northeast,
calls were fairly evenly geographically distributed in 1985. Just
as it has spread geographically and to different socioeconomic
groups, cocaine use has increased among certain age groups. Most
alarmingly, an increase in adolescent use of cocaine has been
reported in the 1984 and 1985 surveys of drug use among high
school seniors. The surveys found that current use of cocaine
among respondents climbed from 4.9 percent in 1983 to 5.8 percent
in 1984, and to 6.7 percent 1985. According to the surveys,
annual and lifetime use of cocaine also increased. Health
Consequences of Cocaine Use One reason that use of cocaine is so
widespread is because of the properties of the drug itself.
Cocaine is derived from the leaves of the coca plant
(Erythroxylon coca) and has been identified by Dr. Donald Ian
MacDonald, administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental
Health Administration, as one of the most powerfully addictive
substances known to man. Cocaine is a stimulant traditionally
used to produce euphoria. Other initial effects, however,
typically include excitation, increased alertness, insomnia, loss
of appetite, increased heart rate, increased respiration and
increased blood pressure after even one use. Death can also
result from first time use as discussed below. Repeated use of
cocaine can cause chronic fatigue, convulsions, depression,
irritability, loss of sex drive, memory problems, nasal bleeding,
paranoia, severe headaches, increased body temperature and death.
These symptoms are neither theoretical nor infrequent. Chronic
cocaine use causes tolerance, withdrawal symptoms and addiction.
Tolerance is evidenced by the fact that chronic cocaine users
need to increase their dosage of cocaine to achieve the same
effects as lower dosages. As dosage increases, the effect of
cocaine use become more pronounced. According to cocaine
researcher Dr. Reese T. Jones, &quot;The existence of a true
withdrawal syndrome following cocaine use seems compelling.&quot;
This syndrome includes &quot;depression, social withdrawal,
craving, tremor, muscle pain, eating disturbance,
encephalographic changes and changes in sleep patterns.&quot; </p>

<p>The addictive nature of cocaine and its toxicity have been
documented in both animal studies and human experience. According
to the results of a study reported in the July 5, 1985 issue of
the Journal of the American Medical Association, 90 percent of
rats self-administering cocaine intravenously died within 30
days, while the mortality rate for rats self-administering heroin
was only 36 percent. The study found that rats using cocaine lost
up to 47 percent of their body weight, ceased grooming themselves
and deteriorated in general health. Several rats experienced
seizures, but immediately self-administered more cocaine after
the cessation of convulsions. The study concludes that in regard
to human cocaine use: As the intake of cocaine increases and the
concentration of this compound becomes greater (through the
availability of higher-purity drugs, by IV injections or by
'free-basing') the number of fatalities associated with cocaine
abuse is likely to increase. Hundreds of fatalities each year are
associated with cocaine use. According to Dr. Mark Gold, director
of research at Fair Oaks Hospital in New Jersey: &quot;We have no
way of predicting who'll die from the drug and who won't. It
could be a regular user or it could be a first-time user.&quot;
Although overdose is the primary cause of cocaine deaths, death
can also result after a regular cocaine user takes the same
amount of the drug that he usually takes. This phenomenon is
known as &quot;kindling&quot; and is not well understood by
scientists. According to Miami's Deputy Chief Medical Examiner
Dr. Charles Wetli, &quot;What was a safe dose one day becomes a
fatal dose the next.&quot; The precise cause of cocaine-related
deaths, regardless of dosage, include respiratory failure,
cerebral hemorrhage, cardiac arrest or seizures. Because cocaine
increases blood pressure and heart rate, individuals with
cardiovascular problems are at particular risk. Cocaine's
tendency to induce convulsions also creates special risks for
epileptics. Death by cocaine is often preceded by anxiety,
hallucinations, high body temperature and seizures. One common
myth about cocaine is that addiction and death cannot result from
intranasal use, or &quot;snorting,&quot; which is the most common
route of administration. While cocaine deaths are usually
associated with intravenous use, coroners have documented cases
of death from intranasal use of cocaine. One particular danger
associated with intravenous use of cocaine, or any drug, is
infection. Hepatitis and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) have both been associated with intravenous drug use.
Cultivation The cultivation, refinement and trafficking necessary
to bring cocaine from the fields of South America to the streets
of the United States obviously requires organization. Coca bushes
are grown primarily in the South American countries of Peru,
Bolivia and Colombia. The plants are first harvested as early as
18 months after planting, and can usually be harvested from three
to four times annually for up to 20 years. The cultivation of
coca has increased significantly in recent years, primarily as a
result of the cultivation of new coca plants and the maturation
of previously existing coca plants. Notwithstanding increased law
enforcement pressure in Colombia, the tremendous profits
associated with cocaine trafficking have encouraged the spread of
coca cultivation throughout the region. Processing In a
relatively simple chemical process, coca leaves are converted
first to cocaine paste, then base, then cocaine hydrochloride
(HCl), the form of coca most commonly abused in this country. The
conversion of leaf to paste to base usually occurs near the
cultivation site. The dried leaves are first moistened in an
alkaline solution and then soaked in kerosene. The kerosene is
removed leaving a cocaine precipitate. This in turn is filtered,
producing a paste. The paste is dissolved in a solution of
sulfuric acid and then potassium permanganate. This mixture is
then filtered, ammonium hydroxide is added and the precipitate
that forms is coca base. Traditionally, base has been smuggled
out of Peru and Bolivia by small aircraft or boats to Colombia,
where most of the refining from base to HCl takes place. In
numerous cocaine laboratories in the jungles of Colombia, coca
base is transformed into pure cocaine HCl by adding ether and
acetone, and filtering this mixture, which is then dried. To
produce one kilo of pure cocaine, approximately 500 kilos of coca
leaves are needed. The pattern of processing and transshipment is
somewhat different from that of cultivation. In the area of
refining and smuggling cocaine, it is estimated that 75 percent
of the drug available in the United States comes from Colombia,
15 percent from Bolivia, 5 percent from Peru and 5 percent from
Ecuador, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. However, these figures are
subject to frequent changes because of the mobility of drug
traffickers. For example, while most of the conversion to HCl
takes place in Colombia, and other South American countries, an
increasing number of cocaine laboratories are being seized in the
United States. Six such laboratories were seized here in 1982, 11
in 1983, 21 in 1984 and 25 during the first half of 1985. Reasons
for this trend include increased law enforcement in Colombia and
the increasing cost of ether and acetone in Colombia. The cost of
these chemicals has increased as a result of controls imposed by
the Colombian government on their importation and sale and a
concerted effort initiated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration to disrupt the supply of chemicals essential in
the cocaine refinement process. A 55-gallon drum of ether now
costs approximately $7,000 in South America, while the same
amount costs only $500 to $600 in the United States. Further,
acetone and ether are widely available for commercial purposes in
the United States, making control of their illicit use much more
difficult than it has been in South America. </p>

<p>Heroin </p>

<p>Scope of the Problem </p>

<p>Traditionally viewed as the &quot;hardest drug,&quot; heroin's
reputation is well-earned. Although there are fewer heroin
addicts than users of other illicit drugs, more deaths and
emergency room visits are associated with heroin than with any
other drug. Heroin's &quot;worst drug&quot; status has also
developed because of the crime generally associated with heroin
use, a stereotype of the heroin addict as an inner-city street
dweller who commits crimes as his sole means of support, the fact
that heroin is most often used intravenously, the dramatic
addiction and withdrawal symptoms associated with use of the
drug, and the relatively quick and generally lethal effects of a
heroin overdose. </p>

<p>The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates there were
490,000 heroin addicts and users in 1981. It is estimated that
thousands more individuals use heroin occasionally, but are not
included in this number. While the addict population has remained
relatively steady since 1979, indicators of heroin consumption
and effects have increased in recent years. Annual heroin-related
deaths reached 1,046 in 1984, a 31 percent increase from 1983.
Emergency room visits involving heroin use increased 55 percent
from 1981 to 1984, with 10,901 such visits in 1984. This
represents a decrease from the 11,028 emergency room visits in
1983. Estimated heroin consumption increased 55 percent from 1981
to 1984, with 5.97 metric tons of heroin consumed in 1984. As a
result of increased heroin purity and increased use of the drug
in combination with other drugs, the number of heroin addicts and
the number of deaths and emergency room visits associated with
heroin use should be expected to increase. </p>

<p>Heroin is thus an extremely valuable commodity for organized
crime: in fact, an ounce of pure heroin is approximately ten
times more expensive than an ounce of gold. Heroin users provide
organized crime with billions of dollars each year: it is
estimated that illegal income from heroin sales in the United
States totaled $6.12 billion in 1982. </p>

<p>The Heroin Addict </p>

<p>Historically, data collection and law enforcement experience
support the view that heroin use has been an urban phenomenon,
confined in large part to minority populations. One recent study
of black inner-city heroin users across the country suggests the
extent of heroin's grip in those areas: </p>

<p>Because of the regular availability of heroin and the
structure of the relationship of intercity residents to society,
the heroin lifestyle has become firmly established as an
alternative lifestyle for Black youngsters. </p>

<p>Such studies typically reveal a portrait of the heroin addict
as an unemployed, minority male with little education who commits
crime to support his habit: A 1985 study of heroin users in East
and Central Harlem found the following: 75 percent were male; 55
percent were black and 44 percent Hispanic; 36 percent were under
30 years of age; 61 percent had less than 11 years of education;
and 81 percent were unemployed. The annualized crime rate for
these heroin users was 1,075 crimes per person. Crimes committed
by heroin addicts includes property crime, violent crime and drug
offenses. </p>

<p>While regular use of heroin is generally addictive, there
appears to be a group of users, known as &quot;chippers,&quot;
who are able to use heroin occasionally over a long period of
time without becoming addicts. In his study of heroin, Stanford
University professor John Kaplan maintains: </p>

<p>It is now clear that there exists a sizable population of
non-addicted but regular heroin users who seem well integrated
into society and in many ways indistinguishable from the rest of
the population. </p>

<p>Recently a new group of heroin users has emerged that includes
both addicts and non-addicts. These are the &quot;middle
class&quot; users, who are involved with heroin as a result of
their cocaine habits. In order to counteract the effects of heavy
cocaine use, many began to use heroin intranasally, and
eventually became addicted to the drug. Dr. Forest Tennant,
director of a number of drug abuse clinics in the Los Angeles
area, observes: </p>

<p>As cocaine use increases, we're seeing more addicts because
heroin is the strongest neutralizer around for cocaine toxicity .
. . And we're not talking about gang members and derelicts. I'm
treating people who pay their union dues, go to the PTA, take
their kids to Little League. We've even got a program for
executives. </p>

<p>Health Effects of Heroin Use </p>

<p>While narcotics serve an essential medicinal purpose as
analgesics, or painkillers, they are often abused. Heroin, the
most abused opiate, is derived from the opium poppy (Papaver
somniferum). Heroin is generally used intravenously, the most
efficient and dangerous route of administration.
&quot;Speedballs,&quot; injections of heroin mixed with cocaine,
are particularly dangerous. Heroin can also be used
subcutaneously, called &quot;skin-popping.&quot; All of these
intravenous forms of use are associated with AIDS and hepatitis,
as discussed earlier. In addition, heroin can be smoked or used
intranasally. </p>

<p>Heroin is a particularly dangerous drug because of the ease
with which a user can overdose, A lethal dose of heroin is only
10 to 15 times a normal dose. According to Dr. Donald C. Thomas
III, former director of emergency care at the District of
Columbia General Hospital: </p>

<p>Heroin numbs you to pain, gives you a euphoria, takes you away
from reality, makes you slower and changes appetites . . . The
real problem for an addict is that the threshold between the dose
of heroin that gives that effect, as opposed to the dose that
will kill him by suppressing respiratory or cardiac centers in
his brain, is very narrow. </p>

<p>Multiple overdose deaths sometimes result from one
&quot;batch&quot; of heroin. In March 1985, for example,
according to local press accounts, 8 people died and 14 were
hospitalized in a few days in Washington, D.C., after injecting
some particularly potent heroin. Seven months earlier, 10 people
died in Washington within 8 days in a similar incident. It is
striking evidence of the drug's overpowering influence that this
risk of sudden death apparently poses no deterrent to the
seasoned user. As expressed by one heroin addict: </p>

<p>A true, full-blown drug addict would follow a morgue wagon to
its origin of overdose to obtain that substance. </p>

<p>Cultivation </p>

<p>Heroin entering the United States is produced from opium
poppies, which are harvested in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan
(Southwest Asia, the Golden Crescent); Burma, Thailand and Laos
(Southeast Asia, the Golden Triangle); and Mexico. In 1984, an
estimated 51 percent of United States heroin came from Southwest
Asia, 32 percent from Mexico and 17 percent from Southeast Asia. </p>

<p>From 1983 to 1984 illicit opium production decreased in
Southwest Asia. This change resulted from decreased figures for
opium production in Afghanistan caused by adverse weather
conditions and a change in the methodology used to estimate opium
production in Afghanistan. While total opium production for
Southwest Asia decreased in 1984, significant production
increases were noted in Southeast Asia and Mexico. </p>

<p>Opium poppy cultivation has begun to appear in the United
States as well. During a Federal raid in August 1985, more than
4,000 opium plants were discovered in Vermont, Washington,
Michigan and California. Although officials of the Drug
Enforcement Administration believe this opium was used for
smoking, the potential for domestic heroin production exists. </p>

<p>While America's heroin addict population has remained
relatively stable, the problem of heroin addiction in Europe has
increased significantly in recent years. According to a 1984
United Nations report: </p>

<p>The drug abuse and trafficking situation in Western Europe is
grim and deteriorating . . . Western Europe remains seriously
affected by heroin abuse which is a major public health problem. </p>

<p>The number of heroin addicts in the opium producing and other
countries is also significant. </p>

<p>There is a greater sense of the need for international
cooperation on the problem of drugs, in part because drug
producing nations are now feeling the effects of drug abuse, with
which the industrialized world has dealt for decades. This
development is critical if drug control efforts, including crop
eradication, interdiction and drug education, are to be
successful. </p>

<p>Processing </p>

<p>The production of heroin begins after the petals of the opium
poppy flower have fallen. Several incisions are then made in the
seed pod from which sap oozes. The sap dries, darkens and becomes
gummy, and is scraped from the pod. This dried sap is raw opium.
Each pod can be incised up to five different times. </p>

<p>To produce one kilogram of heroin, a precipitating agent is
added to 10-12 kilograms of opium. This mixture is pressed,
leaving one kilogram of morphine base. This base is treated with
acetic anhydride, which yields one kilogram of heroin. In another
production method, poppies are allowed to mature and dry.
Alkaloids are then extracted from these plants leaving poppy
straw concentrate, which is sold in a brownish powder form. </p>

<p>Marijuana </p>

<p>Scope of the Problem </p>

<p>According to the most recent National Survey on Drug Abuse,
which was conducted in 1982, 50-60 million Americans,
approximately 20-25 percent of the entire population, have tried
marijuana; and 20 million people use the drug at least once per
month. Marijuana use has been widespread in this country for the
last two decades. Both the number of users and the duration of
marijuana's popularity indicate that marijuana use is firmly
entrenched in American society. </p>

<p>Although some surveys indicate that the number of marijuana
users has been declining recently, levels of use remain
significantly higher than for any other illicit drug. The
National Survey on Drug Abuse indicates a decline in marijuana
use for some age groups. Yet the survey shows that in 1982, 11.5
percent of 12-17-year-olds and 27 percent of 18-25 year olds used
marijuana at least once per month. The study indicates a slight,
but steady, increase in marijuana use among people over age 25.
In 1977, 3.3 percent reported monthly marijuana use, compared
with 6.0 percent in 1982. According to the survey of high school
seniors conducted each year by the University of Michigan
Institute for Social Research, marijuana use among high school
seniors peaked in 1978, when 37 percent of these students
reported monthly use of marijuana and 11 percent reported daily
use of the drug. By 1984 these figures had dropped to 25 percent
and 5 percent respectively. However, this decline in marijuana
use ended in 1985 when 26 percent of the survey respondents
reported monthly marijuana use. </p>

<p>Marijuana consumption and the number of marijuana-associated
emergency room visits have remained relatively steady in recent
years. In 1984 Americans consumed an estimated 7,800-9,200 metric
tons of marijuana, as compared with 8,000-9,600 metric tons in
1983. Use of marijuana in conjunction with other drugs,
particularly PCP, diazepam and cocaine, increased in 1984. </p>

<p>The Marijuana User </p>

<p>Marijuana is probably used by a wider demographic
cross-section of American society than any other drug. This
widespread use was recognized by the 1972 National Commission on
Marihuana [sic] and Drug Abuse: </p>

<p>The stereotype of the marihuana [sic] user as a marginal
citizen has given way to a composite picture of large segments of
American youth, children of the dominant majority and very much
part of the mainstream of American life. </p>

<p>While it appears that marijuana, like other drugs, is most
commonly used by those between the ages of 18 and 25, its use is
by no means confined to that age group. One analysis of marijuana
use found that: </p>

<p>Marijuana is now found at the Friday afternoon brainstorming
sessions of a New York publishing house. In the cabs of long-haul
trucks. In the office of a president of a cosmetic firm. Even, it
is alleged, among executives of major American banks. </p>

<p>According to the 1982 National Survey on Drug Abuse, 23
percent of 16 and 17 year olds, 8 percent of 14 and 15 year olds,
and 2 percent of 12 and 13 year olds used marijuana at least once
per month. Surveys have indicated marijuana use in children as
young as nine years old. </p>

<p>Health Effects of Marijuana Use </p>

<p>Marijuana includes any part of the plant Canabis sativa. In
addition to marijuana, the following forms of cannabis are also
abused: hashish, a resin of the plant; hashish oil, a liquid
concentrate derived from cannabis; and sinsemilla, from the
female cannabis plant. </p>

<p>The effects of marijuana use have been the subject of
exaggeration and misunderstanding for decades. In 1936, for
example, the film &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; portrayed those
effects as instant violence and insanity. In 1972 the National
Commission on Marihuana [sic] and Drug Abuse embraced the
opposite extreme: </p>

<p>No conclusive evidence exists of any physical damage,
disturbances of bodily processes or proven human fatalities
attributable solely to even high doses of marijuana . . . [The]
few consistently observed transient effects on bodily function
seem to suggest that marihuana [sic] is a rather unexciting
compound of negligible immediate toxicity at the doses usually
consumed in this country. </p>

<p>Both views have been refuted by medical evidence gathered
since the early 1970's. Today marijuana is described as &quot;the
most chemically complex of all commonly used illegal drugs.&quot;
Marijuana contains 421 known chemicals, which when smoked are
combusted into more than 2,000 chemical compounds. Marijuana is
variously classified as a stimulant, depressant and hallucinogen
because its effects vary among users. </p>

<p>Those chemicals found only in cannabis are called
cannabinoids. The primary intoxicant in marijuana is
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The concentration of The in
marijuana has steadily increased over the last decade as a result
of improved agricultural techniques. Analysis of marijuana
samples indicates that the average percentage of The in marijuana
has increased from .7 percent in 1973, to 3.1 percent in 1982, to
5.6 percent in 1983. The potencies have been reported as high as
14 percent in domestically produced sinsemilla. </p>

<p>Since 1967 when the first intensive government research
program on marijuana began, over 7,000 scientific papers have
been published on the subject. Contrary to the findings of the
1972 National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, adverse
physical and psychological effects associated with marijuana use
have been demonstrated. The measurement of long-term effects of
marijuana use are at present problematic because marijuana
smoking has been prevalent in the United States for only
approximately 15 to 20 years, shorter than the latency period for
many marijuana-related diseases. In the case of tobacco it was
not until after 50 years of heavy use that there was ample
evidence to issue warnings about its effects. </p>

<p>Despite the common public perception that marijuana is less
harmful than tobacco, scientific evidence indicates that
marijuana, in fact, causes substantially more adverse health
effects, due in part to the properties of the drug itself and the
manner in which it is smoked. Marijuana is not filtered, as are
most tobacco cigarettes, and marijuana smoke is generally inhaled
more deeply and held in the lungs longer than tobacco smoke.
Marijuana smoke has been found to contain many of the same
chemicals as tobacco smoke; indeed it has 50 percent more of
cancer-causing hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. </p>

<p>According to the American Lung Association, marijuana smoking
harms the lungs and may cause bronchitis, emphysema and lung
cancer. Evidence supporting this conclusion has been building for
a number of years. For example, a 1976 study reported that
examinations of human lung tissue &quot;have found malignant
cellular changes after shorter periods of exposure to marijuana
smoke than to tobacco smoke.&quot; One comprehensive review of
marijuana projects that: </p>

<p>Starting in the latter 1980's, we predict an increase in the
rate of lung cancer among middle-aged people, representing the
marijuana epidemic that began in the mid-sixties. Those smoking
both tobacco and marijuana are most at risk. </p>

<p>Marijuana use can also adversely affect both male and female
reproduction. Marijuana use by pregnant women is particularly
dangerous and has been linked to lowered birth weight, fetal
abnormalities and nervous disorders in offspring. These adverse
physical effects are magnified because cannabinoids, being fat
soluble, collect in the fatty organs of the body, such as the
testis or ovaries, brain and liver. This is of particular concern
because marijuana is used by a large population of young people
whose lungs, reproductive organs, and other parts of their bodies
are still maturing and are particularly vulnerable to the adverse
effects of drugs. </p>

<p>In addition to these physical effects of marijuana use,
several psychological and behavioral effects have also been
associated with the drug. These behavioral changes have been
called &quot;the amotivational syndrome.&quot; Although lack of
motivation may often precede marijuana use, many clinicians have
concluded that: </p>

<p>Motivational effects are directly related to use and . . .
following cessation of marijuana use normal motivation may
return. </p>

<p>In addition to the effects of marijuana on motivation,
marijuana use has been found to affect short-term memory,
concentration, and logical thinking. A 1982 report concerning the
impact of marijuana use on education concludes that: </p>

<p>Every element of learning is incompatible with either the
acute intoxication or the chronic mental change that marijuana
use can bring. </p>

<p>A 1980 study reported that use of marijuana 20 times or more
per month is &quot;positively correlated with absenteeism and
poor school achievement among high school seniors.&quot; These
conclusions are particularly disturbing given the fact that tens
of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands, of adolescents
use marijuana every day. </p>

<p>A final concern in this area, marijuana's role as a
&quot;gateway&quot; to subsequent use of more dangerous drugs,
cannot be categorized as either physical or psychological. While
many beliefs about marijuana have been proven wrong by subsequent
research, this concept has been affirmed. This
&quot;gateway&quot; theory does not indicate that marijuana use
will definitely lead to the use of other drugs; however,
according to a review of marijuana studies conducted by the
Department of Health and Human Services, </p>

<p>Statistically, there is little question that use, particularly
heavier use, is associated with a likelihood of experimentation
with other drugs. </p>

<p>Synthetic Drugs </p>

<p>Scope of the Problem </p>

<p>Many illicit drugs do not occur naturally. Unlike cocaine,
heroin and marijuana, which are derived from plants, synthetic
drugs are produced solely from chemicals. These synthetic drugs
include stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens, known as
dangerous drugs; synthetic narcotics, such as methadone; and
controlled substance analogs, often called &quot;designer
drugs.&quot; A controlled substance analog has a chemical
structure similar to a controlled substance, and is designed to
produce a similar effect. </p>

<p>Use of synthetic drugs is widespread in the United States.
More than six million Americans used synthetic drugs for
non-medical purposes in 1982. Over 2.5 million people abused
depressants, approximately 2.8 million abused stimulants, and
almost 1 million abused hallucinogens. Consumption of
&quot;dangerous drugs&quot; increased 15 percent between 1983 and
1984, from an estimated 2.66 billion dosage units to 3.06 billion
dosage units. The greatest increases were associated with
methamphetamine and phencyclidine (PCP). Methamphetamine-related
emergency room visits increased 20 percent from 1983 to 1984, and
deaths associated with both amphetamine and methamphetamine also
increased in 1984. </p>

<p>Statistics regarding the use of controlled substance analogs
are difficult to compile. This is because the use of these
substances is a relatively new phenomenon, and medical examiners
have generally failed to identify controlled substance analogs as
a cause of death. Despite these difficulties, one synthetic
analog has been responsible for the deaths of at least 100 people
on the West Coast. While most of these deaths occurred in
California, many law enforcement authorities fear that production
and use of controlled substance analogs might spread across the
country because of the ease of production and large profit margin
associated with these drugs. This spread has already occurred in
at least one instance: drug treatment program directors in
California, Florida, New York, Texas and Virginia have reported
cases of use of the controlled substance analog MDMA. </p>

<p>Synthetic Drug Users </p>

<p>While synthetic drugs are used for a wide range of medicinal
purposes, they are also widely abused by individuals from all
socioeconomic groups. According to a 1978 study of individuals in
treatment for stimulant and/or depressant drug abuse, 68 percent
were men, 61 percent were white, 20 percent black and 19 percent
of another ethnicity, 59 percent were unemployed, 77 percent had
previously been treated for drug abuse, 59 percent were 25 years
of age or older, and 46 percent had less than a twelfth grade
education. </p>

<p>While most people associate heroin use with crime, a 1982
study by the RAND Corporation found violent crime to be committed
most often by multi-drug users, particularly those using
combinations including dangerous drugs. Certain synthetic drugs
are particularly associated with crime. A study of all arrestees
in Washington, D.C., from May 1984 to April 1985 found that PCP,
an hallucinogen, is the drug most often detected in these
arrestees. An average of over 30 percent of all adults arrested
in Washington, D.C., during this period tested positive for PCP
use. A study of almost 5,000 male arrestees in New York City in
1984 found that 12 percent of those arrested had PCP in their
bodies. </p>

<p>Health Effects of Synthetic Drug Use </p>

<p>Tolerance to stimulants develops quickly. Because of the
&quot;crash,&quot; or depression, followed by stimulant use,
users tend to take stimulants more often in order to compensate
for or avoid the post-stimulant letdown. Stimulant users are
subject to a vicious cycle in which they must take depressants at
night to be able to reverse the stimulant's effects. Stimulants
can cause physical dependence and death. Withdrawal is
characterized by depression, fatigue and excessive sleep, which
may last for several days. Other withdrawal symptoms, including
anxiety and thoughts of suicide, may last for weeks or months. </p>

<p>Depressants can also cause tolerance and physical dependence.
Abuse of depressants is marked by impaired judgment, slurred
speech and loss of motor coordination. Depressants are
particularly dangerous when used in combination with alcohol or
other drugs. Heavy use of depressants can cause a weak, rapid
pulse, shallow respiration, coma and death. </p>

<p>Hallucinogens alter mood, and, in large doses, cause delusions
and hallucinations. This impaired judgment can lead a user to
physically harm himself or others. &quot;Flashbacks,&quot; in
which the user has a brief recurrence of the psychedelic effects
of hallucinogens, sometimes occur long after the drug is used.
Tolerance and psychological dependence can also result. PCP,
often called &quot;Angel Dust,&quot; is one of the most dangerous
and widely abused hallucinogens. Reactions to PCP are
unpredictable and include euphoria, depression, anxiety or panic.
PCP use is associated with extremely violent behavior, including
assault, rape, and murder. Feelings of omnipotence sometimes lead
a PCP user to suicidal behavior, including walking in front of
moving vehicles or jumping out of windows. </p>

<p>Controlled substance analogs are designed to mimic the effects
of various drugs and are particularly dangerous because of their
toxicity. One synthetic analog, 3-methyl fentanyl, is up to 1,000
times more potent than morphine. According to Dr. Robert J.
Roberton of California's Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs,
&quot;You could kill 50 people with the amount that fits on the
head of a pin.&quot; </p>

<p>Fentanyl analogs, the most commonly abused controlled
substance analogs, produce a feeling of euphoria similar to that
associated with heroin use. These drugs also produce respiratory
depression and muscle rigidity. MPTP, which is a synthetic analog
of the narcotic meperidine, causes brain damage, Parkinson's
disease and death. Although Parkinson's disease usually strikes
people in their fifties and sixties, people of various ages, who
have used MPTP, have contracted the disease, which causes slowed
movement, tremors, rigidity, dementia and death. The neurological
damage associated with use of MPTP is irreversible. </p>

<p>Drug Abuse Fuels Drug Trafficking </p>

<p>Drug abuse in the United States is a problem of vast and
growing proportions Millions of Americans use cocaine, heroin,
marijuana, or synthetic drugs, or combinations of these drugs.
Consumption of cocaine and dangerous drugs has increased recently
as have the deleterious health effects associated with then. The
downward trend in marijuana use which began in 1979 appears to
have ended at least temporarily in 1985. </p>

<p>Particularly dangerous forms of drug use have increased during
the last few years. Use of &quot;crack,&quot; coca base which is
smoked and which has been called the most potent, addictive, and
cheapest form of cocaine, has become prevalent in the New York
City area. Use of &quot;designer drugs,&quot; some of which have
caused Parkinson's disease, have been blamed for over 100 deaths.
There is evidence of a link between intravenous drug use and the
contraction of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). </p>

<p>Drug abuse affects much more than the individual drug user; it
also impacts on families, communities and entire governments. The
taint of drugs has reached into virtually every aspect of
American life, from public safety to the integrity of
professional sports. These problems and the full range of massive
government and private responses discussed in this report,
including increased education and enforcement efforts, expanded
intelligence and interdiction programs, and diversions of
military resources, costing billions of dollars, is the direct
result of a single cause: the destructive self-indulgence of
individual drug purchasers. Each time a drug user buys cocaine,
heroin, or other drugs, he makes a contribution to organized
crime. Such contributions are the sole sustenance of the
violence, corruption, illness and death that trafficking groups
bring to this and other societies. </p>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter III Part 1: Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime </h2>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Drug trafficking is the most widespread and lucrative
organized crime operation in the United States, accounting for
nearly 40 percent of this country's organized crime activity and
generating an annual income estimated to be as high as $110
billion. Large trafficking organizations dominate the illicit
drug market. These groups include the &quot;families&quot; of
America's La Cosa Nostra, as well as an array of more recently
identified crime groups such as the Sicilian &quot;Mafia,&quot;
outlaw motorcycle gangs and groups based in the Nigerian and
Colombian communities. While La Cosa Nostra has historically been
involved in narcotics trafficking, newer organizations, in many
ways quite different from La Cosa Nostra, now play a major role
in the drug trade. Generally, these newer groups develop solely
around drug trafficking operations and are activity-specific,
dependent only on drug-related criminal activity for income. They
tend to be more fluidly organized than La Cosa Nostra, and are
not as self-contained but are marked by a degree of violence and
corruption unsurpassed by any other criminal activity. </p>

<p>Organized crime groups involved in drug trafficking, however,
share a central feature with other organized crime groups in that
they consist of a core criminal group and a specialized criminal
support designed to facilitate illicit activity. This
&quot;core/support&quot; configuration is one this Commission has
found to be common to all organized crime groups today. </p>

<p>Cocaine Trafficking </p>

<p>America's cocaine supply at present originates exclusively in
South America. Coca is cultivated principally in Peru, Bolivia,
Colombia and Ecuador, and conversion laboratories have been
located in Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela. Other South American
and Caribbean countries serve as transshipment sites. All phases
of the cocaine trade, including cultivation, processing and
distribution have expanded since 1984, and the industry shows no
signs of diminishing despite the fact that cocaine supply already
exceeds consumer demand. </p>

<p>Control of the cocaine industry has traditionally been
maintained by a cartel of Colombian traffickers. Colombian groups
are the largest, wealthiest, most sophisticated organizations
trafficking in cocaine. A key to their domination of the market
has been their control of the processing laboratories used to
convert coca grown traditionally in Bolivia and Peru. Export of
the drug to the United States has also been handled almost
exclusively by Colombian trafficking organizations. While
Colombians currently control an estimated 75 percent of the
cocaine distributed to the United States, their domination has
been lessened recently both by the Colombian government's
imposition of severe restrictions on the importation of chemicals
essential to cocaine processing and by the destruction of cocaine
processing sites throughout Colombia by government authorities.
In 1984 three major Colombian conversion laboratories were
discovered and destroyed: at Tranquilandia, the largest facility,
ten metric tons of cocaine and 10,000 barrels of processing
chemicals were seized. In total, Colombian authorities
confiscated 16 metric tons of cocaine in 1984, a 600 percent
increase from the 2.5 metric tons seized in the previous year.
The pressures on cocaine traffickers were compounded in that year
by the Colombian government's decision to extradite drug
traffickers to the United States, and by the subsequent issuance
of warrants for the arrest of several major traffickers. </p>

<p>Intensified Colombian law enforcement measures have had
significant impact on trafficking operations. The initiatives
have prompted many traffickers to seek refuge in other South
American countries, and in some cases to relocate their
processing laboratories. These incidents have resulted in a
geographic dispersal of cocaine processing and export activities,
most notably to Bolivia and Peru. While it appeared initially
that activity in these countries was sponsored and overseen by
Colombian traffickers, increasing evidence suggests that groups
in both countries are becoming self-sufficient. Such
developments, however, remain an exception to the prevailing
Colombian dominance. </p>

<p>Despite the spread of cocaine activity through South America,
Colombian groups have left little room in the cocaine trade for
small-scale smugglers. While some independent operators and
smaller smuggling groups occasionally work independently of the
Colombian cartel, most are tied to the larger organization in at
least a contractor relationship. </p>

<p>The Colombian Connection: Origins </p>

<p>The Colombian involvement in U.S. cocaine trafficking can be
traced to the influx of Cuban citizens to South Florida after the
Castro Revolution in the early 1960's. Some of the Cuban-settled
communities became bases for the continuation of established
Cuban organized crime networks known as the &quot;Cuban
Mafia.&quot; The Cuban Mafia had been a major distributor of the
cocaine in Cuba, where the drug has long been accepted as a
social luxury, and thus had existing connections with South
American cocaine trafficking organizations. At first, the Florida
Cuban Mafia factions imported only enough cocaine to satisfy
members of their own community, but by the mid-1960's, they began
to import greater quantities of the drug in an effort to expand
distribution and increase profit. By 1965 Colombians supplied
nearly 100 percent of the cocaine moving through the Cuban
networks. Colombians refined the drug and Cubans trafficked and
distributed it in the United States. The system worked for a
time, but the Colombians increasingly desired control of the
entire operation. Through the late 1960's and early 1970's they
became more involved in cocaine production, and increased their
trafficking role. By 1978 Colombian traffickers had cut all ties
with the Cubans and assumed the dominant role they now play in
supplying cocaine to the American market. </p>

<p>Colombian groups have continued to control the U.S. cocaine
market through the 1980's for a number of reasons.
Geographically, Colombia is well-positioned both to receive coca
from Peru and Bolivia and to export the processed drug to the
United States either by air or by sea. In addition, the country's
vast central forests effectively conceal clandestine processing
laboratories and air strips, which facilitate the traffic.
Perhaps most importantly, the Colombians have a momentum by
benefit of their early involvement in the cocaine trade. They
have evolved from small, disassociated groups into
compartmentalized organizations and are sophisticated and
systematized in their approach to trafficking cocaine in the
United States. Further, groups in the Colombian population in the
U.S. provide traffickers access to this country and often serves
as a distribution network for Colombian cocaine. </p>

<p>The Colombian Organization </p>

<p>The major Colombian trafficking organizations are structured
to control each intermediate step required in processing and
exporting cocaine. Like traditional organized crime groups, they
are built of interdependent and essential component
&quot;divisions,&quot; each with a specialized area of
responsibility. Different members act as laborers, processors,
transporters, financiers and enforcers. In addition,
organizations generally supplement their regular membership with
criminal support of affiliates who perform services on a fee
basis. Few members of any organizational division are aware of
the others involved in the enterprise, and trafficking bosses are
well-insulated and protected by their organizations. </p>

<p>Organization laborers and processors prepare cocaine for U.S.
consumption. Most laborers in the cultivation phase are Peruvian
or Bolivian peasants who cultivate and harvest coca in remote
areas of the Eastern Andes, then process the coca leaves to base
in nearby villages. The growers are allied in small, independent
groups, but are typically financed, overseen, and protected by
members of a larger Colombian organization. </p>

<p>Processed coca base is usually flown on light aircraft from
the mountain villages to Colombian processing facilities by those
members of the Colombian organization responsible for
transportation. The planes land at clandestine airstrips, often
simple mud runways, located near the processing laboratories. The
laboratories vary widely in size, ranging from crude
small-quantity operations to large, sophisticated complexes, and
can be found both in Colombia's jungle and urban areas. </p>

<p>Coca base is typically processed to cocaine hydrochloride in
the laboratories, then bagged and taped into kilogram packages,
which are sometimes coded to indicate a particular United States
destination. The packages are loaded into duffle bags or burlap
sacks, then moved by the transportation group to a &quot;stash
house,&quot; a storage facility usually located near a seaport or
a clandestine airstrip. The cocaine is held at the stash house
until it is exported from Colombia. </p>

<p>Colombian trafficking organizations currently export an
estimated 62 percent of the cocaine they process on private
aircraft. The remaining 38 percent is shipped on ocean vessels or
smuggled on commercial air carriers. Most shipments are smuggled
out of Colombia from the country's northern coastal region, the
Guajira peninsula. Principal smuggling centers include the cities
of Santa Marta, Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Medellin. In
addition, a significant percentage of processed cocaine leaves
Colombia from airstrips located near larger processing facilities
in the jungles. </p>

<p>Typically, Colombian organizations oversee each cocaine
shipment from cultivation through wholesale transactions in the
United States. Retail and street-level sales are handled by a
variety of smaller groups and individuals in this country. </p>

<p>The money generated by the wholesale cocaine transaction is
maintained for the organization by financial experts familiar
with international banking, who are responsible for laundering,
banking and investing drug profits, and for assuring that a
portion of the drug profit is returned to Colombia for
reinvestment in the organization's cocaine enterprise. The
cartel's own financial experts are supported by a complement of
bankers, lawyers and other professionals in the United States,
who play a crucial role in facilitating these transactions. </p>

<p>Colombian trafficking organizations, like other organized
crime groups, rely on &quot;enforcement&quot; through violence
and intimidation to protect their inventory and profits.
&quot;Enforcement&quot; occurs both in Colombia and in the United
States and includes the collection of debts owed to the
organization and the elimination of interference from
competitors, informants and law enforcement officials. </p>

<p>Pilots: The American Affiliates </p>

<p>Cocaine is ordinarily smuggled from South America to the
United States for major trafficking organizations by American
citizens acting as mercenary pilots. Recruits include
ex-military, commercial and private pilots, and in some cases,
unlicensed aviators. The speed, mobility and evasive capabilities
of air transport have made it the preferred node of shipment
among Colombian traffickers, and many have built airstrips either
near their processing centers or along the coastlines to permit
the fast direct export of cocaine. On Colombia's north coast
alone, over 150 clandestine landing strips and three
international airports facilitate smuggling activities. </p>

<p>Individual pilots are generally responsible for purchasing or
leasing transportation vehicles and hiring flight crews.
Obtaining a plane for purchase seldom presents any difficulty,
since many aircraft are regularly advertised for sale in a number
of trade periodicals. One popular journal, Trade-a-Plane, is
published three times each month and advertises thousands of
aircraft available for sale in each issue. Planes are also
available for purchase at numerous government auctions of seized
properties. These events often allow traffickers to repurchase
aircraft, which they were previously forced to forfeit. </p>

<p>Because traffickers attempt to ship the largest possible
quantities of cocaine to the widest range of destinations in the
United States, the aircraft selected for smuggling generally
represent the optimum balance between range and cargo capacity.
The most popular of these are conventional light twin engine
planes, such as the Piper Aztec, Piper Navajo and the Cessna 400
series. Most such planes can transport about a ton of cocaine
over a range of about 1,800 miles and can stay airborne for 11
and one hours with standard fuel systems. Larger airplanes such
as DC-3 aircraft are common on shuttle flights between the United
States and various transshipment points; the fastest aircraft are
always preferred when available. </p>

<p>To maximize range and capability, smuggling planes are often
outfitted with auxiliary fuel systems. These auxiliary systems
may be attached to the outside body of the aircraft or the wing,
but must be inspected and approved by the Federal Aviation
Administration each time the outfitted aircraft prepares for
flight. A favored auxiliary system for cocaine traffickers is the
collapsible rubber fuel &quot;bladder,&quot; which may be placed
in the plane's fuselage, and simply folded up or thrown away
after the fuel contained within is used. The space occupied by
the bladder on the trip to Colombia can be utilized for cocaine
transport on the return journey. Bladders are, under all
circumstances, prohibited by Federal law. </p>

<p>Although the legitimate need for auxiliary fuel systems is
very limited, the systems are well-advertised and readily
available. One trafficker told the Commission he purchased
bladders and other long-range fuel systems regularly, always
paying the seller with &quot;suitcases full of cash.&quot; He
claims his cash was never questioned or refused. </p>

<p>Traffic From Colombia to the United States: The Hydra's Head </p>

<p>Smugglers use a vast number of both air and sea trafficking
routes to transport cocaine from South America to the United
States. The most commonly travelled routes are through the
Windward Passage between Cuba and Haiti, through the Yucatan
Channel between Mexico and Cuba, and through the Mona Passage,
bordered by the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. </p>

<p>Traditionally, 90 percent of the cocaine shipped by these
routes has entered the United States at points along the Florida
coast; traffickers now, however, more frequently deliver
shipments to all the States along the Gulf Coast and elsewhere
throughout this country. Cocaine traffic also now runs directly
from Colombia's west coast to California and other western
states. These shifts are perceived as a response by traffickers
to increased law enforcement pressure in South Florida,
specifically to the intensified efforts of the South
Florida/Caribbean Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.
The theme is a common one: as law enforcement closes off one
point of entry to drug traffickers, traffickers develop many new
points of entry as replacements. </p>

<p>Air Shipment </p>

<p>Nearly two-thirds of the cocaine exported from South America
to the United State is transported by general aviation aircraft.
Planes of all sizes, ranging from small turbo-prop craft to large
C-123 cargo transport planes, are used for drug shipment. Small
aircraft, which cannot carry adequate fuel to allow direct flight
from Colombia to the United States, must refuel at transshipment
points between the two countries. These contact points are
indispensable, and are located throughout Central America, the
Dominican Republic, Cuba, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico.
Transshipment points may be simply refueling stations, or may be
bases or stations equipped to allow cocaine off-loading and
repackaging. From the transshipment points, cocaine is generally
ferried to the United States by small planes or boats. </p>

<p>Mexico has gained popularity as a transshipment point since
1980. Although coca cultivation has not been observed in Mexico,
an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the cocaine exported to the
United States currently transits that country. Three Mexican
transshipment patterns are typical. First, Mexican traffickers
obtain cocaine in South America, transport it to Mexico, then
traffic the drug overland into the United States. Second,
Colombian or American couriers travel by commercial aircraft from
South America to Mexico, then cross the border into this country.
Finally, Colombian or North American traffickers use Mexico's
numerous clandestine airstrips, especially in Yucatan, for
refueling and for loading purposes; the smuggling plane in use
may continue directly into the United States, or the shipment may
be broken into smaller loads, then trafficked overland by Mexican
organizations. The majority of cocaine shipped through Mexico is
transported to the United States by car, truck or bus, but a
significant amount is smuggled aboard small aircraft. The Mexican
groups, formerly limited primarily to trafficking heroin and
marijuana, have eagerly expanded their role as middlemen between
Colombian traffickers and American consumers. </p>

<p>Maritime Shipment </p>

<p>An estimated 18 percent (15 tons in 1984) of the cocaine
trafficked into the United States is exported from South America
by sea vessel. All types of ships are used for smuggling, from
small high-speed cigarette boats to large commercial cargo
carriers. Colombians dominate maritime cocaine smuggling, and
most shipments depart that country's north coastline, which
features three major seaports and countless debarkation ports for
smaller craft. Approximately one-half of the cocaine exported by
sea is concealed in commercial vessels, and a smaller percentage
is shipped in private boats which are frequently outfitted with
special compartments designed for drug storage. Small amounts of
cocaine are also often shipped on with marijuana on
non-commercial smuggling vessels. </p>

<p>Maritime trafficking routes have shifted significantly in the
past five years, primarily in response to increased law
enforcement surveillance. While a major portion of the maritime
traffic formerly flowed directly into South Florida, traffickers
now increasingly use the longer eastern routes through the
Caribbean to the Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts, as well as
direct routes to the U.S. west coast. These routes make smuggling
more expensive for traffickers, since they require larger
vessels, larger crews and more sophisticated electronic
equipment. </p>

<p>Case Study: Devoe Airlines </p>

<p>Devoe Airlines was a scheduled commuter air service operating
between Miami and smaller Florida cities during the early 1980's.
Owned by Miami pilot Jack Devoe, the business was essentially a
front for a Colombian drug trafficking operation, which included
regular large quantity marijuana and cocaine smuggling. In total,
8 to 10 contract pilots employed by Devoe were involved in over
100 trafficking flights over a five year period and carried
roughly 7,000 pounds of cocaine from South America to the United
States. Jack Devoe estimates that his flying organization grossed
millions of dollars each month during peak smuggling periods. </p>

<p>Devoe's trafficking pilots initially travelled non-stop routes
between the United States and Colombia, but developed a
transshipment point on Little Derby Island in the Bahamas for
purposes of &quot;security . . . [and] police protection&quot; in
the 1980's. Devoe hired six to eight employees to work as needed
at the island base to unload and repackage drug shipments. There
was no interference from Bahamian law enforcement at the Little
Darby base &quot;as long as the payments [to officials] were on
time.&quot; </p>

<p>Typically operating mid-size turbo-prop aircraft, Devoe pilots
departed for Colombia either from the base at Little Derby Island
or from Florida airports. Their route took them through the
Windward Passage generally to Colombian locations about 60 miles
south of the equator. In the early stages of the operation,
landings were made at official Colombian airports including the
airfields at Santa Marta and Riohacha. In at least one instance,
cocaine was openly loaded onto the smuggling aircraft at Riohacha
airport. In the early 1980's Devoe shifted landings to
clandestine jungle airstrips maintained by the organization's
cocaine supplier, Pepe Cabrera. This system streamlined the
trafficking process by eliminating transport of the cocaine to an
airport. The cocaine shipment was loaded directly onto the
aircraft near the strip, where the plane was simultaneously
prepared for the return flight. </p>

<p>Generally, Devoe pilots returned to the United States within
one day. Their preferred return route extended along the
Colombia/Venezuela border, over Haiti, and to the Bahamian base
on Little Derby Island. There, cocaine was sealed into the wing
fuel tanks of a small aircraft and flown directly into South
Florida for delivery to the cartel's representative there. </p>

<p>The Devoe organization's methods for avoiding interdiction
between South America and the United States were relatively
simple and typical of such smuggling operations. A Devoe pilot
learned the frequencies of DEA surveillance aircraft on one
occasion by &quot;acting like a helicopter buff&quot; inspecting
a DEA Cobra pursuit helicopter parked near the Devoe hangar.
Inside the helicopter the pilot copied the frequencies from a
clipboard hanging on the instrument panel. As the pilot explained
to the Commission: </p>

<p>By [subsequently] using our scanner and our knowledge of the
frequencies in use, we could monitor the activities of DEA planes
. . . we could learn not only the activities of the planes, but
also go up and check the plane out. By learning what types of
aircraft DEA was using we could plan our own strategy more
effectively . . . </p>

<p>Devoe also regularly sent &quot;cover-flight&quot; aircraft
ahead of the smuggling planes along the trafficking route to
monitor DEA and Customs Service surveillance patrols by radio.
These planes, which carried no drug cargo, were also used to
decoy pursuit aircraft. Once in the United States, Devoe strategy
for clearing Customs inspection was to: </p>

<p>&quot;. . . act normally and file a flight plan, come in and
land, and let them inspect the airplane . . . Customs inspectors
were far less interested in a lengthy examination of my plane if
I came in on a Sunday afternoon in the middle of the televised
football game. If the Dolphins were playing, that was even
better.&quot; </p>

<p>Using these tactics, Devoe Airlines was able to complete over
100 trafficking flights from Colombia without interference from
law enforcement authorities. </p>

<p>Case Study: Barry Seal </p>

<p>Adler Berriman Seal, a former TWA 747 captain, flew cocaine
from Colombia to the United States for over seven years during
the late 1970's and early 1980's. Seal was recruited as a
trafficking pilot by a personal friend who worked for the
Colombian cocaine trafficking organization headed by Jorge Ochoa,
and eventually worked directly with that organization's
leadership. </p>

<p>Initially, Seal flew direct trafficking flights between
Louisiana, and Colombia. He piloted a number of different
smuggling aircraft, the largest of which was a Vietnam-vintage
C-123 capable of holding tons of packaged cocaine. Seal always
departed and returned to his Louisiana base at night to reduce
chances of interdiction. His typical route took him over the
Yucatan Peninsula (not over the more heavily patrolled Yucatan
channel) and directly over Central America to the eastern tip of
Honduras, then south to any one of a number of airstrips and
airports in north central Colombia. </p>

<p>According to Seal, the Ochoa organization paid Colombian
officials bribes of $10,000 to $25,000, per flight for a
&quot;window,&quot; i.e., a specific time, position and altitude
designated for the smuggling flight's penetration of the
Colombian air space. If this payment was not made, the aircraft
was susceptible to interception by Colombian authorities. Seal
generally arrived in Colombia at dawn. His aircraft was loaded
with cocaine and refueled within an hour, sometimes within
fifteen minutes; and he returned immediately to the United
States. </p>

<p>Seal used two fairly simple techniques to avoid interdiction
on his return trip to the United States: both were effective
because of the heavy helicopter traffic running between the Gulf
Coast States and the hundreds of oil rigs located off shore.
First, when he reached the middle of the Gulf on his return trip,
Seal slowed his aircraft to 110-120 knots and was thus perceived
by monitoring radar as a helicopter, not a plane. Secondly, at a
distance of about 50 miles off the United States coast, he
dropped the aircraft to an altitude of 500-1000 feet in order to
co-mingle with the helicopter traffic, and thereby arouse even
less suspicion. </p>

<p>Once in United States airspace, Seal proceeded to prearranged
points 40 to 50 miles inland. The points were mapped out in
advance with Loran C, a long-range navigational instrument.
Further inland, he was generally joined by a helicopter. The two
aircraft proceeded to a drop zone, where the helicopter hovered
close to the ground. Seal then dropped the load of cocaine from
the airplane on a parachute; the helicopter picked up the load
from the drop zone and delivered it to waiting automobiles, which
eventually moved the cocaine to Miami. Seal proceeded to land his
drug-free aircraft at any nearby airport. </p>

<p>Seal was well paid for his services. He claims his top fee for
smuggling a kilogram of cocaine was $5,000; an average load was
300 kilograms. His most profitable single load netted him $1.5
million. He was never apprehended in connection with this
operation. </p>

<p>Specialized Electronics: The Smuggler's Edge </p>

<p>Like many trafficking pilots today, both Seal and Devoe relied
on sophisticated electronic equipment to maintain and secure
communications within their organization and to monitor law
enforcement surveillance efforts. Most devices used, while
expensive, are readily available in the United States, and
trafficking organizations, of course, fund the purchase of any
equipment that will facilitate their operations. Seal, for
example, once spent over $200,000 cash on communication and
surveillance equipment for the Ochoa cocaine trafficking
organization here in the United States in a two-day period.
Payments for this type of equipment are almost always made in
cash - sometimes suitcases full of cash - and are rarely refused.
</p>

<p>The communication devices most commonly used by traffickers
include state of the art radio equipment, communication
scramblers, pocket pagers and encrypting devices. The equipment
is used to prevent law enforcement interception of communication
between traffickers. A scrambler, for example, attaches to an
ordinary radio, and &quot;scrambles&quot; the normal radio
frequency with a number of different codes. Only someone with a
receiver coded to the particular scrambler frequency can decipher
the transmitted message; the transmission is unintelligible to
all other receivers. Digital encryption devices are used to send
messages in code, and are often secured so that they can be
accessed only after a security number is punched directly into
the device. The security feature allows only members of the
trafficking organization, who know the access code, to send or
decipher coded messages. The speed with which a digital message
is transmitted precludes radio tracking, at least by traditional
triangulation. </p>

<p>Among the other specialized devices used by traffickers to
detect and avoid law enforcement surveillance are radar
altimeters, beacon-interrogating digital radar, position tracking
equipment and long-range navigation instruments. Latest
generation night vision goggles are also frequently used by
traffickers flying at low altitudes in darkness. The strap-on
goggles intensify any available light by a factor of 50,000 and
greatly reduce a smuggler's risk of interdiction by allowing him
to fly his aircraft without lights. </p>

<p>The Combined Effort </p>

<p>A number of independent Colombian trafficking organizations,
among them the largest and most powerful operations, work in
collaboration on individual smuggling ventures. As described by
DEA special agent Michael Fredericks, the resulting organization
is fluid: </p>

<p>There is a level of organization that may involve . . . a
handful of people at the top. . . Below that level . . . there
are many workers who move between one organization and another. .
. It seems that in the Colombian organizations, a laboratory
operator may work for 1 [specific] trafficker . . . and not even
be aware of it simple because of the levels of insulation. </p>

<p>At the time of the preparation of this report, three men,
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasques, and
Carlos Enrique Lehder-Rivas, were reported to control the most
significant trafficking organizations in Colombia. Known as
&quot;Los Grandes Mafiosos&quot; in the Colombian press, each
directs a separate organization, but the organizations work in
concert and exchange personnel and equipment in various instances
to maximize efficiency and profit. The resulting cartel system
affords these traffickers numerous advantages, among them control
over the price and the quality of Colombian cocaine, greater
access to smuggling and processing equipment, and a wide variety
of methods by which to avoid law enforcement. </p>

<p>A chart detailing a temporary cooperative venture based in
Medellin, Colombia, between the Pablo Escobar organization and
the Jorge Ochoa organization was confiscated from a mid-level
trafficker involved in the operation, and was provided to the
Commission by the Drug Enforcement Administration (Figure 2). As
diagrammed, the Escobar and Ochoa organizations combined and
divided the trafficking responsibilities typically completed by a
single organization. The same component parts - labor,
processing, transportation, finance and enforcement - were
carried over from the individual organizations, with the Escobar
group taking responsibility for production activities, and the
Ochoa group handling enforcement and finances. </p>

<p>Colombia Cracks Down </p>

<p>Through the 1970's cocaine traffickers operated throughout
Colombia with little interference, and in fact with considerable
support from the Colombian government. The situation changed in
April 1984 when drug traffickers assassinated Colombia's Minister
of Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. Lara's assassination came two
months after he authorized a raid on a major cocaine processing
plant known as Tranquilandia in Southeastern Colombia's Llanos
region, which resulted in the destruction of over $1 billion
worth of cocaine. Following Lara's assassination, Colombian
President Belisario Betancur Cuartas declared a &quot;war without
quarter&quot; on all drug smugglers and signed extradition orders
for a number of known major traffickers. President Betancur also
shifted trafficking trials to Colombia's military courts,
increased eradication and interdiction efforts within his
country, and increased regulation of those chemicals necessary
for processing coca base into cocaine. </p>

<p>President Betancur's actions have had important ramifications
both for traffickers and for other South and Central American
governments. When the intensified Colombian programs became
effective, a number of major traffickers, among them Escobar,
Lehder and Ochoa, went into hiding and moved their processing
operations to neighboring countries. In 1984 processing
laboratories as well as stockpiles of essential conversion
chemicals were discovered and destroyed in Panama, Venezuela,
Mexico and Canada. Evidence suggests that significant processing
activity is now also taking place in Nicaragua and Brazil. The
Colombian regulation of ether and other essential precursor
chemicals has resulted in an increase in cocaine processing
activity in the United States: 21 processing laboratories were
discovered and destroyed in South Florida in 1984 as opposed to
11 in 1983. </p>

<p>In March 1985 despite his status as a fugitive, Carlos Lehder
appeared on Colombian television, filmed live from a jungle
clearing by a Spanish film crew. Lehder used the television
opportunity, which he had arranged, to appeal to the Colombian
revolutionary organizations to participate in the &quot;cocaine
bonanza . . . the arm of the struggle against America.&quot; He
also characterized cocaine as the &quot;Achilles heel of American
imperialism.&quot; Lehder disappeared into the jungle after the
interview and remains at large, presumably in the remote jungles
of Colombia. </p>

<p>Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p>Traditional Organized Crime: La Cosa Nostra and the French
Connection </p>

<p>Heroin trafficking in this country first became big business
in the 1920's, when organized criminals based in New York City's
Jewish community began to control the importation and
distribution of the drug. By the late 1930's, La Cosa Nostra
joined the Jewish groups in the heroin enterprise, importing the
drug from France, Asia and the Mideast. When these sources became
inaccessible during World War II, Mexico became the major U.S.
heroin supplier. </p>

<p>After the war, La Cosa Nostra took control of America's heroin
market, this time importing most of its drug supply from Italian
refineries. When the Italian government banned the manufacture of
heroin in the early 1950's, La Cosa Nostra traffickers were
forced to look to other sources. A new system was quickly
devised, by which Turkish morphine base was refined to heroin in
Marseilles, then shipped to Montreal or Sicily. Organized crime
groups located in these transshipment points then sent the heroin
directly to the United States. This arrangement, popularly known
as the &quot;French Connection,&quot; allowed La Cosa Nostra to
monopolize the heroin trade from the 1980's through the early
1970's. During the peak French Connection years, the LCN
controlled an estimated 95 percent of all of the heroin entering
New York City, as well as most of the heroin distributed
throughout the United States. </p>

<p>The La Cosa Nostra heroin monopoly lasted until 1972, when
under diplomatic pressure from the United States, Turkey banned
opium production and the French Connection collapsed. Amsterdam
replaced Marseilles as the center of European heroin traffic, and
Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami joined New York City as major U.S.
distribution centers. Other trafficking groups rose to compete
with the LCN for heroin dollars in New York City and throughout
the country. </p>

<p>Source Country Traffickers: Mexico </p>

<p>In the five years after the collapse of the French Connection,
Mexico became the major source of U.S. heroin. Mexico's rise was
logical: the country contains extensive regions suitable for both
opium cultivation and refining and shares a lightly guarded 2,000
mile border with the United States. Mexicans could manufacture
heroin and smuggle it into the United States with little risk of
detection. This simplified trafficking system resulted in
increased Mexican heroin availability in the United States. </p>

<p>For generations, opium has been grown in remote areas of
Mexico's Sierra Madre Mountain states of Durango, Sinaloa and
Chihuahua. Culiacan, on the western side of the Sierra Madre, and
Durango to the east, developed in the 1970's as major production
centers for heroin destined for U.S. distribution. Trafficking
organizations are now entrenched in these areas, and are involved
in all phases of the heroin manufacture and distribution process.
Opium gum is collected by peasants in isolated mountain areas and
is transported by mule or carried by hand to nearby mountain
villages. Typically, village middlemen sell the opium to a drug
trafficking organization boss, who moves drugs to an
organization-held laboratory for processing to heroin. Mexican
couriers then transport the heroin to the members of the
trafficking organization in the United States. The major Mexican
heroin trafficking organizations supplying heroin to America are
generally extended familial organizations, but loyal workers
sometimes are given status as &quot;quasi-family&quot; members of
the groups. The organizations work to eliminate competition and
to control as completely as possible all aspects of the heroin
trade. Members act as opium cultivators, village middlemen, and
heroin brokers and distributors. In the United States, the
organization typically controls distribution from the wholesaler
to the retail distributor, but has little or no involvement in
street distribution. This is seen as an unnecessarily risky and
low-profit aspect of the business, and is left to outsiders. </p>

<p>Violence is an integral part of Mexican trafficking.
Organization members provide cultivators with semi-automatic and
automatic weapons to protect their crops; weapons are used
throughout the trafficking system to eliminate informants, and to
intimidate competitors and law enforcement officials. Corruption
of Mexican police officials is well-documented and is essential
to the smooth operation of the Mexican trafficking organizations.
</p>

<p>In 1984, Mexican traffickers provided 32 percent share of the
heroin consumed in the United States. The figure is expected to
rise over the next several years due to the continued devaluation
of the peso and improved agricultural technology. </p>

<p>Case Study: The Herrera Family </p>

<p>Since the early 1970's the Jamie Herrera-Navarres organization
has been a major heroin smuggling power operative between Mexico
and the United States. The Herrera organization is a
confederation of families related by blood and marriage, although
some non-family members have been accepted into the group over
time. Older family members process opium and morphine base,
younger members handle the drug sales and shipments in Mexico and
in the United States. The Herrera organization is now estimated
to have 3,000 to 5,000 members, a significant portion of whom are
naturalized American citizens and illegal aliens residing in this
country. </p>

<p>Despite the 1978 conviction and incarceration of Jamie
Herrera, and several key family members, the organization remains
active. In July 1985, 135 persons in the United States,
comprising eight separate Herrera-related distribution rings,
were indicted in Chicago on drug trafficking charges. These
Herrera groups allegedly trafficked heroin and marijuana from
Mexico through El Paso to a middleman in Texas. From Texas, the
drugs were shipped to Chicago, then distributed throughout the
country. This Herrera enterprise, only a small fragment of the
total organization, is estimated to have had gross annual profits
of over $200 million. The arrests are expected to have a
significant effect on the Herrera organization, if only on a
temporary basis. </p>

<p>Source Country Traffickers: Southeast Asia </p>

<p>Mexican heroin production decreased in the late 1970's due to
enforcement, eradication and poor weather conditions. By 1980,
Mexico provided only 25 percent of the heroin consumed in the
United Stated, down from a peak level of 80 percent in 1975. At
the same time, heroin production in Southeast Asia accelerated
dramatically. By 1976, the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; of Burma,
Thailand and Laos supplied more than a third of the heroin
consumed in the United States; Mexico supplied the remainder.
Golden Triangle heroin first gained popularity with American
servicemen stationed in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War
because it was readily available, inexpensive, and considerably
more pure than Mexican heroin. After the war, Golden Triangle
heroin was exported to the United States in increasing amounts. </p>

<p>Nearly 90 percent of the Golden Triangle opium is currently
produced in Burma. Two-thirds of this crop is produced in the
northeast area of the country, where control is shared by the
Burmese Communist Party (BCP) and the Shan United Army (SUA).
Both groups were at one time political insurgent organizations
but are now almost entirely devoted to obtaining profit for the
production, smuggling and sale of heroin base. They derive
considerable income from &quot;taxes&quot; and fees they levy on
opium growers and heroin producers and traffickers. This income
is used to purchase weapons, to be utilized not in furtherance of
political goals, but for protection of each group's narcotics
enterprise. Traditionally, the two groups have coexisted
peacefully: the BCP has acted as the major opium supplier in
Southeast Asia and the SUA has been the area's major refiner and
trafficker. The BCP has recently become involved in refining and
distribution activities, and the organizations are currently in
conflict. </p>

<p>Opium and morphine base produced in northeastern Burma
transported by horse and donkey caravans to refineries along the
Thailand-Burma border for conversion to heroin and heroin base.
Most of the finished products are shipped across the border into
various towns in North Thailand and down to Bangkok for further
distribution to international markets. In the past major ethnic
Chinese traffickers in Bangkok have controlled much of the
foreign sales and movement of Southeast Asian heroin from
Thailand, but a combination of law enforcement pressure,
publicity and a regional drought has significantly reduced their
role. As a consequence, many less-predominant traffickers in
Bangkok and other parts of Thailand now control smaller
quantities of the heroin going to international markets. </p>

<p>Although Thailand is the primary transit center for Southeast
Asian heroin destined for international markets, alternate
trafficking routes are increasingly utilized as a result of
Thailand's sustained enforcement actions. Some opium, morphine
base, and heroin base are moved South through Burma to southern
Thailand and Malaysia for conversion to heroin in laboratories
along the Thailand/Malaysia border. Refined heroin is also
trafficked from Burma to India, then to the West. </p>

<p>Heroin from Southeast Asia is most frequently brought to the
United States by couriers, typically Thai and U.S. nationals and
Hong Kong Chinese, traveling on commercial airlines. California
and Hawaii are the primary U.S. entry points for Golden Triangle
heroin, but small percentages of the drug are trafficked into New
York City and Washington D.C. While Southeast Asian groups have
had success in trafficking heroin to the United States, they
initially had difficulty arranging street level distribution.
However, with the incarceration of Asian traffickers in American
prisons during the 1970's, contacts between Asian and American
prisoners developed. These contacts have allowed Southeast Asian
traffickers access to individuals and organizations distributing
heroin at the retail level. </p>

<p>Chinese organized crime groups, known as Triads, located
primarily in Hong Kong, and their U.S. counterparts, Tongs, are
positioned to participate in Southeast Asian heroin traffic, but
the extent of their activity in these enterprises is not known at
the present time. These organizations provide Asians direct
access to criminal groups in the United States, and could
potentially assume a significant role in U.S. heroin trafficking
activities. Currently, there are major Triad organizations in New
York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, and Toronto. </p>

<p>Source Country Traffickers: Southwest Asia </p>

<p>Opium production in Southeast Asia was significantly reduced
in the late 1970's and early 1980's due to a prolonged drought.
This decrease, along with the unstable political climate in the
region caused by the fall of the ruling governments in South
Vietnam and Laos, resulted in a reduction of Southeast Asian
heroin exports to the United States. During this period, opium
production in the Golden Crescent area of Southwest Asia,
comprising the common border regions of Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Iran, markedly increased. In 1979 the Golden Crescent became the
primary U.S. heroin source. Southwest Asia continues to be this
country's major supplier: over one-half of the heroin entering
the United States in 1984 originated as opium in the Golden
Crescent. </p>

<p>The surge in Golden Crescent heroin exports to the United
States can be attributed to a number of factors. Opium has always
been grown in the region, but traditionally, opium grown in
Afghanistan and Pakistan was shipped directly to Iran to supply
that country's one million opium addicts. The situation changed
dramatically after the 1980 fundamentalist revolution in Iran, as
political and social instability allowed greatly increased
domestic opium production and curtailed the demand for opium from
Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Iranian market was further closed
to outsiders by the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which
blocked several of the traditional smuggling routes into Iran. </p>

<p>Concurrent with the reduction in Iranian demand for
non-domestic opium, growers in Afghanistan and Pakistan harvested
record crops. The opium crop in Pakistan alone increased by 400
percent between 1974-1979, from 200 to 800 metric tons.
Consequently Pakistani and Afghan traffickers learned to refine
their opium into heroin, and sought new markets for their
product, mainly in Western Europe and the and the United States. </p>

<p>Southwest Asian opium is grown in remote mountain areas and
generally is transported to crude laboratories in the
Pakistan/Afghanistan border areas. Most of the refineries are
located in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province or
Afghanistan's Nangarhai Province; many are clustered in the area
of the Khyber Pass. Refined heroin leaves Pakistan via several
routes: through Baluchistan to Iran and beyond; by sea through
Karachi to Bombay and on to the Arabian Gulf States or Europe;
overland through the Lahore area enroute to transit points in
India; or by air through Islamabad or Karachi. </p>

<p>Southwest Asian heroin is typically smuggled into the United
States concealed in legitimate shipments of air and sea cargo,
such as textiles or sports equipment manufactured by Pakistani
companies, or it is carried by air couriers. Couriers generally
travel on commercial carriers, and many have connections with
airline crews and station managers. The international postal
system is also commonly used to ship heroin from Pakistan
directly to the United States in sealed newspapers and
periodicals. </p>

<p>Golden Crescent heroin is trafficked into the United States by
a variety of narcotics organizations. The following is an
overview of some of the more significant groups involved in the
Southwest Asian heroin trade. </p>

<p>Pakistani Traffickers </p>

<p>Pakistani nationals are responsible for trafficking a
significant percentage of Golden Crescent heroin in the United
States, especially in the Northeast. The Pakistanis do not have a
sophisticated retail sales network in the United States and
typically rely on family or Pakistani friends in this country to
distribute drugs. They also have relied on black trafficking
organizations in Los Angeles, Detroit and New York, and with
Italian organized crime in New York City. One Pakistani
distribution system was described in testimony before this
Commission by a Pakistani national who was incarcerated for his
involvement in a distribution network. The Commission witness has
relatives living both in Lahore, Pakistan, and in the United
States; he was a resident of Houston, Texas and was employed as
an engineer while involved in heroin trafficking. In the heroin
operation, a family member in Lahore sent couriers to JFK airport
in New York with heroin concealed in false-bottom luggage. From
JFK, the couriers traveled &quot;in transit&quot; to La Guardia,
then on to Toronto. Because of their &quot;in transit&quot;
status, Customs Service officials did not search the travelers in
the United States, and Canadian Customs inspection was not
difficult to clear. </p>

<p>In Canada, traffickers often held a particular heroin shipment
for three to six months, until appropriate distribution contacts
were established and it was certain that law enforcement
officials were not aware of the shipment. At that time,
distribution contacts traveled by automobile to Toronto, picked
up a portion or all of the heroin shipment, and drove the heroin
into the United States without Customs interdiction. This
particular network supplied heroin to Seattle, Houston, San
Francisco, New York and Las Vegas. The contacts were all related
by blood or marriage. </p>

<p>Pakistanis also rely on the international postal system to
move drugs from Southwest Asia to the United States. In July
1983, for example, U.S. Customs officials at JFK Airport seized
one kilogram of heroin concealed in rolled newspapers destined
for Pakistani nationals residing in New York. The package had
been sent from the United Arab Emirates. Two other packages, each
containing one-half kilogram of heroin, were mailed to Berkeley,
California from the same source. Rolled newspapers and magazines
can conceal up to one kilogram of heroin and are generally sealed
in plastic. Drugs are also sent through the mail concealed in
shipments of textiles, clothing and other durable goods. </p>

<p>Lebanese Traffickers </p>

<p>A portion of Golden Crescent heroin passes through Lebanon en
route to the United States, thus affording Lebanese nationals an
opportunity to become involved in the trafficking activity. A
significant percentage of the heroin exported from Lebanon leaves
via Damascus International Airport. </p>

<p>In the United States, trafficking by Lebanese nationals is
especially prevalent in the Northeast. In one network,
non-Lebanese couriers primarily from Canada traveled to Damascus
and Beirut to pick up heroin which they then transported to
Houston, Detroit and New York via commercial carrier. Heroin was
concealed in false-bottom luggage and inside photo albums. The
heroin was transferred to Lebanese nationals living in Toronto
and Ontario, Canada, and in various cities in the United States.
Some of the money generated from the sale of this heroin was
laundered in banks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>India </p>

<p>A proportion of the heroin traditionally distributed abroad
through the Pakistan cities of Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta is
now being shipped through Bombay and New Dehli. Traffickers
smuggle Southwest Asian heroin into India along the Indo-Pakistan
border and transport it overland to the Indian cities; Southeast
Asian heroin is brought into Bombay and Calcutta by sea and
overland routes. Bombay, Calcutta and New Dehli are now major
staging, shipping and trafficking centers for heroin smuggled to
the West. Trafficking activity is frequent at Perlane Airport in
Dehli and at Bombay's Sahar International Airport, and Indian
harbors and airports are used by Pakistani, Afghan and Indian
traffickers as points of embarkation to Western destinations. </p>

<p>West Africa. </p>

<p>In the past three years, West African countries, especially
Nigeria, have been documented as transshipments centers for
Golden Crescent heroin. Nigerian couriers based in Lagos travel
to Pakistan to obtain heroin, then continue on commercial flights
to their final destinations, or return to Nigeria to repackage
the narcotics into smaller amounts for smuggling to the West. </p>

<p>A number of loosely associated Nigerian heroin trafficking
organizations have connections both with suppliers in Pakistan
and with retailers in Western Europe and the United States.
Typically, Nigerian couriers travel directly to Karachi on
commercial aircraft and purchase heroin in that city, but some
couriers continue to Peshawar to make their purchases. Couriers
return to Nigeria transiting other countries in Africa and
Europe. A different group of couriers, usually students or poor
residents of Lagos, traffic the drugs to Europe or the United
States. </p>

<p>Couriers typically enter the United States directly through
JFK airport in New York although in some cases, they come to this
country via cities in Europe and Canada. Drugs are concealed in
body cavities, and in false-bottom suitcases. </p>

<p>After the heroin arrives in the United States, it is sold only
to one or two American distributors in a given area. Distribution
networks are most active in New York City and Washington, D.C.
and are operative in Los Angeles, Houston and Boston. DEA reports
that individuals in nearly every community of Nigerian nationals
in the United States has some link to heroin traffickers and
couriers. Profits from heroin sales are laundered through banks
in the United States in Britain. </p>

<p>The Post-French Connection LCN </p>

<p>Traditional organized crime continues to play a significant
role in this country's heroin trade through the 1980's. The LCN's
long established connections with criminal organizations in
Sicily facilitate the movement of heroin from Europe to the
United States, and while Sicily is no longer a major refinery for
heroin, the country is a major transshipment center for Southwest
and Southeast Asian heroin. Sicilian organizations supply LCN
affiliates with heroin; LCN networks either distribute the drug
themselves or sell it in large quantities to major distributors. </p>

<p>The LCN As A Supplier: The Nicky Barnes Operation </p>

<p>Black criminal groups have controlled some percentage of
heroin traffic in New York City since the 1940's. Their influence
increased significantly in the early 1970's, after the French
Connection. The first major independent black trafficking
organization, a group of over one hundred distributors and
couriers, was headed by Charles Green. The Green organization
imported heroin and cocaine from South America and distributed
the drugs throughout New York City during the late 1960's. Green
was arrested in 1970, control of this heroin network passed to
Frank Matthews. Matthews was brought in to the heroin business by
Louis Cirillo, a major LCN associate, and was continually
supplied with LCN heroin. </p>

<p>Leroy &quot;Nicky&quot; Barnes succeeded Matthews in 1971.
Under his leadership, the organization controlled heroin sales
and manufacture throughout New York State into Canada and
Pennsylvania. The Barnes operation was well-organized and
lucrative. By 1976, Barnes had at least seven major lieutenants
under his direction; each of them controlled a dozen mid-level
distributors, who in turn supplied up to forty street-level
retailers. Barnes at all times remained well insulated from the
daily trafficking activities, and maintained a wealthy lifestyle.
He owned five homes, a Mercedes, a Maserati, several Lincolns,
Cadillacs and Thunderbirds, and hundreds of suits and coats. He
estimates that his total trafficking income was at least several
million dollars. </p>

<p>Barnes joined with six other major New York dealers to form a
heroin cartel called the &quot;Council&quot; in the mid 1970's.
Members of the Council pooled funds to purchase multi-kilo
amounts of heroin, worked to ensure a consistent supply of the
drug in their distribution area, combined their
&quot;cutting&quot; and distribution networks in certain cases,
and often used a common sources for diluents, weapons,
automobiles and other resources. The Council had specific
&quot;departments&quot; which arranged legal services, security
and enforcement, and financial services including money
laundering. </p>

<p>Barnes' most significant source of heroin, to whom he directed
other Council members, was LCN associate &quot;Natty&quot;
Madonna. Despite Barnes' assertion and belief that the Council
worked completely independently of the Mafia, through the Madonna
connection, LCN heroin was prevalent in Harlem traffic from 1972
to 1976. </p>

<p>The Asian-LCN Links </p>

<p>La Cosa Nostra actively seeks out Asian nationals as
connections to heroin sources in Southeast Asia. In testimony
before the President's Commission on organized crime, Franklin
Liu, a veteran Hong Kong clothier, explained how he was recruited
as a courier for a New York La Cosa Nostra family involved in
heroin trafficking. Liu, who held a legitimate four year business
visa which allowed him to travel without restriction, was first
contacted by Antonio Turano, a reputed member of the Sicilian
Mafia, in connection with Turano's money laundering operations.
In one instance, Turano brought Liu a suitcase filled with
$400,000 cash, and requested that Liu wire the money to a bank in
Zurich. Turano met with Liu in Milan in the course of the
operation to make certain that the money had been wired without
incident. </p>

<p>At a later date, after Liu had successfully participated in a
number of money laundering operations, Turano asked Liu if he had
any connections to drug traffickers in the Far East; Liu did not.
Turano arranged a connection, and agreed to pay Liu $5,000 for
every kilo of heroin he trafficked into the United States. Liu
was subsequently contacted by Turano's agent, a Thai woman, and
arranged to meet her at a hotel in New York City. When they met,
each held half of a one dollar bill given to them by Turano as
identification. Liu gave the woman his car keys; the next day she
returned the car with heroin in the trunk and requested a payment
of $40,000 in cash and a $60,000 bank check. When Liu went to
collect the money from Turano, he found that Turano had been
arrested. Liu was subsequently arrested and convicted on charges
of conspiracy to import heroin in connection with this case. </p>

<p>The Pizza Connection </p>

<p>During the late 1970's and early 1980's members of La Cosa
Nostra in the United States allegedly cooperated with the
Sicilian Mafia in a drug trafficking conspiracy which resulted in
the importation of heroin worth over $1.6 billion into the United
States. In April, 1984, 38 individuals were indicted on charges
related to the trafficking operation, popularly known as the
&quot;Pizza Connection.&quot; The network that developed to
facilitate the traffic in this enterprise was reputedly one of
the largest heroin importation operations in history, and used
pizza parlors throughout this country to distribute heroin
smuggled from Southeast and Southwest Asia via Sicily to the
United States. Additional heroin that was trafficked through this
system was produced in laboratories operating in Sicily. </p>

<p>According to the indictment in the case, the &quot;Pizza
Connection&quot; heroin network relied upon a faction of the New
York Bonanno organized crime family headed by Salvatore Catalano
to distribute the heroin in this country. In turn, the heroin
business of this Bonanno crime faction was tied directly to
organized criminal groups in Sicily, the rest of Italy,
Switzerland, Spain, and Brazil. Direct evidence of the existence
of the network was first obtained in 1980 when couriers were
observed transferring enormous amounts of cash through investment
houses and banks in New York city to Italy and Switzerland. Tens
of millions of dollars derived from heroin sales in this country
were transferred overseas in this fashion, apparently in
violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. </p>

<p>Investigations related to the &quot;Pizza Connection&quot;
case have revealed that factions of the Sicilian Mafia operate in
the United States independently of the American La Cosa Nostra.
While the two groups apparently cooperate on certain ventures
such as the &quot;Pizza Connection&quot; heroin importation
operations, they appear to be distinct and separate organizations
under different leadership. </p>

<h2>Chapter III Part 2: Marijuana Trafficking </h2>

<p>Marijuana trafficking presents both unique opportunities and
significant disadvantages for the smugglers who provide the drug
to American consumers. The volume of demand for marijuana
precludes domination of the market by any group of traffickers
and allows a constant influx of small-scale and mid-size
operators as limited suppliers. These smaller groups are in large
part able to enter the market because of marijuana's
comparatively low wholesale cost. While an investment of tens of
thousands of dollars is required for entry into the U.S. heroin
or cocaine traffic, a capital investment of less than $10,000 is
generally sufficient in the marijuana trade. Finally, although
marijuana is supplied to U.S. consumers by growers in Colombia,
Mexico and Jamaica, nearly one-sixth of the U.S. supply is
domestically grown. Because significant amounts of the drug are
cultivated in all 50 States, American traffickers need not travel
to a foreign source country for a marijuana supply. </p>

<p>While the barriers to entry in the U.S. marijuana traffic are
relatively low, marijuana sales generate a small profit in
comparison to other illicit drugs. This is primarily because
marijuana, unlike heroin or cocaine, in not diluted or
&quot;cut&quot; in the intermediate phases of trafficking, but is
sold in much the same form at the wholesale and retail levels.
Marijuana is bulky and difficult to transport in high-profit
quantity: the profit generated from the retail sale of 700 pounds
of commercial Colombian marijuana could most probably be equalled
from the retail sale of one kilogram of diluted cocaine. Finally,
trafficking marijuana implies increased risks of interdiction
because the bulk of the drug makes it most visible to law
enforcement authorities. </p>

<p>Despite the relative ease with which small-scale traffickers
can enter the marijuana market, only large criminal organizations
have the resources and connections necessary to generate large
profits from marijuana trafficking. Many of these groups deal in
other drugs in addition to marijuana, and are organized to
facilitate the movement of any drug to the United States with
minimal interference from law enforcement authorities. Their size
allows group control of all aspects of a trafficking venture from
cultivation through the wholesale transaction, thus eliminating
middlemen, decreasing costs and maximizing profit. Unlike smaller
operations, the major trafficking groups have the capital
required to purchase the large vessels, trucks, or planes
necessary for smuggling high profit multi-ton quantities of
marijuana. A final advantage is their willingness to use violence
and corruption, the tools traditionally associated with organized
crime, to ensure the success of smuggling ventures. </p>

<p>Historical Context </p>

<p>From the 1930's through the mid-1970's, Mexican growers and
traffickers supplied nearly all of the marijuana consumed in the
United States. Most shipments of the drug were smuggled into this
country by car or truck; a small percentage was transported by
air. The Mexican monopoly ended in 1975, when in a joint venture,
U.S. and Mexican authorities increased marijuana interdiction and
eradication efforts in major Mexican cultivation regions and
along the U.S. borders. Paraquat, a potent herbicide toxic to
humans, was used widely in the eradication program, and
contaminated much of the Mexican crop. Despite the interdiction
efforts, a portion of the tainted marijuana was successfully
smuggled into the United States, and many Americans who smoked
the drug subsequently suffered adverse health consequences.
Eradication and interdiction of the Mexican crop, compounded by
the American marijuana smokers' reluctance to purchase a
potentially paraquat-tainted drug, resulted in a simultaneous
decrease in the availability of and the demand for Mexican
marijuana. By 1979 Mexico supplied only an estimated 11 percent
of the marijuana available in the United States and by 1981 that
figure dropped to 4 percent. </p>

<p>Concurrent with the commitment of more manpower and resources
to marijuana eradication and interdiction efforts in Mexico,
authorities in Jamaica, which was the source of the 10 percent of
the American supply not originating in Mexico, mounted a similar
campaign. The Jamaican initiatives significantly reduced
marijuana production and trafficking in that country, and
virtually eliminated Jamaica from the American marijuana trade
for a number of years. </p>

<p>During the mid-1970's America's two marijuana supply sources,
traffickers in Mexico and Jamaica, had only small amounts of the
drug available for export. The resulting vacuum was swiftly
filled by Colombian criminal groups, who for years had been
involved in smuggling all manner of contraband. Through the late
1960's these groups increased cultivation of marijuana in remote
regions of the Guajira Peninsula and began to develop systems to
facilitate the transport of multi-ton quantities of the drug to
the United States. At the same time, many Colombian groups were
establishing themselves as major operators in the cocaine trade:
the organizational structures, trafficking routes and corrupted
officials necessary for cocaine ventures often proved equally
useful for marijuana trafficking. </p>

<p>Once the Colombians established a position as marijuana
traffickers, their role in the traffic expanded rapidly. By 1975
airstrips capable of handling heavy 4-engine planes with the
capacity to hold one ton of marijuana were common along the
Guajira Peninsula. Loading facilities for
&quot;motherships,&quot; large vessels capable of transporting
tons of marijuana, dotted the coast. By the early 1980's a
Congressional committee estimated that between 15 and 60 thousand
tons of marijuana were exported from that country to the United
States each year. </p>

<p>In 1985 Colombia remains the major supplier of U.S. marijuana,
but the Colombian share of the market has declined significantly
since 1980. This decrease is attributed to increased eradication
in Colombia and to accelerated interdiction along major
trafficking routes. Colombia's reduced production has been offset
by increased cultivation and trafficking both in Mexico and
Jamaica. Mexico, now ranked second in world marijuana production,
could become the leading producer in 1986, given a Mexican bumper
harvest and continuing eradication in Colombia. </p>

<p>This short history of marijuana trafficking demonstrates that
law enforcement pressure in a particular cultivation area is
compensated by production and trafficking increases elsewhere.
Trafficking organizations are positioned in all major source
countries to handle increased volume when opportunities present. </p>

<p>Trafficking Today: Colombia </p>

<p>Colombia supplied 42 percent of the marijuana consumed in the
United States in 1984. The major percentage of this traffic was
controlled by large Colombian criminal organizations. </p>

<p>Although the Colombian marijuana crop is cultivated in several
regions of the country, the largest production occurs along the
Guijara Peninsula. Colombian traffickers purchase marijuana from
growers, and sometimes provide protection and additional
financing for cultivation. Crops are harvested twice each year,
with the largest harvest occurring in the fall. The harvest
pattern directly affects the level of marijuana trafficking
activity between Colombia and the United States; trafficking is
naturally heaviest after the fall harvest. </p>

<p>Nearly 90 percent of the marijuana exported from Colombia is
shipped to the United States by sea; almost all the remainder is
transported on general aviation aircraft. Both maritime and air
traffic are primarily concentrated along Colombia's north coast,
although some percentage of the traffic is centered along the
country's Pacific coast. </p>

<p>The major portion of Colombian marijuana is shipped to the
United States on large motherships. These ships are typically
fishing vessels or freighters and can hold tons of marijuana; a
100-foot mothership can transport SO tons and a 400 foot
mothership can ship over 100 tons of the drug. These ships,
generally owned or at least controlled by Colombian trafficking
organizations, remain at sea or in selected Colombian ports until
a shipment is prepared for export and transported to a beach site
along the Colombian coast. There are more than 100 such sites
along the north coast from Barranquilla to Portete, all which are
linked by a network of roads, trails and airstrips to the major
growing areas. When preparations are complete on shore, the
mothership moves into a prearranged loading point typically
one-half to 3 miles offshore. Small boats then ferry bales of
marijuana from shore to the mothership; loading of many tons may
be accomplished within an hour. Motherships are nearly always
loaded at night to decrease risks of detection. </p>

<p>The loaded motherships generally either sail from the Guajira
coast directly to the southeastern United States or to Caribbean
transshipment points, where cargo is off-loaded for future
pickup. Traffickers use the same maritime routes popular with
cocaine traffickers; the Windward Passage between Cuba and Haiti,
the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba, and the Mona
Passage, bordered by the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, are
most frequently traveled. From these routes American ports along
the Gulf of Mexico and the east coast are accessible to
smugglers. In addition, a small percentage of Colombian ships now
sail directly to the U.S. west coast. </p>

<p>Those motherships that approach the U.S. coast typically hover
50-100 miles offshore in international waters. There, they are
met by small ships, typically purchased or rented shrimp boats,
which off-load and ferry the drug shipment to shore. While
traffickers traditionally made no attempt to conceal bales of
marijuana, either on motherships or on off-loading vessels,
increased law enforcement surveillance has recently prompted
smugglers to hide their drugs in secret compartments or in empty
or false fuel tanks. </p>

<p>The Colombian trafficking organization normally oversees the
cultivation and export of marijuana only through the off-loading
procedure. Off-loading is accomplished by &quot;service
providers&quot; who never actually own the marijuana, but who
merely collect a fee for its safe transfer. Once on the U.S.
shore, the drug shipment is delivered to a distributor, who in
turn supplies lower level dealers. The traffic below the
wholesale distributor level is vast and not well-understood. </p>

<p>Motherships that do not travel to the United States generally
transit the Bahamas and/or the Caribbean. In both regions
marijuana traffickers can either transfer shipments from
motherships to smaller crafts, which sail to the United States,
or they can unload and store shipments at island storage bases.
Use of island transshipment points has increased as law
enforcement efforts have intensified along the southeastern U.S.
coast. Rampant official corruption in a number of island nations
facilitates this traffic. </p>

<p>An estimated 3 percent of the marijuana shipped from Colombia
to the United States by sea is transported on commercial vessels.
Typically, marijuana is concealed in containerized cargo, but in
some instances crewmen or cruise ship passengers have been
directly implicated in trafficking the drug. In terms of
quantity, cargo shipment provides great opportunities for
traffickers and presents a decreased risk of interdiction. </p>

<p>Air Shipment </p>

<p>An estimated 10 percent of the marijuana smuggled from
Colombia to the United States reaches this country via general
aviation aircraft or commercial air shipment. Non-commercial air
shipment of marijuana parallels the Colombian air trafficking
patterns common in cocaine smuggling. Many of the same air routes
and transshipment points are used; the same airstrips are
accessible along the north coast of the country, and the same
methods used to avoid law enforcement interference are
applicable. Smugglers use both smaller twin engine aircraft and
larger four-engine planes for marijuana transport. When air
transport allows faster shipment, it limits export quantities and
increases the likelihood of interdiction. </p>

<p>A small portion of the marijuana exported from Colombia is
shipped by aircraft, then air-dropped over sea or land for pickup
and further shipment to the United States. Most airdrop activity
occurs in the Bahamas, but an increasing number of drops have
been intercepted in the Yucatan Peninsula, Jamaica, Haiti, the
Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Medium-size to large twin
engine aircraft are typically used for air-drop operations. </p>

<p>In addition to trafficking marijuana to the United States or
transshipment points, Colombian organizations sell marijuana
directly to non-Colombian traffickers, who assume responsibility
for the shipment in Colombia. The buyers then traffic the drug
into the United States using maritime and air shipment systems
similar to the Colombian methods. </p>

<p>Mexico </p>

<p>Mexican marijuana production nearly doubled from 1983 to 1984,
positioning Mexico as the second leading supplier of the drug to
the United States. An estimated 20 percent of the marijuana
available for consumption in the United States originates in or
transits Mexico, and that figure is expected to increase with a
bumper harvest in 1985. PEA analysts predict that this increased
production, with concomitant eradication and interdiction
successes in Colombia, could make Mexico the top American
marijuana source in 1985. </p>

<p>Although marijuana is grown in nearly every state in Mexico,
heaviest cultivation occurs in the northern and western states of
Sonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Oaxaca and Cuerra. As in Colombia,
crops are harvested twice each year, with the largest harvest in
the fall. Cultivation occurs both in small open fields and in
well-maintained, hundred-acre sites. Growers are typically
overseen and financed by larger trafficking organizations. </p>

<p>Harvested marijuana is prepared for shipment near the
cultivation fields. Mexican marijuana is transported to the
United States by primarily overland methods, although aircraft
are also used to smuggle drugs across the border. Overland
shipments are typically concealed in automobile trucks, false
truck beds, camper tops and tanker trunks. The larger trucks
commonly haul multi-ton quantities: U.S. officials at El Paso,
Texas, seized nearly 6.5 tons of marijuana from a tanker truck in
February 1984, and nearly 30 tons from a cargo truck in March of
that year. In addition, suitcases of marijuana are often
forwarded on commercial bus lines to destinations beyond border
checkpoints for subsequent pick-up. </p>

<p>Air shipments generally run between private Mexican airstrips
and clandestine runways or drop spots in the southwestern United
States. Single engine aircraft are popular with Mexican smugglers
because they can land on open fields, roadways and rough landing
strips common on both sides of the border, and typically carry
about 1,500 pounds of marijuana. While few details are available
concerning marijuana air shipment, the great assortment of
airstrips on both sides of the border suggests a significant
volume of air traffic. A 1977 survey, for example, detected
nearly 3,000 airstrips in Mexico; one-half of them were
concentrated in ten major clusters. About 600 strips lie along
the United States border and are ideally positioned to serve
either as launching sites for flights into the United States or
as refueling stops for flights en route to this country from
southern Mexico. Strips in the other clusters most likely serve
as refueling and transshipment points for aircraft traveling
between South America and the United States. A large number of
airstrips in the southeastern United States serve as landing
sites for the Mexican flights. </p>

<p>Larger Mexican criminal organizations appear to control a
significant portion of the marijuana traffic between Mexico and
the United States. Many groups are active in both cocaine and
heroin smuggling as well as marijuana trafficking. The central
organizations are generally controlled by members of one extended
family, but often include non-family members in lower positions.
Like other trafficking groups, the Mexicans rely consistently on
an essential criminal support of attorneys, bankers and other
professionals, both in Mexico and in the United States. </p>

<p>Prominent among the larger Mexican organizations are the
groups headed by Jamie Herrera Navarres, Rafael Caro Quintero,
Ernesto Fonesca and Miguel Felix Gallardo. These groups
collaborate in smuggling ventures, much as the major Colombian
cocaine trafficking organizations work in concert to maximize
resources and profits. In one recent instance, for example, a
consortium of traffickers led by Caro Quintero cultivated
hundreds of hectares of marijuana at five separate large-scale
sites throughout the state of Chihuahua. All fields were
landscaped, fertilized and well-irrigated, demonstrating the
Mexican traffickers' knowledge of high-tech agricultural
techniques. The cultivation sites, along with eight associated
processing camps, were seized by Mexican authorities in November
1984. The seizures netted 10,000 metric tons of whole marijuana,
or an estimated 1,900 to 2,400 tons of net marketable marijuana.
In this single operation, officials confiscated 8 times more
marijuana than Mexican and American authorities at the time
believed was produced annually throughout Mexico. The seizure
raised serious questions both about the magnitude of drug traffic
between Mexico and the United States and about continuing
official corruption throughout Mexico. It seems highly unlikely
that an operation the size of the Chihuahua system could develop
or function without earlier detection by authorities. </p>

<p>Jamaica </p>

<p>Jamaica, from 1980 to 1984 this country's second leading
marijuana supplier, provided 14 percent of the United States
market share in 1984, trailing Colombia's 42 percent and Mexico's
20 percent contributions. Jamaican traffickers, much less highly
organized than their counterparts in Colombia and Mexico,
supplied about 1800 metric tons of marijuana, as well as smaller
amounts of sinsemilla and hashish oil to United States consumers
in 1984. </p>

<p>The greatest portion of Jamaican marijuana is transported to
the United States by general aviation aircraft, although some
maritime shipment also occurs. Over 70 island airstrips, one-half
of which are clandestine, facilitate the air traffic, which
commonly includes shipment by single engine and light to heavy
twin engine aircraft. Jamaican marijuana shipments are typically
either flown directly to United States landing sites or are
air-dropped to small pleasure craft in waters near the Bahamas. </p>

<p>Multi-ton marijuana shipments are occasionally transported to
the United States on small motherships, pleasure craft and cruise
ships. A small percentage of Jamaican marijuana exported to the
United States is concealed in containerized cargo on commercial
maritime vessels. </p>

<p>The United States Crop </p>

<p>The United States is currently a significant marijuana source
country: about 12 percent of the marijuana consumed in the United
States in 1984 was domestically cultivated. The largest crops are
grown in Hawaii, California, and Oklahoma, but there is now some
production in every State. Growers can be landowners, but are
typically squatters who operate independently or in small groups.
They cultivate their crops in Federal fields, forested land,
private clandestine plots or greenhouses, scattering plants next
to trees or amid legitimate crops to avoid detection. Planting on
Federal land offers growers the advantage of anonymity and
shields them from recently enacted laws which authorize seizure
of their property or other assets. Many plots, including those on
Federal parkland are wired with devices, such as punji sticks,
fish hooks hung at eye level, and trip wires attached to guns and
boulders, designed to ensure the security of the crop. Growers
are often armed and violent. </p>

<p>There is presently no evidence of a highly developed
distribution system for the domestic marijuana crop in the United
States. It appears that numerous smaller organizations traffic
the drug between states and that some individual growers supply
larger criminal organizations in major cities nationwide. These
organizations, which include both La Cosa Nostra groups and
trafficking specific groups, distribute domestic and imported
marijuana to brokers, retailers, and street-level dealers. The
extent of their control of the U.S. market is uncertain but
estimated to be significant. </p>

<p>The Role of the LCN </p>

<p>In 1967 Federal officials reported that the LCN was not
significantly involved In trafficking marijuana. Low profit was
thought to be the primary disincentive to La Cosa Nostra
involvement; in addition, the large and loosely structured market
was thought to be unattractive and uncontrollable. In the late
1960's the United States marijuana supply was exported almost
exclusively from Mexico. Entry into the trafficking business
required little capital and a simple border crossing, and thus
attracted many small and independent operators. When Colombia
became the major United States marijuana supplier in the early
1970's, however, the LCN was provided with a more controllable
source. Concurrent with this production shift, the United States
demand for marijuana and the retail price level for the drug
steadily escalated, prompting some LCN families to become
involved in trafficking marijuana. For a short period, this
activity proved to be a high profit/low risk enterprise for
traditional organized crime. Additionally, trafficking marijuana
carried little of the social stigma associated with trafficking
heroin or cocaine. </p>

<p>As the following case study demonstrates, marijuana
trafficking has increased the vulnerability of some organized
crime families and has led to a number of significant LCN
arrests. </p>

<p>Case Study: The Cleveland Connection </p>

<p>In the mid-1970's, Carmen Zagaria, a Cleveland drug dealer,
began to buy wholesale marijuana by the pound and sell it at
retail in one ounce bags. He rapidly expanded his business in the
course of a few years and developed a network of suppliers,
couriers and distributors. Although the business prospered
generally, Zagaria lost a substantial investment in one foiled
drug transaction in 1979 and borrowed money from Angelo Lonardo,
the reputed underboss of the Cleveland LCN Licavoli family. In
return for the loan, the Licavoli family assumed control of the
Zagaria operation. </p>

<p>Under Lonardo's oversight, the Zagaria enterprise expanded
rapidly. By 1980 the organization was buying 400-800 pounds of
marijuana per week and had incorporated over 20 couriers. PCP,
LSD, cocaine and hashish were added to the traffic. </p>

<p>The methods used by Zagaria were simple. His couriers flew to
the southeastern United States, usually to Florida via commercial
airline, and established contact there with a Zagaria supplier.
Suppliers included both LCN affiliates and non-LCN dealers.
Couriers picked up large marijuana shipments, paid for them in
cash, and drove the drugs back to Cleveland in rental cars. In
Cleveland the shipments were stored in stash houses, then
distributed to a network of wholesalers and retailers. The
Zagaria enterprise was a high-volume multimillion dollar
operation; in a single 10-day period in 1980 the group brought
3,000 pounds of marijuana to Cleveland from Atlanta. </p>

<p>In the course of his trafficking business Zagaria was involved
in numerous crimes, including murder. In 1982 he was convicted of
selling seven pounds of marijuana and 21 grams of cocaine and was
sentenced to 10-30 years in prison. Zagaria became a Federal
informant and though never a member of the Licavoli family
himself, provided sufficient testimony about family activities to
bring the leadership before a grand jury. In 1983 Angelo Lonardo
and five other Licavoli associates were convicted and
incarcerated without possibility of parole for numerous crimes,
including conspiracy to distribute marijuana. </p>

<p>Other Drugs </p>

<p>Millions of Americans abuse a number of licit and illicit
drugs other than heroin, cocaine and marijuana; these include
stimulants, synthetic narcotics, hallucinogens, and depressants.
Most popular among these dangerous drugs are diazepam (Valium),
methamphetamine and PCP. In addition, controlled substance
analogs known commonly as &quot;designer drugs,&quot; have gained
popularity with users since 1980. </p>

<p>Dangerous drugs are available to the consumer from three major
sources. Many of the drugs are approved for medical use in the
United States, and reach the illicit market through a variety of
diversion methods. A significant portion of the United States
supply of certain drugs, notably amphetamines and diazepam, is
diverted from licit channels in foreign countries and smuggled
into the United States. Finally, it is estimated that all the PCP
and chemical analogs, nearly all the methamphetamine and about 80
percent of the injectable amphetamine available on the illicit
market in 1984 were produced in clandestine United States
laboratories. </p>

<p>Only certain areas of the traffic in dangerous drugs clearly
reflect organized crime involvement. Most notably, the traffic
appears to be dominated nationwide by outlaw motorcycle gangs.
According to the Commission's survey of local law enforcement
officials, these gangs control nearly 40 percent of the
&quot;dangerous drug&quot; traffic in the United States. While
these gangs have traditionally been active in trafficking a wide
variety of illicit drugs, they have developed the technology to
manufacture methamphetamine and PCP, and have been a major force
in the wholesale and resale distribution of these two drugs
nationwide. </p>

<p>The major outlaw motorcycle gangs traffic dangerous drugs
within separate territorial boundaries: the Hell's Angels control
the West Coast trade, the Outlaws dominate the Midwest and parts
of the east coast, the Bandidos control the Southwest, and
Eastern Seaboard States are dominated by the Pagans. Officials
are uncertain of the total membership of the four groups, but
estimate that nearly all the U.S. traffic in PCP, and up to
three-fourths of the illicit methamphetamine traffic falls under
their control. </p>

<p>The Hell's Angels, the oldest of the four groups, first became
involved in drug distribution in the late 1960's. Initially, the
group trafficked marijuana, heroin, cocaine, seconal, PCP,
amphetamines and methamphetamines. In the early 1970's the
organization recruited a chemist to manufacture methamphetamine
and to instruct other organization members in the procedure.
Hell's Angels' activity shifted as their production of
methamphetamine increased and within a short period of time, the
organization dominated west coast methamphetamine manufacture and
distribution. </p>

<p>In the eastern United States, the Pagan's gang leadership also
recruited chemists and gained control of the methamphetamine and
PCP markets from Florida to New England. Pagan drug activity is
centered in the Philadelphia/ South New Jersey area; several
Pagan-controlled processing centers and small laboratories are
located in the region. It is known by law enforcement officials
that Pagan gang members have frequently cooperated in joint
ventures with the Philadelphia Bruno organized crime family,
especially in methamphetamine and PCP manufacture and
distribution. Officials believe that the Bruno leadership
regularly finances a portion of Pagan drug activities in return
for a percentage of the drug profits and enforcement and
protection services. In addition, it appears that the Pagans and
the Bruno family have arranged to divide control of the
methamphetamine and PCP markets in certain territories and that
the two groups coexist and cooperate in these regions. </p>

<p>Case Study: The Pagan/Bruno Relationship. </p>

<p>Between 1977 and 1981 both the Pagan motorcycle gang and the
Bruno organized crime family were active and competitive
distributors of methamphetamine throughout the mid-Atlantic
states. Both groups obtained P2P, an essential chemical in
methamphetamine production, from Ronald Raiton, the major
supplier of the chemical in the eastern United States. Raiton
supplied P2P directly to Ronald Kownacki, a businessman closely
aligned with the Pagan leadership, and to Ronald Martorano, a
Bruno family associate. Though Kownacki and Martorano both
operated in the Philadelphia area, their laboratories and
clientele were distinct. </p>

<p>Kownacki paid the Bruno family a $10,000 fee for every gallon
of P2P he purchased from Raiton. He sold the methamphetamine he
produced to Pagan Walter &quot;Buckets&quot; Jozwiak, who cut the
drug and distributed it to Pagan mother club members in New
Jersey, Delaware and Philadelphia. Martorano distributed his
methamphetamine through Bruno family channels. </p>

<p>In 1980 Kownacki was assaulted and robbed by two Bruno
associates, who claimed they were collecting a debt owed to the
Bruno family. They stole a significant amount of gold from
Kownacki, which he maintained belonged to the Pagans. In February
1981 a number of Pagans confronted members of the Bruno family
and demanded that the gold be returned. The Bruno associates
refused, but agreed to meet with the Pagans to negotiated
possible joint ventures in trafficking methamphetamine and PCP.
Finally in 1982 the Pagans and the Bruno family agreed that each
group would control methamphetamine and PCP markets in separate
territories and that competition between them in these areas
would cease. In 1983 after the agreement, the estimated street
value of the Pagan PCP and methamphetamine operations was $15.5
million. </p>

<p>Organized crime involvement in trafficking dangerous drugs
other than methamphetamine and PCP in the United States is not
well-documented. La Cosa Nostra appears to be active in
trafficking methaqualone from Colombia through Florida to major
United States cities, but the scope of their interest in this
market is not known. Mexican traffickers have smuggled
significant quantities of diazepam, methaqualone and amphetamine
into this country for at least ten years. A major portion of the
illicit methaqualone traditionally available in this country was
trafficked to the United States by Colombian organized crime
groups; however, international controls adopted by virtually all
major producing and exporting countries have led to worldwide
shortage of the drug. </p>

<p>The DEA currently reports that organized crime is not now
involved in the production or distribution of controlled
substance analogs, &quot;designer drugs.&quot; Given the enormous
profit potential of these substances, however, and the relatively
simple manufacturing processes required in their production, the
formulation and distribution of controlled substance analogs
would seem to be an endeavor perfectly suited to organized crime.
</p>

<p>Drug Trafficking, Terrorism, and Insurgency </p>

<p>Drug trafficking organizations in many areas of the world
coexist and cooperate with political insurgent groups and
terrorists. Their typical relationship is mutually beneficial:
traffickers supply terrorists with American currency and weapons
in return for protection and assistance in smuggling activities.
While terrorists and insurgents do not currently control
significant portions of the drug trade, the profit potentially
realized from even isolated drug transactions could provide
sizable revenues for a militant cause. Terrorists and insurgents
funded through drug trafficking could very conceivably become
powerful enough to disrupt governments in a number of countries
presently allied with the United States, and thus pose a serious
threat to this country's national security. </p>

<p>The role of terrorists and insurgents in drug trafficking has
expanded greatly since the early 1970's as drug trafficking has
spread across the world. At that time, heroin traffic was
controlled by North American organized crime groups working with
Sicilian suppliers in the French Connection, marijuana was
supplied to the United States almost exclusively by Mexican
trafficking organizations, and cocaine traffic in this country
was insignificant. Heroin now reaches North America from Europe,
the Middle East, Mexico and Southeast Asia. Marijuana is
trafficked to the United States by Colombian and Caribbean based
groups as well as by Mexicans, and cocaine from nearly every
country in South America satisfies a still-increasing demand for
the drug throughout this country. </p>

<p>At the same time, the expanded United States market for
illicit drugs has swelled the profit from trafficking to enormous
proportions, and attracted terrorist and insurgent groups to this
activity. In addition, this source of funding serves the
ideological purposes of many groups. As explained by terrorism
expert Michael Ledeen: </p>

<p>Running drugs is one sure way to make big money in a hurry.
Moreover, the directions of the flow are ideologically
attractive. Drugs go to the bourgeois countries, where they
corrupt and where they kill, while the arms go to pro-Communist
terrorist groups in the Third World. </p>

<p>The links between terrorist and insurgent groups and
traffickers are most substantial in drug source countries,
including Colombia, Peru, Burma and Thailand. In Colombia, four
major insurgent organizations work in collaboration with cocaine
traffickers. The oldest, largest, and best-equipped of these
groups is the Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia (FARC), which
is the armed wing of the Colombian Communist Party (PCC) and
claims over 5,000 active members and supporters. The FARC forces
consist of between 23 and 28 &quot;fronts,&quot; essentially
independent company-level forces, nearly all of which are located
in Colombia's rural areas. Over one-half of the fronts operate in
coca and marijuana growing regions. FARC forces cultivate some
coca, but derive more profit by collecting protection payments
from coca growers in their operating territory, often demanding a
10 percent share of the drug profits. One FARC front reportedly
obtained over $3.8 million per month by assessing this protection
tax. Collected monies are used to buy weapons and supplies which
are often shipped into Colombia on return drug flights. Two FARC
fronts have had documented direct dealings with cocaine
traffickers to obtain arms and ammunition. </p>

<p>In exchange for the levied fee, the FARC forces protect
growing and trafficking areas, including air fields, and warn
traffickers of nearby anti-narcotics police or military patrols.
In certain areas of Colombia FARC fronts control enough strategic
points to make police travel difficult or impossible. </p>

<p>FARC encampments have recently been discovered in close
proximity to several major cocaine processing centers. For
example, on April 6, 1984, during a raid of a fully operational
processing center in Southeast Colombia known as &quot;La
Loma,&quot; officials discovered and subsequently destroyed a
FARC guerrilla base camp. The FARC camp, complete with airstrips
and large stockpiles of food and medical supplies, that group's
direct involvement in providing protection for the cocaine
traffickers. A month prior to the La Loma raid, when authorities
raided another processing center nearby known as Tranquilandia,
they were met by approximately 30 armed resistors in fatigue
uniforms believed to be FARC members. </p>

<p>A number of other militant organizations in Colombia have also
been associated with the drug trade. The leftist 19th of April
movement (M-19) has been most notable for its October 1985
takeover of the Colombian Palace of Justice in which 11 of that
country's Supreme Court Justices were murdered. Although M-19 was
once hostile to traffickers, and on several occasions kidnapped
relatives of prominent drug smugglers, some officials maintain
that the October incident was related to drug trafficking. It is
alleged that the attack was motivated by the M-19's desire to
destroy records that might lead to the extradition a number of
major Colombian cocaine traffickers, and to intimidate
authorities in Colombia to force them to rescind the extradition
treaty in effect between that country and the United States. M-19
also at least once traded drugs for arms from Cuba through
Colombian trafficker Jaime Guillot-Lara. In the early 1970's to
1982 Guillot supplied M-19 with weapons in return for their
assistance in his drug smuggling activities through high-ranking
Cuban officials. The Cubans provided a safe haven for Guillot's
drug smuggling vessels en route to the United States from
Colombia in return for payments. M-19 received periodic weapons
shipments for facilitating the arrangement on Guillot Lara's
return trips to Colombia from the United States. </p>

<p>In Peru, where an estimated 40 percent of the world coca crop
is grown, insurgents and traffickers share much the same
relationship evidenced by the Colombians. Insurgents and growers
work in the same remote areas, primarily in the upper Huallaga
Valley, but operate separately. Smugglers supply arms and money
are supplied in return for militant protection. The two groups do
not maintain a structured relationship or pursue common goals;
their collaboration is one of convenience. </p>

<p>The most prominent insurgent group currently operating in Peru
is the Maoist Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso), which seeks a
rural-based revolution to rid the predominantly peasant
population of the &quot;imperialistic&quot; influences of the
United States and other foreign governments. While existing
evidence is insufficient to link the Shining Path to the drug
trade, the group has incited peasants, many of whom make their
living from coca cultivation, to rebel against anti-coca projects
in major growing areas. During 1984 several anti-coca projects,
including a United States-supported crop substitution program,
were attacked by armed mobs, resulting in many injuries and
deaths. </p>

<p>In Southeast Asia a number of political insurgent groups rely
principally on heroin smuggling to finance their activities. They
control or influence the main areas of opium production in
northeastern Burma, where the Burmese government does not exert
authority. The insurgents range from ideological revolutionaries
like the Burmese Communist Party (BCP), to ethnic separatists,
such as the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), and opium
warlords, like the Shan United Army (SUA). All of these groups,
whatever their professed objectives, are heavily involved in the
production, transport or sale of heroin. </p>

<p>In Burma, where 90 percent of the southeast Asian opium crop
is grown, the BCP controls an estimated two-thirds of the major
opium production areas and levies a protection tax on
cultivators. While the BCP has traditionally controlled opium
cultivation and the SUA has exclusively dominated associated
refining and trafficking activities, the BCP has recently begun
to engage in processing and sales, and the groups have come into
conflict. The BCP remains an active political insurgency while
the SUA now concentrates its resources almost entirely on the
drug trade. </p>

<p>In Thailand the link between insurgency and drug trafficking
is much weaker. Although Burmese groups operated with relative
impunity on both sides of the Burma/Thailand border in the early
1980's, government initiatives in Thailand have severely
disrupted their activities. The only indigenous Thai insurgent
group of any consequence, the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT),
is reportedly ready to engage in drug trafficking, but has been
kept under control by Thai security forces. </p>

<p>In the Middle East, nearly all the militant groups engage in
struggle in Lebanon - Palestinians, Phalangists, Druze and
Shiites - reportedly are financed in some part by the drug trade.
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley is the site of significant hashish
production; heroin laboratories are also believed to exist in the
area. Terrorists throughout that area can and do enter the drug
trade, either directly or by protecting drugs transshipped
through regions they control. </p>

<p>Armenian terrorists are also active in Lebanon, especially in
Beirut, where Armenian nationals are heavily involved in drug
trafficking. In 1980 Noubar Sofoyan, an Armenian heroin and
hashish trafficker connected with the right-wing Justice
Commandos of the Armenian Genocide, was indicted in the U.S. for
heroin smuggling. Sofoyan allegedly helped fund the 1976 bombing
of a Turkish installation in Zurich. He was arrested in Greece on
drug charges in 1981 and was subsequently extradited to Lebanon
and released; he remains a fugitive today. </p>

<p>Traffickers as Terrorists </p>

<p>While drug traffickers are not by definition terrorists or
insurgents, they rely heavily on terrorist tactics to obtain
limited political objectives. The use of threats, violence,
assassination and kidnapping by trafficking organizations to
prevent vigorous enforcement of drug laws can only be categorized
as terroristic in nature. </p>

<p>The use of terrorist tactics is most evident among traffickers
in Colombia, Peru and Mexico. In Colombia much of the violence
centers on the issue of the extradition of reputed Colombian drug
traffickers to the United States for trial. The extradition issue
has become prominent in the past two years under Colombian
President Belisario Betancur, and has prompted unprecedented
levels of terrorism by traffickers. Two key members of the
Colombian government, Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara-Bonilla
and Justice Ministry Assistant Eduardo Gonzalez, both outspoken
supporters of the implementation of the United States/Colombia
extradition treaty, were murdered reportedly by traffickers in
1984. The Colombian judiciary, the body responsible both for the
investigation of drug cases and the disposition of extradition
requests, has been targeted by traffickers. Twenty-four judges,
among them the judge investigating the Lara assassination, have
been murdered in the past two years. Americans have also been
singled out: Colombian traffickers have reportedly offered a
$350,000 bounty for the murder of any top DEA official in the
United States or in Colombia, and have threatened to kill five
Americans for every reputed Colombian drug trafficker extradited
to the United States. </p>

<p>In Peru drug-related violence has been increasing since 1983,
and has specifically targeted anti-drug efforts in the Upper
Huallaga Valley. A series of violent attacks by traffickers on
police units and eradication workers in that area led to the
November 1984 torture and murder of 19 members of a United
States-financed coca-eradication team, and subsequently to the
brutal murder of 17 United States financed eradicators by about
50 traffickers armed with submachine guns less than one year
later. Dozens of people in Peru, including policemen, mayors and
farmers have been reported killed in the past year in attacks
attributed to cocaine traffickers. </p>

<p>In Mexico trafficking violence culminated in the February
kidnapping, torture and murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camerena and
a Mexican pilot. Camerena's abduction occurred shortly after
Mexican police, alerted by DEA, raided the largest marijuana
plantation ever discovered in that country and seized an
estimated 8,500 tons of marijuana. In the course of the search
for Camerena, five persons, including a police officer, were
killed. Mexican trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero is being held by
Mexican authorities in connection with the Camerena murder. The
trafficking-related violence in Mexico escalated further in
November 1985, when 17 police officers and other members of an
anti-drug team working in southern Mexico were lured into an
ambush, tortured, and killed by a large group of drug traffickers
armed with automatic weapons. </p>

<p>Government Complicity </p>

<p>A number of hostile foreign governments, motivated either by a
need for hard American currency, or by a more ideological desire
to undermine governments in Europe and the United States,
actively facilitate drug trafficking activities. Cuban and
Nicaragua blatantly aid traffickers smuggling drugs from Colombia
to the United States; the Bulgarian government assists
traffickers transporting drug shipments from Southwest Asia to
Western Europe. All three countries are geographically
well-positioned to serve as transshipment points for drugs en
route to Europe or the United States, and all allow trafficking
routes to cross through their sovereign territory, thus providing
a way for traffickers to circumvent drug-interdiction
authorities. </p>

<p>Cuba </p>

<p>Reports of Cuban government involvement in drug trafficking
first surfaced in the early 1960's, but were in large measure
unsubstantiated. A series of reports in the 1970's subsequently
suggested Cuban Government involvement, but did not provide solid
evidence of such activity. In the early 1980's, however, the link
between the Cuban government and Colombian drug traffickers was
documented. In November 1982, the United States District Court
indicted four major Cuban officials on charges of conspiracy to
smuggle drugs; those indicted included the former Cuban
Ambassador to Colombia, two officials of the Cuban Communist
Party, and the Vice Admiral of the Cuban Navy. All four officials
were involved in facilitating the trafficking activities of
Colombian Jaime Guillot-Lara, reputedly a major marijuana,
cocaine and methaqualone trafficker. The Cuban officials,
according to the indictment, agreed to allow Cuba to be used as a
supply and loading center for Lara's ships transporting drugs to
the United States, and permitted him to navigate drug vessels
through Cuban waters to evade United States interdiction
authorities. The Cuban Government reportedly expected large
payments for their role in this traffic; on one occasion, the
government was to receive approximately $800,000 from the sale of
10 million methaqualone pills and approximately 23,000 pounds of
marijuana. </p>

<p>In addition to facilitating maritime trafficking, recent
reports indicate that drug traffickers regularly fly through
otherwise tightly controlled Cuban airspace. Traffickers
apparently have an assigned corridor which they can transit
without challenge from Cuban air defenders. Cuba also reportedly
allows Colombian traffickers to off-load drugs to other carriers
for the final journey to the United States. </p>

<p>It is often difficult in drug trafficking cases to make a
distinction between corrupt high-ranking government officials and
government-sanctioned involvement in the drug trade. Given,
however, the tight controls exerted by the Castro government's
security apparatus over foreign travel and communications, the
drug-related activities which have occurred in Cuba in recent
years almost certainly were known and approved by that country's
highest ranking officials. According to the Department of State: </p>

<p>. . . the evidence clearly indicates more than a case of
corruption by local or mid-level security officials in Cuba . . .
Narcotics trafficking has apparently been sanctioned by Cuba as a
means to finance subversion in Latin America. </p>

<p>Nicaragua </p>

<p>Since 1981, the United States has received a steady stream of
intelligence indicating that Nicaragua is used by drug
traffickers as a transshipment point between Colombia and the
United States, and that officials of the revolutionary government
there, the Sandinista Directorate, are involved in the drug
trade. Evidence further suggests that enforcement measures
implemented by Colombian President Betancur have prompted
Colombian traffickers, notably Jorge Ochoa and Pablo Escobar, to
relocate their cocaine processing facilities to Nicaragua. </p>

<p>The best evidence to date of the link between the Nicaraguan
government and Colombian drug traffickers came to light in 1984.
In that year, pilot Adler Barriman Seal, a former Ochoa cocaine
trafficking pilot working then with the DEA in an undercover
capacity, reported that Escobar and Ochoa had agreed in April
1984 to use Nicaragua as a cocaine smuggling base. At Ochoa's
request, Seal flew 750 kilos of cocaine in June, 1984 from
Colombia to an airfield just northwest of Managua. The airfield
was used generally as a joint facility by the Nicaraguan armed
forces and the Ministry of the Interior. Seal's aircraft was
damaged in the landing, and according to Seal, Frederico Vaughn,
a personal assistant to Interior Minister Thomas Borge, arranged
for him to return to the United States in another plane. Later
that June, Seal returned to the airfield in a C-123 aircraft,
equipped with a hidden camera, to retrieve the drugs. Both Vaughn
and Escobar, escorted by Nicaraguans in uniform and recorded on
videotape, personally helped Seal load the cocaine into the
aircraft. Vaughn was paid $1.5 million for providing the
Colombian traffickers &quot;secure facilities.&quot; </p>

<p>In July 1984, Seal made another trip to Nicaragua from the
United States to bring supplies for a new cocaine processing
complex under construction there. In a subsequent taped
conversation with Seal, Frederico Vaughn stated that the
processing center was ready for use. </p>

<p>Eleven persons, including Vaughn, were indicted by a Federal
grand jury on charges stemming from this trafficking arrangement.
All remain at large. It is highly unlikely that these trafficking
activities occurred without the knowledge and consent of the
Sandinista government. </p>

<p>Bulgaria </p>

<p>Since the late 1970's, reports that many drug dealers,
especially Turkish nationals, operate out of semi-permanent bases
in Bulgaria have been in circulation. The allegations against
Bulgaria include charges that the Bulgarians, primarily through
an official government trading firm, Kintex, officially sanction
the sale of illicit drugs to Western Europe and use the proceeds
from those sales to finance illegal arms transactions and to
bankroll terrorist groups. There are consistent reports that
top-ranking members of the Bulgarian Security Service or
ex-Bulgarian ministers comprise the directorate of Kintex. </p>

<p>Certain smugglers are reportedly permitted to conduct
activities within Bulgaria. In effect, Bulgarian officials,
though Kintex, assign representatives to establish fee
arrangements with smugglers for bartered contraband. Smugglers
trafficking through Bulgaria are primarily Turkish nationals of
Kurdish background, but include Syrian, Jordanian, Lebanese and
European nationals. </p>

<p>Corruption </p>

<p>The Role of the Corrupt Official </p>

<p>The corrupt official is the sine qua non of drug trafficking.
By the corruption of his office, he protects the interest of
traffickers in all phases of growing, processing and smuggling
illicit drugs. Officials &quot;from the lowly constable on
up&quot; are bribed and subverted by traffickers. </p>

<p>Mexico </p>

<p>While United States officials and investigators commonly
acknowledge that corruption among the ranks of both the Mexican
Federal Judicial Police and the Directorate of Security
facilitates drug trafficking in and through that country, they
are hesitant to make open accusations concerning the relationship
between corrupt officials and traffickers. Their reasoning is
persuasive: Mexico is a neighbor and an ally, a politically and
economically unstable one at that. The government of President
Miguel de la Madrid appears sincere in its efforts to improve the
quality of drug law enforcement throughout the country.
Nonetheless, mounting evidence prompted the Department of State
to assert in its 1985 mid-year report to Congress that: </p>

<p>There are strong indications that the Mexican [drug] program
has been less effective over the past two years, and that
corruption is playing a major role in this decline. </p>

<p>Drug-related corruption among members of Mexico's Federal
police force, which was widespread and well-publicized in the
1970's, continues to undermine anti-drug efforts in that country.
Allegations of corruption surfaced in March 1985, after DEA agent
Enrique Camarena Salazar and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar
were kidnapped and murdered in Guadalajara. Six Mexican police
officers were indicted on charges related to the Camarena murder;
they were charged with assisting drug traffickers through
&quot;protection of personnel and goods, custody of drugs in
transit, as well as continuing services of information.&quot; The
arrested officers have reportedly confessed that drug traffickers
offered them between $200 to $6,250 a month for official
protection. </p>

<p>In connection with the Camarena case, DEA officials maintain
that Jorge Armando Pavon Reyes, the First Commandante of the
Mexican Federal Judicial Police, who directed the investigation
into the Camarena murder, accepted a bribe from the trafficker
suspect in the killing, Rafael Caro Quintero, and in return
allowed Caro to leave Guadalajara. Later apprehended in Costa
Rica, Caro claimed in a confession that he paid Pavon Reyes
$265,000 to avoid arrest at the Guadalajara airport. Despite his
denials of the charges, Pavon Reyes was indicted for the crime in
Mexico in April 1985. </p>

<p>United States pressure after the Camerena murder and
subsequent revelations of corruption prompted a number of quick
responses from the Mexican Government. President de la Madrid
announced a major reorganization and consolidation of the police
forces under stronger Federal control; the governor of one
Mexican state dismissed that state's entire judicial system,
including the state attorney general, police and administrative
personnel; and a reported 100 agents of the Federal Security
Directorate, a political police force and counterintelligence
unit run by the Interior Ministry, resigned in the face of
corruption allegations. Corruption in at least some Mexican
institutions, however, appears to be deeply embedded and not
likely to be eliminated quickly or easily. At the end of
September, 1985, six months after the Camerena murder, evidence
of Mexican corruption continued to surface as the members of the
United States Fraternal Order of Border Patrol Agents charged
that: </p>

<p>Mexican federal agents, using the latest in radio and
scanner-equipped cars and armed with automatic weapons, have been
providing transit security for huge loads of domestically
produced marijuana and heroin and in-transit cocaine. </p>

<p>Bahamas and Caribbean </p>

<p>The Bahamas and a number of Caribbean countries serve as a
major refueling transshipment points for traffickers transporting
illicit drugs from Mexico and South America to the United States.
Corruption among officials at all levels throughout these
countries appears to be widespread. </p>

<p>Drug-related corruption has reached the highest offices of
government in the British-held Turks and Caicos Islands, where in
March 1985, that country's Chief Minister, Norman Saunders, was
convicted of conspiracy to travel in furtherance of a drug plot
and on five counts of traveling in furtherance of in illicit drug
transaction. Saunders, the first foreign head of state to be
convicted on drug charges, was found not guilty of more serious
charges of conspiracy to smuggle marijuana and cocaine. Trial
witnesses testified that Saunders accepted a total of $50,000 to
allow drugs to move freely through his island chain. He planned
to use the islands as a &quot;safe-haven&quot; for traffickers
smuggling illicit drugs from Colombia to the United States.
Stafford Missick, Minister of Commerce and Development in the
Saunders government, was convicted of conspiracy to import
cocaine and marijuana in the case; a third indicted Turks and
Caicos official, Aulden Smith, has not yet been tried. </p>

<p>In the Bahamas, a 1984 Commission of Inquiry investigating
drug trafficking through the Islands reported that Bahamian
officials &quot;from policemen to cabinet minister&quot; allowed
the Islands to be used as a transshipment point for illicit drugs
in return for sizeable bribes. A majority of the three-man
Commission concluded that no credible evidence directly tied
Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden Pindling to the drug-related
corruption, but noted that Pindling's bank accounts reflected
deposits of $3.5 million in excess of his salary between 1977 and
1983. </p>

<p>The Commission of Inquiry noted that a number of the Family
Island Commissioners, the representatives of the central
government on nearly all the Bahamian Islands: </p>

<p>claimed they either had no direct knowledge of drug
trafficking or had never received any complaints regarding such
activity . . . We find that to be quite remarkable and we do not
believe that they were being candid with us . . . they could not
help but know what was going on in relation to drug trafficking.
We have concluded that there must have been a degree of
acquiescence on their part . . . </p>

<p>The Commission report also charged that Colombian cocaine
trafficker Carlos Enrique Lehder Rivas operated an extensive
cocaine enterprise in the Bahamian Island of Norman's Cay from
1978 until 1982, and the Lehder paid &quot;substantial
bribes&quot; to various ranks of policemen and customs officials
to facilitate his illicit drug activities. </p>

<p>Former trafficker Luis Carcia, who transshipped marijuana and
cocaine through the Bahamas on a regular basis in the late 1970's
and early 1980's testified before the President's Commission on
Organized Crime that he had: </p>

<p>. . . never seen corruption such as there is in the Bahamas.
The policemen used to plead with me to use airstrips in their
territory so they could received the pay-off . . . sometimes
off-duty police unloaded the stuff from the plane and into the
boats for me . . . we always operated out of the Bahamas because
of the total corruption there. </p>

<p>South America </p>

<p>Official corruption has seriously hindered anti-drug efforts
throughout South America, especially in Bolivia and Peru.
Throughout Bolivia during the 1980's regime of General Garcia
Meza, corruption among high-level officials charged with drug
enforcement was so rampant that &quot;the government itself
became an international drug trafficker.&quot; Despite the
subsequent efforts the current Bolivian government to more
effectively enforce drug control laws, corruption at all levels
of the Bolivian government remains a major problem. In 1983, for
example, Bolivian authorities arrested two suspected traffickers
with a small amount of cocaine and confiscated a 14,000 acre
ranch and two airplanes belonging to them. Two weeks later, the
men were transferred to the authority of a local prosecutor who
subsequently released them and returned their possessions.
According the reports, at least $250,000 in bribes were paid to
Bolivian police and government officials for the release of the
two traffickers. </p>

<p>In August 1985, officials in Peru began a drug corruption
investigation that country's entire Interior Ministry after
authorities discovered direct telephone lines linking reputed
cocaine trafficker Reynaldo Rodriguez Lopes to officials at the
Mexican Consulate in Peru. Officials also found a government car
belonging to a top aid of former Interior Minister and Prime
Minister Luis Percovich parked in front of Lopes' home. </p>

<p>These are a few among many examples. Corruption linked to drug
trafficking is a widespread phenomenon among political and
military leaders, police and other authorities in virtually every
country touched by the drug trade. The easily available and
enormous amounts of money generated through drug transaction
present a temptation too great for many in positions of authority
to resist. </p>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<p><b>Note from Cliff Schaffer:</b> </p>

<p>This chapter is a summary of some of the major events in
American drug prohibition. What is most interesting about this
chapter is what it leaves out. For example, elsewhere in these
pages you will find numerous historical references to the racial
motives behind these laws. In this chapter, there is only a
passing reference to an opium law restricting trade by the
Chinese. </p>

<p>In addition, the chapter spends a good deal of time talking
about President Nixon's administration and the reorganization
which took place, but fails to mention that Nixon commissioned
the largest study of drug policy in American history, which
disagreed with his policy. </p>

<h2>Chapter IV Part 1: Federal Drug Strategy... </h2>

<p>Federal Drug Strategy: Origins, Evolution, and Current Status </p>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>The Federal response to the national problems of drug abuse
and drug trafficking over the years has been both dynamic and
characterized by frustration. Drug use and its concomitant
organized crime effects continue to challenge the Nation to
develop a more effective and sophisticated response. Typically, a
particular Federal enforcement reaction to drug abuse and drug
trafficking has prompted drug traffickers and drug abusers to
take defensive actions, which in turn have required new or
different governmental responses. This reactive process has been
particularly characteristic of the Federal effort over the last
two decades. </p>

<p>The history of Federal drug policy that follows demonstrates
that approaches to reduce supply have been the preferred and
dominant Federal response over the last 75 years. It is only
relatively recently that the nature of the drug supply-demand
dynamic has become widely understood, leading to an increased
appreciation for and emphasis on programs to reduce demand, and
that there is still no consensus on what the role of the Federal
government in the national campaign against drug trafficking and
drug abuse should be. </p>

<p>The Early Years </p>

<p>Although use of drugs has been viewed by many Americans as a
medical problem or a personal moral shortcoming throughout this
country's history, laws regulating or proscribing such use are of
relatively recent vintage. The first significant piece of
prohibitory legislation relating to drugs in the United States
was an ordinance enacted in 1875 by the city of San Francisco
prohibiting the operation of opium dens, commercial
establishments in which the smoking of opium occurred. One
western state after another followed San Francisco's lead and
enacted legislation prohibiting opium smoking. Within eight years
of the passage of the San Francisco ordinance, Congress raised
the tariff on smoking opium, which was a relatively mild form of
opium, from $6 to $10 a pound; the tariff on opium had first been
imposed in 1842. In 1887, apparently in response to obligations
imposed upon the United States by a Chinese-American commercial
treaty negotiated in 1880, Congress prohibited the importation of
smoking opium by Chinese subjects. Despite these first
legislative efforts, the incidence of drug use and addiction
increased, as did societal concern and illegal drug smuggling. </p>

<p>Although estimates concerning the number of drug addicts
during the 50 years prior to the passage of drug legislation in
1914 are inherently suspect, the available information suggests
that drug abuse during that period was a &quot;major
medico-social problem.&quot; In fact, by 1909, the United States
was confronted with a significant and growing drug problem. The
increased opiate use and addiction in the United States
subsequent to the Civil War has been attributed to several
factors, including the indiscriminate use of morphine to treat
battlefield casualties during the Civil War. The increase in
morphine addiction was such that the phrase &quot;army
disease&quot; was used to describe the drug use among
ex-soldiers. The widespread administration of morphine by
hypodermic syringe also contributed to the increase in opiate
abuse. Other circumstances, which exacerbated the situation
during the period of 1865-1914, included the spread of opium
smoking from Chinese immigrants to American citizens, the use of
opium and its derivatives by the American patent medicine
industry, and the marketing of heroin beginning in 1898 as a
safe, powerful, and non-addictive substitute for the opium
derivatives morphine and codeine. </p>

<p>The American Opium Commission, established by an Act of
Congress in early 1908, investigated domestic opium use during
that year. In response to the results of this investigation,
Congress passed &quot;An Act to Prohibit the Importation and Use
of Opium for Other Than Medicinal Purposes&quot; in 1909, which
among other things, permitted the importation of opium for
medicinal purposes but only to 12 ports of entry. However, it did
not regulate domestic opium production and manufacture or the
interstate shipment of opium products: </p>

<p>Opium products were still available without a physician's
prescription and were being marketed throughout the country
through retail outlets and a growing mail order trade. </p>

<p>Another motivation for the passage of the 1909 Act was the
realization that the United States could not continue to advocate
measures to ameliorate the opium problem in the Far East without
taking serious steps to deal with its own &quot;home
problem.&quot; Although considered a necessary first step, the
1909 Act was subsequently adjudged to be seriously defective in
that it &quot;contain[ed] no provision against the possible
intrastate manufacture of smoking opium. It [did] no more than
exclude this form of the drug from the United States.&quot;
Because few States had effective laws against the manufacture of
smoking opium in addition to the proscriptions on its sale and
use, that gap could frustrate the objectives of Federal and State
laws. </p>

<p>Shortly before the enactment of the Act of 1909 an
International Opium Commission, consisting of the representatives
of 13 nations was convened in Shanghai at the initiative of the
United States. The Shanghai Commission has been described as the
&quot;first international effort at the solution of the opium
problem.&quot; Although originally conceived of as an
organization for investigating Far East opium use and
trafficking, the Shanghai Commission was transformed into a body
for examining worldwide opium use and trafficking because opium
addiction had spread to other parts of the world, especially to
the United States, and because producer countries were not
restricted to the Far East. The Shanghai Convention unanimously
adopted several resolutions for consideration by the governments
of the participating nations, including the following three: </p>

<p>(1) Consider the desirability of reviewing each country's
system of regulation of the use of opium in light of the
discrepancies among countries' regulatory systems; </p>

<p>(2) Adopt measures to prevent the exporting of opium and its
derivatives to countries which prohibit the importation of such
items; and </p>

<p>(3) Take measures for the gradual suppression of opium smoking
in each country's own territories and possessions. </p>

<p>Because of the unanimity achieved by the Shanghai Commission,
the United States on September 1, 1909, proposed to the other
participating countries that an international conference be held
to &quot;conventionalize the resolutions adopted at Shanghai and
their necessary consequences.&quot; The conference, which was
held at The Hague, began on December 1, 1911, and resulted in the
signing of the International Opium Convention on January 23,
1912. The Convention was ratified by the United States Senate on
October 18, 1913. The International Opium Convention committed
its signatories to the enactment of laws designed to suppress the
&quot;abuse of opium, morphine, cocaine as well as drugs prepared
or derived from these substances . . . In response to this
international obligation and to domestic considerations, the
United States passed the Harrison Act on December 17, 1914 (Ch.
1, 38 Stat. 785) , which &quot;became the cornerstone of domestic
narcotics policy&quot; for nearly 65 years. </p>

<p>The Harrison Act: 1914-1936, Early Years of Enforcement </p>

<p>Section 1 of the Harrison Act provided that any person who was
in the business of dealing in the covered drugs was required to
register annually and to pay a special annual tax of one dollar.
Section 2 made it illegal for any person to sell or in any way to
give away any of the covered drugs, except pursuant to the
written order of the person to whom the drug was being sold or
given; the written order was required to be on a form issued by
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Section 4 made it unlawful
for anyone who had not previously registered and paid the special
tax, required by Section 1 of the Act, to engage in interstate
trafficking in the drugs listed. With the exception of employees
of registrants and patients of physicians and dentists, Section 8
prohibited the possession of any of the drugs covered by the Act
by any person who had not registered and paid the special tax
imposed by Section I. Section 9 provided that the punishment for
any violation of the Act was to be not more than $2,000 or not
more than 5 years in prison or both. Finally, Section 10 gave the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, subject to the approval of the
Secretary of the Treasury, the responsibility for enforcing the
Act. </p>

<p>The history of enforcement under the Harrison Act was
tremendously affected by Congress' chosen source of authority for
the legislation, its constitutional power to lay and collect
taxes. The principle of Federalism and the related concept of the
States' police power were effective constraints on the scope of
the Federal government's powers at the time of the Harrison Act,
hence the use of the constitutional authority to tax to regulate
drug-related activity. </p>

<p>Because the Harrison Act was superficially a measure designed
to raise revenue, its stated purpose dictated that the
enforcement of the Statute be the responsibility of the Treasury
Department and, by the statute's own terms, of the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue. Despite its revenue-raising veneer, its
regulatory purpose was acknowledged from the beginning: </p>

<p>Certain individuals viewed the Harrison Act as a rational way
to limit addiction and drug abuse through taxation and
regulation. It was a regulatory device which, according to the
American opium Commission, &quot;would bring the whole traffic
and use of these drugs into the light of day and, therefore,
create a public opinion against the use of them that would be
more important, perhaps, than the Act itself&quot; (Dr. Hamilton
Wright, American Opium Commission). The Act was heralded as a
method of drug abuse control and as a public awareness tool. </p>

<p>The history of early enforcement efforts under the Harrison
Act, and of the nation's drug abuse problem and policy generally,
was affected in no small degree by a series of Supreme Court
decisions that were handed down during the decade immediately
following passage of the Act. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of the
Harrison Act in United States v. Doremus. In deciding the issues
raised by the Government's appeal of the dismissal of the
indictment against a physician who had been registered under the
Act, the Supreme Court set forth general principles that governed
its resolution of the issues: </p>

<p>If the legislation enacted has some reasonable relation to the
exercise of the taxing authority conferred by the Constitution,
it cannot be invalidated because of the supposed motives which
induced it. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>The Act may not be declared unconstitutional because its
effect may be to accomplish another purpose as well as the
raising of revenue. If the legislation is within the taxing
authority of Congress - that is sufficient to sustain it. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of Section 2
of the Act on the ground that it did relate to the raising of
revenue. </p>

<p>On the same day that the Supreme Court decided Doremus, it
also answered in Webb v. United States the following question in
the negative: whether an order for morphine, which is issued by a
physician to a habitual user who is not under his professional
care and which is issued not for the purpose of curing the habit
but for maintenance, is a &quot;prescription.&quot; It did so
because it concluded that &quot;to call such an order . . . a
physician's prescription would be so plain a perversion of
meaning that no discussion of the subject is required.&quot; </p>

<p>The Court extended its Webb Ruling in United States v. Behrman
by holding that an order issued by a physician for large doses of
proscribed drugs, which were not prescribed for the purpose of
treating a condition other than the addiction itself and which
were to be self-administered by the addict, to a person, who was
addicted and who was under the physician's personal care,
constituted a violation of the Harrison Act. In doing so, the
Court implicitly agreed with the district judge that
&quot;prescriptions in the regular course of practice did not
include the indiscriminate doling out of narcotics in such
quantity to addicts as charged in the indictments.&quot; </p>

<p>The Harrison Act, as construed by the Supreme Court, was the
statutory framework within which Federal drug strategies were
devised and implemented over the next half-century. However,
early enforcement efforts and priorities under the Harrison Act
did have somewhat unintended and undesirable consequences. </p>

<p>As noted previously, the responsibility for enforcement of the
Harrison Act was given initially to the Commissioner of Revenue,
subject to review by the Secretary of the Treasury. In 1915, 162
collectors and agents in the Miscellaneous Division of the
Internal Revenue Service were given the responsibility under the
Harrison Act for restricting the sale of proscribed drugs.
Meanwhile, the administration and enforcement of the National
Prohibition or the Volstead Act, which was adopted to enforce the
Eighteenth Amendment, was committed to the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue who created a prohibition unit. Because it
seemed logical to place responsibility for enforcement of the
Harrison Act within this Prohibition Unit, a Narcotics Division
was created in that unit in 1919 with a staff of 170 agents and
an appropriation of $270,000. This organizational unit for the
enforcement of the Harrison Act existed until April 1, 1927, when
legislation creating a Bureau of Prohibition and a Bureau of
Customs, to be headed by Commissioners, within the Department of
Treasury, was enacted. The 1927 legislation also transferred to
the Secretary of the Treasury all powers and duties that had been
conferred by the revenue and prohibition laws upon the
Commissioner of Revenue relating to intoxicating liquors and
narcotics. In addition, the Secretary was authorized to delegate
such powers and duties to the Commissioners of Prohibition and
Internal Revenue. The enforcement of the narcotics laws
subsequently was delegated to a narcotics unit under the
direction of the Deputy Commissioner of Prohibition. </p>

<p>Enforcement efforts under the Harrison Act from 1914 through
1929 were controversial. Following the expansive constructions of
the Harrison Act by the Supreme Court in Doremus, Webb, and
Behrman, thousands of additional prosecutions were undertaken as
a result of investigations conducted by agents of the Narcotics
Division of the Prohibition Unit. It has been estimated that over
50,000 individuals, including many physicians and others who were
required to register under the Act, were charged with violating
the Act during the period of 1914-1922. After this initial burst
of arrest activity directed against registrants, the Narcotics
Division turned its attention to closing clinics that had been
established to conduct research and treat large numbers of
addicts who could not afford private care. Because of pressure by
the American Medical Association, which had initially welcomed
the Harrison Act but which later came to view the actions of the
Narcotics Division as harassment and an improper Federal
intrusion into the practice of medicine, the Department of the
Treasury encouraged its agents to focus on the &quot;blatantly
illegal importation and sale of narcotics.&quot; </p>

<p>Despite this change in enforcement direction, the earlier
enforcement focus had a damaging, long-term impact. Because of
the mere threat of prosecution under the Act, the &quot;interest
of physicians in these cases [of narcotic addiction]&quot;
declined and &quot;they even began to refuse to prescribe.&quot;
In closing the clinics, which had been established to treat those
who were unable to afford private care, the Federal government
may have impeded - albeit unintentionally - research into
narcotic effects, use and addiction and as a result interfered
with the development of efficacious medical treatment. Finally,
the Federal government's early success in decreasing the supply
of narcotic drugs from licit sources, i.e., registrants, to drug
users forced those users to seek out illicit sources of supply. </p>

<p>The history of enforcement of the Harrison Act during the
fifteen years following its enactment illustrates the operation
of a principle that has been validated repeatedly since that
tine: drug demand will result in the creation of supply channels
to satisfy the demand. An effective drug abuse policy requires a
systematic and long-term demand reduction component;
unfortunately, there was no such component of the Federal policy
in the more than 50 years following the enactment of the Harrison
Act. </p>

<p>Enforcement efforts were burdened, however, by public
dissatisfaction with the activities of the Narcotics Division,
which was tainted by its association with the country's
anti-liquor laws. The public dissatisfaction intensified because
of a scandal involving falsification of arrest records and
charges relating to payoffs by, and collusion with, drug dealers.
In response, Congress removed the responsibility for enforcing
the Federal drug laws from the Bureau of Prohibition, which was
itself incorporated into the Department of Justice. Drug
enforcement was transferred in 1930 to a newly created Federal
Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) within the Department of the Treasury,
which was headed by a Commissioner of Narcotics. Although the FBN
was primarily responsible for the enforcement of the Harrison Act
and related drug laws, the task of preventing and interdicting
the illegal importation and smuggling of drugs remained with the
Bureau of Customs. With one major exception to be discussed at
the beginning of the next section, the Federal statutory and
organizational structure relating to narcotics that existed on
July 1, 1930, remained in place for the next 35 years. </p>

<p>1937-1969: Intensification of Pressure for Change in Federal
Drug Policy </p>

<p>Marijuana was not made subject to the Harrison Act or to the
Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act (the Jones-Miller Act)
because it was not viewed as a particularly dangerous drug. In
addition, because of its use in the making of rope, twine,
veterinary medicines, and other products, marijuana's commercial
value was thought to outweigh any deleterious effects from its
abuse. However, as marijuana use became widespread in America,
concern about its use also spread. Due to the efforts of a
&quot;small but vocal group of crusaders,&quot; the States began
to pass legislation to prohibit all marijuana-related activity.
By 1931, &quot;all but two states West of the Mississippi and
several more in the East had enacted prohibitory legislation
making it a criminal offense to possess or use the drug.&quot;
The FBN initially minimized the dangers of marijuana use, and in
its 1932 annual report, it instead urged the States to adopt a
Uniform State Narcotics Law. Such a law was drafted in 1932, and
it included an optional marijuana provision. </p>

<p>By 1937 every state had prohibited marijuana use. However,
faced with continuing intensive lobbying efforts, the FBN did
become an &quot;ardent supporter&quot; of marijuana legislation,
which finally was embodied in the Marihuana Tax Act 1937. </p>

<p>The Marihuana Tax Act was nominally a revenue measure
patterned after the Harrison Narcotic Act. It required that any
person whose business related to marijuana to register and pay a
special tax. In addition, the transference of marijuana had to be
pursuant to a written order on a form issued by the Secretary of
the Treasury and the transferee was required to pay a tax of
$1.00/ounce if he had registered and $100.00/ounce if he had not.
Finally, the Act made the transferor liable for the transfer tax
if a transfer were made without an order form and without payment
of the tax by the transferee. </p>

<p>From the late 1930's through the 1950's, the FBN's enforcement
efforts were directed almost exclusively at disrupting the
illegal importation of drugs into this country and to making
cases against distributors and dealers. Indeed, in 1942 the FBN
recognized that it was necessary to eradicate crops in Mexico if
its interdiction efforts were to achieve greater success. In that
same year Congress enacted the Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942,
which, among other things, prohibited the domestic production of
the poppy without FBN permission. </p>

<p>During a great part of this period the FBN was handicapped to
some degree by a shortage of agents and inadequate budgets. In
the Spring of 1956, a Congressional Committee found that: </p>

<p>[FBN] is one of the few Federal agencies whose personnel and
funds have not been increased to reflect population growth and
greater responsibility. Over a period of 25 years, the Federal
narcotic laws have been enforced with a force of approximately
227 agents and an average budget of less than $2 million. This
restriction on manpower and operating funds has seriously
curtailed investigations of the illicit traffic in the United
States and of sources of supply in foreign countries. </p>

<p>Because of budget limitations, the present force of 250
Federal narcotic agents is 25 short of the number authorized by
the Congress. By way of comparison, New York City has
approximately 200 police officers assigned specifically to
narcotic enforcement. </p>

<p>These statistics suggest that, during this time, drug abuse
and trafficking were not the Federal priorities that they are
today. </p>

<p>Despite the handicaps that the FBN operated under during this
period, it nevertheless enjoyed a degree of success. According to
LCN informer Joseph Valachi, the tactics used by the FBN to
infiltrate and disrupt trafficking organizations caused some LCN
chieftains to rethink the advisability of their continued
participation in the drug trade. According to Valachi, Frank
Costello, then acting boss of the Luciano Family, ordered its
members to stop trafficking in drugs in 1948. One of the
principal reasons for the edict was explained as follows: </p>

<p>Much more important . . . was the dogged harassment of the
Bureau of Narcotics. The Cosa Nostra despised - and feared - [the
FBN] . . . . </p>

<p>The Narcotics Bureau, unlike the FBI, which tends to look down
its nose at it, does not depend on the informant system for much
of its intelligence but regularly engages its agents in dangerous
undercover work; they are, as a result, . . . highly motivated,
less disciplined, generally more daring and innovational,
occasionally corruptible. Above all else, the [FBN] was the first
to recognize the existence of an organization like the Cosa
Nostra, and no other arm of the law has put more of a crimp in
its operation. </p>

<p>Although continuing to warn of the dangers of drug use, the
FBN, especially during the earlier part of the period,
&quot;adopted a more moderate approach in its dealings with
Congress as well as the American people.&quot; The Bureau's
approach reflected the attitude of the American public, which
appeared to consider the drug problem to be restricted to small
groups at the periphery of society, with no great societal
impact. </p>

<p>In the 1950's the rather complacent attitude toward the drug
problem began to change. The first indication of greater concern
was reflected in the enactment of the Boggs Act on November 2,
1951, which generally increased the penalties for violations of
the narcotic and marijuana laws. The primary motivations for the
passage of the Boggs Act were the inadequacy of penalties under
the existing law as deterrents and an increase in drug addiction.
With respect to the former, Congress relied on statistics showing
that the rate of recidivism among drug violators had increased
substantially over a 15- year period of time; in 1935, 40 percent
of those convicted of narcotics violations had prior drug
convictions, while 63.6 percent of those convicted and sentenced
during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1950 were recidivists.
Congress concluded that drug addiction was increasing on the
basis of statistics showing that between 1946 and 1950 there had
been a 100 percent increase in the number of narcotic
laws-related arrests and that the average age of persons
committed to a Public Health Service Hospital had declined from
37.5 to 26.7 years, over a five year period. </p>

<p>Encouraged by the purported success of the Boggs Act, Congress
passed the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, which further increased
the penalties for drug violations. Among other things, this 1956
Act raised the permissive maximum sentences for violations of the
narcotic possession statutes; imposed new mandatory minimum
sentences and increased the permissive maximums for trafficking
violations; eliminated probation, suspension of service, or
parole for all cases except those involving a first offender
possessor; authorized FBN and Customs agents to carry firearms
and to execute and serve search and arrest warrants; made the
sale of heroin to individuals under 18 years of age a capital
offense, although the death penalty was not made mandatory but
could be imposed only if the jury specifically so directed; and
made the smuggling of marijuana a violation of the Narcotic Drugs
Import and Export Act. </p>

<p>The severe penalties imposed by the Narcotic Control Act of
1956 were adopted even though Congress found that, as a result of
the Boggs Act, &quot;narcotic addiction and the illicit narcotic
traffic [were] generally on the decline in the United
States.&quot; Because the stringent penalties imposed by the
Boggs Act were thought to be successful in decreasing drug
addiction, the 84th Congress concluded that the imposition of
even more severe penalties would &quot;be the strongest and most
effective deterrent to narcotic addiction and illicit drug
traffic.&quot; Finally, Congress was of the view in enacting the
Narcotic Control Act of 1956 that &quot;suppression of the
illicit drug traffic&quot; would be the most important
contribution that the Federal Government could make to the
successful and permanent rehabilitation of drug addicts. Congress
thus sought to reduce the demand for drugs through reducing their
supply. </p>

<p>Public concern over the problem of drug abuse, which had been
relatively dormant during the 1940's and 1950's, flared during
the 1960's. The intensification of the national concern resulted
in increasing pressure for Federal initiatives in the area. In
response to this development, a White House Conference on
Narcotics and Drug Abuse was convened in 1962, which resulted in
the establishment of the President's Advisory Commission on
Narcotics and Drug Abuse (Prettyman Commission) on January 15,
1963. </p>

<p>The Prettyman Commission's final report, submitted to
President Kennedy in November 1963, included 25 recommendations,
the substance of several of which were: </p>

<p>(1) Transfer the enforcement and investigative functions of
the FBN relating to illicit transactions in narcotic drugs and
marijuana from the Department of Treasury to the Department of
Justice; </p>

<p>(2) Transfer the responsibilities of the FBN relating to the
regulation of the legitimate traffic in narcotic drugs and
marijuana from the Department of the Treasury to the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare; </p>

<p>(3) Substantially increase the number of Federal agents
assigned to the investigation of the illicit importation of and
trafficking in narcotic drugs, marijuana, and dangerous drugs; </p>

<p>(4) Transfer the responsibility for investigating the illicit
traffic in dangerous drugs from the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare to the Department of Justice; and </p>

<p>(5) Strictly control, by Federal statute, all non-narcotic
drugs capable of producing serious psychotoxic effects when
abused. </p>

<p>Within 18 months of the issuance of the Commission's final
report, Congress adopted the recommendation regarding the
diversion of &quot;dangerous drugs&quot; from legal channels. The
resulting Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 mandated, among
other things, record-keeping and inspection requirements for
depressant and stimulant drugs, and specifically for barbiturates
and amphetamines, &quot;throughout the chain of distribution,
from the basic manufacturer to (but not including) the ultimate
consumer.&quot; The Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 were
passed because of perceived serious problems associated with the
diversion of depressant and stimulant drugs from licit channels: </p>

<p>[T]estimony showed that over 9 billion barbiturate and
amphetamine tablets are produced annually in the United States.
It is estimated that over 50 percent, or 4 1/2 billion tablets,
are distributed through illicit channels. The human toll of drug
abuse cannot be measured for it affects not only the abuser but
his family and the community around him. Drug abuse is closely
bound up with juvenile delinquency. It also contributes to the
rising crime rate in the United States. </p>

<p>To carry out the new enforcement obligations imposed by the
Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 another agency was created;
a Bureau of Drug Abuse Control (BDAC) was established within the
Department's Food and Drug Administration. The Bureau of Customs,
however, retained responsibility for the enforcement of laws
relating to the importing and exporting of depressant and
stimulants drugs. With the establishment of the BDAC on February
1, 1966, the Department of the Treasury's virtual monopoly of the
enforcement of Federal drug laws ended. </p>

<p>Within 16 months of the enactment of the Drug Abuse Control
Amendments of 1965 Congress passed an enlightened piece of
legislation: The Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966. This
Act did many things, including: authorizing a district court to
order the civil commitment of an individual, who was an addict,
who had been charged with certain offenses against the United
States, and who elected to do so, to the Surgeon General for
treatment of his addiction and rehabilitation, in lieu of
prosecution; requiring a district court to commit an individual
who had been convicted of certain offenses against the United
States and who was an addict to the custody of the Attorney
General for treatment and rehabilitation; permitting any narcotic
addict to file a petition with a United States Attorney
requesting that he be admitted to a Public Health Service
hospital for treatment and rehabilitation; and authorizing the
Surgeon General to establish rehabilitation and
post-hospitalization care programs for narcotic addicts and to
provide financial assistance to the States to establish similar
programs. </p>

<p>As the House Committee on Judiciary, one of the Congressional
committees which reported on the proposed bill, observed, the
Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966: </p>

<p>. . . mark[e]d a fundamental reorientation toward the problem
of narcotics addiction. The Attorney General in his testimony
before the Committee stated that for too long the law had
stressed punitive solutions and neglected medical and
rehabilitative measures. </p>

<p>The 1966 Act embodied a proposition that had tended to be
overlooked in the past: successful treatment and permanent
rehabilitation of drug users, i.e., reduction of demand for
drugs, must be an essential component of Federal law enforcement
efforts. </p>

<p>A detailed evaluation of the Federal drug strategy that was
released in 1979 accurately summarized what the Federal approach
had been prior to the late 1960's: </p>

<p>Early efforts to deal with the problem primarily focused on
reducing the supply of drugs, first through taxation, then by
prohibition and strict legal control. The basic assumption . . .
was that reducing supply and availability of drugs would lead to
reduction in their use by encouraging drug-dependent individuals
to detoxify, and by keeping drugs out of the hands of users. </p>

<p>By the end of the 1950's there was a general agreement on the
part of both the public and legislators that the Federal policy
of strict supply reduction by itself was not enough. During the
1960's and early 1970's, as drug abuse increased and spread to
new markets, the almost exclusive emphasis on supply reduction
and stiff penalties was challenged with growing frequency,
leading to increased research and experimentation with treatment
for drug abusers. </p>

<p>Beginning in 1968, in response to rising . . . concern . . .,
a variety of changes occurred in an attempt to curtail drug
abuse. </p>

<p>Despite the work of the Prettyman Commission and the enactment
of the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, public agitation
concerning crime in general, and drug abuse in particular,
intensified. In response, President Lyndon B. Johnson established
the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration
of Justice (Katzenbach Commission) in 1966 to undertake a
&quot;comprehensive study of the nation's crime problem and to
provid[e] recommendations to coordinate its eradication on all
fronts.&quot; The Katzenbach Commission issued a report in 1967,
which included a chapter on drug abuse. The substance of several
of the Katzenbach Commission's recommendations addressed both the
demand and supply of drugs: </p>

<p>(1) Substantially increase the enforcement staffs of FBN and
the Bureau of Customs; </p>

<p>(2) Permit courts and correctional authorities to deal
flexibly with violators of the drug laws; </p>

<p>(3) Undertake research to develop a sound and effective
framework of regulatory and criminal laws relating to dangerous
drugs; and </p>

<p>(4) The National Institute of Mental Health should develop a
core of educational and informational materials relating to
drugs. </p>

<p>Drawing on the recommendations of the Prettyman Commission,
President Johnson sent a reorganization plan restructuring the
Federal drug law enforcement effort to Congress for its
consideration on February 7, 1968. In terms that have been
repeated often since that time, President Johnson explained the
reason for the proposed consolidation of drug enforcement
responsibilities: </p>

<p>Today, Federal investigation and enforcement of our narcotics
laws are fragmented. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>Neither [the FBN nor the BADC] is in the agency which is
primarily concerned with Federal law enforcement - the Department
of Justice. </p>

<p>This separation of responsibilities . . . has complicated and
hindered our response to a national menace. </p>

<p>Among the most significant provisions of the plan, which
became effective on April 7, 1968, were the following: the
Department of Justice was given a major responsibility for the
enforcement of the Federal drug laws for the first time in
history by the creation within it of a Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs (BNDD); the FBN was abolished, and its drug
enforcement duties and responsibilities were shifted to BNDD; and
BDAC was also abolished, and its drug enforcement duties and
responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice. </p>

<p>The 1968 reorganization did not significantly affect the
revenue collection functions exercised by IRS under the Harrison
and Marijuana Tax Acts or the responsibility of the Bureau of
Customs for interdicting the smuggling of narcotics and
marijuana. The Plan that was intended to eliminate fragmentation
in Federal drug law enforcement thus did not eliminate it
entirely. </p>

<p>Although neither House of Congress blocked the 1968
reorganization plan, criticism of it did develop. While in
agreement that merger of the FBN and BDAC would eliminate
friction and duplication of effort, Congressional opponents
expressed skepticism that law enforcement relating to drugs and
organized crime would be in any way improved by transferring the
merged entity to the Department of Justice. Because
Administration spokesmen had acknowledged that BDAC and the FBN
had been effective law enforcement agencies, the opponents of the
plan recommended that the merged entity should instead be located
within the Department of the Treasury, where coordination with
IRS and Customs, both of which had drug law enforcement
responsibilities, could be better assured. That the BNDD was
apparently not to be placed within the FBI was one factor leading
the dissenters to conclude that &quot;greater overall efficiency
in crime enforcement&quot; would not be achieved by the placement
of the merged entity into Justice. </p>

<p>Federal Drug Law Enforcement: From Implementation of the 1968
Reorganization Plan to October 27, 1970. </p>

<p>Two major issues during the 1968 Presidential campaign were
crime and drugs. Shortly after his inauguration, President
Richard M. Nixon declared war on both and formed Task Force One
in the spring of 1969 to &quot;design programs that would have an
immediate effect on the importation of heroin and other illegal
drugs.&quot; Task Force One developed and implemented Operation
Intercept, the &quot;first major interagency attempt at border
interdiction,&quot; which involved more than 2,000 Customs, INS
Border Patrol, and BNDD agents. Because the amount of illegal
drugs seized as a result of Operation Intercept was
disappointingly small and because the venture seriously strained
relations between Mexico and the United States, Justice
Department officials concluded that successful interdiction
programs required the cooperation of source countries. As a
result, in the fall of 1969, Operation Intercept was transformed
into Operation Cooperation, which in part provided U.S. financial
aid to the Mexican Government to purchase aircraft and to train
agents to interdict the flow of drugs before they reached the
United States borders. </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of
1970 </p>

<p>The year 1970 was an important one in the history of this
Nation's war against drug trafficking and drug abuse. In February
of that year, President Nixon clarified the responsibilities of
the various Federal agencies involved in the effort against drug
trafficking by issuing a directive announcing that BNDD
&quot;controls all investigations involving violations of the
laws of the United States relating to narcotics, marijuana and
dangerous drugs, both within the United States and beyond its
borders. Several months later, the President approved guidelines,
developed by the Attorney General and the Secretary of the
Treasury, which increased the investigatory responsibility of
Customs at ports and borders. However, the most significant event
in 1970 was the enactment of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (1970 Comprehensive Act). </p>

<p>As of 1970, numerous Federal statutes dealt with various
facets of the Nation's drug trafficking and abuse problems. These
laws overlapped, were sometimes inconsistent, and required more
than a dozen Federal agencies to enforce them. In response, the
1970 Comprehensive Act was passed to collect and conform
&quot;diverse laws in one piece of legislation based upon new
scientific information, the restructured Federal law enforcement
efforts under Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1968, and greater
information concerning the scope of the problem.&quot; </p>

<p>The 1970 Act comprised four titles: Title I authorized the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to increase its
efforts in drug rehabilitation, drug treatment and the prevention
of drug abuse. Specifically, Title I authorized the appropriation
of funds for drug abuse prevention and education programs and for
special project grants to programs designed to treat and
rehabilitate narcotic addicts or drug dependent persons. As a
result of these steps, Congress provided for a &quot;greatly
increased Federal effort in the fields of prevention and
rehabilitation&quot; and made the National Institute of Mental
Health the agency primarily responsible for drug education and
prevention activities in the Federal government. </p>

<p>Title II of the 1970 Act, the &quot;Controlled Substances
Act,&quot; along with Title III, comprehensively addressed the
law enforcement aspects of the attack on drug abuse. Among other
things, Title II established five schedules into which controlled
substances were and could be placed, required the registration
of, and record-keeping by, manufacturers, distributors and
dispensers of controlled substances, imposed penalties for
violations of the Act, established a Commission on Marihuana and
Drug Abuse, and authorized BNDD to add 300 agents to its staff
during FY 1971. </p>

<p>Finally, Title III, the Controlled Substances Import and
Export Act, governed the importation and exportation of
controlled substances. The Attorney General was given the
responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the import/export
registration system that the Act created. </p>

<p>Although primarily an effort to consolidate the myriad of laws
dealing with drug trafficking and abuse that had been adopted
over the years, Congress's authority for enacting the 1970 Act
was predicated upon its interstate commerce power and not, as
with previous narcotics laws, on the constitutional power to tax.
This shift had enormous implications for the way that the Federal
government would and did approach drug enforcement in the future:
</p>

<p>[The Controlled Substances Act] set the stage for an
innovation in Federal drug enforcement techniques. That
innovation was assigning large numbers of Federal narcotics
agents to work in local communities. No longer was it necessary
to demonstrate interstate traffic to justify Federal
participation in combating illegal drug use. </p>

<p>Constitutional challenges to the 1970 Act that were predicated
upon the intrastate nature of the conduct prosecuted were
rejected. </p>

<p>Federal Drug Abuse Policy: 1970-1980 </p>

<p>The decade of the 1970's was an extremely significant one for
the development of Federal drug abuse policy in terms of new
laws, organizational and operational reforms, and a growing
recognition that the reduction of the demand for drugs must be
given a greater emphasis. On the debit side the extent of the
Nation's drug abuse problem at the end of 1980 was as great as,
if not greater than, the problem in 1970. To some extent, the
situation in 1980 was attributable to the continuing and
unresolved debate concerning the appropriate Federal role in the
national struggle against drug abuse and trafficking. </p>

<p>New legislative initiatives, organizations, and operational
reforms relating to the Nation's drug abuse problem were adopted
and implemented within a relatively short period after the
enactment of the 1970 Comprehensive Act. One of the most
important and innovative of these reforms was the establishment,
by executive order, of the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse
Prevention (SAODAP) within the Executive Office of the President
on June 17, 1971. The President made the Director of SAODAP his
special representative with respect to all Federal drug abuse
training, education, rehabilitation, research, treatment, and
prevention programs and activities (exclusive of law enforcement
activities and legal proceedings). In this capacity, the SAODAP
Director's duties included prescribing &quot;policies,
guidelines, standards, and criteria for the maximum achievement
of the goals and objectives&quot; of Federal demand reduction
programs and coordinating and evaluating all Federal drug abuse
programs. </p>

<p>President Nixon did not neglect the supply reduction component
of the Federal drug policy. Presidential initiatives in this area
in 1971 included the establishment of the Cabinet Committee on
International Narcotics Control (CCINC) and of the Narcotics
Traffickers Program (NTP) within IRS. The CCINC, chaired by the
Secretary of State, was given the responsibility for
&quot;developing a strategy to check the illegal flow of
narcotics to the United States and coordinating the efforts
undertaken abroad by involved Federal departments and agencies to
implement that strategy.&quot; </p>

<p>The NTP was designed to function as a mechanism for disrupting
drug trafficking by having the IRS intensively investigate
top-echelon drug dealers. The IRS effectively ended the NTP
sometime in 1975, both because it had a relatively low revenue
yield and because IRS officials felt uncomfortable in operating a
program whose primary objective was not tax-related. </p>

<p>On January 28, 1972, President Nixon took another step,
designed to improve the Federal government's drug law enforcement
efforts by establishing an Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement
(ODALE) within the Department of Justice. This office was to be
headed by a Director who would be a Special Assistant Attorney
General and who would serve as a Special Consultant to the
President concerning drug law enforcement. In this role the ODALE
Director was responsible for advising the President on improving
the effectiveness of Federal drug enforcement and on assisting
the States and local governments in strengthening their own drug
law enforcement. The Director was also required to develop and
implement a &quot;concentrated program&quot; for enforcing
Federal laws concerning drug abuse prevention and for cooperating
with State and local governments in the enforcement of their drug
abuse laws. Finally, to ensure that all steps permitted by law
were taken by Federal, State and local governments and by the
private sector to prevent drug abuse, the Director of ODALE was
instructed to consult regularly with the SAODAP Director. With
the establishment of ODALE and SAODAP, and the presidential
instruction that their Directors consult, cooperate, and
coordinate, a mechanism was created within the Federal Government
that, at least theoretically, could have integrated Federal
strategies to reduce drug supply and demand to achieve maximum
results. </p>

<p>That ODALE was created in early 1972, so relatively soon after
the implementation of the 1968 reorganization plan, bespoke a
lack of confidence in the structure and operation of the drug law
enforcement system created by that plan. Indeed, ODALE was
established because of the &quot;Administration's concern that
BNDD and Customs could not act with the swiftness and precision
that a single agency vested with authority and power could.&quot;
In performing its duties and responsibilities ODALE &quot;was
empowered to take the lead in the Administration's 'war on
heroin,' with a particular emphasis on street-level
trafficking.&quot; </p>

<p>Several months after the creation of ODALE, another unit, the
Office of National Narcotic Intelligence (ONNI), was established
within the Department of Justice to function as a Clearinghouse
Of information that would be useful in the Administration's
campaign against drug trafficking. The Director of ONNI was
instructed to collect and provide narcotics intelligence to any
Federal, State, or local official determined to have a
&quot;legitimate official need&quot; for the intelligence. The
ONNI Director was also instructed to cooperate with the Director
of ODALE to assist the latter in insuring that all feasible steps
were taken to prevent drug abuse in the Nation. Although its
mandate did not include the independent development of narcotics
intelligence, the establishment of ONNI was the first concrete
recognition by officials at the highest levels of the Federal
government of the crucial role that intelligence had to play in
supply reduction strategies. </p>

<p>Congress eventually responded positively to President Nixon's
request that it enact legislation confirming his creation of
SAODAP by passing the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972
(1972 Drug Abuse Office Act). This legislation was an important
event in the history of Federal drug abuse policy: </p>

<p>With the enactment of the [Act] Federal policy clearly called
for a balanced response to the problem of drug abuse by adding a
vigorous prevention and treatment component to the existing law
enforcement effort. </p>

<p>Although commitments to the &quot;balanced response&quot;
enshrined in the 1972 Drug Abuse office Act have been proclaimed
repeatedly ever since, they have not generally been translated
into action, as measured by budget authorizations and
expenditures. </p>

<p>Congress was persuaded to enact the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act
because the witnesses who testified before its committees were
&quot;unanimously agreed that drug abuse in America had reached
epidemic proportions.&quot; Most of the witnesses were
&quot;generally agreed that greater emphasis on the so-called
demand side of the problem is required, that is, on treatment,
rehabilitation, research, education and training.&quot; Congress
also found that the Federal government's activities with respect
to the &quot;demand side of the drug abuse field have been
carried on by at least nine different agencies and
departments&quot; and that the legislation under consideration
was needed to &quot;provide for and insure a central
comprehensive coordination of the federal effort.&quot; In
passing the Act, Congress concluded that the &quot;emphasis must,
indeed, be changed [to strategies to reduce demand] if there is
to be meaningful progress in the effort against drug abuse.&quot;
</p>

<p>The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act did many things, including
establishing SAODAP in the Executive Office of the President;
making the Director of SAODAP responsible for, among other
things, providing overall planning and policy, and establishing
objectives and priorities, for all federal drug abuse prevention
functions, making recommendations to the President concerning any
Federal drug traffic prevention function, making findings and
recommendations to the President concerning the resolution of
conflicts involving drug abuse prevention or drug traffic
prevention functions, and coordinating Federal drug abuse
prevention functions with those of the State and local
governments; directing the President to require development of a
comprehensive, coordinated long-term Federal strategy for all
drug abuse and drug traffic prevention functions; directing the
Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to
States submitting plans for establishing, conducting and
coordinating projects for the development of more effective drug
abuse prevention functions and to make special project grants to,
and contracts with, public and private entities and individuals
to develop drug abuse prevention programs; and establishing a
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to administer the
programs of the Secretary of HEW relating to drug abuse
prevention functions. </p>

<p>The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act was necessary and useful
legislation, but it was based on the mistaken premise that the
nation's drug abuse problem could be dealt with in a relatively
short period of time: </p>

<p>[I]t is the policy of the United States and the purpose of
this Act to focus the comprehensive resources of the Federal
Government and bring them to bear on drug abuse with the
immediate objective of significantly reducing the incidence of
drug abuse in the United States within the shortest possible
period of time . . . . </p>

<p>Consistent with this premise, Congress provided that SAODAP
was to be abolished on June 30, 1975. </p>

<p>There appears to have been an expectation at the time that the
1972 Drug Abuse office Act became effective that NIDA would
assume many of the programmatic functions of SAODAP on or before
June 30, 1975, after the war against drug abuse had been won and
only &quot;mopping-up&quot; operations remained. This expectation
no doubt was encouraged by statements made subsequent to the
passage of the 1972 Act, such as that of President Nixon in
September of 1973 that &quot;[w]e have turned the corner on drug
addiction in the United States.&quot; As the historical record
demonstrates, the expectation of quick success was unrealistic
because of the nature of the drug problem. </p>

<p>The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act reflected the realization that
an exclusive reliance on strategies to reduce supply will fail to
achieve the ultimate objective. Such an approach disregards the
fundamental economic principle, that where a demand for a service
or commodity exists, some entrepreneur, for the right price, will
attempt to supply it. There is an optimal mix of approaches to
reduce demand and supply that will obtain maximum results and
thus achieve the goal of that policy, i.e., the elimination of
drug abuse. The Federal government necessarily has a paramount
and continuing role in that policy, in terms of providing
leadership, resources, and support to the other participants.
Experience immediately following the enactment of the 1972 Drug
Abuse Office Act demonstrates that although the Nation's drug
abuse problem may never be eliminated, it can be reduced
substantially if a long-term commitment of sufficient resources
is made and unreasonable impatience for results is checked. </p>

<p>Despite the comprehensive restructuring of the Federal
narcotics laws that had occurred in 1970, related legislative
initiatives, and the innovations in Federal drug law enforcement
represented by ODALE and ONNI, the Nixon Administration concluded
that Federal drug law enforcement continued to be hampered by
interagency rivalries and jurisdictional overlaps and disputes.
In response, another major restructuring of the Federal drug law
enforcement machinery was announced on March 28, 1973. The Nixon
Administration trumpeted the 1973 reorganization plan, which was
implemented on July 1, 1973, as doing for the supply side of the
drug abuse problem what the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act had done
for the demand side: create an organization with the necessary
resources, breadth, and leadership capacity to act decisively. </p>

<p>The Federal drug law enforcement structure in March of 1973
was complex, as reflected in Appendix C, with no single
individual or agency responsible for supervision of the overall
effort. The 1973 reorganization plan was designed to overcome
perceived deficiencies in existing law enforcement. </p>

<p>The 1973 reorganization plan was motivated primarily by the
beliefs of Administration officials that the aggregation of
Federal drug law enforcement activities had &quot;serious
operational and organizational shortcomings&quot; and that
&quot;enforcement work could benefit significantly . . . from
consolidation of our anti-drug forces under a single unified
command.&quot; The most important innovation adopted by the plan
was the creation of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
within the Department of Justice as the &quot;single,
comprehensive Federal agency within the Department of Justice to
lead the war against illicit drug traffic.&quot; The DEA, to be
headed by an Administrator who would report directly to the
Attorney General, was to be responsible for the anti-drug
functions, and would absorb the associated manpower and budgets
of BNDD, ODALE, and ONNI and those of the Bureau of Customs with
respect to drug investigations and intelligence. The plan also
provided that drug law enforcement research that had been
hitherto funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration
would be transferred to DEA. </p>

<p>While the 1973 reorganization plan reaffirmed the jurisdiction
of the Bureau of Customs to conduct investigative, intelligence,
and law enforcement functions relating to the suppression of drug
trafficking at ports of entry and borders, it prohibited Customs
from exercising those functions, as it had been previously
authorized to do, at locations away from ports of entry or
borders. In addition, drugs, evidence, and persons seized by
customs agents at ports of entry or borders were to be turned
over to representatives of the Attorney General. The plan
explicitly provided that the Department of Justice, in addition
to Customs, could perform law enforcement functions, including
those relating to illicit drug trafficking, at the Nation's ports
of entry and borders. Finally, the plan required the Attorney
General to assure the maximum cooperation between and among DEA,
the FBI, and other units of the Justice Department to achieve
coordination of all of his drug law enforcement functions. </p>

<p>Once established, DEA played an &quot;increasingly crucial
role in the coordination of Federal drug law enforcement; and
during the 1970's a number of interagency efforts were
launched.&quot; Among the coordination efforts undertaken by DEA
was the development of mechanisms to provide timely and accurate
narcotics intelligence to drug law enforcement personnel at the
Federal, State and local levels. Steps taken by DEA in this area
included the establishment of: </p>

<p>(1) An Office of Intelligence at DEA headquarters which,
organizationally, was at the same level as its Office of
Enforcement; </p>

<p>(2) Regional Intelligence Units (RIUs) in each of the DEA
regions; </p>

<p>(3) The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) in 1974 as a border
intelligence unit, which soon grew into a
&quot;twenty-four-hour-a-day intelligence center, with worldwide
capabilities to collect, process, and disseminate information
concerning illicit drug trafficking as the smuggling of aliens
and weapons; EPIC is staffed by personnel from DFA, INS, Customs,
the Coast Guard, BATF, FAA, the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI and
IRS; </p>

<p>(4) The Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System
(NADDIS) and the System to Retrieve Information from Drug
Evidence (STRIDE) to provide access to numerous investigative
records of PEA and other Federal, State and local drug
enforcement records; </p>

<p>(5) In April of 1978, the National Narcotics Intelligence
Consumers Committee (NNICC), chaired by the DEA Deputy Assistant
Administrator for Intelligence and including representatives from
the Departments of Defense, Treasury and State, and their
component agencies in the field, including Customs, the Coast
Guard, FBI, INS, IRS, and NIDA to coordinate the collection,
analysis, dissemination and evaluation of drug-related
intelligence, both foreign and domestic, and to publish annually
a &quot;National Intelligence Estimate on the Supply of Drugs to
the U.S. Illicit Market from Foreign and Domestic Sources.&quot; </p>

<p>In addition to trying to improve the intelligence gathering
and dissemination functions of Federal drug law enforcement, PEA
attempted to improve the task force concept in drug law
enforcement which it had inherited from ODALE. In 1974 DEA
adopted the Central Tactical Units (CENTAC) program to focus
enforcement resources on conspiracy investigations of high-level
drug trafficking targets. Unfettered by normal DEA regional
operations, centrally administered, specially funded, staffed by
personnel from DEA, IRS, Customs, and State and local agencies,
and charged with pursuing conspiracy cases under the Continuing
Criminal Enterprise (CCE) and RICO statutes, the CENTAC program
did produce relatively high arrest and conviction rates of high
level traffickers, and accounted for 12 percent of DEA arrests
from 1976 to 1979 while using less than three percent of DEA
personnel. Although criticizing the CENTAC Program for not
exploiting the Federal forfeiture statutes to seize the assets of
convicted traffickers, the General Accounting office (GAO)
nevertheless concluded that: </p>

<p>Given the success of the Central Tactical units and the need
for more multi-regional conspiracy investigations, the expansion
of the [CENTAC] program is warranted. </p>

<p>GAO recommended expansion of the CENTAC program despite an
earlier conclusion that the CENTAC efforts had not
&quot;achieve[d] the overall objective - complete immobilization
of the targeted trafficking organizations.&quot; The 1980 GAO
report also conflicted with: </p>

<p>DEA officials who said the current size of the CENTAC program
is optimum given existing enforcement resources, required
commitments, and their preference for regionally controlled
investigations . . . . </p>

<p>Another effort at interagency operational cooperation during
the decade of the 1970's was the creation of three FBI-DEA forces
in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles to &quot;test the
feasibility of joint operations.&quot; These task forces were
designed to combine the FBI's organized crime and conspiracy
cases expertise with DEA's experience in narcotics
investigations. This effort was probably doomed from the start
because, although each agency was supposed to coordinate with the
other, each used its own investigative techniques, personnel, and
information sources and each maintained jurisdictional autonomy.
After two years, the program was in effect disbanded, and
evaluations by GAO and others attributed the failure to
disagreements over investigative techniques and to restrictions
on case selection. </p>

<p>The creation of DEA by the 1973 reorganization plan and DEA's
subsequent development of new supply reduction approaches were
not the only steps undertaken and designed during the 1970's to
respond to what many had come to view as the almost intractable
national drug problem. For example, Congress passed the Narcotic
Addict Treatment Act of 1974, which amended the 1970 Controlled
Substances Act to require annual registration by practitioners
dispensing narcotic drugs, including methadone, for maintenance
or detoxification purposes. This legislation, which imposed
standards for the legal dispensing of drugs, was deemed necessary
because of the increased diversion of methadone for illegal sale
and use. </p>

<p>That year also saw the passage of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Education Act Amendments of 1974, which extended the grant and
contract authorities of the Drug Abuse Education Act of 1970 for
three years and authorized the expenditure of $90 million over
those three years. The Act placed greater emphasis on the need
for prevention and early intervention programs, recognizing the
crucial role of family, peer group, school, church and other
community institutions in influencing young people's behavior. </p>

<p>In enacting the 1974 Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education Act
Amendments, Congress noted that most of the previously adopted
Federal programs to reduce demand had &quot;inevitably been
directed primarily toward the person who is already in serious
trouble with alcohol and/or drugs,&quot; but that the focus of
the Drug Abuse Education Act of 1970 had been different in that
it was directed to those who had not yet experimented with drugs
or to those who had just begun to do so. In passing the 1974
amendments Congress applauded the focus on prevention,
reaffirming the philosophy that had suffused the 1970 Education
Act: </p>

<p>[R]eal progress in the struggle against alcohol and drug abuse
will require an intensified effort to reach that far more
numerous group, those millions of young people who may be tempted
to experiment with dangerous drugs or who may have already done
so. </p>

<p>Although committed to the continuation of Federal support for
local drug education programs, Congress was nevertheless critical
of those educational programs that were based upon information
that was incomplete, erroneous, or designed to frighten, and
those based on accurate information that had the tendency to
arouse interest in drugs and to lead to experimentation, Before
passing the 1974 Amendments Congress received assurances from the
Office of Education within the Department of HEW that it would
make every effort to support only those programs which would
&quot;incorporate factual material about drugs into programs
which focus on the causes of drug use and emphasize the
development of appropriate attitudes and values,&quot; rather
than merely inform and arouse interest. </p>

<p>The Nixon Administration opposed passage of the bill that
eventually became the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education Act
Amendments of 1974 because it believed that &quot;alcohol and
drug abuse education [should] be included among the special
projects to be funded under other education legislation and that
alcoholism and drug abuse formula grant funds to the states
[should] be considered the major source of funds for local
alcohol and drug abuse education programs.&quot; Congress
disagreed with the Administration's position concerning
categorical legislation relating to prevention and early
intervention educational programs, stating that: </p>

<p>Failure to renew a clear legislative mandate to the Office of
Education would destroy the identity of the program at both the
Federal and the State level and would cast the alcohol and drug
education programs in the role of supplicants to those agencies
whose primary concern is not education and who are already
besieged by the demands of treatment programs. </p>

<p>The ultimate result would be either the disappearance of
community drug and alcohol education programs or a reversion to
some of the futile and dangerous efforts of the past. . . </p>

<p>As noted earlier, the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act provided that
SAODAP would be abolished on June 30, 1975, with no assignment of
its policy-making and coordinative functions to any other Federal
agency. On March 19, 1976, however, legislation was approved that
in effect continued SAODAP, but under the slightly different name
of &quot;Office of Drug Abuse Policy&quot; (ODAP). Congress
created ODAP because: </p>

<p>[T]here is current evidence that whatever improvement in the
problem occurred in 1973 was temporary and that the present
problem is at least as great as at the time the original act was
passed. </p>

<p>In approving the continuation of an executive level drug
advisor, Congress found that &quot;drug abuse was not a crisis
which could be rapidly solved but rather a continuing problem
calling for a continued Federal responsibility.&quot; Congress
also concluded that Federal expenditures for drug abuse
prevention efforts had peaked in 1974 and then declined, despite
continuing serious problems, due to, among other things, the
anticipated end of SAODAP: </p>

<p>It would also appear that the existence of a high-level office
in the executive branch is to some extent correlated with the
fiscal emphasis provided to drug abuse prevention efforts. </p>

<p>Congress was also somewhat concerned that &quot;unless some
active direction is taken at some high level it is probable that
in the very near future funding for drug law enforcement will
again overbalance funding for drug abuse prevention.&quot; </p>

<p>In creating ODAP Congress required its Director to make
recommendations to the President regarding the policies and
priorities for, and objectives of, all Federal &quot;drug abuse
functions,&quot; a term which was defined to encompass both drug
abuse prevention and drug traffic prevention functions, and to
coordinate the performance of such functions by Federal
departments and agencies. This was a significant expansion of the
authority of ODAP's predecessor, SAODAP. </p>

<p>Despite the Ford Administration's opposition to the
continuation of an executive-level office relating to drug abuse
prevention, President Ford did not veto the 1976 amendment
creating ODAP. However, President Ford did not staff ODAP, even
though a specific line-item authorization had been made for it.
DAP did not come into being until President Carter issued a
memorandum initiating the Office on March 14, 1977. Less than two
months after the Senate confirmation of the ODAP Director,
President Carter submitted a reorganization plan restructuring
the Executive Office of the President to Congress on July 15,
1977. </p>

<p>The 1977 reorganization plan altered the structure of the
Executive Office of the President, which at the time consisted of
the immediate White House Office, the Vice President's Office,
OMB, and 14 other agencies, including ODAP and the Domestic
Council. As proposed, the plan, among other things, abolished the
Domestic Council and ODAP and redesignated the Domestic Council
Staff as the Domestic Policy Staff. The functions of ODAP and its
Director would be transferred to the President who could then
delegate such functions. </p>

<p>Several members of Congress, recalling that it was the need
for a high-level policy and coordinating office to oversee the
activities of more than 20 Federal agencies with significant drug
abuse responsibilities that had given birth to the SAODAP/ODAP
program, expressed grave concern about the abolishment of ODAP.
President Carter assured them that the ODAP's functions would be
carried on within the Executive office of the President and that
the Domestic Policy Staff, with several of its staff members
assigned exclusively to drug abuse issues, would handle ODAP's
policy-making and coordinative functions. With Congressional
acquiescence, the 1977 Reorganization became effective on March
26, 1978, at which time a core group of ODAP staff was
transferred to the Domestic Policy Staff. </p>

<p>Although Congress did not block the provisions of the 1977
reorganization plan, members of Congress nevertheless remained
unsure whether drug abuse policy-making and coordinative
functions could be or would be adequately performed by the
Domestic Policy Staff. This uncertainty was reflected in the Drug
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Amendments of 1978, which extended
the authorization for NIDA programs for only one year, instead of
the previous multi-year reauthorizations, so that it could
evaluate the system created by the 1977 reorganization plan after
a relatively brief but adequate period of time. </p>

<p>The Congressional evaluation of the operations of the drug
abuse policy and coordinating system in the Executive Office of
the President was embodied the next year in the Drug Abuse
Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Amendments of 1979.
During the consideration of this legislation, President Carter
assigned the Associate Director for Drug Policy of the Domestic
Policy Staff the responsibility for assisting the President in
performing the functions of ODAP, which had been transferred to
the President by the 1977 reorganization plan. President Carter
took this step because of Congressional concern that: </p>

<p>[T]he continued coordination of drug abuse policy, required by
the 1972 Act and its subsequent amendments, became dependent upon
the continued interest . . . of the President and other
individuals within the Executive Branch, rather than being
clearly structured by statute as had been the case prior to the
implementation of the Reorganization Plan. </p>

<p>Because of the steps taken by the Carter Administration
including the revitalization of the Strategy Council, Congress
responded by legislating what the 1977 reorganization plan had
done. </p>

<p>In addition to giving its imprimatur to the 1977
reorganization plan, the 1979 legislation made authorizations for
NIDA's state formula grants and special grant and contract
programs for drug education and prevention through September 30,
1981. It did so because it found that the &quot;growing extent of
drug abuse indicates an urgent need for prevention and
intervention programs designed to reach the general
population.&quot; In providing for a two-year reauthorization for
NIDA programs and activities, Congress rejected the Carter
Administration's proposal that state formula grants for drug
abuse be consolidated with those for alcoholism and mental health
because: </p>

<p>There is considerable history to suggest that earmarked
funding for categorical programs should remain separate at the
State level as well as at the national level. Within the
traditional health care delivery system, the drug and alcohol
client has not fared well. To force these systems to compete
again is to seriously jeopardize the major strides which have
been made . . . . The Committee insists that a categorical
emphasis on drug abuse must be maintained at all levels of
government. A loss of direct program emphasis would severely harm
the state focus on combatting drug abuse, and could seriously
endanger the Nation's battle against drug abuse. </p>

<p>The decade of the 1970's was an important one in the evolution
of the Federal drug abuse effort. It began with a comprehensive
restructuring of Federal laws relating to drugs and included a
major reorganization of Federal drug law enforcement agencies in
a effort to reduce interagency rivalries and to promote
efficiency and leadership in the fight against drug trafficking.
Equally important was the recognition that strategies to reduce
demand must be an essential component of the overall drug abuse
policy and that the nation's drug abuse problem could not be
regarded as a crisis susceptible to quick resolution. In
addition, new laws were passed to respond to particular aspects
of the drug problem, and new enforcement approaches were tried in
an effort to disrupt drug trafficking more effectively. </p>

<p>On a less positive note, disagreements over certain
fundamental issues remained unresolved at the end of the 1970's.
Among these were the role of the Federal Government in drug
policy and the appropriate balance between strategies to reduce
demand and supply. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, despite
legislation, massive reorganizations, new enforcement techniques,
and necessary attitudinal changes, the problems of drug abuse and
trafficking continued at high levels at the end of the decade. </p>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter IV </h2>

<h2>Part 2: Federal Drug Abuse Policy: 1981-Present </h2>

<p>Early in his administration President Ronald Reagan
acknowledged that drug abuse was &quot;one of the gravest
problems facing us&quot; as a Nation. The Reagan Administration
has taken many steps designed to improve the effectiveness of the
U.S. overall drug abuse policy. </p>

<p>Reorganization/Coordination </p>

<p>On January 21, 1982, in a major policy shift, the FBI was
given concurrent jurisdiction with DEA for drug law enforcement
and investigation. In addition, the Administrator of DEA was
required to report to the Director of the FBI who was given the
responsibility for supervising generally drug law enforcement
efforts and policies. </p>

<p>In giving the FBI concurrent jurisdiction for enforcement of
U.S. drug laws, the Attorney General followed the recommendation
of a committee that he had established to study the need for
increased coordination of DEA and the FBI in the drug field. This
committee was headed by then Associate Attorney General Rudolph
W. Giuliani. According to Giuliani, the Attorney General's
committee recommended concurrent jurisdiction because: </p>

<p>[W]e believe we can more effectively deal with the large-scale
trafficking groups by coordinating DEA's street-level, undercover
expertise with the FBI's ability to combat large criminal
enterprises. The FBI's 20-year experience in combatting organized
crime will also prove critical to drug enforcement. </p>

<p>Although FBI expertise in organized crime and financial
investigations would be available in drug enforcement work as a
result of concurrent jurisdiction, DEA would continue to function
as a &quot;single-mission narcotics enforcement agency&quot; that
would &quot;give the drug problem the kind of focus it
needs.&quot; </p>

<p>In another action relating to the coordination of Federal drug
abuse efforts, President Reagan issued an executive order on June
24, 1982, directing the office of Policy Development to assist
the President in performing his duties under the Drug Abuse
Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act; designating the
Director of the Drug Abuse Policy Office within the Office of
Policy Development as primarily responsible for coordinating,
overseeing, and policy-making for all Executive international and
domestic drug abuse functions; and making the Director directly
responsible for the activities of a drug policy staff within the
office of Policy Development. </p>

<p>Despite President Reagan's stated commitment to the
performance of the functions imposed upon him by the Drug Abuse
Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act, Congress became
increasingly dissatisfied with a perceived lack of coordination
of such functions. This dissatisfaction became embodied in an
Omnibus Crime Bill (H.R. 3963) which included a provision to
establish an Office of Director of National and International
Drug Operations and Policy, which was described as follows: </p>

<p>Similar in concept to SAODAP, the proposed agency would have
been charged with the overall planning and coordination of
Federal efforts to control the supply of dangerous drugs. </p>

<p>Unlike SAODAP, which had been directed by Congress to
coordinate Federal drug abuse prevention efforts, and unlike
ODAP, which was enjoined to oversee all Federal drug abuse
programs, the proposed Office of Director of National and
International Drug Operations and Policy was envisioned as a
mechanism for coordinating and directing Federal law enforcement
operations. </p>

<p>While the President was considering the merits of H.R. 3963,
an Administration spokesman criticized that portion of the bill
creating the Office of Director of National and International
Drug Operations and Policy: </p>

<p>If the czar . . . is to have the power to direct the drug
enforcement operations of other Cabinet officers, the very nature
of our Cabinet system of government would be drastically altered.
If he is not to have such power, he could do little more than
interfere with the existing mechanisms, which have been working
well. </p>

<p>Two days after this statement appeared, President Reagan
pocket-vetoed H.R. 3963 and issued a memorandum of disapproval
explaining his action: </p>

<p>The creation of another layer of bureaucracy within the
Executive Branch would produce friction, disrupt effective law
enforcement, and could threaten the integrity of criminal
investigations and prosecutions . . . . </p>

<p>The seriousness of this threat is underscored by the
overwhelming opposition to this provision by the Federal law
enforcement community as well as by such groups as the
International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National
Association of Attorney's General. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>The war on crime and drugs does not need more bureaucracy in
Washington. It does need more action in the field, and that is
where my Administration will focus its efforts. </p>

<p>Members of Congress were not easily dissuaded from their
efforts to achieve a greater degree of coordination of the
Federal drug abuse efforts. On February 7, 1984, the Senate
passed a proposed National Narcotics Act of 1984 (S. 1787),
which, among other things, would have established a cabinet-level
office of National and International Drug Operation and Policy.
Under the bill the Director of the Office was authorized to:
develop, review, implement, and enforce U.S. policy concerning
illegal drugs; coordinate all U.S. efforts to halt drug
trafficking into and within the United States; develop, in
concert with the Federal entities concerned with drug control,
budgetary priorities and allocations; and coordinate the
collection and disseminate of narcotics intelligence. </p>

<p>In recommending that S. 1787 be passed, the Senate Judiciary
Committee acknowledged that the Reagan Administration had
undertaken a number of &quot;promising initiatives&quot; in drug
law enforcement. However, the Committee concluded that an Office
of National and International Drug Operations and Policy was
necessary because: </p>

<p>[T]he Committee believes the Administration's anti-drug effort
falls short in one crucial respect: the lack of central
direction. </p>

<p>At least 15 Federal agencies play a role in the regulation of
commerce in dangerous drugs or in the enforcement of other
restrictions . . . . These agencies are located in six different
departments. Under such circumstances, it is inevitable that
divergences as to priorities will arise and that there will be
conflicting interpretations of national policy. Indeed, national
policy in such an area as drug law enforcement must be
continually reevaluated and reformulated; a one-time annual
review and the publication of a broadly-worded strategy does not
suffice. </p>

<p>The Committee also described in some detail the role it
envisioned for the proposed Office: </p>

<p>SOADAP was the same kind of &quot;overlord&quot; agency as the
one contemplated by S. 1787. However, it was flawed from the
beginning in that its effective jurisdiction was limited to
activities aimed at the control of drug demand; it was not given
authority of any substance in the law enforcement field. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>The Committee bill draws from the SAODAP concept, but focuses
on the aspects of drug control that were excluded from the former
agency's purview, i.e., the government's efforts to control the
supply of abused drugs. It is in the area of supply control, be
it in foreign or domestic programs, that the Committee perceives
the greatest current need for central direction. </p>

<p>In recommending the establishment of an office to which the
Reagan Administration appeared to be implacably opposed, the
Senate Judiciary Committee took pains to observe that the
Director of the Drug Abuse Policy office was not capable of
performing the necessary coordinative functions concerning
Federal drug law enforcement efforts: </p>

<p>[U]nder questioning by several Congressmen [of the House
Subcommittee on Crime at a February 17, 1983, hearing on the
coordination of drug enforcement efforts] it became clear that
the director does not have the authority or stature to oversee
the implementation of the Federal strategy. </p>

<p>Anxious to reassure the Administration about the proposed
cabinet-level Office, the Committee made it clear that, in
implementing the legislation, the President would have a great
deal of flexibility; for example, the Office would not have to be
established in the Executive office of the President, and the
Attorney General could be appointed the Director of the central
drug agency. However, the Committee was insistent that the
Director have something like a cabinet-level status because such
status was deemed &quot;necessary if the office is to have the
influence needed to impose a truce on interagency feuding, to
insure maximum participation, and to allocate budgetary resources
for top efficiency and economy.&quot; </p>

<p>Despite the Administration's opposition, the Senate passed S.
1787. However, Congressional conferees compromised and
substituted a National Drug Enforcement Policy Board for the
Office of National and International Drug Operations and Policy
as the means for achieving greater coordination of Federal drug
law enforcement efforts. Both the House and Senate agreed to the
Conference Report, and Public Law No. 98-473 was thereafter
approved on October 12, 1984. Title II of this law was entitled
the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, and Chapter XIII of
that title was designated the National Narcotics Act of 1984. </p>

<p>Congress established the National Drug Enforcement Policy
Board (Policy Board) because it found that drug trafficking was
estimated to be an $80 billion a year industry; only 5 to 15
percent of the drugs imported into the country were interdicted;
and controlling the supply of drugs was thought to be a key to
reducing the drug-related crime epidemic. The Policy Board,
chaired by the Attorney General, was and is charged with
facilitating coordination of U.S. operations and policy
concerning illegal law enforcement. As Chairman of the Policy
Board, the Attorney General was given many duties, including
advising the Policy Board concerning drug law enforcement and
acting as primary advisor to the President and Congress on
Board-developed programs. The Act, however, declares that nothing
therein authorizes the Board or its Chairman to interfere with
routine law enforcement or intelligence decisions of any agency.
Finally, the National Narcotics Act of 1984 amended the Drug
Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act to declare
that one of the duties of the White House Office of Drug Abuse
Policy Board was to insure coordination between the Policy Board
and health issues associated with drug abuse. </p>

<p>The creation of the Policy Board in January 1985 represents
only the latest compromise between the President and Congress in
the ongoing search for more effective coordination of all facets
of the Federal drug abuse effort. It remains to be seen whether
an entity like the Policy Board can effectively oversee, police,
and coordinate all Federal law enforcement efforts and whether
some other mechanism is needed to impose coordination of Federal
demand reduction and supply reduction strategies. </p>

<p>Legislative Responses to the Drug Problem </p>

<p>In addition to the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984,
other important legislative initiatives have been adopted in
recent years. For example, the Department of Defense
Authorization Act of 1982 contained a provision, &quot;Military
Cooperation With Civilian Law Enforcement Officials,&quot; which
was intended to codify the practices of cooperation that had
developed between military and civilian law enforcement
authorities. The Act was also designed to improve the level of
cooperation by delineating precisely that assistance which
military commanders could provide and by permitting military
personnel to operate military equipment that had been lent to
civilian drug enforcement agencies. This legislation was deemed
necessary for the following reasons: </p>

<p>The rising tide of drugs being smuggled into the United States
by land, sea, and air presents a grave threat to all Americans. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>Only through the dedicated work of all of Federal, State, and
local law enforcement agencies can we begin to stem this tide. In
fighting this battle, it is important to maximize the degree of
cooperation between the military and civilian law enforcement. At
the same time, we must recognize the need to maintain the
traditional balance of authority between civilians and the
military. </p>

<p>The most important and innovative part of the legislation was
Section 374, which permits the Secretary of Defense to assign
Department personnel to operate and maintain military equipment
that had been made available to an agency with jurisdiction to
enforce the Controlled Substances Act. This relatively simple
change increased geometrically the potential interdiction
capability of Federal drug law enforcement agencies. </p>

<p>The year 1984 was a prolific one for legislation dealing with
discrete areas in drug law enforcement. The Controlled Substance
Registrant Protection Act of 1984 made it illegal, among other
things, to steal any quantity of a controlled substance from a
registrant. Congress also directed the Attorney General,
notwithstanding the scheduling provisions of the Controlled
Substances Act, to transfer methaqualone, commonly known by the
brand name Quaalude, from Schedule II to Schedule I, with the
effect of making the prescription of methaqualone unlawful
because it no longer had an approved medical use. While remaining
committed to the proposition that scheduling of controlled
substances ordinarily should be handled in accordance with the
administrative procedures mandated by the Controlled Substances
Act, Congress took this legislative action after determining that
circumstances required it to do so and that the adverse effects
of the diversion of methaqualone outweighed its therapeutic
usefulness. </p>

<p>Congress also passed the Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control
Act, which amended the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, to, among
other things, require the Administrator of the FAA to revoke
airman certificates and aircraft registrations of those convicted
of violating any Federal or State law relating to controlled
substances, except where the violations involved possession
offenses. The Act also made it illegal for any person to serve as
an airman without an airman's certificate in connection with a
transportation that constitutes a Federal or State drug felony
offense. </p>

<p>Although the Controlled Substance Registrant Protection Act of
1984, the Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control Act, and the
Congressional rescheduling of methaqualone were necessary laws,
by far the most important drug law enforcement measures passed in
1984 were contained in several provisions of the Comprehensive
Crime Control Act of 1984. The Act included: </p>

<p>(i) Bail Reform Act of 1984: This Act comprises many sections,
but the most important and most controversial was that codified
in 18 U.S.C. Section 3142. Section 3142 provides that when a
person charged with an offense appears before a judicial officer,
the judicial officer must order that, pending trial, the accused
be released on personal recognizance or upon execution of an
unsecured appearance bond; released upon certain listed
conditions; temporarily detained to permit exclusion or
deportation if not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident;
temporarily detained to permit revocation of a prior conditional
release; or detained. The preventive detention provision states
that the judicial officer must hold a hearing in any case
involving a narcotics offense for which imprisonment for ten or
more years is prescribed to determine whether any conditions will
assure the accused's appearance and the safety of any other
person and of the community. In any such hearing the accused must
prove that there are conditions that will assure his appearance
or the community's safety, if the judicial officer finds that
there is probable cause to believe that the person committed the
offense. </p>

<p>(ii) Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984: This legislation
made extensive revisions to Federal civil and criminal forfeiture
laws and procedures, which had targeted the assets of
racketeering and drug trafficking organizations: </p>

<p>Today few in the Congress or the law enforcement community
fail to recognize that the traditional criminal sanctions of fine
and imprisonment are inadequate to deter or punish the enormously
profitable trade in dangerous drugs . . . . Clearly, if law
enforcement efforts to combat racketeering and drug trafficking
are to be successful, they must include an attack on the economic
aspects of these crimes. Forfeiture is the mechanism through
which such an attack may be made. </p>

<p>This 1984 legislation was designed to eliminate limitations
and ambiguities that had &quot;significantly impeded the full
realization of forfeiture's potential as a powerful law
enforcement weapon.&quot; </p>

<p>With respect to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, the 1984 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act did
several things, including confirming the Supreme Court's decision
in Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16(1983) that a
defendant's ill-gotten profits from racketeering were
forfeitable; defining the property subject to forfeiture to
include real property; making the relation back doctrine, i.e.,
U.S. interest in forfeitable property arises at the time of the
commission of the act that gives rise to the forfeiture,
applicable in criminal forfeiture proceedings; and expanding
post-indictment prior restraining order authority to preserve the
availability of forfeiture assets by making an indictment
sufficient to establish conclusively probable cause that the
property will be forfeited. </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Forfeiture Act also amended the 1970
Comprehensive Act. With respect to criminal forfeiture, the 1984
Act added a new provision to the 1970 act that is applicable to
all felony drug offenses, including the Continuing Criminal
Enterprise offense. In virtually all respects, the drug criminal
forfeiture provisions are now identical to those of the amended
RICO statute. The new drug criminal forfeiture provision also
creates a rebuttable presumption that any property of a person
convicted of a drug felony is subject to forfeiture if the
government establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that
the defendant acquired the property during the period of
violation, or within a reasonably short period thereafter, and
there was no likely source for the property other than the
violation. </p>

<p>(iii) Controlled Substances Penalties Amendments Act of 1984.
This legislation generally enhanced the penalties for violations
of the Controlled Substances Act. Specifically, it provided a
20-year prison term and a $250,000 fine for violations involving
specified large amounts of Schedule I and II narcotic drugs, PCP
and LSD; raised the fine for violations involving all Schedule I
or II substances and enhanced the fines for violations involving
Schedule III, IV, and V substances. With respect to all doubling
provisions for recidivists in the Controlled Substances Act, the
1984 legislation removed an ambiguity in the existing law by
providing that a State drug felony conviction would trigger the
provisions; it went further by providing that a Foreign drug
felony conviction would have the same effect. Finally, the 1984
legislation provided that anyone who distributed controlled
substances on or within 1,000 feet of school property could be
subjected to a prison term or fine or both up to twice what is
otherwise provided. </p>

<p>(iv) Dangerous Drug Diversion Control Act of 1984. This
legislation &quot;represent[ed] the first major updating of the
regulatory provisions of the Controlled Substances Act and the
Controlled Substances Import and Export Act since their enactment
in 1970.&quot; In doing so, the 1984 amendments focused
principally on diversion of drugs of legitimate origin into the
illicit market and the manufacture and abuse of new drugs, such
as controlled substance analogs. With respect to the problem of
diversion, which Congress had attempted to address in the 1970
Comprehensive Act by creating a closed system, the legislative
history states: </p>

<p>Diversion of legally produced drugs into illicit channels is a
major part of the drug abuse problem in the United States. It is
estimated that between 60 and 70 percent of all drug-related
deaths and injuries involve drugs that were originally part of
the legitimate drug production and distribution chain. Also,
diversion of legally produced drugs often evidences the same sort
of large-scale trafficking more commonly associated with the
trade in wholly illicit drugs. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>Unfortunately, experience under the [CSA] over the past decade
has demonstrated that the strong regulatory authority to maintain
a &quot;closed&quot; distribution chain does not exist at the
practitioner level. Yet, it is estimated that 80 to 90 percent of
all current diversion occurs at this level. </p>

<p>In response to this diversion problem, Congress amended the
Controlled Substances Act to, among other things, permit the
Attorney General to deny registration to practitioners if such
registration would be inconsistent with the public interest,
authorize the Attorney General to suspend or revoke a
registration upon the recommendation of a competent state
authority or if the public interest requires it; and authorize
the Attorney General to make grants to State and local
governments in connection with those governments' anti-diversion
programs. </p>

<p>With respect to the problem of the manufacture and abuse of
new drugs, Congress found that: </p>

<p>[T]he procedural requirements for controlling a drug under 21
U.S.C. 811 have proven sufficiently time consuming that they
preclude a swift response when an as yet uncontrolled drug
rapidly enters the illicit market and creates a significant
health problem. </p>

<p>As a result of the Dangerous Drug Diversion Control Act of
1984, Congress gave the Attorney General emergency scheduling
authority. Under that authority, the Attorney General is
permitted to schedule a drug in Schedule I on a temporary basis,
for up to one year, if he determines that such action is
&quot;necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public
safety.&quot; In making this determination, the Attorney General
need only consider the history and current pattern of abuse, the
scope, duration, and significance of abuse, and the nature of the
risk, if any, to the public health. The temporary scheduling may
be extended for up to six months while a rule-making proceeding
is conducted for the purpose of permanently scheduling the drug.
Such a temporary scheduling order is not subject to judicial
review. </p>

<p>(v) Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act
Amendments: &quot;Without the means to launder money, thereby
making cash generated by a criminal enterprise appear to come
from a legitimate source, organized crime could not flourish as
it now does.&quot; The 1984 amendments of the Currency and
Foreign Transactions Reporting Act were designed to &quot;fine
tune the [then] current currency reporting law.&quot; One of the
changes adopted increased the civil penalty for violating the
records and reporting requirements of the Act from $1,000 to
$10,000 for each violation and the criminal penalty from $1,000
and 1 year in prison to $250,000 and 5 years imprisonment. These
changes were deemed necessary because: </p>

<p>[I]t is important to recognize that [the requirements] are
primarily directed at persons who make a lucrative career in the
illicit drug trade and organized crime. As such, the penalties
are far too low to deter and punish such activity. Indeed, the
modest penalties now applicable may simply be written off as a
cost of doing business. </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 was intended to,
and did in fact, provide Federal law enforcement agents with
better tools for combatting drug traffickers. However, it is
still too early to evaluate how these tools have been used. </p>

<p>Important legislation in the field of drug abuse since 1981
has not been restricted only to matters relating to improving
drug law enforcement. As noted previously, Congress in 1979
rejected President Carter's proposal that NIDA's State formula
grants for drug abuse programs be consolidated with those for
alcoholism and mental health. Instead it reauthorized the drug
formula grants through September 30, 1981. In passing the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Congress reversed itself and
fundamentally changed the role that the Federal Government plays
in overseeing and funding of drug abuse prevention, treatment and
rehabilitation programs by creating an Alcohol and Drug Abuse and
Mental Health Service Block Grant (ADMS Block Grant). The new
program was designed to distribute the Federal money that had
previously been provided to the States through formula and
project grants and contracts. </p>

<p>One of the principal motivations for adopting the block grant
approach was the belief that the States were in the best position
to determine the most efficacious use of Federal funds: </p>

<p>The ADMS Block . . . [was] established in 1981 to provide
State and local governments greater flexibility and
decision-making authority in focusing Federal, State, and local
resources on needs and priorities they know best and in ways they
believe are best suited to local conditions. Block grants were
also intended to eliminate duplication and overlapping of
services and allow States to better integrate and coordinate
services funded by several levels of government. </p>

<p>In addition to establishing the ADMS Block Grant, the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act specified how the States were to spend
their allotment. Although requiring the States to file reports
with information permitting the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to determine whether the Federal funds provided were
expended in conformity with the objectives of the block grant,
the Act also directed the Secretary not to impose burdensome
reporting requirements. The reporting requirements concerning the
block grant imposed by the Secretary were much less extensive
than those existing under the categorical programs that existed
prior to the adoption of the block grant approach. </p>

<p>The impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act has been
estimated: Since the establishment of the ADMS Block Grant, the
amount of Federal money going to State drug abuse prevention and
treatment programs has declined by approximately 40 percent. It
is not possible, however, to determine what the impact of this
reduction has been because a portion, perhaps significant, of the
reduction represents savings due to the elimination of overhead
administrative costs. </p>

<p>Law Enforcement and Executive Responses to the Drug Problem. </p>

<p>Recognizing that drug abuse and drug trafficking are serious
national problems, which also pose a threat to national security,
the Reagan Administration has taken steps since 1981 that have
been designed to improve Federal law enforcement efforts against
drug traffickers. </p>

<p>Narcotics intelligence is essential to any drug law
enforcement program. In that regard, on December 4, 1981,
President Reagan issued an executive order, entitled &quot;United
States Intelligence Activities,&quot; which was intended to
&quot;control and provide direction and guidance to the
Intelligence Community.&quot; Among the executive order's
provisions relating to drugs, one authorizes agencies within the
U.S. Intelligence Community to participate in law enforcement
activities to investigate or prevent international narcotics
activities and to render assistance and cooperation to law
enforcement authorities not otherwise precluded by law. In
addition, agencies within the Intelligence Community are
authorized to collect, retain, or disseminate information
concerning U.S. persons obtained during the course of a lawful
international narcotics investigation or incidentally obtained
information indicating involvement in activities that may violate
federal, state, local or foreign laws. Finally, the Executive
Order directs that all departments and agencies involved in the
U.S. intelligence effort shall cooperate to provide the President
and the National Security Council with information on which to
base decisions concerning the conduct and development of foreign,
defense, and economic policy and the protection of U.S. national
interests. </p>

<p>Whether the U.S. Intelligence Community has played or will
play the important role in the Nation's anti-drug effort
envisioned for it by Executive Order 12333 depends upon the
commitment of its constituent departments and agencies to
eliminating this threat to national security. The Executive Order
was an important event because it represented recognition at the
highest level of the Executive Branch that, without accurate and
adequate strategic, operational, and tactical narcotics
intelligence, the Federal drug trafficking prevention effort
would be seriously crippled. </p>

<p>During 1981 the deleterious effect of drug trafficking on the
quality of life in Florida, and especially in South Florida, had
become so great that the State's citizens demanded prompt and
effective responses by government at all levels. At the Federal
level, President Reagan established on January 28, 1982, a
cabinet-level South Florida Task Force, also known as Operation
Florida, which was chaired by Vice President Bush, to
&quot;assist and coordinate Federal efforts with those of State
and local authorities in order to reduce crime&quot; and which
was patterned after previous multi-agency efforts, such as the
CENTAC program. The South Florida Task Force was intended to be a
&quot;broad, multifaceted anti-crime program,&quot; but its focus
was on interdiction and the arrest and prosecution of drug
smugglers. Assistance to the South Florida Task Force, which
became operational on March 15, 1982, was provided by DEA,
Customs, FBI, BATF, the Marshals Service, the Coast Guard, and
the Department of Defense. </p>

<p>One of the more significant features of the South Florida Task
Force was the creation of the South Florida Joint Task Group,
which consisted of DEA and Customs personnel and which was
charged with conducting follow-up investigations of drug
interdictions. In authorizing Customs agents to conduct such
investigations under the supervision of DEA on March 20, 1982,
the Attorney General modified, albeit slightly, the structure of
Federal drug enforcement that had been established by President
Nixon's 1973 reorganization plan. That plan had prohibited
Customs agents from exercising investigative, intelligence, and
law enforcement functions at locations away from ports of entry
or borders. This action was in effect a recognition, long
overdue, that it was necessary, if law enforcement efforts
against drug trafficking were to be improved, for Customs'
intelligence and investigative functions to be expanded. </p>

<p>Operations Greenback and Florida were successful in that they
forced traffickers to reduce their activities in Florida.
However, the increased law enforcement pressure, as had happened
so many times in the past, resulted in the traffickers diverting
drug smuggling to Gulf and Eastern ports of entry and their money
laundering activities to New York and the California-Mexico area.
The successes achieved by the Florida multiagency operations thus
exacerbated an already serious nationwide drug problem, but they
also provided a model for responding to that problem. In 1982 the
Attorney General appointed a committee to develop new approaches
to the drug trafficking problem. The Committee concluded that
&quot;no single agency could cope with the problem&quot; and that
&quot;many previous cooperative ventures, although limited in
scope by comparison, provided the promise that agencies can
cooperate and . . . only full-scale teamwork could meet the
crisis . . . .&quot; The Committee's conclusions led to President
Reagan's announcement on October 14, 1982, of the formation of 12
regional Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, which were
authorized in January 1983 and became operational during the
spring of that year. </p>

<p>The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program
(OCDETF Program) is modeled after the South Florida Task Force,
but its objectives are quite different. While the primary
objective of the South Florida Task Force is the interdiction of
drugs, the focus of the OCDETF Program is the leaders of large
organizations, which control drug importation and distribution
networks, and the disruption of those networks. The participating
Federal agencies are the U.S. Attorney's offices, DEA, FBI,
Customs, BATF, IRS, the Coast Guard, and the U.S. Marshals
Service. The OCDETF Program differs from previous multi-agency
law enforcement efforts in several respects: the task forces are
directly controlled by the Attorney General; the initial funding
was under the control of the Attorney General; and the task
forces are to focus on only one major segment of organized
criminal activity, drug trafficking. Because the OCDE Task Forces
are not intended to replace existing Federal enforcement efforts
against drugs and organized crime, the work of the organized
Crime Strike Forces and the South Florida Task Force continue, as
do the efforts of the FBI, DEA, Customs, and U.S. Attorneys
directed against organized crime groups involved in drug
trafficking. </p>

<p>Shortly after the establishment of the OCDETF Program, the
Reagan Administration adopted another multi-agency approach to
one facet of the Nation's supply reduction efforts, interdiction,
by creating the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System
(NNBIS) which was to be headed by Vice President Bush. NNBIS was
given the responsibility for informally coordinating the
interdiction efforts of other organizations; it could recommend,
but not require, that the organizations take certain actions, and
it itself was not authorized to interdict drugs. When it became
operational, NNBIS took over the interdiction coordination
responsibilities of the South Florida Task Force. Despite the
establishment of the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board in
1984, NNBIS continues to operate as an interdiction coordinating
body.<br>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter V Drug Enforcement, Policy, and Reducing Drug Demand </h2>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>The preceding chapter of this report discusses the historical
development of Federal drug policy and demonstrates that the
Federal response to the problems of drug abuse and drug
trafficking has become more complex over time. A good indicator
of the present complexity of the Federal response is the fact
that 32 Federal agencies are now involved in the multifaceted
effort to reduce the supply of and demand for drugs. In this
chapter, the Commission describes the current anti-drug efforts
of the principal Federal agencies and their roles in the national
strategy. The agencies are grouped by function, beginning with
those with central policy roles, followed by international
efforts, interdiction, domestic enforcement, data gathering,
intelligence, and United Nations efforts. </p>

<p>Overall Policy </p>

<p>The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board </p>

<p>The National Narcotics Act of 1984 created the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board (the Board). This Cabinet-level Board
consists of the Attorney General as Chairman and the Secretaries
of State, Treasury, Defense, Transportation, and Health and Human
Services, as well as the Directors of Central Intelligence and
the Office of Management and Budget, as members. It is the latest
manifestation in the persistent effort to achieve singularity of
purpose in the fight against drug abuse, despite the diversity of
Federal agencies involved. This fact is explicitly recognized in
the pertinent statutory language, found at 1302(b) of the Act, in
which Congress expresses its intent to: </p>

<p>(1) Maintain a national and international effort against
illegal drugs; </p>

<p>(2) Coordinate fully the activities of the Federal agencies
involved; and (3) Charge a single, competent, and responsible
high-level Board of the United States Government, chaired by the
Attorney General, with responsibility for coordinating United
States policy with respect to national and international drug law
enforcement. </p>

<p>This intent is based upon sweeping Congressional findings set
forth in Section 1302(a) of the Act: </p>

<p>(1) The flow of illegal narcotics into the United States is a
major and growing problem. </p>

<p>(2) The problem of illegal drug activity falls across the
entire spectrum of Federal activities both nationally and
internationally. </p>

<p>(3) Illegal drug trafficking is estimated by the General
Accounting office to be an $80 billion per annum industry in the
United States. </p>

<p>(4) The annual consumption of drugs has reached epidemic
proportions. </p>

<p>(5) Despite the efforts of the United States Government and
other nations, the mechanisms for smuggling opium and other hard
drugs into the United States remain virtually intact, and United
States agencies estimate that they are able to interdict no more
than 5 to 15 percent of all hard drugs flowing into the country. </p>

<p>(6) Such significant indicators of the drug problem as
drug-related deaths, emergency room visits, hospital admissions
due to drug-related incidents, and addiction rates are soaring. </p>

<p>(7) Increased drug trafficking is strongly linked to violent
addiction-related crime, and recent studies have shown that over
90 percent of heroin users rely upon criminal activity as a means
of income. </p>

<p>(8) Much of the drug trafficking is handled by syndicates, a
situation that results in increased violence and criminal
activity because of the competitive struggle for control of the
domestic drug market. </p>

<p>(9) Controlling the supply of illicit drugs is a key to
reducing the crime epidemic confronting every region of the
country. </p>

<p>(10) The magnitude and scope of the problem requires the
establishment of a National Drug Enforcement Policy Board,
chaired by the Attorney General, to facilitate coordination of
all Federal efforts by relevant agencies. </p>

<p>(11) Such a Board must have responsibility for coordinating
the operations of Federal agencies involved in attacking the
problem through the development of policy and resources, so that
a unified and efficient effort can be undertaken. </p>

<p>To accomplish the statutory purpose, S. 1304 of the Act
specifically empowers the Board to improve policy development and
coordination among Federal agencies by: </p>

<p>(1) reviewing, evaluating, and developing U.S. government
policy, strategy, and resources with respect to drug law
enforcement efforts, including the setting of budgetary
priorities and development of a national and international drug
enforcement strategy; </p>

<p>(2) facilitating coordination of all U.S. government efforts
to halt national and international trafficking in illegal drugs; </p>

<p>(3) coordinating the collection and evaluation of information
necessary to implement U.S. policy with respect to drug law
enforcement. </p>

<p>In furtherance of these aims S. 1306 of the Act directs the
Director of the Drug Abuse Policy Office to serve as an advisor
to the Board on matters related to health issues in the drug
abuse field. As a principal figure in the area of interdiction,
the Vice President is included as an ex officio member. </p>

<p>Under this scheme the Attorney General as Board Chairman, in
consultation with the other members, supervises the preparation
of initiatives for consideration by the Board. The Board, under
the direction of the Chairman, then determines which items to
include on its agenda and what priority each is to receive. Such
items are then referred to the Coordinating Group, chaired by the
Deputy Attorney General and consisting of senior officials from
the member agencies. </p>

<p>The Coordinating Group in turn is to submit to the Board
practical recommendations, based on consultation with the
agencies involved, for resolving drug law enforcement issues and
developing appropriate Federal policy. Both the Board and the
Coordinating Group are supported in their efforts by a full-time
professional staff charged with performing necessary research,
analysis, and writing. This staff is composed of individuals
drawn from various principal agencies. The intent of this
multi-agency composition at all levels, Board, Coordinating
Group, and staff, is a reflection of the Board's intent, as
expressed in its 1985 Interim Act to Congress: </p>

<p>This structure reflects the need for interagency participation
at every level of Policy Board activity. The underlying principle
is that there is a practical advantage to resolving differences
at the lowest level possible. Disagreements on issues will
inevitably occur among various agency participants, but if all
points of view are represented at each level, many differences
can be worked out by the Staff or Coordinating Group rather than
being elevated to the Policy Board. </p>

<p>Section 1304(a) of the Act specifically directs the Board to
focus its work on two parts of the five-point National Strategy
on Drug Abuse: drug law enforcement and international
cooperation. In the area of drug enforcement, the Board pursues
four principal strategies: 1) illegal drugs are to be destroyed
at their source; 2) drug contraband is to be intercepted and
seized en route to or at the borders of the United States; 3)
drug trafficking organizations are to be identified, investigated
and prosecuted, and drug related assets seized and forfeited; and
4) regulatory means are to be exercised to stem diverted drug
abuse. </p>

<p>The Board commenced its activities on April 24, 1985, almost a
year after its creation. In its first meeting, it adopted the
organizational structure described above. In the months between
April 1985 and the end of that year, the Board met five times and
the Coordinating Group, five times. Issues referred to the
Coordinating Group during that time include &quot;designer&quot;
drugs, efforts to improve government-wide drug seizure
statistics, and drug crisis management. Its agenda includes a
report in January 1986, required by the Narcotics Act of 1984, on
the Board's achievements and the effectiveness of its policies to
combat national and international drug trafficking. It is also to
publish a 1986 strategy report. Items under consideration for
inclusion in the Boards agenda are: </p>

<p>Budget Review. The Government has increased substantially the
amount of resources devoted to drug law enforcement. Because of
the numerous agencies and departments now involved in combatting
drug trafficking, the Policy Board is an ideal forum for
considering the Government's overall drug law enforcement budget.
The Board may undertake budget reviews to determine whether
resources are appropriately allocated. Consideration will also be
given to insuring proper interagency balance and the optimal use
of tax dollars and resources in the drug war. </p>

<p>Memoranda of Understanding. The Board may review the numerous
jurisdictional Memoranda of Understanding between Federal
agencies to determine the effectiveness of these mechanisms for
interagency cooperation. </p>

<p>Interdiction. The Board may examine all of the interdiction
programs currently in place. Since, in the last few years, the
Federal Government has made an increased effort to prevent
illegal drugs from entering the United States, the Board may
propose to analyze the effectiveness of interdiction as an
overall law enforcement strategy. The Board will also consider
the experience gained from the 1981 exception to the Posse
Comitatus Act to determine whether additional legislative action
is needed. </p>

<p>Eradication. The Board proposes to assess the efficacy of all
eradication strategies and the cost-effectiveness of eradication
as a drug law enforcement strategy. In addition, it will address
how eradication relates to other elements of our enforcement
strategy. Because domestic marijuana reduction involves a number
of agencies, this issue is well suited to a study by the Policy
Board and its staff. </p>

<p>Other Issues. The Board may also refer other issues for
additional staff analysis. These might include: money laundering;
financial investigative techniques, including asset forfeiture;
the relationship of supply and demand reduction strategies; and
the collection and sharing of drug intelligence. </p>

<p>The Board's vision of its role is summed up in its Interim
Report: </p>

<p>The Board is assuming the task of coordinating all drug
related programs. To do this, the Board may develop a planning
and management process for policy development and evaluation of
the nation's narcotics law enforcement programs. </p>

<p>White House Drug Abuse Policy Office </p>

<p>Created within the White House by Executive Order 12368, the
Drug Policy Abuse Office was established to ensure that the
President is provided with a center for coordination and
oversight of both national and international drug abuse functions
of all executive branch agencies. The role of this office has
been expanded to include drug trafficking issues as well. The
office publishes a regular report on both drug abuse and drug
trafficking, the National Strategy, which provides policy
direction for all agencies involved in anti-drug efforts. As part
of the White House Office of Policy Development, the White House
Drug Abuse Policy Office provides the President with a direct
advisor on drug abuse policy matters. </p>

<p>International Efforts </p>

<p>Bureau of International Narcotics Matters </p>

<p>As the Federal agency responsible for coordinating the United
States' drug control efforts overseas, the Department of State's
Bureau of International Narcotics Matters (BINM) is pivotal in
implementing U.S. anti-drug policy on the international level.
BINM attempts to encourage foreign coordination for joint illicit
drug control activities; bilateral assistance for crop control
and interdiction programs in the form of equipment, training and
technical advisory services; participation in international
organizations to increase drug control efforts in licit and
illicit drug production countries; training programs for foreign
personnel in illicit drug control functions to strengthen
interdiction and enforcement efforts; guidance, coordination and
support of the work abroad of all U.S. government agencies
involved in drug control; and technical assistance for
international demand reduction. BINM currently provides support
for drug eradication efforts in 14 countries and is in large part
responsible for much of the world's crop control and eradication
efforts, described elsewhere in this report. </p>

<p>Agency for International Development </p>

<p>Section 126 of the Foreign Assistance Act instructs the Agency
for International Development (AID) to &quot;give priority
consideration to programs which would help reduce illicit
narcotics cultivation by stimulating broader development
opportunities.&quot; Given this mandate, AID issued Policy
Determination No. 1 on drugs in 1982, encouraging the design of
projects that provide economic alternatives to farmers in drug
growing areas. Overseas, AID coordinates with the State
Department's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters. </p>

<p>AID drug control efforts include finding a suitable mix of
substitute crops, assuring free market incentives, and
encouraging appropriate host country pricing and marketing
policies. AID attempts to develop and implement development
projects that facilitate the host government's enforcement of
existing bans on drug production. </p>

<p>Department of Agriculture </p>

<p>The United States Department of Agriculture through the
Agricultural Research Service (ARS) assists in the control of
illicit drug plants by providing technical information pertaining
to eradication and substitute crops. Scientists in the ARS
conduct research on the use of herbicides and other techniques
for eradication, as well as the use of substitute crops for
farmers presently producing drugs. ARS scientists also provide
expert advice to the State Department and cooperating foreign
countries regarding proposed eradication programs. Potential
adverse environmental impacts are assessed prior to the
recommendation of control measures, whether it be chemical,
mechanical, fire, biological, or through genetic manipulation or
a combination of two or more of these techniques. Scientists from
ARS have been involved in drug research since 1972 and have
assisted control authorities in several drug producing countries
in the Americas and the Near and Far East. </p>

<p>Interdiction </p>

<p>National Narcotics Border Interdiction System </p>

<p>The National Narcotics Border Interdiction System (NNBIS)
attempts to accomplish comprehensive planning in the limited area
of interdiction at or approaching U.S. borders. NNBIS was created
by the President on March 23, 1983, and is directed by the Vice
President. </p>

<p>NNBIS' mission is to improve border interdiction by
accomplishing a threefold goal: to continue to improve
interagency coordination among law enforcement agencies; to
maximize the participation of the military services and Federal
agencies involved in drug interdiction; and to increase and
provide interaction for intelligence community involvement in
interdiction efforts. Participating agencies include the U.S.
Customs Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Drug Enforcement
Administration (of particular importance is the contribution of
DEA's El Paso Intelligence Center - EPIC) the Border Patrol, the
Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the
Federal Aviation Administration, the National oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, the Federal Communications
Commission, and the Department of State. NNBIS itself consists of
a headquarters staff in Washington, D.C. and six regional
offices: Miami, New Orleans, El Paso, New York, Chicago and Long
Beach, California. </p>

<p>Actual interdiction at or approaching U.S. borders is
accomplished by individual agencies during single agency or
multi-agency special operations. The role of NNBIS is to provide
necessary equipment, intelligence, detection and trend analysis
support. Specific NNBIS contributions to drug seizures consist of
direct support, such as the passing of &quot;real-time&quot;
information, general information, or regional analysis. NNBIS
staffs, consisting of agency-contributed personnel in both
Washington and the regional centers, coordinate with contributing
agency staffs to lay the groundwork for special initiatives,
which then can proceed in a timely fashion to enhance drug law
enforcement efforts. Of critical importance in understanding
NNBIS' role is the fact that the activity has no funding of its
own. It is entirely dependent upon agency contributions of
manpower and intelligence and does not have a direct operational
authority. It can only inform and advise its constituent agencies
concerning opportunities for coordinated or expanded operations.
Thus, criticisms of NNBIS, alleging that many seizures would have
occurred anyway, even if NNBIS did not exist, miss the point.
Individual agencies are intended, indeed mandated, to carry out
their missions, including contraband seizures. NNBIS is intended
to supplement, not replace, those efforts. It has a steadily
improving record of doing so, a fact recognized even by some
critics. </p>

<p>Operation Hat Trick I </p>

<p>In the fall of 1984 Hat Trick I, the first major coordination
effort attempted under the NNBIS management mechanism, was
undertaken. Hat Trick I was designed to disrupt the transshipment
of the fall harvest of marijuana from Colombia, while
simultaneously intercepting any cocaine shipped during the
operation. </p>

<p>During the 60-day operation, an intercept line of Coast Guard
and Navy ships was formed in the Caribbean to halt smuggling
vessels. The Department of Defense supplemented the operation
with electronic equipment capable of detecting both aircraft
which flew over the ships and vessels which slipped through the
net. Additionally, the Customs Service and Border Patrol
increased their efforts at and between the ports of entry to the
United States, and the intelligence community added previously
unprecedented support to the effort. This multi-agency approach
emphasized the critical need for compatible communications
capabilities. This lesson is being carried forward in current
operational planning. </p>

<p>The anticipated reaction to this operation was an attempt by
the smugglers in Colombia to stockpile shipments. To counter
this, multi-agency teams, headed by the Department of State,
visited Colombia and neighboring countries to brief officials
there about the operation and to elicit their support. The
Colombian government, which had declared a &quot;war without
quarter&quot; against drugs the previous year, seized the
opportunity to step up efforts to destroy the marijuana in that
country. Colombian officials were also placed aboard U.S. Coast
Guard cutters, operating off the Colombian coast to coordinate
with Colombian enforcement units. </p>

<p>Operation Hat Trick I proceeded as expected, with massive
maritime seizures, and a significant reduction of maritime drug
shipments. According to NNBIS, over 600,000 pounds of marijuana
and 6,000 pounds of cocaine were seized by U.S. agencies during
the operation. Simultaneously, the Colombian government, through
eradication and destruction of stockpiled contraband, removed
over 50 percent of the fall marijuana crop from possible export. </p>

<p>Operation Hat Trick II </p>

<p>Operation Hat Trick I has come to be viewed as a prototype
effort in it initiated improvements in planning, communications
security, in-country efforts, air operations, intelligence and
resource support. Hat Trick II, a much more ambitious operation
begun in November 1985 and still under way, is the logical
follow-on, drawing carefully on lessons learned from Hat Trick I.
</p>

<p>Coordinated by NNBIS and consisting of the combined forces of
U.S. civilian drug enforcement agencies and all branches of the
military, Hat Trick II involves increased land and air patrols to
disrupt drug traffic into the United States. The long-term goal
of the operation is to affect the worldwide availability of drugs
by increasing international pressure on trafficking
organizations. It is a complex operation that tightens
surveillance along our border with Mexico and along the known air
and ocean supply routes from South America and other Caribbean
countries. </p>

<p>The United States Navy and the Coast Guard, working together,
provide the primary maritime surveillance and interdiction forces
for Hat Trick II, while the U.S. Customs Service works as the
lead agency with the Navy, Air Force, Army and Marines in
directing air operations. The Customs Service and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service Border Patrol are conducting
intensified operations all along U.S. land and sea borders.
Through Department of State and DEA initiatives, the U.S. is
working to provide the maximum coordination of anti-drug efforts
in foreign countries. </p>

<p>Hat Trick II employs military surveillance aircraft to
identify and track smugglers and to exploit the known routes
traffickers use from their source countries to their ultimate
destination. If the smugglers attempt to hide and wait in a
source or transit country, the drug enforcement authorities in
those countries are prepared to seize drugs and make arrests. An
important key to Hat Trick II lies in the ability of source and
transit countries to take advantage of the disruption the United
States has caused in normal drug trafficking. Colombia, Panama,
Venezuela, Jamaica and other countries throughout the region are
cooperating in this international effort. </p>

<p>Hat Trick II has contributed significantly to institutional
change among involved agencies. For example, as a result of
planning initiatives for Hat Trick II, the U.S. Navy has changed
its policies, and Navy ships have served as platforms for a
significantly increased number of Coast Guard interdictions.
Further, military radars have become a much more significant
factor in aircraft seizures. The diversions in smuggling routes
and methods caused by the operation have made drug trafficking a
more costly enterprise for smugglers, and secure communications
enhancements have kept operational information away from them.
Major cocaine seizures have resulted from U.S. Bahamian
cooperation. The intelligence community has greatly increased its
collection and dissemination of tactical intelligence. Each law
enforcement agency has, in essence, developed specialized
intra-agency operations in support of the overall Hat Trick II
effort. </p>

<p>Operation Blue Lightning </p>

<p>To test the effectiveness of conducting an operation with
Federal, State and local participation, as well as exercising the
growing U.S.-Bahamian partnership against drug smuggling, a major
special operation, entitled &quot;Blue Lightning,&quot; was
devised and coordinated from the NNBIS Regional Center in Miami. </p>

<p>Blue Lightning concentrated on two geographical areas, the
Bahamian Archipelago and the area West of the Bahamas up to and
including the coast of Florida. In the Bahamas islands were
targeted as &quot;stash sites,&quot; or drug holding areas, and
unannounced sweep teams were flown in to search for contraband.
The sweep teams were composed of Bahamian Police, transported by
U.S. military helicopters. Efforts were coordinated by the DEA
and U.S. Embassy in Nassau. The effort outside the Bahamas
included coordinated, augmented air and sea detection capability
up to the Florida coast. As a primary participant in the NNBIS
coordinated operation, the U.S. Customs Service was requested to
assume lead agency status for the portion of the operation
outside the Bahamas. Overall Blue Lightning participants included
16 State, county and city law enforcement agencies, the Customs
Service, Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and National Park
Service in addition to the DEA and the Government of the Bahamas.
Additionally, Bahamian personnel were assigned to South Florida
for the duration of the operation to fly law enforcement missions
with U.S. Customs. </p>

<p>The raids by Bahamian authorities forced smugglers to move
their drugs to the U.S. immediately, where law enforcement units
were positioned to intercept them. Over 6,000 pounds of cocaine,
33,000 pounds of marijuana, and over $1.5 million worth of
vessels, aircraft, trailers and cash were seized. Additionally,
interdiction techniques were tested and refined, heightening the
ability to conduct coordinated international and interagency
operations. </p>

<p>U.S. Coast Guard </p>

<p>Responsible in large part for U.S. drug interdiction efforts,
the Coast Guard's strategy has been mainly directed toward
intercepting motherships as they transit the major passes of the
Caribbean. To effect this &quot;choke point&quot; strategy, the
Coast Guard conducts both continuous surface patrols and frequent
surveillance flights over the waters of interest, and boards and
inspects suspect vessels at sea. In the past major Coast Guard
resources have been concentrated in the &quot;choke points&quot;
traditionally transversed by traffickers. Cutters now more
frequently patrol the Bahamas, the eastern passes of the
Caribbean, and the Gulf, Atlantic and Pacific coastal areas. </p>

<p>During the past several years the Coast Guard has increased
the number of cutter patrol days and aircraft operating hours
devoted to drug interdiction, increasing their ability to respond
quickly to sightings and other intelligence. In addition, the
Coast Guard is deploying leased Sea Based Aerostats (SBAs), which
are small tethered balloons equipped with surface search radar,
tethered offshore at sufficient altitude to greatly increase its
range. As part of a coordinated operation, surface target
information is paused to a command and control cutter for
evaluation and deployment of other assigned units, both surface
and air. </p>

<p>Better intelligence remains an important factor in increasing
the Coast Guard's overall interdiction effectiveness. The most
critical need is timely and accurate information on the number,
identity, location and destination of vessels and aircraft
carrying contraband which are bound for the United States. During
the past two years improvements have been made in the collection,
evaluation, and dissemination of intelligence. A new intelligence
coordination center in Washington, D.C. maintains a 24-hour
all-source watch to exploit all intelligence systems available to
the Coast Guard, and produces intelligence tailored to the needs
of operational commanders. The Coast Guard is also continuing
liaison with the law enforcement community's intelligence
network. </p>

<p>U.S. Customs Service </p>

<p>The U.S. Customs Service participates in several multiagency
investigative programs, including the Florida Joint Task Group
and the President's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.
The efforts of these two programs alone resulted in 1,194 arrests
and drug seizures of 35,702 pounds of cocaine, 132 pounds of
heroin, and 3,848,293 pounds of marijuana from FY 1952 to FY
1985. </p>

<p>Prompted by the increasing sophistication of violators of
critical technology and trade laws, including individuals in
drug-related activities, the Customs Service established an
Office of Intelligence in 1981. Customs-acquired intelligence of
national security interest is, for the first time, actively being
disseminated to community agencies, and the intelligence
community is currently developing information useful for drug
enforcement. The development of secure communications facilities
within the Customs Service, currently underway, will further
enhance this capability. </p>

<p>The Customs Aviation and Marine Programs are consistently
changed and upgraded to reflect new technologies and equipment
and improved tactics and strategy. Drug smugglers have responded
to these programs by adjusting their routes to elude the
increased effectiveness of enforcement officials. </p>

<p>The Customs Service has developed teams of inspectors and
canine enforcement officers to more thoroughly examine persons,
conveyances, and cargo determined to be high risk. These mobile
teams, which use highly trained dogs to detect drugs, allow
Customs to release cargo and passengers deemed to be low risk
without examination, thus speeding the entry of most people and
cargo. The teams comprise 12 percent of the inspectional
workforce, but have accounted for the greater proportion of the
drug seizures. During the first 9 months of FY 1985, they have
been responsible for 66 percent (10,269 pounds) of the hashish,
87 percent (876 pounds) of the cocaine, and 40 percent (243
pounds) of the heroin that has been seized by inspectors. </p>

<p>During the past three years, the Customs Service has attempted
to convince the commercial air and sea carriers of their
responsibilities in the effort to halt drug trafficking. As part
of this initiative Customs contacted the major carriers and
signed cooperative agreements with a number of them. These set
out specific measures designed to prevent and detect the use of
commercial vessels and aircraft that smuggle drugs and other
contraband. Customs works closely with carriers, to apprise them
of their vulnerabilities through regular meetings; to provide a
training program on cargo, aircraft, and facility security; to
perform security surveys; and to compile threat assessments. This
cooperation between Customs and commercial carriers has led to
the detection of drugs and the transmittal of valuable
intelligence to local customs officials. </p>

<p>Department of Defense </p>

<p>In 1981 Congress passed legislation clarifying statutory
restrictions on the use of Department of Defense (DOD) resources
for law enforcement purposes. As a result, the Department of
Defense now has greater freedom to support Federal law
enforcement agencies. DOD resources play an important role in the
Federal drug interdiction program by providing surveillance and
support services, such as using aircraft to search for smugglers
and Navy ships to tow or escort vessels seized by the Coast Guard
to the nearest U.S. port. As of the end of September 1985, the
DOD has been involved in 38 vessel seizures, and their assistance
has been invaluable during NNBIS-directed joint operations. </p>

<p>DOD's increased involvement in drug law enforcement as a
result of amendments to the Posse Comitatus Act, has proved
pivotal in many instances. In fact, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
recommended unanimously in early 1985 that the U.S. military be
engaged to an unprecedented extent in fighting drug trafficking
and production. It called for the implementation of a massive new
program in which military forces would expand their present
supportive role by becoming involved in drug interdiction, in
training Central American nation's anti-drug forces, and in
providing needed weapons and equipment. </p>

<p>Domestic Enforcement </p>

<p>Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program </p>

<p>The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program
(OCDETF), comprised of 13 Task Forces nationwide, brings all
Federal agencies with drug enforcement responsibilities together
into a coordinated effort against the largest and most important
national and international drug trafficking rings. Justice
Department agencies involved in the effort include the FBI, the
DEA, and the Marshals Service; Treasury Department agencies
include the U.S. Customs Service, the Bureau of Tobacco, Alcohol,
and Firearms, and the International Revenue Service. The Coast
Guard has a major role in the program as well, and the Department
of Defense offers intelligence and information on sightings of
suspected drug traffickers heading for the U.S. by sea and air. </p>

<p>In slightly more than two and one-half years, the Task Force
has produced 1,721 indictments against 6,545 defendants. The Task
Force emphasis is on prosecuting and imprisoning drug kingpins,
money launderers, and financiers. There is also strong focus on
seizing cash and drug-related assets. In fact, the assets seized
may soon exceed the cost of the Task Force program. </p>

<p>The Task force Program relies largely on the Continuing
Criminal Enterprise Statutory provision and the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. The
conviction rate in cases reaching disposition is approximately 95
percent. State and local officers participate in nearly one-half
of the Task Force investigations. </p>

<p>New international law enforcement cooperation also has been
achieved, since nearly one-half of Task Force cases target
organizations international in scope. These efforts have received
substantial support from foreign law enforcement agencies, as
indicated by the fact that five percent of Task Force cases now
involve direct participation by foreign police. This has created
a new focal point for international drug investigations. </p>

<p>Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<p>As the lead Federal drug agency the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) is charged with enforcing the controlled
substance laws and regulations of the United States. DEA also
participates in non-enforcement programs to reduce the demand for
drugs. Part of the Department of Justice, DEA comprises 2,400
special agents in 121 domestic field offices and 61 offices in
over 40 foreign countries. </p>

<p>DEA's primary objectives are: </p>

<p>- To bring to bear all the Federal resources on the arrest,
prosecution, and immobilization of major drug trafficking
organizations via continued coordination with other Federal
agencies and the use of financial and legal tools, emerging
technology, and sophisticated investigative techniques. </p>

<p>- To reduce the supply of illicit drugs from source countries,
thereby reducing the availability of illicit drugs in the United
States and abroad via source country initiatives, assistance to
foreign government, training for foreign law enforcement
authorities, and public support for successful foreign government
endeavors. </p>

<p>- To significantly reduce the diversion of controlled
substances from the legitimate channels in which they are
manufactured, distributed, and dispensed through a vigorous
program of investigations and State, local, and international
cooperation. </p>

<p>- To enlist the active participation of State and local
governments and law enforcement agencies in the national drug
eradication program, clandestine laboratory task forces, State
and local task forces, and other multi-state coordinative
efforts. </p>

<p>- To participate actively and aggressively in the Federal,
State, and local effort to mobilize public support for the drug
enforcement and abuse prevention program by implementing
strategies and educational programs that stimulate cooperation
among State and local criminal justice agencies, school,
businesses, civic, and parent groups. </p>

<p>- To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of DEA
operations through the implementation of specific programs
designed to enhance employee performance. </p>

<p>Domestic Eradication Programs </p>

<p>The DEA's Domestic Eradication/Suppression Program has
expanded significantly since the Drug Enforcement Administration
first provided eradication assistance to Hawaii in 1979, and
currently all 50 States participate in this venture. DEA
encourages State and local eradication and provides training,
equipment, funding and investigative and aircraft resources. In
1984, with 48 States participating, approximately 3.8 million
marijuana plants were eradicated. The Secretary of the Interior
has also been authorized by a recent Executive Order to conduct
an extensive eradication program targeting marijuana plants on
Federal lands. Spraying commenced on October 6, 1985. </p>

<p>El Paso Intelligence Center </p>

<p>The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) is the Drug Enforcement
Administration's national drug information center, with
intelligence systems located at DEA headquarters, and in DEA's
foreign and domestic offices. EPIC's strategic intelligence
program furnishes geographic assessments, estimates, and warnings
of drug availability, production, trafficking trends and routes.
It distributes information to foreign, Federal, State and local
agencies through numerous publications. Its operational
intelligence program directly supports investigations underway
against top-level traffickers and supplies information on
specific organizations and their financial assets to support
investigations worldwide. As appropriate, this intelligence is
shared with other Federal, State and local agencies to ensure its
maximum utilization against drug traffickers. EPIC serves as a
clearinghouse for drug information collected 24 hours a day. With
DEA as its lead agency, EPIC is staffed by special agents and
intelligence analysts working with personnel from the FBI,
Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Marshals Service, Federal Aviation
Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Customs
Service, Coast Guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
the Departments of Defense and State, and members of the Federal
intelligence community. Today all States participate in EPIC
through chartered arrangements made between DEA and the
individual States. </p>

<p>Federal Bureau of Investigation </p>

<p>Although DEA is nominally the lead Drug Enforcement Agency,
its Director reports to the Director of the FBI. In granting the
FBI concurrent jurisdiction with DEA, the Attorney General has
mandated that the FBI assume a significant drug enforcement role.
He has also directed that FBI expertise in such areas as
organized crime financial investigations and white-collar crime
investigations be fully used in drug enforcement work. </p>

<p>Both DEA and the FBI place strong emphasis on major
distributors and organizations involved in the manufacturing,
importing, distributing and financing of illicit controlled
substances. Conspiracy investigations (particularly the
Continuing Criminal Enterprise and Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Statutes) are the focal point of
investigation efforts. </p>

<p>Internal Revenue Service </p>

<p>Within the Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) plays a critical role in U.S. drug control efforts
by targeting drug traffickers' profits. IRS Financial
Investigative Task Forces rely on the reports of financial
transactions, filed by banks and other institutions, to identify
financiers of criminal activities and money laundering
specialists. These reports include Currency Transaction Reports
and Foreign Bank Accounts Reports. Through these Task Forces
trace the transferrals of large sums of cash and identify the
proceeds of drug trafficking. </p>

<p>Data Gathering </p>

<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse </p>

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is the principal
source for current information about the effects of drug abuse.
NIDA was established in 1972 as part of the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, and for its first nine years, operated
under a broad mandate that included providing direct financial
assistance for drug abuse education, training, treatment, and
rehabilitation, as well as conducting research programs. With the
passage of The Alcohol and Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services
Block Grant in 1981, full responsibility for carrying out
treatment and prevention service functions was transferred from
NIDA to the States. </p>

<p>Now a part of the Department of Health and Human Service,
NIDA's current role in reducing demand, as set forth both in the
National Strategy and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Amendments of
1983, is to develop and disseminate new knowledge about drug
abuse, its prevention and treatment, and to exercise national
leadership in encouraging and assisting the private sector, the
States, and local governments to implement and support drug abuse
prevention and treatment programs in their communities. </p>

<p>The NIDA research program has several important components.
Through its epidemiological research program NIDA assesses the
nature and extent of the nation's drug abuse problem and its
trends. NIDA supports two ongoing epidemiological surveys, the
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the High School
Senior Survey. NIDA's Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) monitors
information on the health consequences of drug use through
emergency room visit statistics and through medical examiner
reports. In addition to these major efforts, NIDA provides grants
for a number of special epidemiological studies. </p>

<p>National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee </p>

<p>The 11-agency National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers
Committee consists of the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs Service,
the Departments of Defense, State and Treasury, Drug Enforcement
Administration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, National
Institute on Drug Abuse, White House Drug Abuse Policy Office,
Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service.
This Committee was created as the primary vehicle at the national
level for review and dissemination of strategic intelligence. It
publishes an annual report, the &quot;Narcotics Intelligence
Estimate,&quot; which details the supply of drugs to the U.S.
illicit market from foreign and domestic sources, and their
patterns and rates of use. </p>

<p>Intelligence </p>

<p>Central Intelligence Agency </p>

<p>Since the signing of Executive Order 12333 in December 1981,
the Central Intelligence Agency has provided assistance to drug
law enforcement efforts through the collection, analysis, and
dissemination of information regarding foreign narcotics
production. The CIA plans to upgrade its capabilities to gather
and assess drug-related intelligence over the next five years,
and is currently coordinating research to develop technologies
which can be used to better detect drug trafficking. </p>

<p>United Nations </p>

<p>United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control </p>

<p>As the drug control arm of the United Nations, the United
Nations for Drug Abuse Control was established in 1979 to assist
governments by helping finance projects aimed at reducing the
illicit supply of and demand for drugs. Projects undertaken by
the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control include replacing
illicit opium cultivation, treating and rehabilitating drug
addicts, strengthening control measures, or organizing
information and education programs. The Fund relies entirely on
voluntary contributions, mainly from governments but also from
private sources. The United States has long been the primary
contributor to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control. In
early 1983, however, the Fund obtained a $40 million pledge,
extending over a five year period, from the government of Italy
for coca control projects in South America. In early 1984 major
donors to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control agreed
that development assistance to narcotics growing regions should
be linked to government commitments to control illicit drug
production.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter VI Part 1: Current Supply Strategies: Analysis and
Recommendations </h2>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Currently, the great bulk of our Federal drug abuse budget is
devoted to strategies aimed at cutting off the supply of drugs
available to users and prospective users. These strategies, such
as source country eradication, interdiction, and domestic
enforcement, are frequently attacked as expensive, too slow in
producing perceptible results, and frequently dangerous for the
public officials charged with carrying them out. Far too often
such criticism seems to be the result of isolated examination
without regard to the programs' proper long-term goal or
relationship to strategic approaches to reduce demand. </p>

<p>This report attempts to avoid such pitfalls, and in this
chapter, examines and analyzes in its proper context, each of our
Federal efforts to reduce supply. It makes recommendations to
encourage a coordinated, comprehensive effort at restricting the
flow of drugs to the maximum extent possible, while complementary
demand reduction programs take hold. </p>

<p>Legalization of Illicit Drugs </p>

<p>The debate over strategies to reduce supply has produced a
wide range of proposals, including at one extreme the suggestion
that currently illicit drugs be legalized. Profits in the drug
trade are enormous, primarily because drugs are in high demand
and because traffickers charge prices high enough to justify the
risks involved. Proponents of legalization argue that because of
the clear connection between illegal drug trafficking and
organized crime, making drugs legal would remove the enormous
profits in the illicit drug industry a priority. </p>

<p>On the surface, this argument appears to have some merit.
However, it omits any consideration of the health costs of drug
abuse to the individual and to society, a dimension this
Commission views as fundamental. The drugs discussed in this
report are inherently destructive to mind and body.
&quot;Legalized&quot; drugs would still alter behavior, impair
productivity and educational potential, damage vital organs, and
kill. Moreover, legalization would almost certainly increase
demand, and therefore spread this destruction. Finally, this
Commission is not persuaded that legalization would result in
organized crime's abandonment of the drug business. While demand
for drugs in the United States represents a significant share of
global drug consumption, many other countries have a considerable
demand for drugs that would continue to be met by some or the
same organized crime groups now confronting this country. </p>

<p>It is the position of this Commission that legalizing
substances, which by their very nature destroy rather than
benefit the individual and society, will not solve the problem of
drug trafficking and is therefore not a viable option. This
Commission is emphatic in its position that legalization of drug
use is not a viable option. </p>

<p>National Drug Enforcement Policy Board </p>

<p>The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board (&quot;the
Board&quot;), presents a rare, possibly even unique, opportunity
to bring focus and singularity of purpose to the Federal
anti-drug effort. That fact is explicitly recognized in the
legislation creating the Board, wherein Congress acknowledges
that for the first time, a single, competent, and responsible
high-level Board of the United States Government, chaired by the
Attorney General, will be charged with this responsibility of
coordinating United States policy with respect to national and
international drug law enforcement. </p>

<p>The sentiment is echoed by the Justice Department's own
handbook discussing the National Narcotics Act of 1984, which
identifies the Act as &quot;a substantially revised version of
earlier 'Drug Czar' proposals.&quot; </p>

<p>This Commission recognizes and has pointed out repeatedly in
this report that drug abuse, a term including all of the medical,
social, and legal costs imposed on the American people by illegal
drugs, is a problem of proportions unmatched in any other area of
law enforcement. A problem of such dimensions demands a
coordinated response by the Federal government. The creation of
the Board is a major step toward a truly unified, coordinated
enforcement effort. </p>

<p>The performance of the Board to date has been somewhat
ambiguous. On the positive side, the Board has begun to meet, has
adopted an effective and comprehensive membership list for its
Coordinating Group, and has assembled a professional staff,
composed of experienced and able agency representatives. </p>

<p>It is troubling to note, however, that in light of the
acknowledged urgency of the drug abuse situation, characterized
by Congress as an &quot;epidemic,&quot; marked by
&quot;soaring&quot; death rates and a &quot;key to reducing the
crime epidemic confronting every region of the country,&quot; the
Board has yet to assert a clear leadership role. Instead, it has
adopted a more relaxed and collegial approach, waiting three
months after the effective date of the Act to hold its first
meeting. The Board began its work with a suggestion from the
Justice Department that the Board's mandate is &quot;. . . quite
broad and allows a range of possible roles - from an essentially
passive research and analysis to active implementation of drug
policies.&quot; This Commission notes with alarm that this
contemplative expression does not even extend to policy
formulation, which is the core of the Act's mandate. This concern
is heightened by the Board's initial choice of agenda items:
&quot;designer drugs,&quot; drug seizure statistics, and drug
management. These topics are certainly important, but only one,
seizure statistics, would have an impact on the formulation of a
coordinated drug enforcement policy. Even that connection is
remote. Uniform statistics are an important step toward
compilation of the reliable data base necessary to formulate
policy and measure its effectiveness, but that is all they are.
It is also troubling that the Board's first Interim Report to
Congress consists almost entirely of a verbatim recitation of
portions of the 1984 National Strategy. </p>

<p>An urgent but rational approach to the problem of drug abuse
is needed. This must begin with the statement of a goal. What is
the ultimate objective of the policy Board and of our drug
enforcement effort generally? This Commission is of the opinion
that the success of a national drug enforcement effort should
ultimately be measured in terms of reduced usage. The poisoning
of minds and bodies is the evil we are combatting. All other
targets - manufacture or cultivation, processing, smuggling,
distribution, and so on - would be of no consequence were it not
for the terrible destructive force of the use of illegal drugs.
Eliminating drug use, then, must be the cornerstone of a national
policy, and our national operational design - our strategy -
should flow from it. It is at this fundamental level that the
Board's deliberations should begin, difficult as the dialogue may
be. </p>

<p>A key to achieving the Board's essential singularity of
purpose is the commitment of each Board member, on behalf of his
entire Department, to the goal of reducing drug consumption,
accompanied by a resolve that no opportunity for action,
particularly coordinated, multi-agency approaches, will be
ignored on the basis of parochial concerns. However, the use of a
committee in place of a single figure of authority runs the
inherent risk of preserving interagency competition. It is
encouraging to note that the Board has included as
&quot;potential items&quot; for review total budgetary planning
and administrative operations. This Commission submits that
vigorous review of the latter is urgently needed, with special
attention to what is not included in such memoranda and the
reasons for such omissions. </p>

<p>A combined and coordinated effort among the dozens of Federal
agencies and offices, measured by a single standard of success,
is certain to require program dislocations, reordering of
Departmental priorities, and subordination of Departmental plans
to Board direction. It will mean abandoning the &quot;Not
Invented Here&quot; veto, which has far too often blocked
inter-Departmental efforts. Cooperation is the heart of a truly
coordinated national attack on drug abuse. It will require not
just review, analysis and coordination, but initiative by the
Board to overcome unnecessary obstacles, outmoded concepts, and
self-protective agency narrowness. Success will also depend upon
careful attention to long-term coordination between Federal
agency operations and with State and local components, for if
experience has shown anything in the effort against drug
trafficking, it is the resourcefulness and adaptability of the
traffickers. Successful interdiction or enforcement in one area
is virtually certain to result in a relocation to a new area of
operations. Long range planning is critical if our resources are
to be used in a fashion which anticipates such movement, rather
than reacts to it. </p>

<p>It is neither possible nor desirable under our system of law
to invest a Board Chairman or any other &quot;Czar&quot; with
dictatorial power to command other Cabinet members to conduct the
affairs of their respective Departments in a particular fashion.
This fact is reflected in the tone of the Act, which empowers the
Chairman only to &quot;advise, recommend, correlate and
evaluate&quot; and to direct action only with &quot;the
concurrence of the head of the agency&quot; involved. Such terms,
intended to recognize the independence of the various
Cabinet-level agencies, also spread among them a common
responsibility for the success or failure of this vital task. </p>

<p>Intelligence </p>

<p>Accurate, timely, and complete intelligence is vital to the
efficiency of United States anti-drug efforts. Strategies to
reduce the supply of drugs, such as eradication, interdiction,
investigations, and prosecutions are dependent on effective
intelligence gathering. Less commonly acknowledged is that
strategies to reduce demand are similarly dependent on such
intelligence. Adequate data is the foundation upon which focused,
purposeful programs to reduce demand must be built. There is
substantial evidence to suggest that such a foundation is often
lacking in our current approaches. </p>

<p>Intelligence concerning both drug abuse and drug trafficking
must be shared between strategists who are working to reduce
supply and demand. Evidence indicates that thorough strategic
planning, whether concerned with the reduction of demand or with
attacks on supply, must carefully consider the available data on
the other side of the equation. For example, to achieve the most
carefully reasoned deployment of resources, decisions concerning
priorities for disrupting the supply of a particular drug should
consider not only the geographical and political conditions in
source and transit locations, but also carefully evaluate the
geographic and demographic data concerning drug consumption. Such
coordination of data from both sides of the supply-demand dynamic
is crucial to long-range planning. An awareness of traffickers'
ultimate markets will facilitate anticipatory deployment of
resources. This unified theory of planning is the basis for the
&quot;all source&quot; intelligence center discussed below. </p>

<p>Domestic Data Collection </p>

<p>One principal category of drug-related intelligence is
consumption and law enforcement data formally collected within
the United States. Such data are essential to describe and
measure the problems of drug abuse and trafficking. They are also
vital to our efforts to evaluate the effects of various efforts
to reduce the supply of and demand for drugs. The reliability of
these estimates is critical for both policy makers and drug law
enforcement officials. However, because drug trafficking and use
are illicit activities, data concerning them are necessarily
estimates. Compounding this problem is the fragmentation of the
current system of drug data gathering. Much greater coordination
is imperative. </p>

<p>Two primary ongoing studies are used to measure the number of
drug users and frequency of drug abuse in the United States: the
bi-annual Household Survey of Drug Abuse and the annual High
School Senior Survey, both sponsored by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA). The Household survey sample includes 5,000
people 12 years of age or older, living in households across the
country. The High School Senior survey questions approximately
17,000 high school seniors. These surveys have been criticized
because they do not include information from those populations
that are frequently involved with drugs, high school dropouts and
people without residences. To compensate for this deficiency, it
has been proposed that these surveys oversample groups thought to
be heavy users of drugs. </p>

<p>While these surveys provide estimates of the extent of drug
abuse, they do not gather important data, such as the price and
quantity of drugs purchased. Such information is crucial for
effective organized crime and drug enforcement policy planning,
because it would provide information concerning the effects of
certain enforcement actions on drug purchasing/using behavior.
NIDA should amend these surveys to include questions about drug
purchases. To the extent possible, they should also be designed
to determine the sources of the funds used to finance drug
purchases. Such data may be crucial to effective prevention
education planning. </p>

<p>NIDA provides two additional data bases of drug use in this
area. The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) collects data
concerning drug-related emergency room visits and deaths. These
statistics are based on reports gathered by NIDA from one-sixth
of the country's emergency rooms and two-thirds of the medical
examiners' offices. NIDA collects information about drug users in
treatment through the Client Oriented Data Acquisition Process
(CODAP). Formerly, all States were required to provide such data
as a condition of Federal assistance. However, since the
institution of block grants to partially fund State drug programs
in 1982, the Federal government has not been able to compel
participation in CODAP, and the number of participating States
has shrunk to approximately 15. Because of the importance of this
treatment data, the Federal government should again require
participation in CODAP. </p>

<p>Much data concerning drug trafficking is gathered by the
11-member National Narcotics Intelligence Consumer Committee
(NNICC) and reported annually in the Narcotics Intelligence
Estimates (NIE). This data includes estimates of the amount of
drugs produced and entering the United States, trafficking
patterns, and prices and purity of drugs. Although the NIE claims
to be &quot;the most comprehensive assessment prepared for the
Federal Government on the worldwide illicit drug situation in
1984,&quot; the report also states that, &quot;[b]ecause of gaps
in some of the data used to derive the estimates, there is a high
degree of uncertainty to the resulting estimates.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1983 NNICC prepared a report analyzing the methodologies
used in preparing drug estimates. The report concluded that NNICC
estimates are not timely, with estimates generally 18-30 months
out of date; there is insufficient data concerning the price and
potency of drugs, in part because of inadequate input from State
and local sources; and estimates of the total retail value of
drugs is an imprecise measure, which should be replaced by a
better measurement of final drug sales. In addition, NNICC's
methodology has been criticized as &quot;analysis by
negotiation,&quot; with final estimates resulting from a
bargaining process among the member agencies. Complaints about
the reliability of NIE data also result from the fact that NNICC
does not publish the background data used to develop the
estimates. </p>

<p>Another important set of data in the drug field is the
estimate of the results of drug law enforcement, including the
amount of drugs and property seized, and the numbers of arrests
and convictions and sentences imposed on drug violators. A
significant problem in generating reliable statistics in this
area is the lack of a centralized system for collection. Because
many agencies often are involved in the same case, the amount of
drugs seized and other information may be reported by each
agency. According to the National Drug enforcement Policy Board, </p>

<p>One of the principal problems encountered by the Federal
Government in its efforts to gauge the effectiveness of its
overall drug law enforcement program has been the lack of
centralized statistical information on Federal drug seizures . .
. Because of an undetermined amount of double and triple
counting, reliable statistics on total Federal drug seizures are
not available. </p>

<p>In apparent response to this problem the 1984 National
Strategy called on the Drug Enforcement Administration to develop
and maintain a centralized system for statistics concerning
Federal drug seizures. </p>

<p>As discussed throughout this report, asset forfeiture programs
are an extremely promising source of funding for anti-drug
efforts. Unfortunately, the availability and reliability of
information about non-drug assets seized by all levels of
government is hampered by the same double counting,
decentralization, and inconsistent data gathering methodologies
described above. Although the Department of Justice Asset
Forfeiture Office was created to maintain centralized information
on forfeited assets, the office is still in the process of
developing statistics for total Federal assets forfeited. A study
of State and local officials found that more than one-half of
those surveyed could not estimate the value of property and cash
obtained through forfeiture. State and local governments which
have not already done so should establish asset management
systems for the disposition of forfeited assets to provide
accurate estimates of their value. </p>

<p>Drug Supply Intelligence </p>

<p>With regard to intelligence concerning drug supplies, this
Commission is encouraged by what appears to be a growing
commitment to effective information-gathering. A number of
agencies have reported confidentially to this Commission that
both their funding and priority determinations are giving greater
weight to effective intelligence programs. </p>

<p>Intelligence efforts in this area take different forms,
depending on the topic to which they are directed. All are
subject to the two classic categories of information gathering:
human intelligence, referring to data gathered from human
informants, and technical collection, gathered by such means as
surveillance flights and satellites. In the area of crop
eradication, the lead agency is the State Department's Bureau of
International Narcotics Matters, supported by other members of
our country teams. Issues here include crop conditions, host
country political and military capabilities, and the role, if
any, of groups, including insurgents, opposing eradication
efforts. </p>

<p>Interdiction efforts require tactical intelligence concerning
specific drug movements, such as the identities of those
involved, shipment techniques, vessel and aircraft
identification, routes, and schedules. Also required is
&quot;strategic&quot; information, such as shifts in processing
and staging locations or in transshipment techniques. The current
exclusion of the Customs Service from foreign intelligence
gathering, mandated by the 1973 reorganization plan, particularly
needs to be re-examined. Strategic and tactical intelligence are
critical for border interdiction. Therefore the Commission
proposes that the Customs Service be integrated into the foreign
intelligence process of the Drug Enforcement Administration, to
the maximum extent permitted by the Reorganization Plan currently
in effect. </p>

<p>Because international drug trafficking organizations
frequently locate components of their operations within U.S.
borders, domestic investigations and prosecutions are often
dependent upon effective international intelligence gathering to
supplement such domestic techniques as legal electronic
surveillance and development of informants. </p>

<p>Effective international intelligence collection and
dissemination is not necessarily a highly sophisticated process.
On the contrary, it can consist of information as simple as
providing the names of suspected traffickers known to the Drug
Enforcement Administration to the State Department to ensure that
consular officers do not issue U.S. visas to such persons, or
that issuance be on a controlled basis to assist the
investigative work of DEA. It is encouraging that the National
Drug Enforcement Policy Board, pursuant to the Foreign Relations
Authorization Act for 1986 and 1987, has been directed to compile
a list of such traffickers and prepare guidelines for
inter-agency sharing of that information. </p>

<p>In the area of more sophisticated drug-related intelligence
work DEA and the intelligence community are currently playing
leading roles. The former has recently expanded its foreign
detail by ten percent, and additional expansion is prevented by
lack of funding. This matter deserves careful consideration by
both Congress and the Executive Branch. In addition, the
capabilities of DEA agents presently stationed in foreign
locations are unduly and unnecessarily hampered by the
&quot;Mansfield Amendment&quot; to the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961, which restricts their activities to a secondary role. As
part of a new expression of determination to combat international
drug trafficking, the amendment should be repealed. </p>

<p>The intelligence community is not burdened by any such
ill-conceived restriction. On the contrary, with regard to
international narcotics trafficking, its mandate, found in
Executive Order 12333, is clear, direct, and sweeping: </p>

<p>1.4 The Intelligence Community. The agencies within the
Intelligence Community shall, in accordance with applicable
United States law and with the other provisions of this Order,
conduct intelligence activities necessary for the conduct of
foreign relations and the protection of the national security of
the United States, including: </p>

<p>(c) Collection of information concerning, and the conduct of
activities to protect against, intelligence activities directed
against the United States, international terrorist and
international narcotics activities, and other hostile activities
directed against the United States by foreign powers,
organizations, persons, and their agents. </p>

<p>Although the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has in the past
been criticized for failing to give sufficient priority to drug
trafficking, the Commission is satisfied that the agency is
currently placing suitable emphasis on the issue. This is due, in
part, to the necessary Executive direction now being given to the
intelligence community, and in part to the growing recognition
throughout the government that drug trafficking in many forms and
in many locations has grown to become a national security
concern, transcending the traditional drug-related health and law
enforcement concerns, as discussed in this report. To complement
this effort, additional options are available and should be
pursued. </p>

<p>First, consistent with the direction now being provided to the
intelligence community, the Department of State should vigorously
pursue a program of educating its own foreign-based personnel to
the importance being given to drug-related intelligence and to
the critical need for State Department support for such efforts.
This appears to have been less than entirely adequate in all
instances. Second, the CIA's operational capabilities should be
fully explored to determine how the infrastructure of drug
trafficking organizations can be disrupted, consistent with the
concerns expressed in Executive Order 12333 and elsewhere.
Finally, the CIA's considerable research and development
capabilities should be used to develop additional means for
furthering efforts directed at international drug traffickers. </p>

<p>In connection with these contributions by the intelligence
community, it is encouraging to note the rapid evolution of a
cooperative relationship between the intelligence and law
enforcement communities. This is evidenced by the pertinent
language of Executive Order 12333, which provides that: </p>

<p>1.7 Senior Officials of the Intelligence Community. The heads
of departments and agencies with organizations in the
Intelligence Community or the heads of such organizations, as
appropriate, shall: </p>

<p>(g) Participate in the development of procedures approved by
the Attorney General governing production and dissemination of
intelligence resulting from criminal narcotics intelligence
activities abroad, if their departments, agencies, or
organizations have intelligence responsibilities for foreign or
domestic narcotics production and trafficking. </p>

<p>This direction is complemented by the inclusion of a
representative of the CIA on the Coordinating Group of the
National Drug Enforcement Policy Board. </p>

<p>Defense Capabilities </p>

<p>The intelligence community is not the only available source of
drug-related intelligence. The Department of Defense has a wide
range of facilities, equipment, and operations, which lend
themselves to effective participation. Although such a role is
most frequently discussed in connection with interdiction
operations near the U.S. border, intelligence-gathering
opportunities for Defense Department components exist much
farther afield. Like their counterparts in the interdiction area,
such efforts may be subject to Defense Department directives and
priorities, which in turn rely on a changeable definition of
&quot;national security.&quot; Nevertheless, if as a matter of
national policy, the military view of national security draws
closer to that of the intelligence community, as expressed in
Executive Order 12333, the potential for military drug-related
intelligence-gathering is profound. Because of the connection
between some drug trafficking organizations and terrorist or
insurgent groups, whatever assets are currently in place or in
planning for intelligence-gathering regarding terrorism or
insurgency could just as well function in connection with drug
traffickers. </p>

<p>Intelligence-gathering in source and transshipment countries
would be particularly effective in the interdiction effort, in
the opinion of former SOUTHCOM Commanding General Paul F. Gorman:
</p>

<p>I can't stress enough that it seems to me that the easy way to
operate on the [drug smuggling] pilots is down at the other end.
He is at the other end of his communications tether where the
airfields are much more primitive, where he is dependent on these
cartels and it's easier to penetrate. </p>

<p>Because they occur outside of U.S. territory, such operations
would not violate the Posse Comitatus Act. In addition, with an
expanded definition of national security, such as that manifest
in Executive Order 12333, the Economy Act would not be an
obstacle. Such an expanded intelligence-gathering role is a
desirable course of action for the Department of Defense. The
Commanding Officers of Unified Commands should be given maximum
flexibility in deploying their forces. </p>

<p>Another change in our application of military assets to
drug-related intelligence is much less sweeping in concept, but
nevertheless appears very useful. That is the inclusion of Coast
Guard officers in our Defense Attache programs in drug source and
transit countries. This Commission has been advised that such a
program is in process and encourages the agencies involved to
pursue this program with all due speed. </p>

<p>Allied governments in affected areas could significantly
enhance the intelligence operations of our own military units.
Such activities already under way and worthy of note include a
regional radio communications network being set up among the drug
enforcement authorities of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and
Venezuela. This network is designed to give these countries the
opportunity to coordinate drug enforcement strategies and work
closely together in confronting the drug trafficking threat
common to all. Agreements signed very recently by Brazil,
Venezuela, and Colombia allow these countries to initiate joint
investigations on their common borders, call for periodic
meetings between drug enforcement police, exchange intelligence,
and solve common problems. Although such efforts must contend
with the endemic problems of corruption and organizational and
national rivalries, they are a step in the right direction. To
the extent that United States assistance can contribute to the
elimination of corruption and other systemic problems, such
assistance should be provided to promote these programs. </p>

<p>All Source Intelligence and Operations Center </p>

<p>Data collection is but one phase of a complete intelligence
operation. To be effective collection should be followed by
thorough and timely analysis and dissemination. This Commission
therefore concludes that this Nation's anti-drug intelligence
efforts should be built upon an all-source intelligence and
operations center. Such a concept is described briefly above in
connection with interdiction efforts. EPIC and NNBIS together
provide an existing core upon which such a center could be built.
EPIC has demonstrated the feasibility of joint agency operations,
and NNBIS has shown that interagency operational coordination,
particularly involving military components, is well within
capabilities. </p>

<p>As a component of a comprehensive intelligence program, such a
center should be designed to collect drug-related intelligence
from the broadest base possible, including those sovereign
nations that will provide consistent, timely data on a
cooperative basis. In this regard, it is encouraging to note that
Latin American drug enforcement agencies are reported to be
planning to establish a regional intelligence center in a
strategic location, such as Panama, in the near future. Because
analysis should be as complete as possible, such a center should
include not only supply and transit-related intelligence, but
also counterpart demand data, including information on such
topics as drug-related deaths and emergency room admissions. This
will allow a complete picture of drug distribution from one end
of the chain to the other. This center would assume the
functions, including issuing annual reports, currently undertaken
by the National Narcotics Intelligence Consumer Committee
(NNICC). In addition, it should integrate all financial data
currently available to agencies of the Federal government, to
enable analysts to complete their knowledge about the drug-money
cycle whenever possible. </p>

<p>To be consistent with the rest of our national effort, such a
center should be under the general direction of the Policy Board
or its delegate, with the Vice President retaining primary
responsibility for management and coordination of the information
related specifically to interdiction. Such a facility would thus
coordinate the collection, analysis, and dissemination of
intelligence, covering every topic from production and
cultivation (including related political issues) to domestic
enforcement and detailed patterns of domestic consumption. It
would also provide the necessary centralized data base for
thorough inter-agency coordination of operations. Given the
sensitivity of many of its sources and the data received
therefrom, the functions and output of such a center would, of
course, require physical and communications security. The
resources and expertise of the National Security Agency with
regard to operational and communications security is an extremely
valuable national asset, which should be exploited to the fullest
extent possible in this connection. As this Commission has sought
to demonstrate repeatedly, drug traffickers have regularly and
successfully sought to penetrate law enforcement communications.
The equipment available for such purposes is readily available.
Communications security thus requires very careful attention in
the planning and design of all anti-drug operations and
facilities.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter VI Part 2: Interdiction </h2>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Our National Strategy consists of five &quot;major
elements,&quot; each of which in turn is comprised of numerous
programs and strategies. Interdiction, just one of these
sub-components, presently consumes one-third of the entire
Federal drug abuse outlay for the fiscal year. Measured just in
terms of outlays designated for law enforcement activities,
interdiction's portion swells to almost one-half of the Federal
funds being spent to combat drug abuse. By Commission
calculation, Federal funds devoted to interdiction have increased
100 percent over the last five years. </p>

<p>Despite this massive dedication of funds, drugs of primarily
foreign origin - cocaine, heroin, and marijuana - continue to be
widely available in this country. Many observers, including some
leading drug enforcement officials, readily acknowledge that
interdiction can only serve a limited role in increasing risks to
smugglers while this government pursues other programs. Frank
Monastero, former Assistant Administrator for Operations of the
Drug Enforcement Administration, summed up this view in a recent
interview: </p>

<p>[Interdiction] is important, but it is the least effective
thing you can do . . . it's like the patrolman on the beat . . .
It is preventing [some drugs] from getting into the trafficking,
and that's something. But we can continue that ad infinitum. If
we don't do something at the source or don't do something before
that or don't do something at the end of the trail in the
prevention area, we will never change the situation. </p>

<p>It is the view of this Commission that interdiction is not
going to end drug use or availability in this country. It will,
however, continue to discourage some potential smugglers. This
deterrent effect is often overlooked or denied by many critics,
but not by smugglers themselves. According to Adler B. Seal, an
experienced drug smuggling pilot, in response to a question
concerning the difficulty of recruiting smuggling pilots: </p>

<p>Well, it used to be easy. However, now it has become a little
less attractive for some of the younger pilots. Some of the older
pilots, as myself, have been indicted. </p>

<p>We've been cognizant of law enforcement techniques and the
improvements in it; and the younger pilots are seeing the
newspaper reports of the older pilots and the amount of time that
they are being convicted on and serving, and it's not as
attractive a proposition as it used to be. </p>

<p>Successful interdiction not only discourages some new members
from joining smuggling enterprises, but also encourages some
already in the field to get out of it. This was confirmed by the
firsthand experience of smuggler Seal: </p>

<p>I think that the more flights that are interdicted, the word
gets around. </p>

<p>For instance, I have absolutely - or had in my capacity - no
desire whatsoever to go into and would do anything to stay out of
the south Florida area simply due to the fact that that is where
the concentrated interdiction efforts are being made due to the
Vice Presidential Task Force, which has been highly publicized
and which has taken its toll on the paranoia of the drug
smuggler. </p>

<p>It also appears to this Commission to be consistent with the
view of the Commissioner of Customs, William von Raab: </p>

<p>We are always asked what is a good measure of success against
smuggling. It is always quoted in terms of how much we seize. </p>

<p>I have always maintained that a good measure of success is to
reach a point at which a pilot doesn't want to fly into the
United States anymore; and I have always suggested that there may
be a percentage. </p>

<p>For example, if he has a one-out-of-ten chance of getting
caught, he might run in; but certainly if he had a
nine-out-of-ten chance of being caught, he's not going to do it. </p>

<p>In summary, this Commission recognizes that interdiction is
and should continue to be a vital component of our National
strategy, as a complement to other approaches to reduce drug
supply. Any analysis that defines success in the area of
interdiction as apprehending all, or nearly all, smuggled drugs
is unrealistic and counter-productive. To the extent that is a
very costly approach, additional expenditures must be weighed
very carefully, particularly if they have the effect of reducing
funds available for other efforts to reduce supply and demand.
There are, however, improvements to our interdiction efforts
which can be made without any significant increase in funding.
These steps, which generally involve reordering of priorities or
redefinition of interagency responsibilities, are discussed
below. </p>

<p>It is crucial to note that the single most important need in
the interdiction field is leadership. If innovation and increased
commitment are to be pursued successfully and expeditiously, both
by foreign governments and agencies of our own, a strong leader
orchestrating a single comprehensive plan is the key. That role
to date has been played by the Vice President, and it is one in
which he should continue. The weight of his office has produced
results when other officials might have been ignored. While the
National Drug Enforcement Policy Board necessarily includes
several Cabinet-level officers, they serve as peers. Only the
Vice President brings to the interdiction effort sufficient rank
to lead them. His central role should be preserved and promoted
within the context of the National Drug Enforcement Policy
Board's leadership in drug enforcement. Recognition by the Board
of the Vice President's leadership in interdiction activities
holds the promise of singularly promoting success in that key
area, preserving the momentum and continuity of existing
interagency interdiction efforts, and putting to rest the
confusion that has already begun to surface concerning the Vice
President's relationship to the Board. </p>

<p>Air Interdiction </p>

<p>The United States Customs Service has the lead responsibility
for air interdiction. To combat drug smugglers, some of whom have
the most sophisticated and expensive communications and
navigational equipment available today, Customs has increased its
airborne capabilities significantly in the recent past. At the
time of this report, the Service had just received $11 million in
a supplemental fiscal year 1985 appropriation for its air
operations, bringing the agency's total fiscal year budget for
air operations to $55.4 million. Customs' most significant need,
apart from more aircraft and more sophisticated electronics, is
the support of other Federal agencies with related jurisdictions.
</p>

<p>One example of the need for support is on the diplomatic
front. Customs has for some time found itself frustrated by its
inability to pursue suspected smuggler aircraft into Mexican
airspace after detection on the American side of the border.
Although this has been the subject of numerous diplomatic
discussions, there has been little progress to date. Giving this
matter an extremely high priority in our bilateral negotiations
with Mexico is the type of assistance another agency, in this
case the state Department, can and should provide to Customs in
recognition of the critical importance of the fight against drug
smuggling. </p>

<p>Another Customs' Services critical need is intelligence, both
tactical and strategic. While &quot;cold hits&quot; -
apprehension of smugglers in a random, uninformed basis - have an
important role to play in deterring smugglers by their very
randomness, intelligence is the key to effective interdiction.
According to former Drug Enforcement Administrator Francis
Mullen, every major seizure of drugs from South America made by
his agency has been made on the basis of prior intelligence, and
it is no less critical to the Customs Service. While the topic of
intelligence-gathering is the subject of a separate analysis in
this report, it is important to note in connection with this
discussion on inter-agency support that Customs and the Drug
Enforcement Administration have made considerable progress in the
area of information sharing. Customs has for some time had an
analyst stationed in DEA's Office of Intelligence, and a program
is currently underway to place Customs intelligence analysts in
country teams abroad to analyze data gathered by DEA. This
program should be pursued aggressively. Simultaneously, the
Customs Service should scrutinize its Customs Attache program to
determine to what extent it can play a larger role in
intelligence-gathering concerning smugglers. With its close
liaison with host government customs officials, this program may
be of particular significance with regard to smuggling involving
containerized and other commercial cargo. As interdiction
capabilities improve in the areas of pleasure craft and general
aviation, it is almost certain that commercial cargo will be used
increasingly for concealing illicit drug shipments. This has
already been observed in some cases. Such a Customs effort would
be complemented by the private sector initiatives Customs has
been able to bring about, such as the agreements now in effect
with the Airline Transport and International Airline Transport
Associations. </p>

<p>An active intelligence gathering role for Customs is now
blocked by the 1973 Reorganization Plan. The current recognition
by Customs and DEA of the former's need for time-sensitive
intelligence is of vital importance however, and should be
actively cultivated by the two agencies and the Policy Board.
That this would require modification or elimination of certain
provisions of the 1973 Reorganization Plan should not be an
obstacle. </p>

<p>The area of inter-agency support currently in need of the most
attention is the relationship between the Customs Service and the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The latter, which has
primary jurisdiction over entry into United States air space,
maintains a number of programs, which lend themselves to support
of Customs operations. While the FAA has to date given
significant support to Customs in a number of instances, more is
needed. To this end, the Customs Service has recently proposed
omnibus legislation, currently entitled the Customs Enforcement
Act of 1985, which contains provisions that address such
sensitive topics as restricted entry points and minimum altitudes
for air entry. Among other things, this Act would require all
vessels and aircraft entering the United States to report
immediately for Customs inspection, and would increase the fines
for failure to report entry. Fines would also be substantially
increased for smuggling controlled substances, and such
violations would be punishable by imprisonment. All assets seized
by Customs, including planes, vessels, and cash, would be subject
to forfeiture. The Act would prohibit airdrops to vessels, make
it unlawful to operate an aircraft without lights, and prohibit
the installation of all illegal fuel tanks in planes. In
addition, commercial carriers would be subject to more stringent
regulations under the Act. While this legislation may be
unpopular with private aviation, it is a collection of important
anti-smuggling measures which go directly to some of the most
frequently encountered drug smuggling techniques. It is worthy of
support. </p>

<p>Similarly, proposals advanced by both Customs and DEA that
aircraft identification numbers, now required to be twelve inches
high and displayed on the fuselage or tail, be displayed on an
upper and a lower wing surface as well are entirely consistent
with anti-smuggling requirements. DEA pilots have been fired upon
from the ground as they tried to fly low enough to read tail
numbers. Although the FAA has stated that an increase in required
number size has no &quot;aviation safety basis,&quot; it is this
Commission's position that needless exposure of Federal agents to
hostile fire should be considered an &quot;aviation safety&quot;
concern sufficient to justify remedial action. Again, reports
that a change in required number size or location would be very
unpopular with the general aviation community seem frivolous in
the context of issues as grave as those under discussion here.
There are a number of additional aviation-related proposals being
advanced by Customs today, concerning such matters as pre-filing
of &quot;border flight plans,&quot; advanced notice of entry into
U.S. air space, and improvements in pilot identification
certificates, which appear to this Commission to be worthy of
adoption, absent some compelling opposition. </p>

<p>There are other promising areas for Customs/FAA cooperation.
Customs reports, for example, that the FAA, in undertaking its
long-term buildup of the approach radar system, is working
closely with Customs to accommodate the latter's needs. This is
to be encouraged, particularly by the Policy Board, which has
both Customs and the FAA on its Coordinating Group. </p>

<p>One legal issue which would benefit from careful analysis by
the Board is the extent to which current asset forfeiture
provisions need revision to enable seizure of aircraft and other
equipment which is rented or leased by traffickers for the
purpose of avoiding forfeiture. </p>

<p>Another area worthy of study is the extent to which Customs'
air interdiction capabilities could be enhanced by Coast Guard
aviation components. Although such a concept might be contrary to
existing understandings, it would be a grave omission if
substantial Coast Guard aviation assets were overlooked,
particularly at a time when fiscal considerations threaten the
Customs air operations budget. </p>

<p>Maritime Operations </p>

<p>In the area of maritime interdiction, the Coast Guard serves
as lead agency. Its success has been remarkable and is limited
only by shortages in resources. New tactics and innovative forms
of assistance by the Navy have significantly improved the Coast
Guard's capabilities. There is no question that not only maritime
traffickers but air smugglers as well are intimidated by the
seaborne detection capabilities of Coast Guard vessels. Inasmuch
as the most critical limitation on Coast Guard capabilities is
the lack of budgeted resources, the single most pressing concern
is the augmentation of the Coast Guard budget to permit more
extensive participation in interdiction operations. A proposal,
which has surfaced annually but to no avail as yet, is the
imposition of user fees for various Coast Guard services now
provided to the boating community gratis. As with the aviation
community in connection with the FAA discussed above, there is
considerable opposition to maritime measures that would
inconvenience the user community or cost it money. However, given
the inescapable facts of the drug invasion this country is
experiencing, the nominal costs of various user fees would seem
to be a small price for boaters to pay as their contribution to
what must be seen as a national effort to defeat a deadly enemy. </p>

<p>In-shore operations of the Customs Service bolster Coast Guard
maritime interdiction operations. Having received over $12
million for maritime operations in its fiscal year 1985
supplemental appropriation, Customs has begun to get fast, state
of the art pursuit boats in the water off the coast of Florida.
These have been used to great effect, and more such craft should
be deployed. </p>

<p>One innovation for which the Customs Service and the
leadership of the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System
(NNBIS) are to be commended is the highly effective integration
of State and local authorities in the recent operation &quot;Blue
Lightning.&quot; It is clear and has been stressed throughout
this report that comprehensive, coordinated multi-agency
operations are absolutely essential to effective anti-drug
programs. On the Federal level, this typically means
&quot;horizontal integration,&quot; i.e., the careful combination
of equal Federal agencies. Blue Lightning is a fine example of
the equally important concept of &quot;vertical
integration,&quot; the well-planned and complementary cooperation
of Federal, State, and local resources aimed at a specific
trafficking activity. The Customs Service and NNBIS are
rightfully proud of this accomplishment and are encouraged to
pursue similar successes in operations to come. </p>

<p>Consolidated Efforts </p>

<p>The evolution of interdiction in recent years has been in the
direction of consolidation of intelligence and operations. This
is a trend characteristic of anti-drug efforts generally, and it
is a proper response to the breadth of the drug smuggling
situation. In the area of interdiction, the most prominent joint
efforts in addition to NNBIS are the National Drug Enforcement
Policy Board (the Board) and the El Paso Intelligence Center
(EPIC). All are described in detail elsewhere in this report. </p>

<p>The following is a proposed realignment of these
organizations, based on this Commission's review. </p>

<p>First, our proposal recognizes the leadership role of the
Board. That important topic is the subject of a separate analysis
in this report. Within the Board and as a part of its coordinated
program, we propose the combination of the functions of EPIC and
NNBIS into a single, all-source intelligence facility. In the
critical early stages of designing and implementing such an
operation, the Vice President's leadership will be invaluable.
The combined intelligence center will incorporate the input of
all intelligence-gathering components at the Federal level,
including those sources already feeding into EPIC and NNBIS, as
well as new sources still to be developed, as outlined below. </p>

<p>The present duplication between the various functions
performed by EPIC and NNBIS has been acknowledged by such
authorities as David Westrate, Assistant Administrator for
Operations of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the parent
agency of EPIC. Although it is true there are certain functions
being performed by each of the two activities, which are not
duplicated by the other, this should not prevent effective
integration of their functions. Everywhere in the current Federal
response, we find a movement toward consolidation and
coordination. Intelligence and planning should not be exceptions.
</p>

<p>A combined all-source intelligence center would require at
least two features not found in either NNBIS or EPIC. One is a
physically secure headquarters facility. EPIC is presently
located in a private office building in El Paso. It has neither
the space nor the necessary physical security to accommodate the
comprehensive input advocated here. NNBIS headquarters is in the
Old Executive Office Building in downtown Washington, and its
regional facilities are located in various Federal buildings
around the country. While such quarters might provide adequate
physical security, they are not equipped to provide for the scope
of the proposed undertaking. A secure facility with sufficient
physical dimensions is crucial, as are secure communications with
participating agency and military headquarters. Ft. Bliss, Texas,
is a potential site, as it provides the necessary physical
security and is located near the present EPIC facility. This and
similar locations should be considered. </p>

<p>The second requirement of the facility proposed here is
enhanced intelligence input. Thorough, &quot;real-time&quot;
intelligence is absolutely vital to effective interdiction, and
it is almost as critically important to other areas of
enforcement operations as well. The importance of intelligence is
such that it is treated as a separate topic below. At this point,
it is sufficient to note that the design of a new center must
from the very outset include the most thorough provisions for the
maximum intelligence contribution permitted by law and physical
and technological capabilities. </p>

<p>Military Support for Interdiction </p>

<p>Perhaps the single most valuable development in the area of
interdiction in recent years has been the assistance rendered by
components of the Department of Defense. Such activities were
constrained somewhat by the Posse Comitatus Act until certain
exemptions to the Act were passed in December 1981. Since that
time the assistance rendered by the military has grown
dramatically. In calendar year 1984 the military provided
assistance to interdiction efforts worth $100 million by Pentagon
calculations. Such assistance is typically in the form of aerial
surveillance, transport of enforcement personnel, and loans of
equipment and personnel as permitted by law. </p>

<p>The role of the Defense Department has become steadily more
active, more innovative, and more flexible. The quality and
quantity of such assistance, however, continue to be limited by
the constraints found in the Posse Comitatus exemptions: military
assistance to law enforcement cannot include direct participation
by military personnel in arrest or seizure activities, and it can
be provided only if it does not affect military preparedness.
Furthermore, law enforcement authorities will be required by the
Economy Act to reimburse the Department of Defense for assistance
provided, unless such assistance is incidental to existing
military operations or provides &quot;equivalent training.&quot;
Reimbursement may also be waived, if such waiver does not
adversely impact military preparedness. In this regard, as in
other, the Department of Defense has been increasingly flexible.
One example of this is the expanded delegation of authority to
waive reimbursement, as found in the January 2, 1985,
modifications to the applicable Departmental directive. Another
is the increasingly positive liaison role being played by the
Department of Defense Task Force on Drug Enforcement. </p>

<p>There are grounds for concern that the military's role
continues to be too narrowly defined. There appears to be a
fundamental misconception at the very top of the Department
concerning the permissible scope of the military's role. Writing
to the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee in June
1985, Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger stated that direct
military participation in drug seizures outside United States
territory would do violence to &quot;the historic separation
between military and civilian spheres of activity . . . one of
the most fundamental principles of American democracy. This
Commission has been unable to find the basis for such a
&quot;fundamental principle&quot; of co-equal &quot;spheres of
activity.&quot; The fact is that the military, rather than being
a parallel entity, has traditionally been subject to the
direction of the civilian &quot;sphere.&quot; Indeed, the
military's Commander-in-Chief is a civilian. The Posse Comitatus
Act does no more than prohibit use of military forces to enforce
civilian laws on the territory of the United States. The
Constitution was in existence for approximately a century before
such a law was passed by Congress. The Act has been amended once
since then, and it can be amended again if appropriate.
Furthermore, there is nothing in the laws of the United States
forbidding an active enforcement role by the military outside
United States territory, except the requirement of reimbursement.
This in turn hinges upon the definition of &quot;military
preparedness.&quot; However, nowhere in the debate over the
military's role in this area has this Commission found a
discussion of this term. The definition of the military's role
has been left to the military itself, which, through the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, has declared that the military shall be prepared
to serve national security by providing: </p>

<p>a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostile or
destructive action from within or without, overt or covert. </p>

<p>As described in Chapter 3 of this report, international drug
traffickers have regularly formed alliances with insurgent and
terrorist forces in certain countries. In a few instances these
alliances may actually threaten friendly governments. In many
more countries such a combination at least drains resources from
constructive goals and inhibits efforts to build or maintain a
stable democracy. Even where the threat is more remote, it is
clear that the smuggling techniques in use are the very same ones
that are or could be used to move personnel, weapons, and other
supplies for insurgent groups. For these reasons alone, the
activities of traffickers should bring them squarely within the
national security concerns of the Department of Defense. This
fact has already been recognized by the Vice President, who has
stated clearly that &quot;success against drug smuggling is
intimately tied to the continuation of freedom and democracy in
the hemisphere.&quot; Recognition of this fact would permit the
Defense Department much greater latitude in conducting military
operations aimed at disrupting trafficking organizations.
Examples of such programs include a wide range of activities,
such as expanded and focused intelligence gathering, security
assistance to receptive host governments, expanded deployment of
tethered aerostat radar sites, and joint research and development
between military and law enforcement agencies to provide greater
operation compatibility. </p>

<p>Beyond threats to friendly democracies, international drug
traffickers should be considered a threat to our national
security because they comprise a direct attack on the physical
and social well-being of our country. The costs of this invasion,
which comes by air, sea, and land, is thoroughly documented in
this report. Recognition of this attack as a &quot;. . .
destructive action from without . . .&quot; which is within the
meaning of the Joint Chiefs' definition, would bring the
Department of Defense squarely into the war in which we presently
find ourselves. This may be further than present policy makers
are prepared to go, but it is surely time to bring the issue into
the debate so that it can be decided on the basis of what is
actually permitted or proscribed by the laws and Constitution of
the United States. </p>

<p>Domestic Investigations and Prosecutions </p>

<p>Domestic investigative and prosecutive activity is only one
facet of drug law enforcement. As with all other approaches
designed to reduce the supply of drugs, proper assessment of
their effectiveness requires that realistic goals be established.
As this report has demonstrated, it is unrealistic to expect that
domestic law enforcement alone will solve, or even substantially
reduce, the Nation's drug abuse problem. Rather, its goal must be
a more limited one: to increase the arrests and successful
prosecutions of drug traffickers, whether they be importers,
wholesalers, or retailers, and those who assist them, including
pilots, bankers, and attorneys, and the forfeiture of their
properties accumulated from criminal activity. </p>

<p>The attainment of this objective would contribute to the
ultimate national policy goal of eliminating drug use in several
ways. First, it would directly reduce the supply of drugs by
removing from the illicit drug market those drugs that are seized
along with the arrested traffickers. Second, it would reduce the
supply of drugs indirectly by disrupting the networks that make
it possible to distribute drugs efficiently. Finally, the
traffickers would likely raise the price of their product to
reflect the increased risks, which theoretically should cause a
reduction in the overall consumption of drugs. </p>

<p>In a recent study prepared by the Rand Corporation the authors
concluded that prevention programs, not intensified domestic law
enforcement, were the best approach to control adolescent drug
use. The Commission agrees with the Rand Corporation's
conclusions concerning adolescent drug use and believes that they
are equally valid with respect to adult drug use. However, such
conclusions should not be interpreted as a call for a reduction
in domestic law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking.
Without effective domestic law enforcement, the drug abuse
problem, and its concomitant organized crime effects, would be
immeasurably worse. </p>

<p>Although domestic law enforcement has a limited, albeit
essential, role to play in the national effort against drug
abuse, the Commission has concluded, on the basis of its
investigations, hearings, and study, that changes in focus and
attitudes and a rearrangement of priorities must be undertaken to
achieve the maximum effect of domestic law enforcement. Before
discussing these matters, it is necessary first to address two
fundamental issues: (1) Do organized crime policy and drug abuse
policy conflict? and (2) What, if any, should be the level of
interaction and cooperation between Federal law enforcement
agencies on the one hand and State and local agencies on the
other? </p>

<p>Professor Mark H. Moore, a former Special Assistant to the
Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, has
described the objectives of U.S. organized crime policy as
follows: </p>

<p>[T]o suppress the provision of illegal goods and services that
constitute the core of organized crime, to prevent the violence
and corruption that is more characteristic of organized crime
groups than other kinds of criminal activity, and to prevent the
emergence of very large, durable organizations with well
developed capacities for violence and corruption. </p>

<p>This Commission believes that the Nation's drug policy must
have as its goal the elimination of illegal drug use. Domestic
law enforcement contributes to this goal by reducing the supply
of drug in the illegal market and by increasing the prices of
drugs that remain available for purchase. It has been suggested
that the pursuit of the Nation's drug policy, without regard for
its impact on organized crime, may exacerbate the country's
organized crime problem by enriching organized crime groups,
eliminating their competitors, and encouraging trafficking
organizations to become organized crime groups if they are not
already. Although agreeing that such a concern is legitimate,
this Commission has concluded that drug and organized crime
policies do not inherently conflict. Indeed, there is
substantial, if not complete, overlap in the goals of the two
policies because, as the Commission has found, drug trafficking
is a principal activity of organized crime groups. In light of
this, the Commission recommends that targeting high-level
organized-crime trafficking groups, whether they be foreign,
multinational or domestic, should be the top priority of Federal
domestic law enforcement. As Professor Moore has stated: </p>

<p>What is not in conflict, however, is the need of both drug
abuse policy and organized crime policy to develop and use
tactics that are successful in attacking large, entrenched
criminal organizations. This is useful to drug policy, and
essential to organized crime policy. </p>

<p>The Commission is aware that some commentators have criticized
the Federal Government's bias in favor of enforcement against
high-level dealers to the virtual exclusion of lower- or
street-level enforcement. However, the Commission's
recommendation that targeting organized crime trafficking groups
should be the top priority of Federal domestic law enforcement
should not be construed to mean that lower-level enforcement is
not useful and therefore has no place in the Nation's drug
policy. On the contrary, such lower-level enforcement is
essential to achieve the goal of eliminating drug use for several
reasons. As discussed earlier, the arrest of the customers of
drug retailers may result in a direct and immediate reduction in
the demand for drugs. In addition, successful enforcement efforts
directed at lower-level dealers will reduce the supply of illegal
drugs and raise the price of drugs available for purchase, thus
resulting in lower drug consumption. Finally, lower-level
enforcement operations are useful in providing information that
will be invaluable to those involved in investigating high-level
organized crime trafficking groups. The absence of vigorous
lower-level domestic law enforcement could encourage organized
crime groups to remain in drug trafficking, and quite possible
spawn more such groups. High-level enforcement efforts could be
crippled, if not completely undermined, by a lack of a
complementary, lower-level effort. </p>

<p>A fundamental question remains: Which agencies should be
responsible for the various facets of domestic law enforcement?
The investigation of high-level organized crime trafficking
groups, whose activities are generally regional, national or
international in scope, is expensive, time consuming, and
requires special skills and sophisticated tools. The Federal
government, through its agencies, is best equipped to undertake
such investigations. State and local agencies, because of their
unique knowledge of local conditions and expertise in the
required techniques, are more qualified to conduct lower-level
domestic law enforcement, including street operations and
investigations of certain smaller and geographically-restricted
trafficking organizations. </p>

<p>The conclusions and recommendations set forth in the preceding
paragraph are not intended to suggest that Federal domestic law
enforcement and that of State and local agencies should be
completely separate and independent. The drug problem facing the
United States is a national one, and the efforts of all law
enforcement agencies must be coordinated and interrelated to some
extent, if we are to deal successfully with the problem. The
required level of cooperation in some instances may be more than
the routine exchange of drug intelligence or the suppression of
interagency rivalries and jurisdictional disputes. In this
regard, the Commission endorses generally the view expressed
recently by a Federal prosecutor concerning drug enforcement
efforts in New York City: </p>

<p>[O]ne can not compartmentalize the narcotics enforcement
effort, and leave the streets entirely to state and local
enforcement and the conspiracy cases entirely to the federal
government. While each may have a primary area, each must do some
of both. The ideal combination may be some federal prosecution of
state and local arrests, and a significant state and local
participation in joint Task Forces, aimed at dismantling of drug
networks through the conspiracy law. </p>

<p>Examples of successful joint ventures involving Federal, State
and local personnel include the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement
Task Force Program, Operation Pressure Point, and the New York
Drug Enforcement Task Force, which was formed in 1970. These
programs can serve as useful models for any future cooperative
domestic law enforcement arrangements that might be needed. </p>

<p>Federal Domestic Law Enforcement </p>

<p>As a result of its investigation and study, the Commission has
concluded that the tools and techniques needed to permit Federal
law enforcement agents to prosecute their portion of the war
against drug traffickers successfully are for the most part
currently available. The need is not for sweeping new legislative
initiatives but for further changes in attitudes and a greater
commitment to cooperation and coordination among the Federal
agencies involved in drug law enforcement. Balkanization and
jurisdictional disputes between agencies are the most serious
obstacles to success in the struggle against drug trafficking.
The personnel of each Federal agency involved in domestic law
enforcement, from the chief executive to the newest employee,
must understand that their agency alone cannot solve the Nation's
drug problem. Acceptance of this reality will go a long way in
eliminating the destructive competition that in the past has
hampered Federal law enforcement. </p>

<p>As discussed above, the Commission has concluded that the
targeting of high-level organized crime trafficking groups should
be the top priority of Federal drug law enforcement efforts.
Because of the sophistication and complexity of such
organizations and their operations, the Federal response must be
equally sophisticated and complex. The Reagan Administration's
establishment of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force
Program (OCDETF Program) in late 1982 was an attempt to create a
mechanism for attacking high-level organized crime trafficking
groups; by their own account, the multiagency Task Forces,
drawing on the resources of a broad spectrum of Federal, State
and local agencies, have achieved an encouraging degree of
success. The success that has been achieved was not the result of
the development of new techniques but of the efficient use of
existing ones: </p>

<p>The OCDE Task Force Program can lay claim to no new inventions
in the fields of investigative and prosecutorial techniques. It
can, however, be justifiably proud of its creative utilization of
existing tools. </p>

<p>The Commission applauds the OCDETF Program and those who
designed and have implemented it. It strongly favors the
Programs's continuation and expansion, to the extent that it is
desirable and feasible to do so, for several reasons: the Program
has resulted in the elimination of interagency disputes to a
substantial extent; the disruption of large and sophisticated
trafficking groups requires large, efficient and strongly
supported enforcement organizations; and multiagency task forces
are particularly suited to use the Federal conspiracy, Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Continuing Criminal
Enterprise (CCE), and forfeiture statutes to the maximum and
optimum extent possible. In addition, the different investigative
techniques used by the participating agencies increases the
probability of successful infiltration of trafficking
organizations. However, the effectiveness of the OCDETF Program
could be enhanced if the following changes were made. </p>

<p>In creating the OCDETF Program, its designers concluded that
to insure the maximum support of the participating agencies, a
consensus-based decision-making process was necessary. In this
regard, no single agency was designated as the lead Task Force
agency. Although participants in the OCDETF Program have been
able to reduce interagency competition and conflict to a
substantial and significant extent, the Commission believe that
further improvement is both desirable and feasible. Such
improvements would flow naturally from a renewed, unambiguous
commitment to the Program and its goals by participating
agencies. Increased cooperation and coordination might also
result, if DEA or the FBI were designated as the lead Task Force
agency, or if the United States Attorneys were given greater
authority with respect to the operations of the Task Force. The
Commission recommends that those in charge of the OCDETF Program
should consider whether a lead agency should be designated or a
U.S. Attorney be given greater authority to achieve even greater
coordination of effort. </p>

<p>Law enforcement agencies that participate in the OCDETF
Program have other missions in the struggle against drug
trafficking. For this reason, each &quot;agency must balance its
commitment to the Task Force concept with its fundamental
mission. Because the targeting of high-level organized crime
trafficking groups should be the top priority and because the
OCDE Task Forces are the best available devices for infiltrating
and disrupting such groups, the Commission is concerned that, in
allocating manpower and other resources between the program and
other missions, the participating agencies should not shortchange
the Task Forces in any way. The top echelon of each participating
agency must be strongly committed to the OCDETF Program and its
goals and must be actively involved in assuring its success. The
required commitment and involvement are not satisfied by
abdicating responsibility for insuring the success of the program
to those heading field offices. Indifference at the headquarters
level will be reflected eventually in field offices. </p>

<p>To signal their commitment to the program and to encourage
their best agents to participate in it, the top executives of
each participating agency should adopt an unambiguous policy that
salary increases and career advancement within the agency for an
agent who participates in an OCDE Task Force will not be
adversely affected in any way by that participation. Such a
policy would require that the evaluation of an agent assigned to
a Task Force be based not on such criteria as the number of
arrests or cases made or the amount of drugs seized. Evaluations
should assess that agent's qualitative performance in complex
financial and conspiracy cases, which may last more than two
years and which may result in the arrest of few, albeit
high-level and important traffickers. </p>

<p>The OCDETF Program is only one facet of the Federal effort
against drug trafficking. The effective functioning of the other
facets of Federal domestic law enforcement, i.e., Organized Crime
Strike Forces, the South Florida Task Force, the FBI, DEA,
Customs, and U.S. Attorneys, is also essential if the Nation's
drug problem is ever to be contained and eventually eliminated. </p>

<p>That the OCDE Task Forces are and should be primarily
responsible for disrupting high-level organized crime trafficking
groups does not mean that the other Federal efforts should be
devoted to, or focused upon, lower -or street-level traffickers
or purely local drug problems. For the reasons discussed above,
these enforcement concerns are rightfully and almost exclusively
those of State and local law enforcement. However, there will be
cases against organized crime trafficking groups that will be
deemed inappropriate for OCDETF treatment, and these will then
have to be handled by some other Federal agency; this is also
true with respect to large trafficking organizations that are not
organized crime controlled and that may or may not be
multi-jurisdictional. </p>

<p>As a result of its investigation and study, the Commission has
concluded that the non-OCDETF Program segments of Federal
domestic drug law enforcement are for the most part functioning
well and that the variety of investigative techniques that these
agencies bring to the Federal effort to reduce the supply of
drugs is a great benefit. The use of financial expertise,
undercover, sting and reverse sting operations, informants,
electronic and other kinds of surveillance, preselected target
and target of opportunity approaches to initiating
investigations, and buy-bust transactions are all useful ways of
infiltrating trafficking organizations. However, the Commission
is concerned that the healthy competition among enforcement
agencies that the current organizational structure is supposed to
encourage often degenerates into jurisdictional conflicts that
harm the overall Federal effort against traffickers. This will
continue to occur unless top agency officials instill in their
agents and employees the sense that genuine cooperation and
coordination with other agencies are essential to the ultimate
success of the Nation's drug effort. In this regard, the National
Drug Enforcement Policy Board has an important and unique role to
play insuring that healthy and constructive competition does not
become destructive and petty conflict. </p>

<p>The Board could take one important step to eliminate
jurisdictional disputes, as well as to avoid duplication of
investigative efforts and to provide maximum safety to drug
agents. This would be to require the establishment of a system
whereby an agency would file a report with a central reporting
repository, once it has opened an investigation of an individual
believed to be a part of a trafficking operation. If two or more
agencies were investigating the same individual, they would be
notified of that fact, and they would be required to decide,
after negotiations, the best way for conducting the
investigation, a single agency or an ad hoc task force. Such a
system would work at its optimal level only if all law
enforcement agencies, including State and local units,
participated. The Commission believes that such a reporting and
control system is highly desirable and, because of existing
technology, feasible. The Commission also believes that this
system could be incorporated easily into the all-source
intelligence and operations center, recommended elsewhere in this
report. </p>

<p>As result of the 1973 reorganization plan, the Customs Service
was prohibited from conducting investigative, intelligence, and
law enforcement functions, relating to the suppression of drug
trafficking, at locations away from ports of entry or borders.
This aspect of the plan has been controversial and as elicited
much criticism on the ground that is weakened the &quot;Nation's
capability to interdict the flow of narcotics into the United
States.&quot; </p>

<p>The Commission has no objections to that feature of the 1973
reorganization plan that created a lead agency in Federal drug
law enforcement, and indeed believes that it remains a valid
concept today. However, the Commission has concluded that it is
an appropriate time to study whether the functions of the Customs
Service with respect to drug trafficking should be expanded to
include investigative, intelligence, and law enforcement
functions within this country, beyond the borders and ports of
entry, where appropriate and subject to the oversight and
supervision of the lead agencies. In this respect, the Commission
notes that the 1973 reorganization plan was modified somewhat
when, on January 5, 1984, the Attorney General signed the
&quot;Request for Assistance and Authorization Respecting Drug
Enforcement Activities of Certain Customs Officers in Domestic
Drug Investigations.&quot; This action granted authority to the
DEA Administrator to endow specific Customs agents, for a
designated period of time, with the power, among others, to
conduct investigative, intelligence, and law enforcement
functions relating to drug trafficking. Because this arrangement
appears to have worked well, a broader expansion of Customs'
functions may be warranted at this time in an effort to improve
domestic law enforcement. </p>

<p>In addition to the attitudinal and organizational matters
discussed above, the Commission proposes substantial expansion of
the use of one particular investigative technique because of the
magnitude of illicit drug production in this country. All of the
PCP (phencyclidine), almost all of the methamphetamine, and an
estimated 80 percent of injectable amphetamine available
illicitly in the United States in 1984 were produced in domestic
clandestine laboratories. In addition, an increasing amount of
cocaine in being processed in this country. In fact, the number
of cocaine laboratories seized by law enforcement authorities in
the United States between 1983 and 1984 nearly doubled. </p>

<p>To combat both the domestic and foreign production of illicit
drugs, law enforcement officials have, in some instances,
targeted the chemicals used to manufacture the drugs. For
example, through its &quot;Operation Chem-Con,&quot; DEA tracks
the movement of chemicals used to process cocaine from the
principal manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers to their final
destinations. According to the chief of the DEA's cocaine
section, Johnny Phelps: </p>

<p>Through cooperation gained by DEA from the world's ether
industry and foreign law enforcement elements, we now have
voluntary restrictions on sales to known trafficking groups and
are able to seize shipments of chemicals after purchase causing
great financial losses to cocaine producing consort[ia]. </p>

<p>In addition to the voluntary compliance of chemical companies
in Operation Chem-Con, reporting requirements are sometimes used
to control chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs.
Piperidine, a chemical used to manufacture the hallucinogen PCP,
is subject to reporting requirements under the Controlled
Substances Act. The provision requires that any person selling
piperidine report to the Attorney General information concerning
the sale, including identifying information about the purchaser,
and the quantity, form and intended use of the piperidine. This
system has worked well and permits DEA to investigate any
suspicious sales of piperidine. Since 1984 DEA has seized four
clandestine PCP laboratories and has located at least ten other
operations, which obtained chemicals for PCP manufacture by
posing as legitimate businesses. </p>

<p>Chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs can be regulated
in the same manner as controlled substances. Under the Controlled
Substances Act, the Attorney General may place an immediate
precursor in the same schedule as the controlled substance for
which it is a precursor. </p>

<p>Although the regulation of chemicals used to manufacture
illicit drugs can thwart efforts to produce these drugs and can
help law enforcement officials to locate clandestine
laboratories, several factors limit the effectiveness of such
approaches. First, many of these chemicals have widespread
legitimate uses in industry, and tracking their sales would be
impractical. Even tracking a limited number of these chemicals
would be costly, requiring adequate computer resources and
individuals to review and analyze chemical sales information.
Second, controls on chemicals may have only short-term effects.
In the case of the reporting of piperidine, both use of PCP and
clandestine laboratory activity appeared to decline from 1979 to
1981. However, by 1982, trafficking in and abuse of PCP had
increased. Third, some chemicals can be obtained illicitly. For
example, a shortage of P2P (phenyl-2-propanone), which is used to
manufacture methamphetamine, resulted from the placement of P2P
in Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. Traffickers
responded by increasing illicit manufacture of P2P in 1982. </p>

<p>Despite these limitations, controlling a limited number of
these chemicals has merit. The United Nations International
Narcotics Control Board has identified the following chemicals as
suitable targets for control: ether, used to process cocaine;
acetic anhydride, (heroin); P2P, (methamphetamine); ergotamine
(LSD); anthranilic acid (methaqualone); and piperidine (PCP).
This United Nations Board has called on countries in which
illicit drug manufacture occurs to impose a licensing system and
quotas for supplying and importation of these chemicals. </p>

<p>For the foregoing reasons, the Commission recommends that DEA
should determine which chemicals currently used to manufacture
illicit drugs should be subject to reporting requirements or
placed in a schedule of the Controlled Substances Act. This
review should included a consideration of which drugs are most
abused, which have the most serious consequences, and which
precursor chemicals are essential to the production process. In
addition, DEA should identify the resources needed for the
computerization, analysis and follow-up of reports concerning
chemicals selected for monitoring. </p>

<p>The Commission's final recommendations concerning Federal
domestic law enforcement relate to the Federal agents and
employees who are most involved in the Federal effort against
drugs. This country owes these agents the greatest possible
amount of protection and assistance against the vicious and
ruthless participants in organized crime trafficking
organizations. As the testimony of drug pilot Adler Barriman Seal
before this Commission revealed, because of the massive amounts
of money involved, high-level traffickers are able to procure and
use the products of the latest technological advances to
facilitate their trafficking operations. Drug agents must also be
given access to such state of the art equipment and weapons. In
this regard, the research and development operations of Federal
drug law enforcement agencies should work closely with field
agents to produce the equipment and tools needed to defeat drug
traffickers. </p>

<p>Finally, this Commission has made several recommendations
designed to improve Federal domestic law enforcement. However,
the men and women involved in the day-to-day effort against drug
trafficking have the most incentive and are the best qualified to
offer suggestions as to how to improve domestic law enforcement.
These &quot;experts&quot; should be encouraged to make
recommendations and should be rewarded for the ones that are
successful. </p>

<p>State and Local Domestic Law Enforcement </p>

<p>The role of State and local agencies in the national campaign
against drugs has been described above: they have the primary
responsibility for lower- and street-level enforcement because of
their proximity to the affected areas and because they possess or
can adopt the tools necessary for carrying out their mission. The
successful accomplishment of the mission of State and local law
enforcement agencies is a desirable end, in and of itself,
because harassment and disruption of drug retailers and smaller
or geographically-restricted distribution networks could lead to
a reduction in the supply of drugs, an increase in the price of
the drugs remaining in the marketplace, and discouragement of
non-drug users from experimenting with drugs. Successful
completion of this mission will also permit State and local
authorities to provide Federal law enforcement agencies with
information that will be invaluable to the latter in infiltrating
and disrupting high-level organized crime and other large
trafficking organizations. The leaders of State and local
agencies must constantly reiterate to their agents that their
efforts cannot be viewed in isolation and that they are part of
much larger national campaign against drugs. Such indoctrination
will result in the kind of cooperation and coordination essential
to the success of the overall national effort. </p>

<p>Effective State and local domestic drug law enforcement will
undoubtedly require increased expenditures, including the
expansion of prison facilities. Although the drug problem is
quite correctly denominated a National one, its devastating
effects are most pronounced at the State and local levels.
Therefore, the Commission recommends that State and local
governments determine what is necessary to permit their law
enforcement agencies to carry out their drug mission successfully
and do all they can to convince their citizens that any required
increase in expenditures is absolutely essential. Such a campaign
will be considerably more palatable if it includes a large
segment of funding from seized drug revenues and assets, as
described below. </p>

<p>The Commission has concluded that if a State is serious about
responding to the drug problem within its jurisdiction it must
provide its law enforcement agencies with certain tools that are
available to their Federal counterparts. The Commission therefore
recommends that those States, which do not already have such
statutes, consider enacting legislation patterned after the
following Federal statutes: Bail Reform Act of 1984, the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act;
statutory use and derivative use immunity for witnesses;
statutory criminal and civil forfeiture provisions; the
Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) statute; Title III of the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (electronic
surveillance); and the Currency and Foreign Transactions
Reporting Act. In addition, the Commission recommends that, where
appropriate, States consider adopting statewide grand juries,
with public reporting authority, to improve their investigations
of drug trafficking organizations and eliminating accomplice
corrobation statutes or rules. Although the Commission is
cognizant that there may be legitimate State constitutional
objections to the adoption of some provisions and devices, the
Commission nevertheless believes that each has increased the
effectiveness of Federal domestic law enforcement and would
similarly increase the effectiveness of State and local law
enforcement agencies in infiltrating and disrupting trafficking
groups. </p>

<p>Foreign Assistance </p>

<p>Because the majority of drugs consumed in the United States is
produced abroad, a primary component of our national strategy is
international cooperation to control drugs. A prerequisite of
this strategy is the cooperation of drug producing and
trafficking nations. While this has proved difficult or even
impossible in some situations, due to the political, economic or
social instability of some drug producing countries,
international cooperation can contribute to our national effort
to reduce drug consumption. </p>

<p>The United States provides various forms of assistance to
other countries to help them in their anti-drug efforts,
including both economic and military aid. According to the 1984
National Strategy For Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug
Trafficking, the objectives of the U.S. international strategy
are: </p>

<p>. . . strengthening U.S. efforts to assist foreign governments
in stopping the production and transportation of illicit drugs
and improving interdiction efforts in transit nations;
encouraging and assisting governments of producer nations to
undertake crop control programs as the most effective means of
curbing production; developing innovative mutual assistance
treaties with foreign governments, directed at facilitating
judicial actions against the drug trade, seizing assets derived
from drug trafficking, eliminating banking procedures which hide
illicit drug transactions, and extradition and other legal
arrangements; encouraging other nations to support international
narcotics control programs, financially and with other resources,
including developmental assistance linked with crop control and
cooperative law enforcement efforts; encouraging international
organizations and development banks to link their assistance with
narcotics control objectives, where appropriate; and curtailing
the diversion of pharmaceuticals and chemicals from legitimate
international commerce. </p>

<p>Indications are increasing that the concern over drug-related
problems is becoming universal. This growing concern is due
largely to recognition by governments in both developed and
less-developed countries, that the illicit production,
trafficking and abuse of drugs pose serious problems to their
nations' development, their societies, and in some cases, to
their national security. The multiple effects of drug trafficking
are increasingly felt in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and
Southwest Asia. These effects include crime, corruption, economic
destabilization, political manipulation, and epidemic drug abuse.
Much of the increased anti-drug activity in South American
countries in the past two years correlates directly to the
emergence of domestic drug problems in those countries, and their
awareness of their own vulnerability to the myriad problems
related to drug abuse. </p>

<p>At a time when drug traffickers rule segments of some
countries, and dominate local economies in others, an increasing
number of nations are realizing that passivity is not the answer.
This realization is encouraging efforts for more cooperation with
the United States in its multilateral enforcement and demand
reduction programs. Reduction in the demand for drugs in the
United States and abroad is beginning to be perceived by drug
producing and trafficking nations as a vital component in the
fight against drug abuse. It is an objective that has greater
long term potential for producing action by source nation
governments than do efforts perceived as benefiting the United
States exclusively. </p>

<p>The Commission recognizes the importance of existing
international drug control efforts. Because drug trafficking and
production are threats to the stability of existing democracies,
a primary goal of the United States and its allies should be to
enhance the security of drug producing and transshipment regions.
Because some source countries are promoting drug control in the
interests of their own national security and public welfare more
actively than they have in the past, it is an opportune time for
the United States to intensify its international drug control
efforts. The success of these efforts requires the political and
financial support of a much broader coalition within the
international community. </p>

<p>The United States offers assistance to numerous countries
around the world with drug abuse and trafficking problems,
primarily through the Department of State's Bureau of
International Narcotics Matters, the Agency for International
Development, and the United States Information Agency. The United
States currently supports crop eradication programs in 14
countries and is working to develop such programs in several
others. These control efforts are vitally enhanced by the public
adareness programs sponsored by the Department of State, the
Agency for International Development, and the United States
Information Agency. </p>

<p>There has been an ongoing debate in this country concerning
the wisdom of making foreign assistance, both general and
drug-related, conditional on the progress of drug control
efforts. Proponents of utilizing existing authority to suspend
aid to any nation not taking steps to control drug production
claim that the United States should employ this leverage as a
final step in forcing nations to stop drug production. Opponents
feel that sustained aid is necessary to achieve U.S.-supported
drug control objectives and that an aid cut-off might undermine
other U.S. interests in some cases. </p>

<p>The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board is now in a central
position in this area, as in all others in the anti-drug effort.
It should carefully evaluate the data used in the President's
annual decision whether to suspend aid to drug producing or
transshipment countries, and make a suitable recommendation to
the President for his ultimate decision. </p>

<p>Extradition and mutual assistance treaties can also contribute
to international drug control efforts by enhancing diplomatic
initiatives and providing leverage in United States' foreign
policy decisions. Clauses in several existing treaties are
particularly innovative and worthy of inclusion in future
agreements. The willingness of a country to engage in and
actively implement drug-related extradition and mutual assistance
treaties should be a primary consideration in ultimate U.S.
policy decisions regarding foreign assistance to a country, and
should be weighed in the deliberations of the President and the
policy Board described above. </p>

<p>The Department of State, in conjunction with the Department of
Defense, should continue its program of expanded economic
assistance with emphasis on assisting those foreign governments
making concerted efforts to control their drug problems. At the
same time, a recognition that drug trafficking has become a
national security issue should lead to the availability and use
of security assistance funds. The effectiveness of such
assistance is, of course, dependent upon the political will of
the host government. To encourage this, the United States should
raise the drug issue to the highest level possible in bilateral
relations with producer and trafficker nations. Similarly, the
United States should raise the drug issue in terns of
international security with its industrialized allies. This
should occur not only in the United Nations, but also on a
bilateral and multilateral basis. This would provide incentive in
urging those nations to increase their assistance and cooperation
within the region and in urging those nations to raise the issue
as a high priority in their bilateral relations with the producer
and trafficking nations. </p>

<p>In addition to these efforts to reduce the supply of drugs,
international efforts to reduce the demand for drugs are an
important component of U.S. strategy. The United States should,
therefore, continue to help producer nations develop prevention
and education programs aimed at drug abuse within the producer
and trafficker nations. </p>

<p>Indications are overwhelming that the world community in
general realizes the dangers inherent in drug use. In the past,
many nations regarded drug abuse as aberrational social behavior,
and relegated governmental reaction, if there was any at all, to
law enforcement or social/health ministries. As international
awareness of the actual nature and scope of the threat of drug
abuse increases, however, nations are placing the issue where it
belongs: within the realm of national security. </p>

<p>Source Country Crop Control </p>

<p>Strategies to control drug trafficking and drug abuse in the
United States have traditionally included measures designed to
eliminate illicit drug supplies at their source. These
&quot;source country eradication&quot; measures, primarily the
manual elimination or uprooting of illicit drug crops and the use
of herbicides to kill illicit plants, remain a central focus of
this country's anti-drug efforts. The 1984 National Strategy for
the Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking clearly states
U.S. policy in this regard: </p>

<p>Fundamental to the overall supply reduction effort is
eliminating illegal drugs as close to their source as possible.
The major gains will be realized in the longer term reduction in
the availability of illicit drugs. </p>

<p>Since 1978 the Department of State's Bureau of International
Narcotics Matters (BINM) has had primary responsibility for
overseeing and implementing foreign drug production control
efforts. BINM provides bilateral assistance for crop control and
interdiction programs in drug source countries in the form of
equipment, training and technical advisory services. BINM's
stated objective is: </p>

<p>to control production simultaneously in all key sectors of
illicit drugs exported to the United States so that significant
and lasting reductions in availability are achieved . . . .
Preventing cultivation and destroying illicit narcotics at their
source will prove to be the most effective means of reducing
availability. . . . BINM's first priority is on crop control -
government bans on cultivation production, enforced by manual or
chemical crop eradication. </p>

<p>In a successful crop control system drugs would be stopped at
their source, thereby alleviating the &quot;chain reaction&quot;
associated with drug trafficking and drug abuse in this country.
In fact, crop reduction efforts have at best enjoyed limited
success. Despite the fact that nearly all drug producing and
transit countries are signatories to a 1961 agreement that
restricts production and distribution of certain drugs to only
medical and scientific uses, drug production has escalated in
most source countries in the past 20 years. Increased production
has resulted in decreased prices and wider availability of most
illicit drugs in the United States. Accordingly, domestic
consumption of many drugs has increased. </p>

<p>The effectiveness of efforts to control illicit drug crops in
source countries is inherently limited. First, many source
country governments are not motivated to reduce crop production,
either because the profits obtained from the illicit crops are
essential to the economic and/or political stability of the
country, or because they view drug consumption as an exclusively
American problem. In addition, many drugs that are illegal in the
United States are traditionally consumed in milder forms by
source country natives and are viewed as necessities of life or
an essential part of their culture. </p>

<p>Secondly, in many cases farmers do not have an easily
available alternative crop. In any case, an illicit drug crop can
provide a farmer with far more income than any legitimate crop
and is therefore likely to be selected above any other crop for
cultivation. </p>

<p>Third, the governments in many producing areas are weak and do
not exert control over growers. The Thai and Burmese governments
have long been fighting insurgent groups in the Northwest
Frontier Provinces, where most of the Golden Triangle opium is
grown. The Peruvian government has had little effective control
in remote coca producing regions controlled by that country's
Shining Path Guerrillas. Even where governments aggressively
pursue crop eradication programs, difficulties are sometimes
overwhelming. </p>

<p>Fourth, some major source countries are controlled by
governments hostile to the United States, who while adopting
policies to reduce domestic consumption, have no hesitation about
importation of illicit drugs to the United States. Because many
source country governments are politically and economically
unstable, United States diplomatic relations with even nonhostile
source country governments are often very complex. </p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the set of source
countries is not fixed. When a crop is successfully reduced in
one country, production begins or increases in another country.
New producers constantly emerge. This shifting has been observed
repeatedly throughout the history of source country control
efforts, even where the United States has claimed major crop
eradication successsses. This has been the most serious obstacle
to total crop reduction efforts. </p>

<p>U.S. and Mexican efforts provide an example. The crop
eradication program conducted in the mid-1970's in Mexico is
often cited as a successful model. Through the program, the
United States supplied equipment, herbicide and funds for the
eradication of opium poppies, primarily in Northern Mexico. While
Mexican heroin production declined after the program's
implementation, heroin production in and export from the Golden
Triangle and the Golden Crescent accelerated, and within five
years, total heroin available in the United States reached levels
equal to those attained before the Mexican eradication program.
Mexican heroin production has increased every year since 1980,
and in 1984 that country provided an estimated 21 percent of the
total U.S. supply. </p>

<p>Despite the limitations of source country control programs,
the efforts to reduce international illicit drug crops are
essential to the overall U.S. drug strategy. Implemented
selectively and judiciously, crop control programs could
effectively reduce the availability of targeted illicit drugs in
the United States, if only on a temporary basis. As viewed by the
Select Committee on Narcotics, </p>

<p>Effective action in relatively few countries, against the
production and trafficking of opium, heroin, coca, cocaine,
marijuana and hashish would have a great impact on the drug abuse
problem in the United States by dramatically curtailing supplies
available to users and potential users . . . </p>

<p>The United States, through the Department of State, should
focus crop control efforts in those countries where political and
economic climates will make the success of crop eradication
programs probable. Particular crop control opportunities could
best be determined if the State Department established a cadre of
professional drug officers. Currently, international drug
programs are often managed by contract personnel or by Foreign
Service Officers not especially interested in drug issues.
Narcotics Assistance Unit positions within the Foreign Service
often remain unfilled for long periods of time because Foreign
Service Officers often view them as a detriment to their careers.
The absence of a specialized drug group within the Foreign
Service structure thus impacts negatively on the overall
international drug effort. The Department of State should
recognize Narcotics Assistance Unit positions as priority
assignments, and integrate them into the career advancement
structure. </p>

<p>BINM should also examine the possibility of introducing source
country farmers to more imaginative and feasible alternatives to
illicit drug cultivation. The available options are currently
limited to cultivating licit replacement crops but could possibly
include the mining of indigenous minerals and the introduction of
light industry to a traditional growing region. </p>

<p>Finally, the importance of international crop controls in the
context of the overall drug reduction strategy should be
reevaluated. The limitations inherent in these programs, the
majority of which are beyond the control of the United States,
make them a less likely success than other strategies discussed
elsewhere in this report. In addition, the problems associated
with international controls, most notably the relentless shifting
of drug crop cultivations to non-targeted countries, underscores
the ultimate importance of reducing the demand for drugs in this
country. History has shown that as long as consumer demand for an
illicit drug is strong, some country, somewhere, will become a
source country.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter VII Reducing the Demand for Drugs </h2>

<p>The Limitations of Tactics Affecting Supply </p>

<p>Traditionally, efforts to reduce the trafficking and abuse of
illicit drugs in this country have been based on the theory that
significant reductions of drug supplies would lead to equal
reductions in drug-related problems. While this seems plausible,
a review of the 75-year history of these efforts reveals that
they have not reduced social, economic or crime problems related
to drugs. Despite continuing expressions of determination,
America's war on drugs seems nowhere close to success. Now more
than ever, drugs present problems of vast proportions. </p>

<p>This does not suggest that efforts to reduce supply, such as
crop eradication, border interdiction, and prosecution, have
failed. To the contrary, they have achieved a measure of success.
In 1983, for example, authorities estimated that approximately 10
percent of the drugs destined for illicit markets were
interdicted. Crop eradication programs were significantly
expanded in Colombia, where most of the world's cocaine is
processed and nearly one-half of the marijuana consumed in the
United States is grown. In addition, indictments and convictions
of some of the world's most notorious traffickers have been
obtained in recent years. </p>

<p>Despite these efforts, American consumption of cocaine
increased an estimated 12 percent and dangerous drug use
increased an estimated 15 percent between 1983 and 1984. Cocaine,
heroin, amphetamine, and methamphetamine-related deaths
increased, as did cocaine, PCP, and methamphetamine-related
emergency room visits. </p>

<p>In short, strategies to reduce supply are &quot;working&quot;
by some standards, but only to a limited degree. </p>

<p>Although some inherent factors limit the effectiveness of
these tactics, the overwhelming and continuing demand for illicit
drugs among Americans is the primary cause of their limited
success. Millions want illicit drugs and are willing to violate
the law, spend billions of dollars, and in many cases risk their
lives to obtain them. </p>

<p>Supply Versus Demand </p>

<p>Although the supply of and demand for drugs have often been
considered separate issues, by both the public and private
sectors, they are in fact inseparable parts of a single problem.
The success of supply efforts are related to commitments made to
reduce the demand for drugs through drug abuse education,
treatment, research, vigorous enforcement of drug abuse laws, and
effective sentencing. Drug supply and demand operate in an
interrelated and dynamic manner. The strategies employed to limit
each should be similarly connected. </p>

<p>The national fight against illicit drugs relies on two
fundamental strategies: organized crime policy and drug abuse
policy. Organized crime policy targets specific criminal groups
and seeks to destroy those already in existence and prevent the
emergence of new ones. In contrast, drug abuse policy attempts to
reduce drug use and its associated adverse effects.
Theoretically, organized crime policy and drug abuse policy can
conflict. Reducing the demand for drugs advances the goals of
both organized crime policy and drug abuse policy. A
significantly smaller drug market, which would likely result from
a substantially reduced demand for drugs, would attack organized
crime groups by limiting the huge profits currently available in
drug trafficking, while simultaneously reducing the number of
drug users, the goal of drug abuse policy. </p>

<p>A clear example of the relationship of supply and demand is
provided by the case of heroin trafficker Cecily Lermusiaux, who
with several associates, moved heroin into an area of Las Vegas
where its use among &quot;middle to high-class whites&quot; was
previously unknown. In a scheme which began with the distribution
of free samples of heroin, Lermusiaux's independent heroin
business generated a profit of several million dollars in
approximately six years. </p>

<p>The demand for drugs is also widely recognized as the fuel
that the illicit drug industry needs to operate. According to
Colombian President Belisario Bentancur: </p>

<p>In the world war against narcotics, we need the commitment of
the consumer nations to attack the traffic with the same vigor we
have shown. We can make all the sacrifices possible, but if there
is enormous demand, production will never be completely
eradicated. </p>

<p>This sentiment has been echoed by the other side of the law.
Carlos Lehder, who heads one of Colombia's most notorious cocaine
cartels, sees the American demand for drugs as the driving force
behind the &quot;bonanza&quot; of drug trafficking: </p>

<p>The demand for drugs in the United States is so great that the
producer countries like Colombia play a really tiny role compared
to the total consumption of the United States. </p>

<p>Tactics to Reduce Demand </p>

<p>Efforts to reduce demand are not hampered by international
political complications, or other factors that limit the
effectiveness of tactics to reduce supply. This Commission is of
the opinion that since reducing demand is the single policy
option pursuable entirely within our own borders, it deserves
greater attention. </p>

<p>More successful tactics to reduce demand may in the long-run
decrease the need for current high levels of funding for
approaches to reduce supply. A significant reduction in the
demand for drugs as a complement to aggressive enforcement
efforts is likely to make drug trafficking less lucrative for
organized crime and thus prompt many organized crime groups to
drop out of the drug business. According to analyst Mark Kleiman:
</p>

<p>Demand reduction is clearly the strategy of choice with
respect to its effects on organized crime . . . anything that
tends to depress demand will reduce both trafficking-related
ancillary crime and the level of drug enforcement resources
needed to attain any given level of reduction in drug
consumption. </p>

<p>Skeptics have argued that past tactics to reduce demand have
not been successful. However, the history of drug abuse
prevention and treatment programs has been relatively short. It
was not until the upsurge of drug use in the 1960's that these
programs developed. Some early prevention approaches were
ill-conceived. For example, they often presented information
about drugs without persuasive arguments to deter their use, and
other programs used exaggerated information. Such programs have
been criticized for unintentionally encouraging experimentation
with drugs or squandering the credibility of anti-drug
information. The most recent and effective drug abuse education
and prevention programs focus on the psychological and
sociological factors that contribute to the onset of drug use.
Drug education programs must be continually evaluated and
improved to keep pace with changing drug abuse patterns. </p>

<p>In a model program, the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) used the strategy of the anti-smoking campaigns of the
late 1970's, which many feel were effective, to develop its
&quot;Just Say No&quot; campaign against drug use which
recognizes the impact of social pressure. NIDA seeks to show
adolescents through a music video, television commercials, and
other media that they can turn down drugs by simply saying
&quot;no&quot; to them. </p>

<p>While it is difficult to measure precisely the effectiveness
of such anti-drug advertising, it is clear that the media can
help shape attitudes. Just as beliefs about cigarette smoking
have changed in recent years, so too can attitudes about drugs.
Anti-drug advertising has an advantage over the anti-smoking
campaigns: drug dealers cannot openly advertise their product.
According to the New York advertising firm of Trout and Ries, </p>

<p>Unlike cigarette manufacturers, drug producers and sellers
cannot use advertising to promote a fashionable image for their
drugs. Quite the opposite, the government can use advertising to
make drugs less and less fashionable to use. This, if America
runs true to form, will dramatically reduce demand. When it's
'out' in America, it doesn't sell. </p>

<p>Reducing the demand for drugs requires a long-term commitment
because it takes time to change attitudes. This commitment must
be made by Federal, State, and local governments and the private
sector. Each must unequivocally reassert that any and all illicit
drug use is unacceptable in light of the effects of drugs on
individuals, families, communities, and governments. It is only
in this context that a war against drugs that seeks to limit both
the supply of and demand for drugs can be effective. </p>

<p>Federal Government </p>

<p>Federal Priorities </p>

<p>Three of the five elements of the current National Strategy
for Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking are directed to
reduction of demand: drug abuse prevention, medical
detoxification and treatment, and research. </p>

<p>The importance of reducing demand has, in addition, been,
publicly acknowledged by leading law enforcement officials.
According to Attorney General Edwin Meese III, for example: </p>

<p>All the enforcement efforts that we can try in this country,
all the police agencies in this nation and worldwide will never
be able to stem the supply of drugs in this nation until we have
first decreased the number of users and have decreased the demand
for these drugs. </p>

<p>John Lawn, administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), concurs: </p>

<p>Were we [DEAl to increase dramatically in size, the drug
problem would continue to exist until we could do something about
demand reduction. </p>

<p>While the importance of strategies to reduce demand has been
acknowledged, it is reduction of supply that has consumed the
bulk of the Federal drug abuse budget. This may be due, in part,
to the fact that certain enforcement operations are inherently
more expensive, and they are exclusively a Federal function. In
addition, primary responsibility for developing and maintaining
programs to reduce demand has been shifted to the States and the
private sector. </p>

<p>The concept of our current National Strategy, assigning
complementary roles to the Federal government, on the one hand,
and State and local governments and the private sector, on the
other, is commendable for its recognition of the unique roles of
each component. However, the adoption of this coordinated
approach carries with it the responsibility for ensuring that the
components perform in a truly coordinated and complementary
fashion. There is insufficient evidence today that this
responsibility is being met. Moreover, in precisely the same way
that approaches to reduce supply recognize a unique Federal
capability, there are certain functions in the area of demand
that, by their nature, can only be performed by the Federal
government. The Federal government's exclusive role in reducing
the demand for drugs includes providing national coordination in
the conduct of research, gathering nationwide data, and
developing and disseminating standards for drug prevention and
treatment programs across the country. </p>

<p>Current budgetary figures reflect the emphasis on drug law
enforcement. while programs to reduce demand at one time received
the larger share of the Federal budget, the focus on enforcement
has increased dramatically during the last decade. For example,
between fiscal year 82 and 86, Federal funding for drug abuse
prevention has decreased by 5 percent, while Federal funding for
drug law enforcement has increase by 70 percent. For fiscal year
1986 Federal expenditures on drug law enforcement constitute 84
percent of the total Federal drug abuse budget outlay of $1.7
billion. Interdiction alone consumes 38 percent of this budget.
In the same year Federal funding for drug abuse prevention
constitutes one percent, treatment and rehabilitation 6 percent,
and research 4 percent of the total Federal drug abuse budget. </p>

<p>In addition to this funding the Federal government provides
funding to the States for drug abuse prevention and treatment
through the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Block Grants.
For fiscal year 1986 between $65 and $244 million is made
available to the States for drug programs. However, prior to 1981
under the formula grant program, 40 percent more funds were
available to the States for these purposes. A thorough review of
the current budgetary allotments for anti-drug efforts, now
contemplated by the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board,
should be placed at the top of the agenda of the Board
immediately. This Commission concludes that such a review will
indicate that greater Federal resources should be devoted to
programs to reduce demand, and that the Board should pursue
appropriate action without hesitation. </p>

<p>Asset Forfeiture </p>

<p>Expanded efforts to reduce demand would, of course, require
additional funding at all levels. A particularly promising source
of such funding is the considerable amount of money and property
obtained annually through forfeiture and seized by law
enforcement officials. In 1984 Federal agencies obtained an
estimated $400 to 450 million through the forfeiture and seizure
of drug traffickers assets. Rudolph Guiliani, U.S. Attorney for
the Southern District of New York, observes: </p>

<p>The drug dealers are just about paying for the drug law
enforcement, and hopefully we can get them to pay for drug
education. </p>

<p>Under current policy, the Federal government channels all
seized and forfeited assets into Federal, State, and local law
enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice Assets
Forfeiture Fund. Presently, no portion of these funds is used for
Federal drug demand reduction programs, such as prevention,
treatment, and research. However, pending legislation is being
considered that would direct use of portions of the Assets
Forfeiture Fund for drug abuse prevention and treatment programs.
A portion of the Federal government's asset forfeiture fund
derived from drug cases should be devoted to programs to reduce
demand in whatever proportion is indicated by the Policy Board's
budgetary review. Funding to reduce demand should include a
responsible contribution to the States for their own programs in
this area. However, any funding directed to the States should be
made contingent upon their vigorous pursuit of such programs, and
after a reasonable grace period, funding should be denied to any
State failing this requirement. Failure to enact State electronic
surveillance measures and asset forfeiture provisions, with the
proceeds thereof directed to anti-drug programs, should
constitute per se failure. </p>

<p>Research </p>

<p>Because data concerning drug abuse are in many instances
relatively incomplete, and in all cases, subject to change based
on new discoveries, continuing research is a fundamental
component of any drug strategy. Recent discoveries concerning
cocaine provide an example. The 1967 President's Commission on
Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice reported that
cocaine did not &quot;create tolerance or physical
dependence;&quot; however, research during the 1980's showed that
cocaine does, in fact, create tolerance and some argue, physical
dependence. Despite this increased understanding about cocaine,
many experts, such as Dr. Arnold Washton, argue that research
about the effects of cocaine is still in its &quot;infancy.&quot;
</p>

<p>Continuing research is required not only by the complex nature
of drugs and their effects on the human mind and body, but also
by the constantly shifting patterns of drug abuse. While heroin
has traditionally been the most frequently encountered drug of
abuse among individuals in treatment programs, cocaine now
follows closely behind and has, in fact, overtaken heroin as the
primary drug of abuse by those in treatment in 18 States. While
requests for treatment by cocaine users are estimated to have
increased by as much as 600 percent in the last three years,
research about cocaine and its effects has not kept pace with
this growing problem. The development of new drugs, such as
controlled substance analogs, presents another compelling need
for continuing research. </p>

<p>Data Collection and Dissemination </p>

<p>As part of its research responsibilities, NIDA supports two
continuing epidemiological surveys, the National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse and the High School Senior Survey. While these two
surveys provide valuable information about the extent of drug
use, neither NIDA nor any other agency systematically collects or
disseminates information about the thousands of drug abuse
programs. </p>

<p>State governments, which disbursed 46 percent ($642.5 million)
of the funding for alcohol and drug abuse prevention and
treatment services in fiscal year 1984, do not systematically
report to the Federal government about these programs. This lack
of data is due primarily to the absence of any statutory
requirement for such reporting, and is a major obstacle to
effective drug policy planning. The States should be required to
report to the National Institute on Drug Abuse information about
their prevention and treatment programs. With this information,
and reports obtained from private programs, NIDA will be better
able to identify the best prevention and treatment programs and
to develop and disseminate standards and guidelines for such
programs to the States. The States should, in turn, provide this
information to all groups engaged in prevention, treatment, and
related research. </p>

<p>Guidelines </p>

<p>Because the Federal government does not systematically collect
and evaluate information about drug abuse prevention and
treatment programs, it cannot develop substantive guidelines for
such efforts. The history of drug abuse prevention has
demonstrated that certain approaches are considerably more
effective than others. Some have even unwittingly encouraged
experimentation with drugs. As an increasing number of school and
community-based prevention programs are created, the need for
guidelines for drug abuse programs is particularly acute.
Officials at NIDA acknowledge that many programs use outdated
factual information and philosophies; however, the Federal
government is in a unique position to establish and disseminate
such guidelines to improve both State and private sector drug
abuse programs. Its current failure to do so is a major
deficiency in the campaign against drug abuse. </p>

<p>In addition to contributions to reducing the demand for drugs
through research, data collection and dissemination, and the
formation of guidelines, the Federal government should provide an
example of the unacceptability of drug use. The President should
direct the heads of all federal agencies to formulate immediately
clear policy statements, with implementing guidelines, including
suitable drug testing, expressing the utter unacceptability of
drug use by Federal employees. Government contracts should not be
awarded to companies which fail to implement drug programs,
including suitable drug testing. </p>

<p>State and Local Governments </p>

<p>State and local governments are key components in the national
campaign against drug abuse. Their unique capabilities in the
area of reducing demand include State-sponsored media campaigns
against drug use, prevention and education programs in the
schools, drug treatment programs, more vigorous enforcement of
State drug laws, and the inclusion of mandatory treatment or jail
sentences, as appropriate, for those individuals convicted of
possession of drugs. Because the nature of drug use tends to vary
among different geographical areas, State and local governments
are best positioned to tailor techniques to reduce demand to suit
their particular drug problem. </p>

<p>Drug Education </p>

<p>The public school systems of State and local governments
provide an appropriate forum for drug abuse prevention programs.
Consistent with identified measures of success, State governments
should establish credentialing standards for prevention and
treatment programs. They should further require that all
elementary, junior high, and high schools within the State
include drug abuse prevention programs in their curricula,
designed in a manner consistent with such credentialing
standards. State funding should be made available to assure the
proper training of educators assigned to such programs. </p>

<p>Combining prevention programs, clear school policies about the
consequences of drug use, increased discipline, and higher
academic standards has been demonstrated to be effective. For
example, Northside High School in Atlanta, Georgia implemented
such a program in the late 1970's in the face of &quot;poor
academic performance . . . student apathy . . . discipline
problems . . . class cutting and open drug use on campus.&quot;
By the early 1980's, performance on standardized tests improved
significantly and &quot;the use and possession of drugs on campus
[had] all but disappeared.&quot; Every employer, public and
private, and public education institutions at all levels should
have clearly-stated policies prohibiting drug use, possession of
drugs, or being under the influence of drugs on their premises.
The consequences of violating these prohibitions should be
clearly explained. </p>

<p>Law Enforcement </p>

<p>A critical part of a national campaign to reduce demand is
vigorous enforcement by State and local governments of their laws
regarding the possession of controlled substances. The Department
of Justice Uniform Crime Report for 1984 states that 552,552
arrests were made in 1984 by State and local police agencies for
possession of drugs. Given that in 1984 there were estimated to
be 20 million monthly marijuana users, over four million monthly
cocaine users, and approximately 520,000 heroin addicts, it is
clear that the statistical probability of arrest for possession
was and is quite low. This low probability of arrest vitiates in
large part whatever deterrent value laws against drug possession
and use may have. </p>

<p>In addition to increasing the likelihood of arrest for drug
possession, punishment for those convicted of such offenses can
be more effective. Drug users are not &quot;victims&quot; who
bear no responsibility for their actions. Imprisonment for
recidivists provides both deterrent value and an opportunity to
break the cycle of drug use. Uniform and rational sentencing for
drug offenses is essential. Such a system should provide a
sentence of probation and a fine for a first offense involving
possession of drugs. The terms of probation should include a
requirement to remain drug-free, to be verified through periodic
drug testing. A second offense for possession of drugs should
result in a jail sentence or mandatory treatment, if appropriate,
or fines or all three. The results of random drug screening
should be used in considering parole in cases of both drug
possession and trafficking. </p>

<p>Society's commitment to the unacceptability of illicit drug
use is properly expressed in vigorous enforcement of the laws
regarding possession of drugs and sentencing of recidivist users
to jail terms and mandatory treatment. Such a national commitment
is in conflict with various States' relaxation of criminal
penalties for the possession of marijuana. Because such measures
were based on limited information and popular misinformation
about the effects of marijuana, it is appropriate for those
States that reduced these penalties during the 1970's to
reconsider these laws. This reconsideration is warranted,
especially in light of a Federal campaign against marijuana
smuggling and the considerable evidence that a substantial share
of marijuana trafficking is dominated by organized crime groups,
which are both ruthless and involved in smuggling other drugs. In
addition, the sale of drug paraphernalia undermines this Nation's
anti-drug efforts. States that have not already done so should
enact and enforce laws prohibiting the sale of drug
paraphernalia. </p>

<p>Reducing demand and increased enforcement of drug possession
laws will undoubtedly place a greater burden on our courts and
will generate the need for more jail cells and treatment
facilities. The accompanying increase in expenditures, however,
could be met in part with funding extracted from the illicit drug
industry itself. All 50 States currently authorize forfeiture of
assets in connection with drug trafficking and manufacturing,
making available millions of dollars in cash and property each
year to State governments. </p>

<p>The Private Sector: Attitudes and Actions </p>

<p>The hostess who is certain enough of her own unwillingness to
tolerate pot smoking in her home doesn't need to call the cops to
keep her guests from lighting up. </p>

<p>&quot;Great scent. Lousy name.&quot; - Advertising Age, a
trade journal commenting on &quot;Opium,&quot; a popular perfume
marketed by Charles of the Ritz, a subsidiary of Squibb
Pharmaceuticals. </p>

<p>Drug abuse is fundamentally a social problem, which cannot be
solved by the government alone. Federal and State governments can
support drug abuse prevention and treatment programs, conduct
research, enforce drug laws and provide leadership in the fight
against drug abuse and drug trafficking. However, not until
public and individual attitudes change will illicit drugs and the
organized criminal groups that traffic in them be eliminated.
Individuals need not accept drug use in their midst. There is no
&quot;right&quot; to use drugs. Government efforts to combat drug
trafficking and drug abuse are a vital effort, but they are
ultimately only a holding action, while consensus continues to
build among individuals concerning the utter unacceptability of
drug use. </p>

<p>Despite this growing consensus, a profound disparity exists
between principle and practice. Popular entertainment arid
advertising, sometimes subtle, sometimes not, regularly reflects
and even promotes the view that the use of illicit drugs is
glamorous, exciting, and sophisticated, or at least harmless and
amusing. </p>

<p>The illusion that drug use is glamorous is regularly, if
somewhat indirectly, reinforced by revelations that drug use is
commonplace among celebrities in the sports and entertainment
worlds. In August 1985, for example, the New York Times reported
cocaine's alleged use by players on virtually every team in the
major leagues, prompting the Commissioner of Baseball to declare
drug use the &quot;number one&quot; problem facing the game. </p>

<p>It is even possible to find purportedly responsible groups
urging not only recognition but acceptance of drug use as a
feature of daily life. An article in the January/February 1984
issue of Social Work, the journal of the National Association of
Social Workers, prescribes the following for adolescent marijuana
use: </p>

<p>Use should be moderate . . no more than four to five joints
per week seem advisable. </p>

<p>Such acceptance of drug use may be shared by many who resign
themselves to the fact that drug abuse is inevitable. Such a view
reflects a failure of will on the part of the American public.
American society may view drug use in the abstract as wrong, and
many People agree that heroin addicts who commit additional
crimes to support their drug habits should be jailed. However,
many people react with ambivalence to the drug use in their
midst. Even while the United States government spends almost a
billion and one-half dollars on drug law enforcement, threatens
to cut off foreign aid to drug producing countries, and
extradites and imprisons foreign nationals on trafficking
charges, we appear to lack the same degree of resolve to hold
this country's drug users, as well as those who directly or
indirectly promote drug use, accountable for their actions and
the consequences thereof. </p>

<p>While attitudes are ultimately an individual matter, actions
need not be. It is in combination with others that private
citizens have been most effective in combatting drug abuse. As
discussed earlier, athletes, entertainers, manufactures,
advertisers and media can promote drug use by their individual
examples or by favorable portrayals of drug use. However, these
elements of society also have the power to shape different public
attitudes about drug use by presenting the truth about drugs. The
media and entertainment industries should carefully review their
portrayals of drug use and its consequences and ensure their
accuracy. </p>

<p>Efforts to combat drug abuse can also be successful in the
workplace. Many businesses across the country have Employee
Assistance Programs (EAPs), which seek to prevent drug abuse at
the worksite and which offer treatment and referrals. In
addition, many businesses now test employees or prospective
employees for drug use. According to a survey of 100 Fortune 500
companies, two-thirds refuse to hire job applicants who fail such
tests, 25 percent fire employees and 41 percent require treatment
for employees who fail. Drug testing protects businesses, which
lose billions of dollars each year in reduced productivity as a
result of drug use, employees, and the public. Drug testing in
certain &quot;critical positions,&quot; such as in the
transportation industry, law enforcement, and education is
particularly important. </p>

<p>In addition to efforts in the workplace to combat drug abuse,
health professionals, such as physicians, nurses, psychologists,
and social workers can help identify and treat drug users.
However, currently formal training in the diagnosis and treatment
of drug abuse is limited. Health professionals should be
thoroughly trained to identify and counsel drug abusers. </p>

<p>Decisions to use or not to use drugs are ultimately derived
from values that are best inculcated and reinforced in families,
churches, civic organizations, schools and local communities. The
efforts of organizations, which seek to help families prevent
drug use, such as the National Federation of Parents for
Drug-Free Youth, are essential to the fight against drug use and
drug trafficking. First Lady Nancy Reagan has made an important
contribution to this effort to reduce the demand for drugs.
Relying on the task force approach which law enforcement
officials have used successfully, parents, churches, schools,
civic organizations, and business associations should form
community task forces in every community across the country to
provide a unified front against drugs.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter VIII Summary of Recommendations </h2>

<p>Based on its findings and the extended analysis, found
elsewhere in the report, (primarily in Chapters VI and VII), the
Commission makes the following recommendations: </p>

<p>General Recommendations </p>

<p>1. The ultimate goal of the Nation's drug policy is the
effective suppression of drug abuse in the United States. While
efforts to reduce the supply of drugs in this country, such as
interdiction and source country crop controls, indirectly advance
this goal, efforts to reduce the demand for drugs can make a more
direct contribution. For this reason, the Nation's drug policy
must emphasize more strongly efforts to reduce the demand for
drugs. </p>

<p>2. Because drug trafficking and abuse are the most serious
organized crime problems in America today, they must be addressed
at the highest levels of government. Therefore, the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board (Board), under the direction of the
Attorney General, is and should continue to be responsible for
this country's drug policy. The mandate of the Board should be
interpreted, or expanded if necessary, to require the Board to
coordinate carefully efforts to reduce both drug demand and
supply to achieve this ultimate goal. The Board should evaluate
all programs undertaken pursuant to the national drug strategy in
terms of their contribution to this goal. In recognition of the
scope of the problem of international drug trafficking and the
extended national effort needed to combat it, the Attorney
General, as Chairman of the National Drug Enforcement Policy
Board, should depart from the current formulation of a National
Strategy on an annual basis, directing instead the formulation of
a long range national offensive against drug supply and demand,
including long term funding proposals. Such a program should
include an appropriate role for State and local agencies as a
complement to Federal efforts. State and local police agencies
should be trained and equipped to perform such a role. </p>

<p>3. The rigorous pursuit of the Nation's drug policy, as
proposed in this report, will not undermine its organized crime
policy. Indeed, the goals of the two policies substantially
overlap and therefore both can and must be implemented
simultaneously and aggressively. </p>

<p>4. The cost of this Nation's anti-drug efforts can be
subsidized to a great extent by the seizure and forfeiture of
drug traffickers' assets. That portion of the Federal
government's asset forfeiture fund derived from drug cases should
be devoted exclusively to anti-drug programs. Such a funding
mechanism should be made permanent through law, and the current
ceiling of $10 million should be eliminated. In the annual
Congressional appropriations process, these funds should be
allocated to participating agencies according to Congressional
findings, just as if the funds were appropriated. </p>

<p>5. Because of the international dimensions of drug
trafficking, the United Nations, in performance of its leadership
role in the international community, should sponsor the drafting
and promotion of a model International Controlled Substances Act,
identifying each and every drug which is trafficked to the
detriment of any single member nation. This model act should be
accompanied by a Model Mutual Legal Assistance and Extradition
Treaty, embodying the recognition that international drug
trafficking is a matter of profound international concern. In the
spirit of international cooperation, the Attorney General, as
Chairman of the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board, should
direct the creation of bilateral working groups, modeled on the
present Italian-American Working Group. </p>

<p>Interdiction </p>

<p>1. Within the overall structure of the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board (the Board), the Vice President's role
as leader and coordinator of interdiction efforts should be
recognized, maintained, and strengthened. </p>

<p>2. A proper and realistic goal of our interdiction efforts
should be the maintenance of persistent pressure on drug
traffickers, both as a deterrent and as a symbol of national
determination. Operational and policy decisions should reflect
that measure of su cess and specifically reject any less
realistic or effective goal. </p>

<p>3. Both Congress and the Board should carefully evaluate the
technical capabilities and equipment of drug smugglers. To the
extent that law enforcement agencies' capabilities and equipment
are inferior to those of drug traffickers, immediate steps should
be taken to rectify the situation. </p>

<p>4. All Federal agencies having any responsibility for the
regulation of air, sea, or land travel into or out of the United
States should review their policies and practices and ensure that
no purpose other than the promotion of public safety is given
priority over the effort to combat drug trafficking. To this end,
the proposed &quot;Customs Enforcement Act of 1985&quot; should
be enacted promptly. </p>

<p>5. The Policy Board should carefully examine the regulatory
practices of the Federal Aviation Administration, particularly in
the field of aircraft modification, to determine whether
possibilities exist for more aggressive anti-smuggling efforts.
In addition, the Policy Board should carefully monitor the design
of the Federal Aviation Administration's approach radar system to
ensure that interdiction capabilities and opportunities are
maximized. </p>

<p>6. Diplomatic initiatives should be pursued immediately to
facilitate Customs pursuit of suspected airborne drug traffickers
into Mexican air space. Such efforts should be given the highest
priority in our bilateral relations with Mexico, including the
Western Hemisphere discussions agreed upon between the Presidents
of the United States and Mexico on January 3, 1986. </p>

<p>7. The Policy Board should thoroughly evaluate expanded use of
Coast Guard aviation capabilities in drug interdiction. </p>

<p>8. Congress should give careful consideration to user fees as
a means of supplementing the Coast Guard's budget. Fees should go
directly to the Coast Guard's budget rather than the general
Treasury. </p>

<p>9. Both the Policy Board and the Department of Defense should
continue to examine Navy assistance to Coast Guard interdiction
operations, with a view to expanding such assistance whenever and
wherever possible. Such expansion should be facilitated by
adoption of the broader military view of national security
advocated in this report. </p>

<p>10. Monies from the proposed permanent asset forfeiture fund
should be made available to the Customs Service for the
acquisition of necessary equipment, including but not limited to
the type of fast patrol boats recently deployed in Operation Blue
Lightning. </p>

<p>11. Joint Federal-State-local interdiction operations, such as
Operation Blue Lightning, should be refined and used wherever
feasible and desirable. </p>

<p>Intelligence </p>

<p>1. The Policy Board should take all necessary steps to ensure
that data concerning all aspects of both drug supply and demand
are adequately collected, analyzed, correlated and disseminated. </p>

<p>2. The Federal electronic surveillance statute should be
examined and amended to reflect existing technology. Existing
State laws should be similarly studied and changed where
necessary. Those States still without a statute permitting
court-ordered electronic surveillance should immediately enact
one, consistent with current technology. </p>

<p>3. The &quot;Mansfield Amendment&quot; to the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291 (c)(l)) should be repealed
in its entirety. The concerns addressed by that legislation
should be incorporated in agency guidelines which provide
necessary flexibility while embodying the limits of permissible
U.S. agency conduct. </p>

<p>4. Data relating to assets forfeited to Federal, State and
local jurisdictions should be collected, analyzed, and
disseminated by the all source intelligence center discussed
elsewhere in this report. </p>

<p>5. Because of the importance of information about individuals
in drug treatment programs, the Federal government should again
require the States to participate in the Client Oriented Data
Acquisition Process. </p>

<p>6. Both the Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the High School
Senior Survey should over sample populations thought to be heavy
drug users. In addition, because questions about the nature of
drug transactions, e.g., the price paid and purity and quantity
of the drug purchased, could provide important information for
policy makers and enforcement officials, such questions should be
added to the Household and High School Senior Surveys. </p>

<p>Combined Intelligence and Interdiction </p>

<p>1. The Policy Board should take immediate steps to ensure that
the law enforcement and intelligence communities are thoroughly
familiar with each other's needs and capabilities. </p>

<p>2. Every agency involved in the interdict ion of drug
shipments or the apprehension of drug traffickers should have
ready access to all necessary intelligence gathered in source and
transshipment countries. To the extent that this requires
expansion or modification of existing practices, the Policy Board
should ensure that such change is pursued immediately. In
particular, the critical nature of real-time intelligence to
effective Customs operations at the border must be recognized,
and the Policy Board should take all necessary steps to ensure
that, under current Federal organization, such information from
all sources is being provided. </p>

<p>3. To the extent that the intelligence community under the
current Federal structure needs direction from the highest levels
of government concerning aggressive anti-drug actions, including
operations against the infrastructure of foreign drug-trafficking
organizations, such direction should be provided immediately. </p>

<p>4. The &quot;all-source intelligence and operations
center,&quot; now being considered by the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board, should be pursued aggressively and
expeditiously. It should combine in a physically secure facility
the functions now being performed by EPIC and NNBIS, retaining
the current Vice Presidential direction and regional structure of
the latter for interdiction functions. Ft. Bliss, Texas, and
similar locations should be considered as possible sites for the
center. Its design, giving due consideration to the protection of
civil liberties, should provide specific roles for all pertinent
Department of Defense components and for all members of the
intelligence community, to the fullest extent Permitted by
Executive Order 12333, The design should also incorporate
specific foreign intelligence-gathering functions for other U.S.
Agencies, in order to maximize the acquisition of both strategic
and tactical data. Each Participating agency should be required
to present to the Policy Board its specific operational
guidelines for providing time-sensitive data to the center. The
center should also Include a uniform national system for
gathering and analyzing drug related data on various categories
of information, including arrests, seizures, convictions,
sentences, forfeitures, emergency room admissions, and deaths. A
similar system of compiling and analyzing financial data gathered
by all members of the intelligence community, as well as that
contained in all financial records now required by law to be kept
by any Federal agency, should also be included as an Integral
component of the center. Both data bases should be compiled and
maintained in a fashion that provides reliable, constant, and
uniform tracking, retrieval, and compilation for the purpose of
charting trends and profiles, as well as support for specific
operations whenever Possible. Access to all data compiled should
be available to appropriate State and local agencies, in addition
to Federal components, subject to Procedures necessary to ensure
the integrity of the information-sharing process. </p>

<p>5. Joint enforcement and intelligence operations by source and
transshipment countries should be encouraged, and careful,
resourceful analysis should be given to identify means of U.S.
funding of such operations. Consistent with other recommendations
in this report, participation in such operations by American
components should be promoted. </p>

<p>6. The Department of State should stress to Chiefs of Mission
at principal reporting posts and to all other cognizant
Departmental personnel the high priority attached to a
coordinated narcotics intelligence and interdiction strategy. </p>

<p>7. All necessary steps should be taken to ensure that Consular
officers can and do deny U.S. entry visas to individuals
suspected of drug trafficking. Subject to the informing agency's
safeguards of reliability, information provided by any agency of
the United States, without further corroboration, should be
sufficient to require such denial under the pertinent statute, 8
U.S.C. Section 1182 (a)(23). The Policy Board should promptly
establish guidelines for similar information-sharing on a
government-wide basis. </p>

<p>8. Both Congress and the Executive Branch should closely
examine the operations and cost effectiveness of drug-related
intelligence-gathering abroad. When and where justified by such
an examination, resources available for such operations should be
expanded. Particular attention should be paid to the critical
need for adequate foreign intelligence by the Customs Service in
performing its border interdiction function. </p>

<p>9. Coast Guard officers should be thoroughly integrated into
the Defense Attache system. </p>

<p>10. The definition of &quot;national security&quot; now
employed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as their starting point in
mission determination is: </p>

<p>A collective term encompassing both national defense and
foreign relations of the United States. Specifically, the
condition provided by: </p>

<p>a. a military or defense advantage over any foreign national
or group of nations, or </p>

<p>b. a favorable foreign relations position, or </p>

<p>c. a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostile
or destructive action from within or without, overt or covert. </p>

<p>The Joint Chiefs should be instructed by the highest levels of
government, through a National Security Decision Directive or by
other appropriate means, that &quot;hostile or destructive action
from within or without, overt or covert,&quot; as used in this
definition, shall include the airborne, amphibious, and overland
invasion of this country by drug smugglers. This policy is
already followed by the intelligence community, pursuant to
Executive Order 12333. All Department of Defense and component
operational decisions concerning interdiction of drug smugglers
should be made accordingly. </p>

<p>11. For the purposes of intelligence-gathering mission
planning, the Joint Chiefs of Staff should be given direction
from the highest levels of government that the Defense
Department's definition of &quot;foreign hostile action&quot; is
to be brought into accord with the view expressed in Executive
Order 12333, as described in the preceding recommendation. </p>

<p>12. Consistent with the foregoing definitions of
&quot;national security&quot; and &quot;foreign hostile
action,&quot; Department of Defense policies and practices, such
as existing interpretations of the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. Section
1535, and exemptions to the Posse Comitatus Act, 10 U.S.C.
Section 371 et al., should be thoroughly re-examined. Unit
planning and deployment should be adjusted accordingly. </p>

<p>13. The Posse Comitatus Act, IS U.S.C. Section 1385, and its
1981 exemptions, now found at 10 U.S.C. Section 371 et seq,
should be consolidated in Title 18. The consolidated statute
should include a statement of purpose reflecting the view of
national security advocated here and promoting an accordingly
expansive interpretation of the statutory language, subject to
such limitations as are necessary to protect civil liberties. </p>

<p>14. The Policy Board, in accordance with Executive Orders
12333 and 12472, and with applicable National Security Decision
Directives, if any, should coordinate with appropriate agencies
and departments to ensure that a secure and interoperable,
interagency communications capability is available for
drug-related intelligence collection and dissemination in support
of interdiction and other anti-drug activities. The resources and
expertise of the National Security Agency should be fully
exploited to this end, and operational and communications
security should be given a high priority in the training and
operating procedures of all pertinent agencies. </p>

<p>Domestic Investigations and Prosecutions </p>

<p>1. Domestic drug law enforcement efforts directed at
high-level trafficking groups should be supplemented by and
integrated with enforcement efforts directed at lower-level
trafficking groups and street-level drug activity. Unless the
necessary supplementation and integration occur, the enforcement
effort at all levels will be undermined. </p>

<p>2. Although the enforcement efforts of Federal and State and
local law enforcement agencies cannot and should not be
completely independent, these agencies nevertheless have primary
areas of responsibility. The Federal law enforcement agencies
should concentrate their efforts on infiltrating and disrupting
high-level organized crime and other large trafficking
organizations. State and local law enforcement agencies on the
other hand should focus their resources on street-level drug
activity and on smaller and geographically-restricted trafficking
organizations. </p>

<p>3. Although Federal, State and local agencies have primary
areas of responsibility, the drug problem is a national one that
requires extensive and genuine coordination and cooperation among
all agencies. Those in charge of the agencies involved in
domestic drug law enforcement must constantly instill In their
agents the need for such coordination and cooperation, especially
with respect to the exchange of drug intelligence. Joint
operations, such as Operation Pressure Point, the New York Drug
Enforcement Task Force, and the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement
Task Force Program, have fostered this required spirit of
cooperation and coordination, and they should be undertaken
whenever appropriate, provided that they do not interfere with an
agency's primary mission. </p>

<p>4. The sophistication of high-level trafficking groups
requires an equivalent Federal response. Because of the variety
of investigative techniques used by participating Federal
agencies and their unique ability to exploit such tools as
electronic surveillance, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), the Continuing Criminal Enterprise
statutory provision (CCE), forfeiture, and currency transactions
reports, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF)
Program is the Federal mechanism that is best equipped to respond
to and disrupt high-level organized crime trafficking groups. Its
operation should be supported strongly and its scope should be
expanded wherever feasible and desirable. </p>

<p>5. Because the OCDETF Program has been operational for more
than two years, the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board should
consider whether a lead Task Force agency should be designated.
As an alternative, the U.S. attorneys Involved should be given
greater policy authority with respect to the participating
agencies In order to improve still further the coordination that
has been achieved by the consensus-based decision-making
approach. If the latter approach is taken, the Board must take
steps to ensure uniform policies and priorities are recognized by
all United States Attorneys involved. </p>

<p>6. The heads of the agencies participating in the OCDETF
Program must continually and unambiguously reiterate their total
commitment to the success of the program. One simple way they can
do so is to ensure that their agents involved in the Program are
not affected adversely in any way with respect to career
advancement by their participation therein. </p>

<p>7. The components of Federal domestic law enforcement other
than the OCDE Task Forces should focus their resources on
organized crime trafficking groups that do not qualify for OCDETF
program treatment and on other large trafficking organizations,
which may or may not be multi-jurisdictional. </p>

<p>8. To eliminate jurisdictional disputes between the Federal
agencies involved in domestic law enforcement, to avoid
duplication of investigative efforts, and to increase the safety
of drug agents, the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board should
establish a system whereby agencies would be required to file
reports on whom they are investigating. If more than one agency
is investigating the same individual, the agencies involved would
be required to negotiate and to determine the best way for
proceeding with the investigation, subject to uniform Policy
Board guidelines. Such a reporting and control system should be
incorporated into the &quot;all source intelligence and
operations center&quot; recommended elsewhere in this report. </p>

<p>9. It is an appropriate time to consider whether the mission
of the Customs Service with respect to drug trafficking should be
expanded to include intelligence and law enforcement functions
beyond the borders and ports of entry within this country, where
appropriate, subject to the lead responsibility of the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA). </p>

<p>10. DEA should determine which chemicals currently used to
manufacture illicit drugs should be subject to reporting
requirements or placed in a Schedule established by the
Controlled Substances Act. This review should include a
consideration of which drugs are most abused, which have the most
serious consequences, which precursor chemicals are essential to
the production process, and which chemicals could feasibly be
regulated. In addition, DEA should identify the resources needed
for the computerization, analysis, and follow-up of reports
concerning chemicals selected for monitoring. </p>

<p>11. The research and development operations of Federal drug
law enforcement agencies should work closely with their field
agents to produce the equipment and tools necessary to defeat
traffickers. The expertise of the Central Intelligence and
National Security Agencies should be called upon to the fullest
extent possible and proper in this regard. </p>

<p>12. Although the drug problem is a national one, its immediate
effects are felt most at State and local levels. To respond
effectively to the drug problem, State and local jurisdictions
will have to increase expenditures for such critical resources as
prison facilities, increased manpower, and sophisticated
equipment. </p>

<p>13. States must provide their law enforcement agencies with
certain tools available to their Federal counterparts. Those
States, which do not already have such statutes, should consider
enacting legislation patterned after the following Federal
statutes: Bail Reform Act of 1984; the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act; statutory use and derivative
use immunity for witnesses; statutory criminal and civil
forfeiture provisions; the Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE)
statute; Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act of 1968 (electronic surveillance); and the Currency and
Foreign Transactions Reporting Act. States should consider
adopting statewide grand juries in order to improve their
investigations of drug trafficking organizations, as well as
eliminating accomplice corroboration statutes or rules. </p>

<p>Foreign Assistance </p>

<p>1. Because drug trafficking and production are threats of such
magnitude to the stability of existing democracies, a primary
goal of the United States and its allies should be to enhance the
security of drug producing and transshipment regions. </p>

<p>2. As a part of its international responsibilities, the
National Drug Enforcement Policy Board should participate in the
President's annual decision whether to suspend aid to drug
producing or transshipment countries. The Board should examine
the drug control efforts made by each foreign nation and make a
suitable recommendation to the President for his ultimate
decision. </p>

<p>3. The willingness of a country to engage in and actively
implement drug-related extradition and mutual assistance treaties
should be a primary consideration in the ultimate U.S. policy
decision regarding foreign assistance to that country. </p>

<p>4. The Departments of State and Defense should continue their
programs of economic and security assistance with emphasis on
assisting those foreign governments making concerted efforts to
control their drug problems. </p>

<p>5. The United States should continue to help producer and
trafficking nations develop prevention and education programs
aimed at drug abuse within these countries. </p>

<p>Source Country Crop Control </p>

<p>1. In light of restrictions inherent in international crop
control efforts, the Board should initiate a thorough
cost/benefit analysis of the entire history of those efforts by
the United States. If justified by such an analysis, the
Department of State, through its Bureau of International
Narcotics Matters (BINM), should initiate or intensify crop
control and plant eradication programs selectively and
judiciously in those countries where the political and economic
climates make it probable that crop eradication programs will
succeed. </p>

<p>2. The Department of State should establish and present to the
Policy Board a specific formula for triggering the cut-off of
foreign aid provided for in the &quot;Diplomacy Against
Drugs&quot; amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. </p>

<p>3. Narcotics Assistance Unit positions must be recognized by
the State Department as priority Foreign Service assignments. The
State Department should establish a select group of professional
Narcotics Officers to fill those positions, and should ensure
that those positions are fully integrated into the career
advancement structure within the Foreign Service. </p>

<p>4. BINM should expand the range of possibilities under
consideration as alternatives to illicit drug cultivation for
source country farmers and include such options as mining,
petroleum production, and light industry, where feasible. </p>

<p>Reducing Demand for Drugs </p>

<p>1. A thorough review of the current budgetary allotments for
anti-drug efforts, now contemplated by the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board, should be placed at the top of the
agenda of the Board immediately. If that review indicates that
greater Federal resources should be devoted to programs to reduce
demand, the Board should pursue appropriate action without
hesitation. </p>

<p>2. A portion of the Federal government's asset forfeiture
fund, derived from drug cases, should be devoted to programs to
reduce demand in whatever proportion is indicated by the review
recommended above. Funding to reduce demand should include a
responsible contribution to the States for their own programs in
this area. However, any funding directed to the States should be
made contingent upon their vigorous pursuit of such programs, and
after a reasonable grace period, as determined by the Board or by
Congress, funding should be denied to any State failing this
requirement. Failure to enact State electronic surveillance
measures and asset forfeiture provisions, with the proceeds
thereof directed to anti-drug programs, should constitute per se
failure. </p>

<p>3. The President should direct the heads of all Federal
agencies to formulate immediately clear policy statements, with
implementing guidelines, including suitable drug testing
programs, expressing the utter unacceptability of drug abuse by
Federal employees. State and local governments and leaders in the
private sector should support unequivocally a similar policy that
any and all use of drugs is unacceptable. Government contracts
should not be awarded to companies that fail to implement drug
programs, Including suitable drug testing. No Federal, State, or
local government funds should go directly or indirectly to
programs that counsel &quot;responsible&quot; drug use or condone
illicit drug use in any way. Laws in certain States which
&quot;decriminalized&quot; the possession of marijuana constitute
a form of such condonation, and should be reconsidered. </p>

<p>4. States that have not already done so should enact and
enforce laws prohibiting the sale of drug paraphernalia. </p>

<p>5. The States should be required to report information about
their prevention and treatment programs to the National Institute
on Drug Abuse. With this information, and reports obtained from
private programs, NIDA will be better able to identify the best
prevention and treatment programs and to develop and disseminate
standards and guidelines for such programs to the States. The
States should, in turn, provide this information to all groups
engaged in prevention, treatment, and related research. </p>

<p>6. Consistent with identified measures of success, State
governments should establish credentialing standards for
prevention and treatment programs. They should further require
that all elementary, junior high, and high schools within the
State Include drug abuse prevention programs in their curricula,
designed in a manner consistent with such credentialing
standards. State funding should be made available to assure the
proper training of educators assigned to such programs. </p>

<p>7. Every employer, public and private, and public education
institutions at all levels should have clearly-stated policies
prohibiting drug use, possession of drugs, or being under the
influence of drugs on their premises. The consequences of
violating these prohibitions should be clearly explained. </p>

<p>8. Government and private sector employers who do not already
require drug testing of job applicants and current employees
should consider the appropriateness of such a testing program. </p>

<p>9. State and local law enforcement authorities should enforce
more vigorously the laws prohibiting possession of drugs, and
State legislatures should ensure that enforcement agencies have
the necessary resources to do so. Such resources can be funded in
large part, if not entirely, through effective asset forfeiture
programs. </p>

<p>10. Uniform and rational sentencing for drug offenses is
essential. Such a system should provide a sentence of probation
and a fine for a first offense involving mere possession of
drugs. The terms of probation should include a requirement to
remain drug-free to be verified, if necessary, through periodic
drug testing. A second offense for possession of drugs should
result in a jail sentence or mandatory treatment or fines or all
three. </p>

<p>11. The media and entertainment industries should carefully
review their portrayals of drug use and its consequences and
ensure their accuracy. </p>

<p>12. Health professionals should be thoroughly trained to
identify and counsel drug abusers. </p>

<p>13. Relying on the task force approach which law enforcement
officials have used successfully, parents, churches, schools,
civic organizations and business associations should form
community task forces to provide a unified front against drugs. </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>The recommendations made here have not been reached
carelessly. They are the result of months of concerted research
and analysis, documented in the body of the report. Although some
recommendations reach to the most fundamental levels of
government agency operation and community life, they have been
presented only after consideration of every identifiable option. </p>

<p>The depth of concern expressed in this report is not the
result of any preordained strategy. Rather, it reflects this
Commission's recognition, based on objective evidence, that we
are confronted with a national crisis. Every course of action,
including a failure to act at all, has a natural consequence. The
recommendations made here are those actions deemed most effective
in promoting a national campaign against drugs at all levels of
society.<br>
