<H2>European Data Protection - Against the Internet?</H2>
<br>
<H3>Frank A. Koch</H3>

<br>

Conference on Advanced Surveillance Technologies        
<br>
Copenhagen, <br>
4 September 1995<br>
<br><br>


<br></CENTER>

<B>1.  The Conflict between the freedom of the net and data protection</B><br><br>

The Internet is the paradigm of an open, interconnected and worldwide set of information nets. There is no centralized agency, organisation or whatever institution controlling the net. You can secure your own system by building a firewall around it but there is no firewall around the whole Internet or even around parts of it, especially not around the territory of the European Union (EU).
<P>


Data Protection according to the Directive 95/45/EC  -  adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU  ( Official Journal No. L 281 ,  23.11.1995, p. 31 )  -   requires control over the medium available for transfers of personal data, the recipients of these data and the way those data are used. The open structure of Internet seems to be quite incompatible with these requirements.
<P>


If you talk to system operators about this problem, in most cases you get the answer that every "sysop" has to take care about his own system determining who is allowed to access his system or who might be recipient of personal data transferred from the sysops' system.   I  am  not absolutely sure whether this idea of free operations in a free net (voiced even by some IBM representatives) might ever work. 
<P>


But even if so, free transfer of personal data is against the law, at least against the new European Directive on Data Protection to be transformed into the law of the Member States of the EU until 23.11.1998 at the latest.     From that data protection point of view the Internet is an uncontrollable data haven to be excluded from any transfers of personal data except some very strict requirement outlined at the end of this papers are met.


<P>

We therefore have to take a closer look at the regulations of the Directive. By doing so one can show, I think, that at least some of the regulations contain principles which any responsible system operator had to comply with anyway.
<P>


Countries outside the EU are defined as third countries in the reading of the Directive. This even holds for Norway and Switzerland though the data protection legislation of these countries is equivalent to that of the EU. Data transfers are allowed only to those countries which "ensure an adequate level of protection" (Art.25 sect. 1 Directive) compared to the standards of the EU Member States..
<P>


The Member States of the EU have to assess the level  of  protection  afforded  by the third country  "in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer or a set of data transfer operations" (Art. 25 sect. 2 Directive)  before any transfer of personal data is taking place. The Directive makes clear that particular consideration should be given to the "nature of the data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations, the country of origin and the country of final destination" (!), "the rules of law, both general and sectoral, in force in the third country in question and the professional rules and security measures which are complied with in that country" (Art.25 sect.2).
<P>


If anything is clear from this lenghty paragraph it seems to be that you cannot do such an in-depth-assessment just by controlling your  system and the individuals you plan to communicate with on your own. What you need is an elaborated policy of such assessments formulated and executed by the Member States themselves. Data protection therefore cannot be reduced to some rules to be imposed on and followed by system operators alone.
<P>



                                                                                                                                 
<B>2. Restricting access to and disclosure of data</B>
<P>


Any "natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data" qualifies for being a "controller" in the sence of the Directive (of Art.2 lit.(d)).
<P>


Each such controller will be obliged to "implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against".... "unauthorized  disclosure or access in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing" (Art.17 sect. 1).


<P>


Therefore any uncontrolled  logging in of a third-country-recipient not identified in advance and/or from third countries into the part of a system where personal data are stored is unlawful under the Directive.  System operators have to make sure that only identified and legitimized users may access those parts of the system or be recipients of personal data to be disclosed. There can be therefore  no  free   Internet or any  other  Datahighway   access to personal data in any system on the territory of the EU.  Any anonymous- or guest-account giving access to such data therefore has to be blocked.
<P>


This point granted every "sysop" processing any personal data of users or other data subjects has to control who is logging into his system and to find out in advance and authenticate the user identity and country  where the user resides, what kind of data might be disclosed to this user and in what way the recipient may use the data transferred during which period. The examination requires case-by-case-decisions and cannot be done by an automated routine.<P>



<B>3. Informing data persons about data transfers and rights </B>
<P>


Controllers as defined by the Directive must provide a data subject (i.e. any identified or identifiable person) from whom data relating to himself are collected at least with informations on the recipients or categories of recipients of the data and on the existence of the right of access to and the right to rectify the data concerning him (Art.10  lit.(c)).
<P>


If there is no guaranteed way the data subject can exercise these rights in the recipient countries outside the EU the data transferral will be unlawful because the data are leaking into countries without comparable standards of data protection thereby violating the data subject's rights guaranteed under Art.12. It is  n o t   in the sole discretion of the system operator to decide whether a country has introduced an adequate level of data protection. The Member States of the EU themselves are obliges to examine the adequacy and to take measures necessary to prevent the transfer of protected data to countries not ensuring an adequate level of protection (Art.25 sect.4).
<P>


The Member States therefore - and controllers as well - have to take all measures necessary to make sure that personal data needing protection are not transferred into communication nets from which transfers into those countries cannot prevented. 
<P>


The Directive, seen in this way, is fencing in the territory of the EU. No controller is allowed to use nets for personal data transfers if that net transgresses, by what technical means ever,  EU borders and makes a country-related control impossible. And that is exactly what the Internet does. Using Internet or subnets thereof  - and even the more recent Intranets - or nets comparable to the Internet for transferring personal data or even for giving mere access to personal data bases might open Pandora's data box and therefore will be violating the forthcoming  European law on data protection.
<P>



                                                                                                                                 

<B>4. No data transfer to recipients without representatives within the EU</B>
<P>


And there is one further hurdle only few third-country-recipients can surmount at the moment. If a controller established outside the territory of the EU Member States makes use of equipment, automated or otherwise, situated on the territory of at least one of the said Member States the controller must designate a representative established on the territory of that Member State, without prejudice to legal actions which could be initiated against the controller himself (Art.4 sect.1 lit. (  c) and sect. 2).  Now any natural or legal  is to be regarded as controller  in the language of the Directive who determines the purpose and means of  (his) processing of personal data (see Art. 2 lit. (d)). Furthermore the Directive defines any collecting, recording, retrieving, storing and using of personal data as "processing" in the aforementioned sense.  So any recipient storing received personal data and determining the purpose and means of their further use is to be regarded as "controller" under the Directive. 
<P>


If any such "making use of equipment" is to be understood as online-connecting to a system, logging into it and downloading data files from that system, then any such transfer of personal data requires that the recipient as such a controller outside the EU territory in advance designates a representative within the Member State where the data transfer is to be done. To my knowledge until to date, there are not too many outside controllers  fulfilling those requirements. What follows from that for EU controllers is that only those non-EU users/sysops qualify for being a legal recipient of personal data who have designated a representative within the Member State - even if the recipient state has an adequate level of data protection. 
<P>



<B>5. Controlling what the recipient is doing with the data</B>
<P>


One final point should be stressed:
<P>


The recipient of personal data is not free in utilizing the personal data received - even if the processing of those data transferrals itself is compatible with the Directive.
<P>


The controller will be obliged to find out for each data transfer
<P>


 -  the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations,<br>
 -  the country of final destination (!)  of the data,<br>
 -  the rules of law in force in the third country and<br>
 -  the professional rules and security measures (!) which are complied with in the third country    (Art.25 sect.2) and implemented by the recipient.<br><br>


<B>6. Liability</B>
<br><br>
Any damage a data subject suffers from an unlawful transborder data transfer into a third country may entitle the data subject to receive compensation from the controller transferring the data to the third-country-recipient (cf Art.23 sect.1).
<br><br>

                                                                                                                                 
<B>7. Summary and conclusion</B>
<br><br>
Personal data may not be freely transferred worldwide through the Internet, at least not when EU borders. Unlimited access to and disclosure of personal data is unlawful. As a system operator within the EU you may transfer personal data to recipients outside the EU borders if
<br><br>
(a)   the recipient of these data has designated a representative in the Member State from where you want to start the data transfer  a n d <br><br>
(b)    you can ensure that the data protection legislation in the recipient state is equivalent to that in your Member State  a n d<br><br>

(c)    you can make sure that nobody unidentified or not entitled to do so is able to get access to the part of your system where personal data are stored or can benefit from personal data disclosed to him   a n d
<br><br>
(d)    you have informed the data subject (from whom you store personal data) of the recipients of these data and the rights the data subject has to access the system of the recipient and to demand reatification of his data if necessary   a n d
<br><br>
(e)    you find out in what way the recipient uses the data during what time, what security measurements have been implemented by the recipient and whether there is a second recipient as final destination to whom apply rules (a) - (e) of course.
<br><br>
All these requirements you have to fulfil before   starting the transfer operation. In that case and under those tightly defined conditions you may use the Internet for transferring personal data but even then at the risk of being liable in case you did not find out  the country of final destination  or cannot prove that you are not responsible for an event causing damage to the data subject.

***********************************************************************

 
Dispatches
 
13th March 1996
 
Back on the Torture Trail
 
 
Commentary          In the autumn of 1994 these men were
                    tortured with electro shock batons in the
                    Lebanon.
 
                    It happened in the Lebanese Ministry of
                    Defence in Beirut.
 
                    The men were stripped naked and made to
                    stand for days with their legs wide apart.
 
                    They have agreed to reenact this horrifying
                    experience for Dispatches but they don't
                    want to be identified.
 
Lebanese Man:       They use the electro-shock sometimes in our
                    eyes. What you feel is terrible, you fell
                    like it's hell, you feel lightning in your
                    eyes and your hands, all your body is
                    shaking, you feel that you want to die, it's
                    better maybe.
 
Q:                  And how long did this go on for ?
 
 
Lebanese Man:       The first four, five days everybody goes
                    through this. We didn't know which
                    instrument they were using in the electric
                    shock and one day when my friend were
                    standing near the wall they came and they
                    tried to shot him in his testicles...
 
Commentary          The electro shock baton has been described
                    as the universal tool of the torturer.
 
Lebanese Man:       And they came like this and they tried to
                    shock him in his testicles and so he saw
                    from underneath the blindfold this stick
                    which give us all this pain.

Commentary          At the very moment the men were being
                    tortured in the Lebanon, Dispatches was
                    negotiating to buy electro-shock weapons
                    from the Royal Ordnance Division of British
                    Aerospace, Britain's leading arms
                    manufacturer. They were being shown to us by
                    middle-man, Gerry Hall.
 
                    Royal Ordnance salesman Philip Morris
                    offered us millions of pounds worth of
                    electro-shock batons and shields while we
                    were posing as businessmen linked to the
                    Lebanese government.
 
                    We discussed the deal at a meeting with
                    Martin Trengove, the head of Royal
                    Ordnance's Middle East Sales.
 
Martin Trengove:    Before we start getting involved in multi
                    million dollar things.....
 
Commentary          The companies we exposed on The Torture
                    Trail subsequently denied what millions of
                    viewers had seen with their own eyes.
 
                    Frank Stott of ICL Technical Plastics,
                    offered to sell us millions of pounds of
                    electro-shock weapons but after Dispatches
                    was shown, his company said it had never
                    sold them to anyone.
 
                    The boss of International Procurement
                    Services, Gerry Hall, helped to put together
                    the British Aerospace deal, but after
                    Dispatches Gerry Hall said he had never sold
                    electro-shock kit in his life.
 
 
BAe / Morris offer
                    BAe offered us over $3.62 million dollars
                    worth of weapons. After Dispatches it
                    denounced what it called our 'subterfuge
                    journalism', and also said that it had
                    "never sold electro-shock weapons"...
 
                    but the fiercest reaction came, however from
                    Michael Heseltine's DTI. The then President
                    of the Board of Trade, accused us of
                    'scaremongering', of 'contrived allegations'
                    and of 'making a story that otherwise did
                    not exist'.
 
Commentary          The government rejected Amnesty
                    International's demand for an enquiry into
                    what it described as 'grave and serious
                    charges' [made by Dispatches] and
                    Heseltine's ministers leapt to the defence
                    of the companies we exposed.
 
Lord Dubs:          May I ask the Minister to look again at this
                    whole issue with particular reference to
                    electric shock batons ?
 
Earl Ferrers:       My Lords, I really do think the noble Lord,
                    Lord Dubs I must say to him that he should
                    not take every single television programme
                    at it's face value. There are certain people
                    who are prepared to make programmes and who
                    are prepared to entrap people in to saying
                    things and then to put those on as
                    programmes in which they purport to show
                    that people are behaving, in an untoward
                    way. I have explained that the result of
                    that particular programme involves 3
                    particular firms and those firms have
                    acquitted themselves reasonably.
 
Pierre Sane:        If that behaviour is reasonable then we
                    certainly have a different understanding of
                    what reasonable behaviour is. Reasonable
                    behaviour cannot be a behaviour that leads
                    to undermining the system of international
                    protection of human rights. Reasonable
                    behaviour cannot be a behaviour where using
                    the loophole that exists in the legislation,
                    a company will make benefits as a result of
                    trading in weapons that are misused by
                    security forces to torture people. This is
                    money which is earned on the blood of
                    victims.
 
Commentary          The public outcry that followed 'The Torture
                    Trail' was a mixture if shock and disbelief
                    that the government could possibly allow
                    this to happen.... but our sources told us
                    that it was still very much 'business as
                    usual' in the British torture trade.
 
Robin Ballantyne:   You've got companies now setting themselves
                    up as what is known as "One-Stop Shops".
                    They may not make all the products, they may
                    not necessarily have them all in stock, but
                    they will arrange to have them shipped from
                    all the different, all four corners of the
                    planet to wherever they need to go.  But the
                    important thing is to follow the money. If
                    the money comes back to Great Britain, then
                    Britain needs to take some of that
                    responsibility.
 
 
Switzerland
 
Commentary          We set up a 'Dispatches' front company in
                    Switzerland, in Basle on the Rhein, where
                    France, Germany and Switzerland meet. Our
                    company was called Eric Lopez Associates and
                    we contacted 8 British 'internal security'
                    companies saying we wanted to buy a package
                    of riot control equipment, that included 300
                    electro-shock batons- initially only two
                    companies refused.
 
 
Martyn Gregory      None of the British companies that quoted
                    for electro-shock equipment bothered to
                    check out the credentials of Eric Lopez
                    Associates. Had the done so, they would of
                    course found out Eric Lopez does not exist.
                    They might also have found out that their
                    quotations were being received on a public
                    fax machine here at a train station in
                    Switzerland. And they were being read not by
                    Eric Lopez, but by Dispatches.
 
 
Commentary          Some of the companies warned us that it was
                    illegal to sell electro-shock batons in
                    Britain, but their faxes reassured us that
                    the weapons would never have to touch
                    British soil. The companies' enthusiasm to
                    deal with us was clear in their sales patter
                    on the phone.
 
                    TELEPHONE ACTUALITY
 
Simon Telling, CCS: Its obviously illegal for us to sell from
                    the UK so uhm in theory what we would do is,
                    we would either send everything from New
                    York to Switzerland or the destination that
                    you requires it's entirely up to you.
 
 
Bill Buttermer:     No problem we can quote for the sticks no
                    problem.
                    It's an electronic, it gives him a huge
                    electrical shock low low current, high
                    voltage.
 
Q:                  Non lethal though
 
A:                  I mean that's the whole object otherwise you
                    just shoot the guy. This is basically to
                    make him behave himself.
 
Bauer, CDS:         These are really good quality, electronical,
                    and a proper rocker switch in the handle. I
                    mean there's what's known as a hot coil, it
                    isn't a cheap piece of shit. You can
                    actually use these to hit people with they
                    don't fall apart like some of this stuff
                    they are decent quality.
 
 
Commentary          Companies were not put off when we said our
                    client was the Zairean government which has
                    an established reputation for torture.
                    President Mobuto's police favour electro-
                    shock batons for torture because they don't
                    leave marks and their victims don't have
                    scars to show Amnesty International if they
                    survive. Roberto a refugee in Zaire who was
                    tortured.
 
Roberto:            This time they touched me again with the
                    electronic baton but in the nape of the neck
                    and at the base of the groin (genital area)
                    and it hurt so much that even now when I
                    speak it is difficult to keep my head still
                    as the back of my neck hurts very much.
 
Commentary          The first company we approached to buy
                    electro-shock batons for Zaire was SDMS
                    Security Products Ltd. It operates from tiny
                    premises on a single floor immediately above
                    the tanning shop in the Fulham Road in
                    London.
 
                    SDMS is a member of the Defence
                    Manufacturers Association and one of its
                    Directors has an OBE.
 
                    A source in the Ministry of Defence alerted
                    us to the company's brochure which
                    advertises electro-shock weapons.
 
Intercontinental
Hotel
Commentary          We invited SDMS's chairman, David Knights to
                    meet us in the Intercontinental Hotel in
                    London. We said we here on a brief visit
                    from Switzerland. We secretly filmed our
                    meeting with Knights. He was confident he
                    could provide us with electro-shock
                    weapons...
 
 
David Knights:      We'll provide you with a sample in complete
                    confidence.
                    What would happen is... We would prefer to
                    ship them direct to your client, if that is
                    possible, particularly if it is coming from
                    South Africa and the client is Zaire that
                    will save time obviously. And erm, we cab
                    get it done through England, but we don't
                    want to do it technically the goods are
                    illegal here.. 
 
 
Commentary          300 Shock batons were included in the riot
                    gear package Knights offered to sell us.
 
                    He also sent us details of previous 
                    electro-shock sales made by SDMS and its
                    associates in South Africa. They claimed to
                    have sold them around the world to countries
                    including Libya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and
                    Angola in Africa. And Mexico, Peru, Burma
                    and Indonesia. All of which are known to be
                    torturing states.
 
                    After Mr Knights turned down a request for
                    a formal interview we decided to confront
                    him.
 
Doorstep
Martyn Gregory:     Good Morning is Mr Knights here?
 
Female:             Yes he is.
 
Martyn Gregory:     Ah, Mr Knights good morning.
 
Mr Knights:         Good morning.
 
Martyn Gregory:     Martyn Gregory from Channel 4 Dispatches.
                    I'd like to ask you.
 
Mr Knights:         No
 
Martyn Gregory:     I'd like ti ask you why you sell electro-
                    shock batons.
 
Commentary          Mr Knights appeared reluctant to answer our
                    questions.
 
Mr Knights:         No, Get out.
 
Martyn Gregory:     Sorry ?
 
Mr Knights:         Out.
 
Martyn Gregory:     Don't assault my cameraman, I don't think it
                    will do you very much good at all.
 
Mr Knights:         Do you mind getting out of here?
 
Martyn Gregory:     Well I do actually because I want to ask you
                    some questions.
 
Commentary          This was to prove difficult as my camera
                    team and I soon found ourselves on opposite
                    sides of a firmly closed door.
 
                    I rejoined the crew 5 minutes later.
 
                    Knights now claims he doesn't deal in
                    electro-shock batons - just like the
                    businessmen we exposed a year ago.
 
                    Paddington Green police seized Gerry Hall's
                    electro-shock riot shield last year. He had
                    lied to us when he said he had permission
                    from the Home Office. None of the companies
                    we exposed then, including BAe, had the
                    necessary permission to hold or to sell
                    electro-shock weapons.
 
                    The police spoke ti us as potential
                    witnesses to the offence we had filmed, but
                    no prosecutions followed.
 
                    A serious rumpus ensued however as the BAe
                    salesman, lead the torture trail to a secret
                    at the heart of the biggest defence deal in
                    Britains history - the 20 billion
                    (Sterling) Al Yamamah deal between Britain
                    and Saudi Arabia. Philip Morris claimed it
                    included 8,000 electro-shock batons.
 
Morris at Star
Street
 
Philip Morris:      I've told you too much already by telling
                    you that we sold to the Saudi's... in any
                    numbers but if it's er... British Aerospace
                    have er you know the Al Yamamah programme
 
Martyn Gregory:     I do.
 
Philip Morris:      Have you heard about it, it just gets
                    swallowed up in things like that.
 
 
John Clarkson:      It just gets swallowed up.
 
Philip Morris:      That's right.
 
Commentary          Michael Heseltine signed the Al Yamamah deal
                    with the Saudi government when he was
                    Secretary of State for Defence.  It is
                    Britain's biggest ever arms deal and its
                    precise terms are a State secret.  British
                    Aerospace is the main contractor on behalf
                    of the British government. The government
                    and the company firmly denied Morris's
                    claims that electro-shock weapons were sold
                    to the Saudis. Morris was suspended by BAe
                    in the row that followed 'Dispatches'
                    revelations, pending, BAe said, disciplinary
                    procedures against him and Trengove. BAe has
                    never revealed what action was taken.
 
 
Anne Gibson:        Dear Mr Butler after watching Channel 4's
                    Dispatches earlier this week I felt I had to
                    register my complete disgust how Britain
                    could endorse such goings on without turning
                    a hair.
 
Commentary          Ann Gibson was one of many Channel 4 viewers
                    who were shocked by Dispatches revelations
                    about the claims that torture weapons were
                    'swallowed up' in the Al Yamamah deal.
 
Anne Gibson:        I've never written to an MP before, so I was
                    quite amazed how the letters started
                    snowballing quite a few letters.
 
 
Commentary          The reply from her own MP, Peter Butler, was
                    remarkably frank; Dispatches, he wrote, had
                    told 'lies' and the film had been
                    'manufactured to serve the career interests
                    of the programme makers'. Butler had been
                    briefed by the DTI.
 
Anne Gibson:        When I got the reply I wasn't satisfied at
                    all, all they did was deny that anything
                    untoward had happened which seemed very
                    strange as we could see it happening on the
                    video film.
 
Commentary          Geoffrey Bindman, is one of Britain's
                    leading libel and human rights lawyers. He
                    successfully defended Clive Ponting the
                    civil servant who had been accused of
                    leaking secrets about the Falklands War. I
                    asked Bindman to study Heseltine's letters.
 
Bindman:            I would be hard put to it to find any
                    comparable example of cynical manipulation
                    and dishonesty on the part of government as
                    this one.
 
Commentary          Michael Hesletine won praise from Sir
                    Richard Scott into his arms to Iraq enquiry
                    because of his objections to signing Public
                    Interest Immunity Certificates that were
                    placed before him in the Matrix Churchill
                    case.
 
                    Yet in this instance Heseltine had signed
                    ill thought out letters about 'The Torture
                    Trail' that had originally been drafted by
                    a civil servant who gave no indication as to
                    whether he had actually watched the
                    programme. I started libel proceedings
                    against the government.
 
Bindman:            It was an attempt to rubbish the programme
                    and presumably from a government's point
                    view they were trying to use this as a means
                    of avoiding an investigation into the
                    allegations made in the programme.
 
Commentary          Rather than investigating our allegations
                    the authorities began to investigate us -
                    the programme makers. Shortly after I
                    started my legal action against the
                    government, the Ministry of Defence took
                    over the police investigation into the
                    offence that we had filmed. The Ministry of
                    Defence Police decided that it was me as
                    well as the businessmen Dispatches had
                    exposed who might have committed crimes.
                    They questioned me as a suspect rather than
                    as a witness.
 
Martyn Gregory:     I was interviewed by the Ministry of Defence
                    Police under caution in the presence of my
                    Solicitor.
 
                    They told me that because of my role as the
                    reporter on the Torture Trail I was being
                    interviewed as a suspect. They told me that
                    I could face the criminal charges of
                    handling electro-shock batons and also of
                    inciting BAe officials to break the firearms
                    act. If charged I could face a prison
                    sentence of up to 5 years.  We asked Michael
                    Portillo the Defence Secretary to be
                    interviewed on this programme to justify the
                    investigation and also the use of taxpayers
                    money on it. He replied that he couldn't
                    take part because it is an ongoing
                    investigation.
 
High Court
Commentary          Surprisingly the government did not even
                    submit a defence to my libel action, and
                    agreed to apologize in the High Court for
                    the letters signed by Michael Heseltine and
                    his ministers.
 
BBC 1 O'Clock News  The department of Trade and Industry has
                    agreed to pay 55,000 pounds (Sterling) in
                    libel damages in costs to a journalist after
                    it had accused him of making up evidence
                    about the sale of torture instruments by
                    British firms, The DTI accepted that the
                    allegations about the producer of the
                    Channel 4 documentary Dispatches were
                    untrue.
 
Commentary          The government conceded defeat as soon as
                    MPs returned to their constituencies for the
                    summer.
 
                    The Labour Party called for Michael
                    Heseltine and his ministers to personally
                    pay the total costs of the court case,
                    85,000 (Sterling), but the Prime Minister
                    insisted that the taxpayer would foot the
                    bill.
 
                    In its statement in the High Court, the
                    government apologised unreservedly for
                    accusing me of making up our expose of the
                    British Torture trade. It said that the
                    programme had been 'properly researched'.
 
                    but the government insisted however, that no
                    export regulations had been broken....
 
                    A week after it's libel defeat, however, the
                    government made an even more significant
                    admission....
 
                    Ian Taylor, one of the DTI ministers who
                    signed some of the libellous letters,
                    admitted that electronic batons had been
                    given a license in 1993 for shipment via the
                    UK.
 
                    This answer confirmed that, as well as
                    libelling me, Michael Heseltine's DTI had
                    been lying when it said that the trade in
                    electro-shock batons did not exist. The
                    trade does exist and the government knows it
                    exists.
 
Ann Clwyd:          In the months since the programme they have
                    given the impression that their hands are
                    clean that the export of electro-shock
                    batons was something very far away from them
                    and now suddenly they produce that answer.
 
Commentary          Ann Clwyd was the MP who extracted Ian
                    Taylor's admission. She has moved 4 Early
                    Day motions, signed  by hundreds of MPs, and
                    asked over 70 questions on issues raised by
                    The Torture Trail.
 
Ann Clwyd:          This is an interesting one asking the
                    President of the Board of Trade to list the
                    companies to which export licenses were
                    granted for the export of electronic batons
                    in the last 5 years.
 
Q:                  And what answer did they give you?
 
Ann Clwyd:          The first part of this question says it
                    could only be answered at disproportionate
                    cost.
 
Q:                  And that basically means that they're not
                    going to answer it does it?
 
Ann Clwyd:          That's right, they don't want to answer it.
 
Ann Clwyd:          I think there's an enormous cover up going
                    on and the government is deliberately
                    dragging it's feet. That's the conclusion
                    I've come to after a year of asking
                    questions.
 
Robert Jarman:      I think it was a naked political cover up.
                    I don't think that government wanted anybody
                    to get er, too close into the whole Al
                    Yamamah programme. I mean, it is of such
                    importance to the government that anybody
                    who criticises it or, indeed criticises er,
                    Saudi senior official dealings are - are
                    going to be stamped on fairly hard.
 
                    "... I think the programme in my opinion was
                    100% and that subsequent events have only
                    lent credibility to that view."
 
Commentary          'Subsequent events' appear to have left
                    Britain's arms dealers unchastened. This is
                    another British businessman prepared to
                    export electro-shock weapons to Zaire
                    despite Britain's official policy of
                    upholding human rights.
 
Bill Buttermer:     This sort of thing is really difficult to
                    get an export licence for.
 
Q:                  Why?
 
A:                  Human Rights, the way they look at is there
                    is a Zairean policeman wandering round the
                    streets giving all his fellow countryman an
                    english electro-shock and that is really bad
                    news.
 
Commentary          But we were about to find out how he quite
                    legally can sell electro-shock batons like
                    this to Zaire without any interference from
                    the British government.
 
 
Part 2
Mexico
Commentary          The Torture Trail has led us to the largest
                    city in the world. We've come to Mexico to
                    visit a factory which makes electro-shock
                    weapons described by human rights groups as
                    the universal tool of the torturer.
 
                    Dispatches journalist, Christopher Martin,
                    and myself are posing as British
                    businessmen. Our introduction to the Mexican
                    manufacturer came from a British company
                    based in Wiltshire. They also sent us
                    leaflets describing the batons we were about
                    to see.
 
Chat in Taxi
 
"Philip Anderson"   They are claiming to sell 5 of these batons
                    ranging from the 18 inch to the 36 inches.
 
"Jim Corkhill"      36 inches well that's 3 foot long.
 
"Philip Anderson"   And one of them has a spiral that runs down
                    the outside.
 
"Jim Corkhill"      But what voltage is this ?
 
"Philip Anderson"   They say that they are all 50,000 volts
                    which they claim to be safe humane.
 
Commentary          The Macoisa company in Mexico City operates
                    from behind a wrought iron grill and two
                    bomb proof doors.  Inside, they are very
                    keen to show us their range of electro-shock
                    weapons - its legal to make and sell them
                    here.
 
                    Each of these batons emits a charge of
                    40,000 volts... The shield has the same
                    voltage - the Americans classify this as a
                    torture shield.
 
                    Macoisa's boss, Alfredo Aguilla, is
                    confidant that he can export the batons on
                    behalf of his British client to anywhere we
                    chose....
 
Aguilla:            For Mexico government no problem, maybe in
                    your country you need a licence to import
                    but for an export license from Mexico we
                    don't have any trouble.
 
"Philip Anderson"   Even if it's a problem government no
                    problem?
 
"Jim Corkhill"      Bad human rights no problem?
 
Aguilla:            No, no problem.
 
"Jim Corkhill"      Well that's good because the Zairean's are
                    not well known for their human rights are
                    they?
 
Aguilla:            I think you don't have any trouble in that
                    respect.
 
"Philip Anderson"   Well the problem is the Zairean govt is not
                    so nice do you understand?
 
Aguilla:            Yes I understand.
 
Commentary          We were invited to test the 'universal tool
                    of the torturer ourselves'.
 
"Philip Anderson"   I heard you know in some places they use
                    them for interrogation.
 
Aguilla:            Sometime
 
"Philip Anderson"   And then it's dangerous ?
 
Aguilla:            Especially when you put here
 
"Philip Anderson"   Really and then what happens ?
 
Aguilla:            Real damage
 
"Philip Anderson"   So it's like torture like torture then ?
 
Aguilla:            Oh Yes.
 
Commentary          Aguilla is a former major in the Mexican
                    Army. He was proud to show us round his
                    electro-shock weapon factory.
 
                    Britain classifies these batons and shields
                    as weapons: Their possession or sale in the
                    UK carries a jail sentence of up to five
                    years, the same penalty as possession of an
                    AK 47 machine gun.
 
                    Aguilla was happy for us to film and chat to
                    the workers who appeared well aware of the
                    dangers of the products they were making....
 
                    We showed one of the Mexican shock batons to
                    Roberto. He was appalled that a British
                    company could be involved - the batons were
                    almost identical to the ones used to torture
                    him in Zaire.....
 
Roberto:            My reaction on discovering this this type of
                    weapon is I don't know (pause). I could
                    really call it something really horrible,
                    immoral because those people who make it for
                    torture they don't don't test it one their
                    own bodies and they don't know the pain it
                    causes. They do it to make other people
                    suffer quite simply to gain money. Its very
                    tragic.
 
Commentary          The British company that had set up our
                    contact in Mexico was Compass Safety
                    International, formerly known as Compass
                    Maritime. It is better known for selling
                    marine life - saving equipment like
                    navigational aids and life jackets.
 
                    but in London Compass Safety International
                    Managing Director, Bill Buttermer made it
                    clear that he could use Mexico to avoid
                    British export controls.....
 
Bill Buttermer:     You're not going to need an export license
                    as they're coming straight out of Mexico.
 
"Philip Anderson"   And is Zaire going to present a problem at
                    all with this ?
 
Bill Buttermer:     Mexico is no problem. You said West Africa
                    and I thought it would be Nigeria.
 
"Philip Anderson"   That might have presented a problem ?
 
Bill Buttermer:     It could have done but it wasn't even going
                    to present a problem with Nigeria.
 
"Philip Anderson"   Because you could have done it from Mexico?
 
Bill Buttermer:     Yeah absolutely.
 
"Philip Anderson"   So basically you can do anything from there
                    you can circumvent every
 
Bill Buttermer:     Sure, If you can get the kit.
 
Commentary          Compass Safety International offered to sell
                    us 300 electro-shock batons at $25,000 (US),
                    and it said the riot gear we requested would
                    come from a Scottish company, ICL Technical
                    Plastics, in Glasgow. Buttermer told us that
                    our contact there would be none other than
                    Frank Stott, an old friend of the Torture
                    Trail.
 
                    Stott is currently under investigation by
                    the Strathclyde police after showing us a
                    terrifying range of electro-shock kit on
                    'Dispatches' last year.
 
                    He had boasted of British government
                    support...
 
Frank Stott:        The government are very keen that we get
                    involved in the export business of this kind
                    of thing.
 
Commentary          ... like Bill Buttermer of Compass Safety,
                    he didn't really want to know who he was
                    selling these weapons to ...
 
Frank Stott:        With this sort of kit to be honest I tend
                    not to ask too many question. What they're
                    doing, where it's going.
 
Frank Davies:       I suppose it's just business really ?
 
Frank Stott:        They're all grown men they know what they're
                    doing.... although I sometimes wonder about
                    that.
 
COPEX 94
 
Commentary          We had first met Stott and some of his
                    'grown men' at the COPEX exhibition. The
                    Covert Operational and Procurement
                    Exhibition is reputedly Britain's most
                    tightly guarded internal security fair held.
                    It's held at Sandown Park race course every
                    year.
 
                    In 1994 we filmed secretly for the first
                    time. There were no torture weapons on
                    display because they are illegal, but we
                    exposed it as a good place for starting
                    deals in weapons that can be used for
                    torture.
 
                    We encountered Stott who briefed us on his
                    electro-shock weapons and later offered to
                    sell us nearly 2 million (sterling) worth.
 
                    In the bar we continued our negotiations
                    with the Royal Ordnance Division of British
                    Aerospace and Gerry Hall for an electro-
                    shock deal worth 3 and a half million
                    dollars.
 
                    Copex 95 was greeted by demonstrations and
                    protests for the first time in its history.
 
                    After The Torture Trail's exposure of COPEX
                    1994, widespread protests in Germany had led
                    to the cancellation of COPEX Bonn last
                    summer.
                    At Sandown Park, demonstrators layed seige
                    to COPEX 95.
 
CAAT Organiser:     Can you just join the blockade just come
                    through. Sit down.
 
Jen Parker:         "I really just do not understand how they
                    can claim it is not an arms fair and that
                    they are not involved in promoting the arms
                    trade because they are"
 
Commentary          Some of the demonstrators had been sued by
                    COPEX after writing to Sandown Park pleading
                    with it to refuse to host the exhibition.
                    One of those sued was 78 year old Quaker,
                    Alan Staley.
 
Alan Staley:        I'd like to go in because I want to have a
                    word with Commander Julian Winkley who is
                    boss of this outfit because he has issued a
                    writ against me and I would like to discuss
                    it with him, to find out why he has done
                    it... and I think this is an issue we could
                    discuss man to man.
 
Policeman:          I think that's an issues for you and him all
                    I know is that you're not allowed past these
                    gates at the moment.
 
COPEX demo
Commentary          COPEX boss 'Commander' Julian Winkley turns
                    out ti be a former drama teacher. At COPEX
                    95 he became photographer Julian Winkley. He
                    busied himself taking snaps of demonstrators
                    being turfed out of Sandown Park. He claims
                    COPEX is open to the public but this is not
                    true ?
 
Commentary          Even Ann Clwyd MP couldn't get in.
 
Ann Clwyd:          All I want is permission to come round the
                    fair.
 
Guard:              He hasn't granted you that.
 
Ann Clywd:          So I as a member of Parliament can no come
                    in? 
 
Guard:              That's what he said and I can only reiterate
                    what he said to me.
 
Ann Clwyd:          Thank you very much.
 
Commentary          Dispatches was refused entry to COPEX 95 but
                    this man was inside. He changes his
                    appearance frequently to gain entry.
 
Robin Ballantyne:   You have to become part of the business so
                    I'll shave I'll have a suit you have to look
                    the part. I talk to people at their stalls,
                    uhm, I sit in bars and listen to people
                    basically just gathering intelligence on the
                    trade and what's being made.
 
Q:                  Can you understand why COPEX keep the Press,
                    demonstrators and members of Parliament out?
 
A:                  Absolutely, if they've got people coming
                    from torturing states they don't certainly
                    don't want to be seen and have their
                    photographs put across the world's press.
 
Q:                  Who did you see in there ?
 
A:                  There was quite a large delegation from
                    Indonesia at least 7 or 8 people and they
                    were being shown round by a British
                    gentleman because they actually had
                    Indonesia written on their badges.
 
Commentary          The indonesians at COPEX were in fact from
                    the crack military unit Kopassus.  Its
                    soldiers were involved in this notorious
                    massacre. These pictures alerted the world
                    to the Indonesian army's atrocities in East
                    Timor.
 
                    Kopassus was present in the cemetery on that
                    day. The Indonesian Embassy confirmed that
                    Kopassus representatives were flown in from
                    Jakarta specifically to attend COPEX 95.
 
Pierre Sane:        KOPASSUS has a lot of blood on its hands.
                    The Indonesian Army units and KOPASSUS have
                    been involved in not just extra judicial
                    executions, but also er torture,
                    disappearances, arbitrary detention,
                    incommunicado er, detention.
 
Commentary          We had spotted an Iranian delegation at
                    COPEX 94 as they inspected state of the art
                    covert surveillance equipment.
                    Unsurprisingly the government attempted to
                    distance itself from COPEX when challenged
                    in parliament as Britain has a complete ban
                    on military sales to Iran...
 
Mullin:             What on earth are we doing to allowing an
                    delegation from Iran to attend arms fairs
                    here ? He might also have found equipment on
                    sale or available in that exhibition capable
                    of use in torture. Does the Minister think
                    that sponsoring events of that kind
                    represent the best use of British tax payers
                    money ?
 
Freeman:            This is a private exhibition as I understand
                    it there is no tax payers money involved.
 
Commentary          This Defence Minister was being less than
                    accurate. This written answer from trade
                    minister, Philip Oppenheimer, shows that the
                    government has spent over 81,000 (sterling)
                    of taxpayers money on travel grants to help
                    British companies attend the 6 COPEX
                    exhibitions abroad.
 
                    Dispatches discovered further compelling
                    evidence that DTI advice on electro-shock
                    sales was being distributed while Michael
                    Heseltine and his ministers were assuring
                    everyone that the trade did not exist.
 
                    This report three quarter of which was
                    funded by the DTI contains advice to British
                    companies on where to sell electro-shock
                    weapons in the Gulf where torture is
                    widespread.
                    The section on the oil rich micro-state of
                    Qatar where floggings are commonplace and
                    beheading occurs, contains the following
                    advice:
 
                    "Qatar ... key market point ... Special
                    Forces (requirements include) electronic
                    batons".
 
Grosvenot GVs
Commentary          Compass Safety's Bill Buttermer also claimed
                    the government had helped him get around
                    parliament's restrictions on the sale of
                    internal security to Indonesia before he
                    joined the company.....
 
Bill Buttermer:     We had something called a fragmentation
                    grenade which was basically anti-personnel,
                    and it shoots a crowd of ball bearings out
                    of a discharger on a vehicle so it's great
                    for anti ambush and that sort of thing, but
                    we couldn't get an export license for that
                    but we said hang on you know we've just sold
                    them tanks with high explosives but they
                    said that's for defence but this is for
                    internal security.
 
Q:                  So they never got them in the end ?
 
A:                  Shortly after that someone in the Ministry
                    of Defence said well why don't you call them
                    anti ambush grenades?  Change the name so we
                    thought that's a good idea so we put it
                    another way anti ambush grenades and got it
                    just like that.
 
                    COMPASS STATEMENT
 
Commentary          When Dispatches confronted Compass with the
                    evidence of its electro-shock offers, the
                    chairman, Don May immediately withdrew the
                    offer. He said he 'abominates the deliberate
                    infliction of pain on a helpless person',
                    and announced that Mr Buttermer had
                    resigned.
 
Roberto in cell     It was the former managing director of
                    Compass Safety who had shown us the most
                    profitable route on the Torture Trail - off
                    shore production. The profits come back to
                    Britain and no-one raises awkward questions
                    about human rights ....
 
Pierre Sane:        It is not just good enough to prohibit the
                    manufacturing of this equipment in the UK or
                    the sale or possession of this equipment in
                    the UK. Legislation should also prohibit
                    companies from engaging in offshore sale of
                    this equipment. Why is it prohibited in the
                    UK in terms of use. Its because this
                    equipment can be misused to cause extreme
                    pain and suffering and even to cause death.
 
Martyn Gregory      We started off on the TORTURE TRAIL nearly
                    2 years ago to investigate a trade that the
                    British Government claims does not exist but
                    we found a string of British companies
                    prepared to sell these weapons and some
                    evidence of active support from the British
                    Government.  By using countries like Mexico
                    to make electro-shock batons, the companies
                    can do their deals and the British
                    Government can claim that no export
                    regulations have been broken. They haven't
                    it's all perfectly legal and very
                    profitable. Britain will retain it's status
                    as a key provider of weapons to torturing
                    states around the world unless and until the
                    British Government puts a stop to this
                    morally indefensible state of affairs.
 
                    THE END

<H2></CENTER><B>AFRICA</B></H2>
<B>ANGOLA:</B> The Government maintains a sophisticated security apparatus dedicated to surveillance, monitoring, and wire tapping of certain groups, including journalists, opposition party leaders, members and suspected sympathizers of UNITA, National Assembly deputies, and foreign diplomats. The law requires judicial warrants for searches of private homes, and that law is generally respected in practice. <BR>
<BR>
<B>BENIN:</B> The Constitution prohibits such practices, and government authorities generally respect these prohibitions.<P>
<B>BOTSWANA:</B> The Constitution provides for the protection of privacy and the security of the person, and government authorities generally respect these rights.<P>
<B>BURKINA FASO: </B>The Constitution provides for these rights, and, in practice, the authorities generally do not interfere in the daily lives of ordinary citizens. In national security cases, however, the law permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of telephones and private correspondence without a warrant. Under normal circumstances, by law, homes may be searched only with the authority of a warrant issued by the Minister of Justice except in certain cases, such as houses of prostitution and gambling dens. Such warrants must be executed during "legal hours," defined as between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.<P>
<B>BURUNDI: </B>The Constitution provides for the right to privacy, and the authorities generally respect the law requiring search warrants. Security forces, however, can monitor telephones and are commonly assumed to do so.<P>
<B>CAMEROON:</B> Both invasions of the home and tampering with correspondence are illegal, but there were numerous credible reports that police and gendarmes harassed citizens, conducted searches without warrants, and seized mail. There were numerous credible reports that the Government kept some opposition activists and dissidents under surveillance.<P>
<B>CAPE VERDE:</B> The Constitution prohibits such practices, and government authorities respect these prohibitions in practice.<P>
<B>CENTRAL AFRICAN REP.</B>: The Government on rare occasion abused the law which prohibits invasion of the home without a warrant in civil and criminal cases. Police did, however, use Title IV of the Penal Code, governing certain political and security cases, which allows them to search private property without special authorization. The Government also monitored the telephones of some opposition figures.<P>
<B>CHAD:</B> The Transitional Charter provides for the right to privacy of home and correspondence and freedom from arbitrary search. The Penal Code requires that authorities conduct searches of homes only during daylight hours and with a legal warrant. In practice, security forces ignored these provisions and conducted extrajudicial searches at any time. Chief offenders were the ANS and gendarmerie, who mounted illegal operations against opposition figures, and the army, which invaded villages in areas of internal conflict, in many cases abusing their victims and extorting goods and money from them (see Section 1.g.). <P>
On January 12, acting on orders of the Interior Minister, gendarmes entered the house of veteran political figure and major opposition leader Abdoulaye Lamana without possession of a warrant. They confiscated two registered hunting rifles. On August 30, ANS agents and gendarmes mounted a search of the residence of another opposition figure, former Minister Saleh Kebzabo, without a warrant and after dark. They abused his pregnant wife when she asked to see a warrant, then confiscated documents, money, and an automobile. Police arrested Kebzabo several days later, but released him after protests by opposition political parties. He filed a civil suit against the officials responsible. <P>
The Government engages in widespread telephone surveillance without judicial authority.<P>
<B>COMOROS:</B> The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and property. There were no known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy or correspondence.<P>
<B>CONGO</B>: The Constitution provides for the privacy of homes as well as correspondence and telecommunications. Official searches of private properties and communications require a warrant, but in practice warrants are not uniformly served. There is a widespread belief that the Government continues to monitor telephones.<P>
<B>COTE D'IVOIRE:</B> The Code of Penal Procedure specifies that a police official or investigative magistrate may conduct searches of homes without a judicial warrant if there is reason to believe that there is evidence on the premises concerning a crime. The official must have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any evidence seized in the search and is required to have witnesses to the search, which may not take place between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. In practice, police sometimes use a general search warrant without a name or address. On occasion, police have entered homes of non-Ivorian Africans (or apprehended them at large), taken them to local police stations, and extorted small amounts of money for alleged minor offenses. <P>
Security forces have reportedly monitored some private telephone conversations, but the extent of the practice is unknown. There is no evidence that private written correspondence is monitored by authorities. <P>
Citizens are free to join, or not join, any political party.<P>
<B>DJIBOUTI:</B> The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the family, home, correspondence, and communications. The law also requires that the authorities obtain a warrant before conducting searches on private property. However, in practice the Government does not always obtain warrants before conducting such searches, and it monitors the communications of some regime opponents (see Section 1.d.).<P>
In October several persons were slightly injured when national police and army troops forcibly drove out several hundred squatters from an area in Balbala.<P>
<B>EQUATORIAL GUINEA:</B> The Government does not enforce the law requiring judicial warrants for searches, and security forces arbitrarily search homes. <P>
The Government does not overtly force officials to join the PDGE, but for lawyers, government employees, and others, party membership is necessary for employment and promotion. The party banner is prominently displayed with the national flag in government offices, and many officials wear PDGE lapel pins. Foreign firms are often pressured to hire party members. <P>
There is reportedly some surveillance of members of the opposition parties, but there does not appear to be systematic interference with correspondence.<P>
<B>ERITREA:</B> Under the law, warrants are required before the Government can monitor mail, telephones, or other means of private communication. Warrants also are required in routine searches and seizures, except in cases where authorities believe individuals may attempt to escape or destroy evidence. There is no indication that the Government monitored private mail or telephone lines.<P>
<B>ETHIOPIA:</B> The law requires judicial search warrants, but in practice they are seldom obtained outside of Addis Ababa. The Government continued a nationwide campaign to uncover and confiscate unregistered firearms. Government security officials conducted warrantless searches of private and commercial vehicles as well as private homes. Some leaders and supporters of opposition groups allege that they are under surveillance for expressing antigovernment views. For example, AAPO supporters in the Debre Berhan area complain of being watched and occasionally brought into neighborhood government offices for questioning about their activities.<P>
<B>GABON:</B> The Constitution provides for protection from surveillance, from searches without warrant, and from interference with private telecommunications or correspondence. As part of criminal investigations, police may request search warrants from judges, which they obtain easily, sometimes after the fact. The Government has used them in the past to gain access to the homes of opposition figures and their families. Government authorities also routinely monitor private telephone conversations, personal mail, and the movements of citizens.<P>
<B>GAMBIA:</B> Existing constitutional safeguards against arbitrary search and seizure were abrogated as part of Decree 45. AFPRC priorities in security matters and corruption investigations override all constitutional safeguards. Police seized private documents and property without due process and placed armed guards at homes and other properties suspected of having been acquired with embezzled or misappropriated funds. The AFPRC froze accounts of people under suspicion and prohibited by decree the transfer of their property. It denied persons under house arrest access to international telephone service. Security officials are believed to monitor and record telephone communications.<P>
Because of the ban on political parties and activity, membership in political organizations is forbidden.<P>
<B>GHANA:</B> Observers assume that the Government continues to engage in surveillance of citizens engaged in activity which it deems objectionable. In the past, this included monitoring of telephones and mail. <P>
Although the law requires judicial search warrants, police do not always obtain them. The Constitution provides that a person shall be free from interference within the privacy of his home, property, correspondence, or communication. This article has yet to be tested.<P>
<B>GUINEA:</B> The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and judicial search warrants are required by law. However, police frequently ignore these procedures. Police and paramilitary police often ignore legal procedures in the pursuit of criminals and frequently detain private citizens at night roadblocks in order to extort money to supplement their incomes. It is widely believed that security officials monitor mail and telephone calls. Local businesses, especially expatriate companies, often complain of intimidation and harassment by public officials and authorities.<P>
<B>GUINEA-BISSAU:</B> The Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, person, and correspondence, but the Government does not always respect these rights. The authorities examine international and domestic mail, the security forces seldom use judicial warrants, and the police sometimes force entry into private homes.<P>
<B>KENYA: </B>The Constitution permits searches without warrants in certain instances "to promote the public benefit." The Police Act clarifies that policemen may enter a home forcibly if the time required to obtain a search warrant would "prejudice" their investigations. Although security officers generally obtain search warrants, they occasionally conduct searches without warrants to apprehend suspected criminals or to seize property believed to be stolen. The courts have admitted evidence obtained without search warrants to support convictions. <P>
There were several instances during the year where police conducted searches or seizures without warrants. While apprehending members of Mwangaza Trust in early April for holding an allegedly illegal meeting, police searched the Trust offices without a warrant and confiscated several documents. In late April, roughly 20 armed police officers twice searched the residence of opposition M.P. Njehu Gatabaki without a warrant (see Section 1.a.). In May Nakuru police seized letters written by Koigi Wa Wamwere from the car of his defense attorney, opposition M.P. Paul Muite. <P>
Security forces continued to employ various means of surveillance, including a network of informants to monitor the activities of opposition politicians and human rights advocates. A prominent local attorney stated that she had been followed by police in February after representing suspected members of the February Eighteenth Movement. Prior to the raid on the Mwangaza offices, police had trailed several Trust members. In May police followed opposition M.P.'s to a private dinner hosted by fellow M.P. Joab Omino and then dispersed the group for having allegedly convened an illegal meeting. <P>
Although Kenyans are free to choose their political affiliation, the Government continued to discourage civil servants from membership in opposition parties. An Assistant Minister in the Office of the President blamed opposition members in the civil service several times for the country's economic development problems. In April the Public Service Commission gave early retirement to civil servant James Njeru after the Kajiado District Commissioner accused him of supporting the Democratic Party.<P>
<B>LESOTHO: </B>Although search warrants are usually required under normal circumstances, the ISA provides police with wide powers to stop and search persons and vehicles and to enter homes and other places for similar purposes without a warrant. The security services are believed to monitor routinely telephone conversations of Basotho and foreigners on national security grounds.<P>
<B>LIBERIA:</B> While the Constitution provides for these rights, in wartime Liberia LNTG-I and LNTG-II authorities sometimes ignored them. The Constitution provides that police must obtain a warrant or have a reasonable belief that a crime is in progress or is about to be committed before entering a private dwelling. In practice, the police forced entry without a warrant to carry out arrests and investigations. Members of the NSA harassed the director of a well-known human rights organization in July. The director's nephew was detained by police, NSA agents and ECOMOG soldiers July 28 and beaten when he denied knowledge of the director's whereabouts. <P>
The warring factions committed the most egregious abuses, including confiscation, indiscriminate looting, pillaging, and destruction of property. Combatants looted villages, with ULIMO-Krahn and ULIMO-Mandingo factions in Bomi and Cape Mount counties and LPC and NPFL fighters in Southeast counties and elsewhere drawing public outrage. These forces pilfered virtually any item of value and regularly demanded scarce food and personal valuables from already impoverished residents or displaced persons, often robbing them of their clothes and physically abusing them, particularly at checkpoints. Confiscation of private homes and vehicles was common practice.<P>
<B>MADAGASCAR:</B> The home is inviolable by tradition and law, and the State does not intervene in the private lives of the people. The law requires judicially issued warrants to search houses, but there were reportedly some instances of search without proper warrants. One newsmagazine reported that the Government had increased the monitoring of mail and correspondence.<P>
<B>MALAWI</B>: Government authorities generally respected the constitutional right to privacy regarding person, family, home, and private communications. However, army and police forces, in carrying out sweeps for illegal weapons, did not obtain search warrants as required by law. Postal authorities apparently ceased their past practice of opening and inspecting private correspondence.<P>
<B>MALI:</B> The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and the Government respects this right in practice. Police searches are infrequent and require judicial warrants. Security forces do, however, maintain physical and technical surveillance of individuals and groups believed to be threats to internal security, including surveillance of telephone and written correspondence of individuals deemed a threat to national security.<P>
<B>MAURITANIA:</B> The law requires judicial warrants in order to execute home searches, but the authorities often ignore this requirement. During the detention of opposition politicians following the January bread riots, authorities searched some opposition parties' offices without warrants. During the anti-Baathist crackdown, authorities conducted searches without warrants of offices of the Baathist Party and of a party member. <P>
Government surveillance of dissidents and the political opposition is believed to continue, although the extent to which the Government used informants is unknown.<P>
<B>MAURITIUS:</B> The sanctity of the home is provided for in law and generally respected in practice. The search of personal property or premises is allowed only under clearly specified conditions by court order or by police action to stop a crime in progress. The Government's intelligence apparatus continued to carry out illegal surveillance of local opposition leaders and other major figures. In April the opposition proposed a bill to establish a code of conduct for the intelligence arm and define the "subversion and national security" clauses under which the Government claims to use the unit. The bill was soundly defeated.<P>
<B>MOZAMBIQUE:</B> The 1990 Constitution provides for the right to privacy and expressly forbids the use of surveillance techniques. By law, police need a warrant to enter homes and businesses. Although there are fewer reports of such activity, incidents of illegal telephone wiretapping by government intelligence agencies allegedly still occur. In July RENAMO's Dhlakama accused the SISE of spying on him during a visit to Gaza Province.<P>
<B>NAMIBIA:</B> The Constitution provides all citizens with the right to privacy and requires arresting officers to secure a judicial warrant for certain listed offenses before conducting a search. The authorities respected these rights in practice.<P>
<B>NIGER:</B> The law requires that police have a search warrant, normally issued by a judge, in order to conduct a search. Police may search without warrants when they have strong suspicion that a house shelters criminals or stolen property. However, human rights organizations report that police often conduct routine searches without warrants.<P>
<B>NIGERIA: </B>Provisions of the 1979 and 1989 constitutions provide for the rights to privacy in the home, in correspondence, and in oral electronic communications. However, the military government regularly interfered in the lives of its citizens, and if the authorities desired to use a warrant in a particular search case, they often secured it from a military tribunal rather than a regular court. Human rights and prodemocracy leaders, including Gani Fawehinmi, Glory Kilanko, and Olisa Agbakoba, reported that security agents regularly followed them and cut off or monitored their organizations' telephones. Credible sources report an increase in harassment and intimidation by police and military units in Ogoniland following the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and the eight other Ogoni activists. Abuses perpetrated in Ogoniland included random search of houses and cars without warrants or probable cause and prevention of any public display of mourning for the Ogoni Nine. <P>
A 1995 money laundering decree allows the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency to monitor telephone communications, access computer systems, and obtain bank and financial records of individual and corporate customers.<P>
<B>RWANDA:</B> The Fundamental Law prohibits such practices. Authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and prosecute violations.<P>
<B>SAO TOME &;PRINCIPE:</B> The Constitution provides for the integrity of the person and the right to privacy of home, correspondence, and private communication. The Government does not engage in intrusive practices, such as surveillance of people or the monitoring of communications. The judicial police are responsible for criminal investigations and must obtain authorization from the Ministry of Justice to conduct searches.<P>
<B>SENEGAL:</B> The Constitution prohibits arbitrary invasion of the home, and there was little government interference in the private lives of citizens, particularly in the rural areas. Under the law, search warrants are required, and only judges may issue them. During high-profile or politically charged investigations police often proceed without the required search warrants.<P>
<B>SEYCHELLES:</B> The Constitution provides for the right to privacy and freedom from arbitrary searches. The law requires a warrant for police searches, and the authorities generally respected this requirement in practice. The law requires that all wiretaps be justified on the grounds of preventing a serious crime and be approved by a judge. There are credible reports the government maintains phone taps on some political personalities.<P>
<B>SIERRA LEONE:</B> Although the Constitution prohibits arbitrary invasion of the home, the authorities still have broad authority under NPRC decrees to monitor actions or conversations within homes, to prevent a person from acting in a manner deemed prejudicial to public safety, to impose restrictions on employment or business, to control association or communication with other persons, and to interfere with correspondence. <P>
In practice, there were numerous occasions of abusive treatment of ordinary citizens by ill-disciplined soldiers and police, both within and outside the war zone. These abuses included forced entry into homes, robberies, and assaults, some of which were fatal. A number of soldiers accused of looting were court-martialed. One lieutenant found guilty of looting was sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment. Sixteen soldiers arrested for an attempted robbery were detained and awaited court-marital at year's end (see Section 1.e.).<P>
<B>SOMALIA:</B> Looting and forced entry into private property continued but at levels reduced from previous years when large urban areas were forcibly occupied by invading militiamen. Such looting occurred in January and May, however, during heavy fighting between militia forces of the Abgal and Murosade subclans in Mogadishu. U.N. properties in Mogadishu were looted in January by the Abgal and in February by both the Habr Gedr and Abgal. A hospital operated by Indian peacekeepers in Baidoa was looted in January, soon after their withdrawal. The premises of a Dutch NGO in Garbahare were forcibly entered on February 25 by nine armed Somalis who shot and seriously wounded one international staff member and stole $16,000. All but one of those responsible were subsequently arrested, and the money was recovered by community leaders. NGO warehouses in Kismayo and Baidoa were also looted during the year. <P>
Most properties that were forcibly occupied during militia campaigns in 1992-1993, notably in Mogadishu and the lower Shabelle, remained in the hands of persons other than their prewar owners.<P>
<B>SOUTH AFRICA:</B> Police and security forces retain the legal authority to engage in domestic surveillance activities. Most observers believe that use of this authority generally has been limited to the pursuit of legitimate law enforcement and national security activities. At year's end, evidence emerged of wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping of senior police officials and a government minister, although the identities and motives of the perpetrators remain unclear. <P>
In July the Government selected judges for the Constitutional Land Court established to adjudicate claims of persons dispossessed and removed from land during the apartheid era. Several thousand land claims have already been lodged with the Commission on Restitution of Land Rights which has been set up to process, investigate, and attempt to settle claims. Decisions will be referred to the court for approval, and complex claims will be heard and decided by the Court. The deadline for lodging claims is May 1997, and the Court must complete its work within 5 years. <P>
Unauthorized land invasions by squatters also continued sporadically throughout the year, a practice severely criticized by the Government as inimical to the housing strategy it devised as part of its Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP).<P>
<B>SUDAN:</B> The Government routinely interferes with its citizens' privacy. Security forces frequently conducted night searches without warrants. They targeted persons suspected of political crimes or, in northern Sudan, of distilling or consuming illegal alcoholic beverages. <P>
A wide network of government informants conducted pervasive surveillance in schools, universities, markets, workplaces, and neighborhoods. The Government disbanded political parties and prevented citizens from forming new political groupings. The authorities kept key opposition figures under frequent surveillance. The Government also continued its practice of summarily dismissing military personnel and other government employees whose loyalty was suspect. Dozens lost their jobs throughout the year. In August the Government set up a committee to review the cases of persons who had been summarily dismissed since the 1989 coup. However, the review eligibility criteria were such that only 20 percent of the cases of those summarily dismissed were eligible. At year's end, little progress had been made in the review process. <P>
Security personnel routinely opened and read mail and monitored telephones. During the first half of the year, the Government enforced a ban on unlicensed satellite dishes, but enforcement tapered off later in the year. On July 16, Ahmed Abdalla Akood, a former government official, was detained and interrogated for owning a fax machine. <P>
Government-instituted neighborhood "popular committees"-- ostensibly a mechanism for political mobilization--served as a means for monitoring households. These committees caused many citizens to be wary of neighbors who could report them for "suspicious" activities, including "excessive" contact with foreigners. The committees also furnished or withheld documents essential for obtaining an exit visa from Sudan. In high schools, students were sometimes pressured to join pro-regime youth groups. <P>
A Muslim man can marry a non-Muslim, but a Muslim woman cannot marry a non-Muslim, unless he converts to Islam. Only Muslims are allowed to adopt children (see Section 2.c.). <P>
In March the home of the family of Umma Party Secretary General Omar Nur El Dayem was confiscated without prior notice; the eviction may have been due, in part, to Nur El Dayem's testimony before the U.S. Congress.<P>
<B>SWAZILAND:</B> The law requires a warrant from a magistrate before police may search homes or other premises, and police generally respect this requirement in practice. However, police officers with the rank of subinspector or higher have the right to search without a warrant if they believe evidence might be lost through delay in obtaining a warrant. While searches without warrants occur occasionally, the issue of legality of evidence rarely arises in court.<P>
There is no evidence that the Government systematically monitors private correspondence or conversations.<P>
<B>TANZANIA: </B>The State continued to interfere with these rights, which are generally provided for in the Constitution. The CCM has historically penetrated all levels of society through local cells, varying in size from single family homes to large apartment buildings and containing from 10 to 200 persons. Unpaid party officials serve as 10-cell leaders with authority to resolve problems at the grassroots level and to report to authorities any suspicious behavior, event, or noncompliance with compulsory night patrol service in the neighborhood. In 1993, elections were held for new grassroots leaders to replace the CCM 10-cell leaders in nonparty business. In fact, few voters participated in these elections which were boycotted by the opposition, and the 10-cell leaders retained nearly all of their power and influence. <P>
CCM membership is voluntary and is estimated at 2 to 3 million card holders. While in the past, CCM membership had been necessary for advancement in political and other areas, the importance of such membership is waning. <P>
The Criminal Procedures Act of 1985 authorizes police officials (including the civilian anticrime units) to issue search warrants; however, the act also authorizes searches of persons and premises without a warrant if necessary to prevent the loss or destruction of evidence connected with an offense or if circumstances are serious and urgent. In practice, warrants are rarely requested, and police and other security services search private homes and business establishments at will. The security services reportedly monitor telephones and correspondence of some citizens and selected foreign residents. <P>
Compulsory participation in local anticrime groups known as Sungusungu continued in some areas and waned in others.<P>
<B>TOGO:</B> In criminal cases, a judge or senior police official may authorize searches of private residences. In political and national security cases, the security forces need no prior authorization. Police conducted searches without warrants, searching for dissidents' arms caches as well as for criminals. The Government monitors telephones and correspondence, and maintains the police and gendarmerie as domestic intelligence services.<P>
<B>UGANDA: </B>The Government does not generally intrude in the privacy, family, or home of citizens. Prison officials routinely censor the mail of prisoners. The law requires that the police have search warrants before entering private homes or offices, and the police generally observed this law in practice. However, the police sometimes improperly searched homes and vehicles without prior warrants.<P>
<B>ZAIRE:</B> Security forces routinely ignore the Transitional Act's provision for the inviolability of the home and of private correspondence. They ignore the requirement for a search warrant, entering and searching homes at will. In March gendarmes in Lilangi perpetrated a villagewide house-by-house pillage while detaining homeowners in the local prison. In April approximately 60 Civil Guards besieged the home of the suspended head of the national customs office in Kinshasa where they stole money and personal belongings. Security forces looted Antoine Gizenga's home following PALU's July 29 demonstration (see Section 1.a.). <P>
The threat of rape, sometimes perpetrated by uniformed persons, restricts the freedom of movement at night for women in some neighborhoods. Groups of citizens have implemented neighborhood watch programs, but women in many parts of Kinshasa do not leave their homes at night. <P>
The DSP has also been used to intimidate private businesses for the commercial gain of individuals. For example, the DSP intervened in a private commercial dispute between a foreign-owned company and a local competitor firm owned by one of Mobutu's closest associates. The Kengo Government strongly supports the contractual rights of foreign investors and has sought, unsuccessfully in most cases, to curtail arbitrary interference by elements of the military, as in this case. Uniformed personnel routinely interfere with daily economic activities, especially those that take place outside formal channels. Currency vendors are particularly at risk and remain subject to repeated robberies by uniformed assailants. In June soldiers in Kinshasa looted a makeshift market before burning it down and chasing sellers from the area. <P>
Citizens are free to join or refrain from participating in any political party. However, opposition party members often complain that they are followed or harassed by troops loyal to the President. Citizens widely assume that the Government monitors mail and telephone communications.<P>
<B>ZAMBIA: </B>The Constitution provides for respect for privacy and the inviolability of the home, and the authorities generally respected these rights in practice.<P>
Except during a state of emergency, the law requires a warrant before police may enter a home. Roundups of suspected illegal aliens in the home or workplace continued. According to the government Commissioner for Refugees, immigration officials are empowered under the law to conduct these roundups without a warrant.<P>
<B>ZIMBABWE:</B> The Constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence. Although the Government authorities generally respect these prohibitions and violations are subject to legal sanction, it is widely known that the Government sometimes monitors private correspondence and telephones, particularly international communications. <P>
The need for land reform in Zimbabwe is almost universally accepted; however, problems have arisen with implementation of the 1992 Land Acquisition Act. Farmers whose lands have been designated for acquisition may only appeal the amount of compensation in administrative courts, not the initial decision to acquire their farms. Although there were no new designations in 1995, in the past this act was implemented largely along racial lines; the Government stated that black-owned commercial farms would not be subject to designation. In a few cases, land was designated for acquisition to achieve political goals. Opposition party leader M.P. Ndabaningi Sithole continued to fight the Government over its 1993 acquisition of his farm.<P>
<BR>
<H2><B>LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN</B></H2>
<B>ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA:</B> The Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>ARGENTINA:</B> The Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to legal sanction, although in practice, local police have the right to stop and search individuals without probable cause. <P>
<B>BAHAMAS:</B> The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure and the Government generally respects these prohibitions in practice. The law usually requires a court order for entry into or search of a private residence, but a police inspector or more senior police official may authorize a search without a court order where probable cause of a weapons violation exists. Such an official may also authorize the search of a person (which extends to the vehicle in which the person is traveling) without a court order should probable cause of drug possession exist. The Government neither censors mail nor restricts receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.<P>
<B>BARBADOS: </B>The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires warrants to be issued before privately owned property may be entered and searched.<P>
The Government does not routinely interfere in the private lives of its citizens. Nonetheless, there continued to be credible reports that, in response to increased drug-related crime, the police resorted to searches of homes in certain neighborhoods, sometimes without warrants. The Government neither censors mail nor restricts the receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.<P>
<B>BELIZE: </B>The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.<P>
<B>BOLIVIA:</B> The Constitution provides for the sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens, and government authorities generally respect these provisions. There were credible allegations of UMOPAR abuses involving illegal searches and thefts of property from homes. However, residents in the coca growing areas generally are reluctant to file and pursue formal complaints, and there were no known prosecutions of UMOPAR officials. In August the Government and coca growers union representatives agreed to form a mixed commission with offices throughout the Chapare coca-growing region, where most offenses allegedly occur. These offices would accept and pursue complaints of human rights abuses committed by anyone, including police, narcotics traffickers, or coca growers. The first such office began to function in Chimore in December.<P>
The Government respects the rights of individuals to determine family size, religion, and political affiliations.<P>
<B>BRAZIL:</B> The Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion into the home, although wiretaps authorized by judicial authority are permitted. There were no reports of illegal entry for political reasons, but illegal entry into homes without a warrant occurs in searches for criminal suspects. Those conducting military searches during Operation Rio were accompanied by a policeman with arrest authority, along with a search warrant. According to the Brazilian Bar Association, search teams obtained generic search warrants, which were used to enter houses at will. The inviolability of private correspondence is respected. <P>
Wiretaps are unconstitutional except when authorized by a judicial authority for purposes of criminal investigation and prosecution, and provided implementing legislation exists regulating the conditions under which wiretaps may be used. Wiretapping was a common police practice until an incident targeting a presidential aide led Justice Minister Jobim to forbid further wiretapping until passage of the constitutionally required implementing legislation, which was awaiting Congressional approval at the end of 1995.<P>
<B>CHILE:</B> The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions. A new privacy law, promulgated on November 20, bars obtaining and dissemination of information by undisclosed taping, telephone intercepts, and other surreptitious means.<P>
<B>COLOMBIA:</B> The law generally requires a judicial order for authorities to enter a private home, except in cases of hot pursuit. In remote regions, the military forces have civilian prosecutorial units delegated to them. Human rights groups charged that these delegated units were unconstitutional, and Congress refused to grant them permanent status. Nonetheless, there were credible reports that they continued to function, often facilitating army searches without bothering to apply for search warrants from the courts. To address this problem, the Ministry of Defense increased training in legal search procedures that comply with constitutional and human rights. <P>
A prosecutor must authorize telephone monitoring and the interception of mail. This protection extends to prisoners held in jails. However, various state authorities tap phones without obtaining authorization.<P>
<B>COSTA RICA: </B>The Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction. The law requires judicial warrants to search private homes. Judges may approve use of wiretaps in limited circumstances, primarily to combat narcotics trafficking.<P>
<B>CUBA:</B> Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of one's home and correspondence, official surveillance of private and family affairs by government-controlled mass organizations, such as the CDR's, remains one of the most pervasive and repressive features of Cuban life. The State has assumed the right to interfere in the lives of citizens, even those who do not actively oppose the Government and its practices. The Communist Party controls the mass organizations which permeate society. Their ostensible purpose is to "improve" the citizenry, but in fact their goal is to discover and discourage nonconformity. Citizen participation in these mass organizations has declined; the economic crisis has both reduced the Government's ability to provide material incentives for their participation and forced many people to engage in black market activities which the mass organizations are supposed to report to the authorities. <P>
The authorities utilize a wide range of social controls. The Interior Ministry employs an intricate system of informants and block committees (the CDR's) to monitor and control public opinion. While to a lesser extent than in the past, CDR's continue to report on suspicious activity, including conspicuous consumption; unauthorized meetings, including those with foreigners; and defiant attitudes toward the Government and the revolution. <P>
State security often reads international correspondence and monitors overseas telephone calls and conversations with foreigners. Citizens do not have the right to receive publications from abroad. Security agents subject dissidents, foreign diplomats, and journalists to surveillance. <P>
State security officials threatened human rights advocate Victoria Ruiz Labrit with having her children removed from her custody if she continued her involvement in the human rights movement. <P>
The authorities regularly search people and their homes, without probable cause, to intimidate and harass them. In July police searched the homes of independent journalists Nestor Baguer and Jose Rivero Garcia and seized their facsimile machines (see Section 2.a.). In August state security agents seized the replacement facsimile machine that Baguer had received. On October 18, state security agents in Camaguey spent 2 1/2 hours searching the home of Dulce Maria Suarez Ramirez, who provides temporary lodging for the visiting relatives of political prisoners detained in Camaguey province. State security agents seized letters from those families, as well as personal video cassettes and various foreign publications. <P>
The authorities regularly detained human rights advocates after they visited the U.S. Interests Section, confiscated their written reports of human rights abuses, and seized copies of U.S. newspapers and other informational materials.<P>
<B>DOMINICA:</B> The Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC:</B> Apart from occasional exceptions, the Government does not arbitrarily interfere with the private lives of persons or families and generally observes constitutional provisions against invasion of the home. The authorities may only search a residence in the presence of a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor, or in cases of "hot pursuit" and instances where there is reason to believe that a crime is in progress.<P>
<B>ECUADOR:</B> The law prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are the subject of effective legal sanctions.<P>
<B>EL SALVADOR:</B> According to the Constitution, the police must have the resident's consent, a warrant, or a reasonable belief that a crime is being or is about to be committed, before entering a private dwelling. Government authorities generally respected these rights. Wiretapping of telephone communications by the Government, private persons, and political parties is illegal but occurs.<P>
<B>GRENADA:</B> The Constitution provides for protection from these abuses, and there were no reports of such actions. The law generally requires judicially issued warrants for searching homes, except in cases of hot pursuit. The Firearms Act of 1968 and the Drug Abuse Prevention Act Number 7 of 1992 contain other exceptions which give the police and security units legal authority to search persons and property without warrants in certain circumstances. In practice, police obtain warrants in the majority of cases before conducting any search.<BR>
<B><BR>
GUATEMALA:</B> The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home, correspondence, and private documents, but the authorities regularly disregard these provisions. Elements of the security forces continue to monitor private communications. Ministry of Defense officials admit that the military monitors communications "when necessary." The 1993 postal espionage case involving a Serrano administration presidential security staff member remains in the pretrial investigative stage. Many human rights workers alleged surveillance of their movements and activities. <P>
<B>MINUGUA </B>reports that the military has honored the June 1994 presidential order to suspend all conscription, including forced recruitment. There have been isolated cases of minors enlisting voluntarily, in which the offices of MINUGUA and the PDH have been able to secure the release of the underaged recruits. The commander of military zone 22 was suspended in late August, in part because of charges of forced recruitment. <P>
The Constitution requires that PAC service be voluntary. However, in some regions, army officers, military commissioners, and PAC leaders pressured men to become and remain members or extorted a fee from individuals in exchange for permission to resign. The PDH charged that military commissioners in Hacienda Vieja, Chimaltenango forcibly recruited community residents into PAC's. CERJ reports at least two instances in the combat-ridden Quiche department in which PAC members killed former PAC members or their family members in retaliation for their refusal to continue participation in PAC's. <P>
A minor and two adult PAC members were accused of killing a youth, Pedro Saquic, because of his father's refusal to remain in the PAC. Two of the arrest warrants stemming from the case have been served; a third PAC member remains at large. San Marcos diocese officials reported that military commissioners threatened to fire their workers if they declined further participation in PAC's. There are other credible reports that individuals refusing to serve in PAC's suffered threats and other abuses. <P>
On March 3, a human rights group of El Eden, Quiche, invited the town mayor, the commander of military zone 22, the deputy ombudsman, and MINUGUA, as well as several organizations in the capital city, and local residents, to draw up a document certifying that eight individuals, four of them members of the human rights group, no longer wished to be a part of the PAC. According to the PDH office, the mayor, charged by law to hold the meeting, deliberately avoided calling it and had to be escorted to the session by ombudsman officials. A dozen armed military personnel from the Cari military base, including three officers, were at the meeting table. During the meeting, PAC supporters intimidated and harassed those who wanted to withdraw from the PAC, forcing the unresolved adjournment of the session. At year's end, there had been no reported reprisals against those who declined to patrol in El Eden. <P>
The PDH's office reported that soldiers surveilled Gustavo Adolfo Albizures Pedroza, an investigator for FAMDEGUA (a human rights organization dedicated to issues regarding individuals who disappeared and their families), when he was researching names of disappeared persons in old newspapers at the National Periodical Archive. The Defense Ministry has admitted that soldiers were present at the library when Albizures was carrying out his research but denies that they were surveilling him, even though pictures were taken of this surveillance.<P>
<B>GUYANA:</B> The Government generally respects the right to privacy. The laws requiring judicially issued warrants for searches were generally respected.<P>
<B>HAITI:</B> The Constitution prohibits such practices, and government authorities generally respected these prohibitions. In November, however, the Government ordered the police to carry out a number of warrantless searches of private residences as part of an effort to search for weapons. Most of these searches took place in middle-class and wealthy neighborhoods and more frequently in the cities than in rural areas.<P>
<B>HONDURAS: </B>The Constitution specifies that a person's home is inviolable and that persons authorized by the State may enter only with the owner's consent or with the authorization of a competent authority. Entry may take place only between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. or at any time in the event of an emergency or to prevent the commission of crime. However, as in previous years, there were credible charges that police and armed forces personnel failed at times to obtain the needed authorization before entering a private home. Despite the new system of "duty judges" and "duty prosecutors" to issue search orders, some judges still lack the discipline to make themselves available 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. Coordination among the police, the court, and the Public Ministry continues to improve; however, interagency liaison problems still undermine the effectiveness of the system. <P>
Judges may authorize government monitoring of mail or telephones for specific purposes, such as criminal investigation or national security. However, the armed forces reportedly continued to use its operation of the national telephone company to monitor telephone lines of influential people in government, the military, and the private sector without authorization from the appropriate civilian judicial authority.<P>
<B>JAMAICA: </B>The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private life of the individual. The revised Jamaica Constabulary Force Act continues to give security personnel broad powers of search and seizure similar to those granted by the former Suppression of Crimes Act.<P>
<B>MEXICO: </B>The Constitution provides for the rights to privacy, family, home, and correspondence. The law requires search warrants, but there are credible claims that unlawful searches without warrants are common. There were no known claims of forced political membership. SUTAUR, a transit workers union, made a formal complaint to the CNDH in August that microphones had been illegally placed in the prison cells of some of its members. The CNDH is investigating the complaint.<P>
<B>NICARAGUA:</B> The Constitution provides that all persons have the right to privacy of their family and to the inviolability of their home, correspondence, and communications. It also requires warrants for searches of private homes and excludes from legal proceedings illegally seized letters, documents, and private papers. The Government respects these rights in practice, and there were no credible reports of official interference with the right of privacy.<P>
<B>PANAMA:</B> The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home and communications. The authorities may not examine personal documents, monitor communications, or enter and search private residences except by written order. However, there were credible complaints that the police failed to follow legal requirements for arrest and search warrants and instead conducted indiscriminate searches of entire apartment buildings or housing complexes. Police involvement in crime rings also blurred distinctions between improper searches and attempted theft. <P>
Despite the view of some that the Constitution prohibits all wiretapping, the Government maintains that wiretapping with judicial branch approval is legal. Under the guidelines established by new antinarcotics legislation passed in July 1994, the Public Ministry may engage in undercover operations, including "videotaping and recording of conversations." The Supreme Court will ultimately have to decide whether wiretapping is constitutional and, if so, under what circumstances.<P>
<B>PARAGUAY: </B>While the Government and its security forces generally did not interfere in the private lives of citizens, there were exceptions. The Constitution provides that police may not enter private homes except to prevent a crime in progress or when the police possess a judicial warrant. There were allegations that the Government occasionally spied on individuals and monitored communications for political and security reasons. There were also accusations that some government agencies required or pressured their employees to join the ruling Colorado Party.<P>
<B>PERU: </B>The Constitution requires security forces to have a judicial warrant to enter a private dwelling, but this requirement is suspended in the emergency zones, and security forces in those areas routinely conduct searches without a warrant. There were frequent credible reports of illegal telephone monitoring. <P>
A number of rural communities--with arms, training, and encouragement from the army--have organized self-defense forces, or rondas, to protect themselves against terrorist and bandit incursions. These have had a noticeable impact on curbing Sendero's activity in certain areas of the country. In some parts of Peru, rondas have existed for centuries as a form of social organization to protect communities from invaders and rustlers. However, military authorities organized many of the newer rondas and sometimes coerced peasants into participating. <P>
As a regular practice and to a far greater degree, Sendero has forced peasants to join its military ranks, often for extended periods, and to participate in terrorist attacks and executions.<P>
<B>ST. KITTS/NEVIS: </B>There were no reports of arbitrary government or police interference in the private lives of individuals. The law requires judicially issued warrants to search private homes.<P>
<B>ST. LUCIA: </B>The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.<P>
<B>ST. VINCENT: </B>The Constitution prohibits arbitrary search and seizure or other government intrusions into the private life of individual citizens, and there were no reports of such abuses.<P>
<B>SURINAME: </B>The Constitution provides for the right to privacy. The law requires warrants for searches, which are issued not by judges but by quasi-judicial officers who supervise criminal investigations. The police obtain them in the great majority of investigations. The military command curbed invasions of privacy by the military such as the illegal monitoring of telephone calls, monitoring of the movements of human rights advocates, and threatening government officials, policemen, politicians, human rights workers, and journalists. Although some persons continued these activities on occasion, the military authorities reportedly did not authorize them to do so.<P>
<B>TRINIDAD:</B> The law prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction. Police must obtain search warrants to enter private property.<P>
<B>URUGUAY:</B> The Constitution provides for the right to privacy, and the Government generally respects constitutional provisions and safeguards in practice.<P>
<B>VENEZUELA: </B>Constitutional provisions prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and correspondence. However, for 13 months prior to July 6, the Government had suspended the constitutional guarantee of freedom from search without a warrant. Furthermore, the suspension remained in effect in some border areas. Even after reinstatement of the provision, security forces often conducted searches of homes without warrants, especially during anticrime sweeps in impoverished areas. In recent years, there have been some complaints of telephone surveillance, and human rights monitors accused the security forces of illegal telephone monitoring.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2><B>EAST ASIA AND THE PACIFIC</H2>
AUSTRALIA: </B>The law prohibits such practices. The authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>BRUNEI:</B> Although the law permits government intrusion into the privacy of individual persons, families, or homes, this rarely happens. There are sporadic reports of mail having been opened prior to delivery.<P>
<B>BURMA:</B> The military ruled unchecked by any outside authority, and the State continued to interfere extensively and arbitrarily in the lives of private citizens. Through its extensive intelligence network, the Government closely monitored the travel, whereabouts, and activities of many citizens, particularly those known to be politically active. Security personnel selectively screened private correspondence and telephone calls and conducted warrantless searches of private premises. On occasion the Government attempted to jam foreign radio broadcasts (see Section 2.a.). Government employees were required to obtain advance permission before meeting with foreigners. <P>
The SLORC continued to move people out of cities to peripheral new town settlements, though not on the same scale as in the early 1990's. While facilities in some of these areas have improved over time, residents targeted for displacement continued to be given no option but to move, usually on short notice. The military also continued to relocate forcibly some rural villages, especially in ethnic minority areas. <P>
Those able to remain in established cities and towns were subject to arbitrary seizure of their property. In a number of urban areas, residents were compelled to cede land for road-widening projects decided upon without any public consultation or endorsement. Other long-term city residents were required to cede land for commercial redevelopment and were compensated at only a fraction of the value of their lost homes. Automobiles and other movable property remained vulnerable to arbitrary seizure. In rural areas, military personnel at times confiscated livestock and food supplies.<P>
<B>CAMBODIA:</B> The Government does not coerce or forbid membership in political organizations. However, membership in the Khmer Rouge, which is conducting an armed insurgency against the Government, is illegal. There were unconfirmed reports that the Government arbitrarily monitored private electronic communication including in the case of Prince Sirividh (see Section 1.d.). According to human rights observers, the police routinely conducted warrantless searches and seizures. Although people are largely free to live where they wish, there were reports that the municipality of Phnom Penh had forcibly removed over 1,000 indigent and homeless persons from Phnom Penh to rural areas in July; many of them subsequently returned to Phnom Penh.<P>
<B>CHINA:</B> Economic liberalization is creating diverse employment opportunities and introducing market forces into the economy, thus loosening governmental monitoring and regulation of personal and family life, particularly in rural areas. In urban areas, however, most people still depend on their government-linked work unit for housing, permission to have a child, approval to apply for a passport, and other aspects of ordinary life. The work unit, along with the neighborhood committee, is charged with monitoring activities and attitudes. <P>
Although the law requires search warrants before security forces can search premises, this provision is often ignored in practice. In addition, both the Public Security Bureau and Procuratorate apparently can issue search warrants on their own authority. The 1982 Constitution states that "freedom and privacy of correspondence of citizens are protected by law." In practice, however, authorities frequently record telephone conversations of foreign visitors, businessmen, diplomats, residents, and journalists as well as Chinese dissidents and activists and others. Authorities also open and censor domestic and international mail. In March Procurator General Zhang Siqing reported to the National People's Congress that in 1994 the Supreme People's Procuratorate investigated 1,772 cases of illegal search or intrusion, and 104 cases of violations of the right of correspondence. Government security organs monitor and sometimes restrict contact between foreigners and citizens, particularly dissidents. Rules implementing the State Security Law define as a violation of the law "activities of individuals outside the country (including non-Chinese citizens resident in China) who disregard dissuasion and meet with personnel in the country who have endangered state security or who are seriously suspected of endangering state security." <P>
The Government permitted increased international correspondence and information access when commercial Internet accounts became available in May. According to press reports, between March and July alone the number of computers associated with the Internet increased from 400 to 6,000, and the number of users rose from 3,000 to 40,000. However, in the beginning of 1996 a moratorium on new Internet accounts and new regulations governing the content of Internet information threatened this rapid growth. Generally, the regulations appear to be designed to impose the same restrictions on the Internet as now limit public discourse in China: computer experts have reported that the authorities appear to be primarily seeking ways to limit explicit antigovernment political activity on the Internet. Chinese Internet technicians have prevented access to information from dissident groups abroad. At present, however, authorities appear to lack the technical expertise and resources to censor effectively information on the Internet. For example, politically controversial homepages remain accessible. New controls on dissemination of economic information also introduced doubts about the Government's commitment to expanding public access to information. The authorities continued to jam selectively Chinese language broadcasts of the Voice of America (VOA). The effectiveness of the jamming varies considerably by region, with audible signals of VOA and other broadcasters reaching most parts of China, including the capital. <P>
The Government continued to implement comprehensive and highly intrusive one-child family planning policies first adopted in the late 1970's. An official announcement in February that the population had reached 1.2 billion, roughly double the population of 40 years ago, suggested that Chinese efforts to control population growth have had mixed results. China's population policy most heavily affects ethnic Han Chinese in urban areas. Urban couples seldom obtain permission to have a second child. Exceptions are allowed for the 70 percent of Han who live in rural areas, and ethnic minorities are subject to less stringent population controls. <P>
Population control policy relies on education, propaganda, and economic incentives, as well as on more coercive measures including psychological pressure and economic penalties. Rewards for couples that adhere to the policy include monthly stipends and preferential medical and educational benefits. Disciplinary measures against those who violate the policy include fines, withholding of social services, demotion, and other administrative punishments, including, in some instances, loss of employment. Fines for giving birth without authorization vary but they can be a formidable disincentive. In Guangzhou, for example, the standard fine is calculated to be 30 to 50 percent of 7 years' income for the average resident. Unpaid fines have sometimes resulted in confiscation or destruction of personal property. Because penalties for excess births can be levied against local officials and the mothers' work units, many individuals are affected, providing multiple sources of pressure. <P>
According to a government white paper released in August, more than 200 million married couples of childbearing age, or about 80 per cent of all couples in that age group, use contraception. The Government does not authorize physical compulsion to submit to abortion or sterilization, but Chinese officials acknowledge that there are instances of forced abortions and sterilizations. Officials maintain that, when discovered, the responsible officials are disciplined and undergo retraining, but they provided no data or examples to verify this assertion. Officials admit, however, that more severe punishment is rare. Individuals can sue officials who have exceeded their authority in implementing family planning policy, but government officials have not provided statistics on or examples of successful suits on these grounds. <P>
Regulations forbid sex-selective abortion, but because of the traditional preference for male children, particularly in rural areas, some families have used ultrasound to identify female fetuses. Use of ultrasound for this purpose is specifically prohibited by the new Maternal and Child Health Care Law, which calls for punishment of medical practitioners violating this provision. In September a court reportedly sentenced a retired Shanghai doctor to 4 years in prison for identifying the sex of fetuses. The press has reported that the national ratio of male to female births is 114 to 100, while the statistical norm is 106 male births to 100 female. This ratio may exclude many female births, especially the second or third in a family, which are unreported so that the parents can keep trying to conceive a boy, but also probably reflects the abuse of sonography and sex-selective abortion. Female infanticide or neglect of baby girls may also be a factor in some areas. <P>
At least five provincial governments have implemented regulations seeking to prevent people with severe mental handicaps from having children. In June the National Maternal and Child Care Law came into effect. This law calls for premarital and prenatal examinations to determine whether couples have acute infectious diseases, certain mental illnesses (not including mental retardation), or are at risk for passing on debilitating genetic diseases. The Ministry of Health, not the State Family Planning Commission, is charged with implementing the new law, which mandates abortion or sterilization in some cases, based on medical advice. The new measure also provides for obtaining a second opinion and states that patients or their guardians must give written consent to procedures.<P>
<B>CHINA (TAIWAN ONLY): </B>The Constitution and sections of the Criminal and Civil Codes contain provisions protecting privacy. A warrant, issued by a prosecutor or a judge, must be obtained before a search, except when "incidental to arrest." Critics, however, claim that the incidental to arrest provision is not only unconstitutional but often interpreted broadly by police to justify searches of locations other than actual arrest sites. Moreover, police continue to search cars routinely at roadblocks. According to the National Police Administration, warrantless searches are allowed only in specialized circumstances, such as to arrest an escapee or if facts indicate a person is in the process of committing a crime. In any such case, the police must file a report with the prosecutor or court within 24 hours. Evidence collected without a warrant is not excluded from introduction during a trial; however, a policeman who carries out an illegal search may be sued for illegal entry and sentenced to up to 1 year's imprisonment. According to Executive Yuan regulations, judicial and security authorities may file a written request to a prosecutor's office to monitor telephone calls to collect evidence against a suspect involved in a major crime.<P>
<B>FIJI: </B>In general, the Government respects the privacy of the home. However, the Intelligence Service has powers, within specific operational guidelines, to search people and property, access private financial records, and monitor mail and telephones when a warrant is issued by the National Security Council. The Intelligence Service does conduct surveillance of persons it believes represent a security threat. Some political dissidents believe their telephones and mail are monitored, but they have not produced substantiating evidence.<P>
<B>HONG KONG - (see UK):</B> The law provides for the right of privacy, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is vested with powers that are normally exercised only by a judicial officer. Amendments to ordinances governing ICAC deprived it of the independent authority to issue arrest or search warrants (it must now go to the courts), but it still operates on the assumption that any excessive, unexplainable assets held by civil servants are considered ill-gotten until proven otherwise.<P>
<B>INDONESIA </B>The Indonesian people continue to lack the ability to change their government. The Government continued to impose severe limitations on freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association. It suppressed efforts to develop a truly free trade union movement, but encouraged some developments that appear to open the door to greater flexibility within the registered trade union federation. Labor organizations trying to compete with the official trade union federation were subject to continuing harassment and intimidation. Elements of the armed forces continued to be responsible for the most serious human rights abuses. Military leaders in some cases showed willingness to admit publicly abuses by military personnel and take action against them, including in a brutal incident in East Timor. Punishment, however, rarely matched the severity of the abuse. The judiciary, while still largely subservient to the executive branch and subject to widespread corruption, made several significant decisions against government interests that suggested somewhat greater judicial independence. <P>
The Government continued to exert strong pressure against antigovernment critics, independent journalists, and labor activists. These constraints, however, did not completely dampen dissenting voices in the public and the media. Many human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) remained active, and the Government tolerated wide press coverage of some sensitive issues. The Government announced a phasing-out of a discriminatory symbol on the identification cards of ex political prisoners and their families, and some easing of restrictions on the right of free assembly both beginning in early 1996. The government-appointed National Human Rights Commission displayed increasing independence, spotlighting abuses and occasionally taking positions at variance with government policies and actions. <P>
On East Timor, no progress was made in accounting for the missing persons following the 1991 Dili incident or the 10 other Timorese that disappeared in 1995. Troop levels remained unjustifiably high. The armed forces used excessive force in making arrests following anti-integration rioting in Dili in October. The Government reimposed restricted access to the province by foreign journalists. <P>
In Irian Jaya, tensions with indigenous inhabitants seeking greater autonomy or independence led to violent repressive measures by military units, resulting in deaths and other human rights abuses documented by several sources, including the National Human Rights Commission, the Catholic Church, and NGO's. Security forces reportedly killed 16 or more civilians throughout Irian Jaya between mid-1994 and mid-1995.<P>
<B>JAPAN:</B> Under the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made upon separate warrant issued by a judge. Standards for issuing such warrants exist to guard against arbitrary searches. There were no reports that the Government or any other organization arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.<P>
<B>KIRIBATI: </B>The law prohibits such practices. Government authorities respect these provisions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.<P>
<B>KOREA, DPR:</B> The constitutional stipulation that "citizens are guaranteed the inviolability of person and residence and the privacy of correspondence" does not reflect reality. The Government relies upon an extensive, multilevel system of informers to identify critics and potential troublemakers. Whole communities are sometimes subjected to massive security checks. According to Kim Jong Il, North Korean society embodies "a new way of thinking" which cannot be evaluated on the basis of "old yardsticks" of human rights imported from abroad. In this context, the DPRK celebrates the closed nature of its society as a virtue. The possession of "reactionary material" and listening to foreign broadcasts are both considered crimes which may subject the transgressor to the death penalty. In some cases, entire families are punished for political offenses allegedly committed by one member of the family. <P>
The Government's ideology is derived from Marxist-Leninist concepts of collective consciousness and the "Juche" idea of self-reliance propounded by Kim Il Sung. Although Juche is generally translated as "self-reliance," it more literally means "the ability to act independently without regard to outside interference." Originally described as "a creative application of Marxism-Leninism" in the Korean context, Juche is a malleable philosophy, reinterpreted from time to time by the regime as its ideological needs change and used by the regime as a "spiritual" underpinning for its rule. <P>
As defined by Kim Il Sung, the Juche idea connotes a quasi-mystical concept in which the collective will of the people is distilled into a supreme leader whose every act is by definition in accordance with the State and society's needs. An October 1995 commentary in the North Korean press explained that "the leader is not an individual, but the brain of the revolution, the center of unity, and the supreme person who represents the popular masses." Opposition to such a leader, or to the rules, regulations, and goals established by his regime, is thus in itself opposition to the national interest. The regime therefore claims a social interest in identifying and isolating such people. <P>
The Government continued to classify citizens into three main classes: "core," "wavering," and "hostile." These 3 classes are further subdivided into over 50 subcategories based on perceived loyalty to the party and the leadership. Security ratings are assigned to each individual; according to some estimates, as much as 75 percent of the population is designated as either wavering or hostile. These loyalty ratings determine access to employment, higher education, place of residence, medical facilities, and certain stores, and affect the severity of punishment in the case of legal infractions. While there are signs that the Government has eased enforcement of this rigid system in recent years, it remains a basic feature of North Korean society.<P>
The authorities subject citizens in all age groups and occupations to intensive political and ideological indoctrination. Even after Kim Il Sung's death, his cult of personality and glorification of his family and the official Juche ideology continued to be omnipresent. The North Korean press regularly reports the occurrence of miracles on the anniversary of Kim Il Sung's birth. The cult approaches the level of a state religion. <P>
The goal of indoctrination remains to ensure loyalty to the Kim Il Sung system and to his son and heir Kim Jong Il, as well as conformity to the State's ideology and authority. The necessity for intensification of such indoctrination is repeatedly stressed in the writings of Kim Jong Il, who attributes the collapse of the Soviet Union largely to insufficient ideological indoctrination, compounded by the entry of foreign influences. <P>
Indoctrination is carried out systematically not only through the mass media, but also in schools and through worker and neighborhood associations. Kim Jong Il has recently stated that ideological education must take precedence over academic education in the nation's schools, and has also called for the intensification of mandatory ideological study and discussion sessions for adult workers. One objective of these extended studies is to deny citizens sufficient leisure time in which to engage in undesirable activities or reflection. <P>
Another aspect of the State's indoctrination system is the use of mass marches, rallies, and staged performances, sometimes involving hundreds of thousands of people. The recent celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Korean Workers' Party included several hours of carefully choreographed demonstrations of mass adulation of the leadership, reportedly involving virtually the entire population of Pyongyang and outlying communities. Foreign visitors were told that nonparticipation by Pyongyang residents in this event was unthinkable. <P>
Citizens with relatives who fled to South Korea at the time of the Korean War appear to be classified as part of the hostile class in the DPRK's elaborate loyalty system. This subcategory alone encompasses a significant percentage of the North Korean population. One defector estimated that the class of those considered potentially hostile may comprise 25 to 30 percent of the population; others place the figure at closer to 20 percent. Members of this class are subject to discrimination, although a defector has claimed that their treatment has improved greatly in recent years. <P>
The Government monitors correspondence and telephones. Telephones are restricted to domestic operation <P>
<B>KOREA, REPUBLIC OF:</B> In general the Government honors the integrity of the home and family. In the past, the security services conducted varying degrees of surveillance, including telephone monitoring, of political dissidents. The Antiwiretap Law and the law to reform the NSP were designed to curb government surveillance of civilians, and appear largely to have succeeded. The Antiwiretap Law lays out broad conditions under which the monitoring of telephone calls, mail, and other forms of communication are legal. It requires government officials to secure a judge's permission before placing wiretaps, or, in the event of an emergency, soon after placing them, and it provides for jail terms for those who violate this law. Some human rights groups argue that a considerable amount of illegal wiretapping is still taking place, and assert that the lack of an independent body to investigate whether police have employed illegal wiretaps hinders the effectiveness of the Antiwiretap Law. <P>
Citizens are not allowed to listen to radio broadcasts from North Korea in their homes or read books published in North Korea if the Government determines that they are doing so for the purpose of helping North Korea. Student groups make plausible claims that government informants are posted around university campuses. Persons with backgrounds as political or labor activists may find it difficult to obtain some forms of employment or advance in such fields as government, broadcast media, and education.<P>
<B>LAOS:</B> Concomitant with economic liberalization, the Government relaxed some elements of state control, including its rigorous police monitoring of personal and business activities and enforcement of the nighttime curfew. However, while the Constitution prohibits arrests or searches in homes without a warrant or authorization, the security bureaus may authorize search and seizure by themselves rather than by judicial authority. The Government and the party continue to monitor the citizenry sporadically through a system of neighborhood and workplace committees. The neighborhood committees also have responsibility for maintaining public order and reporting "bad elements" to the police. These committees usually concern themselves more with street crime and instances of moral turpitude than with political activism. The degree of surveillance and control varies from province to province, but overall has diminished in recent years. <P>
The Penal Code forbids telephone monitoring without proper authorization, but the security bureaus are believed to authorize such monitoring themselves. The Government continued to monitor international mail and telephone calls, probably including some faxes, although the increasing number of such calls limited the scope of such surveillance. <P>
The 1991 Constitution stipulates that the "national community" owns all land. Private "ownership" is in the form of land use certificates, which can be bought, sold, and transferred to heirs. Many Lao who fled the country after 1975 have regained confiscated property after demonstrating their intent to repatriate. <P>
Contact between ordinary Lao and foreigners has increased in recent years as restrictions, such as the requirement for government approval of invitations to most foreigners' homes, are no longer enforced. The Government has eased the prohibition against foreigners staying with Lao families in urban areas, and allows Lao citizens to marry foreigners but only with prior government approval. Marriages without government approval may be annulled, with the foreign spouse subject to fine or arrest.<P>
<B>MACAU -</B> (see Portugal): Laws provide for the inviolability of the home and of communication, the right of ownership of private property and enterprises, and the freedom to marry and raise a family. There are no indications of abuse of these rights by the Government.<P>
<B>MALAYSIA: </B>The law provides for these rights and the government generally respects them. Provisions in the security legislation (see Section 1.d.), however, allow the police to enter and search without a warrant the homes of persons suspected of threatening national security. Police may also confiscate evidence under these acts. In some cases each year, police have used this legal authority to search homes and offices, seize books and papers, monitor conversations, and take people into custody without a warrant.<P>
<B>MARSHALL ISLANDS: </B>The Constitution provides for freedom from such practices, government authorities respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>MICRONESIA:</B> The law prohibits such arbitrary interference, and in practice there is none.<P>
<B>MONGOLIA:</B> The Constitution provides that the State shall not interfere with the private beliefs and actions of citizens, and the Government generally respects this in practice. The head of the MCIA may, with the knowledge and consent of the Prime Minister, direct the monitoring and recording of telephone conversations. The extent of such monitoring is unknown.<P>
During a 5-month long teachers' strike a listening device was found in a police jacket which had been left at the headquarters of the temporary strike committee. Both the police and the MCIA denied knowledge of, and responsibility for, the device's placement, but many of those involved in the job action viewed the incident as a government attempt to harass and intimidate the strikers. In the late autumn, an SGH investigatory committee made the judgment that responsibility for the placement of the device did rest with the police, and it called for the resignation of the head of police.<P>
<B>NAURU:</B> The Constitution generally prohibits these abuses. Searches not sanctioned by court order are prohibited, and there is no surveillance of individuals or of private communications. Citizenship and inheritance rights are traced through the female line. Until very recently, laws restricted intermarriage with non-Nauruans. Although the laws have changed, intermarriage between women and foreign males still draws substantial social censure. The foreign spouses--male or female--of citizens have no automatic right of abode in Nauru. They are, however, normally granted short-term "visits" sponsored by the Nauru spouse, or they may apply for longer term work permits. Foreign spouses are not eligible for citizenship.<P>
<B>NEW ZEALAND:</B> The law prohibits such practices, government authorities respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>PALAU:</B> The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>PAPUA NEW GUINEA:</B> While the authorities generally respect privacy rights, police in the highlands have burned homes to quell intertribal conflict and punish communities suspected of harboring suspected criminals. Some communities have sought redress through the courts. For example, in June the National Court in Mount Hagen awarded $42,000 to villagers for property damage resulting from a July 1993 police raid. Police continued to conduct warrantless searches and seizures.<P>
<B>PHILIPPINES:</B> The Constitution provides that search warrants may be issued by a judge on a finding of probable cause. Restrictions on search and seizure are generally observed, although raids without search warrants on private homes do occur. Judges have thrown out evidence obtained illegally. <P>
The Government does not interfere with the free personal use of the mails or other public communications except upon issuance of a court order in the course of an investigation. <P>
Since 1992 the forced eviction of squatters has been illegal, unless adequate notice and resettlement sites are provided. Human rights NGO's have criticized government efforts to resettle tenant farmers and urban squatters to make way for infrastructure, commercial, and housing developments. The U.N. Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights expressed concern over reports of forced evictions. Government efforts to resettle squatters have been complicated by extensive poverty, the limited availability of affordable housing for the urban poor, and squatter syndicates that exploit human misery and legal safeguards for pecuniary or political ends. In some instances, government authorities have resorted to forced evictions when faced with repeated, organized squatter occupations of previously cleared land. During a November 27 forced eviction near Manila's "Smokey Mountain" (a dump site), police fired on unarmed squatters, killing one protester and wounding scores of others. Land rights issues are made more difficult by the slow process of the Government's exercise of eminent domain and complex zoning regulations.<P>
<B>SINGAPORE: </B>The Government can use its wide discretionary powers under the ISA if it determines that national security is threatened. In most cases, the law requires search warrants, normally issued by the magistrate court, for intrusion into the home. Law enforcement officers may, however, search a person, home, or property without a warrant if they decide that searches are necessary to preserve evidence.<P>
The ClA and the MDA Act also permit warrantless searches in dealing with drug- and secret society related offenses. The courts may undertake judicial review of such searches at the request of the defendant. Divisions of the Government's law enforcement agencies, including the Internal Security Department (ISD) and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Board (CPIB), have wide networks for gathering information. The authorities have the capability to monitor telephone and other private conversations and conduct surveillance. While there were no proven allegations that they did so in 1995, it is widely believed that the authorities routinely conduct surveillance on some social and political critics of the Government and on some opposition politicians.<P>
<B>SOLOMON ISLANDS: </B>In addition to legal provisions, the traditional culture provides strong protection against these types of abuses. A constitutionally provided Ombudsman, with the power of subpoena, can investigate complaints of official abuse, mistreatment, or unfair treatment. While the office has potentially far-ranging powers, it focuses mainly on intervening on behalf of individuals when official administrative errors are brought to the office's attention.<P>
<B>THAILAND: </B>The law requires police to obtain a warrant prior to a search. Warrants are issued by the police with prior Ministry of Interior or provincial governor approval and are not subject to judicial review. There were some credible reports that officers sometimes endorse warrants in advance and then allow their noncommissioned subordinates to apply them as needed. The Anti-Communist Activities Act allows officials engaged in "Communist suppression operations" to conduct searches without warrants, but these powers rarely have been invoked in recent years and were not invoked in 1995. <P>
Thai society is essentially open; membership in political organizations is voluntary, and the unmonitored exchange of ideas is generally permitted. However, security services monitor persons espousing leftist or controversial views, including foreign visitors.<P>
<B>TONGA: </B>By law and in practice, no one may enter or search the home of another or remove any item of property unless in possession of a warrant issued by a magistrate. Neither the State nor political organizations intrude arbitrarily into a person's private life.<P>
<B>TUVALU:</B> The Government adheres in practice to the legal protection of privacy of the home. It does not arbitrarily intrude into the private life of the individual.<P>
<B>VANUATU: </B>There were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.<P>
<B>VIETNAM: </B>The Government continued to operate a nationwide system of surveillance and control through household registration and block wardens who use informants to keep track of individual activities. However, many foreign observers believe this monitoring was done with less vigor and efficiency than in the past as authorities focused on those suspected of involvement in unauthorized political or religious activities. Anecdotal evidence suggests government monitoring is stricter in the south, especially Ho Chi Minh City. In urban areas, most citizens were free to maintain contact and work with foreigners, although many remained nervous about extensive social contacts. <P>
The Government continued to censor mail, confiscate packages, and monitor telephone, electronic mail, and fax transmissions. In the past, the party pressed people to belong to one or more mass organizations, which exist for villages, city districts, schools, workers (trade unions), youth, and women. However, with the growth of the private sector, those organizations play a less important societal role. While membership in the VCP remains an aid to advancement in the Government or in state companies and is vital for promotion to senior levels of the Government, the party faced increased difficulty attracting new members. <P>
The Government continued to implement a family planning policy that urges all families to have no more than two children. In principle, the Government can deny promotions and salary increases to government and party employees with more than two children. In practice, the penalty is not applied to employees in good standing. For others, there are no penalties for those with more than two children, but local regulations permit fines based on the cost of extra social services incurred by the extra child, or reductions in state subsidies for those services. These penalties are not uniformly or universally applied.<P>
WESTERN SAMOA: The law provides for protection from invasion of the home or seizure of property without substantive and procedural safeguards, including search warrants, which are issued by the judicial branch. Practically, however, there is little or no privacy in the village. Village officials by law must have permission to enter homes, but there can be substantial social pressure to grant such permission.<P>

<H2><B>EUROPE AND CANADA</B></H2>
<B>ALBANIA:</B> The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the inviolability of dwellings and the individual person, as well as the privacy of correspondence. There have been credible, widespread allegations by individuals and opposition parties of government-sanctioned tampering with correspondence and wiretapping. <P>
The Government has considered plans to open the files of the Sigurimi (the former secret police of the Communist regime), and Parliament passed a law permitting the files to be made available to a governmental commission charged with investigating future candidates for elective and appointive office under the lustration law. Senior government officials have indicated that not all the files are intact, and some may have been tampered with in the final days of the Communist regime and during the chain of custody since then. The AHC is concerned that information from the files may have been used for political purposes and protested the lack of legislation on their disposition. <P>
<B>ANDORRA:</B> The Constitution provides citizens with safeguards against arbitrary interference with their "privacy, honor and reputation," and government authorities generally respect these prohibitions. Private dwellings are considered inviolable. No searches of private premises may be conducted without a judicially issued warrant. Private communications also are protected by law.<P>
<B>ARMENIA:</B> The Constitution provides for the right to privacy for citizens, their residences, their communications, and their correspondence. Procedurally, the security ministries must petition the prosecutor's office for permission to tap a telephone or intercept correspondence. The prosecutor's office purportedly must find a compelling need for the wiretap before it will grant the agency permission to proceed. <P>
There were many violations of the right to privacy during waves of army conscription in 1995. Military recruiters appeared at houses where draft-age men were reported to live, and either threatened the occupants or inflicted material damage. Recruiters seized draft-age men in public at markets and on the subway. There are credible reports that Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh officials forcibly conscripted refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. The draft board also sent recruiters to Krasnodar Kray in Russia to retrieve draft-age males who had fled the country. <P>
<B>AUSTRIA:</B> The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction. <P>
<B>AZERBAIJAN: </B>It is widely believed that the Ministry of National Security monitors telephones, especially those of foreigners and prominent political and business figures. The police have periodically raided the offices and homes of opposition press and political parties and their leaders, allegedly searching for illegal weapons or other materials. Usually conducted without any sort of warrant, these investigations often result in the confinement of the person to the Baku city limits or a brief jail sentence for questioning. <P>
During the summer, President Aliyev reportedly issued a decree that all highly placed government officials, as well as regional and municipal government officials and other employees must join his New Azerbaijan Party.<P>
<B>BELARUS:</B> Electronic monitoring of residences and telephones reportedly continues. The KDB, the MVS, and certain border guard detachments have the right to request permission to install wiretaps but must legally obtain a prosecutor's permission before installation. The Government makes no secret of the KDB's activities or capabilities. On August 30 in a televised interview, President Lukashenko boasted of receiving intelligence service reports on opposition member of Parliament Gennady Karpenko's activities. Except in cases of pursuit, a prosecutorial search warrant is needed in order to enter a private home.<P>
<B>BELGIUM: </B>The law prohibits such practices, government authorities respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA: </B>The Republic's Constitution provides for the right to privacy, protection of the family and of children, and property. Governmental respect for these rights was the rule rather than the exception in 1995. Authorities nevertheless monitored communications that impinged on military or other national security concerns. <P>
The persistence of the Serb policy of ethnic cleansing throughout the year in varying degrees constituted sustained arbitrary interference with family and home. In a formal communication to the ICRC on August 14, Bosnian Serb authorities gave assurances that minorities were free to stay or leave territories under their control and that they would not be subject to harassment nor would families be separated in the course of evacuation or men be seized for labor on the front lines. All of these commitments were violated massively and systematically from August through December in the Serb held areas of northern Bosnia. <P>
More than 26,000 Bosniaks and Croats were forced from their homes during this period. A great many of the refugees reported a similar pattern of events. Serb soldiers or police would forcibly enter their homes without notice and threaten the family members with death if they did not leave immediately. Often, no time was allowed for packing and valuables, including property titles, were stolen on the spot. In some cases military-age men would be separated and taken away, members of the family would be beaten, and sometimes killed or raped in the course of the eviction. One 17-year-old Muslim girl from Sanski Most told U.N. officials that she managed to run away with her sisters after her parents had been killed in the course of expelling them from their home on September 21. She was later captured by soldiers of paramilitary leader Zeliko Raznatovic ("Arkan") and raped. <P>
In some cases these atrocities would take place en route to the Bosnian lines. During the week of September 19-26, according to eyewitness reports collected by the U.N., nearly 1,500 Muslim residents of Doboj were forced out of their homes on very short notice, gathered in a sports stadium, and from there bused to an area near the confrontation line and forced to walk some 10 to 15 miles in very difficult conditions. Several elderly people died of exhaustion. Some of the displaced showed clear signs of severe physical abuse. <P>
Families were often told that they could ransom their men for as much as $400 to $500, but even when the money was paid, the men were never released. Many refugees reported that they were harassed in the weeks prior to their expulsions by the paramilitary forces of "Arkan" and Vojislav Seselj, leader of the Radical Party of Serbia. The harassment included threats, beating, murder, rape, and destruction of property. <P>
Local Serbian authorities in Serb-occupied territories continued a policy of summarily confiscating the property of mixed-marriage couples with sons who had either fled abroad or to Federation territory.<P>
<B>BULGARIA:</B> The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, for the right to choose one's place of work and residence, and protects the freedom and confidentiality of correspondence. Human rights observers expressed concerns that illegal wiretaps may still persist but provided no tangible evidence.<P>
<B>CANADA: </B>The law prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>CROATIA: </B>The Constitution declares the home inviolable. Only a court may issue a search warrant, stating the justification for the search of a home or other premises. Police may enter a home without a warrant or the owner's consent only if necessary to enforce an arrest warrant, apprehend a suspect, or prevent serious danger to life or important property. In practice, the authorities often failed to adhere to these constitutional requirements. <P>
International observers witnessed the mass looting, destruction, and burning of property in the reclaimed territories by both official military and civilian personnel and by unhindered civilians allowed to roam the area. Within days of the start of the May and August offensives, the first cases of house burnings were reported. Over one-third of the buildings in the former sectors north and south were burned within 2 months of the August offensive. Another third was heavily damaged and uninhabitable. The village of Donji Lapac and many others with a predominant Serb population were burned to the ground. From early August until the end of the year, international human rights monitors reported daily incidents of looting, burning, and threats made to the remaining local population. Monitors continually reported the names and automobile license numbers of perpetrators to government authorities. Most people detained for looting and arson were released after questioning pending further investigation. Security personnel and military commanders generally did nothing to stop this destruction, and local and international observers often witnessed security forces starting the fires or standing by as they burned. Official investigations and prosecutions for these acts began only after intense international and media pressure on the Government and were viewed as neither serious nor complete. At years end, the Government reported to the U.N. that it had registered 2,878 cases of arson and brought charges against 11 persons. It had identified 1,054 cases of looting, of which 770 had been "clarified," and had charged 1,260 individuals. The Government provided no supporting documentation for these claims. <P>
In August an official decree placed under government administration the abandoned property of citizens who had fled the country for Serbia or other Serb-controlled areas since the 1991 war. The Government claimed that this act was necessary to give Croat refugees decent shelter and to protect the properties from looting and destruction. The decree was viewed internationally as a thinly veiled attempt to prevent the return of Croatian Serbs to their homes. However, it was immediately passed into law by the HDZ-controlled legislature. Owners were allowed a 90-day filing period to reclaim their property, but the new law's complex procedures required a claimant to produce citizenship documents which could not be obtained outside Croatia, and to file a claim in Croatia. Both requirements were practical impediments to Croatian Serbs' efforts to reclaim their property. The time limit for filing a claim was subsequently lifted in January 1996. Although the Government eventually set up processing centers in Belgrade and other nearby capitals, the procedure remained slow. <P>
Military and civil police continued to carry out forced evictions, involving hundreds of families of all nationalities. In other cases, Croatian refugees, often with the appearance of official countenance, forcibly entered the homes of ethnic Serbs and other minorities who had lived for years in family apartments, but who were themselves not listed as the official tenant. Although such evictions were often declared illegal in court, authorities forbade the police to remove the intruders on the basis of a law which requires that a new home be found for a displaced or refugee family before it can be removed from any form of housing, whether it was legally occupying the housing or not. <P>
Forced evictions of ethnic Serbs, Croats, and others from former Yugoslav National Army (JNA) apartments continued. The Ministry of Defense arbitrarily revoked the tenant rights of individuals who had lived in the apartments for decades. Referring to property laws which remove tenancy rights as a result of any 6-month absence, or if the tenant was ruled to have acted against the interests of the Republic of Croatia, the Ministry granted soldiers tenancy of these occupied flats. The soldiers frequently took residences by force of arms, either evicting the current tenants or forcing them to share the quarters. In November the Government passed a law allowing former JNA apartments to be privatized. Unlike other privatizations, legal tenants had restricted rights to purchase their apartments, and the right to purchase was not guaranteed. Family members of the registered tenant were not allowed purchase rights, nor were individuals suspected of armed rebellion or war crimes. Human rights groups plan to sue the Government concerning the constitutionality of this law. <P>
The Constitution provides for the secrecy and safety of personal data, but it was unclear if such guarantees were observed in practice. <P>
Leaders in the Serb-held regions showed no compunction about interfering with the rights of the inhabitants of those areas, particularly non-Serbs. UNCRO continued to provide 24-hour patrols of several minority villages to protect the inhabitants from armed bands. The practice of forcibly moving Serbian refugees or soldiers into the homes of non-Serb residents continued as well.<P>
<B>CYPRUS:</B> Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic law governing the Turkish Cypriot community include provisions protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the authorities. A judicial warrant is required for a police official to enter a private residence.<P>
<B>CZECH REPUBLIC: </B>Electronic surveillance, the tapping of telephones, and interception of mail require a court order. The Government complied with this requirement.<P>
Allegations that the apartment of Green Party leader Jaroslav Vlcek was bugged, made after a meeting there in July between Civic Democratic Alliance President Jan Kalvoda and Social Democratic Party President Milos Zeman, led to an investigation which found no evidence of surveillance. There were no other cases of possible electronic surveillance reported in 1995.<BR>
<B><BR>
DENMARK:</B> The law prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>ESTONIA: </B>The law requires a search warrant for search and seizure of property. During the investigative stage, warrants are issued by the prosecutor upon a showing of probable cause. Once a case has gone to court, warrants are issued by the court. The Constitution provides for secrecy of the mail, telegrams, telephones, and other means of communication. Police must obtain a court order to intercept a person's communications. Illegally obtained evidence is not admissible in court. In October a political scandal erupted when then Minister of Internal Affairs Savisaar was implicated in the illicit recording of his conversations with other politicians. Parliament appointed a special committee to investigate the matter, including the contacts of police with private security firms. Savisaar was dismissed, the cabinet resigned, and a new governing coalition was formed. Security police and parliamentary investigations were continuing at year's end. <P>
There have been no reports of forced political membership, coercive population control, or forced resettlement. In a widely reported case during the summer, the police, without a warrant, destroyed a field of alleged opium poppies. An internal police disciplinary investigation of the incident continued at year's end. At the same time a criminal case was filed against the owner of the field for growing opium poppies; the owner asserted that he was growing oil poppies. The case had not come to trial as of late in the year.<P>
<B>FINLAND:</B> The law prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>FRANCE:</B> The law prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction. <P>
A wiretap of an official who was believed to be involved in a political corruption case was found to be illegal in February by a Paris appeals court.<P>
<B>GEORGIA:</B> Credible reports indicate that both the SGB and MVD monitor private telephone conversations without court order. SGB and MVD officials also enter homes without legal sanction. The frequency and seriousness of such violations, however, are diminishing.<P>
<B>GERMANY: </B>The Basic Law prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>GREECE: </B>Greece in September ratified the European Convention on Protection of an Individual from Use of Personal Information Through Informatics Technology, which prohibits the collection or use of sensitive personal information. The Constitution prohibits invasion of privacy and searches without warrants, and the law permits the monitoring of personal communications only under strict judicial controls. However, the number of persons and groups subjected to government surveillance in recent years raises questions about safeguards. <P>
The security services continued to target human rights activists, non-Orthodox reliogious groups and minority group representatives and to monitor foreign diplomats who met with such individuals. On several occasions, information about such private meetings was given to the press, apparently by government representatives. Human rights activists also reported the continuation of suspicious openings and diversions of mail, some of which was never delivered but was subsequently published in newspapers with apparent links to Greek security services. So far as is known, the Government took no steps to stop such practices or to prosecute those involved. <P>
In June 1994, a parliamentary investigating committee recommended indictment of former Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis and 30 persons from the former Mitsotakis administration on charges of wiretapping political opponents from 1989 to 1991. In January 1995, the Parliament voted to drop all charges against Mitsotakis. Criminal charges against the others were also dropped.<P>
<B>HUNGARY:</B> The law provides that the prosecutor's office may issue search warrants independently. Police must carry out house searches in the presence of two witnesses and must prepare a written inventory of items removed from the premises. Wiretapping, which may be done for national security reasons and for legitimate criminal investigations, requires a court's permission. These provisions appear to be observed in practice.<P>
<B>ICELAND:</B> The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>IRELAND:</B> The Supreme Court has affirmed that, although not specifically provided for in the Constitution, the inviolability of personal privacy, family, and home must be respected in law and practice. This is fully honored by the Government. <P>
The Constitution currently provides that the State shall enact no law permitting divorce, but a referendum to remove this ban passed by a narrow margin on November 24. The High Court is to consider a challenge to the validity of the referendum in 1996. If the results are upheld, the Government plans to introduce legislation in 1996 allowing courts to grant divorces. <P>
Article 40 of the Constitution requires the State to "...respect...defend and vindicate..." the right to life of the unborn, "with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother." But in 1992, following the controversial case of a 14-year-old rape victim who was barred from traveling to the United Kingdom for an abortion, voters approved constitutional amendments specifying that the State, in protecting the unborn, could not limit travel to other countries, or limit access to information relating to services lawfully available in other countries. An abortion information bill implementing the new constitutional provision became law in 1995. The law draws a distinction between "information" and "referral," prohibiting any doctor or agency from making an appointment at a foreign abortion clinic on behalf of a woman. The law also prohibits the provision of abortion information by billboards, public notices, or unsolicited leaflets.<BR>
<B><BR>
ITALY:</B> The law safeguards the privacy of the home, and the authorities respect this provision. Searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out only under judicial warrant and in carefully defined circumstances. There have been no reports of any other kinds of violations of privacy.<P>
<B>KAZAKSTAN: </B>The Constitution guarantees that everyone has the right to "confidentiality of personal deposits and savings, correspondence, telephone conversations, postal, telegraph, and other messages." Limitation of this right is allowed "only in the cases and according to the procedure directly established by law." However, the KNB and Ministry of Internal Affairs, with the concurrence of the procuracy, can and do arbitrarily interfere with privacy, family, home, and correspondence. The law requires criminal police, who remain part of the internal security structure, to obtain a search warrant from a prosecutor before conducting a search, but they sometimes search without a warrant. The KNB has the right to monitor telephone calls and mail, but under the law it must inform the procuracy within 24 hours of such activity.<P>
<B>KYRGYZ REPUBLIC:</B> The 1993 Constitution prohibits unlawful entry into a home against the wishes of the occupant and states that a person's private life, privacy of correspondence, and telephonic and telegraphic communications are protected by law. The law requires the General Procurators's approval for wiretaps, searches of homes, interception of mail, and similar procedures. However, a change in the law weakened these protections by allowing the procurator to give approval for searches over the telephone. In such cases there is then no written proof that a search was approved. Furthermore, in certain cases law enforcement officers may conduct a search and then get approval within 24 hours afterwards. If approval is not given, any evidence seized is inadmissible in court, but the search still may be made. <P>
Personnel and organizations responsible for violations of these privacy rights during the Soviet period have remained largely in place; however, no widespread and systematic violations of the privacy of citizens were reported. Some citizens active in politics or interested in human rights believe that the privacy of their communications was violated. Credible evidence is not available.<P>
<B>LATVIA:</B> The law requires that law enforcement authorities must have a judicial warrant in order to intercept citizens' mail, telephone calls, or other forms of communication. This protection does not apply to the large noncitizen population. <P>
Following press reports that the Ministry of Defense (MOD) counterintelligence service had monitored the office telephones of employees suspected of possible security breaches, a senior MOD official indicated that no warrant was required to conduct such monitoring for internal investigative purposes.<P>
<B>LIECHTENSTEIN: </B>The Constitution provides for personal liberty, and for inviolability of the home, of postal correspondence, and of telephone conversations. No violations were reported. Police need a judicial warrant to search private property.<P>
<B>LITHUANIA:</B> The Constitution provides for the right to privacy. Authorities do not engage in indiscriminate or widespread monitoring of the correspondence or communications of citizens. With the written authorization of a procurator or judge, however, police and the security service may engage in surveillance and monitoring activities on grounds of national security. Except in cases of hot pursuit or the danger of disappearance of evidence, police must obtain a search warrant signed by a prosecutor before they may enter the premises.<P>
It is widely assumed, however, that law enforcement agencies have increased the use of a range of surveillance methods to cope with the expansion of organized crime. There is some question as to the legal basis of this police surveillance, but there are no known cases challenging the legality of surveillance.<P>
<B>LUXEMBOURG:</B> The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>MACEDONIA:</B> The right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence is provided for in the Constitution. Although no instances of abuses were substantiated, officials of an ethnic Serbian political party charged that their telephones were tapped and their privacy violated by the state security service. They also complained about an incident in which police entered the party offices and demanded that a portrait of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic be taken down.<P>
<B>MALTA:</B> The Constitution protects privacy of the home and prohibits electronic surveillance. The Government respects these provisions. Police officers with the rank of inspector and above may issue search warrants based on perceived reasonable grounds for suspicion of wrongdoing.<P>
<B>MOLDOVA:</B> Prosecutors may issue search warrants. In some instances, searches are conducted without warrants. Courts do not exclude evidence that was illegally obtained. There is no judicial review of search warrants. <P>
The Constitution specifies that searches must be carried out "in accordance with law" but does not specify the consequences if the law is not respected. It also forbids searches at night, except in the case of flagrant crime. <P>
It is widely believed that the security forces continued to use electronic monitoring of residences and telephones of opponents of the Government. By law, the prosecutor's office must authorize wiretaps and may do so only if a criminal investigation is under way. In practice, the prosecutor's office lacks the ability to control the security organizations and police and prevent them from using wiretaps illegally.<P>
<B>MONACO: </B>The Constitution provides for the individual's right of privacy in personal and family life, at home, and in correspondence, and the Government respects these rights in practice.<P>
<B>NETHERLANDS:</B> The law prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>NORWAY: </B>Both the Constitution and law prohibit such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>POLAND: </B>The Constitution provides for the right to privacy of correspondence. There is no legislation that guarantees the general right to privacy, although Poland has signed the European human rights convention, which provides for that right. In response to the growing threat of organized crime and money laundering, the Parliament passed a law in July permitting the police and secret services to monitor private correspondence and to use wire taps and electronic monitoring devices in cases involving a serious crime, narcotics, money laundering, or illegal arms sales. The Minister of Justice and the Minister of Interior, both political appointees, must authorize these investigative methods. In emergency cases, the police may initiate an investigation using wiretaps or opening private correspondence at the same time that they file an application for permission with the ministries to engage in these activities. There is no independent judicial review of these decisions nor is there a control mechanism over how the information derived from these investigations will be used. <P>
The law forbids arbitrary forced entry into homes. Search warrants issued by a prosecutor are required in order to enter private residences. In emergency cases when a prosecutor is not immediately available, police may enter a residence with the approval of the local police commander. In the most urgent cases, in which there is not time to consult with the police commander, police may enter a private residence after showing their official identification. There were no reports that police abused search warrant procedures.<P>
<B>PORTUGAL and MACAU:</B> The Constitution forbids such practices, and its provisions are respected in practice. Violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.<P>
<B>ROMANIA:</B> The Constitution provides for legal protection against the search of a residence without a warrant, but this protection is subordinate to "national security or public order." The 1992 National Security Law defines national security very broadly and lists as threats to national security not only crimes such as terrorism, treason, espionage, assassination, and armed insurrection, but also totalitarian, racist, and anti-Semitic actions or attempts to change the existing national borders. Security officials may enter residences without proper authorization from a prosecutor if they deem a threat to national security "imminent." <P>
The Constitution further states that the privacy of legal means of communication is inviolable; thus, the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) is legally prohibited from engaging in political acts (e.g., monitoring the communications of a political party). However, the laws on national security allow security services to engage in such monitoring on national security grounds. Similarly, although the law requires the SRI to obtain a warrant from a prosecutor to carry out intelligence activities involving "threats to national security," it may engage in a wide variety of operations, including "technical operations," to determine if a situation meets the legal definition of a "threat to national security." <P>
In 1995 arbitrary interference with citizens' right to privacy was rare. However, both citizens and foreign diplomats credibly reported opened mail, personal surveillance, and harassment. The official response to such complaints was that the SRI was not involved and that unreconstructed agents of the Securitate--the Communist-era internal intelligence service--or independent individuals were responsible.<P>
<B>RUSSIA:</B> The Constitution states that officials can enter a private residence only in cases prescribed by federal law or on the basis of a judicial decision. It permits the Government to monitor correspondence, telephone conversations, and other means of communication only with court orders. It prohibits the collection, storage, utilization, and dissemination of information about a person's private life without his consent. The implementing legislation necessary to bring these provisions into effect has not yet been passed. <P>
New laws on the Federal Security Service and on operative searches and seizures significantly strengthened the legal powers of the FSB and other internal security agencies. The April 3 law on the FSB provides it with broad law enforcement functions--fighting crime and corruption--in addition to its previous security and counter-intelligence tasks. The law details the circumstances under which FSB agents may enter a private residence, office, or other premises without prior judicial approval. There must be either sufficient grounds to believe that a crime is in progress or has been committed or a belief that the welfare of citizens is endangered. In such cases, the FSB must notify the Prosecutor within 24 hours of the entry.<P>
Despite the expansion of the FSB's powers, the law provides for only limited oversight and contains unclear human rights provisions. The law vests the Procurator General with the power to oversee the FSB's activities. However, it denies such oversight authority in the areas of informants, organization, tactics, methods, and means of implementation. The role of the Parliament is limited to that of monitoring the FSB.<P>
The August 12 law on operative searches and seizures granted to seven internal security agencies, including the FSB, the right to engage in a variety of clandestine activities, some of which could be carried out in the absence of prior judicial approval. The law does bring the use of wiretaps and searches and seizures into conformity with the Constitution by introducing, for the first time in Russia, a requirement that wiretaps in criminal cases be approved by a judge rather than a prosecutor. However, although this approval could be given after the fact in some cases, some human rights experts believe that the Constitution requires prior judicial approval in certain instances. Government officials can still conduct wiretaps in criminal investigations without court review, but evidence obtained in this fashion would not be admissable in court. <P>
The August law permits agents to open mail, tap telephones, monitor other forms of communication, and enter a private residence without a court order in cases of emergency that may lead to the commission of a serious crime or if Russia's political, military, economic, or environmental security is threatened. In these cases, a judge must be notified within 24 hours of the action. Within 48 hours of the start of such an action, the agency must either receive a court order permitting it or end it. The law does not define what would constitute either a case of emergency or the term "security." <P>
As is the case with the FSB law, oversight is weak. Information concerning the organization, tactics, methods and means of investigations is off limits to the prosecutor. Similarly, the role of the Parliament is limited.<P>
Human rights groups charge that the FSB is stepping up harassment of domestic critics and certain other groups. For example, in December FSB agents confiscated material on human rights abuses in Chechnya from a group of Russian human rights activists on their way to an international meeting (see Section 4 and the cases of Sergay Grigoryants and Viktor Orekhov described in Sections 1.a. and 1.d.). In addition, the FSB accused the Norwegian environmental Bellona Foundation of collecting state secrets on Russia's Northern Fleet in October. The group had been gathering material for a second report on the Fleet's nuclear waste. The FSB raided the group's Murmansk office, confiscating all material on the Fleet's nuclear waste sites as well as computers and video cameras, interrogated researchers working on the study, and searched many of their homes. Others cooperating with Bellona in Murmansk, St. Petersburg, and Severodbinsk also were interrogated and subject to apartment searches. According to the Moscow Times, the Bellona Director asserted that the FSB's objective seemed to be to intimidate Russians from working with the foundation.<P>
<B>SAN MARINO:</B> The law prohibits such practices. Government authorities respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>SERBIA-MONTENEGRO:</B> Federal law gives republic Ministries of the Interior sole control over the decision to monitor potential criminal activities, a power routinely abused. Authorities regularly monitored opposition and dissident activity, eavesdropped on conversations, read mail, and tapped telephones. The federal post office registered all mail from abroad, ostensibly to protect mail carriers from charges of theft. <P>
Although the law includes restrictions on searches, officials often ignored them. In Kosovo and Sandzak, police systematically subjected ethnic Albanians to random searches of their homes, vehicles, shops, and offices, asserting that they were searching for weapons. CDHRF records showed that Serbian police raided 2,324 Kosovar Albanian homes. Photos of homes which had been searched by police showed chaos--furniture broken, bedding tossed around, drawers emptied out. On May 21, the home of Heset Vishi, who was living abroad with his family, was raided by the police, and in his absence the police arrested his brother, ransacked his home, and confiscated his typewriter and a computer. <P>
Authorities entered a clinic ward in Djakovica on May 31 and interrogated a woman about the activities of her husband 4 hours after she had given birth. Two plainclothes detectives entered the apartment of Hava Mustafa in Pristina on June 11 without a search warrant. They beat the daughter who asked who they were and why they had burst into the apartment. When the mother intervened, she was struck by the police. <P>
Serb paramilitaries evicted Muslims from land near Priboj on the Bosnian border, claiming they might be in danger. The Muslims were not allowed to harvest their crops but told that they must pay property taxes or lose their medical benefits. Several of the Muslim-owned homes were set on fire in June. <P>
In June the Serbian police began to round up men of military age, including official and undocumented refugees and some citizens, to fight with ethnic Serb forces in Croatia (the Krajina) and Bosnia. The men were summarily placed in busses and against their will transported across the border without being allowed to communicate with their families (see also Section 2.d.). One refugee from Sarajevo, whose mother was a <P>
Muslim and father a Serb, said that he felt like an animal being hunted down. A woman who took part in a hunger strike staged in front of the Serbian presidency building by relatives of the men who had been forcibly mobilized, said that her husband had been taken away in the middle of the night by police on June 20. Although he showed his valid Serbian identification card, he was seized because he had spent his school years in Rijeka (now Croatia, but then part of Yugoslavia). In late summer, police continued to stop young men for document checks, reportedly sending some to training camps run by the notorious criminal and paramilitary "Arkan" in Erdut in Eastern Slavonia. <P>
The laws regarding desertion from the military lent themselves to abuse. While compulsory military service was the norm in the former Yugoslavia, there were large-scale desertions when the war broke out in 1991 by men of all ethnic groups who chose to walk away from the military rather than take part in interethnic conflicts. Men of military age continued to be stopped on the street for identity checks and subjected to arbitrary harassment and possible forced recruitment. Young men of Croatian or Albanian descent, in particular, refused to fight against Croatia; many of them fled the country under the threat of recruitment. <P>
After doing little for several years to enforce universal military service or track down those who had deserted the military during the 1991 conflict, the military and police began in 1995 once again to recruit members of minority communities, who were understandably reluctant to support conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. Leaders of the Kosovar Albanian community believe that the reintroduction for ethnic Albanians of forced compliance with universal military service was an attempt to induce young men to flee the country. Almost two-thirds of the small 10,000-member community of Croats who had lived in Kosovo for over 700 years emigrated over the past 5 years because of pressure from Serb nationalists and the refusal of the Government to exempt young men from the military. <P>
<B>SLOVAK REPUBLIC:</B> The Criminal Code requires police to obtain a judicial search warrant in order to enter a home. The court may issue such a warrant only if there is a well-founded suspicion that important evidence or persons accused of criminal activity are present inside or if there is some other important reason. Police must present the warrant before conducting the house search or within 24 hours after the search. There were credible allegations that SIS conducted routine surveillance of all senior political figures and their spouses. <P>
In July police with a legal warrant searched the diocesean headquarters of Bishop Rudolf Balaz, Chairman of the Conference of Bishops. The search occurred soon after Balaz had led the Conference in a statement of support for President Michal Kovac, who has been the target of criticism by supporters of Prime Minister Meciar. Police said that Balaz was involved in the illegal sale of art works listed in the register of national treasures. Denying this, Balaz's office director stated that the Government was intent on discrediting Balaz and that police had searched areas clearly inconsistent with their alleged mission. <P>
The 1993 Police Law regulates wiretapping and mail surveillance for the purposes of criminal investigation, which may be conducted, on the order of a judge or prosecutor, only in cases of extraordinarily serious premeditated crimes or crimes involving international treaty <BR>
obligations. <P>
In September the President's son reported that police investigators, while questioning him in connection with his abduction, revealed knowledge of his private domestic conversations that could only have been obtained by electronic surveillance. There were no reports of mail tampering.<P>
<B>SLOVENIA:</B> The Constitution provides protection for privacy, "personal data rights," and the inviolability of the home, mail, and other means of communication. These rights and protections are respected in practice.<P>
<B>SPAIN:</B> The Constitution provides for the privacy of the home and correspondence. Under the Criminal Code, government authorities must obtain court approval before searching private property, wiretapping, or interfering with private correspondence. The present antiterrorist law gives discretionary authority to the Minister of Justice and Interior to act prior to obtaining court approval "in cases of emergency." There were no complaints that the Minister abused this authority. <P>
In June the press published allegedly leaked official documents suggesting that the National Intelligence Agency (CESID) intercepted and recorded telephone conversations between 1984 and 1991. Private calls made by the King, various ministers, and other prominent figures were apparently taped and stored at CESID. The scandal resulted in the resignation of CESID's director, the Minister of Defense, and the Vice President. Investigation and litigation concerning the matter continues.<BR>
<B><BR>
SWEDEN: </B>The law limits home searches to investigations of crimes punishable by at least 2 years' imprisonment, such as murder, robbery, rape, arson, sabotage, counterfeiting, or treason. The authorities respect this provision. Normally, police must obtain court approval for a search or a wiretap; however, a senior police official may approve a search if time is a critical factor or the case involves a threat to life. A parliamentary committee each year reviews all monitoring of telephones, facsimile (fax), or computers.<P>
<B>SWITZERLAND:</B> Cantonal laws regulate police entry into private premises. These regulations differ widely from canton to canton, but all prohibit such practices without a warrant. All government authorities respect these provisions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.<P>
<B>TAJIKISTAN: </B>Articles 22 and 23 of the Constitution provide for the inviolability of the home and prohibit interference with correspondence, telephone conversations, and postal and communication rights, except "in cases prescribed by law." Police may not enter and search a private home without the approval of the procurator. In some cases, police may enter and search a home without permission, but they must then inform the procurator within 24 hours. Police are permitted to enter and search homes without permission if they have compelling reason to believe a delay in obtaining a warrant would impair national security. There is no judicial review of police searches conducted without a warrant. <P>
There are continuing credible reports of arbitrary illegal search and seizure by government forces.<P>
<B>TURKEY: </B>The Constitution provides for the inviolability of a person's domicile and the privacy of correspondence and communication. Government officials may enter a private residence or intercept or monitor private correspondence only upon issuance of a judicial warrant. These provisions are generally respected in practice outside the state of emergency region. <P>
A judge must decide whether to issue a search warrant for a residence. If delay may cause harm, prosecutors and municipal officers authorized to carry out prosecutors' instructions may conduct a search. Searches of private premises may not be carried out at night, unless the delay will be damaging or the search will result in the capture of a prisoner at large. Exceptions include persons under special observation by the Security Directorate General, places anyone can enter at night, places where criminals gather, places where materials obtained through the commission of crimes are kept, gambling establishments, and brothels. <P>
In the 10 provinces under emergency rule, the regional governor can and does empower security authorities to search without a warrant residences or the premises of political parties, businesses, associations, or other organizations. According to the bar association, it is not constitutional for security authorities in these provinces to search, hold, or seize without warrant persons or documents. Roadblocks are commonplace in the southeast; security officials regularly search vehicles and travelers. <P>
Security forces have compelled the evacuation of villages in the southeast to prevent villagers from giving aid and comfort to the PKK (see Section 1.g.). The Government admits to village and hamlet evacuations but claims that they occur as the consequence of pressures by and fear of the PKK and because security operations against the PKK in the region make continued occupancy unsafe.<P>
<B>TURKMENISTAN: </B>The Constitution provides for the right of protection from arbitrary interference by the State in a citizen's personal life. However, there are no legal means to regulate the conduct of surveillance by the state security apparatus, which regularly monitors the activities of opponents and critics of the Government. Security officials use physical surveillance, telephone tapping, electronic eavesdropping, and the recruitment of informers. Critics of the Government, and many other people as well, report credibly that their mail is intercepted before delivery.<P>
<B>UKRAINE:</B> Search warrants issued by prosecutors, not judges, are required and utilized in most cases. The SBU may, however, conduct intrusive surveillance and searches without a warrant on national security grounds. Human rights observers report receiving no complaints of invasion of privacy by the SBU. According to the SBU charter, persons subject to surveillance must be informed after a month's time. The Prosecutor General's office has oversight responsibility over the SBU, but the extent to which it utilizes that authority to monitor SBU activities and to curb excesses by security officials is unknown. <P>
The remnants of Soviet control mechanisms survive in many guises. Militia personnel have the right to stop vehicles arbitrarily and need no probable cause to initiate extensive document checks and inspection of all parts of the vehicle and its contents. This has become a great source of and inducement to corruption in the militia: citizens who often have committed no violation, or only a minor one, prefer to pay a bribe to avoid time-consuming inspections.<P>
<B>UNITED KINGDOM: </B>Warrants are normally required for a police search of private premises. However, under the EPA, on-duty members of the armed forces or policemen in Northern Ireland may enter any premises if they believe they have "reasonable grounds of suspicion" that the entry is necessary to preserve peace and order.<P>
<B>UZBEKISTAN: </B>By law, search warrants issued by a procurator are required. There is no provision for a judicial review of warrants. There does not appear to be a legal mechanism for authorizing telephone wiretapping or monitoring. Security agencies nonetheless monitor telephone calls, and there is evidence that they employ surveillance and wiretap telephones in the cases of persons involved in opposition political activities. Certain high-profile opposition activists were the subject of very visible surveillance, including round-the-clock police monitoring of all movements.<P>
<BR>
<H2><B>NEAR EAST AND NORTH AFRICA</B></H2>
<BR>
<B>ALGERIA:</B> Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, the state of emergency authorizes regional governors to issue exceptional search warrants at any time. Security forces often enter residences illegally. The Government fails to ensure that the police adhere to lawful procedures for entering houses or monitoring correspondence. <P>
Armed insurgents often enter private homes either to kill or kidnap residents or to steal weapons, valuables, or food.<P>
<B>BAHRAIN:</B> Under the law, the Ministry of Interior is empowered to authorize entry into private premises without specific judicial intervention. Domestic and international telephone calls and correspondence are subject to monitoring. Police informer networks are extensive and sophisticated. <P>
<B>EGYPT:</B> The Emergency Law has abridged the constitutional provisions regarding the right to privacy. Under the Constitution, homes, correspondence, telephone calls, and other means of communication "shall have their own sanctity, and their secrecy shall be guaranteed." Police must obtain warrants before undertaking searches and wiretaps. Courts have dismissed cases in which warrants were issued without sufficient cause. Police officials who conduct searches without proper warrants are subject to criminal penalties, although these are seldom imposed. <P>
The Emergency Law empowers the Government to place wiretaps, intercept mail and search persons or places without warrants. Security agencies frequently place political activists, suspected subversives, journalists, foreigners, and writers under surveillance, screen their correspondence (especially international mail), search them and their homes, and confiscate personal property. <P>
According to press reports and a local human rights group, in January security forces in Minya Province demolished the homes of 17 individuals who were suspected of membership in terrorist groups. The Government confirms that the demolitions took place, but maintains that they were not authorized. There were no further reports of similar demolitions.<P>
<B>IRAN:</B> The Constitution states that "reputation, life, property, (and) dwelling(s)" are protected from trespass except as "provided by law." However, security forces enter homes and offices, monitor telephone conversations, and open mail without court authorization. In April, the Government began enforcing a ban on the ownership of satellite receiving dishes (see Section 2.a.). The move provides security forces with a pretext for entering private homes. <P>
Paramilitary volunteer forces, including the basijis and hizbollahis, and other security forces monitor the social activities of citizens. Such organizations may harass or arrest women whose clothing does not cover the hair and all of the body except hands and face, or those who wear makeup. Enforcement of such standards of public morality varies with the political climate and the jurisdiction.<P>
<B>IRAQ:</B> The Government frequently disregards the constitutional right to privacy, particularly in cases allegedly involving national security. The law defines security offenses so broadly that authorities are virtually exempt from the legal requirement to obtain search warrants. In 1995 the authorities subjected Iraqis of various ethnic groups and tribal affiliations to searches without warrants (see Section 1.g.). The regime routinely ignores the constitutional provisions safeguarding the confidentiality of mail, telegraphic correspondence, and telephone conversations. The Government periodically jams news broadcasts, including those of opposition groups, from outside Iraq. <P>
The security services and the Ba'ath Party maintain pervasive networks of informers to deter dissident activity and instill fear in the public. Voters in the October "referendum" were required to name relatives on their ballots and, according to some opposition reports, threatened with punishment against their families if they voted against extending Saddam's rule. <P>
In his November report, the Special Rapporteur noted that because of the intrusiveness of the security apparatus "virtually no citizen would risk demonstrating any opposition to the Presidency or Government--or would do so at his mortal peril."<P>
<B>ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES: </B>Although privacy of the individual and the home are generally protected by law, authorities sometimes interfere with mail and monitor telephone conversations. In criminal cases, the law permits wiretapping by court order; in security cases, the order must be issued by the Ministry of Defense. Under emergency regulations, authorities may open and destroy mail on security grounds.<P>
Israeli military authorities in the West Bank may enter private Palestinian homes and institutions without a warrant on security grounds when authorized by an officer of the rank of lieutenant colonel. In conducting searches, the IDF has used forced entries, and has sometimes beaten occupants and destroyed property. <P>
In July IDF soldiers, without identifying themselves, reportedly attempted to enter the home of a Palestinian with American citizenship by force, and then opened fire on the house indiscriminately, damaging the house and its contents while the family was inside. Undercover units have also engaged in destructive and violent behavior during searches, as well as harassment of families of wanted Palestinians. Israeli authorities claim that forced entry may lawfully occur only when incident to an arrest and when entry is resisted. They maintain that beatings and arbitrary destruction of property during searches are punishable violations of military regulations, and that compensation is due to victims in such cases. The Government does not provide information regarding such compensation. <P>
Security forces may demolish or seal the home of a suspect, whether the owner or tenant, without any trial. The decision to seal or demolish a house is made by several high-level Israeli officials, including the Coordinator of the Civil Administration and the Defense Minister. Owners of houses ordered demolished have 48 hours to appeal to the area commander; a final appeal may be made to the High Court. A successful appeal generally results in the conversion of a demolition order to sealing. After a house is demolished, military authorities confiscate the land and prohibit the owner from rebuilding or removing the rubble. <P>
The number of house demolitions and sealings continued to be low. Authorities demolished one house for security reasons in 1995, compared to one partial demolition in 1994. They also sealed the stairway to the roof of one house, compared to five such sealings in 1994. <P>
Israeli authorities ordered the demolition of the house of the Ramat Gan suicide bomber. The family has appealed the order. The authorities also ordered the demolition of the house of an alleged accomplice in the attack, as well as the house of the Jerusalem suicide bomber. <P>
Many human rights groups maintain that the sealing or demolishing of homes is a form of collective punishment because such acts target innocent families and children. The Israeli High Court has stated that the goal of such demolitions is to deter terrorists. <BR>
Owners may apply to regional military commanders for permits to rebuild or unseal their homes. In December 1994, the Israeli Government decided to allow the opening or rebuilding of homes sealed or demolished as a result of security offenses committed by a family member who had been released from prison. Each former prisoner must apply for a rebuilding or unsealing permit after which the Government will approve or reject the application. In March the IDF unsealed about 40 houses in the West Bank, many sealed since the 1970's, as a goodwill gesture to mark a Muslim holiday. <P>
The IDF continued using heavy weapons to destroy houses believed to be the hiding places of security suspects. In at least 3 cases, houses were destroyed apparently to punish families believed to have harbored suspects. In one case in Hebron, 2 houses were demolished reportedly as a result of their proximity to an orchard in which a wanted person had sought refuge. According to official Israeli sources, 5 houses were demolished in 1995 in military operations, a decrease from 12 in 1994. A wall dividing two houses was also partially demolished in one military operation. <P>
Israeli security services sometimes monitor the mail and telephone conversations of Palestinians resident in PA areas and the West Bank. The authorities sometimes interrupt telephone service and electricity to specific areas. <P>
In Gaza and Jericho, the existing law requires that a chief prosecutor issue warrants for entry and searches of private property. These requirements are occasionally ignored in Palestinian police sweeps for security suspects. Homes have been searched without the consent of their owners; in some cases police have forcibly entered premises, destroying doors and windows.<P>
<B>JORDAN:</B> The authorities generally respect the Constitutional prohibitions of such practices. In most cases, the police must obtain a warrant from the Prosecutor General or a judge before conducting searches. However, in security cases, authorities sometimes--in violation of the law--obtain warrants retroactively or obtain preapproved warrants. Security officers reportedly monitor telephones, read correspondence, and engage in surveillance of persons who allegedly pose a threat to the regime. While these practices are not believed to be widespread, the law permits them if the Government obtains a court order.<P>
<B>KUWAIT: </B>The Constitution provides for individual privacy and sanctity of the home. The police must obtain a warrant to search both public and private property, unless they are in hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime, or if alcohol or narcotics are suspected on the premises. The warrant can be obtained from the state prosecutor or, in the case of private property, from a judge. The security forces occasionally monitor the activities of individuals and their communications.<P>
By law males must obtain government approval to marry foreign-born women. However, the Government does not vigorously enforce this restriction, and Kuwaitis routinely obtain exemptions from the Ministry of Justice. The Government also advises women against marrying foreign nationals.<P>
<B>LEBANON:</B> While the authorities generally show little interest in controlling the personal lives of citizens, they are not reluctant to interfere with the privacy of persons regarded as foes of the Government. Laws require that prosecutors obtain warrants before entering houses except when the army is in hot pursuit of an armed attacker.<P>
The Government uses informer networks and monitors telephones to gather information on its adversaries. In May the Prime Minister announced that he would refer cases to the Prosecutor-General to prevent the intelligence services from tapping telephone conversations. Additionally, in a note to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, the Prime Minster said that he would hold private cellular phone companies responsible should they allow government agencies to tap cellular phones without warrants.<P>
Militias and non-Lebanese forces operating outside areas of central government authority have frequently violated rights of privacy. Various factions also use informer networks and monitor telephones to obtain information on their adversaries.<P>
<B>LIBYA:</B> The Government does not respect the right to privacy. Security agencies often disregard the legal requirement to obtain warrants before entering a private home. They also routinely monitor telephone calls.<P>
The security agencies and the Revolutionary Committees oversee an extensive informant network. Libyan exiles report that mere family ties to suspected regime opponents may result in government harassment and detention. The Government may seize and destroy property belonging to the "enemies of the people" or those who "cooperate" with foreign powers. In the past, citizens have reported that Qadhafi has warned members of the extended family of any regime opponent that they too risk the death penalty.<P>
There were no known developments in a government move to seize "excessive" amounts of private wealth. In 1994 Qadhafi had proposed a program to seize all private assets above a nominal amount, describing wealth in excess of such an undetermined nominal amount as the fruits of exploitation or corruption.<P>
<B>MOROCCO and WESTERN SAHARA:</B> The Constitution states that the home is inviolable and that no search or investigation may take place without a search warrant issued in compliance with the law. The law stipulates that a search warrant may be issued by a prosecutor on good cause. This stipulation is not always observed, however, and there continue to be reports of illegal searches of the homes and offices of suspected political activists. <P>
Government security services monitor certain persons and organizations, both foreign and Moroccan, including their telephones and mail. Government informers also monitor activities on university campuses<P>
<B>OMAN:</B> The police are not required by law to obtain search warrants. There is a widespread belief that the Government eavesdrops on both oral and written communications, and Omanis are guarded in both areas. Citizens must obtain permission from the Ministry of Interior to marry foreigners, which is not automatically granted. In one recent case, officials at an Omani embassy abroad confiscated the passport of an Omani woman who had married a European national without permission from her father or the Government. When her husband traveled alone to Oman to discuss the marriage with his wife's family, he was placed under arrest. The man was allowed to depart the country after his wife surrendered her passport and his government intervened on his behalf.<P>
<B>QATAR:</B> Traditional attitudes of respect for the sanctity of the home provide a great deal of protection against arbitrary intrusions for most citizens and residents of Qatar. A warrant must normally be obtained before police may search a residence or business, except in cases involving national security or emergencies. However, warrants are issued by police officials themselves rather than by judicial authorities. There were no reports of unauthorized searches of homes in 1995. The police and security forces are believed to monitor the communications of suspected criminals, those considered to be security risks, and selected foreigners.<P>
With prior permission, which is usually granted, Qataris may marry foreigners of any nationality and apply for residence permits for their spouses.<P>
<B>SAUDI ARABIA:</B> The sanctity of family life and the inviolability of the home are among the most fundamental of Islamic precepts. Royal decrees announced in 1992 include provisions calling for the Government to defend the home from unlawful incursions. <P>
The police must generally demonstrate reasonable cause and obtain permission from the provincial governor before searching a private home, but warrants are not required. However, some Mutawwa'in continued to enter homes forcibly, searching for evidence of non-Islamic behavior, and harassing and abusing perceived transgressors. <P>
Customs officials routinely open mail for contraband including material deemed pornographic as well as non-Muslim religious material. They regularly confiscate materials deemed offensive. The authorities use informants, wiretaps, and open mail in internal security matters. <P>
The Government enforces most social and Islamic religious norms, which are matters of law (see Section 5). Women may not marry non-Saudis without government permission; men must obtain approval from the Ministry of Interior to marry women from countries outside the 6 states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Although women are prohibited from marrying non-Muslims, men have the right to marry Christians and Jews, in accordance with Islamic law. <P>
Both citizens and foreigners were targets of harassment by members of the Mutawwa'in and by religious vigilantes acting independently of the Mutawwa'in. The Government enjoins the Mutawwa'in to follow established procedures and to offer instruction in a polite manner; following especially egregious altercations, the authorities have temporarily exerted tighter control over the Mutawwa'in. The Government, however, has not condemned the actions of religious vigilantes or sought to disband such groups. <P>
Mutawwa'in enforcement of strict standards of social behavior included the closure of commercial establishments during the daily prayer observances, modest dress in public, and avoidance of video tape rental shops. They harassed Saudi and foreign women for failure to observe strict dress codes, and for being in the company of males who are not their close relatives. They also harassed and arrested non-Muslims attempting to conduct religious services (see Section 2.c.).<P>
<B>SYRIA: </B>Although laws provide for freedom from arbitrary interference, the Emergency Law authorizes the security services to enter homes and conduct searches with warrants if security matters- very broadly defined--are involved. The security services selectively monitor telephone conversations and facsimile transmissions and interfere with the mail. The Government opens mail destined for both citizens and foreign residents. It also prevents the delivery of human rights materials. <P>
There are fewer police checkpoints on roads and in cities and towns than in previous years. Generally, the security services set up such checkpoints to search for smuggled goods, weapons, narcotics, and subversive literature. The searches take place without warrants. The Government and the Ba'th Party have also tried to restrict some citizens from visiting cultural centers operated by foreign embassies.<P>
<B>TUNISIA:</B> The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person and the home and for the privacy of correspondence, "except in exceptional cases defined by law." Police must have warrants to conduct searches, but this requirement is sometimes ignored in cases in which the authorities consider that state security is involved or in which a "flagrant crime" is deemed to have been committed. The authorities closely monitor the activities of Islamists and leftists, search their homes without warrants, and harass their relatives and associates by repeatedly interrogating them. The authorities have also interfered with the delivery of the mail. Police presence is heavy throughout the country. Traffic officers routinely stop motorists to examine their identity and vehicular documents.<P>
<B>UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: </B>The Provisional Constitution prohibits entry into homes without the owner's permission, except in accordance with the law. Although the police may enter homes without a warrant and without demonstrating probable cause, an officer's actions in searching premises are subject to review, and he is subject to disciplinary action if he acts irresponsibly. Officials other than a police officer must have a court order to enter a private home. Local custom and practice place a high value on privacy, and entry into private homes without the owner's permission is rare. There is no known surveillance of private correspondence.<P>
<B>YEMEN, REPUBLIC OF: </B>Despite constitutional provisions against government interference with privacy, security forces routinely search homes and private offices, monitor telephones, read personal mail, and otherwise intrude into personal matters for alleged security reasons. Such activities are conducted without legally issued warrants or judicial supervision. Security forces regularly monitor telephone conversations and have interfered with the telephone service of government critics and opponents.<P>
<BR>
<H2><B>SOUTH ASIA</B></H2>
<BR>
<B>AFGHANISTAN:</B> Intrafactional fighting often resulted in the homes and businesses of civilians being invaded by the opposing forces--whether victor or loser. Armed gunmen acted with impunity given the absence of any legal protection from the law or a responsive police force. In March after capturing the Karte Seh district in southwestern Kabul from the Taliban and anti-Rabbani Shi'a forces, Masood's troops went on a rampage, systematically looting whole streets and raping women. In one case reported by Reuters, government troops broke a man's arms with shovels and beat his wife when he tried to stop them from looting his home. In February, after General Dostam's forces took the northern city of Kunduz, they engaged in widespread, systematic looting of the city, including homes, stores, and offices.<P>
<B>BANGLADESH: </B>The law requires authorities to obtain a judicial warrant before entering a home. However, human rights monitors assert that the police rarely obtain warrants, and officers violating the procedure are not punished. In addition, the SPA permits searches without a warrant. Some opposition members and CHT tribal leaders maintain that the intelligence services illegally monitor their telephones and mail.<P>
<B>BHUTAN: </B>There are no laws providing for these rights, but cultural traditions are highly respectful of personal privacy. However, the Government has undermined these traditions by its emphasis on promoting national integration. The wearing of national dress, for example, is required when visiting Buddhist religious buildings, monasteries and government offices, in schools and when attending official functions and public ceremonies. According to human rights groups, police regularly conduct house to house searches for suspected dissidents without explanation or legal justification.<P>
<B>INDIA: </B>The police must obtain warrants for searches and seizures. In a criminal investigation, the police may conduct searches without warrants to avoid undue delay but they must justify the searches in writing to the nearest magistrate with jurisdiction over the offense. The authorities in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Assam have special powers to search and arrest without a warrant.<P>
The Indian Telegraph Act authorizes the surveillance of communications, including monitoring telephone conversation and intercepting personal mail--in case of public emergency or "in the interest of the public safety or tranquility." These powers have been used by every state government.<P>
<B>MALDIVES: </B>The Constitution prohibits security officials from opening or reading letters, telegrams, and wireless messages or monitoring telephone conversations, "except in accordance with the specific provisions of the law." The NSS may open the mail of private citizens and monitor telephone conversations if authorized in the course of a criminal investigation. <P>
Although the Constitution requires the authorities to respect private premises and dwellings, there is no legal requirement for search or arrest warrants. The Attorney General or a commanding officer of the police must approve the search of private residences.<P>
<B>NEPAL:</B> The Government generally respected the privacy of the home and family. Search warrants are required before search and seizure except in cases involving suspected security and narcotics violations. As amended, the Police Act of 1955 empowers the police to issue warrants for search and seizure in criminal cases upon receipt of information about criminal activities. Within 24 hours of their issuance, warrants in misdemeanor cases must be approved by the CDO. Court judges must approve them in felony cases.<P>
<B>PAKISTAN:</B> By law the police must obtain a warrant to search a house but do not need a warrant to search a person. However, the police often enter homes without a warrant, and frequently steal valuables during searches. In the absence of a warrant, a policeman is subject to charges of criminal trespass. However, policemen are seldom punished for illegal entry. <P>
The Government maintains several domestic intelligence services which monitor politicians, political activists, suspected terrorists, and suspected foreign intelligence agents. Credible reports indicate that the authorities commonly resort to wiretapping and occasionally intercept and open mail. On July 1, the Government suspended cellular phone, card pay phone, and pager services in Karachi and Hyderabad. The Government accused the MQM/A and criminals of using these services to commit crimes in Sindh.<P>
<B>SRI LANKA: </B>The Government generally respects the constitutional protections of individual privacy and the sanctity of the family and home. The police obtain proper warrants for arrests and searches conducted under ordinary law. However, the security forces are not required to obtain warrants for searches conducted under the PTA (see Section 1.e.). The Secretary of Defense is responsible for providing oversight for such searches. There is no judicial review or other means of redress for alleged illegal searches under the PTA. <P>
The Government is believed to monitor telephone conversations and correspondence on a selective basis. The security forces routinely open mail destined for the LTTE-controlled areas and seize contraband. <P>
The LTTE routinely invades the privacy of citizens. It maintains an effective network of informants. In 1990 the LTTE evicted thousands of Muslim residents from their homes in the north. They currently live in refugee camps.

Simon Davies     <BR>
Convener     <BR>
Privacy International     <BR>
Sydney  Australia<BR>
     <BR>
This report provides our first opportunity to communicate with all members of Privacy International, many of whom have patiently waited for eighteen months for a firm indication of the shape and direction that the organisation will take. I hope this publication will achieve that end, and that it will help to establish a firm structure for Privacy International.<P>
As many of our members well know, Privacy International has survived an unusual and somewhat chaotic genesis. Rather than emerging from a structured process, as have a great many successful world-wide organisations, it has come about through a sort of spontaneous combustion. Members in several countries have worked in an informal manner to achieve resolution of the major issues. <P>
The initial result, however, has surpassed our expectations. Over the past eighteen months, through a co-operative voluntary effort, we have established the most comprehensive  and diverse group of privacy experts ever assembled. Experts and advocates from more than 40 countries are now involved. The  network  has created a much needed fusion between the new era of privacy (data protection and trans border data
flow) and the more traditional area of physical and surveillance privacy. <P>
   In playing my own part in helping to establish Privacy International, I have been guided by the goal of cooperation rather than consensus. Virtually all privacy advocates agree that juridical approaches to privacy problems are unlikely to provide the sole solution, but it is equally true that an advesarial approach is only part of the answer. In the ideal world, advocates, activists and technocrats should be able to communicate, even if they never speak the same language. The international community should surely seek some degree of common ground before privacy violations become intractable. I have therefore kept foremost in mind two vital requirements, each of which I believe has successfully been reflected in our current development. First, privacy should not be regarded merely as data protection. Data protection appears to be quite clearly a sub
set of privacy, and for the sake of maintaining clarity of the issues it should remain so. If all privacy matters were interpreted as data protection, solutions would generally be juridical and legal rather than being subjected to the broader range of influences. In addition, data protection surely cannot exist where there is no obtainable data, and those familiar with Foucault's principle of the panopticon representing the surveillance state will understand that privacy must surely have wider parameters. <P>
   The second principle in the development of Privacy International is the establishment of a clear nexus between civil liberties (the traditional face of privacy) and data protection (the modern face of privacy).  Many members in countries ruled by totalitarian and military regimes know that invasions of privacy often intersect with violations of other fundamental rights and freedoms. The link between the traditional and modern hemispheres of privacy is vital to ensure that privacy protection remains a vital and pro-active issue for the people, and not simply the domain of technocrats. If privacy is indeed a reflection of the power relationships in society, then the pursuit of its protection must surely be groundbreaking and energetic. Such countries as Germany, the Netherlands and Australia which have witnessed extensive campaigns to protect privacy have learned that protection of these rights requires a constant testing of political limits.<P>
   The first days of our organisation have reaped an impressive result. Privacy International as a network has generated the focus for direct advocacy in several countries, and has provided assistance to a great many agencies, legal bodies, advocates and researchers. The mere existence of an international network has established a new facet within privacy. <P>
It is indeed true that both the lack of formal structure and funding have limited the activities of the group. On the other hand, the long term success of Privacy International (contrary to popular wisdom) will have relatively little to do with the availability of institutional funding.  Its success will depend more on the synergy of the network, and our capacity to make efficient use of our limited resources.  I, for one, am guided by the premise that seminal concepts such as ours should  concentrate first and foremost on the establishment of a consciousness. Other resources will follow.<P>
   This publication is the fore-runner of Privacy International's first annual report, which we hope to produce late in 1992. The current document has several purposes. It is designed, primarily, to provide a contact list of  the organisation's key people around the world. Its secondary purpose is to set out the history of Privacy International, and to discuss options for the organisation's objects and structure. Members in several countries have also produced specific regional reports. Future annual reports will comprehensively cover country and sector reports. <P>
We intend to establish Privacy International as an influential force for the protection of privacy and freedoms. The co-operative effort that has brought us to this point will ensure that we achieve this goal. It is tempting to be daunted or even cynical about the chance of success and few people would, I suppose, be reckless enough to make predictions or to set ambitious goals. Nevertheless, with the intention of setting some sort of benchmark for our development,  I am happy to put on the record my intention to see Privacy International extended in the next two years to involve at least a thousand members from eighty countries. I would like to see us establish from 1992, a comprehensive and influential annual report, and, in 1993, for us to host the 1st World Privacy and Data Protection Conference. Such is the breadth of the privacy issue that I am certain these goals can be achieved. Given the pace of developments around the world, they must  be achieved. <P>
   My best wishes and thanks go out to all those who have so firmly demonstrated their faith in  the goals of PI. They are too numerous to mention here. My special thanks, however, go out to Graham Greenleaf, Marc Rotenberg, Professor David Flaherty, Pierrot Peladeau, Professor Dr Jon Bing, Dr Jan Holvast, Stephen Saxby, Tom Riley, Stewart Dresner, Professor Ren&eacute; Laperriere, Cecilia Jimenez, Professor James Rule, Justice Michael Kirby, John Grace and William Dwyer for their keen support and encouragement. Thanks are also due to Dr P&aacute;l K&ouml;nyves T&oacute;th, Professor David McQuoid-Mason and Dr Miguel Espino Gonzalez for their input to this report.<P>
   Our warm thanks go also to the Law Faculty and the Human Rights Centre of the University of New South Wales in Sydney, and to Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) in Washington DC for their generous support of Privacy International. Thanks also to John Gilmore, Dr Mechai Viravaidya, the US Privacy Council, the Australian Privacy Foundation and to everyone who contributed financially and otherwise to Privacy International's  activities around the world. <P>

<H3>CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE</H3>
Dr Jan Holvast     <BR>
Chairman     <BR>
Privacy International     <BR>
Amsterdam, The Netherlands<P>
For more than a decade, the privacy problem has continued to gain more and more attention in almost all countries of the world. A large component of this interest has been technological development, but it would be a mistake to pass all blame for privacy violations to technology itself. More important that the technology is the changing political power structure which is one of the consequences of its use. This consequence can lead to repression of those people who oppose the existing power, or who are in a situation where condemnation occurs as a result of prejudice.<P>
This view makes clear my belief that the privacy problem is, primarily, a political problem, although in most countries with a data protection law, the emphasis is on jurisdictional measures. This juridical approach is diverting people from the real problem and the real solutions. Of course, for a political problem we need juridical solutions, but it would be naive, as has sometimes been proposed, to expect that the problem will be solved through that approach.<P>
More important, regarding the international development, is the close cooperation of all those people who are internationally involved in the privacy problem. That's why Privacy International is not only a good idea, but above all, a necessity in a world in which technology generally is used for one purpose : namely, to strengthen the power of those who have it, and almost never for the purpose of strengthening people's rights and freedoms. <BR>
<BR>
With the founding of Privacy International we have not only the obligation to cooperate, but to achieve this cooperation we need a combined approach. Therefore, it will be necessary to reformulate old questions and look at new answers. To mention some :<P>
     -     Are the old definitions of privacy i.e.the old fashioned "right to be left alone" still usable in a technological age, or do we need a redefinition of privacy ?<P>
     -     Is it possible to shape one universal definition of privacy, to do we need to differentiate between countries with cultural and political differences ?<P>
     -     Do we need to develop a broader spectrum of countermeasures other than the common "reactive" approach ?<P>
     -     What are the possibilities for anticipating future developments ?<P>
     -     how can we go beyond information exchange processes and create a change in our situation ?<P>
     -     Is taking about privacy in fact doing no more than using a strange word in place of saying we are afraid of control ?<BR>
<BR>
These and many many other questions demand an answer before we can develop a strong base for a combined solution. And that, in my view, is a key challenge for Privacy International. <P>
<BR>

OVERVIEW, BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF PRIVACY INTERNATIONAL<BR>
OBJECTS AND FUNCTIONS<BR>
THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE ORGANISATION<BR>
STRUCTURE AND RULES<BR>
COMMITTEE AND WORKING GROUP DETAILS<P>
A.     INTRODUCTORY SECTION<P>
1.   Overview of Privacy International :<P>
   During 1990, more than a hundred leading privacy experts and Human Rights organisations from forty countries linked arms to form a World Organisation for the protection of Privacy. Members of the new body, which took the name Privacy International,  had a common interest in establishing an international understanding of the importance of privacy and data protection. Meetings were held throughout that year in North America, Europe, Australasia and South East Asia, and members agreed to work toward the establishment of effective privacy protection throughout the world. A Working Group of 120 leading privacy experts and Human Rights organisations was established to develop Organisational guidelines.<P>
   The formation of Privacy International is the first successful attempt to establish a properly structured world focus on this crucial area of human rights. Privacy International is an independent, non-government organisation with the primary role of advocacy and support. As an international network, the organisation is able to raise the alarm about dangerous technology. As a formal body, it is able to establish guidelines and principles to guard against the malicious or dangerous use of technology. The organisation also assists with the establishment of effective and practicable Privacy legislation.<P>
The work of Privacy International has already found its way into the world's press, including the pages of Time and Scientific American. The organisation has been most  prominent  in the South East Asian region, where it has liaised with local human rights organisations to raise awareness about the development of national surveillance systems. <P>
   Privacy International is managed by a Steering Committee of leading advocates and experts from throughout the World. These people are directly responsible for the liaison of the international Working Group.  This body will function as a broadly based expert group to ensure that Privacy International develops a relevant and effective structure. <P>
   The countries represented on the Working Group are : Australia, Canada , The United States, The United Kingdom,  New Zealand, Panama, Zambia, South Africa, Haiti, The Philippines, France, Germany, Thailand, Japan, Argentina, Costa Rica, India, Zimbabwe, Yugoslavia, Belgium, The Netherlands, Hungary, Poland, Egypt, Israel, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Kenya, Sweden, Hong Kong,  and Chile. The Working Group has a broad range of members, and includes academics, human rights advocates, data protection experts, political scientists, journalists, the judiciary, lawyers, computer professionals, FOI experts, and a limited number of government officials.<P>
   Privacy International has a close working relationship with numerous legal and human rights organisations, many of which are represented on the Committee and Working Group of the organisation. One major affiliation is with the University of New South Wales. The directorate of Privacy International is currently housed within the Law Faculty of the University.  PI's secretariat is located in Washington DC, and is sponsored by Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)<P>
2.  Objects and Functions of Privacy International :<P>
Guidelines for the organisation were circulated in draft form in March 1990, and have been revised several times since.  Following meetings of members in the US, Canada, Australia, the UK, France, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Thailand, New Zealand and the Philippines, general agreement has been reached that Privacy International will have the following objects and functions :<P>
2.1      Objects :<P>
(i)     To raise awareness internationally about privacy issues<P>
(ii)     To work toward the establishment of privacy protection measures throughout the world<P>
(iii)     To facilitate the flow of information about privacy related  matters inside and outside Privacy International<P>
(iv)     To improve the level of mutual support and liaison amongst  privacy advocates<P>
(v)     To provide a comprehensive linkage between privacy, data  protection, and civil liberties advocates<P>
2.2     Functions :<P>
(i)     Monitoring the nature, effectiveness and extent of measures  to protect privacy and personal data;<P>
(ii)     Assessing the impact of new technologies on the privacy and freedom of the individual;<P>
(iii)     Monitoring and reporting on surveillance activities of security forces and intelligence agencies;<P>
(iv)     Monitoring the use by of universal identification systems and mass matching of computer files;<P>
(v)     Assessing the nature, extent and implications of trans border flows of  information between countries.     <P>
(vi)     Functioning as an international clearinghouse for privacy related information, research and issues     <P>
(vii)     Engaging in advocacy at an international level, including making representations to international bodies such as the United Nations, the  Council of Europe and the OECD<P>
(viii)     Monitoring the nature and extent of privacy violations country by country, both in the public and private sector<P>
(ix)     Publishing an international annual report containing description of privacy violations throughout the world<P>
(x)     Seeking ways through which information technology can be used in the protection of privacy<P>
3  Recent activities and campaigns :<P>
During 1991, Privacy International has had significant success in  Thailand, The Philippines and New Zealand  in raising public awareness about the development of surveillance and national ID systems. Simon Davies, the director of PI, returned in August from New Zealand, where, as the guest of the Auckland  Council for Civil Liberties he caused a storm of protest over secret government plans to introduce a multi-purpose universal ID card and data matching programme (which was to be introduced without protecting legislation). The New Zealand Privacy Foundation was formed with 200 founding members, and this group will be the New Zealand representative on Privacy International. <P>
Simon has also had success in the Philippines and Thailand during 1991. The Philippines Senate was considering legislation to establish a national ID card, and in a campaign trip last May hosted by the Philippines Alliance of Human Rights Advocates, submissions were made to the Senate and the Presidential Committee on Human Rights.   The Privacy International network has also been used by law reform and human rights organisations in the US, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and Europe to assist national or local privacy issues.  <P>
4.  Meetings of Privacy International<P>
A recent meeting of PI in Cambridge England considered the question of how members of the Organisation should meet. It was agreed that meetings of Privacy International would be held three times per year at each of the following annual conferences :<P>
1.     The annual Data Protection Commissioners meeting (various locations)<P>
2.     The Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference (US)<P>
3.     The Privacy Laws and Business conference (UK)<P>
The next meeting of Privacy International will be held in Washington DC on March 17th 1991 during the 2nd Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference (being held in Washington between March 18 and 20). The meeting will be convened by Marc Rotenberg, secretary of Privacy International. <P>
5.   The next Phase :<BR>
   Privacy International is currently seeking formal affiliations with academic and other institutions in various countries. It is envisioned that a directorate will be established in the Northern Hemisphere by the middle of 1992, and that regional centres will be formed throughout that year (Europe, Southern Asia, Northern Asia, Africa, Latin America and North America). The 1st Annual Report of the organisation will be circulated by October 1992.<P>
6.    Funding<P>
   Funding to this point has been minimal, but has been possible through the generosity of a small number of individuals and organisations. It is anticipated that by the beginning of 1992, a formal arrangement will be made for base funding. This will be achieved initially through membership subscription, and later through application for institutional funding. <P>

THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRIVACY INTERNATIONAL          <P>
Background and history:<P>
    During the closing months of 1987, millions of Australians  participated in one of the most extraordinary campaigns in their nation's  history. The campaign was sparked by the federal government's intention to introduce a national identity card. For three months, the ID card dominated the media as thousands of people took to the streets in protest at the proposal. <P>
   The Card was to be carried by all Australian citizens and permanent residents (separately marked cards would be issued to temporary residents and visitors). The card was to contain a photograph name, unique number, signature and period of validity, and would have been used to establish the right to employment. It would be necessary for the operation of a bank account, provision of government benefits, provision of health benefits, and for immigration and passport control purposes. <P>
   An unprecedented alliance of political extremes sparked a grass-roots movement against the scheme. Rallies formed on a daily basis, culminating in a protest of 30,000 people outside Western Australia's Parliament House. Before the end of the year, in the face of major protests, a party revolt and civil disobedience, the government scrapped the ID card proposal.<P>
   The Australian Privacy Foundation, a non-partisan group which had convened and directed the campaign, was severely handicapped by the lack of international literature in this area. Throughout the campaign, vague references were constantly made to overseas protests against government ID card and surveillance schemes, but little or no substantial information was available to the campaign leaders. <P>
   Over the following years, members of the Privacy Foundation attempted to collect information from across the world on a variety of privacy related topics, but found that few international connections existed. Individual contacts were useful, but the Foundation came to realise that there existed a gap in this area of human rights on the international scene. <P>
   In March 1990, following discussions with his Australian colleagues, Privacy Foundation Director Simon Davies, a journalist and broadcaster,  travelled to Europe and North America to discuss the prospect of forming a World Privacy Network. This and subsequent journeys were undertaken in a personal capacity, and were not sponsored  or funded by any source. <P>
   The first of many meetings to discuss the idea was held in Luxembourg  on March 26th 1990 , just prior to the joint European Commission and Council of Europe conference on Data Protection and Computer Crime. Mr Davies conducted other meetings throughout the year in Washington, New York, London, Amsterdam, Ottawa, Auckland, Belfast, Bangkok, Toronto and Strasbourg.<P>
The response to the proposal was extremely positive. All experts and advocates agreed that an international liaison was essential, and around thirty leading privacy, civil liberties and data protection experts agreed to help form the organisation  On his return to Australia in May, Davies wrote to these people in the following terms :<P>
    A wide range of views has been expressed about the most appropriate structure, membership, goals and activities of such an organisation. Decisions about these aspects must remain in the plans of the appropriate planning group. However, I feel we can assume that there is unanimous support for a greater degree of international communication and liaison in the privacy arena. We can also conclude that there is an equal degree of support for promotion and lobbying of privacy issues at an international level. <P>
    It was generally felt that, in the first stage, all those who had agreed to join the effort should form a Working Group responsible for the formation of structure and policy. By the end of 1990, this group was about eighty in number, and represented 28 countries. In an editorial in the U.K. based Computer Law and Security Report, Stephen Saxby remarked :<P>
The development is to be warmly welcomed as a serious attempt to improve international collaboration over privacy issues. Just as international human rights groups have established themselves on the world scene, so too can a privacy oriented organisation work toward a higher level of awareness and respect of the issues involved. It is doubly important to develop the organisation now as Eastern Europe moves toward democratic institutions and participation in international fora of many kinds. While many issues still have to be resolved before the organisation can get underway, the encouraging support it has received so forebodes well for the future. The proposal for the organisation is a timely reminder that while many tangible benefits come from new technologies, risks also exist that cannot be ignored.<P>
<H3>The justification for an International Organisation for Privacy:</H3>
The only fears expressed about the formation of an international effort related to the potential erosion of national sovereignty. Most members, however, felt that benefits far outweighed dangers. <P>
Although general agreement had been reached on the scope of the organisation, considerable debate was undertaken with regard to the scope and nature of the organisation.  Professor Ruth Gavison of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel observed:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I share the feeling that invasions of privacy through computers and surveillance will become more important in the future, and that an international organisation may have some relative advantage in dealing with these problems than national civil rights groups, committed as they may be.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
   The Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights saluted the initiative, and confirmed the view that the formation of a privacy network would fill a void in the international scene. In a letter to Simon Davies, Secretary General Bahey El Din Hassan said :<P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE> We are happy to hear of the formation of Privacy International. We believe that such an organisation will fill a certain gap in the structure of the international human rights movement. Giving more attention than customary to civil rights we salute your initiative in this regard and we appreciate your vigorous pursuit of a truly international scope for Privacy International.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
   A Hungarian expert, Dr Pal Konyves Toth, agreed that an international organisation would be valuable in supporting the struggle for recognition in law of privacy and data protection issues :<P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>It may well be that in this period - while data protection and FOI is included in the Hungarian Constitution, but having no statutory guarantees - Privacy International playing the role planned can help us to argue the subject matter by serving the type of information it includes, not speaking about the potential weight of an international community of privacy experts and advocates and experts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<H3>Scope of Privacy International -  Aims and Mandate :</H3>
    Although all members agreed that the organisation should have a primary role in international communication and support, there was some small difference of opinion concerning its proposed advocacy role. The first draft of the Working Group guidelines proposed that Privacy International would have an extremely broad mandate, becoming involved in the full spectrum of privacy issues. This prompted Professor James Rule from New York State University to warn :<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>    My main concern, on reviewing the plans you set forth in your letter, has to do with the breadth of the activities that you are thinking of undertaking. My own preference would be for a relatively focused, strictly independent group of people with ideas of their own and no public policies to defend, who would undertake a limited but hard hitting agenda....I think a group with strong analytical independent ideas could make a significant impact by taking a few conspicuous, well considered public issues each year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
    These concerns were expressed by a number of European and North American members of the Working Group. The main fear was that the organisation would be "too heavy to take off".  Nevertheless, the call for a broad range of organisational interests was substantial. Professor Dr Wolfgang Kilian of Universitat Hannover wrote in the following terms :<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>   I agree that the exchange of proposals and state of the art information should play a major role. Additionally, there should   be broader understanding of the differing national backgrounds for the access of public files, information policy and data privacy protection in private business. Since national organisations exist in many countries which are registered as public lobbyists or experts for public hearings, Privacy International should emphasize the international aspects (transborder data flow, international data security aspects, ISO standards, data flow in multinational organisations). There may be interest in area oriented sub
groups (research, medical field, employees data, funds transfer data, secret services).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
    Part of the concern of some members was the notion that the organisation should consider privacy in its broadest sense. That is, not merely data protection, but also the range of issues concerning surveillance and the relationship between the citizen and organisations.  In other words, a fusion with civil liberties. Whilst some members expressed caution at such an early stage of Privacy International's development, others made quite clear their belief that the fusion would be certain to come about. <BR>
Several European members suggested that the existence of a network that could obtain expertise at short notice, test ideas, and rally international support on specific issues would be an invaluable contribution to privacy protection. It was suggested that in the first stage, working groups might be organised around subject areas which could then provide input to national legislative discussions and international organisations dealing with such subjects (eg telecommunications privacy).<P>
   Washington's David Burnham supported the broader view of privacy when he submitted :<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>I think that a question that should be explored is the ground we cover when we talk about "privacy". To my mind it is much more than the ability of a single individual to prevent others from obtaining information about him. Privacy concerns power, relative power, the power of large public and private organisations over the individual.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<H3>Membership of non-OECD Countries:</H3>
    A very clear decision had to be made from the outset about the countries that would be involved in the organisation. This decision was dependent, largely, on the outcome of discussions relating to the scope of Privacy International. Canadian privacy advocate Pierrot Peladeau was eloquent in his argument for unrestricted membership. He wrote:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The organisation must be involved with countries which do not formally embrace privacy concerns. We cannot efficiently protect privacy interests in OECD countries without a clear vision of what is happening throughout the world, the north with responsibilities toward the south, the west toward the east. The organisation must also be involved  with countries that blatantly violate privacy rights and interests. We must support those countries' civil rights organisations and advocates working on privacy issues by including them in our information links and collaboration networking, but also by giving them the expertise and international pressure they ask for. For this, a fully independent, non-governmental organisation is needed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
    We engaged "Human Rights Internet" based at Harvard Law School to identify organisations in developing countries that might have an interest in the privacy and data protection area. A substantial list was compiled, and a selection of these were approached. About sixty per cent of human rights organisations in developing countries responded favourably. Mirna Anaya, General Coordinator of the Comision para la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos en CentroAmerica in Costa Rica set the following response :<BR>
<BR>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>In general, the privacy issue is one that we in Central America, deal with on a constant basis. Most of the organisations in the "popular sector" throughout Central America are watched and threatened by para-military and military forces. It is often the case that this surveillance and harassment, obviously an infringement of numerous rights that fall under the notion of privacy rights, is followed by illegal captures, lengthy illegal detentions with torture, and disappearance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
    Others, such as the Union of Civil Liberty in Thailand, replied in more general terms :<P>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>We are also interested in the field of privacy and surveillance and also recognise the growth of importance of this field of human rights protection. Therefore we heartfully accept your invitation. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Favourable responses were received from Zambia, Argentina, Costa Rica, Chile, Thailand, The Philippines, Egypt, India and  Haiti. Many expressed concern over the use by governments, security forces and private companies of information technology and modern surveillance equipment. <P>
<H3>Membership of government officials:</H3>
    Unlike the matter of membership of non OECD countries, the question of membership of government officials has not been so clearly resolved. Justice Michael Kirby, president of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, had proposed :<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>   I would favour government officials becoming full or associated members of the network. They should certainly not be excluded. Some government officials have a great deal to contribute to the issues that will come up for discussion. They should be appointed on their own merits as individuals of the highest personal integrity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
   Justice Kirby proposed an intelligent balance in what some members saw as a difficult problem. The correct course of action was clearly to avoid discriminating against government officials. However, because of the advocacy role of Privacy International it seemed that this prospect had its practical limitations. In response to an invitation to membership of the Working Group, United Kingdom Data Protection Commissioner Eric Howe wrote :<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have given careful thought to your invitation but feel that it would not be appropriate to accept it in the light of the position I hold. I do feel it would be too difficult to separate the registrar from Eric Howe and simply appear in a personal capacity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
   John Eichmanis of the Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner's Office also flagged problems when he wrote in February 1991 :<P>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>While we certainly would not want to dissuade the members of Privacy International from taking adversarial positions vis a vis governmental organisations, such a possibility places such offices as ours in a precarious position. I am sure you appreciate our predicament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
   John Grace, then Canadian Privacy Commissioner, accepted an invitation to join the group, but warned :<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>   I should also make clear that I do not want my agreement to serve now in an advisory role to pre-empt the key question as to whether membership in the network should be opened to government officials. This is a basic question which should be decided later. My own instinct, indeed, is that government people, for both their own reasons and the network's, should remain at arms length. But I remain very much open to argument on that matter. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
   On the other hand, Professor Rene Laperriere of the University of Quebec felt that government officials should be approached because they would make a valuable contribution to an international movement :<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>   I think that in order to be functional, this organisation as a pressure group should invite to its membership advocates of privacy and liberties, who do not belong to government or private sector administrations or pressure groups. As to the privacy commissioners, they are in a position of watchdogs of government, and in certain cases private, actions. I suppose that this new organisation should invite them to participate, having in mind that the positions that will be adopted  and the actions undertaken may be critical of the governments as well as the private firms : if they feel comfortable and mandate to work in such direction, their contribution could be most valuable. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Many members now believe that government officials should be permitted to join the Working Group of PI but excluded from the executive or office bearer positions. Their number on the Working Group would be limited to ten per cent of the total number of members. There should be no restriction on the ordinary membership of government officials. <P>
<H3>EXPLANATION OF PROPOSED STRUCTURE, RULES AND FUNCTIONS OF PRIVACY INTERNATIONAL     </H3>
<H3>STRUCTURE</H3>
   Privacy International has yet to adopt a formal and legal structure. This matter must be dealt with as the priority for the Working Group and Committee. It is clear, however, that the organisation will have certain characteristics :<P>
1.   First and foremost, PI is an Association of Members. As an informal network, the organisation will avoid the establishment of concrete structures. Because privacy protection has so many intangible elements, the international structure must be informal. In a way similar  to ICJ, PI can develop a more formal structure at the national or regional level. Any international structure, such as a congress, would have no special authority over national groups. <P>
2.  Special Interest Groups PI will develop a range of specialist sub-groups concerned with particular areas of privacy. These will include :<P>
     Telecommunications privacy     <BR>
     Data Matching     <BR>
     Trans border data flows     <BR>
     Freedom of Information     <BR>
     Finance and banking     <BR>
     Genetic and DNA     <BR>
     Biometric identification     <BR>
     Workplace surveillance     <BR>
     Medical data technology     <BR>
     Security and intelligence services     <BR>
     Data security     <BR>
     Private sector privacy     <BR>
     Public sector privacy     <BR>
     Identity cards     <BR>
     Legislation     <BR>
     Statistical and census data     <BR>
     Vehicle and remote tracking systems     <BR>
     Media privacy     <BR>
     Privacy protective technology<P>
3.    All development will be in the hands of the Working Group.  A Working Group of more than one hundred leading figures in privacy and human rights from 33 countries  will be directly responsible for making decisions about the structure and constitution of the organisation. The Group will comprise a number of committees with <BR>
responsibilities for financial arrangements, membership, legal affairs etc.<P>
4.    A coordinating Committee will manage the organisation.  A committee of fifteen <BR>
members from thirteen countries will have overall responsibility for management of the Working Group. The Committee, nominated at a July 1991 meeting of Privacy International in Cambridge England, will ensure that the Working Group has the material necessary for its deliberations. <P>
5.     Regional and subject management. Because of the vast amount of material that will ultimately be generated by the network, volunteers will be sought to manage the information flow for a region or for a sector (telecommunications privacy etc).<P>
6.      Financial arrangements. Funding for the organisation will be achieved in the first instance through membership subscription. Each member of the Working Group will be asked to secure ordinary members. Regional managers will be responsible for collection, recording and banking of these moneys, and the details will be forwarded to the international finance committee.<P>
<BR>
<H3>WORKING GROUP AND COMMITTEE GUIDELINES</H3>
   The first version of the guidelines for the Working Group were distributed for comment in May 1990, with four subsequent versions being developed. The following is the final version of the guidelines for the Committee and Working Group.      <P>
1.      THE ROLE OF PRIVACY INTERNATIONAL<P>
1.1   Privacy International (The World privacy and Data Protection Network) will be established by these rules as an independent, non-government, participatory international privacy advocacy and monitoring organisation. <P>
1.2      Privacy International will be established with the following objects :<P>
1.2.1     To raise awareness internationally about privacy issues<P>
1.2.2     To work toward the establishment of privacy protection measures throughout the world<P>
1.2.3     To facilitate the flow of information about privacy related  matters inside and outside Privacy International<P>
1.2.4     To improve the level of mutual support and liaison amongst  privacy advocates<P>
1.2.5     To Provide a comprehensive linkage between privacy, data  protection, and civil liberties advocates;<P>
1.3   Privacy International will support the adoption and implementation of the following international instruments :<P>
1.3.1       The United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights, with particular regard to clause 12;<P>
1.3.2      The OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder flows of Personal Data;<P>
1.3.3      The Council of Europe's Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data;<P>
1.4   Privacy International will perform the following functions, plus such other functions as may be decided by the Working Group :<P>
1.4.1     Monitoring the nature, effectiveness and extent of measures  to protect privacy and personal data;<P>
1.4.2     Assessing the impact of new technologies on the privacy and freedom of the individual;<P>

1.4.4     Monitoring the use by of universal identification systems and mass matching of computer files;<P>
1.4.5     Assessing the nature, extent and implications of trans border flows of  information between countries;     <P>
1.4.6     Functioning as an international clearinghouse for privacy related information, research and issues;     <P>
1.4.7     Engaging in advocacy at an international level, including making representations to international bodies such as the United Nations, the  Council of Europe and the OECD;<P>
1.4.8     Subject to sections 4.2.4, 4.2.5 and 4.2.6 below, monitoring the nature and extent of privacy violations country by country, both in the public and private sector<P>
1.4.9     Publishing an international annual report containing description of privacy violations throughout the world;<P>
1.4.10     Seeking ways through which information technology can be used in the protection of privacy;<P>
1.4.11     Assisting local privacy advocates in any country, including countries which do not yet have privacy or data protection legislation, or adequate protection against <BR>
violations of human rights;<P>
1.4.12     Working with other organisations having aims which are compatible with those of Privacy International.<P>
2.     AMBIT OF THE ORGANISATION<P>
2.1     Privacy International may be concerned with a range of human rights violations and privacy related issues, but will be principally concerned with data protection and surveillance;<P>
2.2     In determining the ambit, structure and operation of Privacy International, the Working Group must have regard to the various pre-conditions to the establishment of privacy and data protection safeguards i.e. aspects of civil and political rights, freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, and national economic and technological conditions;<P>
2.3     In accordance with 2.2 above, the organisation's scope will include support for the development of the pre-conditions for privacy protection in countries where the adoption of data protection statutes is not practicable in the near future. Such matters may include reforms to administrative law which aid privacy protection, or particular civil or political rights such as freedom of conscience or freedom of speech, without which privacy protection might lack purpose;<P>
2.4     The organisation will not duplicate the work of other national or international groups involved with human rights.<P>
3.           FORMATION OF THE WORKING GROUP<P>
3.1   The Convener will establish a Working Group to determine the structure and function of Privacy International :<P>
3.1.1  All members of the Working Group will have a credible profile in the fields of privacy, data protection, human rights, or in areas essential to the aims of Privacy International.;<P>
3.1.2   The Working Group will have at least one hundred confirmed members from a minimum of thirty countries;<P>
3.1.3    No single country will have more than fifteen per cent of the total membership of the Working Group;<P>
3.1.4    A maximum of twenty per cent of the Working Group will be statutory office holders or members of government departments.;<P>
3.1.5  Members of  the Working Group will serve solely in a personal capacity, but may take steps to represent their organisations or institutions following the resolution of  Section 4.1 below.<P>
4.           ROLE OF THE WORKING GROUP<P>
4.1    The tasks to be resolved by the Working Group will be divided, for convenience, into two stages. The first and immediate stage comprises the following four issues :<P>
4.1.1      To determine the functions of Privacy International subject to section 1.4 above;<P>
4.1.2      To decide upon an appropriate organisational structure, rules and constitution for Privacy International.;<P>
4.1.3     To determine the form, nature and extent of membership of the organisation;<P>
4.1.4 To determine the method of liaison with international organisations, governments and statutory privacy bodies;<P>
4.2   The second, and longer term, stage of the Working Group's responsibilities are as follows :<P>
4.2.1      To develop a charter or mandate which will serve as a foundation document or set of principles in the work of Privacy International;<P>
4.2.2      To develop a framework for effective communication, liaison and mutual support between members of the organisation;<P>
4.2.3      To consider how the organisation will determine a formal public position on various privacy issues both at a national and international level, and whether such formal positions are desirable or necessary;<P>
4.2.4      To determine the extent to which the organisation will establish national or regional representation;<P>
4.2.5      To determine the limits of involvement by the organisation in the affairs of a country;<P>
4.2.6      To consider how the organisation will determine the balance between the pursuit of universal privacy principles and the adoption at a national level of any of a number of pluralistic definitions of privacy;<P>
4.2.7      To investigate funding options for Privacy International;<P>
4.3   Members of the Working Group may speak publicly about Privacy International subject to the following limitations :<P>
4.3.1    That the public statements relate solely to the charter, role, membership and function of the Working Group;<P>
4.3.2   That the public statements do not imply a position of the organisation on particular issues unless a formal process has been undertaken to ensure that the statements reflect the wishes of members in the relevant country.<P>
5.          CO-ORDINATING COMMITTEE<P>
5.1   A co-ordinating Committee of no more than fifteen members will be established at a meeting of members of Privacy International. Its composition will be determined in broad conformity with section 3.1  above. Members of the Committee will have the following responsibilities :<P>
     5.1.1 Assisting with communications and liaison amongst members of the Working Group;<P>
     5.1.2   Assisting with distribution of information relevant to the functions of the Working Group;<P>
     5.1.3   Where appropriate, publicly representing Privacy International;<P>
     5.1.4 Framing resolutions, developing themes for papers, and generating issues for the attention of the Working Group;     <P>
<BR>
5.2    The Co-ordinating Committee will have no special powers or voting rights;     <P>
5.3   The Working Group by a three quarters majority of returned  votes may delegate part of its function to individual member or groups of members;<P>
5.4    The Co-ordinating Committee, by a three quarters majority vote, may delegate part of its functions to individual members or groups of members;<P>
5.5    Members of the co-ordinating Committee may represent or make representations on behalf of Privacy International, but are not empowered to promote opinions or views on behalf of the organisation unless these have been approved by the Committee;<P>
6.         VOTING PROCEDURE<P>
6.1    The Working Group will remain a single group until such time as agreement is reached on all aspects of the first stage of its functions (section 4.1). After this stage has been reached, the group may divide into specific interest committees in a manner recommended by the Co-ordinating Committee;<P>
6.2   The full Working Group will resolve issues by voting on options presented in working papers commissioned by the Co-ordinating Committee. Voting will proceed in the following manner :<P>
6.2.1      All matters will be decided upon through written resolution circulated to all members of the Working Group;<P>
6.2.2      All resolutions placed before the Working Group will be accompanied by a paper commissioned by the Co-ordinating Committee, and circulated at least 21 days prior to the vote;<P>
6.2.3      Where there is a single option in the resolution, the vote will be carried by a simple majority of returned votes;<P>
6.2.4      Where there are more than two options, preferences will be distributed in order to determine the majority preference;<P>
6.2.5      Wherever possible, these processes will use electronic facilities such as fax, telephone and electronic mail;     <P>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ORGANISATION'S FUNCTIONS<P>
Function  1.4.1     Monitoring the nature, effectiveness and extent of measures  to protect privacy and personal data;<P>
   Over the coming years, Privacy International will establish a grid of national groups and specific interest sub-groups to help determine whether legislative and other measures are achieving the necessary degree of privacy protection. The organisation's primary function is to assist individual countries to develop strong privacy protection. Through its annual report, Privacy International can raise awareness of the need for protections, and through its network of experts, the organisation can follow up with practical assistance.<P>
Function  1.4.2 Assessing the impact of new technologies on the privacy and freedom of the individual;<P>
   The comprehensive assessment of technology and its impact will  be conducted on a sectoral basis. A scan of the Working Group of the organisation reveals that well over fifty per cent of members have specialist expertise that should be networked internationally. During the first half of 1992, Privacy International will develop sectoral privacy sub groups in such fields as telecommunications privacy and data matching.<P>
Existing Working Group members will be approached to occupy the position of convener of these various groups. Membership will be open and will be international in scope. The sub groups will not be bound by sovereign restrictions. <P>
Function  1.4.3 Monitoring and reporting on surveillance activities of security forces and intelligence agencies;<P>
    This is possibly the most sensitive area of involvement for Privacy International, and great care must be exercised to ensure the protection of members who report on the activities of security and intelligence agencies. Whilst there are certain international trends (the trade in surveillance technology, international law enforcement records, regional collaboration etc) the majority of violations are likely to be noted at the national level. Members in some countries may wish to conduct the publication of reports through an international sub-group in the security service and intelligence field.<P>
Function  1.4.4  Monitoring the use of universal identification systems and mass matching of computer files;<P>
   Both these areas will be covered by sub-groups. Universal Identification schemes will also cover the development of population databases, population numbering systems, and multiple purpose numbering systems.<P>
Function  1.4.5 Assessing the nature, extent and implications of trans border flows of  information between countries.<P>
   It is quite possible that the transborder data sub-group  of Privacy International will be an amalgam of several relevant groups including finance and banking, telecommunications privacy, data matching, and data security. <BR>
     <BR>
 Function  1.4.6  Functioning as an international clearinghouse for privacy related information, research and issues     <P>
    This function is currently without definition. The various sub-groups and networks will informally serve a clearinghouse function. Depending on the availability of resources and funding, it is likely that Privacy International will publish a monthly bulletin with abbreviated references to events, material, research, legislation etc. Contact details of a subgroup member or members will be listed alongside the reference.  <P>
Function  1.4.7   Engaging in advocacy at an international level, including making representations to international bodies such as the United Nations, the  Council of Europe and the OECD<P>
   The advocacy role of any international group is a sensitive process. While working toward the development of internationally recognised standards of privacy protection, Privacy International must also recognise the right of individual nations to decide the appropriate form of protection. Thus the advocacy role of Privacy International as it directly affects a nation would be limited to an extent determined by members in the country concerned. It is, however, assumed that all members of Privacy International in all countries broadly support the principles laid down in the OECD and Council of Europe guidelines. Advocacy  at a national or international level for adoption of these principles should be a universally accepted role of the organisation. <P>
Function  1.4.8    Monitoring the nature and extent of privacy violations country by country, both in the public and private sector<P>
   Privacy International will establish a monitoring procedure similar to that of Amnesty International or the International Commission of Jurists. Assessment of privacy invasions within a country will be subject to the following conditions :<P>
(1)  Reports will be prepared by members of Privacy International who are resident in the relevant country, and material will be refereed as extensively as possible by other local members;<P>
(2)   The report in draft form will be passed for comment to other members outside the subject country;<P>
(3)   The subject country is free to request whatever international support is needed in the preparation of reports;<P>
(4)     Privacy International cannot veto or edit reports prepared according to the above procedures;<P>
Function  1.4.9   Publishing an international annual report containing description of privacy violations throughout the world <P>
   An annual report will be published containing reports on individual countries, as well as sector reports by the various sub-groups. Ultimately, the report would cover the majority of the world's countries, and would provide an important benchmark in the development of an international context for privacy protection.<BR>
 <BR>
Function  1.4.10   Seeking ways through which information technology can be used in the protection of privacy<P>
   This is an important function for Privacy International. A vast amount of research is undertaken each year to develop the intrusive capacity of technology, but relatively little focus is given to the privacy protective potential for technology.

<H3></H3>
<H3>OVERVIEW OF THE STATE OF THE WORLD'S PRIVACY</H3>
   The state of privacy protection world-wide is a mixed picture. While privacy and data protection is being taken seriously by more and more countries, advances in technology increase the spectrum of privacy violations. While international relations have generally warmed, minimising certain elements of surveillance of populations,  numerous civil and regional conflicts continue to nurture extensive surveillance. <P>
   New Information Technology is able to deal with personal data faster, more extensively, and at a cheaper cost than ever before. Vast amounts of information are being transacted by systems that are more compatible and networks that are more "open". <BR>
Sadly, while some of this technology (smart cards, encryption etc) has the capacity to help protect personal privacy, relatively little is spent on research in these areas. The vulnerability of information and the consequent loss of privacy are seen as the trade-offs against greater speed, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. <P>
   Protections in law, where they exist, are sometimes ineffective and even counter
productive. Extensive information holdings by government are invariably allowed under exemptions and protections in law. The existence of statutory privacy bodies, rather than impeding such trends, sometimes legitimates intrusive information practices. <P>
   There are, however, some encouraging trends in privacy. The release of the European Commission's Draft Directive on Data Protection has created shock waves throughout the world, particularly within those countries with no effective privacy legislation. The Draft Directive will enforce minimum standards of protection throughout the European Community, and will provide for the veto of information trade with non European countries with a lesser standard of data protection. The potential impact of such a mechanism was recently seen when the U.K. Data Protection Commissioner vetoed certain information based transactions between the U.K. and the United States. There is uncertainty about the date of final drafting of the Directive, although it appears almost certain that this will be achieved by the end of 1992. It is likely that the Directive will give form and force to the cliche "Information as a commodity". <P>
   However, while the European Directive will exert a positive  influence in one direction, the flow of surveillance technology from first world to third world is creating significant problems for human rights in developing countries. While much of this technology has an important and legitimate role to play in economic development, the establishment in the third world of hi-tech population numbering systems and identity card systems is subject to abuse and manipulation. The vast majority of these systems are designed and sold by information technology organisations and brokers in first world countries. Protection of rights in the recipient country often does not exist, and even if a constitutional protection of privacy does exist, it may be unenforceable. A recent decision by the Hungarian Constitutional court to veto a national ID system is a rare example of enforcement of such a document. <P>
    A recent award for "Brave use of technology" given to the government of Thailand by the Smithsonian Institute was condemned by the U.S. Privacy Council (see special report on Thailand in this document). However, while ethical guidelines of the Information Technology industry are little more than paper tigers, the problem of unethical "peddling" of technology will continue.<P>
One of the most interesting and controversial privacy issues is the development of genetic and DNA coding. There have been calls in several countries for the development of national genetic databases, but privacy implications aside, the procedures involved in such technology appear to be embryonic and often haphazard. The absence of uniform licencing, proficiency testing, procedural controls and legislative mechanisms combine to make this technology vulnerable to error, inconsistency or abuse. Even if these procedures and standards were to be perfected, the public interest in the establishment of such databases would appear to limited. The experience of other specific technologies is that the information gained is applied for unforeseen purposes, thus breaching generally held privacy principles, but often exempted under the provisions of law enforcement or public revenue. <P>
     Such embryonic technology exists in several other areas. Vehicle tracking systems, for example, are being embraced throughout the world without general regard to the potential for extension of use. The imminent capacity to track and log vehicles on a metropolitan-wide basis to assist traffic management has applications that go well beyond traffic control. The same syndrome applies across the spectrum of technology.<P>
    The problems arising from such new and seductive technologies often stem from the perceived losses arising from non-implementation, rather than the costs arising from their hasty introduction. <P>
    One critical measure of a country's privacy law is the adequacy of protection for the confidentiality of telecommunications. Many countries have established some restrictions on wire surveillance by government agents. The United States wiretap statute requires that government authorities obtain permission before conducting a wiretap. after the order is issued, there are specific guidelines that must be followed to ensure that the surveillance is "minimised". Other countries have similar requirements, though provisions that allow for wire surveillance simply when a "national Security" concern is suggested should not be considered adequate. Such provisions should be subject to judicial or parliamentary scrutiny. <P>
    The Caller ID service, allowing the recipient of a call to identify the number of the caller,  is generally considered by privacy advocates as a threat to privacy. It tends to transfer control over personal information from the phone subscriber to the phone company. In the United States some phone companies sell both the right to receive the phone number and the right to withhold the disclosure of the phone number. Claims that the Caller ID service would reduce harassing calls appear not to be generally supported. Other phone services address the problem more effectively. Callers should retain the right to decide when to disclose their identities. In advanced telecommunications networks such as ISDN the disclosure of a callers phone number may also result in the disclosure of other personal information,  including age, address, profession, income, and marital status. <P>
Several new problems are emerging on the communications privacy front. With regard to government spying, there is growing concern that governments will seek to restrict the use of cryptography and other methods that allow a person to protect the confidentiality of communications. In the United States, the government sought to require that communication service providers make available the "plain text"  version of encrypted communications. This effort was successfully opposed by privacy advocates, and computer and communications companies.  Cryptography will remain one of the battlegrounds for communications privacy for the foreseeable future.<P>
    A separate problem is the prospect that communications companies will routinely sell the records of specific calls to third parties. This is a new development that arises from the growth of direct marketing and the creation of a digital network that logs individual calls. There are two aspects of this problem. First, the privacy risk is the disclosure of the record of a call, and not the content of a call. Secondly, the information is typically sold to marketing firms and businesses for commercial gain. It is not sought by government in the first instance, though it should be assumed that government may ultimately seek to secure the information. In the U.S. for example, the Internal Revenue Service has purchased detailed lists from private mailing firms to undertake tax audits. <P>
    There is a strong argument that privacy advocates should  oppose the disclosure of both communications content and communications records to private and public parties. When Government seeks this information, it should be disclosed only pursuant to clear legal authority that may be challenged openly in a court of law. When a private company seeks this information, both parties to the communication must provide explicit consent. <BR>
Failure to enforce strong privacy safeguards for communication networks is likely to undermine the core value of a communications service - the assurance that confidential information exchanged between two parties will not be disclosed to others. <BR>
In considering these issues, privacy advocates are confronted with sensitive matters of public interest. Technology brings great benefits, but the vulnerabilities are often overlooked. While striving to apply the international principles of data protection, and allowing for the right of sovereign law, it is difficult to avoid concluding that privacy protection is often controlled by the exception rather than the rule. Privacy is often one of the first rights to be traded off in favour of other perceived benefits, yet, once traded, it can rarely be recovered. Sadly, some governments have openly challenged privacy advocacy on the basis of innuendo - "nothing to hide, nothing to fear". <P>
    The mass collection and matching of personal information on the basis of law enforcement and public revenue is a feature of modern economies. The dilemma facing advocates is that while there is general concern in many countries over this  growing informational canopy, there are few avenues to meet the threats and the challenges of this new technology. Law, by itself, is clearly inadequate. A new consciousness is perhaps a more realistic solution. This means that citizens who have come to accept that information is truly a commodity, might have to become aware of the implications of the general availability and use of this commodity. <P>

<H3>THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA :</H3>
   Support for privacy protection has increased dramatically in the U.S. in recent years. Consumers have joined forces with civil libertarians to oppose the sale of personal information and the misuse of data by the private sector. In the most striking example, more than 30,000 people successfully lobbied against the release of Lotus Marketplace, a CD ROM package containing detailed information and personal buying habits of 120 million American consumers. <P>
    The United States has a long privacy tradition, but current law is inadequate and requires extensive revision. The Privacy Act of 1974 which protects only records held by government agencies, is not adequately enforced. The Privacy Act does not cover records held by the private sector or records held by government agencies on foreign citizens. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 restricts the ability of government agents to wiretap communications, but allows telephone companies to sell records of phone calls to businesses and direct marketing firms. There is no comprehensive protection for medical records, insurance records or employment records in the United States. Court remedies for existing privacy laws are expensive and beyond the reach of most people. State agencies are now also selling personal data. <P>
There is no data protection authority in the United States, nor has a constitutional right of information privacy been established. As a result, there is no coordinated effort within the government to improve privacy protection. There is also no core privacy right established firmly in law. The establishment of a Federal Privacy Board was the cornerstone of legislation introduced by Senator Sam Ervin in 1974. His bill became the Privacy Act, the foundation of privacy protection in the United States. However, strong opposition from the Ford White House led to the demise of the proposed Board before final passage. In its place, a privacy protection study commission was formed. When the Commission completed its study of privacy protection in 1977, the same conclusion was reached. The Commission recommended the creation of the Federal Privacy Board. Fourteen years later, there can be no doubt that the United States needs a Data Protection Board. There is no mechanism to assess the new uses of transactional data. Current privacy safeguards are simply inadequate<P>
    New technologies have also raised concern in the United States. Caller ID is widely opposed, with many states requiring strict safeguards before the service can be offered. The collection of genetic information and the proposal that the Federal Bureau of Investigation should establish a national database has also drawn criticism from privacy advocates, civil libertarians and the medical community. There is growing opposition to the use of the Social Security Number (SSN) as a national identifier. Several states have passed laws to restrict the use of the SSN. Direct marketing remains unregulated, though consumer opposition to the sale of personal information is widespread. <P>

<H3>CANADA</H3>
    A general constitutional right to privacy against the state is emerging though jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada on a Section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which gives protection against unreasonable search and seizure. There are comprehensive data protection laws for government and public agencies at federal level and in only two of the ten provinces, Quebec and Ontario. Credit reporting laws exist in seven provinces. In 1987, Quebec adopted a new charter in its civil code setting general standards and principles of privacy and data protection but it has not yet come into force. <P>
In the last year or so new commissioners  were appointed in all three existing data protection agencies: Bruce Phillips as Privacy Commissioner of Canada, Paul Andr&eacute; Comeau as President of the Commission d'access &aacute; l'information of Quebec, and Tom Wright as Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.<BR>
<BR>
    A disquieting privacy situation is emerging in Quebec that is worth comment. In 1990 a bill was introduced that would in practice have dismantled Quebec's Access to Information and Data Protection Act which was adopted in 1982. On data protection the bill would have permitted the transmission of personal data on any person "capable" of breaking a law. Since any such person has this potential, the many critics of the bill feared it might create a limitless privacy intrusion. Other sections would have suspended the application of the Act for a variety of data banks. In the wake of controversy over the bill, many sections were deferred. However, it appears that some ministers are re-introducing the sections on a piecemeal basis. . For example, a comprehensive new act on health and welfare was adopted and one section removes it from the ambit of the data protection Act and the jurisdiction of the Commission. <P>
    There appears to be a trend toward surveillance that can be traced to 1989 with the adoption of an act permitting intrusive controls over the lives of welfare recipients. Since then, the Health and Welfare minister has been considering the adoption of some form of citizens' ID card. Comprehensive legislation covering the private sector was promised in 1988, and public hearings began last October. The enthusiasm of the government appeared to be somewhat diluted, however, and one minister openly talked about allowing the continuation of self regulation.  The hearings soon after were postponed until the Spring of 1992.<P>
    In 1990 Caller ID was iintroduced in two Canadian cities, and the service is slowly being made available across the country. Blocking is provided on a call by call basis for a cost of .75&#162;. Only services such as women's shelters were given free and universal blocking. This decision was opposed by a large coalition of human rights and consumers associations, shelters and transition homes, women's groups, professional bodies and others. Many instances of breaches of medical and professional confidentiality have since been reported,  and the position is now being challenged before the Federal court on the grounds of infringement of the rights of privacy, equality, and freedom of speech.<P>
    The Federal Department of Transport has suspended plans for mandatory drug testing in the transport industry but there are a growing number of individual employers using drug testing procedures in the workplace. Many public and private employers now impose intrusive - and sometimes degrading - medical investigations before and during employment. Critics are warning that this trend could pave the way for more invasive technologies such as genetic screening.<BR>
<BR>
   There are several experiments on smart cards being conducted or under preparation. One Quebec project envisions the smart card as a portable medical file. Fears have been expressed over the capacity for surveillance. A federal project would give unemployment insurance recipients a card for information  transaction with the bureaucracy and payment transactions (credit and retail direct debit).<BR>

<B>SOUTH AFRICA<BR>
</B><BR>
   Privacy in South Africa is protected by the common law under the broad principles of the actio injuiarum which deals with wrongs involving an intentional and unlawful infringement of a person's personality rights, including the right to privacy. These principles are flexible enough to protect citizens from intrusions, public disclosures of private facts,  being placed in a false light, and having their image and likeness appropriated. The common law, however, is not always sufficient to protect citizens from surveillance by government, security and law enforcement agencies. <P>
    There is no statutory protection of privacy in South Africa, although there is some limited protection in those statutes which require citizens to make certain private disclosures for the purposes of statistics, census or income tax. The most blatant statutory invasion of privacy is the Identification Act of 1986 which requires all citizens to provide a great deal of personal information in order to obtain identity documents. <P>
    The Post Office Act authorises salaried officials to intercept and read the contents of correspondence in certain circumstances e.g. where there is no address on the envelope or the article is suspected of lotteries, sports pools, or obscene or indecent matter, or the interception is necessary in the interests of state security. The latter is the biggest threat to the individual's privacy regarding correspondence because it is not controlled by the courts. Telegrams may also be intercepted on the same basis and certain delegated officials may listen in to telephone conversations. Again, there is no judicial control over wire-tapping procedures in South Africa. This needs to be urgently addressed.<P>
    The right to privacy in South Africa has also been undermined by the wide powers of the police in terms of the Internal Security Act of 1982, the Criminal Procedure Act of 1977 and the Public Safety Act of 1983. Security laws have given the police wide powers to intrude into people's private lives. <P>
    Surveillance in the private sector by persons such as private detectives has been outlawed by the courts. The biggest threat to citizens in the private sector is that of credit bureaux. Most credit bureaux in South Africa would probably allow the subject of an enquiry to inspect his or her file, but usually the former will not disclose the identity of the latter to the subject. This means that not only are subjects unaware that they may inspect their files, but they may also experience difficulty in locating the agency concerned. There is an urgent need for legislation to ensure that consumers are notified that an agency is holding their personal files, informed by any users of a credit agency as to the latest name and address, given the right to inspect, correct and update their files, notified by the agency each time their data is released, and to whom, and given the right to enquire of any credit agency whether it holds a file on them. <P>
    At present there is no proposed legislation concerning privacy in the pipeline, although when a Bill of Rights and new Constitution is negotiated, it is likely to contain an article dealing with privacy. Two versions have been proposed: one by the African National Congress and the other by the South African Law Commission. <P>
    A bill of rights and constitution which enshrines the protection of privacy will provide a sound foundation upon which to introduce legislation to protect citizens in South Africa from unnecessary invasions of privacy and surveillance by both the state and private organisations.     <P>

<B>PANAMA<BR>
</B><BR>
    On December 20, 1990, US Army troops invaded Panama and overthrew the regime of General Manuel Antonio Noriega. Only a few months before, in May 1989, Noriega's army (Fuerzas de defensa) annulled that year's presidential elections, violating Panamanian people's electoral rights. Noriega was the last of the military dictators who governed without respect for human rights. <P>
After the US invasion, the civilian candidates who had won by an overwhelming majority (more than 80 per cent) in the 1989 elections, assumed political power and inaugurated the Democratic Government for National Reconstruction and Reconciliation, headed by  Guillermo Endara.<P>
    With the formation of the new Democratic government, violations of human rights such as freedom of the press and political rights came to a stop. The development of democratic institutions and the separation of the three classical powers was commenced, and continues to this point. <P>
    Nevertheless, Endara's regime has been accused (a year later) of human rights violations such as telephonic espionage against political opponents. A National Attorney General prosecution obtained no results. On the other hand, the National Assembly (Congress) has shown some concern over the existence of a National Security Bureau in the Presidential Office. <P>
Among other accusations are the photographing of demonstrators during the Manifestations. <P>
    There has been progress in human rights in Panama and slow but sustained advances in the judicial systems. There are, however, complaints at all levels over alleged lack of will and honesty in the prosecution of crimes by the former military. And while some of the opposition leaders are claiming an injustice  (that is, the prosecution of Noriega's allies) others are denouncing government persecution.      <P>

<B>HUNGARY</B><P>
    The Hungarian Republic, a former member of the Warsaw Pact, which is no more in existence, is in the state of transition from a totalitarian communist dictatorship to a democratic welfare society. Free parliamentary elections were held in the Spring of 1990 following the introduction of a plural political party system, and a new government was formed by the coalition of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the Christian Democrats, and the Small Holders' Party with the majority of votes in the new Parliament. Another three parties and some independent MPs are in opposition.<P>
Hungary became a full member of the Council of Europe on the 6th November 1990 and signed an agreement with the Commission of the European Communities for Associated Membership in November 1991.<P>
   All these processes called "systems change" requires an almost completely new legislation, especially concerning statutes regulating policy procedures, public administration, basic human and civil rights, as well as laws on privatisation, the newly established and constantly growing private sphere etc i.e. the promotion of the market economy as contrasted with the centrally planned and directed people's economy.<BR>
In this situation it is quite understandable that the Parliament and the Government have given privacy matters a considerably low priority. <BR>
<BR>
    Although the new constitution was promulgated as early as the Autumn of 1989, and amended since then several times, and it declares privacy in general and the right to personal data protection and freedom of information in particular (art 59 and 61) the new laws assuring the exercise of these rights, though ready to be tabled in the Parliament, are still delayed. What is being discussed however, is the possibility of a law on the old state security files (similar to the stasi files in Germany).<BR>
Nevertheless, there is a decision of the Constitutional Court [No 15/1991 (IV 13) AB] declaring as unconstitutional the collection and processing of personal data without specified purposes and for future use at will on the one hand, and the unlimited use of a general and unified personal identification number - introduced in Hungary in the mid 1970s - on the other. This hopefully shall speed up the legislation procedure of certain draft bills. In that respect, the following drafts can be taken into account : Personal and Domicile Registration, Police, National Security, Freedom of Press, Official statistics, and last, but not least, Protection of personal data and access to data of Public Interest.  The latter should be regarded as a DP and FOI bill, very strong, complementing the constitution, to be passed by the Parliament with a qualified (two thirds) majority of votes. When in force, it should serve as a foundation for all other legal instruments and provisions on DP and FOI. Consequently it should be passed before any other such, be it on police files or on data collected for statistics production, to avoid a difficult to handle "filius ante patrem" situation. <BR>
    The draft bill was complete at the end of 1990 because the former government decided in January 1989 to submit it to the Parliament till the deadline just mentioned. The bill still pending takes account of the principles laid down in Convention no. 108 on data protection of the Council of Europe.  and for that reason it is also in harmony with the draft directive on DP of the CEC issued last year. It covers both manual and automated files kept and used by both public and private agencies. The usual rights of individuals - to know about, to inspect, to correct their data etc - are guaranteed, based on the notion of informational self determination which can be limited by the force of law only. A parliamentary Commissioner shall control the implementation of the law and keep a file of the existing data handlings. <P>
    The other side of the coin i.e. freedom of information, as far as data held by public bodies are concerned, are also regulated by the draft, providing for the free access to all data if not protected for being personal or state secret according to the law. The Parliamentary Commissioner shall investigate the complaints in that respect too. <BR>

<B> AUSTRALIA</B><P>
    The most  significant feature of the Australian privacy scene in 1991 has been the continuing expansion of data matching and other forms of data surveillance by the Commonwealth (federal) government. The Data Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 commenced operation. It authorises and requires most Commonwealth benefit-granting agencies (social security, veteran's benefits, student assistance, and housing assistance) to match beneficiary information between themselves and with the taxation department, in an an attempt to reduce 'double-dipping", income  understatement and identity fraud by benefit recipients and taxpayers. The  agencies involved have recently reported to Parliament on the initial  operation of the scheme. <BR>
<BR>
    The Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department is attempting to set up a  Law Enforcement Access Network (LEAN) which will aggregate so-called  'publicly available information" - initially from State land information  systems and from company records, but later from other sources as well  - in  order to provide 'one stop shopping' for government agencies who wish to  trace assets and transactions in which people of interest to them are  involved. Access to LEAN is to be provided to government agencies with  loosely-defined 'law enforcement' responsibilities - including the social  security department as well as more traditional law enforcement agencies.  Access by State government agencies is also envisaged. The government has  authorised LEAN to go ahead without any legislative authority (and  therefore without any Parliamentary scrutiny), because it claims that such  information falls outside the Privacy Act and therefore LEAN does not  breach it. The Australian Privacy Foundation challenged this view in a  complaint to the Privacy Commissioner, but the compliant has not yet been  resolved. The fate of LEAN will be one of the principal privacy issues of  1992. <BR>
<BR>
    Privacy advocates had a significant win to end the year - the defeat of the  'Black Box" proposal. The Commonwealth government had been trying for some  years to require pharmacies to verify on-line with the Health Insurance  Commission (who were responsible for the 'Australia Card' proposal) the eligibility of anyone who was to be supplied pharmaceuticals at a concessional rate. Because they were attempting to prevent non
residents  from obtaining a subsidy available only to Australian residents, the  proposal had the potential for surveillance of the whole community.  Although the legislation to implement the system was passed in June (Health  Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1991), it was made  conditional upon the Auditor-General and the Finance Department verifying  the government's estimated cost
savings. In fact, he showed that the  estimates were patently false, and the government was forced to abandon the  scheme entirely. In a delightful irony, the only part of the legislation  which has survived is that giving the Privacy  Commissioner powers to  regulate the whole of the Medicare information system (health insurance and  pharmaceutical benefits). <P>
    The Commonwealth Privacy Commissioner's role during 1991 has not involved  any major public confrontations with the government. <BR>
<BR>
No Australian State has yet enacted comprehensive legislation. All states have either enacted Freedom of Information legislation, which also provides rights of correction of personal information in government files,  or are in the process of so doing. Beyond that there is confusion. A Bill for an ill-defined "Privacy Tort" was introduced in South Australia but  seems to have been deservedly shelved. In New South Wales a bill to create  criminal offences for trafficking in personal information in government files has been introduced, and it also provides some extensions to the  'privacy ombudsman"  functions of the NSW Privacy Committee. <BR>
 <BR>
The most significant role in exposing invasions of privacy has fallen to the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) which, in a long-running series of public hearings has  revealed an 'information  exchange club" operating both clandestinely and semi-openly between State and Federal public sector agencies, finance and insurance companies, banks, private investigators  and other private sector organisations. In a number  of cases, one government agency would pay for the officers of other government agencies to be corrupted.  The ICAC report on corrupt disclosures is due around March 1992, and  may be the impetus for major reforms in both  NSW and Federal legislation. ICAC has already been far more effective at exposing illegal invasions of privacy than any privacy protection agency has ever been in Australia, and its report may be of interest beyond these  shores. <P>
    In relation to the private sector, national credit reporting legislation which is claimed (by the credit industry) to be the most restrictive in the western world has come into force and will be fully operative in February  1992. The legislation (the Privacy Amendment Act 1990) provides the normal range of individual rights, backed up by both criminal offences and provision for damages. The legislation effectively prevents credit  information from being used for any significant  non-credit purpose. Beyond that, there is as yet, still no significant enforceable privacy law affecting the private sector. The irony  of this is that while our credit  reporting laws may well provide 'adequate protection" in the terms of the European Community draft directive on data protection, the rest of the Australian private sector will be exposed to restrictions on personal data  flows from Europe when the directive comes into force. <P>
    Telecommunications privacy is just starting to become a significant issue. A competitive telecommunications carrier (OPTUS) has been selected, and the  previous monopoly carrier (Telecom / OTC) is to be removed form the reach  of the Privacy ACT. AUSTEL, the telecommunications regulatory body, has started an inquiry into Calling Line Identification, caller ID and other privacy related technological issues. The need for a new legislative structure  for telecommunications privacy is urgent. <BR>
<BR>
The Australian Privacy Foundation, the only non-government organisation in Australia involved exclusively in privacy protection, has continued to play a significant role in raising public awareness of privacy issues, and in  campaigning on specific issues. It played a major role in organising the successful opposition to the pharmaceutical "black-box" and in campaigning for credit reporting legislation. Jim Nolan has recently  succeeded Graham Greenleaf  as Chairman, and Simon Davies has stepped down as APF director in order to concentrate on his work for Privacy International. <P>
    In summary, the Australian position is similar to other comparable  countries. Improvements in data protection laws are occurring in tandem  with significant extensions of data surveillance as a principal toll of both government and business.  The task of finding and installing  appropriate limits on the development of a surveillance society continues  to be frustrating, but is not hopeless. <BR>

NEW ZEALAND<P>
</B>   The following text is taken from a document entitled "The Kiwicard, data matching, and the end of privacy" published in October 1991 by the newly established New Zealand Privacy Foundation.     <BR>
                                                 <BR>
The Unmasking of a plot.<P>
    On the evening of September 11th, 1991, viewers of TV3 watched in amazement as a senior bureaucrat revealed that the Government was in the final stage of planning a secret, high-tech universal ID card. The card would link major Government departments and would have the capacity to track all financial dealings and even geographical movements. The plan was known as "social bank".<P>
The rest is history. Branding the claim as "absolute hysteria", Prime Minister Bolger said no work was proceeding on such a scheme. He was immediately contradicted by the deputy head of Social Welfare, and also by former Prime Minister David Lange, who revealed that work on a "smart card" (a card containing a computer chip) had been going on for four years. <P>
    The news should have come as no surprise. Australian privacy campaigner Simon Davies had been warning New Zealand media since 1989 that the country stood a grave risk of such a move. Countries throughout the world have been moving to such a system. Most, however, have much stronger parliamentary and constitutional safeguards than does New Zealand. <P>
The facts uncovered in recent weeks are these :<P>
1.     The New Zealand Government plans to extend the Kiwi card to all people, not just those on low incomes.<P>
2.     The functions of the Kiwi Card will be extended beyond health benefits so that it will be required for all government benefits, including Social welfare, housing and education.<P>
3.     The card will be required to open and operate a bank account, and will ultimately be demanded by employers (those people who do not produce their card will almost certainly be required to pay the highest tax rate).<P>
4.     The revelations on TV3 indicate that the card will also be used in a "user pays" road toll system.<P>
5.     There are absolutely no limits, safeguards or restrictions on the use of the Kiwicard. It can be demanded by anybody - police, government officials or banks - for any purpose. <P>
6.     The Government plans to introduce a data matching program in which files held by seperate government departments will be matched. This plan is occuring without consultation or justification, and in the face of evidence that such programs are fraught with costs and dangers. <P>
    Why the Kiwi Card and Data Matching are so dangerous.<P>
New Zealand has a political system based almost entirely on trust and good faith.  There is no parliamentary house of review, no enforceable constitution, and no established process of government accountability. When governments in New Zealand propose any measure to monitor or control the population, New Zealanders should demand an exhaustive justification. This simply has not happened. There is no cost benefit justification in the data matching proposal. Remember that when the Government compares all its files on you, it is doing what police could not do unless they had secured a warrant. We are talking here of mass search without warrant. It must not be done unless careful thought has been given to the consequences. <P>
    Perhaps the gravest ramification of the governments proposals is the damage that will be done to the relationship between the citizen and the state. We must remember that in any democratic nation, it is the government that is accountable to the people, not the other way round. Governments that argue on the basis of "nothing to hide nothing to fear" are resorting to a flimsy and dangerous argument. No civilised population <BR>
should be blackmailed into accepting a revenue measure. <BR>
    The recent secret plans have revealed that New Zealand policy is being driven by a small clique of elite bureaucrats. Members of parliament, by and large, have little or no idea about the workings or ramifications of these proposals. Policy is no longer made in the party room. It is made by non-elected people. MPs have less and less influence over their government's policy. <P>
You might believe that  the situation is New Zealand is different. You might believe our government really cherishes Privacy. Wrong. What has been revealed in recent weeks is nothing short of the sabotage of democracy and trust. <P>
    The New Zealand Privacy Foundation is committed to fighting the slow and stealthy intrusion occurring right now in New Zealand. We are not ashamed to make our fears public. We believe that New Zealand without Privacy will be a country without freedom. <P>
<BR>
The Privacy of Information  Bill, 1991<P>
Abridged version of Privacy International's submission to the Parliament of New Zealand.     <P>
1.     Introduction to the Submission<BR>
1.1     Because of the limited time available to Privacy International for analysis of the Bill, this submission is neither detailed nor comprehensive. Instead, we will confine the submission to general points. We would, however, be prepared to present an oral submission to the Committee.<BR>
1.2     Privacy International welcomes the initiative of the New Zealand Government in presenting the Privacy of Information  Bill. It is a much needed and long awaited measure to deal with a complex and urgent set of problems. <BR>
1.3     Notwithstanding the specific concerns set out in this submission, we believe that the Bill satisfies many of the requirements to adequately protect personal privacy in the 1990s. The Bill is generally a positive and practicable initiative which should be warmly received by the people and the Parliament of New Zealand.<BR>
1.4     Although the Bill establishes generally satisfactory mechanisms for Privacy protection, there exist a number of deficiencies and ambiguities, and these will be dealt with in this submission. We are particularly  concerned  by five matters which give rise to concerns about the overall effectiveness of the Bill. Those are <BR>
     1.4.1     The establishment of unique numbering systems,<BR>
     1.4.2     The "Kiwi Card",<BR>
     1.4.3     Data matching programs existing prior to the commencement of the Act, <BR>
     1.4.4     Requirements relating to application for and determination of requests to establish data matching programmes,and <BR>
     1.4.5     The Commissioner's jurisdiction relating to the private sector.<BR>
2.     GENERAL COMMENTS RELATING TO THE BILL<BR>
2.1     Privacy International believes that protections against data surveillance and privacy intrusion should be a key concern to the governments of all countries. These issues are, in our view,  at least as important as protection of other basic human rights or protection of the environment. Privacy legislation should thus be subject to careful consideration and rigorous scrutiny. The purpose of a Privacy Act is to establish safeguards and limitations to activities that would impinge on the privacy and rights of the individual. However, Privacy International is mindful that legislation can also have the unintended effect of legitimating privacy intrusions by establishing a legal basis for the construction of intrusive information programs. The mere existence of legislation is not, in itself, sufficient to satisfy the expectations of a modern, information based society. Nor does the mere existence of legislation provide any  guarantee that privacy violations will be subject to sufficient limitation. In some countries, privacy legislation has been less than successful in limiting the erosion of privacy. Wholesale exemptions provided by legislation, (such as that in IPP 13 (e) of the New Zealand Bill), coupled with the allowance for establishment of non legislative regulations, have weakened the core principles of the Acts of many countries. New Zealand should strive to avoid this example. <BR>
2.2     We believe the New Zealand Bill is fundamentally strong, but is likely to be undermined in time through the establishment of precedent, the extension of regulation, and the application of various exemptions. The Parliament should take these factors into consideration when determining whether adequate safeguards are in place in the legislation<BR>
2.3     Privacy International is aware that the enforcement of criminal law and the pursuit of public revenue are important elements for the proper functioning of society. However we also believe that a community should understand the cost that sometimes applies to the unreasonable or irrational pursuit of these objects. There are many examples of revenue or efficiency initiatives which have negative elements that outweigh the benefits. In the Pacific region, the  massive 1987 protest against the proposed Australia Card is the most well known example of controversy over this balance of interests. In such countries as the Netherlands and West Germany, the general population has outrightly rejected some government information collection schemes that breached the fundamental balance of public interest. The recent proliferation of information technology based schemes within government prompts the conclusion that there is no limit to the the extent of measures intended to pursue law enforcement and revenue. It follows that there is no limit to the possible spectrum of intrusions on privacy. Safeguards must be thoughtfully entrenched in the legislation and subject to public scrutiny.<BR>
2.4  The establishment of Information Privacy Principles in the Privacy laws of various countries is an attempt to create a benchmark to assist in determining where to draw the line at intrusion on personal privacy. In Australia, these principles are embodied in the Privacy Act 1988.  The New Zealand Bill embodies similar principles. The Australian Act was passed in an environment of suspicion and concern about the proliferation of information within government, and the degree of power exercised by bureaucrats. However, because of broad exemptions and limits to the practicability of the principles, privacy laws are, as much as anything,  instruments of good faith. It is our view that the New Zealand Government should view the Privacy of Information Bill not merely as a legal instrument, but also as an ethical  guide to the proper and acceptable limits of information  collection and use. The technical application of the Information Privacy Principles is no guarantee that in every case the balance of public interest will be served. <BR>
2.5      Part IX of the Bill dealing with data matching is inadequate. We are concerned that justification for data matching tends to gravitate to a cost benefit rationale, with other values gradually being excluded. We believe a requirement for the presentation of a "Social Impact Statement" by the applicant agencies might redress some of the problems found in other countries. Such an analysis would assist in the process of determining public interest and would also increase an agencies sensitivity about the range of impacts of information proposals. In addition, applicant agencies should be required to provide detailed technical and program specifications, details of appeal and administrative processes, an assessment of the impact of the program on the agency itself, and a synopsis of procedures for assessment of the impact of the programs. Applicant agencies should also provide an understanding of the algorithms (the logic and basis) of the program. The procedures for dealing with applications should be subject to a degree of public scrutiny.<BR>
2.6     The Bill is unclear about requirements relating to existing data matching programs. We believe the first task of the Commissioner should be to conduct a full National Audit of New Zealand Information systems, with a requirement that all existing data matching systems apply under Part IX of the Act within ninety days of notification by the Commissioner. <BR>
2.7     Part X of the Bill is entirely unacceptable. The establishment of regulations to govern the setting up of unique identifiers is entirely inappropriate. Unique identifiers are a core concern for privacy protection, and any establishment of such systems should be subject to legislation. <BR>
2.8     Privacy International is deeply concerned about the implications in the establishment of the "Kiwi Card" and we believe this initiative should be subject to scrutiny by a Select Committee of Parliament. Following extensive public debate and consultation, any such system should then be established within law and be subject to strict guidelines and limitations. <BR>
3.     THE EXTENT OF CORRUPT AND ILLEGAL DEALINGS WITH CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION : THE AUSTRALIAN EXPERIENCE<BR>
3.1     Many of our comments and recommendations in this submission are made in the light  of the extraordinary evidence revealed during a recent Independent Commission Against Corruption hearing in New South Wales. This inquiry (Operation Tamba) investigated the extent of the illegal sale and trade of personal information held by private organisations and government departments, especially the Police and the Roads and Traffic Authority. In its submission to the inquiry, the Australian Privacy Foundation expressed its deep concern at the magnitude of admissions of such illegal activities. Some bureaucrats had admitted to earning tens of thousands of dollars selling personal information on departmental files. Police had admitted routinely trading information with private investigators, banks, the finance industry and insurance companies.   While the Foundation had feared that disclosure of personal information was widespread, the extent of such practices could not have been guessed at.  Operation TAMBA is without doubt the most wide-ranging inquiry ever undertaken in Australia into the illegal trade in official information.  It has established beyond question that an immediate comprehensive response to such trade is necessary.<BR>
3.2     It has become abundantly clear that there is widespread ignorance both in the private and public sector, of the requirements relating to confidentiality of personal information.  Coupled with what appears to be large scale institutionalised corruption, people who are the subject of this information are left with grossly ineffective and inadequate privacy protections.. At the time of writing, Australia and New Zealand are equally vulnerable to this corruption.<BR>
3.3     The evidence uncovered by Operation TAMBA is relevant to other western nations. Careful consideration must be gives as to whether conditions in similar organisations in other countries are significantly different to those existing in New South Wales. We believe there must be intelligent debate as to whether New Zealand has the same level of endemic and epidemic corruption within some organisations. We believe there are no special conditions existing in New Zealand that would provide immunity from the type and extent of corruption existing in Australia.                  <BR>
3.4     Operation TAMBA has revealed a state of affairs in New South Wales which may well exist in New Zealand. Issues raised in evidence to the inquiry reveal the following :<BR>
     3.4.1     There is a widespread attitude of casualness in respecting personal and      confidential information.  No doubt an explanation for this is the belief that information      held by government authorities is squarely in the public domain.  Over recent decades many police and NSW bureaucrats seem to have formulated a self-serving and unacceptable definition of 'publicly available' information.<BR>
     3.4.2      A widespread ignorance of the legal regulations relating to the management of personal information has been revealed through numerous admissions both by      members of the legal profession and private/mercantile agents.  Two and a half years after the enactment of Information Privacy Principles ('IPPs') in Commonwealth legislation, the rationale and contents of the Principles appear to have remained largely the domain of esoteric administrative law.  The fact that the NSW Crimes Act did not respond to computerisation of personal records until July 1989 has not helped in this respect.  The one official watchdog of the privacy of the people of the State, the NSW Privacy Committee has been forced to adopt a predominantly reactive approach to these issues, through lack of resources and legal power to enforce its guidelines;.<BR>
     3.4.3     We are forced to conclude because of  the magnitude of admissions by      witnesses that there are pockets of institutionalised corruption within the NSW Public Service.  The absence of effective legal regulation and the ready access to personal information facilitates and promotes such corruption.  It appears that demand for such information rises with its ease of availability.<BR>
     3.4.4     A major factor in the corruption uncovered by ICAC is the lax or virtually non-existent security procedures relating to sensitive personal information.  The rationale embodied in such procedures as exist seems to go unrecognised by many members of government instrumentalities and law enforcement authorities.  It is clear that      security procedures are rarely scrutinised or subject to audits (external or internal).  This represents a major shortcoming on the part of administrators, given the relative      ease of imposition of multiple levels of security clearance. Security protocols have failed to take advantage of the capabilities afforded by modern technologies.<BR>
     3.4.5     The collection of personal information by law enforcement authorities may      have exceeded its acceptable bounds.  It is difficult to suggest reasons for 6.5 million accesses by police to the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) database in one year aand in excess of 100,000 number-to-name requests to Telecom by police in the same      period.  In respect of police inquiries of the RTA database there may well be a breach of the Commonwealth Crimes Act (section 76D) if the inquiry is for an unauthorised purpose, as the access is likely to be by way of a 'Commonwealth facility' (ie. Telecom phone line). These issues go to the heart of the effectiveness of the IPPs as a means of limiting the volume of information collected. <BR>
4.     THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEM<BR>
4.1     The corruption uncovered throughout Operation TAMBA has prospered through recent years because of an environment of carelessness and managerial arrogance  within the  public service. A general lack of accountability and a lax attitude to consultation and communication within departments gives rise to ignorance and lack of respect to procedures and laws. Some departmental staff cannot comprehend the significance of their actions with regard to the sale and trading of personal information.<BR>
4.2     The state of legislation accounts for only a portion of the problem. The trade in personal information has continued - perhaps even expanded - despite the existence since 1989 of specific penalties in the NSW Crimes Act. The responsibility for this state of affairs rests to a large extent with departmental heads who have consistently failed to respond to the need for education. The extent of awareness within the NSW Government appears to be extremely poor when compared with awareness of information privacy requirements at Federal level. <BR>
4.3     One of the most valuable effects of legislation is its impact on community attitudes. The existence of privacy laws in New Zealand would go a long way toward bringing awareness of the need for stringent protection of confidential information. But the revelations of Operation TAMBA have established that the existence of law is, by itself, not a sufficient force. The establishment of a pro-active jurisdiction is necessary to focus public attention on particular problems and issues. <P>
5      THE ROLE OF A PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION COMMISSIONER<BR>
5.1     Based on the experience of Australia and some other western countries such as Canada and Germany, Privacy International believes that a New Zealand Privacy and Data Protection Commissioner should be as much an advocate as a regulator. Certainly, if the Australian Commonwealth jurisdiction has been used as a model for the development of New Zealand legislation, a New Zealand Commissioner should aim to be more of a public advocate for privacy protection than the Australian Commissioner has been to date. The Bill should specify expectations in this regard. The pace of development of information technology applications and the seductive nature of the technology require a strong and well resourced public advocate. <BR>
6.     RECOMMENDATIONS<BR>
Our specific submissions follow:<P>
<BR>
6.1     Amendments to Information Privacy Principles :<BR>
     6.1.1     IPP 1.     We suggest a clause (c) specifying that an agency wishing to collect information must have inquired into the desirability, alternative options, and public interest in such an activity. The requirement that information collection must be "necessary for" an agency is an impractical limitation on the general collection of information. In Australia, that justification has been contentious, and in recent times has been strengthened by amendments to Health legislation requiring that one information collection scheme be subject to an options and cost benefit report presented to parliament prior to the commencement of the information scheme.<BR>
     6.1.2     IPP 5     The following should be included in  the section :<BR>
(c)     stored for specific, explicit, and lawful purposes and used in a way consistent with those purposes;<BR>
(d)     adequate relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is stored;<BR>
(e)     processed fairly and lawfully,<BR>
     6.1.3     IPP 6     We suggest that (1) of IPP 5 of the Australian Privacy Act be included here. Additionally, this IPP should ensure that record keepers are required to specify whether the record keeper has possession or control of such records relating to the person.<BR>
     6.1.4     Nature of information. We submit that  perhaps through an additional IPP or amending an existing IPP, limitations be placed on use and disclosure of ethnic or racial origin political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and health or sexual life without the express written consent, freely given, of the individual concerned.<BR>
 6.2      Part IX of the Bill dealing with data matching is inadequate. Fundamental objections to data matching can reasonably be raised on the grounds that data matching programs tend to (a) operate on an assumption of guilt, (b) have uncertain outcomes, (c) be based on a set of incorrect assumptions, and (d) allow rights of search which would be illegal with regard to physical property or privately held files. We are concerned that justification for data matching tends to gravitate to a cost benefit rationale, with other values gradually being excluded. We believe a requirement for the presentation of a "Social Impact Statement" by the applicant agencies might redress some of the problems found in other countries. Such an analysis would assist in the process of determining public interest and would also increase an agency's sensitivity about the range of impacts of information proposals.  In addition, applicant agencies should be required to provide detailed technical and program specifications, details of appeal and administrative processes, an assessment of the impact of the program on the agency itself, and a synopsis of procedures for assessment of the impact of the programs. The procedures for dealing with applications should be subject to a degree of public scrutiny.<BR>
6.3     The Bill is unclear about requirements relating to existing data matching programs. We believe the first task of the Commissioner should be to conduct a full National  Audit of New Zealand Information systems, with a requirement that all existing data matching systems apply under Part IX of the Act within ninety days of notification by the Commissioner. <BR>
6.4     Part X of the Bill is entirely unacceptable. The establishment of regulations to govern the setting up of unique identifiers is entirely inappropriate. Unique identifiers are a core concern for privacy protection, and any establishment of such systems should be subject to legislation. <BR>
6.5     Privacy International is deeply concerned about the implications in the establishment of the "Kiwi Card" and we believe this initiative should be subject to scrutiny by a Select Committee of Parliament. After extensive public debate and consultation, any such system should then be established within law and be subject to strict guidelines and limitations.  The Parliament should be aware of the following major risks associated with identification cards :<BR>
     6.5.1     The risk that the card will be subject to a range of unforseen applications (function creep)<BR>
     6.5.2     The danger of the card becoming a general and unofficial identification document demanded by a variety of agencies and officials;<BR>
     6.5.3     Change in the nature of the relationship between citizen and the state if the card develops into a more general facility;<BR>
     6.5.4     Problems relating to lost, damaged or stolen cards (which may account for up to ten per cent of cards each year);<BR>
     6.5.5     The creation of an underclass of people who for a variety of reasons are unwilling or unable to obtain the card (and who, therefore, may be denied services etc)<BR>
6.6     Private sector uses of personal data should be regulated by sectoral Codes of Conduct, drawn up by the Privacy  Commissioner where authorised by the Act or by Parliamentary resolution, and subject to parliamentary disallowance. Where such Codes exist, compliance with them should be mandatory under the Act.;<BR>
6.7     Any aspect of privacy which is not regulated by mandatory IPPs or Codes should be subject to the  'ombudsman-style' powers of investigation and recommendation similar to those possessed by the  NSW Privacy Committee. This involves grafting the NSW Privacy Committee model onto the New Zealand Privacy Act model, in order to provide comprehensive but flexible privacy and data protection legislation.<BR>
6.8     Offences should be created such as those in sections 1316, 1317 and 1318 of the Australian Social Security Act 1991 relating to the solicitation, disclosure and offering of confidential information.;<BR>
6.9     That consideration be given by Parliament for Regulation of privacy intrusive practices which might not be regarded as 'data protection' issues, such as physical surveillance, telecommunication interception and drug-testing.;<BR>
6.10     Specific monitoring and approval procedures for any proposed data-matching programs, not just an obligation to notify the Commissioner.;<BR>
6.11     A requirement on agencies to provide comprehensive information on request concerning the uses to which information is put, and the various information pathways within government. An adjunct to this should be a requirement to publish an intelligible register of personal information, specifying precisely the uses to which the information is put. A vivid example of the Commonwealth Personal Information Digest's shortcomings is class 118, dealing with occurrence sheets, of the Australian Federal Police's 1989 entry, which shows that personal information of the most sensitive nature may be held on 2 million Australians, but gives an extremely limited indication of its use.. Such a directory is specified in s.20 of the New Zealand Bill, but would appear to be entirely inadequate as a guideline for a useful and instructive directory of information. .Section 20 should specify that the directory will describe paths of information flow between agencies.<BR>
6.12     Regulation of trans-border flows of data both within Australia and to overseas destinations should be dealt with specifically in the Bill.<BR>
6.13     We believe that funding of the Commissioner should be by way of direct appropriation from consolidated revenue.  It is vital that the Commissioner be entirely independent, and not be responsible to a Minister.  Rather, the Commissioner should report to the Speaker of the Parliament.  Additionally we recommend that a Joint  Parliamentary Committee have oversight of the Commissioner's activities.<BR>
6.14     A Nation-wide personal information audit be should be immediately established.  This would involve an analysis of the magnitude, nature and extent of personal information held within the public sector.  Important elements of this audit might be:<BR>
*     the extent of personal information databases; <BR>
*     the flow of information between different arms of the New Zealand administration (including law enforcement authorities), between public and private sectors,  and between New Zealand and overseas; <BR>
*     the relevance and necessity of the information held by the various agencies; <BR>
*     the availability and use of publicly available records containing personal information;<BR>
*     the security protocols and practices employed in respect of the collection and disclosure of personal information and; <BR>
*     general compliance with existing legislation  regulating such matters.<BR>
It is suggested that the audit would be carried out in a relatively short time-frame (approximately 3 months) by a small team of specialist consultants.  The object of the audit would not be to produce detailed findings. Rather, it is envisaged that a 'snapshot' of the holdings of and practices relating to personal information be obtained.<BR>
6.15     That a special budgetary allocation be made to enable the Commissioner to embark on a three year extensive education program.  The targets of this program should be members of the legal profession, members of the police and public service, and private inquiry and mercantile agents.<BR>
6.16     Section 4(b) of the Bill should specify the nature and categories of Publicly Available Information.  There exists a division of legal opinion in Australia as to whether, for example, certain applications of PAI should be disallowed under the Privacy Act, and whether files containing some PAI are then considered to be, in their entirety, within the public domain.  Additionally, it has been argued that IPPs should apply to Publicly Available Information. (particularly IPPs relating to collection and use).<BR>
6.17     Section 12(j) of the Bill should be amended to provide the Commissioner with the power of audit without request from the agency concerned<BR>
6.18     Section 25 of the Bill should be amended so that the review is conducted by a Select Committee of the Parliament.<BR>
6.19     Section 78, specifying that investigations shall be conducted in private, is a cause for some concern, particularly where matters of public interest are being considered. We believe the processes of the Commissioner should be subject to transparency and should therefore be subject to public scrutiny. There should be some debate by the Select Committee as to where the acceptable line of transparency should fall.<BR>
6.20     The proceedings of the Privacy Commissioner should embrace formality. The informal procedures adopted by some Privacy Commissioners tend to provide advantage in favour of agencies. <BR>
6.21     The Bill should provide that in matters of public interest determination, privacy and other advocates with a specific interest should have a right to appear before the Commissioner. Section 78 should be amended accordingly.<P>

<CENTER><H1>ADVANCED SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE</H1><p>
<H3>4 September 1995</H3> <p>
Copenhagen, Denmark<p>
<p>
<b><H2>Conference Summary</H2></b><p></CENTER>


<b>Introduction</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>On September 4, 1995, 70 individuals from around the world met in
Copenhagen, Denmark for the Advanced Surveillance Technology Conference.
Participants came from over a dozen countries and included leading
technologists, academics, public interest advocates, government officials,
media, and industry representatives. The purpose of the conference was to
discuss new technologies that affect personal privacy.  Participants discussed
closed circuit tv, id cards, computer matching,  computer networks and the
Internet, and encryption. They also discussed possible solutions including
technologies of privacy, industry standards and laws.<p>
<p>
<b>Fusing Flesh and Machine  </b><p>
<b></b><i>Simon Davies, Director General of Privacy International, London,
UK</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>A number of key technological and political trends are converging to
facilitate the creation of Total Surveillance Societies. At the forefront of
these trends is the push for perfect identification of individuals.  <p>
Four factors facilitate that evolution; (1) the development of technical means,
(2) the evolution of political will, (3) the existence of legal mandates, and
(4) the formulation of common standards.  Their subtle interplay slowly
dissolves privacy.<p>
The process requires five steps: (1) deconstruction of the right to privacy,
(2) reconstruction and expansion of a notion of public interest, (3) creation
of "stakeholders", (4) evolution of partnerships, and (5) voluntariness.<p>
The individual right to privacy is first characterized as not fitting in the
technological discourse; it is an unstable, undefinable notion with political
or philosophical overtones.  Privacy is characterized as a selfish concept, to
be done away with. It is gradually replaced by the notion of "data protection",
which is much more manageable.<p>
It then becomes an easy matter to redefine public interest as requiring
surveillance.  United Kingdom authorities plan to install closed circuit
television surveillance in the public areas of over two hundred towns and
municipalities, with the ostensible aim to reduce criminality.  The creation of
DNA databases can also be seen as a way to further the public interest both on
the grounds of public health and of the ability to identify criminals.<p>
The process thereby multiplies stakeholders in surveillance patterns: for
instance, the development of health data networks is promoted on the basis of
public interest and brings the support of the health care community to
surveillance.<p>
Odd partnerships thus emerge.  The merging of public and private sectors, the
development of outsourcing and the apparition of the "profit center" mentality
even in the midst of traditionally  "public sector" activities amplify the
circulation of data.  Already, a quantity of British tax and police data is
held and managed in the United States.  Therefore, everybody has a stake in
obtaining, managing and accessing more information.<p>
All that remains to be done is to circumvent legislation regarding privacy.  It
is easily done through voluntariness: data subjects are invited to provide
information on a voluntary basis.  In the UK, for instance, entire populations
are "invited" to volunteer a sample for DNA testing in relation to major
crimes;  if they won't, they will automatically be considered to be a suspect
and then compulsory tested.  The fact that many privacy laws are based on
principles or mechanisms which have not aged well makes them even easier to
bypass.<p>
Surveillance therefore appears to have a bright future.  It is evolving at a
rapid pace.  As identity cards are fast appearing to be based on a hopeless
technology (Australian banking identity cards were found to be massively forged
in Singapore a month after their introduction), biometrics are being seen as
the identification method with a future. Experiments are already under way
which may, for instance, lead to the use of hand geometry as the identifying
feature in passports, a project in which airlines and various countries show
growing interest.  The use of such passports, which might be issued by the
airlines, would remain voluntary, but various pressures would strongly
encourage passengers to adopt them.<p>
To make the picture darker still, surveillance activities are actively
outsourced to countries where technology-peddling has become a national
specialty.  Things are sure to get worse.<p>
<p>
<b>New Surveillance Technologies and Sub-State Conflict Control  </b><p>
<b></b><i>Steve Wright, Director, Omega Foundation, Manchester, UK</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>We are watching the development of technological fixes to social and
political problems, a trend taking hold in a growing number of countries.  This
phenomenon has primary and obvious effects, but it also has secondary  and
tertiary consequences, which are more important and more powerful than the
intended effects.<p>
The technology takes multiple forms, from "intelligent" fences to the
capability already developed by British Telecom to switch a phone line on from
the switching center and listen in to what is happening in the vicinity of the
phone (System X);  BT also exports that technology.  Biometric systems will
structure the next wave of surveillance methods.<p>
Such technology is often developed in a military context: the Northern Ireland
situation was  a remarkable nursery for new surveillance methods.  It is  used
for policy purposes.  That trend is likely to develop in the United Kingdom,
for instance, where authorities with a long experience in the field of
surveillance, such as MI5, are increasingly looking for a new mission in the
area of police activities.<p>
There is both a demand pull for repression technology and a technological push:
the technology itself spurs the development of surveillance.  Unwanted
surveillance facilities are often built in systems and, once installed, tend to
be used.<p>
Other factors are also at play and even the basic definition of "subversion"
has evolved in British law: from the "overthrow of government by unlawful
means", a fairly restricted concept, it has come to include anything which
"undermines society".  It is therefore not surprising that the fight against
subversion has brought about the massive presence of cameras wherever a
manifestation occurs, with the accompanying chilling effect on expression and
protests.  We are moving from the concept of a person as a citizen of a
community to the notion of a data subject, which makes exclusion easier.<p>
Technological developments related to repression also occur in fields other
that surveillance: much attention has been lent in recent years to so-called
non-lethal weapons, for instance.<p>
What can be done to counter the development of repression technologies in a
context where any one big scare may come to justify surveillance, as that case
where a shopping centre's cameras made possible the identification of the
murderers of a child in Liverpool?  Legislation is  a very primitive tool and
the economy tends to take precedence over human rights: the surveillance
cameras installed at Tienanmen Square were built by an American multinational.
Moreover, it is necessary to control the growth and export of hardware,
software, and liveware.<p>
<p>
<b>European Data Protection: Against the Internet?</b> <p>
<i>Frank Koch, attorney-at-law in Muchen, Federal Republic of Germany</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>The Internet is the paradigm of an open, interconnected and worldwide
set of information nets. There is no centralized agency, organization or
whatever institution controlling the net. You can secure your own system by
building a firewall around it but there is no firewall around the whole
Internet or even around parts of it, especially not around the territory of the
European Union (EU). <p>
Privacy exists on the Internet.  That is not to say no privacy problem exists
on the Net.  In particular, transborder data flows on the Net from European
Union countries to the rest of the world will be complicated by the adoption of
the recent Directive. <p>
Personal data may not be freely transferred worldwide through the Internet, at
least not crossing EU borders. Unlimited access to and disclosure of personal
data is unlawful. As a system operator within the EU you may transfer personal
data to recipients outside the EU borders if<p>
(a) the recipient of these data has designated a representative in the Member
State from where you want to start the data transfer and<p>
(b) you can ensure that the data protection legislation in the recipient state
is equivalent to that in your Member State and<p>
(c) you can make sure that nobody unidentified or not entitled to do so is able
to get access to the part of your system where personal data are stored or can
benefit from personal data disclosed to him and<p>
(d) you have informed the data subject (from whom you store personal data) of
the recipients of these data and the rights the data subject has to access the
system of the recipient and to demand reatification of his data if necessary
and<p>
(e) you find out in what way the recipient uses the data during what time, what
security measurements have been implemented by the recipient and whether there
is a second recipient as final destination to whom apply rules (a) - (e) of
course.<p>
All these requirements must be fulfiled before starting the transfer operation.
In that case and under those tightly defined conditions you may use the
Internet for transferring personal data but even then at the risk of being
liable in case you did not find out the country of final destination or cannot
prove that you are not responsible for an event causing damage to the data
subject. <p>

<i></i><b>Regulation and Codes of Practice</b> <p>
<i>Stephanie Perrin, Special Policy Advisor at Industry Canada</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Under the aegis of the Canadian Standards Association, a draft privacy
code has been prepared, primarily for use by the private sector.  The CSA
effort sets out specific standards that companies could adopt to show their
custmoers that they are good corporate citizens.<p>
Impressed with the work of the CSA privacy committee, the Canadian Information
Highway Advisory Council recommended that the application of any such code or
standard should be reinforced by framework legislation.  They also recommended
that the Canadian Standards Association and other standards bodies invite the
International Standards Organization develop a similar data protection standard
which could be related to quality management standards such as the ISO 9000
series.<p>
<p>
<b>Enforcing Privacy through Surveillance?</b> <p>
<i>Malcolm Norris,Data Protection Registrar of the Isle of Man</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>The protection of privacy over the Internet is going to be increasingly
difficult.  Life on the net has been fairly civilized up to now, due to the
background of most of its pioneers.  However, its popularity is increasing and
it is highly international: it is therefore very difficult to control.
Monitoring everything on the Net would require a police state and banning it
totally is somewhat unrealistic.  Even border controls are not possible.<p>
In such a context, what happens if part of a Net communication between someone
on the Isle of Man and someone in the United States is intercepted in the US or
is found to be illegal under US law?  Would European law apply to the
interception, would US law apply to the Manx resident?<p>
We want to protect individuals' privacy and see it as paramount, but it is
illusory to think that an international agreement could be struck on that
topic:  European countries took years to adopt the Directive regarding data
protection.  It would be even longer to get other countries to jump on the
train, as countries which were occupied (such as most of Europe during World
War II) are more sensitive to the importance of privacy.<p>
Internet users must therefore recognize that there is basically nothing private
on the Internet and that any communication is susceptible of being intercepted.
It is therefore up to them to use encryption to protect their privacy.<p>
Although law has not quite kept up with technology, all is not lost.  Tools
such as the European Convention on Human Rights can be used to protect privacy
and various interested parties are formulating new ideas.<p>

<i></i><b>Perfect Surveillance and Transportation </b><p>
<b></b><i>Philip E. Agre, assistant professor of communication at the
University of California, San Diego.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Many countries around the world are developing computer and
communications systems to monitor and mange road traffic.  This is variously
known as Intelligent Transportation Systems or Transport Telemantics.<p>
Various systems are already in place or being tested.  For instance, some car
rental companies have started to put global positioning systems in their cars
so as to indicate to the driver the best route to get to his destination.
Global positioning systems also have an impact on workplace privacy in
professions such as trucking, since they allow for the tracking in real time of
any vehicle's position.<p>
Intelligent transport systems are used in various contexts.  They support
integrated logistics and help to manage supply chains such as those involved in
the shipping of goods.  They allow for regulatory automation. They also
facilitate the implementation of an electronic payment infrastructure.  One
potential application is in toll collection, where the system can automatically
adjust the tolls at peak hours, a concept called congestion pricing.<p>
Organizations supporting the implementation of such systems include state and
regional transportation authorities, which have little experience with the
responsibilities that come with handling large amounts of personal information.
Unfortunately US courts have not recognized a legitimate expectation of privacy
on a highway, and this has hindered the development of a notion of a privacy
interest in this area.  Nonetheless, information gathered electronically about
individuals' movements is virtually certain to be abused.  As a result, the
only practical approach to protecting highway privacy is probably to ensure
that the systems are designed to be anonymous. This is eminently feasible, for
example using digital cash for toll collection.  It is crucial, though, that
such decisions be made now, while the basic architecture of the systems is
still evolving, so that bad decisions do not become irreversible later.<p>
The root of the problem lies in the existing methods of computer system design,
whose fundamental premise is the systematic tracking and representation of
human activities.  The point is not just that the activities are "followed" or
"watched"; they must also be actively reorganized and instrumented in order to
make tracking technically possible.  In such a system, privacy protection
techniques tend to be limited to easily subverted policies and software
restrictions on the movements of data once it is collected.  Although the
conventional design methods are frequently taken for granted, they have their
historical roots in industrial motion study. But alternatives do exist,
starting with concepts based on cryptography that deliver adequate system
functionality without ever capturing clients' identities in a centralized
database.  Adequate protection of privacy is thus possible, but it requires
more than a review of regulation: it requires the replacement of the metaphor
behind the system's design.  Intelligent transportation is an excellent arena
in which to demonstrate these emerging concepts.  It is also a crucially
important arena, given the immense harm to civil liberties that could result
from a chilling of the freedom to travel and associate.<p>

<i></i><b>Closed Circuit Television and the Policing of Public Morals</b> <p>
<i>Simon Davies</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>The United Kingdom is the most advanced country in the world when it
comes to the implementation of closed circuit television (CCTV) an indirect
consequence of football hooliganism.  The Football Trust gave a grant to
football grounds and to police forces in 1985 to begin implementing
surveillance cameras in and around stadiums.  The initiative snowballed, and
more than one hundred British towns and cities now have complete and integrated
CCTV surveillance systems covering public spaces.  [[sterling]]170 million were
spent in 1994 to implement CCTV and 90 percent of British towns already have
systems or are in the process of implementing them.<p>
Such systems were implemented with a view to stopping serious offenses such as
assault, car theft, and bag snatching.  In fact, they mostly reveal small
infractions and misdemeanors such as urinating in public (even at night,
infrared cameras are able to detect such antisocial behavior) or under-age
drinking or smoking.<p>
These systems are, in essence, military style technology, and their security is
fairly high.  The location of control centers is not disclosed, due to the fact
that one [mistakenly identified] center was the object of a riot in Newcastle
some years ago. Cameras are now protected by bulletproof cases.  Some advanced
systems are so designed that if one camera is disabled, the nearest cameras
will automatically point in its direction to establish what has happened.<p>
The most advanced systems include an array of features.  The zoom is powerful
enough to read a cigarette brand on a pack at 100 yards. Many systems have
movement detection, tracking and infrared. Cameras are also getting smaller:
admittedly less versatile ones (for the time at least) can be found in phone
booths, cash machines, buses and trains, chocolate dispensers, taxis, hotel and
hospital rooms and lifts or on police helmets.  We have come to a point where
one should expect to be photographed: cameras and other bugs are to the point
of becoming ordinary features of household objects.<p>
<p>
<b>Techo-Policing: from Specialization to Common Use </b><p>
<b></b><i>Detlef Nogala, University of Hamburg, Federal Republic of
Germany</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Police work is changing.  We are evolving towards techno-policing with a
tendency to the application of military technology.  The technology allows for
surveillance and detection (including automatic gunshot location), but also for
identification, access to information and processing, communications and better
mobility.  It also supports novel forms of intervention.<p>
The technology is far from being perfect.  Automatic fingerprint ID systems are
out of fashion; identification through facial thermography, which considers
around 65,000 points in a person's face, is apparently extremely accurate --
but is extremely easy to fool by taking some alcohol and thereby inducing
dilation of blood vessels.<p>
There is a growing tendency towards policing by information, using the social
infrastructure in a panoptical and very intrusive fashion.  In such a context,
law is not an appropriate defense mechanism:  what the police can do is simply
legalized.  There are, however, political resistances against that evolution
and technology is expensive, which may somewhat slow its progression.<p>
<p>
<i>More information on techno-policing is available at

<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Encryption and the Threat of Universal Surveillance of the Net </b><p>
<b></b><i>David Banisar,  policy analyst, Electronic Privacy Information
Center, Washington, DC</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Cryptography is essential for protecting privacy in the digital world.
Email can be easily intercepted and modified with no ability to verify.
Cryptography can protect the confidentiality of communications. It can also
authenticate that a message is from a particular user and has not been tampered
with.<p>
Although powerful cryptographic tools are available, there are political
obstacles to their use from the law enforcement and intelligence communities
who wish to maintain their surveillance capabilities. Pakistan has forced
Motorola to provide a capability to intercept communications going over the
network the company installed in that country.<p>
The US Clipper chip controversy is well known.   Less well known is advanced
smart card technology using key escrow going under the name Fortezza
(previously Tessera) is to be integrated in the Department of Defense Messaging
System and various commercial systems.  Commercial key escrow agents in the US
will have to provide the government access to the keys and the key length is
limited.  At the same time, export control policies make it difficult to export
US cryptographic systems.<p>
US government documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act show
that it is the government's desire that cryptographic systems which do not
allow for law enforcement agencies to perform real-time decryption should be
forbidden.<p>
One emerging area of controversy is digital cash of which cryptography is an
essential tool.  There are several different styles of digital cash which
provide different levels of protection.  The most privacy protective are
systems which provide for real anonymity, such as the Digicash system.  A
second type, provides pseudo-anonymous transactions, which do not identify the
person in an obvious manner but have transactions trails built into the system.
An example of this is the Mondex system. Finally, there are a number of system
which operate similar to credit cards which do not provide any type of
anonymous transactions, such as First Virtual.<p>

<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Some Positive Aspects of Privacy Law </b><p>
<b></b><i>Blair Stewart, Office of  the Privacy Commissioner, New Zealand</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>New Zealand adopted a Privacy Protection Act in 1993 which covers both
the public and the private sector.   The legislation is one of the most
advanced in the world, along with that adopted in Quebec and is based on the
OECD guidelines, European data protection laws and the Australian Privacy
Act.<p>
 The Privacy Act contains 12 information privacy principles governing the
collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information, however the
information is held. It also has a principle dealing with unique identifiers
and contains individual access and correction rights.  There are limited
exceptions for Parliamentary and media activities.  <p>
The Privacy Commissioner has jurisdiction over data matching, collection, use
or disclosure of personal information; when a complaint cannot be settled, it
is transferred to a tribunal.  Currently, the commission is reviewing such
issues as DNA databases, drug testing and  codes of practice for the police.<p>
Clearly a Privacy Commissioner cannot alone adequately prevent moves toward a
surveillance society. To do that we require a well informed and more vocal
public. We also require Government administrators and lawmakers to be better
informed on privacy issues. We also require business to better consider fair
information practices. All of these ingredients are necessary. However, a
comprehensive privacy law is arguably a very good start in protecting
individuals from intrusive surveillance and other privacy dangers. <p>

<h2> <P ALIGN=CENTER>Appendix to Recommendation No R. (95) 13
<P>
<center>concerning problems of criminal procedure law<BR>
connected with information technology</center></h2>
</P>

<H3>I. Search and seizure</H3>

1. The legal distinction between searching computers systems and siezing data stored therein and intercepting data in the course of transmission should be clearly delineated and applied.
<P>
2. Criminal procedure laws should permit investigating authorities to search computer systems and seize data under similar conditions as under traditional powers of search and seizure. The person in charge of the system should be informed that the system has been searched and of the kind of data that has been siezed. The legal remedies that are provided for in general against search and seizure should be equally applicable in case of search in computer systems and in case of seizure of data therein.
<P>
3. During execution of a search, investigating authorities should have the power, subject to appropriate safeguards, to extend the search of other computer systems within their jurisdiction which are connected by menas of a network and seize the data therein, provided immediate action is required.
<P>
4. Where automatically processed data is functionally equivalent to a traditional document, provisions in the criminal procedure law relating to search and seizure of documents should apply equally to it.
<P>
<H3>II. Technical Surveillance</H3>

5. in view of the convergance of information technology and telecommunications, law pertaining to technical surveillance for the purpose of criminal investigations, such as interception of telecommunications, should be reviewed and amended, where necessary, to ensure their applicability.
<P>


6. The law should permit investigating authorities to avail themselves of all necessary technical measures that enable the collection of traffic data in the investigation of crimes.
<P>
7. When collected in the course of a criminal investigation and in particular when obtained by means of intercepting telecommunications, data which is the object of legal protection and processed by a compuer system should be secured in an appropriate manner.
<P>
8. Criminal procedure laws should be reviewed with a view to making possible the interception of telecommunications and the collection of traffic data in the investigation of serious offenses against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of telecommunications or computer systems.
<P>

<H3>III. Obligations to co-operate with the investigating authorities</H3>

<P>
9. Subject to legal privileges or protection, most legal systems permit investigating authorities to order persons to hand over objects under their control that are required to serve as evidence. In a parallel fashion, provisions should be made for the power to order persons to submit any specified data under their control in a computer system in the form required by the investigating authority.
<P>
10. Subject to legal privileges or protection, investigating authorities should have the power to order persons who have data in a computer system under their control to provide all necessary information to enable access to a computer system and the data theirin. Criminal procedure law should ensure that a similar order can be given to other persons who have knowledge about the functioning of the computer system or measures applied to secure the data therein.
<P>
11. Specific obligations should be imposed on operators of public and private networks that offer telecommunications services to the public to avail themselves of all necessary technical measures that enable the interception of telecommunications by the investigating authorities.
<P>
12. Specific obligations should be imposed on service providers who offer telecommunications services to the public, either through public or private networks, to provide information to identify the user, when so ordered by the compentant investigating authority.
<P>

<H3>IV. Electronic Evidence</H3>

13. The common need to collect, preserve, and present electronic evidence in ways that best ensure and reflect their integrity and irrefutable authenticity, both for the purposes of domestic prosecution and international co-operation, should be recognized. Therefore, procedures and technical methods for handling electronic evidence should be further developed, and particularly in such a way as to ensure their compatability between states. Criminal procedural law provisions on evidence relating to tradition documents should similarly apply to data stored in a computer system.


<H3>V. Use of Encryption</H3>

14. Measures should be considered to minimise the negative effects of the use of cryptography on the investigation of criminal offenses, without affecting its legitimate use more than is strictly necessary.


<H3>VI. Research, statistics and training</H3>


15. The risks involved in the development and application of information technology with regard to the commission of criminal offenses should be assured continuously. In order to enable the competent authorities to keep abrest of new phenomena in the field of computer related offenses and to develop appropriate counter-measures, the collection and analysis of data on these offenses, including modus operandi and technical apsects, should be furthered.
<P>
16. The establishment of specialised units for the investigation of offenses, the combating of which requires special expertise in information technology, should be considered. Training programmes enabling criminal justice personnel to avail themselves of expertise in this field should be furthered.
<P>

<H3>VII. International Cooperation</H3>


17. The power to extend a search to other computer systems should also be applicable when the system is located in a foreign jurisdiction, provided that immediate action is required. In order to avoid possible violations of state sovereignity or international law, an unambigious legal basis for such extended search and seizure should be established. Therefore, there is an urgent need for negotiating international agreements as to how, when and to what extent such search and seizure should be permitted.
<P>
18. Expedited and adequate procedures as well as a system of liason should be available according to which the investigating authorities may request the foreign authorities to promptly collect evidence.  For that purpose the requested authorities should be authorized to search a computer system and seize data with a view to its subsequent transfer.  The requested authorities should also be authorized to provide trafficking data rtelated to a specific telecommunication, intercept a specific telecommunication or identify its source. For that purpose, the existing mutual legal assistance instruments need to be supplemented.

This report provides an analysis of the key aspects of identity (ID) cards and related technologies. It has been prepared by Privacy International in the wake of widespread concern across the world about the implications of modern ID systems. Our intention here is to discuss the evidence at an international level and to promote debate about the claims made about such card systems. <P>
The principle author of this report is Simon Davies, Director General of Privacy International and Visiting Fellow in the London School of Economics. Assistance and input to this report was provided by members of PI throughout North America, Europe and Asia.</Font><P>

<H3><A NAME="1">1. How many countries use ID cards ? </A></H3>
<BR>
Identity (ID) cards are in use, in one form or another in numerous countries around the world. The type of card, its function, and its integrity vary enormously. Around a hundred countries have official, compulsory, national IDs that are used for a variety of purposes. Many developed countries, however, do not have such a card. Amongst these are the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Ireland, the Nordic countries and Sweden. Those that do have such a card include Germany, France, Belgium, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain.<P>
The use of sectoral (specific purpose) cards for health or social security is widespread, and most countries that do not have a national universal card, have a health or social security card (in Australia, the Medicare Card, in the United States, the Social Security number), or traditional paper documents of identity. The reverse is also true. In Sweden, while there exists a ubiquitous national number, there is no single official identity card. <A HREF="#fn1">1</A><P>
Generally speaking, particularly in advanced societies, the key element of the card is its number. The number is used as an administrative mechanism for a variety of purposes. In many countries the number is used as a general reference to link the card holders activities in many areas.<P>
An analysis of identity cards around the world reveals a number of interesting patterns. The most significant of these is that virtually no common law country has a card. Nor does the economic or political development of a country necessarily determine whether it has a card. Neither Mexico nor Bangladesh have an ID card. And, until this year, India had no card (even now, the card, strictly speaking, is a voter registration card rather than a national ID card). Generally speaking, however, the vast majority of developing countries have either an ID card system or a document system,often based on regional rather than national authorization. <A HREF="#fn2">2</A><P>
In many countries, identification documents are being replaced by plastic cards, which are seen as more durable and harder to forge. Card technology companies are well organized to conduct effective promotion of their product, and companies have moved into the remotest regions of the world. Many Asian and African nations are replacing old documents with magnetic stripe or bar coded cards. The South African Passbook is being replaced by a card. The UK drivers license is also being replaced by a photo ID card from 1996. The change from one form of ID to another is invariably accompanied by a change to the nature and content of data on the document. <BR>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="2">2. What are the main purposes of ID cards?</A></H3>
<BR>
ID cards are established for a variety of reasons. Race, politics and religion were often at the heart of older ID systems. The threat of insurgents or political extremists, and the exercise of religious discrimination have been all too common as motivation for the establishment of ID systems which would force enemies of the State into registration, or make them vulnerable in the open without proper documents. In Pakistan, the cards are used to enforce a quota system, In China, they are used as a tool of social engineering.<P>
In the United Kingdom, current proposals for a national ID card are fuelled by the need to develop a document which is acceptable to other European countries, as well as a belief that the scheme might help fight crime. In Australia, the purpose of the proposed card was to fight tax evasion, and, in New Zealand, to establish Social Welfare entitlement. The Dutch card has the dual purpose of helping to improve government administrative efficiency, while playing a key role in dismantling border controls. <A HREF="#fn3">3</A><P>
At the heart of such plans is a parallel increase in police powers. Even in democratic nations, police retain the right to demand ID on pain of detention.<P>
In recent years, ID cards have been linked to national registration systems, which in turn form the basis of government administration. In such systems - for example Spain, Portugal, Thailand and Singapore - the ID card becomes merely one visible component of a much larger system. With the advent of magnetic stripes and microprocessor technology, these cards can also become an interface for receipt of government services. Thus the cards become a fusion of a service technology, and a means of identification.<P>
This dual function is expressed well by one Philippines Senator in the introduction to her 1991 ID card Bill as an integrated relationship between the citizen and his government. <A HREF="#fn4">4</A><P>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="3">3. What are the main types of ID systems in use?</A></H3>
<BR>
Broadly expressed, there are three different forms of ID card systems :<BR>
<ul><BR>
1. Stand Alone documents <P>
2. Registration systems<P>
3. integrated systems<BR>
</ul><BR>
Stand Alone ID documents are issued in primitive conditions, or in environments which are subject to sudden economic or political change. Often, areas under military rule or emergency law will issue on the spot ID cards which are, essentially, internal passports. Their principle purpose is to establish that a person is authorized to live in a region.<P>
The majority of ID systems have a support register which contains parallel information to that on the card. This register is often maintained by a regional or municipal authority. In a minority of countries, this is a national system. Even countries such as France and Germany have no national ID card register. Germany has constitutional limitations on the establishment of any national number.<P>
Virtually all card systems established in the past ten years are Integrated systems. They have been designed to form the basis of general government administration. The card number is, in effect, a national registration number used as a common identifier for many government agencies.<P>
It is interesting to note that residents of countries which have ID documents or papers, often refer to these in the English as ICs or Identity cards. The Afghan Tazkira is a 16 page booklet, but is often referred to as a card. Likewise, in Poland, where the form of ID is a passport-like booklet called 'Dowod osobisty' (or, literally, personal evidence it is translated universally as a card.<P>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="4">4. What information do the cards contain?</A></H3>
<BR>
The majority of cards in use in developed nations have the holders name, sex, date of birth, and issuing coordinates printed on the card itself. An expiry date, and number is also embossed, along with a space for a signature. A minority of sectoral cards include a photograph.<A HREF="#fn5">5</A> Official cards issued by police or Interior Ministries generally do include a photograph, and in many cases, a fingerprint.<P>
In Brazil, for example, all residents are obliged to carry at all times a plasticated flexible card the size of a credit card bearing a photograph, thumb print, full name and parents' names, national status (Brazilian national or alien resident) and a serial number. <P>
In Chile, it is a small plastic card with photograph, names, date and place of birth, signature, and personal number. The Korean 'National Registration Card' shows name, birth date, permanent address, current address, military record, issuing agency, issued date, photograph, national identification number, and prints of both thumbs. The Malaysian identity Card has the date of birth, parents name, religion, ethnicity, sex, physical characteristics, place of birth and any other identification mark on the reverse side. The front face carries the photograph, fingerprints, and IC number.<P>
The Pakistan card carries a large amount of data, including photograph, signature, card serial number, government official's signature, Date of issue, DRO/Post office number, ID Card number, name, father's name, Temporary Address, Permanent Address, identification marks, and date of birth<P>
The German "Personalausweis". is a plastic ID card which contains, on the front side, name, date and place of birth, nationality, date of expiration, signature and photo. The name, date of birth and number of the card are machine readable (ocr). On the back side are address, height, color of eyes, issuing authority and date of issue. Addresses are changed by putting a sticker on the old address. <P>
The Italians have a larger format card (three by four inches) containing Identity number, name, photo, signature, fingerprint, date and place of birth, citizenship, residency, address, marital status, profession, and physical characteristics<P>
In a small number of cases, notably Singapore and some Asian nations, cards contain a bar code, which is seen by authorities as more reliable and durable than a mag stripe. The French are also moving toward a machine readable card.<P>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="5">5. What is the financial cost of an ID card system?</A></H3>
<BR>
In the Philippines, the United Kingdom and Australia, the cost of implementing an ID system has been at the forefront of political and public opposition to nationwide schemes. The Philippines proposal relied on government estimates that were drawn, as is often the case, from estimates calculated by computer industry consultants. These were found to under-estimate the true cost by eight billion pesos over seven years.<A HREF="#fn6">6</A> The proposal lapsed because of this factor.<P>
In Australia, the cost of the proposed ID card failed to take into account such factors as training costs, administrative supervision, staff turnover, holiday and sick leave, compliance costs, and overseas issue of cards.. Other costs that are seldom factored into the final figure (as was the case in Australia( are the cost of fraud, an underestimate of the cost of issuing and maintaining cards, and the cost to the private sector. As a consequence, the official figure for the Australia card almost doubled between 1986 and 1987. <P>
Private sector costs for complying with an ID card are very high. The Australian Bankers Association estimated that the system would cost their members over one hundred million dollars over ten years. Total private sector compliance costs were estimated at around one billion dollars annually.<P>
The official figure for the Australia card was $820 million over seven years. The revised estimate including private sector and compliance costs, together with other factors, would amount to several times this figure. <P>
The UK Governments CCTA (Information Technology Center) advised that a national smart ID card would cost between five and eight pounds sterling per head <A HREF="#fn7">7,</A> but this figure does not include administration, compliance etc. When he announced the introduction of a national ID card in August 1996, the Home Secretary, Michael Howard, advised that the cost as likely to be at least double the CCTA estimate (ten to fifteen pounds).<A HREF="#fn8">8</A><P>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="6">6. Can ID cards assist law enforcement?</A></H3>
<BR>
Although Law and Order is a key motivation for the establishment of ID cards in numerous countries, their usefulness to police has been marginal. In the UK. Home Secretary Michael Howard told the 1994 Tory Party conference that he believed an ID card could provide an invaluable tool in the fight against crime. This claim was toned down somewhat during the gestation of the proposal.<P>
Howard's claim received little support or substantive backing by academic or law enforcement bodies. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) said that while it is in favor of a voluntary system, its members would be reluctant to administer a compulsory card that might erode relations with the public. Dutch police authorities were not generally in favor of similar proposals in that country, for much the same reason. 9<P>
According to police in both countries, the major problem in combating crime is not lack of identification procedures, but difficulties in the gathering of evidence and the pursuit of a prosecution. Indeed, few police or criminologists have been able to advance any evidence whatever that the existence of a card would actually reduce the incidence of crime, or the success of prosecution. In a 1993 report, ACPO suggested that street crime, burglaries and crimes by bogus officials could be diminished through the use of an ID card, though this conflicted with its position that the card should be voluntary.<P>
In reality, only a national DNA database (such as has just been opened in Britain) or a biometric database (such as is being proposed in Ontario) might assist the police in linking crimes to perpetrators.<P>
Support along these lines for the introduction of cards is also predicated on the assumption that they will establish a means of improving public order by making people aware that they are being in some way observed. Sometimes, cards are proposed as a means of reducing the opportunity of crime. In 1989, the UK government moved to introduce machine readable ID cards to combat problems of violence and hooliganism at football grounds. The general idea was that cards would authorize the bearer to enter certain grounds and certain locations, but not others. They could also be canceled if the bearer was involved in any trouble at a ground or related area. The idea was scrapped after a report by the Lord Chief Justice claimed that such a scheme could increase the danger of disorder and loss of life in the event of a catastrophe at a ground.<P>
One unintended repercussion of ID card systems is that they can entrench widescale criminal false identity. By providing a one stop form of identity, criminals can easily use cards in several identities. Even the highest integrity bank cards are available as blanks in such countries as Singapore for several pounds. Within two months of the new Commonwealth Bank high security hologram cards being issued in Australia, near perfect forgeries were already in circulation.<P>
This conundrum has been debated in Australia, the UK and the Netherlands. It relies on the simple logic that the higher an ID cards value, the more it will be used. The more an ID card is used, the greater the value placed on it, and consequently, the higher is its value to criminal elements.<P>
There appears to be a powerful retributive thread running along the law and order argument. Some people are frustrated by what they see as the failure of the justice system to deal with offenders, and the ID card is seen, at the very least, as having an irritant value.<P>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="7">7. What impact do ID cards have on tax evasion and welfare fraud?</A></H3>
<BR>
The need to develop measures to combat fraud have prompted the introduction of widescale, integrated, information technology in most developed countries. These strategies have sometimes involved the use of cards.<P>
The cost of fraud can be significant, but the causes are often rooted deeply in human and organizational issues that technology may not be entirely capable of solving.<P>
Benefits agencies around the world have identified key precursors to fraud. Three levels of fraud are often expressed, in order of significance, as:<ul><P>
False declaration, or non declaration, of income and assets (problems which are also components of non-declaration of income for tax)<P>
Criminal acquisition of multiple benefits using false identification<P>
More conventional fraud and theft of benefit payments<BR>
</ul><BR>
These conditions should be considered alongside numerous other factors which contribute to benefit overpayment, including clerical error and genuine misunderstanding about the terms of payment.<P>
One of the central problems in responding to the question of fraud has been the general difficulty in assessing its nature and magnitude. Virtually no ethnographic research exists, and the data that do exist are drawn principally from internal and external audits, management reviews, and retrospective studies.<A HREF="#fn10">10 </A> Many methodologies have the effect of assessing risk, rather than quantifying actual fraud. No standard guidelines have yet been developed to assess the sort of information technology used in fraud control and identification.<A HREF="#fn11">11</A> Additional problems are found with the definition of fraud, and the terms of audit, which often do not parallel the parameters of internal departmental cost/benefit analyses.<A HREF="#fn12">12</A><P>
Estimates of the extent of fraud on benefits agencies varies widely. The Toronto Social Services Department, for example, officially estimates fraud by way of false identity at less than one tenth of one percent of benefits paid<A HREF="#fn13">13</A>, whereas the Australian Department of Social Security estimates the figure at ten times that amount.<A HREF="#fn14">14</A> Estimates of fraud vary widely between one tenth on one per cent of total benefits, to as high as four percent.<A HREF="#fn15">15</A> Britain's popular estimate of one to two billion pounds is, in international terms, at the high end of the spectrum.<P>
The Parliamentary Select Committee on the Australia Card warned that the revenue promises of the card scheme were little better than "Qualitative assessment" - in other words, guesswork. The Department of Finance refused to support the Health Insurance Commission's (HIC) cost benefit estimates (the HIC was the principle agency behind the scheme). Revenue was constantly revised downward, while the costs continued to rise. The Department of Social Security insisted that the ID card would have done little or nothing to diminish welfare fraud. In evidence to the parliamentary committee investigating the proposal, the Department said that much less than one per cent of benefit overpayments resulted from false identity. The Department decided that it would pursue other means of tackling fraud. The DSS in the UK argued against ID cards on the same grounds.<P>
The Australian DSS estimates that benefit overpayment by way of false identity accounts for 0.6 per cent of overpayments, whereas non-reporting of income variation accounts for 61 per cent. The key area of interest, from the perspective of benefit agencies, lies in creating a single numbering system which would be used as a basis for employment eligibility, and which would reduce the size of the black market economy.<P>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="8">8. Can ID cards help to control illegal immigration?</A></H3>
 <P>
Yes and no. Although the immigration issue is a principle motivation behind ID card proposals in continental Europe, the United States and some smaller developing nations, the impact of cards on illegal immigration has been patchy<P>
The abolition of internal borders has become a primary concern of the new European Union. The development of the Schengen agreement between the Benelux countries, France, Spain and Germany calls for the dismantling of all border checks, in return for a strengthening of internal procedures for vetting of the population. France and the Netherlands have already passed legislation allowing for identity checks on a much broader basis, and other countries are likely to follow.<P>
The establishment of personal identity in the new borderless Europe is a contentious issue, but is one which appears (to many people) to be a broadly acceptable trade-off for the convenience of greater freedom of movement within the union. <P>
The use of a card for purposes of checking resident status depends on the police and other officials being given very broad powers to check identity. More important from the perspective of civil rights, its success will depend on the exercise of one of two processes : either a vastly increased level of constant checking of the entire population, or, a discriminatory checking procedure which will target minorities.<P>
The two arguments most often put forward to justify the quest to catch illegal immigrants in any country are (1) that these people are taking jobs that should belong to citizens and permanent residents, and (2) that these people are often illegally collecting unemployment and other government benefits.<P>
The image of the illegal immigrant living off the welfare of the State is a powerful one, and it is used to maximum effect by proponents of ID cards. When, however, the evidence is weighed scientifically, it does not bear any resemblance to the claim. When the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australia Card considered the issue, it found that the real extent of illegal immigrants collecting government benefits was extremely low. The report described a mass data matching episode to determine the exact number. Of more than 57,000 overstayers in New South Wales, only 22 were found in the match against Social Security files to be receiving government unemployment benefits. That is, 22 out of a state population of five million. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (DIEA) had earlier claimed that the figure was thirty times this amount (12.4 per cent as opposed to 0.4 per cent of overstayers).<P>
Indeed most immigration authorities worldwide base their estimates on qualitative assessment. Again quoting from the Australia Card inquiry It became clear that the estimates for illegal immigrants were based on guesswork, the percentage of illegal immigrants who worked was based on guesswork, the percentage of visitors who worked illegally came from a Departmental report that was based on guesswork....The Committee has little difficulty in rejecting DIEA evidence as being grossly exaggerated.<P>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="9">9. Do ID cards facilitate an increase in police powers ?</A></H3>
<BR>
Generally speaking, yes. A Privacy International survey of ID cards found claims of police abuse by way of the cards in virtually all countries. Most involved people being arbitrarily detained after failure to produce their card. Others involved beatings of juveniles or minorities. There were even instances of wholesale discrimination on the basis of data set out on the cards.<P>
While it is true that cards containing non-sensitive data are less likely to be used against the individual, cards are often alleged to be the vehicle for discriminatory practices. Police who are given powers to demand ID invariably have consequent powers to detain people who do not have the card, or who cannot prove their identity. Even in such advanced countries as Germany, the power to hold such people for up to 24 hours is enshrined in law. The question of who is targeted for ID checks is left largely to the discretion of police.<P>
The wartime ID card used in the UK outlived the war, and found its way into general use until the early 1950s. Police became used to the idea of routinely demanding the card, until in 1953 the High Court ruled that the practice was unlawful. In a landmark ruling that led to the repealing of the National Registration Act, and the abandonment of the ID card, the Lord Chief Justice remarked :<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>... although the police may have powers, it does not follow that they should exercise them on all occasions...it is obvious that the police now, as a matter of routine, demand the production of national registration identity cards whenever they stop or interrogate a motorist for any cause....This Act was passed for security purposes and not for the purposes for which, apparently it is now sought to be used.... in this country we have always prided ourselves on the good feeling that exists between the police and the public, and such action tends to make the public resentful of the acts of police and inclines them to obstruct them rather than assist them. 16</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="10">10. Do ID cards facilitate discrimination?</A></H3>
<BR>
Yes. The success of ID cards as a means of fighting crime or illegal immigration will depend on a discriminatory checking procedure which will target minorities.<P>
The irony of the ID card option is that it invites discrimination by definition. Discriminatory practices are an inherent part of the function of an ID card. Without this discrimination, police would be required to conduct random checks, which in turn, would be politically unacceptable.<P>
All discrimination is based on one of two conditions : situational or sectoral. Situational discrimination targets people in unusual circumstances. i.e. walking at night, visiting certain areas, attending certain functions or activities, or behaving in an abnormal fashion. Sectoral discrimination targets people having certain characteristics i.e. blacks, youths, skinheads, motor cycle riders or the homeless. ID cards containing religious or ethnic information make it possible to carry this discrimination a step further.<P>
Several developed nations have been accused of conducting discriminatory practices using ID cards. The Government of Japan recently came under fire from the United Nations Human Rights Committee for this practice. The Committee had expressed concern that Japan had passed a law requiring that foreign residents must carry identification cards at all times. The 18-member panel examined human rights issues in Japan in accordance with the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Japan ratified the covenant in 1979. The Alien Registration Law, ``the Committee complained in its report, is not consistent with the covenant''.<P>
Ironically, the Parliaments of several European nations, including France and Holland, have accepted a law introducing the obligation to identify oneself in numerous situations including, for instance, at work, at football stadiums, on public transport an in banks. While the card is voluntary in name, it is in effect a compulsory instrument that will be carried at all times by Dutch citizens. Moreover, foreigners can always be asked to identify themselves to authorities at any moment and in any circumstance. <P>
French police have been accused of overzealous use of the ID card against blacks, and particularly against Algerians. Greek authorities have been accused of using data on religious affiliation on its national card to discriminate against people who are not Greek Orthodox.<P>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="11">11. To what extent will an ID card become an internal passport?</A></H3>
<BR>
An ID card, by definition, is a form of internal passport. Virtually all ID cards worldwide develop a broader usage over time, than was originally envisioned for them. This development of new and unintended purposes is becoming known as function creep. <P>
All ID cards - whether voluntary or compulsory - develop into an internal passport of sorts. Without care, the card becomes an icon. Its use is enforced through mindless regulation or policy, disregarding other means of identification, and in the process causing significant problems for those who are without the card. The card becomes more important than the individual.<P>
The use of cards in most countries has become universal. All government benefits, dealings with financial institutions, securing employment or rental accommodation, renting cars or equipment and obtaining documents requires the card. It is also used in myriad small ways, such as entry to official buildings (where security will invariably confiscate and hold the card). <P>
Ironically, many card subjects come to interpret this state of affairs in a contra view (the card helps streamline my dealings with authority, rather than the card is my license to deal with authorities). The Australia Card campaign referred to the card as a license to live.<P>
It is clear that any official ID system will ultimately extend into more and more functions. Any claim that an official card is voluntary should not imply that a card will be any less of an internal passport than would a compulsory card. Indeed a voluntary card may suffer the shortcoming of limited protections in law. <P>
During the campaign against the Australia Card, talk back radio hosts had become fond of quoting a paragraph of an HIC planning document on the Australia Card:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It will be important to minimize any adverse public reaction to implementation of the system. One possibility would be to use a staged approach for implementation, whereby only less sensitive data are held in the system initially with the facility to input additional data at a later stage when public acceptance may be forthcoming more readily. <A HREF="#fn17">17</A> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
The campaign organizers stressed the pseudo-voluntary nature of the card. Whilst it was not technically compulsory for a person to actually obtain a card, it would have been extremely difficult to live in society without it. <P>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="12">12. What happens if an ID card is lost or stolen? </A></H3>
<BR>
Virtually all countries with ID cards report that their loss or damage causes immense problems. Up to five per cent of cards are lost, stolen or damaged each year, and the result can be denial of service ad benefits, and - in the broadest sense - loss of identity. <P>
There exists a paradox in the replacement of cards. The replacement of a high security, high integrity card involves significant administrative involvement. Documents must be presented in person to an official. Cards must be processed centrally. This process can take some weeks. However, a low value card can be replaced in a lesser time, but its loss poses security threats because of the risk of fraud and misuse.<P>
People who lose a wallet full of cards quickly understand the misfortune and inconvenience that can result. A single ID card when lost or stolen can have precisely the same impact in a persons life.<P>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="13">13. What are the privacy implications of an ID card?</A></H3>
<BR>
In short, the implications are profound. The existence of a persons life story in a hundred unrelated databases is one important condition that protects privacy. The bringing together of these separate information centers creates a major privacy vulnerability. Any multi-purpose national ID card has this effect.<P>
Some privacy advocates in the UK argue against ID cards on the basis of evidence from various security threat models in use throughout the private sector. In these models, it is generally assumed that at any one time, one per cent of staff will be willing to sell or trade confidential information for personal gain. In many European countries, up to one per cent of bank staff are dismissed each year, often because of theft.<P>
The evidence for this potential corruption is compelling. Recent inquiries in Australia, <A HREF="#fn18">18</A> Canada <A HREF="#fn19">19</A> and the United States <A HREF="#fn20">20</A> indicate that widespread abuse of computerized information is occurring. Corruption amongst information users inside and outside the government in New South Wales had become endemic and epidemic. Virtually all instances of privacy violation related to computer records.<P>
Data Protection law is wholly inadequate to deal with the use of ID cards. Indeed legislation in most countries facilitates the use of ID cards, while doing little or nothing to limit the spectrum of its uses or the accumulation of data on the card or its related systems. <P>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="14">14. Has any country rejected proposals for ID cards?</A></H3>
<BR>
Yes, several. France's ID card, for example, was stalled for many years because of public and political opposition. Until the late 1970s, French residents were required to possess a national identity document. This was made of paper, and was subject to the risk of forgery. In 1979, however, the Ministry of the Interior announced plans for a higher integrity automated card encased in plastic. The card was to be used for anti terrorism and law enforcement purposes. The card, to be issued to all 50 million residents of France, was to be phased in over a ten year period. New laser technology was to be used to produce the cards. <A HREF="#fn21">21</A><P>
At first, there appeared to be little resistance to the proposal, but in a fashion similar to Australian experience (see below), political and public resistance grew as details of the plan emerged. Although no identity numbers were to be used (only card numbers) there was some concern over the possible impact of such cards. Frances information watchdog, CNIL, managed to suppress the machine readable function of the proposed cards, though optical scanning made magnetic stripes somewhat redundant. Publications such as Le Figaro expressed concern that the cards and related information could be linked with other police and administrative systems. <P>
Public debate intensified in 1980, with the Union of Magistrates expressing concern that an ID card had the potential of limiting the right of free movement. In response to these and other criticisms, the ruling of CNIL was that no number relating to an individual could be used, but that each card would carry a number. If the card had to be replaced, a new number would apply to that particular document.<P>
In 1981, the Socialists were elected, and the fate of the ID card was reversed. In an election statement on informatics, Francois Mitterrand expressed the view that the creation of computerized identity cards contains a real danger for the liberty of individuals. His concern was echoed by the minister for the Justice, Robert Badinter, explained that ID cards presented a real danger to the individual liberties and private life of citizens, and the new Minister for Interior then announced the demise of ID cards in France.<A HREF="#fn22">22</A> The plan was re-introduced under a later conservative government.<P>
In the United States, issues of individual autonomy and national sovereignty appear to have dominated the Identity card issue. Despite a high level of anxiety over fraud, tax evasion and illegal immigrants, successive administrations have refused to propose an ID card. Extension of the Social Security Number to the status of an ID card has been rejected in 1971 by the Social Security Administration task force on the SSN. In 1973 the Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) Secretary's Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems concluded that a national identifier was not desirable. In 1976 the Federal Advisory Committee on false Identification rejected the idea of a national identifier. In 1977 the Carter administration reiterated that the SSN was not to become a national identifier, and in 1981 the Reagan Administration stated that it was explicitly opposed to the creation of an ID card. Throughout the debates over health care reform, the Clinton Administration has also constantly stressed that it is opposed to a national identifier. <A HREF="#fn23">23</A><P>
It remains the case that the SSN continues to be a de facto national identifier, despite constant rulings and legislation to the contrary. With an estimated four to ten million false or redundant numbers, there is concern that the SSN might in fact help to entrench illegal immigration or fraud, nevertheless, there is no plan to upgrade the number.<P>
Some of the federal agencies mandated to use the SSN are the Social Security Administration, Civil Service Commission, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Defence, food stamp program, Department of Justice, Department of energy, Department of Treasury, Department of State, Department of Interior, Department of Labor, Department of Veterans Affairs, and to all federal agencies for use as an identifier for record keeping purposes. State agencies can also use the number for welfare, health and revenue purposes, and third parties are mandated to request the SSN for verification for products or services.<P>
In recent months, proposals by the Clinton administration to reform the US health sector have involved plans to streamline the administration and information flow amongst all health insurers and providers. This proposal involves a national card system, though the federal administration has insisted that the card would not be general in nature. A recent scheme for employment verification also provoked an outcry when concerns were raised that it would lead to the creation of a national ID scheme.<P>
The most celebrated campaign against a national ID card occurred a decade ago in Australia. In 1986, the Australian Government introduced legislation for a national ID card called the Australia Card. Its purpose was to form the basis of the administration of major government agencies, to link the finance and government sector, and to perform the standard identification functions necessary in the commercial and Social Security sectors. <P>
The card became the focus of the single biggest civil campaign in recent Australian history, and certainly the most notable campaign of its type anywhere in the world. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets, and the government was dangerously split over the issue. The proposal caused such hostility that the card was abandoned in 1987.<A HREF="#fn24">24</A><P>
In 1991, the government of New Zealand drew up a strategy to reform its health care and social welfare system through the development of a data matching program, and the introduction of a sectoral national identity card. The card would link major Government departments and would have the capacity to track all financial dealings and even geographical movements. The plan was known as "social bank", and the card was to be known as a Kiwi Card.<P>
The proposal for a national card had angered civil libertarians and law reform groups, partly because the card would be used to enforce a part payment health system, partly because it was to be established without protections in law, and partly because it would create significant problems for certain minority groups. Under the leadership of the Auckland Council for Civil Liberties, a campaign of opposition was formed in August 1991. Unlike the Australian campaigners four years earlier, the New Zealand campaigners had a precedent from which to develop a strategy.<P>
Although the fight to destroy the Kiwi Card was not anywhere near as spectacular as the Australia Card campaign, the controversy resulted in the abandonment of the card, and the adoption of a low integrity entitlement card (issued in two forms) for the purpose of health benefits. <A HREF="#fn25">25</A><BR>

<CENTER><H2>Some Positive Aspects of Privacy Law</H2>

<H3>Blair Stewart</H3>
<P>
ADVANCED SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE, 
<P>
Copenhagen, 4 September 1995</CENTER>
<P>
<I>Summary of an address given by Blair Stewart, Manager, Codes and Legislation,
Office of the Privacy Commissioner, New Zealand</I>
<P>
The New Zealand Privacy Act, passed in 1993, drew upon the OECD guidelines
and learned from the experiences of European data protection laws and the
Australian Privacy Act.
<P>
The Privacy Act contains 12 information privacy principles governing the
collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information, however the
information is held.  It also has a principle dealing with unique identifiers
and contains individual access and correction rights.
<P>
The principles cover all agencies whether in the private or public sector,
unless specifically excluded.  Very few exclusions are contained in the law.
Parliament is one. The news media in their news activities is another.  The
police are not excluded from the privacy law.
<P>
If an information privacy principle is breached, and an individual is harmed
or embarrassed as a result, a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner can be
made, a settlement sought, or damages or an injunction obtained through a
Tribunal.
<P>
The Act also contains principles for public registers and guidelines for data
matching.
<P>
The Privacy Commissioner can issue codes of practice to modify the principles
for a sector, activity or type of information.  The Commissioner is also
given the function of reporting on legislation, Government policy or new
technology, affecting the privacy of individuals.
<P>
That is a very quick overview of the Privacy Act.  More detail of the New
Zealand privacy legislation can be obtained from the Privacy Commissioner's
home page which can be found at http://www.kete.co.nz/privacy/welcome.htm.
<P>
I should emphasise that the Privacy Act that I have just described is a
broader privacy law than most other jurisdictions - Quebec, at provincial
level, being the most comparable law currently in force.  The law is broad in
two respects:<br>
  it covers both computerised information and all other "manual" data - it
would include, for instance, simple notes on a file or a photograph or video
as well as computer or manual databases;<br>
  it covers both public and private sectors - and the coverage of the private
sector is particularly important as the difference between the public and
private spheres blur.<br>
<P>
Earlier parts of this conference have focused on "cutting edge" sophisticated
surveillance and tracking technology and activities.  Although the position
can, of course, change New Zealand does not at present suffer from the
extremes earlier described at the conference.  Nonetheless, it might be
useful to mention some of the law enforcement or surveillance issues which
have interacted with our privacy law recently.  I hope to suggest that a
privacy law has a positive effect on these issues.
<P>
<H3>Complaints jurisdiction oversight</H3>

Law enforcement authorities in New Zealand became subject to a new oversight
mechanism in the form of the Privacy Commissioner when the Privacy Act was
passed. Complaints can be received in relation to information collection
activities such as questioning or strip searches, or disclosure of data
within or outside the jurisdiction.  The Privacy Act provides remedies for
individuals who have suffered some harm.  This contrasts with some of the
existing oversight mechanisms, such as the Police Complaints Authority, which
in relation to substantiated complaints are concerned with disciplining the
law enforcement officers concerned and trying to ensure that systems are in
place so as a particular problem is not repeated.  There is no focus on
individual remedy under a disciplinary system.

<H3>Drug testing</H3>

New Zealand recently enacted a Sports Drug Testing Act.  The Privacy
Commissioner provided some input into the process and, in my view, this lead
to a better law in privacy terms notwithstanding some remaining concerns at
the outcome.  However, this law is an illustration of the effect of
international agreements (whether between governments or between private
national sporting organisations) limiting a society's control over decisions
concerning the use of intrusive surveillance technology, in this case, drug
testing.  The argument is that a country might be barred from international
competition unless it institutes random drug testing.

<H3>DNA</H3>

The New Zealand Parliament is presently considering legislation to enable
suspects to be ordered by the High Court to give samples for forensic DNA
analysis for certain specified offences.  The Bill will also create a DNA
databank of profiles from certain convicted offenders.  The Privacy
Commissioner has been closely involved in the policy and legislative process
and this has led to a better bill from a privacy perspective. However, the
Commissioner retains concerns about several aspects of the bill including a
provision enabling the Police to invite individuals to "voluntarily" add
their samples to the databank.  This contrasts with the older surveillance
technology of fingerprinting in respect of which the Police have never been
permitted to "voluntarily" collect fingerprints from innocent citizens.

<H3>Code of practice for the Police</H3>

A code of practice is being developed under the Privacy Act for the Police.
The information privacy principles already apply to the Police but the code
will create a more specific set of rules for various things such as video
surveillance in public places.

<H3>Data Matching </H3>

The Privacy Act controls data matching between public agencies
in New Zealand and requires legal authorisation for each programme and a
rigorous analysis and justification in relation to a set of information
matching guidelines.  One proposal at present under consideration is to match
the electoral roll against a list of illegal immigrants.
<P>
To wrap up I would like to briefly reflect on some of the comments earlier
made by Simon Davies, Steve Wright and Stephanie Perrin.
<P>
Simon suggested that there is a need for more polemic in the privacy debate
and the data protection laws have actually seen a trading off of privacy
interests.  He suggests the need for more public militancy.  He may well be
right, but it is questionable whether a public official, such as a Privacy
Commissioner, can take the place of an informed political debate.  The New
Zealand Privacy Commissioner is required by law to take account of the public
interests that compete with privacy including the need for a free flow of
information and the ability of Government and business to operate
efficiently.  Steve Wright suggested the need for public education and
Stephanie Perrin outlined the Canadian Standards Association initiative which
might, in one sense, be categorised as industry education.
<P>
Clearly a Privacy Commissioner cannot alone adequately prevent moves toward
a surveillance society.  To do that we require a well informed and more vocal public.  We
also require Government administrators and lawmakers to be better informed on privacy
issues.  We also require business to better consider fair information practices.  All of
these ingredients are necessary.  However, a comprehensive privacy law is arguably a very good start in protecting individuals from intrusive surveillance and other privacy dangers.
<P>

The rapid evolution of technology is leading to the creation of a
seamless web of surveillance across much of the world.  Powerful technologies
origionally developed for the military are being adopted by law enforcement and
civilian agencies and private companies to monitor entire populations. This has
been further fueled by the end of the Cold War and increasing demands for
greater bureaucratic efficiency. Existing laws and regulations have failed to
keep up with these developments.<p>
This one day conference will examine a range of advanced surveillance
technologies and their impact on privacy and other civil liberties. It will
explore the process of planning and implementation of the technologies, their
operating conditions, and the people and organizations respnsible for them. The
conference will also examine possible technical, regulatory and legal
responses. <p>
The conference will also address in detail the findings of Privacy
International's "Big Brother Incorporated" report which examined the
international trade in surveillance technology and the involvement of the arms
industry.<p>

On the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

</center>
<p>
The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union,<p>
<p>
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in
particular Article 100a thereof,<p>
<p>
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (<a href="Final_EC_Directive95_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a>),<p>
<p>
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (<a
href="Final_EC_Directive95_fn.html#fn1">[2]</a>),<p>
<p>
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189b of the
Treaty (<a href="Final_EC_Directive95_fn.html#fn2">[3]</a>),<p>
<p>
Whereas the objectives of the Community, as laid down in the Treaty, as amended
by the Treaty on European Union, include establishing an ever closer union
among the people of Europe, fostering closer relations between the States
belonging to the Community, ensuring economic and social progress by common
action to eliminate the barriers which divide Europe, encouraging the constant
improvement of the living conditions of its people, preserving and
strengthening peace and liberty and promoting democracy on the basis of the
fundamental rights recognized in the constitutions and laws of the Member
States and in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms;<p>
<p>
Whereas data-processing systems are designed to serve man; whereas they must,
whatever the nationality or residence of natural persons, respect the
fundamental freedoms and rights of individuals, notably the right to privacy,
and contribute to economic and social progress, trade expansion and the
well-being of individuals;<p>
<p>
Whereas the establishment and functioning of an internal market in which, in
accordance with Article 7a of the Treaty, the free movement of goods, persons,
services and capital is ensured require not only that personal data should be
able to flow freely from one Member State to another, but also that the
fundamental rights of individuals should be safeguarded.<p>
<p>
Whereas increasingly frequent recourse is being had in the Community to the
processing of personal data in the various spheres of economic and social
activity; whereas the progress made in information technology is making the
processing and exchange of such data considerably easier;<p>
<p>
Whereas the economic and social integration resulting from the establishment
and functioning of the internal market within the meaning of Article 7a of the
Treaty will necessarily lead to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of
personal data between all those involved in a private or public capacity in
economic and social activity in the Member States; whereas the exchange of
personal data between undertakings in different Member States is set to
increase; whereas the national authorities in the various Member States are
being called upon by virtue of Community law to collaborate and exchange
personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry out tasks on
behalf of an authority in another Member State within the context of the area
without internal frontiers as constituted by the Internal Market;<p>
<p>
Whereas, furthermore, the increase in scientific and technical cooperation and
the coordinated introduction of new telecommunications networks in the
Community necessitate and facilitate cross-border flows of personal data;<p>
<p>
Whereas the difference in levels of protection of the rights and freedoms of
individuals, notably the right to privacy, with regard to the processing of
personal data afforded in the Member States may prevent the transmission of
such data from the territory of one Member State to that of another Member
State; whereas this difference may therefore constitute an obstacle to the
pursuit of a number of economic activities at Community level, distort
competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities
under Community law; whereas this difference in levels of protection is due to
the existence of a wide variety of national laws, regulations and
administrative provisions;<p>
<p>
Whereas, in order to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data, the level
of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the
processing of such data must be equivalent in all the Member States; whereas
this objective is vital to the internal market but cannot be achieved by Member
States alone, especially in view of the scale of the divergences which
currently exist between the relevant laws in the Member States and the need to
coordinate the laws of the Member States so as to ensure that the cross-border
flow of personal data is regulated in a consistent manner that is in keeping
with the objective of the internal market as provided for in Article 7a of the
Treaty; whereas Community action to approximate those laws is therefore needed;
<p>
<p>
Whereas, given the equivalent protection resulting from the approximation of
national laws, the Member States will no longer be able to inhibit the free
movement between them of personal data on grounds relating to protection of the
rights and freedoms of individuals, and in particular the right to privacy;
whereas Member States will be left a margin for manoeuvre, which may, in the
context of implementation of the Directive, also be exercised by the business
and social partners; whereas Member States will therefore be able to specify in
their national law the general conditions governing the lawfulness of data
processing; whereas in doing so the Member States shall strive to improve the
protection currently provided by their legislation; whereas, within the limits
of this margin for manoeuvre and in accordance with Community law, disparities
could arise in the implementation of the Directive, and this could have an
effect on the movement of data within a Member State as well as within the
Community;<p>
<p>
Whereas the object of the national laws on the processing of personal data is
to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, which
is recognized both in Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection
of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in the general principles of
Community law; whereas, for that reason, the approximation of those laws must
not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the
contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community;<p>
<p>
Whereas the principles of the protection of the rights and freedoms of
individuals, notably the right to privacy, which are contained in this
Directive, give substance to and amplify those contained in the Council of
Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with
regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data;<p>
<p>
Whereas the protection principles must apply to all processing of personal data
by any person whose activities are governed by Community law; whereas there
should be excluded the processing of data carried out by a natural person in
the exercise of activities which are exclusively personal or domestic, such as
correspondence and the holding of records of addresses;<p>
<p>
Whereas the activities referred to in Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European
Union regarding public safety, defence, State security or the activities of the
State in the area of criminal law fall outside the scope of Community law,
without prejudice to the obligations incumbent upon Member States under Article
56(2), Article 57 or Article 100a of the Treaty establishing the European
Community; whereas the processing of personal data that is necessary to
safeguard the economic well-being of the State does not fall within the scope
of this Directive where such processing relates to State security matters;<p>
<p>
Whereas, given the importance of the developments under way, in the framework
of the information society, of the techniques used to capture, transmit,
manipulate, record, store or communicate sound and image data relating to
natural persons, this Directive should be applicable to processing involving
such data;<p>
<p>
Whereas the processing of such data is covered by this Directive only if it is
automated or if the data processed are contained or are intended to be
contained in a filing system structured according to specific criteria relating
to individuals, so as to permit easy access to the personal data in question;<p>
<p>
Whereas the processing of sound and image data, such as in cases of video
surveillance, does not come within the scope of this Directive if it is carried
out for the purposes of public security, defence, national security or in the
course of State activities relating to the area of criminal law or of other
activities which do not come within the scope of Community law;<p>
<p>
Whereas as far as the processing of sound and image data carried out for
purposes of journalism or the purposes of literary or artistic expression is
concerned, in particular in the audiovisual field, the principles of the
Directive are to apply in a restricted manner according to the provisions laid
down in Article 9,<p>
<p>
Whereas, in order to ensure that individuals are not deprived of the protection
to which they are entitled under this Directive, any processing of personal
data in the Community must be carried out in accordance with the law of one of
the Member States; whereas, in this connection, processing carried out under
the responsibility of a controller who is established in a Member State should
be governed by the law of that State;<p>
<p>
Whereas establishment on the territory of a Member State implies the effective
and real exercise of activity through the means of a stable set-up; whereas the
legal form of such an establishment, whether a simple branch or a subsidiary
with a legal personality, is not the determinate factor in this respect;
whereas, when a single controller is established on the territory of several
Member States, particularly be means of a subsidiary, he must ensure, in order
to avoid any circumvention of national rules, that each of the establishments
fulfils the obligations imposed by the national law applicable to its
activities;<p>
<p>
Whereas the fact that processing is carried out by a person established in a
third country must not stand in the way of the protection of individuals
provided for in this Directive; whereas, in these cases, the processing should
be governed by the law of the Member State in which the means used are located,
and there should be guarantees to ensure that the rights and obligations
provided for in this Directive are respected in practice;<p>
<p>
Whereas this Directive is without prejudice to the rules of territoriality
applicable in criminal matters;<p>
<p>
Whereas Member States shall more precisely define in the laws they enact or
when bringing into force the measures taken under this Directive, the general
circumstances in which processing is lawful; whereas in particular Article 5,
in conjunction with Articles 7 and 8, allows Member States, independently of
general rules, to provide for special processing conditions for specific
sectors and for the various categories of data covered by Article 8;<p>
<p>
Whereas Member States are empowered to ensure the implementation of the
protection of individuals both by means of a general law on the protection of
individuals against the processing of personal data and by sectorial laws such
as those relating, for example, to Institutes for Statistics;<p>
<p>
Whereas the legislation concerning the protection of legal persons with regard
to the processing of data which concern them is not affected by this
Directive;<p>
<p>
Whereas the principles of protection must be reflected, on the one hand, in the
obligations imposed on persons, public authorities, enterprises, agencies or
other bodies responsible for processing, in particular regarding data quality,
technical security, notification to the supervisory authority, and the
circumstances under which processing can be carried out, and, on the other
hand, in the rights conferred on individuals, the data on whom are the subject
of processing, to be informed that processing is taking place, to consult the
data, to request corrections and even to object to processing in certain
circumstances;<p>
<p>
Whereas the principles of protection must apply to any information concerning
an identified or identifiable person; whereas, to determine whether a person is
identifiable, account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be
used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said
person; whereas the principles of protection shall not apply to data rendered
anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable;
whereas codes of conduct within the meaning of Article 27 may be a useful
instrument in providing guidance as to the way in which data may be rendered
anonymous and retained in a form in which identification of the data subject is
no longer possible; <p>
<p>
Whereas the protection of individuals must apply as much to automatic
processing of data as to manual processing; whereas the scope of this
protection must not in effect depend on the techniques used, otherwise this
would create a serious risk of circumvention; whereas, nonetheless, as regards
manual processing, this Directive covers only filing systems, not according to
specific criteria relating to individuals allowing easy access to the personal
data; whereas, in line with the definition in Article 2(c) the different
criteria for determining the constituents of a structured set of personal data,
and the different criteria governing access to such a set, can be laid down by
each Member State; whereas files or sets of files as well as their cover pages,
which are not structured according to specific criteria, shall under no
circumstances fall within the scope of this Directive;<p>
<p>
Whereas any processing of personal data must be lawful and fair to the
individual concerned; whereas, in particular, the data must be adequate,
relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed; whereas such purposes must be explicit and legitimate and must be
determined at the time of collection of the data; whereas the purposes of
processing further to collection shall not be incompatible with the purposes as
they were originally specified;<p>
<p>
Whereas the further processing of personal data for historical, statistical, or
scientific purposes is not generally to be considered incompatible with the
purposes for which the data have previously been collected provided that Member
States furnish suitable guarantees; whereas these guarantees must in particular
rule out the use of data for taking measures or decisions regarding any
particular individual;<p>
<p>
Whereas, in order to be lawful, the processing of personal data must in
addition be carried out with the consent of the data subject or be necessary
with a view to the conclusion or performance of a contract binding on the data
subject, or be required by law, by the performance of a task in the public
interest or in the exercise of official authority, or by the interest of a
natural or legal person provided that the interests or the rights and freedoms
of the data subject are not overriding; whereas, in particular, in order to
maintain a balance between the interests involved while guaranteeing effective
competition, Member States remain free to determine the circumstances in which
personal data may be used or disclosed to a third party in the context of the
legitimate ordinary business activities of companies and other bodies; whereas
Member States may similarly specify the conditions under which personal data
may be disclosed to a third party for the purposes of marketing whether carried
out commercially or b a charitable organization or by any other association or
foundation, of a political nature for example, subject to the provisions
allowing a data subject to object to the processing of data regarding him, at
no cost and without having to state his reasons;<p>
<p>
Whereas the processing of personal data must equally be regarded as lawful
where it is carried out in order to protect an interest which is essential for
the data subject's life;<p>
<p>
Whereas it is for national legislation to determine whether the controller
performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
official authority should be a public administration or another national or
legal person governed by public law or by private law or such as a professional
association;<p>
<p>
Whereas data which are capable by their nature of infringing fundamental
freedoms or privacy should not be processed unless the data subject gives his
explicit consent; whereas, however, derogation from this prohibition must be
explicitly provided for in respect of specific needs, in particular where the
processing of these data is carried out for certain health-related purposes by
individuals subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy or in the
course of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the
purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms;<p>
<p>
Whereas Member States must Also be authorized, when justified by grounds of
important public interest, to derogate from the prohibition on processing
sensitive categories of data where important reasons of public interest so
justify in areas such as public health and social protection, especially as
regards the assurance of quality and cost-effectiveness, and as regards the
procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the health
insurance system, scientific research and government statistics; whereas it is
incumbent on them, however, to provide specific and suitable safeguards so as
to protect the fundamental rights and the privacy of individuals;<p>
<p>
Whereas, moreover, the processing of personal data by official authorities for
achieving aims, laid down in constitutional law or international public law, of
officially recognized religious associations is carried out on important
grounds of public interest;<p>
<p>
Whereas where, in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the
democratic system requires in certain Member States that political parties
compile data on people's political opinions, the processing of such data can be
permitted for reasons of important public interest, provided that appropriate
safeguards are established; <p>
<p>
Whereas the processing of personal data for purposes of journalism or for
purposes of literary or artistic expression, in particular in the audiovisual
field, should qualify for exemption from the requirements of certain provisions
of this Directive insofar as this is necessary to reconcile the fundamental
rights of individuals with freedom of information and notably the right to
receive and impart information, as guaranteed in particular in Article 10 of
the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms; whereas Member States should therefore lay down exemptions and
derogations necessary for the purposes of balance between fundamental rights as
regards general measures on the legitimacy of data processing, measures on the
transfer of data to third countries and the powers of supervisory authority;
whereas this should not, however, lead Member States to lay down exemptions
from the measures to ensure security of processing; whereas the supervisory
authority responsible for this sector should also be provided at least with
certain ex-post powers, e.g. to publish a regular report or to refer matters to
the judicial authorities; <p>
<p>
Whereas, if the processing of data is to be fair, the data subject must be in a
position to learn of the existence of a processing operation and, where data
are collected from him, must be given accurate and full information, bearing in
mind the circumstances of the collection;<p>
<p>
Whereas certain processing operations involve data which the controller has not
collected directly from the data subject; whereas, furthermore, data can be
legitimately disclosed to a third party, even if the disclosure was not
anticipated at the time the data were collected from the data subject; whereas,
in all these cases, the data subject should be informed when the data are
recorded  or at the latest when the data are first disclosed to a third
party;<p>
<p>
Whereas, however, it is not necessary to impose this obligation if the data
subject already knows the information; whereas, moreover, this obligation is
not provided for if the recording or disclosure are expressly provided for by
law or if the provision of information proves impossible or involved
disproportionate efforts, which could be the case where processing is for
historical, statistical or scientific purposes; whereas, in this regard, the
number of data subjects, the age of the data, and any compensatory measures
adopted may be taken into consideration;<p>
<p>
Whereas any person must be able to exercise the right of access to data
relating to him which are being processed, in order to verify in particular the
accuracy of the data and the lawfulness of the processing; whereas, for the
same reasons, every data subject must also have the right to know the logic
involved in the automatic processing of data concerning him, at least in the
case of the automated decisions referred to in Article 15(1); whereas this
right must not be adversely affect business confidentiality or intellectual
property and in particular the copyright protecting the software; whereas these
considerations must not, however, result in the data subject being refused all
information;<p>
<p>
Whereas Member States may, in the interest of the data subject or so as to
protect the rights and freedoms of others, restrict rights of access and
information; whereas they may, for example, specify that access to medical data
may be obtained only through a health professional;<p>
<p>
Whereas restrictions on the rights of access and information and on certain
obligations of the controller may similarly be imposed by Member States insofar
as they are necessary to safeguard, for example, national security, defence,
public safety, or important economic or financial interests of a Member State
or the Union, as well as criminal investigations and prosecutions and action in
respect of breaches of ethics in the regulated professions; whereas the list of
exceptions and limitations should include the tasks of monitoring, inspection
or regulation necessary in three last-mentioned areas concerning public
security, economic or financial interests and crime prevention; whereas the
listing of tasks in these three areas does not affect the legitimacy of
exceptions or restrictions for reasons of State security or defence;<p>
Whereas Member States may also be led, by virtue of the provisions of Community
law, to derogate from the provisions of this Directive concerning the right of
access, the obligation to inform individuals and the quality of data, in order
to safeguard certain purposes among those referred to above;<p>
<p>
Whereas, in cases of processing lawfully data pursued on grounds of public
interest, official authority or the legitimate interests of a natural or legal
person, any data subject should nevertheless be entitled, on legitimate and
compelling grounds relating to his particular situation, to object to the
processing of any data relating to himself; whereas Member States nevertheless
have the possibility of laying down national provisions to the contrary;<p>
<p>
Whereas the protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects with regard
to the processing of personal data requires that appropriate technical and
organizational measures be taken, both at the time of the design of the
processing system and at the time of the processing itself, particularly in
order to maintain security and thereby to prevent any unauthorized processing;
whereas it is incumbent on the Member States to ensure that controllers comply
with these measures; whereas these measures must ensure an appropriate level of
security, taking into account the state of the technology and the cost of its
use in view of the risks inherent in the processing and the nature of the data
to be protected;<p>
<p>
Whereas where a message containing personal data is transmitted by means of a
telecommunications or electronic mail service, the sole purpose of which is the
transmission of such messages, the controller in respect of the personal data
contained in the message will normally be considered to be the person from whom
the message originates, rather than the person offering the transmission
services; whereas, nevertheless, those offering such services will normally be
considered controllers in respect of the processing of the additional personal
data necessary for the operation of the service;<p>
<p>
Whereas the notification procedures are designed to ensure disclosure of the
purposes and main features of any processing operation for the purpose of
verification that the operation is in accordance with the national measures
taken under this Directive;<p>
<p>
Whereas, in order to avoid unsuitable administrative formalities, exemptions
from the obligation to notify and simplification of the notification required
may be provided for by Member States in cases where processing is unlikely to
adversely affect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, provided that it is
in accordance with a measure taken by a Member State specifying its limits;
whereas in an equivalent way exemption or simplification can similarly be
provided for by Member States where a person appointed by the controller
ensures that the processing carried out is not likely adversely to affect the
rights and freedoms of data subjects; whereas such an official, whether or not
an employee of the controller, must be in a position to exercise his functions
in complete independence;<p>
<p>
Whereas exemption or simplification could be provided for in cases of
processing operations whose sole purpose is the keeping of a register intended,
according to national law, to provide information to the public and open to
consultation by the public or by any person demonstrating a legitimate
interest;<p>
<p>
Whereas, nevertheless, simplification or exemption from the obligation to
notify shall not release the controller from any of the other obligations
resulting from this Directive;<p>
<p>
Whereas, in this context, ex post facto verification by the competent
authorities must be in general be considered a sufficient measure;<p>
<p>
Whereas, however, certain processing operations are likely to pose specific
risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects by virtue of their nature,
their scope or their purposes, such as the purpose of excluding individuals
from a right, benefit or contract, or by virtue of the specific use of new
technologies; whereas it is for Member States, if they so wish, to specify such
risks in their legislation;<p>
<p>
Whereas with regard to all the processing undertaken in society, the amount
posing such specific risks should be very limited; whereas Member States must
provide that the supervisory authority, or the data protection official in
cooperation with the authority, check such processing prior to it being carried
out; whereas following this prior check, the supervisory authority may,
according to its national law, give an opinion or an authorization regarding
the processing; whereas such checking may equally take place in the course of
the preparation of a legislative measure adopted by the national parliament or
on the basis of such a measure, defining the nature of the processing and
specifying suitable safeguards;<p>
<p>
Whereas, if the controller fails to respect the rights of data subjects,
national legislation must provide for a judicial remedy; whereas any damage
which a person may suffer as a result of unlawful processing must be
compensated for by the controller, who may be exempted from liability if he
proves that he is not responsible for the damage, in particular in cases where
he reports an error on the part of the data subject or in a case of force
majeure; whereas sanctions must be imposed on any person, whether governed by
private or public law, who fails to comply with the national measures taken
under this Directive;<p>
<p>
Whereas cross-border flows of personal data are necessary to the expansion of
international trade; whereas the protection of individuals guaranteed in the
Community by this Directive does not stand in the way of transfers of personal
data to third countries which ensure an adequate level of protection; whereas
the adequacy of the level of protection afforded by a third country must be
assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding the transfer
operation or set of transfer operations;<p>
<p>
Whereas, on the other hand, the transfer of personal data to a third country
which does not ensure an adequate level of protection must be prohibited;<p>
<p>
Whereas provision should be made for exemptions from this prohibition in
certain circumstances where the data subject has given his consent, where the
transfer is necessary in relation to a contract or a legal claim, where
protection of an important public interest so requires, for example in cases of
international transfers of data between tax or customs administrations or
between services competent for social security matters, or where the transfer
is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by the
public or persons having a legitimate interest; whereas in this case such a
transfer should not involve the entirety of the data or entire categories of
the data contained in the register and, when the register is intended for
consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer should be
made only at the request of the same persons or if the latter are the
recipients;<p>
<p>
Whereas particular measures may be taken to compensate for the lack of
protection in a third country in cases where the person responsible for the
processing offers appropriate assurances; whereas, moreover, provision must be
made for procedures for negotiations between the Community and such third
countries;<p>
<p>
Whereas, in any event, transfers to third countries may only be effected in
full compliance with the provisions adopted by the Member States pursuant to
this Directive, and in particular Article 8 thereof;<p>
<p>
Whereas Member States and the Commission, in their respective spheres of
competence, must encourage the trade associations and other representative
organizations concerned to draw up codes of conduct so far as to facilitate the
application of this Directive, taking account of the specific characteristics
of the processing carried out in certain sectors, and respecting the national
provisions adopted for its implementation;<p>
<p>
Whereas the establishment in Member States of supervisory authorities,
exercising their functions with complete independence, is an essential
component of the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of
personal data;<p>
<p>
Whereas such authorities must have the necessary means to perform their duties,
including powers of investigation and intervention, particularly in cases of
complaints from individuals, and powers to engage in legal proceedings; whereas
such authorities must help to ensure transparency of processing in the Member
States within those jurisdiction they fall;<p>
<p>
Whereas the authorities in the different Member States will need to assist one
another in performing their duties so as to ensure that the rules of protection
are properly respected throughout the European Union;<p>
<p>
Whereas, at Community level, a Working Party on the Protection of Individuals
with regard to the Processing of Personal Data must be set up and be completely
independent in the performance of its functions; whereas, having regard to its
specific nature, it must advise the Commission and, in particular, contribute
to the uniform application of the national rules adopted pursuant to this
Directive;<p>
<p>
Whereas, with regard to the transfer of data to third countries, the
application of this Directive calls for the conferment of powers of
implementation on the Commission and the establishment of a procedure in
accordance with the procedures laid down in Council Decision 87/373/EEC(1)<p>
<p>
Whereas the principles set out in this Directive regarding the protection of
the rights and freedoms of individuals, notably their right to privacy, with
regard to the processing of personal data may be supplemented or clarified, in
particular as far as certain sectors are concerned, by specific rules based on
those principles; <p>
<p>
Whereas Member States should be allowed a period of not more than three years
from the entry into force of the national measures transposing this Directive
in which to apply such new national rules gradually to all processing
operations already under way; whereas, in order to facilitate cost-efficient
implementation, a further period expiring twelve years after the date on which
this Directive is adopted will be allowed to Member States to ensure the
conformity of existing manual filing systems with certain of the Directive's
provisions; whereas data contained in such filing systems actively processed
during this extended transition period should nevertheless be brought into
conformity with these provisions at the time of such further active processing;
Whereas an agreement on a "modus vivendi" between the European Parliament, the
Council and the Commission concerning the implimenting measures for acts
adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the EC
Treaty was reached on 20 December 1994,<p>
<p>
Whereas it is not necessary for the data subject to give his consent again so
as to allow the controller to continue to process, after the national
provisions taken pursuant to this Directive enter into force, any sensitive
data necessary for the performance of a contract concluded on the basis of free
and informed consent before the entry into force of these provisions;<p>

Whereas this Directive does not stand in the way of a Member State's regulating
marketing activities aimed at consumers residing in its territory insofar as
much as such regulation does not concern the protection of individuals with
regard to the processing of personal data;<p>

documents to be taken into account when implementing the principles set out in
this Directive,<p>

transfer may take place only if, without prejudice to compliance with the
national provisions adopted pursuant to the other provisions of this Directive,
the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection.<p>
<p>
2. The adequacy of the level of protection afforded by a third country shall be
assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer
operation or set of data transfer operations; particular consideration shall be
given to the nature of the data, the purpose and duration of the proposed
processing operation or operations, the country of origin and country of final
destination, the rules of law, both general and sectoral, in force in the third
country in question and the professional rules and security measures which are
complied with in those countries.<p>

<b>Article 26  Derogations</b><p>
<b></b><p>
1. By way of derogation from Article 25 and save where otherwise provided by
domestic law governing particular cases, Member States shall provide that a
transfer or a set of transfers of personal data to a third country which does
not ensure an adequate level of protection within the meaning of Article 25(2)
may take place on condition that:<p>
<p>
1) the data subject has given his consent unambiguously to the proposed
transfer, or<p>
<p>
2) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data
subject and the controller or the implementation of precontractual measures
taken in response to the data subject's request, or<p>
<p>
3) the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or for the performance of a
contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller
and a third party, or<p>
<p>
4) the transfer is necessary or legally required on important public interest
grounds, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or<p>
<p>
5) the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the
data subject, or<p>
<p>
6) the transfer is made from a register which according to laws or regulations
is intended to provide information to the public and which is open to
consultation either by the public in general or by any person who can
demonstrate legitimate interest, to the extent that the conditions laid down in
law for consultation are fulfilled in the particular case.<p>
2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, a Member State may authorize a transfer or
a set of transfers of personal data to a third country which does not ensure an
adequate level of protection within the meaning of Article 25(2), where the
controller adduces sufficient guarantees with respect to the protection of the
privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and as regards the
exercise of the corresponding rights; such guarantees may in particular result
from appropriate contractual clauses.<p>
<p>
3. The Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of
the authorizations granted pursuant to paragraph 2.<p>

<font size=+2>S</font>etting your default hompage is easy in Netscape. Simply go through the following steps and then Netscape will startup with your new custom homepage, giving you quick access to great links, great software, great search tools, and much, much more.<br>

<ul>
<li>Click the <i>Options</i> menu choose <i>General Preferences...</i>
<li>Click the <i>Appearance</i> tab
<li>Change the <i>Startup</i> textbox so it reads <b>http://www.compulinks.com/</b>
<li>Click the <i>OK</i> button
</ul>

<font size=+2>T</font>hat's it! Next time you start Netscape, you'll go directly to your custom homepage. (You can also get "home" quickly by pressing the Netscape <i>Home</i> button on the toolbar - try it now!). <p>

The Canadian markets are doing well, driven by lower rates and an improved international perception of our economy. Be cautious that the markets are becoming overbought. Natural resources funds are being held up by Oil and Gas and by Forest Products. Metals are near to making a significant breakout to higher levels. Gold bullion is weakening despite being oversold. The TSE Gold Index is doing relatively better<p>BONDS.  Canadian bonds are doing very well, despite a somewhat weaker $Cdn.<p>US.  The Dow is above my 6200-6400 target zone but may still go higher. The US Dollar is very strong presently, and might help to lower US interest rates.<p>INTERNATIONAL.  The world markets are a buy. Europe is getting ahead of itself. Hold off on further purchases. Still NO for Japan but rest of S.E. Asia looks pretty good. Latin funds are marginally positive. Hold what you've got. Add more later. </td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="canada.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/home.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>332</center></body></html>

Interest rates are really low, we are paying off our national debts, the stock market is booming and the unemployment rate is 8 to 11 percent!<p>For the past month Canadian market sectors dominated my International Index List. In the 12 sectors that make up the top quartile of the list, only the Paris Bourse and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are present among the Canuck stuff. Top indices were Real Estate (!!), TSE Financials (mostly the banks), the blue chip TSE 35 and the Oil and Gas index. Hardly anything Canadian is in the bottom half of the table. The group that is getting the most attention these days is the banking sector. Roaring ever higher as rates fall and profitability rises, the bank bashers are emerging in force. Wow, a billion dollar profit?! I wonder what that means as Return On Equity??? In percentage terms, it's probably nowhere near as much as we'd all like from an investment.<p>While I remain bullish on Canada, There is a definite sense of optimism among investors and that should be a caution to you all. This happy little game will not go on forever. Go read<i> "Contrarion Investment Strategy"</i>  by David Dreman. Published about 20 years ago, and generally available in the public library system, Dreman's book shows the wisdom of not following the crowd. He has a perfect little chart that shows that <i>extreme</i> levels of optimism occour at market tops. Those figures are gleaned from weekly sentiment surveys of market pro's opinions. While these people are not fools, the emotional factors in the markets affect even the best of us. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse300.gif">TSE 300<p></a><a href="charts/tse35.gif">TSE 35<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="natres.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>105</center></body></html>

<html><head><title>The Informed Investor Newsletter - Natural Resource Funds</title></head><body background="../images/tile.gif" bgcolor=#ffffff link=#297b63 vlink=#297b63 alink=#31ad84><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/home.gif" width=55 height=16 align=right border=0 alt="Home" vspace=5 hspace=5></a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <img src="../titles/natres.gif"><p><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6><tr><td><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2></td><td><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/i.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>n the greater scheme of things, but particularly in the Canadian equity markets, I believe that the natural resource sector will eventually be hailed as the darling of the investment world. That is somewhere ahead of us of course, but we don't want to wait and be buying the "darlings," do we? We want to be <i>selling</i> the "darlings" to those who don't know any better.<p>Again, the TSE 100 Resource Index is giving a solid performance. Gradually, the various natural resources sectors are combining to provide a more equal share of market power. If you recall, at the end of August I told you about a technical breakout in the Oil and Gas sector, projecting a 28% move to 6800 pt. We are only a couple of percent short of this initial target and may see higher values yet. The TSE Metals index is almost at 5800 pt. On a breakout <i>above </i>5800, the Metals Index projects a move to 6600 or 15% gain. During the Spring, I marked The Paper and Forest Products chart with the message "cycle lows." Since then a slow but steady continuing investment recovery has helped natural resource fund portfolios. So what's left out from this happy little picture? Gold.<p>London Gold bullion prices have now sagged down through my Stop point and I have to rate bullion as a Sell. The TSE Gold Index has fared better. TSE Gold Index,  having made three intermediate term lows in the past year, has each low higher than the previous, indicating a modest uptrend. While there may be a number of reasons for this behaviour, the best one is the split personality of the Canadian gold sector. If you invest in a company engaged in <i>exploration,</i> you have probably made money. If your funds are in a gold <i>processing</i> company, lower bullion prices will have reduced profitability and share prices. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse100re.gif">TSE Resource<p></a><a href="charts/londongo.gif">London Gold<p></a><a href="charts/tsegold.gif">TSE Gold<p></a><a href="charts/tseoilan.gif">TSE Oil/Gas<p></a><a href="charts/tsemetal.gif">TSE Metal<p></a><a href="charts/tsepaper.gif">TSE Paper<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="canada.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>62</center></body></html>

We are now up  by about 15% since our bond buy signal in the May issue. You shoulda been in the Canadian equity market, you say!!? You could have also bought GIC's and have earned about 2% over the same time. Incidentally, research people at the Royal Bank just reported that even GIC's are actually paying a very good "real rate of return."  Real rate of return is the difference between the inflation rate and the actual return on the GIC. Royal thinks people shouldn't feel bad about the apparent poor performance.<p>The Royal Bank should know better. Although they're dead right, you'll never persuade a rate-shocked retiree that all's well. The last time I tried to explain this very point to a senior was years ago. I thought that she was going to hit me.<p>The Canadian bond market is moving to new all time highs. How far will it go? As usual, it's hard to say, but there's huge <i>potential</i> still ahead. The God of Bond Traders will tell you that when any market moves to new all-time highs, there is normally more positive action ahead. One caveat here is that this rally is has gone farther than any other intermediate term rally over the last five years. As always, be careful out there.<p>Several important Intermarket factors come into play. Firstly, the US bond market is trying to catch up. Our 10 year T Bond index shows yields of about 6% with the potential to fall to about 5.5% so there's probably a little room left for higher bond prices. The US Dollar is stronger too, another positive for higher US bond prices. Note that in Canada, our Dollar did not breakout through 75 ct. and has lost ground. Several newspapers quickly blamed the Bank of Canada. However the change factor was from outside Canada and was the US Dollar, because both the DM and the Yen lost ground, too. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/10yrustb.gif">10 Yr.

The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is strongest, the S&P 500 is next. The broadly based NY Composite is third and finally the Nasdaq brings up the rear. From this arrangement it seems that the blue chip stocks have a lions share of the market action. Incidentally, in Canada the blue chip TSE 35 is also doing better than the TSE 300.<p>The Dow has passed my original target of 6200-6400 and appears to want to keep moving higher. As stated several times in the past (and is being repeated by everybody), rising interest rates are probably a key to a market reversal. However, investors are continually hearing that the US economy is slowing to more modest growth rates. If this turns out to be true, then the Federal Reserve may not need to raise rates to slow the economy. Let's hope that this is the way that it works. I'm still concerned about a correction in sometime in the late winter. However, with a stronger US Dollar, foreign money will continue to invest in the US, The Fed. will be less concerned about cutting rates and the pot can stay boiling for a while longer. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/dowjones.gif">Dow Jones<p></a><a href="charts/nasdaq.gif">NASDAQ<p></a><a href="charts/cboebiot.gif">CBOE Biotech<p></a><a href="charts/sp500.gif">S & P 500<p></a><a href="charts/nycompas.gif">NY Composite<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="inter.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>37</center></body></html>

The TSE 300 has finally been driven down to a level from which an intermediate term rally is possible. The key to spotting the start of such a rally rests with the major US and World indices. The Canadian markets should follow along.<p>BONDS. US bond yields above 7.5% may trigger a serious correction. However, at 7% now bearish momentum might be waning. In Canada, I have recommended a bond buy two months ago. The Canadian economy is much weaker than our neighbours to the south. My Canadian bond benchmark is the Government of Canada bonds of 2011, with $106.00 as a Stop point.<p>US. Despite some seemingly scary selloffs in the last couple of weeks, some market reversal signals have been seen. Most US indices are now oversold.<p>INTERNATIONAL. International funds are in a correction phase. Europe is correcting but looks to be in better shape than other regions. Japan is still struggling with the four year long price ceiling at 21,000 to 22,000 on the Nikkei. Hong Kong is going sideways. Latin markets appear to be correcting along with the US, but are one of the better performing regions. </td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="canada.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/home.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>229</center></body></html>

After the debacle of the Vancouver junior venture stocks over this past month, the TSE 300 has also gone through a 5 % correction. The TSE is nearing a level that could prompt an intermediate term rally. TSE Golds, Forest Products and the TSE Resources 100 indexes are in similar positions, suggesting that a natural resource rally is also possible over the next few weeks.<p>BONDS. The surprisingly low US unemployment rate on July 5th. was bad for the US bond market. My yield target is 7% to 7.5% yield on longer term bonds. Yields above 7.5% could trigger a major stock market correction. In Canada the economy is weaker, with unemployment rates rising<D>. I recommended buying bonds last month. Use $106.00 on the benchmark Govt. of Canada bonds of 2011 as a Stop point. <p>US. Despite the recent 114 point selloff in the Dow Jones Industrial Averages, the Dow is within a trading range and major US indices are slowly getting oversold.<p>INTERNATIONAL. General international funds are just starting to lag this month. Europe is a buy. Japan has yet to  break its four year price ceiling. The buy point remains at 22,800. Hong Kong still looks positive for my 12,500 point target. I recommended buying Latin American funds last month, but no clear results have emerged yet. </td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="canada.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/home.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>237</center></body></html>

A banana republic no more, we can bask in the warmth of fiscal restraint. The warm glow that comes from lower inflation, fiscal restraint, good growth and export potential. Several recent economics reports from Canadian banks point to better times ahead.<p>The Bank of Montreal (yes, I think that their "times they are a'changing" ads are great)! have issued a recent report that predicts a great year for 1997. Despite the aforementioned strong growth, Canadian industry has the excess industrial capacity to handle the expansion, without triggering higher inflation. The Bank of Montreal also expects lower interest rates from the Bank of Canada and therefore, good bond markets. The economists at Scotiabank expect that Canadian growth rates will lead the G-7 nations in 1997 and we will achieve this with one of the lowest inflation rates of all industrialized nations.<p>By the way, check out the <a href="charts/usvscdn.gif">Canandian dollar chart</a>. We're up to about 75cts.,with the potential of getting to about 78-79 cts.<p>Over the past month, Canadian sub-indices have been reflecting the World's new high opinion of Canada. My list of 48 International and domestic indices and sub-indices places 10 Canadian sub-indices in the top (12 market) quartile. The only International indices to make the top list were Madrid and Hong Kong. The best performing Canadian sub-indices for the past month are Real Estate, Financials (especially Banking), Communications, Transportation and the Oil and Gas Index. For the rest of our natural resource investments, things are much as they were last month. Paper and Forests are showing improvement after making cycle lows between March and August. Metals are dragging and Gold appears to be losing value, although it may pay investors to watch the action of bullion prices. The London Gold chart shows that gold is very oversold, as investors look at other apparently fertile fields. When an investment sector hits the bottom everybody is invariably looking elsewhere, so it might be worthwhile to post a note to keep checking on Gold bullion prices. The worst performers for the past month are Golds, Consumer Products, Metals and Industrial Products.<p>The TSE 300 is powering along at over 5700 and is really overbought. But who will stand in the path of a moving train and go against the rising tide at this point? Traders' rules say "Always go with the trend." Overbought markets can accelerate in the direction of the major trend for quite a while. All we can do is go along for the ride for the time being. Will the markets end in a crash as many of the "bears" have predicted? I'm not the one to tell you. The "bears" have been wrong to date and strong markets generally don't turn on a dime. In the "Crash of '87" the markets topped out nearly two months before October 19th and the August 28th high was about 15% above the Dow on October 19th. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse300.gif">TSE 300<p></a><a href="charts/tse100re.gif">TSE Resource<p></a><a href="charts/londongo.gif">London Gold<p></a><a href="charts/tsegoldi.gif">TSE Gold<p></a><a href="charts/tsemetal.gif">TSE Metal<p></a><a href="charts/tsepaper.gif">TSE Paper<p></a><a href="charts/tseoilan.gif">TSE Oil/Gas<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="mutual.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>95</center></body></html>

My, what a difference  a couple of years makes, eh?<p>Canadian bond prices are up about 12% since I recommended a bond buy in late June. Canadian bond prices are now moving to new all time highs. Many GIC customers are suffering from the nastiest case of "Rate Shock" in a generation,  since interest rates are now the lowest in 30 years. Of course, on the other side of the fence, consumers are getting the cheapest long term mortgage rates in 30 years too. I'd have to say that we are <i>probably </i>heading into the bottoming phase of the 50 to 60 year Kondratieff Wave cycle. Looking back the (Kondratieff) economic peak was in 1980. You might remember those days: $800 per oz. for gold. I remember borrowing some house fixup money at 21.5%. Canada Savings Bonds were 19.5% that year and many investors expected even higher rates. Why am I rambling? Well, in 1980, no one had a clue where the economic peak was. Now it's as clear as day. Have rates hit the bottom? Or can we go even lower? Ask me in a few year's time. One clue might be that the Federal Reserve has done the job yet again and accommodated the Incumbent President-a strategy that we've been playing for many months. Unfortunately, the honeymoon may be over within a few months. Rising US short term rates might tip us off that we're heading for trouble. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/10yrustb.gif">10 Yr.

The US Presidential Elections are over, with incumbent President Clinton winning by a substantial margin. The US markets have rocketed in the last couple of days, showing that the World's investors have embraced a Democrat President and a Republican Congress, the first re-elected Republican Congress since 1930. Unfortunately, voter turn out was the lowest in 72 years, speaking volumes for the perceived qualities of the candidates. 55% of polled voters said that they did not consider Mr. Clinton to be "trustworthy."<p>In late July, I directed you to two "market reversal day" signals and commented that the market was oversold and ripe for a multi-month rally. Well, we're here. Now that many more investors now believe that it's a great market, it's time to get cagey, not complacent. Enjoy the rally while we've got it, <i>the trend is your friend</i>, but remember, the honeymoon always ends sometime.<p>My expectations from four months ago were for better performance from biotechnology and Nasdaq high tech stocks. Unfortunately, some Biotech stocks have lagged a bit, but high tech., plus the NYA, S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average have done equally well since. The Dow has reached into my target zone of 6200-6400 points mentioned in the September letter, but as said then, it may go higher. I wish that I had the skill to tell you when to bail out. Personally, I'm going to stay with the trend for as long as I dare. US stock market historian Yale Hirsch says that a re-elected President usually spells trouble for the stock market, especially if the markets were very strong before the Presidential Election. Yale says that after re-election the markets have fallen by an average of 11% with the worst drops down to about 20%. exception and had a bull market to support him?

I remain bullish on Canadian markets but, presently, we don't have the powerful market influence of the natural resources sectors to boost prices. Also, the TSE 300 chart shows that the market is at the top of the multi-year trading channel, which tends to put a brake on any rapidly accelerating rally. More likely action calls for the TSE 300 to climb the trendline for a while, especially if the US markets continue with their recent powerful rally. That's not necessarily a negative. It may give us time to ponder the market action over the next few months, rather than overreacting to it.<p>For yet another month, Canadian markets are doing well on the international stage. On a month over month basis, my 50 international indices and sub indices are led by Canadian groups. TSE Transports (thanks to Laidlaw) lead followed by very strong action by the TSE Consumer Prods. Index, mostly because of funeral home takeover candidate Loewen Group. I said it fifteen years ago and, unfortunately for you, I'll say it again. Funeral homes are a good long term investment. Just buy 'em when nobody wants them, that's all. We'll all die, someday. This is a smart way to follow demographer David Foot's (of "Boom Bust and Echo") advice, but just wait until everybody else forgets about demographics. The TSE Financial/Banking index is next. Canadian banks are <i>hot, </i>but getting overdone. The Real Estate Index and the<i> </i>Merchandising Index followed, with the TSE Oil and Gas and TSE Utilities a little behind.<p>The Canadian markets seem hot. Of the twelve international indices in the top quartile ranking eight are Canadian! However the Canadian markets appear to be segmented. There is lots of action only if you are in the right Canadian sectors. Despite the hot dog performance of nearly half of the Canadian sectors, the TSE 300 Index can only score in the middle of the pack. True to form, some Canadian groups also are the significant worst performers this month. Although results were only marginally negative, the natural resources groups (excluding the Oil index) were at the bottom of the list. Natural resources are still in a strong intermediate term uptrend but showing weakness on the shorter term. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse300.gif">TSE 300<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="natres.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>191</center></body></html>

Most recently, the International Monetary Fund has announced that, beginning in 1997, the IMF will sell 500,000 oz. of gold per month for most of that year. The funds are being used to ease the debts of up to forty heavily impoverished third world nations. The Germans object to the sales, pointing out that huge IMF debts still exist to Russia and Mexico. Also several Central Banks (Canada is right in there) have been unloading gold positions, already depressing the gold markets. Well, you guessed it, the IMF deal isn't good for precious metals funds. With a potentially high "supply" level waiting out there in 1997, it's going to take a lot of "demand" for gold to move prices a lot higher. Of course, the IMF deal is already built into gold bullion prices. A positive surprise for prices would happen if the Germans manage to marshall enough forces to defeat the proposal. The IMF need an 85% positive agreement to swing the deal.<p>As mentioned in the Canadian comment, natural resources sectors are bottom of the monthly index survey. However the TSE 100 Resources index is still operating in a solid uptrend, even if underperforming over the past few weeks. We've just covered the gold situation. The TSE Metals index has broken down and is now trading under the multi-year trading channel. That's a sign of weakness to traders and makes me cautious on this sector. The TSE Paper and Forest Products index has made cycle lows and is slowly recovering from a long price decline.<p>The leader among the natural resources sectors is the TSE Oil and Gas index. Technically the Oil and Gas index has the potential to move from the 5500 pt level to 6700-6800 pts. After oil prices were boosted by Saddam's attacks, prices fell back as rumours of large potential supplies of Saudi crude appeared. There is also a rumour in commodities circles that Mr. Clinton is trying to keep the price of oil down going into the Presidential Elections. I saw a great cartoon of Saddam dressed as a schoolboy, writing out his hundred line punishment: "I must not threaten US oil supplies in a Presidential Election year.. I must not threaten US oil suppl..." Finally, it could be a very cold winter, driving up energy prices again. Who sez? Why, the Old Farmers Almanac, of course. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse100re.gif">TSE Resource<p></a><a href="charts/tsegoldi.gif">TSE Gold<p></a><a href="charts/tsemetal.gif">TSE Metals<p></a><a href="charts/tsepaper.gif">TSE Paper<p></a><a href="charts/tseoilan.gif">TSE Oil/Gas<p></a><a href="charts/londongo.gif">London Gold<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="canada.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="mutual.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>121</center></body></html>

Global</b> are about to announce a new mutual fund class based upon G.T. Global's belief that investment potential exists in telecommunications, technology, healthcare, natural resources, financial services infrastructure and consumer products and services worldwide. There, that about covers everything! This looks like an encompassing hunt for international growth markets. The information was skimpy in this initial press release. Advisor roadshows started on September 30th. G.T. Global claim that this fund will be the first of its kind in Canada. If you like international growth and it certainly has possibilities over the next few months, ask your advisor to get you some information.<p><b>C.I. Fund</b> has recently hired fund whiz Jonathan Baird to run two new Canadian mutual funds. Mr. Baird, who left <b>Dynamic Funds</b> about one year ago, has done a really good job of generating results for<b> University Avenue Funds</b>. As an independent manager, he will be retained by both <b>University Avenue</b> and <b>C.I</b>. Baird, in my opinion, is one of the few "Star" managers who have recently moved to new funds and have lived up to their reputations as hot fund managers.<p><b>University Avenue Funds</b>, long an advocate of direct, no-load selling, have decided to offer their funds through investment advisors. Advisors may charge up to three percent sales charge, with no deferred load option available. Advisors will receive a trailer fee of one percent per year. Most of <b>University Avenue's</b> thirty-five million dollar assets are in the <b>University Avenue Canadian Fund</b>, managed by Jonathan Baird.<p><b>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</b>, who have been one of the poorer performers out of the bank mutual fund groups, are working to put some zip into their fund performance by utilizing three <b>Talvest</b> investment managers to run <b>CIBC funds</b>. The three managers will run CIBC's $280 million <b>Capital Appreciation Fund</b>. The fund invests in small to mid cap Canadian stocks. Paul Wong will pick resource stocks, Stephen Kahn will pick overseas stocks and Paul Barnard will pick small industrial and technology stocks.<p>CIBC will climb on the Demographics bandwagon by offering the <b>CIBC North American Demographics Fund</b>, which will be managed by Ken Woods of <b>Talvest.</b> <b>Talvest Investment Counsel</b> is a subsidiary of <b>CIBC.<p></b>Personal trading by mutual fund managers has become a hot topic in recent weeks. Following US scandals, the Canadian fund industry seems to be heading towards tougher rules to govern manager trading. <b>Altamira,</b> strung by accusations that star manager Frank Mersch may have violated ethics by tipping a friend to buy <b>Diamond Fields</b> in the early stages of its rocket like-growth, have stipulated that Altamira managers and families may only buy Altamira funds for personal investment purposes. Other firms follow the Association for Investment Management and Research (AIMR) which has tough rules against personal trading and other conflict of interest issues. A few fund firms still have no policy regarding staff investment practices.<p>Canadian fund managers are by no means alone when it comes to fund manager scandals. Two prominent international fund management  companies, Morgan Grenfell Asset Management of England and Jardine Fleming of Hong Kong have both suffered at the hands of rogue "star" managers. Morgan Grenfell manager Peter Young covered up losses to the tune of about $400 million, while Jardine Fleming's Colin Armstrong diverted profitable trades to his own account, costing Jardine Fleming about $20 million in fines and penalties. Also, the proud international reputations of both firms have been damaged in the process. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>There are no<br>charts related<br>to this article.</font><p></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="natres.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font></center></body></html>

Watching as an investment strategy seems an absolute "mug's game." Yet famous Wall Streeters are reverently consulted by Barron's or The Wall Street Journal.<p>On a different note, a recent article about the opinions of <i>former</i> Federal Reserve Governors, the majority opinion was for no rate increases until after the Presidential elections. Although present Fed. Governors strenuously deny accommodating the incumbent President, past governors claim that the closeness of the elections will cause the Fed. to hold off raising rates. Several Fed. Alumni also mention that the US economy could well slow down of its own accord during the latter part of the year-<i>removing the need for higher interest rates</i>.<p>With a weaker economy than the US, there is more room for the Bank of Canada to lower Canadian interest rates and boost bond prices. Bonds have been a buy for three months now. Unfortunately, bond prices still haven't moved <i>enough</i> to give us a big pocketful of profits. It feels like a patience game for a while. US government bonds are starting to rally now. Maybe an increase in impetus on the US side will boost our bond prices.<p>I notice that a small rally in the Canadian dollar is under way. We are shedding our Banana Republic image. Hooray for provincial balanced budget plans! OOPS, but what are the Feds doing??<p>Our inflationary measures are lagging at the moment.

The Dow may go higher, but we will have to play along as the market moves higher. Although the Nasdaq index has yet to clear previous highs, it is moving at a faster rate than the other US indices. Still, the Nasdaq, Dow, S&P 500 and the NY Composite are all performing in the upper third of my fifty International indices and sub indices. The one holdout is Biotechnology, which is lagging at the moment.<p>The Investment Funds Institute (US) announced last week that the 6007 (!!) US mutual funds now had $3.12 billion in investment funds, about half in stock funds and about one quarter each in bond/income and money market funds. Mutual fund assets are now second in size to commercial banks but ahead of private pension fund assets. Fund growth over the past six months has been about thirteen percent. The Investment Funds Institute (US) estimates that fund assets have grown by 54% from new cash flow and 46% from price appreciation.<p>On a humorous note, prankster Michael Moore is having a go at greed among presidential candidates. His strategy is to mail small campaign donations from inappropriate-but fictitious-organizations to see which candidates put money before principle.<p>The Perot organization returned a $100 contribution from "Pedophiles for Free Trade". Clinton's campaign cashed a donation from "Hemp Growers of America," while Buchanan's campaign happily cashed a cheque from "Abortionists for Buchanan" in the belief (they said) that the practical jokester would be punished through his own pocketbook. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/dowjones.gif">Dow Jones<p></a><a href="charts/nasdaq.gif">NASDAQ<p></a><a href="charts/cboebiot.gif">CBOE Biotech<p></a><a href="charts/sp500.gif">SP 500<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="inter.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>70</center></body></html>

Both indices are now moving to new highs, no doubt spurred by the positive action in the US markets. My continuing recommendation is to buy World-based international funds from Trimark, Templeton, Saxon or Sceptre.<p>A UN economic report released last week indicated that the world economy is still growing, but a decelerating rate. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development went on to say that interest rates in Europe need to be lowered to stimulate job growth. According to the U.N., some Western European countries' unemployment rates were at levels not seen since the Great Depression and were at risk of getting worse. In contrast, the US has experienced one of the longest economic recoveries in postwar history. The strong economic growth of the Asian "Four Tigers"-Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore-should continue. For the past three decades these countries have averaged seven percent annual growth rate.<p>EUROPE. The Morgan Stanley Europe Index continues to move to new highs, after a little weakness over the summer. This action translates very well for the Euro-based international funds, which rank as four of the best ten International Best Funds based upon one year performance. At the moment, Europe represents one of the strongest investable regions in the World. Check out the Best Funds list for good European funds ranked by one year performance.<p>ASIA. It's still a resounding "NO" to a Japanese investment. As before, The Nikkei needs to get above 22,800 to demonstrate to investors that all the current selling pressure, that readily available supply of Japanese securities, has finally dried up. The Hong Kong and Singapore markets are starting to show some signs of life and have been rallying for the past few weeks. <p>LATIN AMERICA. The Latin markets are still operating in neutral. Some of my favourite funds are slightly higher, some slightly lower. The Mexican Bolsa is also in a neutral phase. If you are in, then hold for yet another month. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/europe.gif">Europe<p></a><a href="charts/morgstan.gif">E.

Four of the best eight of my international indices list are Canadian sub-indices. Three of those four are natural resources sectors: Golds, Paper/Forest Products and Metals/Mines. At the other end of the performance tables are Communications, Real Estate, Banking and Pipelines.<p>Part of the rally seems to come from lower Canadian interest rates creating rising Canadian bond prices. The converse situation in the US-the perception of a stronger economy pushing up international prices for raw materials, seems to help our natural resources investments.<p>I believe that we have begun an intermediate-term rally. However, I don't see strong evidence for a continued move well into 1997 because of US considerations. Add to your positions, but this is probably not the time for <i>outright highly leveraged</i> speculation. The natural resources component of the TSE should give the Canadian markets more power than the US at this late stage of the bull market.<p>Last month, I reported good economic news from various bank think-tanks. This month The Fraser Institute gave a failing grade to the Canadian government on its ability to control fiscal policy and to meet past budget predictions. While the Liberals have made some positive gains, the Institute ranks the Federal government tenth out of eleven for the combined Federal and Provincial governments for both 1995-96 and 1996-7. That's not a pretty picture. The top four provinces for 1996-97 are projected as Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta and Nova Scotia. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse300.gif">TSE 300<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="natres.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>104</center></body></html>

Looking at the chart of the TSE 100 Resources chart, the index has stayed in its trading channel, bounced off the bottom of the channel and is rapidly moving higher. The one natural resource sector that didn't show up on the relative strength rankings was the TSE Oil and Gas index. While apparently under performing for the last few weeks, the TSE Oil index has actually broken above the price ceiling at about 5300 points. This is an important move for professional investors and traders. They see such a move as an important signal that "supply" has been overcome by "demand" and indicates good odds that oil share prices are going higher. I have remained positive on natural resources for quite a while. This is a clear opportunity to add natural resource funds to your portfolio if you have not bought into this sector. 10% of portfolio is my maximum exposure for this one. Please remember, if you already own a Canadian equity fund you will already have about a 40% exposure to natural resource plays. The natural resources fund purchase augments (or overweights) you in this area.<p>Finally, recent news items report that stock promoter Robert Friedland, the star of the megabuck's sale of his Voisey's Bay nickel property to Inco, has had his US$153 million profits temporarily frozen by the US government. They claim that Friedland failed to clean up massive environmental damage in Colorado. Some observers say that a small <i>lake</i> of cyanide and other lethal chemicals exist. The mess was left by Friedland's Galactic Resources Heap Leaching operation a few years ago. Friedland is crying foul, saying that he was not properly advised of the injunction so his lawyers could defend him and that the US government had never legally proven his involvement with the damage. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse100re.gif">TSE Resource<p></a><a href="charts/goldspre.gif">Gold Spread<p></a><a href="charts/tsegoldi.gif">TSE Gold Index<p></a><a href="charts/tsemetal.gif">TSE Metals<p></a><a href="charts/tsepaper.gif">TSE Paper<p></a><a href="charts/tseoilan.gif">TSE Oil/Gas<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="canada.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="mutual.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>85</center></body></html>

Through Citibank, AGF's services will also allow access to Interac and Cirrus ATM's-systems denied to all but the Canadian banking system. <b>Trimark Financial</b> have recently gone a similar route by buying little <b>Bayshore Trust </b>for $35 million. By buying Bayshore, Trimark will get membership in the Canadian Payments Association. This will allow Trimark to offer chequing and other banking privileges to Trimark's one million unitholders. Many observers see this as a direct attack on the banks, whose low interest savings and chequing accounts provides important bank revenue.<p><b>TD Greenline</b> is about to offer Internet trading to its customers. The trading system, known as "WebBroker" will be offered on a test basis to a group of high volume clients. Later "WebBroker" will be offered nationally by the end of September.

My May 28 recommendation to buy bonds is working out. Last month, I mentioned that a break above $111.00 will confirm a new rally. This week our benchmark Govt. of Canada bonds of 2011 closed at $112.30. The basis of this recommendation remains intact. The Canadian economy is weakening, meaning that the need to borrow money is also declining and interest rates (the cost of borrowing money) are falling as economic demand subsides.<p>Our Presidential Election Cycle strategy has also worked. The Federal Reserve Board's policy committee will only meet once before the US Presidential Elections on Nov. 5th. After repeatedly avoiding higher rates over the past months, it seems unlikely that anything will be done at the late September meeting. Some observers believe that the US economy will have slowed by the end of the third quarter. I believe that <i>if</i> <i>the Fed. has</i> <i>some economic belt tightening to do</i>, it will come in early 1997, after the new presidential "honeymoon" is over. That could be a very dangerous time for the stock and bond markets<p>My US bond yield target has been met at just over 7% and interest rates are falling as bond prices increase in value. While it seems that the spectre of price inflation has vanished, two warnings are being circulated. In Canada, observers are warning that Canadian interest rates may not have too far to fall from these levels. In the US, the CRB Index has completed its biggest correction in a few years, but is still in a bullish trend and has started to recover from earlier losses. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/10yrustb.gif">10 Yr.

The best relative performance is in the (less senior) Nasdaq technology sectors and the CBOE Biotechnology indices, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the New York Stock Exchange are not far behind. <p>While the US economy is strong and the Fed. is being accommodative, we have probably got a rally in place (see bond fund commentary). I believe that technology and biotechnology will do relatively better over the next few months. Some suitable Canadian funds that invest in smaller cap. US companies include: Universal US Emerging Growth; United American Growth and 20/20 Aggressive Growth. As I said when I prematurely recommended these three funds on May 28... "These funds are more volatile than mainstream US funds. Diversify your risk."<p>If you are a really experienced fund investor you may be pleased to hear that Mr. Robert Vesco finally found himself behind bars last week. Vesco, who looted a widely held mutual fund company of US$224 million back in the early 70's and also was indicted of trafficking in cocaine, lived the good life in the Bahamas and Costa Rica before ending up in Cuba.

As far as asset mixes go, an equities component of 65% Canadian-35% International should have the right mix of risk and reward.<p>EUROPE. The European markets have been relatively weak for the past two months, but have also not shown much risk of serious losses. While the trendline on the Morgan Stanley Europe index has broken, the trend-smoothing forty week moving average is still intact. The MS Europe chart looks very much like an index that has survived a minor correction. Germany cut interest rates last week-a move perceived by many to be a spur for European economic growth. Many senior European stock exchanges look to be in decent condition and I recommend buying additional European funds, up to 10% of your portfolio. My chart database of 50 international funds shows that as a sector, the European funds have done better over the past month than all other non Canadian sectors. My favourite European funds for purchase at this time are: Universal Euro. Opportunities (1yr 28.3%); Greenline Euro. Growth (1yr 13.9%); NN-Can Euro. (11.4%); Fidelity European Growth (9.9%).<p>ASIA. Japan is still a dud, I'm afraid. The Nikkei has been going down for the last few weeks, not enough to wreck anyone's portfolio, but enough for me to want to wait for the breakout for yet another month. The Yen is just in the beginnings of a rally against the US Dollar, which isn't helpful to an improvement in the Nikkei. My four benchmark Japanese mutual funds all did slightly better than the Nikkei, but their performance was still inconsequential. Hong Kong and Singapore look better this month. Hong Kong is trying to break out of a seven month trading range, and Singapore is rallying off the bottom of a well-defined trading range and looks good for an intermediate term rally. My three month old buy on Latin American funds remains in place, although nothing of significance has happened yet. The Mexican Bolsa has just moved to new highs, which is favourable, but my benchmark Latin fund charts are showing limited action in the context of an intermediate uptrend. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/europe.gif">Europe<p></a><a href="charts/eafe.gif">E.

Here's what we do know. The Canadian markets, evidenced by the TSE 300, have corrected about 7.5% since the end of May. My 50 favourite Canadian equity funds have ranged from +3% to -17% ( for the small cap. funds). The median fund (25 of 50) was down 5%. That's a decent correction, but not enough to be considered the kind of correction that clears out previous market excesses and gets us ready for a new Bull market. Some pockets of the Canadian marketplace have done well. Over the last month, TSE Financials (especially Banks) were tops, followed by TSE Pipelines, TSE Utilities and TSE Communications indices. The worst performers were TSE Industrial Products, TSE Transports, TSE Merchandising and the TSE Golds. The TSE is still in a clear uptrend. Technically, the market is still bullish and oversold on an intermediate term but not on a long term basis. Potentially positive action in other North American markets suggests to me that a Canadian equity rally is possible from these market levels. Personally, I'd like to hold off buying more until other indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are clearly confirming the new rally. Then we can make additional investments in the Canadian markets.<p>On the economic front, both the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and the Toronto Dominion Bank (TD) has released major reports on the state of the Canadian economy. They are in agreement on many key points. Our low interest rates, increased consumer spending and reduced anxiety about Quebec separation will fuel strong economic growth in Canada over the next 18 months. However, Joshua Mendelsohn, CIBC's chief economist, warns that the US Federal Reserve will probably adopt a more restrictive monetary policy in early 1997 by raising interest rates. The Canadian Gov. must follow along  just to protect the Canadian Dollar. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse300.gif">TSE 300<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="natres.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>73</center></body></html>

However, prices haven't clearly turned the corner into an uptrend yet. The political and economic messages are still mixed. Mr. Greenspan has had the opportunity to hike US interest rates, but appears to be staying true to the Presidential Election Cycle and avoiding a rate increase until after the November elections. Heaven help us in early 1997 when Bill Clinton is re-elected and US monetary policy will need to be cleaned up. Mr. Greenspan was speaking to Congress last week and mentioned concerns about rising wage inflation. As I advised last month, rising wages are one of the most important contributors to price inflation. On the other side of the coin, the CRB Index, our harbinger of consumer price inflation, has dropped like a rock over the past month. It looks to me as if the CRB commodity inflation scare is over for a while.<p>In the US I continue to watch 7.0% to 7.5% yield on longer term bonds. Yields exceeding 7.5% may be disastrous for the markets. <b>In Canada, I have recommended buying bonds and bond funds and I am using $106.00 on Government of Canada 9% bonds of 2011 as a Stop point. A move in bond prices above $111.00 on a weekly basis will point to a new bond rally. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/10yrustb.gif">10 Yr.

Indeed, in absolute numbers we have seen some of the biggest declines of the century. In percentage terms, however, it's been the approximate equivalent of a trader's "bad hair day". Always treat those newspaper reports with skepticism. Headlines that scream "One of the ten worst market days of the century" are out to sell newspapers-not sound investment advice. I remarked last month that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was operating in a multi-month trading range. On July 16th, the Dow had a daily high-to-low fluctuation of 270 points or 4.8%. The Dow dipped through the bottom of the trading range, but closed back <i>inside</i> the trading range and above the previous days close! Oh, so what! You might say. Here's a bit of "traders rules." When a market drops on high volume then recovers later in the day to close above the previous day's close, traders refer to this as a "Reversal Day" and regard this as a bullish signal. Why? Because after the sellers dropped the market precipitously, there were still plenty of buyers willing to step in and drive prices all the way back up. Tremendous buying power is needed to reverse such a powerful downtrend. Incidentally, this "Reversal Day" happened twice, the second time nearly a week later on July 24th. It's as if large amounts of money are lurking out there waiting to buy back in. That's Institutional Money by the way, not retail fund investors like you and me. Oh, and guess who panicked and caused those few big drops over the last few weeks? The Institutions again!<p>Last month I mentioned that the US indices were heading for an oversold condition that could set the stage for a multi-month tradable rally. Well, the US markets are clearly oversold. Even volatile indices like the Nasdaq and the CBOE Biotech Index seem to have had most of the previous price excesses blown out of their indices. Keep an eye out for prices to reverse to the upside again. When? We'll have to wait until the markets show us the time to buy by changing to a positive trend.<p>By the way, while we wait to catch the next investment wave, why not try to invent something? Mr. Bill Killiam of Philadelphia has invented a type of lawn ornament (bunnies, gnomes and skunks) that speaks to visitors and takes messages. Activated by a motion detector, "The Lawn Buddy" will recite a brief message from the homeowner and take messages from visitors. Mr. Killiam says that "Everybody needs a Buddy", which probably explains why he's now working on a line of Home Buddies and Room Buddies. Don't laugh, dear readers. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/dowjones.gif">Dow Jones<p></a><a href="charts/nasdaq.gif">NASDAQ<p></a><a href="charts/cboebiot.gif">CBOE Biotech<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="inter.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>28</center></body></html>

The weakest is the Dow Jones World Average which over the past month, has sunk into the bottom quartile of my domestic and international indices' list. The EAFE has done somewhat better but is still in the bottom third of the rankings. I'd not buy broadly-based international funds for the time being and would wait for a new rally phase. As for liquidating investment positions, the daily charts of several prominent Canadian international funds seem to be in sound condition. Top performer Trimark Fund is a little weaker than the others, but it's still a little too soon to start panicking. I'd rather give the markets the benefit of the doubt by looking for a rally, rather than try a quick out/in trade.<p><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/e.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>UROPE. I think that I've had the European sector on my buy list almost every month for nearly two years. The past month ended up being the worst performance to date, with the Morgan Stanley Europe Index falling about 3%. Again, I'd stick with the investment for the time being, at least. Having checked the daily price charts of some of the more successful European funds, you can see that for the past month these funds have held up well in absolute terms. They have also done better than mutual funds invested in most other world regions.<p><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/a.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>SIA. Yet again; for the umpteenth consecutive month,  Japanese equity investments are held in check by the 21,000 to 22,000 point price ceiling on the Nikkei. I recommended selling Japanese funds in the New Year at 21,000 points after buying a few months before at 15,000. A great trade-if a weakening Yen hadn't devalued the profits. Instead of a 50% profit over three months, the net profit was more like 12%. Some funds employ currency hedging. Some funds also get the hedge wrong-it's one more investment decision than can go astray. I think that the Japanese markets are falling now because the US Dollar is weakening against the Yen and the Mark. Higher currency rates make for more expensive exports and lower profits. Hong Kong is still going sideways in the context of an uptrend.More patience is needed.<p><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/l.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>ATIN AMERICA. Most Latin American markets have done badly during the last month. I was premature in putting a buy on these markets but as with last month's opinion, if you are in, stay in. Just don't add to your position at this point.<p>Finally, even Emerging Markets get their share of crooks. Last Saturday, the Jakarta Post advised readers that a string of "criminal hypnotists" had cheated thousands of Indonesian investors by persuading them to give up their valuables (send Allen your money). Some investors (buy Allen a car) were even persuaded to empty bank accounts and give the money to the (don't forget Allen) thieves. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/morgstan.gif">E.

Last month, I moaned about the debacle of Cartaway Resources, the one time "New Bre-X," roaring to the stars with investor's money as rocket fuel. Suddenly Cartaway fell 90% in value, as investors realized that the actual assay results were merely one tenth of the visual estimate that caused the rocket motors to ignite. Cartaway, that powerful metals exploration play that ironically made garbage receptacles last year, has been eclipsed by another jewel from the East, Timbuktu Gold. Timbuktu's rocket crashed not on bad assay estimates, but on complete fraud. A certain Mr. Oliver Reese of Timbucktu Gold was suddenly exposed as having a list of securities infractions going back for about 30 years. You may remember Mr. Reese from the mid-80's as the promoter of a scheme to 'rework' King Solomon's Mines. All these escapades have shook the faith of the "punters," who will believe anything at the top of the markets, and believe nothing at the bottom.<p>The Vancouver Stock Exchange has been in a tailspin, as "investors" bailed out and TV reported that promoters like Murray Pezim were at risk of losing the third fortune of their lifetimes. This selloff also affected the (more senior) Toronto Stock Exchange indices. The blue chip-oriented TSE 35 did better than the broadly based TSE 300. The small cap Canadian mutual funds were hurt badly.<i> BPI Canadian Small Companies</i> manager Steve Misener was in the office about three weeks ago and he described his strategy for the next couple of months. His intention was to liquidate junior plays to raise a 25% cash position in July. He hoped to buy back at bargain prices. According to <i>BPI Canadian Small Co's</i> chart, the fund is down about fourteen percent and I don't know how much liquidation he may have done. On the other hand, he's still up over 47% for the past year. That's a good year by anyone's standards.<p>Despite all of the negativity out there, the TSE 300 is still operating in a long term uptrend. Watch for a close below 4850 on the TSE 300. If this occours it will signal the beginning of a negative trend. <b>On an intermediate term basis, the TSE is oversold, setting the stage for a surprise rally.<p></b>Finally, if you thought that no one in Canada is making money these days, you'll be amazed to know that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police-our beloved Mounties-are starting to make money on their souvenir marketing venture with Disney Canada. After surviving the chuckles and Mickey Mouse jokes, the RCMP have netted about $150,000 after the first two months of sales. The money goes to fund community policing projects. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse300.gif">TSE 300<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="index.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="natres.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>67</center></body></html>

Most <i>good</i> natural resources funds actually beat the TSE Gold index, possibly due to some oil related investments, or to some smart trading. Funds like <i>BGR Precious Metals</i> took smaller losses than some funds and are actually seeing a price recovery. One fund that took substantial losses was <i>Global Strategy Divers. Gold</i>, which lost about 25% in the last six weeks. However, since the start of 1996, both BGR and Global Strategy are <i>still ahead</i> by between 45 and 50%. Investing is a tough game, even if you win big (and 50% return in six months is winning BIG)!. Somehow, we always count the drop from the all-time high as money lost, but we don't count capital losses to our portfolio unless we actually sell our investments. It's a funny world.<p><b>Charts on the TSE Gold, Paper and Forest and the TSE Resources 100 Index all show an</b> <b>intermediate term bottom and an (oversold) rally developing.</b> <b>This fits in</b> <b>with a similar pattern forming in the TSE 300.</b> However, the TSE Oil and Gas indices are still near the top of their trading range. Also, the long term channel that has enclosed the trading action on the TSE Mines/Metals index looks to be teetering on the edge of a breakdown. The Mines chart may recover, if the rest of the markets pick up momentum. We'll have to wait and see on that one.<p>My chart showing the spread ratio between London Gold and the TSE Gold Index shows that the ratio has dropped from an overpriced 35:1 ratio down to about 28:1. This means that some of the excess pricing in gold stocks has been blown out. A ratio of 28:1 isn't great, because in the past six years, the ratio has been as low as 15:1. However, there is a built-in inflation factor at work, or more accurately-an investor inflation expectation. The growth in the Bullion vs TSE Gold ratio compares similarly with the growth in price action of the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index, our consumer inflation indicator. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse100re.gif">TSE Resource<p></a><a href="charts/goldvbul.gif">TSE Gold Bullion<p></a><a href="charts/tsegoldi.gif">TSE Gold Index<p></a><a href="charts/tsemetal.gif">TSE Metals<p></a><a href="charts/tsepaper.gif">TSE Paper<p></a><a href="charts/tseoilan.gif">TSE Oil/Gas<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="canada.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>40</center></body></html>

<html><head><title>The Informed Investor Newsletter - Bond Funds</title></head><body background="../images/tile.gif" bgcolor=#ffffff link=#297b63 vlink=#297b63 alink=#31ad84><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/home.gif" width=55 height=16 align=right border=0 alt="Home" vspace=5 hspace=5></a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <img src="../titles/bonds.gif"><p><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6><tr><td><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2></td><td><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/t.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>he shocking news at the end of last week was that the US economy was much stronger than expected, as US unemployment rates fell to 5.3%, the lowest rate in six years. Many economists see low unemployment (and rising wages) as the main component of price inflation. If the selection of available workers is low, then an employer may have to pay more to get the right staff. Unions bargain for their members from a position of strength in such an environment. This news sent the bond markets into a tailspin, causing the biggest one day trading losses in over four months.The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 114 points, reflecting fears that the Federal Reserve may hike interest rates to control the economy. As I've pointed out several times in the past months, The Fed. is trying very hard to accommodate the Incumbent on his bid for a November re-election. Bill Clinton has claimed credit for the low unemployment figure-a politically sound strategy. But he must now hope that The Fed. can stave off any big interest rate hikes for the next few months. In early 1997, after a successful re-election, The Fed. can tighten to its heart's content.<p>My long term bet on longer term bond yields is a rise to 7.00 to 7.5%. The US 10 year T Bond Index chart shows just over 7% now.<p>I notice that the CRB Index seems to be attempting a rally, indicating from another source, that inflation is still lurking out there. In Canada, our economy is diverging from the US. Also on Friday, we announced that our unemployment rate had <i>risen</i> and was now over 10%. Our bond and stock markets did not get hurt as badly as our neighbours to the South. Our economy seems to be muddling along.<p>I have recommended buying bonds and will stay with that strategy. Our bond indicator,  The Govt. of Canada bonds of 2011, has lost a little ground since the recommendation, but my Stop Loss point remains under $106.00, which is still about $2.50 below present levels.<p>One useful counterpoint to the inflation scenario came from that recent talk with Steve Misener of BPI Capital. Steve does not see an upsurge of inflation, because he sees inflation fear as strictly a US phenomenon. Worldwide inflation requires worldwide participation. He remarked that the world divides into three trade blocks, Asia, Europe and North plus Central America. Most analysts agree that Japan has more to fear from deflation than inflation. Japan has also protected themselves against currency inflation by moving manufacturing facilities offshore. In Europe, Germany's manufacturing powerhouse has copied Japan by moving manufacturing to cheaper countries like the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. In the America's, Canada and Mexico are not enjoying the economic expansion (and inflation fears) that are prevalent in the States. Steve believes that the #1 cause of inflation is labour costs, yet the world's major manufacturing centres are moving their production plants to low cost countries. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/10yrustb.gif">10 Yr.

Gone is <i>Mackenzie Financial</i>, in favour of a multi-manager approach involving <i>Mawer Investment Management, McLean Budden and</i> <i>O'Donnell Management. Templeton</i> is retained as international managers.<p><i>Mackenzie</i> will have a new role, offering their funds to CMA members as part of a new RRSP program.<p><i>Canada Trust</i> is also changing managers. <i>Mulvihill Investment Management</i> will step down from <i>CT'</i>s funds in favour of a new in-house management group. John Mulvihill was formerly head of <i>CT'</i>s investment management subsidiary. <i>CT</i> says that a recent internal investment management re-organization made outside investment management services redundant.<p><i>Trimark Investment Management</i>, Canada's second largest fund manager, is launching the <i>Discovery Fund</i>. The fund will capitalize on  international "idea driven, knowledge-based companies" in the technology, telecommunications, biotechnology and applied science fields. Trimark Discovery fund is aimed at long term investors, who are seeking aggressive growth. <i>Trimark</i> will use their normal bottom-up fundamental investment analysis approach and expect to stay fully invested. <i>Trimark</i> expect to shorten their investment holding period down to two to three years. <i>Trimark</i> funds' holding period is normally four years, differing considerably from many aggressive funds, whose investment holding period can sometimes be measured in months.<p><i>Investors Group, </i>Canada's largest fund company, will add eleven new funds to their lineup. Under the <i>Investors'</i> name, five funds will be offered, including: a small cap. Canadian; a natural resources fund; a U.S. fund with a higher small/mid cap. concentration, a high-yield bond fund and a Latin fund. Outside managers Sceptre Mutual Funds will offer three funds and Buetel Goodman will also offer three funds. These new funds will be in addition to 30 funds that Investors already offers to Canadians.<p><i>Scudder Canada </i>will now offer their no-load funds through Royal Bank's Action Direct discount brokerage service. Scudder Canada, an affiliate of giant US fund managers Scudder Stephens and Clark, have changed distribution strategy and plan to look for other discount brokerage affiliations. The Scudder funds will still be offered on a no-load basis, but discount brokers will probably charge a small redemption fee upon redemption.<p><i>TD Bank </i>launches ACCESS. The TD Bank will now offer  a full package of banking and brokerage services 24 hours per day. Amongst many other services, ACCESS permits 24 hour access to TD Greenline, permitting the sale of North American stocks, options and about 500 Canadian mutual funds.<p>Spectrum United Mutual Funds will shortly ask shareholders to approve an integration between Spectrum, Bullock and United funds. Spectrum, who already own United and Bullock, is planning to streamline their fund offerings by amalgamating five funds and further expect to benefit from other economies of scale. Spectrum now has $4.5 Billion under management and is a subsidiary of Sun Life. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>There are no<br>charts related<br>to this article.</font><p></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="books.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font></center></body></html>

James O'Shaunessy's upcoming book <i>"What Works on Wall Street</i>" studies the long-term performance of 60 different investment strategies. O'Shaunessy seems to believe that <i>discipline</i> is the key to investing. Almost two thirds of the tested strategies beat the S&P 500's 40 year average return of 11%. The best strategy looked for stocks valued above $150 million, stocks with 5 years worth of earnings growth and stocks with a price to sales ratio under 1.5. Finally, from the remaining companies, the 50 stocks showing the strongest price growth (relative strength) for the past year were picked. This strategy would have gleaned a very handsome annual average return of 18.2% over the past 40 years.<p>For those of you who like the Baby Boomer Demographics story, a new book from David Foot (with Daniel Stoffman) called "<i>Boom, Bust and Echo-how to profit from the Coming</i> <i>Demographic Shift</i>". Professor Foot, a U. Of Toronto economist/demographer is a leading practitioner of demographics and economics and has produced a very lucid and readable book. With the assistance of Daniel Stoffman we get to read about the Real Estate Meltdown, how demographics explains the real estate boom of the 70's and 80's and why things will be very different over the next decade. Corporations and the nature of work will change. Why retailers selling quality and service will beat out the low price merchants. How will our leisure time change? Will boomers still ski-as they age and their muscles stiffen? Gardening could be the next Cool Leisure Activity!! What are Canada's health trends? How will our family life change as most of us get older?<p>A couple of months ago, I moaned and groaned about the investment and financial planning industry's fixation with the Baby Boom and the science of demographics. My problem with demographics is that widely held knowledge is discounted by the markets, because investors buy in anticipation of future events. Investing with a ten to twenty year horizon is really difficult. Many investment Pro's. have difficulty projecting any further than one year ahead. Fashion and habits change too. Remember the polyester leisure suit of twenty years ago. It should have been a big winner. That said, there is much in Foot's approach that will help you explain and anticipate changes in your life and surroundings-it's well worth your time to read his book. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>There are no<br>charts related<br>to this article.</font><p></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="mutual.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="us.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font></center></body></html>

Charts of the Dow Jones Industrial Average illustrate that the Dow is still in the middle of its trading range. Volume in all of the major US stock indices has been relatively light during the recent correction. Investments often decline on relatively low volume, but low volume also means that there is little panic selling. On a long term basis, the US markets are no bargain, but intermediate term, the Dow; S&P 500; New York Composite and the Nasdaq are rapidly heading for an oversold situation. This may lead to a tradable rally over the next few months. I apologize to you for calling a buy on the US small cap. markets last month. In retrospect, these markets were due for a short term correction. I still expect that the investment will make a profit within the next few months.<p>In the bond section, I mentioned that my goal on rising longer term US bond yields is 7.00 to 7.5%. Levesque Securities quantitative analysts just published a study identifying 7.5% US bond yield and 5.25% US T-Bill rate as the critical trigger for a major correction in the S and P 500. Levesque liken the present US bond vs equities scenario to Spring 1987. Remember what happened in September and October?<p>Finally, you thought that all of the nefarious market activities were limited to Canadian markets. We have recently seen the previously mentioned Cartaway (and First Marathon Securities), Timbuktu Gold and Oliver Reese.We have also read about a court case involving some Thunder Bay credit unions claiming substantial losses from trading<i> derivatives</i> with Nesbitt Burns. However, when we go to the US everything (as usual) is done on a bigger scale.<p>Mr.Henryk de Kwiatkowski is suing broker Bear Stearns for $300 million in investment losses. Mr. Kwiatkowski claims that Bear Stearns put his money into his currency trading account and traded it away, instead of putting it into a conservative trust fund for his children. Bear Stearns say that Mr. Kwiatkowski is a very sophisticated investor and is trying to shift the blame for his losses. There's a point to this tale. Over the years I have seen, or heard about many junior league versions of this story. Some brokers are unscrupulous, but probably an equal number of investors do stupid things and then expect someone else to accept financial responsibility. Equally tragic are the many situations where what the clients think was said, and what the advisor  thinks they heard, are very different stories. As an informed investor, you owe it to yourself to check your monthly statements regularly and periodically review your investment strategy with your advisor. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/dowjones.gif">Dow Jones<p></a><a href="charts/nasdaq.gif">NASDAQ<p></a><a href="charts/sp500.gif">SP 500<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="books.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="inter.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>40</center></body></html>

Both the DJ World Index and the Morgan Stanley EAFE are looking a little overbought and could correct about 5% from recent highs. Longer term, <b>I believe that these markets will rally again</b>, so I advocate holding on to general international funds such as those offered by <i>Trimark, Templeton and Saxon funds. <p></i><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/e.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>UROPE. The Morgan Stanley Europe Index continues to trend higher. <b>Continue to invest in this sector</b>. Best performing European funds for the past year are: <i>Universal Euro. Opportunities (39.3%); Green Line Euro Growth (21.0%); Fidelity European Growth (19.8%); Dynamic Europe (19.8%); Altamira European Equity (17.9%)<p></i><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/a.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>SIA. I still can't bring myself to recommend buying into the Japanese markets. We still need to clear my trigger point of 22,800 on the Nikkei. The Yen/Dollar relationship is becoming a concern again. The Japanese markets tend to fall under a strong Yen (Japanese exports become more expensive) and Japanese markets rally under a weak Yen (cheaper export costs). The US Dollar has been very strong lately, but it has not been enough to blast the Nikkei above the four year price ceiling at about 21,000 points. Looking at the <a href="charts/usvsjapy.gif">Yen/Dollar chart</a> I think that we could see a weakening of the US Dollar against the Yen (and German Mark) leading to more Nikkei declines. One factor in this is the recent Copper trading scandal involving Sumitomo Bank's trading losses. Originally estimated at $1.8 Billion, some estimates go as high as $4 billion. Sumitomo will probably have to repatriate this money from overseas investments, likely US Dollar investments. This may drop the Dollar and rally the yen and will not be a welcome scenario for Japanese equity funds. Watch the Nikkei Tokyo chart. <b>If we break above 22,800 then the previously mentioned problems have been resolved and Japanese funds will be a buy</b>.<p><b>I remain positive on Hong Kong</b>, with a target of 12,500 points. One strategy that you might consider is to buy a package of a Japanese fund and a Hong Kong fund. These two Asian regions are negatively correlated. The Hong Kong Dollar is closely tied to the US Dollar. The Yen makes the Tokyo markets work the opposite way. When the US Dollar is positively influencing the Tokyo markets, it negatively impacts Hong Kong (and vice-versa, of course).<p><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/l.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>ATIN AMERICA. The Latin markets are a mixed bag lately, with Mexico correcting as Brazil and Chile improve. Our three Latin funds also show mixed results, with <i>20/20 Latin</i> <i>America and Global Strategy Latin</i> showing price improvement and <i>CI Sector Latin</i> weakening. I recommended Latin American funds last month, but would prefer to turn cautious short term and wait for a more positive price trend. Do not sell your Latin holdings. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/europe.gif">Europe<p></a><a href="charts/eafe.gif">E.

As mentioned last month, the junior venture plays are flying, although I did not expect my warning to be careful, to be needed so quickly.<p>The rise and fall of Cartaway Resources should serve us as an example in the risks of speculation. No doubt we have all read the story by now. My interest in this episode is seeing how this action effected Canadian mutual fund prices. I keep daily price charts on about 200 equity funds and all I did was screen them to find which funds took a big hit during the time of the Cartaway debacle. As you might expect, many natural resources funds lost money as Cartaway took its one day drop from $26 to $3. Some growth stock funds were also affected. Of course, while some fund managers paid in the high teens to low twenties for Cartaway, other fund managers bought shares in the two to three dollar range, before the big runup. I was wondering last month why many natural resource funds were doing so well, while the TSE natural resources indices did nothing. It appears that some resource/growth fund managers have been very prescient in grabbing these runaway junior venture situations at relatively low prices.<p>The World seems to be slowly getting the message that Canada is "in play." Investment by foreigners is climbing, partly due to our elected members (bless 'em) getting the Provincial/Federal finances in order. I surveyed my little list of 44 worldwide indices and sub indices using local currency data. Since the Referendum in late October, the top twenty-five percent (11 indices) were mostly Canadian sub indices. Only Mexico, Tokyo and Madrid made it to the top list.<p>My own view is that we <i>should</i> attract international attention if we are approaching the top of the investment cycle. We have a large natural resources base, and commodities/natural resources generally do well at this point in the cycle. Over 40% of our markets are in commodities related companies.

I believe that it's time to get back into the bond market, buying quality bond funds and buying bonds to hold for maturity. Look closely at the action of past bond selloffs on the Government of Canada bonds of 2011. You can see that when the bond market corrects it will break below the trend-smoothing 30 week moving average. The bonds then start a strong recovery. That should be the way things go this time. Our low point in late April was $106.00. We will use that as our Stop Out point in case I am being a little too quick off the mark.<p>In the US, the bond markets have been mixed in the past few weeks. The Fed. stance seems to be to avoid changing interest rates going into the Presidential Elections. This accommodates Mr. Clinton, who is also trying to ensure smooth sailing by pushing hard to get Democrat Fed. nominee's approved quickly. Some Fed. officials are getting a little concerned that rising wage demands may become an inflationary factor and that rising commodities prices will be more than a short term phenomenon. Overall economic factors remain positive. Productivity for US workers grew by 2.6% for the first quarter. America claims the most productive workers in the world based on these figures, and worker efficiency is an essential component to generating fast growth without increases in inflation. Unemployment is down to 5.5% and retail sales are slightly lower.<p>The CRB Index, our harbinger of consumer inflation got as high as 264.00 and has gone into a minor correction phase. The long term trend is still heading up. I am still betting on 272.00+ as an upside target. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/10yrustb.gif">10 Yr.

These comments are presented to you because, as an informed mutual funds investor, these comments are relevant to understanding the risks of investment in some foreign/emerging markets.<p>Emerging countries need <b>democracy</b>, a <b>functional economy</b> and also <b>Rule of Law</b>.<p>Democracy is needed to provide the political guarantees and suitable incentives/motivation  for a good market-based economy.<p>The existence of Rule of Law is very important to pursuade investors to do business. Think about the McDonalds fiasco in Beijing a few years ago. Amid much fanfare McDonalds signed a multi-year lease to sell burgers at one of Beijing's most popular locations. Sometime later, the Chinese government arrived and said that they wanted the location for other purposes. McDonalds would have to move. Mcdonalds fought the decision, correctly observing that they had signed a long term lease with the Chinese government. The Chinese response was they <i>needed</i> the space. Just think about these attitudes in the context of Hong Kong in 1997. Thatcher said that she had repeatedly tried to re-negotiate Hong Kong's 99 year lease for Great Britain. Chinese Chairman Deng's attitude towards Hong Kong did not reflect a desire to see Hong Kong flourish, as is widely assumed, but to have the leased land returned to China. Hong Kong's economic success is a secondary consideration. Thatcher believes that China will go after Taiwan after Hong Kong is absorbed. Also, China is apparently selling nuclear weapons to Iran, increasing the risk of de-stabilization in the Middle East and is again challenging Philippine sovereignty to areas of the Gulf of Taiwan <p>A functional economy is critical. Thatcher was very critical of Russia also. Too much corruption, a lack of Rule of Law and an economy so grossly inefficient that between 25-35% of Russian raw materials and crops never make it to the markets. These are not foundations for prudent foreign investment. <p>Baroness Thatcher has never been a fan of the European Economic Community (EEC) and she has little belief that Europe's (disparate) nations can work smoothly. The loss of a country's parliamentary sovereignty to a central government, adoption of a common social charter and a common currency are major hurdles for many Europeans. For example, as countries, Britain and France have disliked and distrusted each other for a thousand years. What are the odds of the two countries having their interests intertwined by the bureaucrats of Brussels.<p>My conclusion to Baroness Thatchers' speech is to be prudent and stay away from Russian and Chinese investments. The risk in Hong Kong and Taiwan will increase within the next year or two, so buying into an investment concept that includes Asia as a <i>long term strategy, </i>may need careful monitoring. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>There are no<br>charts related<br>to this article.</font><p></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="us.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font></center></body></html>

The trend continues with the the most senior indices leading the pack. The latest to follow to the upside is the Standard and Poor's 500, now clearly in rally mode. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is just starting to poke above price resistance at 5750. Give it a little while longer to clearly escape from the trading range then watch for some action. The newspapers have been filled with news items about the Dow turning 100 years old, describing it as the most followed of market indices. What this means to me is that when the Dow makes a clear break to new highs the Investing Public will jump aboard, big time. The broad market's rally has been sneaking along in the background. I sense that the senior markets have become laggards-<b>the action will remain in Nasdaq type technology, and emerging US markets.</b> <p>Here are three funds that invest in US small cap/emerging markets. <i>Universal US</i> <i>Emerging Growth</i>. Also has 20.4% of portfolio in technology. One year 62.9%; <i>United American Growth</i>. Invests in small and medium cap. Companies. Has 24.7% in technology. One year 52.2%; <i>20/20 Aggressive Growth</i>. Invests in small and medium cap US companies. Has 58.8% in technology. One year 40.8%. These funds are more volatile than mainstream US funds. Diversify your risk.<p>On other fronts, Fidelity Investments lost ace manager Jeffrey Vinik, who resigned to form his own portfolio management company. Mr. Vinik, who successfully managed the mega Magellan Fund for the past four years-has recently been dogged by slumping performance and controversy. However, under his tutelage Magellan grew from $20 billion to over $50 billion. For perspective, that means that Magellan Fund is about one third the size of the entire Canadian fund industry. The new manager is Robert Stansky, who with Vinik trained under Fidelity legend Peter Lynch. Many Fidelity watchers feel that Mr. Stansky's growth stock philosophy is better suited to managing Magellan.<p>Mr. Vinik's market clout was so great that his resignation triggered a short term panic in the stock and bond markets. Wall Street fretted about the effects of unwinding his massive bond positions into the markets. I wonder if Jeffrey Vinik, high school student, ever dreamed that twenty-five years later he would shift the biggest market in the world by getting a new job?<p>Finally, just when you thought you had all the toys, on Manhattans Lower East Side, you can own your own Internet wired apartment for about CDN$2000 per month, plus about $150 for the ultra-fast "T-1" line to surf the world from downtown New York. That sounds like more fun than most of us could stand. However, a true Cybernaut would live cheap in Montana and surf from there. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/dowjones.gif">Dow Jones<p></a><a href="charts/nasdaq.gif">NASDAQ<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="ironlady.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="inter.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>15</center></body></html>

The Dow Jones World Index is still in a solid uptrend, but the Morgan Stanley EAFE looks to be in a minor correction. <b>On balance, this should not trigger any portfolio changes.<p></b><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/e.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>UROPE. The Morgan Stanley Europe Index is in a minor correction, probably explaining the weakness in the broader-based EAFE. The Europe Index is at 755.00. If we break below about 740, then the trend may be turning negative. At present, we can wait.<p>The European markets seem quiet for the past two weeks, reducing me to report the following information.<p>Britain announced that it will probably dispose of up to 750,000 Mad Cow infected carcasses by incinerating parts of them in British power stations. Without doubt, this Summer, Britain should smell like the world's biggest barbecue.<p><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/a.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>SIA. The Japanese markets have yet to make a <i>clear</i> breakout above the long term price ceiling at about 21,500 to 22,500 on the Nikkei. I will continue to wait for 22,800 as the buy point. There is only one reason for that ceiling. Japanese institutions are unloading their shares. If we clear that level then they have finished selling and there is plenty of profit ahead. I am a lot less sanguine about having the Yen work in our favour. The rally in the Yen that I described last month petered out as the US Dollar gained strength against most foreign currencies. That will dampen profitability of your mutual fund after conversion to Canadian dollars<p>Over the past weekend, the Japanese banks reported (bad) loan losses worth US$47 Billion. This was their biggest loss in 50 years. Sumitomo Trust Bank reported a loss so big that it surpassed the last five years' profits! Fortunately for the banks, there have been good securities markets and low interest rates to reduce the financial pressure. Without these bad loans from the late 80's, the banks would have had excellent profits. Even so, only four of eleven banks managed to show profit for the past year. Estimates of the remaining bad debts seem to indicate that just under half of all the banks bad debts are still outstanding.<p>The Hong Kong markets are struggling to rally. My target remains at the previous all time high of 12,500 on the Hang Seng<p><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/l.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>ATIN AMERICA. Over the past month, Latin funds have been the strongest international sector. <b>Maybe it's time that I stopped worrying about the Peso and recommended this particular group</b>. Here are the three top Latin funds by one year performance:<i> GT. Latin America (26.4%); Scotia Excell Latin America (25.5%); Fidelity Latin American Growth (18.9%)<p></i>On the lighter side, Mexican music stations have had a field day with a song poking fun at ex-president Carlos Salinas as the master of a failed circus. His jailed brother Raul stars as a magician whose best trick is to make money disappear. Raul is in jail for embezzling millions of dollars of government funds while Carlos ran the country. It is unusual for Mexicans to be so disrespectful of a former leader.

For example 100 years minus 45 years = 55 years. A 45 year old should have a portfolio of 55% equities; 35% bonds; 10% money market.

<p><p>                              
Dear Reader:
<p>
Enclosed is a copy of the <a href= "pplan1.htm">draft Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan-Revision 1.</a> 
This revised Plan would supersede the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan
dated December 1994.  The revised Plan reflects the Administration's Fiscal Year 1997 budget
request for the Program, as well as the guidance provided by the Congress in the Fiscal Year 1996
appropriations legislation.
<p>
This Administration is committed to resolving the complex and important issue of nuclear waste
in a timely and sensible manner.  The President's budget request for Fiscal Year (FY) 1997
supports an aggressive and efficient program to reach an early decision on the suitability of the
Yucca Mountain site in Nevada as a geologic repository.  Such a decision advances the Nation's
long-standing goal to achieve permanent disposal of radioactive waste.  The out-year budget
levels in the revised Plan will be accommodated within the Administration's overall discretionary
out-year budget levels identified in the President's FY 1997 request.
<p>
The strategy outlined in this revised Plan requires that activities be prioritized to enable the
Program to resolve the most important remaining technical questions concerning the viability of a
repository at Yucca Mountain by 1998.  If the Yucca Mountain site proves to be viable, then
implementation of this revised Program Plan would result in a formal application to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission for the permit to begin constructing the repository in 2002. 
Emplacement of nuclear waste would begin in 2010.
<p>
The ability to focus on the most critical scientific and technical questions at the Yucca Mountain
site is made possible by a decade of scientific work at the site, which includes extensive
underground exploration.  The approach outlined in the revised Plan will enable the Program to
reach a license application for about one billion dollars less than the previous Program Plan would
have required.
<p>
With regard to the issue of interim storage of commercial and Naval Reactor spent fuel, the
Administration strongly believes that any siting decision for such a facility must be based on
objective science-based criteria and that such a decision should not be made prior to the
completion of the scientific work necessary to determine the viability of the Yucca Mountain
repository site.  Prior to the completion of this scientific and technical work, the Administration
believes any activities related to the development of an interim nuclear waste storage facility must
be limited to non-site specific design and engineering activities.
<p>
This revised Plan is intended to ensure that the momentum that has been achieved in the Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management Program will be maintained and enhanced in the years ahead.  
However, the Department of Energy recognizes that the assumptions underlying this revised Plan
may turn out not to be valid.  Should this occur, the revised Plan will be updated and modified as
appropriate.
<p>
If you have any questions about our revised Program Plan, please contact Charles Teclaw, Office
of Program Management and Integration, Planning Division at  (202) 586-7292.  
<p>
<p>
<p>
					Sincerely,
<p>

					Office of Civilian Radioactive 
					 Waste Management</pre>

			  March 26, 1996</h2></head>
<hr>
<body>
I am Daniel A. Dreyfus, Director of the Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive
Waste Management.  I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss our Fiscal
Year (FY) 1997 budget request and the revised strategy for the Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management Program, which is being developed in response to FY 1996 Energy and Water
Development Appropriations actions.
<p>
		       <strong>    BACKGROUND</strong>
<p>
<b>The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as Amended.</b>  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 created
the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management within the Department of Energy to
develop a system to accept, transport, store, and permanently dispose of spent nuclear fuel from
commercial utilities.  To pay for the system, the Act established a Nuclear Waste Fund financed
by fees from the ratepayers of nuclear utilities.  A presidential decision in 1985 directed that the
system also provide for the disposal of radioactive wastes resulting from atomic energy defense
activities.  A General Fund appropriation is made to offset the costs associated with the disposal
of defense-related waste.  The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 designated the
Yucca Mountain site in Nevada for detailed scientific investigation to evaluate the site's
suitability for a geologic repository.
<p>
<b>Program Approach.</b>  In 1994, we proposed a Program Approach and funding profile that would
permit us to meet the policy goals set by Congress in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  That
approach was pursued with the FY 1995 appropriation of $522 million for the program, which
represented an increase of $142 million over the FY 1994 funding level of $380 million.  The
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program followed the Program Approach into the Fall
of 1995, when we received new policy redirection from Congress in our FY 1996 appropriation.  
<p>
<b>PAST YEAR'S PROGRESS</b>
<p>
I am pleased to report that we have made significant progress since my last appearance before
this committee.  Almost all of the increase in funding for FY 1995 was allocated to, and utilized
by the Yucca Mountain Project, which completed the fiscal year with accomplishments that often
exceeded our targets.
<p>
<b>Yucca Mountain. </b> We have completed more than one-half of the planned five mile exploratory
studies facility tunnel at Yucca Mountain and are now tunneling through the proposed repository
horizon.  Four test alcoves have been excavated to install instrumentation and to provide
scientists with access to major geologic features.  Thus far, we have found no unexpected
geologic conditions that would contradict our hypotheses about the Yucca Mountain site.  We
have substantially reduced the scientific and technical uncertainty concerning the suitability of
the proposed repository site through the analysis of scientific data collected to date.Since last year, we also completed a performance assessment of the whole repository system,
which indicated that the man-made engineered features of the repository, in conjunction with the
natural elements of the site, could provide containment of spent nuclear fuel and high-level
radioactive waste for tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.
<p>
<b>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation. </b> Over the past year we made progress on
cask development and environmental requirements for the transport of waste, assuming waste
acceptance in 1998.  In preparation to move large quantities of waste, we have initiated
non-site-specific contingency planning which will increase our capability to respond to new
policy
direction on interim storage.  We have developed concepts for a national waste acceptance and
transportation strategy that relies on the private sector for implementation; and a generic safety
analysis for an interim storage facility that could expedite facility licensing and development time
if a site is authorized.
<p>
<b>Program Management.</b>  Since last March, major improvements have been made in the
integration and efficiency of program management.  We have continued to improve integration of
activities, clarify lines of authority and responsibility, and increase our coordination with the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  The participants in the program have now been fully
consolidated under the program's Management and Operating contractor.  We are concentrating
current attention on the improvement of management information tools (e.g., schedule, baseline,
and reporting processes).  As a consequence of our planning and management improvements, we
have been able to develop a program that can preserve the objectives of the Yucca Mountain
project at substantially reduced funding levels.
<p>
I am pleased that the independent Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board acknowledged our
progress in their February 23, 1996 letter to Secretary O'Leary.  The Board, which is kept
informed on the progress of the program in detail agreed that:
<p>
    <blockquote> "Significant progress has been made in a number of areas at Yucca Mountain
     during this past year.  The DOE has greatly increased the efficiency of the
     underground tunneling operation at the site; the main tunnel is now more than 2.5
     miles long and is exploring at the proposed repository level.  The DOE is
     obtaining data about the character and hydrology of the underground rock where
     waste eventually could be placed.  In addition, a clear and technically defensible
     waste isolation strategy is beginning to emerge.  This strategy will help explain
     how the natural and engineered barriers at the site should work together to isolate
     radioactive waste from the environment.  Together with recent advances in
     repository performance assessment, the strategy will enable the DOE to set
     priorities among exploration and testing activities to achieve a better
     understanding of the hydrology and other characteristics of the site -- in less time
     and at less cost.  Finally, current management is continuing to improve program
     focus and effectiveness."</blockquote>
<p>
 <b>  PROGRAM REDIRECTION AND TRANSITION</b>
<p>
The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for FY 1996 provided a total of $400
million in discretionary funds for the program, of which $85 million may be expended only for
an interim storage facility upon enactment of specific statutory authority.  Lacking such authority,
the program was reduced to a $315 million funding level for FY 1996, which represents a forty
percent reduction in the level of effort from FY 1995.  
<p>
Congress recognized that a more constrained repository program would be required.  The
Conference Report accompanying the appropriations language provided specific guidance to
refocus the Yucca Mountain Project to emphasize core scientific activity, excavation of sections
of the exploratory studies facility necessary for scientific study, and completion of the repository
and waste package conceptual design.  The guidance also provided for the deferral of activities
supporting preparation and filing of a license application for the repository.
<p>
<b>Revised Program Strategy. </b> Consistent with the guidance provided by Congress, we have
defined a revised program strategy compatible with our new funding profile.  With reasonable
future funding support, however, we believe that our revised strategy will enable the program to
regain the longer range objectives of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act regarding the evaluation of
geologic disposal as a means to permanently isolate commercial spent nuclear fuel and defense
high-level radioactive waste from the environment.  In the immediate near-term, we have focused
available resources on addressing the most critical technical issues remaining in the repository
program and on the necessary transitional costs of the program reduction.
<p>
<b>Yucca Mountain.</b>  As Congress requested, we have refocused our efforts at Yucca Mountain to
address the critical unanswered technical questions leading to an assessment in 1998 of the
viability of licensing the proposed repository site.  These unanswered questions involve the
movement of water through the mountain, the presence of any geologic features that could
adversely impact repository performance, constraints on the repository's thermal load, selection
of materials for the waste packages, and the need for and feasibility of other engineered barriers
to enhance overall repository performance.
<p>
We have defined a set of products, consistent with FY 1996 Congressional guidance, that will
provide a better understanding of the repository design and its performance in the geologic
setting, a better appreciation of the remaining work needed to prepare a license application, and a
more accurate estimate of the cost of a repository.  We believe that these products taken together
will, by 1998, provide sufficient financial and technical data to allow the Congress to decide
whether to continue the program to repository licensing and construction.  Although Congress
also advised that repository licensing activities should be deferred in FY 1996, the long-range
goal of submitting a successful license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
remains central to the program's mission under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  The 1998
assessment will be an early and integral step on the path to preparing a repository environmental
impact statement and a license application.  Completion of the assessment by 1998 will be
possible because we can draw upon scientific studies done at the site since the 1970s, the large
amount of information collected over the past three years on site conditions, the progress already
made on the advanced conceptual designs for the repository and waste package, and the
understanding gained from the latest in our series of iterative total system performance
assessments.
<p>
Another key element of our revised program strategy will be to review and update the regulatory
framework for licensing a repository.  The existing framework that guides our investigation of
the Yucca Mountain site does not fully reflect policy changes since the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
was enacted in 1982, the experience of the past decade of work, and the realities of budgetary
constraints on the program.  Our objective is to focus on the safety considerations of the site
itself, while eliminating activities that are now known to be unnecessary to establish the safety of
the repository concept we will propose.  As I will explain later, we believe that we can regain a
target date of 2002 for submitting a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
for authorization to construct the repository.  That date will depend, of course, upon confirmation
of the viability of the Yucca Mountain site, a restructured approach to the remaining
regulatory-related work, and continued financial support.
<p>
<b>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation. </b> In response to Congressional direction, we
are closing out most of our waste acceptance, canister and cask development, and transportation
work.  We will not pursue the further development of a multi-purpose canister system for
transporting and disposing of spent fuel.  We believe that the multi-purpose canister approach is
sound, and private industry may elect to carry the design of one or more multi-purpose canister
systems forward.  The development and certification of advanced technology, legal-weight truck
casks for transportation of uncanistered spent fuel from reactors to a storage or disposal facility
will be phased out in an orderly manner to permit commercialization by private industry, if
warranted at a later date.  We plan to rely upon commercially available technologies when the
transportation of spent fuel begins.  In addition, we transferred the lead responsibility for the
multi-purpose canister environmental impact statement to the Department of the Navy, which has
a continuing requirement to document their decisions.
<p>
We have restructured our waste acceptance, storage, and transportation activities to maintain a
capability to respond quickly and effectively if new interim storage policy is forthcoming.  These
efforts will target two major near-term objectives.  First, we will work to engage industry in the
development of a market-driven waste acceptance and transportation strategy that relies heavily
on the private sector for implementation.  Second, we will conduct non-site-specific work on a
generic interim storage facility to make early progress toward an NRC license.
<p>
<b>Program Management. </b> As a result of the reduced FY 1996 funding level, we have had to
greatly reduce the contractor work scope and support in program management functions, which
include the activities of the Office of Human Resources and Administration, the Office of
Quality Assurance, and the Office of Program Management and Integration.  We have eliminated
approximately 1000 contractor positions at the Yucca Mountain Project and at our Washington,
D.C. headquarters.  We also reduced the funding we provide to maintain our cooperative
agreements with program stakeholders to one-third of their FY 1995 budgets.  As we took these
actions, we sought, within our existing authorities, to preserve essential program activities.
<p>
We have restructured our program management activities to further enhance our management
effectiveness.  Our primary objective is to retain the vital objectives of the program.  We will
concentrate on addressing significant cross-cutting technical issues; on improving the linkages
across the program through increased integration; on increasing the utilization of Federal staff
with a decreasing reliance on contractor support; and on major improvements in the program's
management tools such as schedules, baseline and change control, performance monitoring and
review, and reporting processes that will increase our ability to concentrate reduced resources on
meaningful accomplishments.
<p>
	       <b>  FY 1997 BUDGET REQUEST OVERVIEW</b>
<p>
The President's budget request for FY 1997 is consistent with the redirection resulting from the
FY 1996 budget reduction.  It will support the licensing approach that we have developed for the
repository program.
<p>
In order to support the scientific work on the permanent repository, the President's FY 1997
budget proposes to fund the program at a level of $400.028 million.  The civilian portion of the
radioactive waste management program is $200.028 million, to be derived from the Nuclear
Waste Fund.  The Defense share of $200 million is from the Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal
Appropriation.  It will cover the cost associated with the disposal of defense high-level
radioactive waste in the repository.  The full amount is intended to be discretionary
appropriations.  No other legislative action is required to support the appropriation.
<p>
Of the $400 million request, $339 million will go to the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization
Project.  Of the remaining funds, $10 million will go to the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and
Transportation Project, and $51 million will be required for Program Management activities.
<p>
<b>Yucca Mountain.  </b>The $339 million we are requesting for FY 1997 will be used to address the
remaining scientific and technical uncertainties concerning the construction and operation of a
repository at Yucca Mountain; and to regain a viable target to file a license application for a
repository in the year 2002.
<p>
We will apply the FY 1997 funding toward work on the four primary components of the
repository viability assessment.
<p>
<i>First, </i>we will complete a package of specific design work on the critical elements of the
repository and the waste package, including a concept of operations that identifies available
technologies to accomplish the objectives of geologic disposal.
<p>
<i>Second,</i> we will prepare a total system performance assessment, based upon this design concept
and available scientific and technical data, which will integrate and analyze design and site
characteristics and describe the probable behavior of the repository.
<p>
<i>Third,</i> we will develop a plan and cost estimate for the remaining work required to complete a
license application.
<p>
<i>And finally,</i> we will estimate the cost to construct and operate the repository.
<p>
Key repository activities to be undertaken during the fiscal year to support the assessment include
the completion of the exploratory studies facility and the continuation of our core science work. 
In FY 1997, we will gain access to and begin to test the properties of the Ghost Dance Fault, and
initiate the drift-scale thermal test to investigate the coupling of thermal hydrologic, mechanical,
and chemical processes in the rock.  This will be our first large-scale test that will explore how
the rock will behave in the presence of waste packages.
<p>
In FY 1997, we plan to reinitiate our National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) activities to
support the preparation of the draft and final repository environmental impact statements in
FY 1999 and FY 2000, respectively.  Through a public rulemaking process, we will begin to
modify the Department of Energy's repository siting guidelines in support of the approach we are
now proposing.
<p>
<b>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation.</b>  The FY 1997 request for our waste
acceptance, storage and transportation activities is $10 million.  It will be used to continue the
administrative and coordination activities that we are responsible for under the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act and to support some progress on non-site-specific initiatives that will address the long
lead time activities that must precede removal of spent nuclear fuel from reactor sites once a
federal facility becomes available.
<p>
<b>Program Management.  </b>The FY 1997 request for program management is $51 million.  This
figure includes $2 million to maintain our quality assurance program, $10 million for human
resources and administration, $9 million for technical and regulatory integration and planning
activities, and $30 million for program direction (including Federal salaries).  Following
Congressional guidance for FY 1996, program management efforts have been reprioritized to
provide support for the completion of core scientific activities and conceptual designs for a
repository at Yucca Mountain, and for the development and implementation of strategies to
improve the program's capability to respond to Congressional direction regarding interim
storage.
<p>
The remainder of my statement reviews in more detail the progress we have made since your
hearing last year, the work we will accomplish during the remainder of FY 1996, and the work
we propose to do with the funds we are requesting for FY 1997.
<p>
		 <b>   1995-1996 ACCOMPLISHMENTS</b>
<p>
<b>Yucca Mountain.</b>  Since I testified before this Committee last March, we have made substantial
progress toward the characterization of the Yucca Mountain site.
<p>
<i>Waste Isolation Strategy. </i> We substantially refined our strategy for the containment and isolation
of radioactive wastes.  The strategy relies on engineered barriers, geologic features, and natural
processes to delay releases of radionuclides to the environment outside of the Yucca Mountain
site and to minimize any exposure to the public.  The strategy is based on the theory that
dissolution and transport of radionuclides would be restricted because of the limited amount of
water moving through the rocks in and around the repository.  In this strategy, a Yucca Mountain
repository would completely contain wastes within the engineered barriers for thousands of years
and minimize doses to the population living near the site for tens of thousands to hundreds of
thousands of years.
<p>
<i>Exploratory Studies Facility.</i>  By increasing the efficiency of tunnel boring machine operations
throughout the year, we made important progress constructing the exploratory studies facility. 
We have completed over one-half (almost three miles) of the planned excavation at Yucca
Mountain and are now tunneling through the proposed repository horizon, significantly ahead of
schedule.  We have passed the location of the first planned Ghost Dance Fault alcove.  We are
making every effort within limits of available funds to continue the progress on the tunnel and
the scientific work associated with it.  Four test alcoves have been excavated to provide scientists
with direct access to the repository setting where they can observe and test major geologic and
hydrologic features of the Yucca Mountain site, and study the geomechanical properties of its
rock and its response to construction activities in the proposed repository setting.  We have
completed construction of the North Portal and have begun excavation of the thermal test alcove. 
<p>
<i>Core Science.</i>  We have appreciably reduced the scientific and technical uncertainty surrounding
the proposed repository site through the analysis of the scientific data we have collected.  Our
results continue to confirm that, consistent with our waste isolation and containment strategy, the
natural system at the site would contribute significantly to waste isolation.
<p>
 <ul>
<li> The rock at the repository level is more competent than had been anticipated.
<li>  The rock is even drier than expected, with no dripping or flowing water.
<li>  Our investigations reveal some indications that ground water flow at the repository horizon  has been very limited for 100,000 years or longer.
<li>   We have found no unexpected geologic features, such as major new faults.
</ul>
<p>
In addition, we found that the Drill Hole Wash structure, identified at the surface as a fault
several tens of meters wide, is a less significant feature at repository depth than expected.  These
observations led to elimination of the need for one planned test alcove, and raises the possibility
that a substantially larger area is available for the repository than was originally assumed.
<p>
<i>Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) Performance.</i>  The efficiency of the underground tunneling
operation has been greatly increased.  Installation of a muck conveyor system in July 1995
allowed us to replace the muck cars used to remove excavated rock during the early phase of
tunnel construction.  The conveyor system has reduced by 30 to 50 percent the time required to
complete the excavation cycle.  In addition, we implemented modifications to the TBM's
steering, hydraulics, gripping capability and cutter head to improve TBM efficiencies.  In
combination with an aggressive management strategy that consolidates outages and minimizes
TBM downtime, the rate of progress has been greatly improved.  Consequently, we have reduced
the cost of construction significantly.
<p>
<i>Performance Assessment.</i>  We completed a performance assessment of the repository system as
we currently envision it.  The performance assessment evaluates the ability of the natural and
engineered barrier systems to meet repository performance objectives.  It indicated that the
man-made features of the repository could provide containment for spent nuclear fuel and
high-level
radioactive waste.
<p>
The results also indicate that, under certain assumptions, the natural processes alone can
contribute to isolation of the radionuclides for a very long time-period.  The analyses tend to
confirm our understanding of the importance of the rate and distribution of ground-water
movement to the performance of the natural system.  A combination of waste package and site
performance can be shown to contribute to containing and isolating radioactive waste within the
Yucca Mountain area for some tens of thousands to even hundreds of thousands of years.
<p>
<i>Regulatory Interactions.</i>  We provided a revised License Application Annotated Outline and
Topical Report II for Seismic Hazards Methodology to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  We
also closed with the Commission on the extreme erosion issue.
<p>
<i>Environmental Requirements.  </i>We completed the repository environmental impact statement
scoping process that will support our work under the National Environmental Policy Act.
<p>
<i>Surface-Based Testing.  </i>During FY 1995, we continued to collect information from our
surface-based testing activities, including data on the properties of the rock at-depth to support
design
and construction of the exploratory studies facility, data on the characteristics of water movement
in the unsaturated and saturated zones, and data relevant to the evaluation of the waste package 
environment.  We continued to monitor precipitation and meteorological conditions, infiltration
from precipitation events, streamflow and runoff, water levels in wells, and seismicity.  We
analyzed groundwater samples to assess their age and the characteristics of infiltration since
nuclear weapons testing began at the Nevada Test Site.  We continued our program to monitor
natural infiltration in unsaturated zone boreholes.  We also completed engineering reports to
identify the proposed repository configuration and we confirmed our understanding of the
geologic structure at the north end of the repository block.
 <p>
<i>Pneumatic Gas Flow.</i>  In response to concerns expressed by Nuclear Regulatory Commission
staff,  the State of Nevada, and Nye County, Nevada, we implemented a program to collect
information on the base-line characteristics of pneumatic gas flow in Yucca Mountain.  We
performed continuous pneumatic monitoring of selected boreholes before, during, and after
tunneling penetration of the non-welded unit of the Paintbrush Tuff.  Results indicate that the
Paintbrush Tuff non-welded unit, which overlies the formation in which the repository would be
constructed, acts as a partial barrier to gas flow.  This pneumatic data confirms the results from
hydrologic investigations, which indicate that the non-welded unit acts as a barrier to water
infiltrating through the overlying units and to divert it away from the repository horizon.  These
results will be utilized in modeling gas flow in a thermally perturbed repository as part of our
next performance assessment.
<p>
<b>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation.</b>  In preparation to move large quantities of
spent nuclear fuel, we have initiated non-site-specific contingency planning to respond to new
policy direction on interim storage.  Work includes the development of a waste acceptance and
national transportation strategy that relies on the private sector for implementation.  The strategy
would utilize commercially available transportation and storage equipment that has been certified
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Our contingency planning also includes the
development of a generic interim storage facility safety analysis to expedite facility licensing and
development time if a site is authorized.
<p>
We completed the packaging of spent fuel hardware for removal from pool storage at the Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory.   Six of the ten Class C waste packages were shipped for
disposal.
<p>
<i>Canister and Cask Development.  </i>A contract for the design and certification of a multi-purpose
canister system was issued to Westinghouse Government and Environmental Services Company
in April 1995.  The initial phase of the three-phase contract covered system design and the
preparation of  three safety analysis reports, the first of which was submitted to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission in April 1996.  In addition, we completed the fabrication of an advanced
technology, high-capacity, legal-weight truck cask half-scale model and completed testing to
verify cask design analyses.  These casks are capable of transporting bare, or uncanistered, spent
fuel from reactors to a storage or disposal facility.  We completed transfer of the multi-purpose
canister environmental impact statement preparation to the Department of the Navy.
<p>
<i>Regulatory Interactions. </i> We submitted a formal report on burn-up credit to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission for review.  Approval of the burn-up credit methodology will lead to
substantially more efficient transport and storage technologies.
<p>
<i>Environmental Requirements.</i>  We issued a multi-purpose canister system environmental impact
statement implementation plan; completed the scoping process for the multi-purpose canister
system environmental impact statement; and developed a preliminary draft multi-purpose
canister environmental impact statement.
<p>
<b>Program Management.</b>  We updated various program control documents such as the Systems
Engineering Management Plan, the Baseline Management Plan, and Test and Evaluation
Management Plan.  We have also issued and began the implementation of our first integrated,
programwide information management strategic plan as a first step toward streamlining and
better integrating our information services.  In September 1995, we revised the program baselines
to reflect the Program Approach and published an updated Total System Life Cycle Cost analysis
of the program.  We updated the Program Cost and Schedule Baselines, the Civilian Radioactive
Waste Management System Requirements Document, and the Program Work Breakdown
Structure.  We also developed a Quality Assurance Transition Plan.
<p>
<i>Human Resources and Business Management.</i>  We completed the consolidation of our major
program participants under the Management and Operating Contractor for better integration and
coordination.  We initiated a procurement for a consolidated technical support services contractor
to improve performance at a reduced level of funding.  We managed a major program revision to
respond to budget reductions (eliminating over 1,000 contractor positions).  We improved our
management systems to provide for more effective utilization of reduced funding and staff.  We
also established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Home Page on the
Internet, which has dramatically improved the public's access to programmatic information.
<p>
<i>Quality Assurance. </i> We completed the initial consolidation of program quality assurance
procedures and developed and implemented a Quality Assurance Transition Plan that
consolidates quality assurance audits.
<p>
	       <b>  REMAINING ACTIVITIES IN FY 1996</b>
<p>
<b>Yucca Mountain. </b> Through the remainder of this fiscal year, we will continue tunneling the
exploratory studies facility and will also initiate the excavation of  two additional test alcoves to
complement the four already completed.  One new alcove will be used for conducting heater tests
to study the response of the ground water and rocks to heat that will be generated by the spent
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  The other new alcove will provide access near the
Ghost Dance Fault to study its hydrologic characteristics and to determine if it acts as a
preferential path of water flow through the repository.  If funding permits, we will complete the
main tunnel excavation at the repository level.
<p>
<i>Core Science.</i>  Attention will continue to be focused on the analysis and documentation of the
substantial amount of data collected to date.  Key models of natural processes, including those
for flow and transport in the saturated and unsaturated zones, will be documented and available
by the end of FY 1996.  This documentation will provide input for the design work and for the
next iteration of total system performance assessment that will support the repository viability
assessment.  Testing in the exploratory studies facility will focus on the hydrologic
characteristics of faults and contacts between different rock units above the repository level.  We
will penetrate and begin testing the Ghost Dance fault at the repository horizon to understand its
role in movement of groundwater through the repository.  We will prepare for the single element
thermal mechanical (heater) test to collect the data needed to determine the stability of
underground openings when subjected to the heat from waste packages.  This test should start
later this calendar year.  In addition, we will issue the repository waste isolation and containment
strategy.
<p>
Only a few surface-based tests were planned for FY 1996.  Those tests focus on the hypotheses in
our waste containment and isolation strategy.  Testing at the C-Well complex will continue to
generate data to characterize groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the saturated zone. 
Monitoring related to characterization of seismicity, meteorological conditions, pneumatic
pathways, and saturated and unsaturated zone hydrology will be continued.  Geologic mapping
will continue as the TBM advances towards completion of the tunnel.
<p>
<i>Repository Advanced Conceptual Design.</i>  We will issue advanced conceptual design reports for
the repository and waste package.  The reports will describe the design process; depict the major
repository configurations, components, and operational concepts; and identify those areas of
design requiring further refinement.  The reports will be prepared in sufficient detail to develop
confidence in the overall design of a repository that could be operated at Yucca Mountain, and to
serve as the basis for the viability assessment designs.
<p>
<i>Performance Assessment. </i> We will complete additional sensitivity analyses of the current
performance assessment to improve our evaluation of the significance to total system
performance of various components of the natural and engineered barriers.  These analyses,
together with the waste containment and isolation strategy, will be used to narrow the scope of
our site characterization and design work by identifying the additional important site and
design-related information required for performance assessments for the viability assessment and
potential licensing.
<p>
If funding is available, we will also initiate a phased peer review of the performance assessment
that will run through 1999.  The comments and recommendations available from each step of the
peer review will be incorporated as appropriate as the total system performance assessment is
developed for the viability assessment.
<p>
<i>Regulatory Process.</i>  We will propose revisions to the Department's Siting Guidelines (10 CFR
Part 960) to focus on the most important aspects of evaluating a single repository site.  Through a
public rulemaking, we will clarify and simplify the procedural aspects of the site characterization
process.  Our proposal will address the most important aspects of evaluating a single repository
site consistent with the Congressional guidance provided by the 1987 amendments to the 
Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and with guidance provided during the FY 1996 appropriations
process.  The proposal will also focus on protecting worker and public health and safety and the
environment.
<p>
<b>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation.</b>  We will continue to collect utility data in
preparation for the acceptance of waste.  We will commence work on and publish a Notice of
Expression of Interest to begin public discussion of the market-driven initiative to create a
national spent nuclear fuel transportation capability.  The development and certification of
advanced technology, legal-weight truck casks will be phased out.  We plan to rely upon
commercially available technologies when the transportation of spent fuel begins.  We will
complete the first phase of Westinghouse multi-purpose canister contract for system design and
preparation of safety analysis reports, and then close out the contract.
<p>
<i>Environmental Requirements. </i> Since work on the development of the multi-purpose canister
system will not continue past the design phase, our work on the environmental impact statement
for the fabrication and deployment of multi-purpose canisters also has been terminated.  Argonne
National Laboratory, our support contractor for development of the environmental impact
statement, has completed the preliminary draft document, which will be available for future
reference. 
<p>
The Navy has decided that it will become the lead agency on an environmental impact statement
covering naval spent nuclear fuel.  The Navy's environmental impact statement will analyze a
container system that will provide for the management of greater than Class C low-level
radioactive waste.  The Department will participate as a cooperating agency.  Since all naval
spent fuel is shipped to and stored at Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, the evaluations will
be specific to that location.
<p>
<i>Dry Transfer System.</i>  We plan to demonstrate the spent fuel dry transfer capability and submit a
topical safety analysis report on its design to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Over the last
few years, we have been working with the Electric Power Research Institute on the design of a
dry transfer system for spent nuclear fuel.  The system will enable the transfer of individual spent
fuel assemblies between conventional, top-loading casks and canister systems.
<p>
The Electric Power Research Institute delivered a final design report to the Department in
December 1995, and a draft Topical Safety Analysis Report was received on March 7, 1996.  We
plan to submit the topical report to Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff later this year for
review and acceptance.  We are currently negotiating an agreement with the Idaho Operations
Office of the Department's Office of Environmental Management regarding a cost-shared project
to fabricate and demonstrate the dry transfer system at the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory.  The system could assist the Department in meeting its near-term spent fuel
management commitments to the State of Idaho.  It could also benefit early operations at any
interim storage facility.  Our intent is to complete prototype fabrication and to start the
demonstration by mid-1998.
<p>
<b>Program Management.</b>  In FY 1996 we will complete our revision to the 1994 Program Plan. 
The revised plan will set forth the revised program strategy, work scope, major milestones, and
schedules in accordance with direction provided with the FY 1996 appropriation.
<p>
<i>Program Integration. </i> Through the remainder of FY 1996, we will continue to improve the
integration of program activities by:  (1) awarding a new integrated technical and management
support contract which will consolidate existing contracts for support of the Federal staff at both
business centers and the management center; (2) consolidating program participant quality
assurance procedures; (3) updating contractual reporting requirements; and (4) implementing a
single, integrated program planning and control system.  In addition, the program will be
managed as one integrated, strategic system in response to the Secretary's new initiative to
strengthen the Department's project management system.
<p>
<i>Defense Waste Fee. </i> In the near future, we will complete and issue the Defense Waste Fee
Adequacy Report, which is used to determine an appropriate defense contribution to the
development of the radioactive waste management systems for the disposal of high-level
radioactive waste.  The fee is based on an our updated estimate of the systems's total life cycle
cost.
<p>
	  <b>  APPLICATION OF THE FY 1997 BUDGET REQUEST</b>
<p>
The budget request for FY 1997 underscores the Administration's continued commitment to
geologic disposal.  The funds requested will allow us to resolve the technical questions
concerning the viability of the construction and operation of a repository at Yucca Mountain by
1998; regain a target of 2002 to file a license application with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission for construction of the repository; and develop the strategies and establish the
capability to quickly respond to new policy directions on interim storage.
<p>
The overall FY 1997 budget request for the program is $400 million, which consists of a $200
million appropriation from the Nuclear Waste Disposal Fund and a $200 million appropriation
for Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal Activities.  This represents an effective increase of $85
million over the amount available to us from the FY 1996 Appropriation of $315 million.
<p>
<b>Yucca Mountain.</b>  The FY 1997 budget request for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization
Project is $339 million, compared to $250 million in FY 1996.  This represents an increase of 
$89 million, more than the total program funding increase we are requesting.
<p>
The FY 1997 funding will be applied most heavily toward work on the critical elements of the
repository evaluation, including the development of an updated total system performance
assessment; design of the repository and waste package in sufficient detail to evaluate its
feasibility and performance; resolution of critical unresolved issues in the waste isolation
strategy, criticality control, and thermal loading; development of site investigation synthesis
reports and updated process models; completion of the excavation for the exploratory studies
facility; and collection of required test data.
<p>
In FY 1997, we will also continue work on updating the regulatory requirements that govern the
repository licensing process and considering the regulatory revisions that would be needed to
clarify our intentions.  The existing regulations were established more than a decade ago and in
different policy and technical settings that exist today.  Since their initial promulgation, an
enormous amount of data has been collected and analyzed at Yucca Mountain.  From that data,
we have gained a more coherent understanding of what is required to complete a technically
defensible license application.  A more directed approach to licensing would allow us to set the
target date for a license application in 2002, given a sustainable level of program funding.
<p>
<i>Operations and Construction.</i>  Operations and construction includes excavation within the
exploratory studies facility; tunnel boring machine operations and maintenance; and the Project's
safety and health program.
<p>
During FY 1997, we will complete the underground five mile exploratory studies facility loop
and the second alcove to provide access to the Ghost Dance fault at the south end.  The
completed loop will allow testing and evaluation of the geology and hydrology of the southern
portion of the proposed repository.  We will complete excavation of the heater test alcove.  We
will construct limited facilities at the north and south portal to support construction and operation
of the exploratory studies facility.  Boreholes will be drilled to provide data for the design of an
east-west drift, if one is needed, and to improve our understanding of the distribution of rock
units and faults in this area.  We will procure contractor support and equipment for construction
of smaller scale drifts at the repository horizon, if necessary. Underground and on-site safety
services will be provided for construction activities as well as environmental management of
hazardous waste accumulation facilities, hydrocarbon contaminated soil maintenance and
disposal, and conducting surveillance of site activities to ensure compliance with environmental
regulations and requirements.  Emergency medical services and fire prevention programs will be
maintained to support field activities.
<p>
<i>Core Science.</i>  Core Science includes scientific test planning and design; collection of scientific
and environmental data; laboratory experiments; site and materials performance testing; and
modeling and data analysis.  These activities are intended to support preparation of the Yucca
Mountain viability assessment, and assuming a positive assessment, a future site
recommendation, NEPA determination, and licensing documentation.
<p>
During FY 1997, additional data collection activities will focus on gaining a better understanding
of the repository's waste containment and isolation capabilities.  This data will be used to
constrain and evaluate flow models for the site.  Additional boreholes will be drilled to provide
information on rock properties, deep stratigraphy and saturated zone to support three dimensional
geologic, hydrologic, tectonic, and volcanism modeling efforts.  Saturated hydrologic zone
testing will be conducted to investigate water movement across faults, to complete tracer tests at
the C-wells, and to study the deep aquifers downstream from the repository block.
<p>
Seismic, stream flow, pneumatic, and meteorological data will be collected to record transient
events such as earthquakes, floods, and major storms.  Additional aquifer tests will be conducted
to characterize the steep hydraulic gradient at the north end of the repository block as input into
the regional saturated zone hydrologic model.   Hydrologic testing in the first Ghost Dance fault
alcove will be initiated to observe potential groundwater flow paths through or past the
repository horizon.  This will provide data crucial to the issue of fast flow paths through the
unsaturated zone.  Hydrologic testing will continue in alcove No. 2 (Bow Ridge Fault) and
alcoves Nos. 3 and 4 (upper and lower contact boundaries of the Paintbrush Tuff non-welded
formation) to study water movement above the repository horizon.  The drift scale heater test will
be installed and the heaters turned on during FY 1997.  The drift scale heater test will be
designed to approximate an actual emplacement drift.  Thermal, hydrologic, geochemical, and
geomechanical parameters will be monitored during the test and data will be used to evaluate
potential impacts on the near field environment.
 <p>
<i>Design and Engineering.</i>  Design and Engineering activities include the coordination and
planning of exploratory studies facility, repository and waste package designs, including waste
form and package modeling; performance testing; quality assurance oversight and training; and
the preparation of program cost estimates.
<p>
During FY 1997, selected aspects of the waste package, surface, and subsurface designs will be
advanced to resolve key issues that will allow us to demonstrate in 1998 that the construction,
operation, and closure of the repository are technically feasible.  The design information we
compile over the next few years will also be the basis for our assessment of the expected
performance of the system in terms of radiological safety and waste isolation.  Outputs of this
design phase will also support the evaluation of the additional design work that may be needed to
support our license application for construction of a repository and the preparation of an updated
cost estimate for construction and operation of a repository.  Waste package enhancements will
include work in fabrication development, probabilistic criticality analysis, materials, and waste
form testing.
<p>
In FY 97, we will also complete the Thermal Loading System Study.  The study will provide the
technical basis to support the decision of how much heat-generating waste can be disposed of in
a given repository area.  The study will evaluate performance, cost and schedule of the thermal
management options.  The study will also indicate how thermal loading flexibility can be
achieved and when decisions must be made so that significant costs or schedule constraints are
not incurred.
<p>
<i>Performance Assessment.</i>  Performance assessment includes the calculations and modeling
associated with total system and subsystem performance analysis; and management and control
of the supporting technical databases.
<p>
Our next assessment of system performance, which is being scheduled for the 1997-1998
time-frame, will be based more directly on the process-level models that we are developing for
the site
and engineered system.  A more sophisticated biosphere model is also expected to be in place to
allow calculation of dose and the associated risk to a representative individual in an affected
population.  The objective for this assessment is to evaluate both the expected performance of the
system as well as the ranges of probabilities of radiation release, dose, and resulting
consequences.
<p>
The 1997-1998 assessment will consider and reflect the site and engineered system process-level
understanding and data available at that time.  It will, therefore, represent the best estimate of
system performance that we are likely to have for some time to come.
<p>
<i>Regulatory Process.</i>  We will reinitiate support activities to regain our target to file a license
application in 2002.  We will issue a final rule revising the repository siting guidelines (10 CFR
Part 960).
<p>
<i>NEPA Compliance. </i> Compliance activities primarily consist of holding scoping meetings;
reviewing and responding to public scoping comments; completion of data gathering;
maintaining technical interfaces; consultations with other agencies and Native American Indian
Tribes; and modeling and impact analysis, all of which would lead to development and issuance
of a draft repository environmental impact statement.  These activities would also be conducted
for the final environmental impact statement (including a public comment response document)
and a Record of Decision.
<p>
Related NEPA activities were suspended in FY 1996.  We will reinitiate them in FY 1997 with
the award of a technical support contract to collect, interpret, and analyze data required for the
preparation and review of the draft and final repository environmental impact statements,
scheduled for completion in FY 1999 and FY 2000 respectively.  In FY 1997, we will also begin
to address NEPA information needs through data collected from our core science, design and
engineering, and performance assessment activities.
<p>
<i>Project Management.</i>  The objective of Project management is to provide the requisite level of
Project control and support at minimum cost to assure that the maximum amount of funds are
available for core science, design and engineering, performance assessment, and NEPA
compliance activities.  Project management includes the planning, budgeting, scheduling and
funds management of all Project activities, facilities operation, site security, administrative
support services, telecommunications and rent payments; records management and computer
procurement, maintenance and operation; operation of local and wide area communication
networks; motor pool operations; and to conduct public information and outreach activities.
<p>
<b>Waste Acceptance Storage and Transportation.</b>  The FY 1997 budget request for Waste
Acceptance, Storage and Transportation is $10.0 million, compared to $13.6 million in FY 1996. 
This category includes five line items from the Congressional Budget submission: Spent Fuel
Storage, Transportation, Waste Acceptance, Multi-Purpose Canister subsystem, and Project
Integration.  The request for Spent Fuel Storage is $2.3 million, compared to $1.0 million in FY
1996; Transportation is $2.5 million, compared to $5.1 million in FY 1996; Waste Acceptance is
$2.7 million, compared to $2.3 million; Multi-Purpose Canister subsystem will be terminated in
FY 1996; and the request for Project Integration is $2.4 million, compared to $3.4 million in FY
1996.
<p>
In FY 1997, the Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation Project will forge a
market-driven waste acceptance and national transportation strategy, and will address the
non-site-specific and long-lead time activities that must precede any near term removal of spent
nuclear
fuel from reactor sites once a Federal facility becomes available.
<p>
<i>Market-Driven Waste Acceptance and Transportation Strategy.</i>  In FY 1997, we plan to begin
discussions with industry on an initiative to create the necessary national transportation capability
to remove spent nuclear fuel from locations throughout the United States to a centralized interim
storage or permanent disposal facility.  An acquisition strategy that relies on the private sector for
transportation and waste acceptance equipment and services will be developed.  We will solicit
Expressions of Interest in one or more publications such as the  <i>Federal Register, Commerce
Business Daily</i>, and trade journals to garner industry and vendor views on the proposed strategy. 
Under this approach, we will be prepared to issue requests for proposals and award fixed-price,
multi-year, performance-based contracts to the private sector for equipment and services to carry
out certain functions under the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or
High-Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR Part 961), to accept spent fuel at utility sites for delivery
to a Federal facility, and to provide the technical and management capability to maintain a
National transportation effort.
<p>
<i>Non-Site-Specific and Long Lead Time Work.</i>  Our non-site-specific work related to storage will
continue in FY 1996 and FY 1997.  We will maintain our standard contracts and interactions
with utilities, continue the collection of utility data, establish the sequence and amounts of spent
fuel to be transferred to the Department, and review utility reports that identify assemblies to be
picked up.  "Long lead time" activities that must precede acceptance, and subsequent shipment,
of spent nuclear fuel from reactor sites will be addressed.  We will integrate Federal spent
nuclear fuel and defense high-level radioactive waste into the program's plans for waste
acceptance, storage, and transportation; and complete a memorandum of agreement with the
Department's Office of Environmental Management to establish the process for determining the
type, quantity, priority, and fee for their spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste.
<p>
Our interim storage readiness capability will be based upon a phased interim storage facility
consistent with the concept developed in Congressional debate.  We will address the technical,
safety, and procedural issues involved in licensing an interim storage facility to expedite the
process and reduce the cost for facility development when an interim storage site is designated. 
An example of this type of activity is a generic topical safety analysis report for the interim
storage facility that should resolve issues and thereby expedite the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission licensing schedule when a specific site is identified.
<p>
<b>Program Management. </b> The FY 1997 budget request for Program Management is $50.7
million, compared to $51.4 million in FY 1996.  This funding includes $1.9 million for Quality
Assurance, $8.1 million for Program Management and Integration, $10.2 million for Human
Resources and Administration, and $30.5 for Program Direction which includes Federal salaries
and administrative support.  The Program Management and Integration component is about 12.6
percent of the total program budget for the year, down from 16.3 percent in FY 1996, and 17.3
percent in FY 1995.  This reflects our continuing efforts to reduce these costs and make a greater
share of our funding available to our two business centers.
<p>
Program Management consists of activities and tasks that support all of the program element
areas.  From an organizational perspective, Program Management elements include the
traditional areas of management and control, quality assurance, systems integration, regulatory
integration, human resources and administration, and Federal salaries.  These elements provide
administrative support and strategic planning for, as well as cross-cutting issues affecting both
the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization and Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation
Projects.
<p>
In FY 1997, an emphasis will be placed on increasing the capability of Federal staff  to function
with a decreasing reliance on contractor support; improving the program's management tools
(e.g., schedules, baselines, change control, performance review, and reporting processes) to
increase the efficiency of applying reduced funding levels to program priorities both in planning
and in operations; addressing a number of cross-cutting technical issues; improving the
functional linkages across the program through increased integration; and improving access to
the data and information needed to effectively manage the program.
<p>
Our quality assurance activities will continue to support the Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization effort, repository design, and the revisions to our technical baselines.  Our
systems integration work will ensure that the interface requirements between the repository and
the interim storage and transportation components of the radioactive waste management system
are adequately addressed and alternative system design proposals are prepared and evaluated.  As
progress is made in site characterization, repository design activities, and transportation and
interim storage efforts, the latest concepts will be incorporated into system operation studies and
models.  These will be used to evaluate the impact of repository design and operational concepts
on the overall waste system.  System cost tradeoffs, waste logistics, and storage options will also
be examined.
<p>
With regard to regulatory integration, we will coordinate and participate in interactions with the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff to address management and technical issues related to the
repository program, interim storage, and the transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level
radioactive waste.  Our planning activities will focus on responding to Administration and
Congressional inquiries regarding program status, policies, and updating the program's policies
and plans.  We will complete the FY 1997 total system life cycle cost report and conduct an FY
1997 Defense Waste Fee Adequacy Analysis and publish the report.  We will also continue to
improve program and project management systems by updating program and project cost and
schedule baselines, schedule networks, and bases of estimates.  In the area of  Human Resources
and Administration, in early FY 1997, we will award a contract for a consolidated technical
support services contractor to improve performance at  reduced funding levels.  We will also
update our quality assurance training course outlines, instruction guides, and lesson plans and
conduct essential quality assurance training; develop and submit the program's annual report to
Congress on FY 1996 activities and expenditures; develop and submit an audited financial
statement for Nuclear Waste Fund management; and continue to integrate information
management activities across program locations.
<p>
		<b> SPECIAL BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS</b>
<p>
<b>Payments to State of Nevada and Units of Local Government.</b>  We do not intend to make FY
1996 payments to the State of Nevada and the units of local government affected by the Yucca
Mountain site characterization project under the provisions of Section 116(c) of the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act (the Act).
<p>
However, as we have informally advised your staff, we do intend to enter into an agreement,
under other authority, with Nye County to perform on-site testing and data gathering activities
that we believe are important to our ongoing characterization efforts.  Maintenance of the
continuity of this scientific work during FY 1996 is important to our program.  The cost of this
work will be approximately $631,000.
<p>
We believe that the support envisioned by Section 116(c) of the Act to the State and units of
local government affected by site characterization activities is important in enabling local
governments and the citizens most directly impacted by the Yucca Mountain Project to remain
informed and to participate in a meaningful way in the day to day program actions that affect
them.  Financial support is particularly important for the rural counties' programs where financial
resources are severely limited.
<p>
We hope to resolve the policy regarding the future funding of the affected governments in the
course of consideration of the FY 1997 budget.
<p>
<b>Cooperative Agreements. </b> The program funds ten formal cooperative agreements with regional,
national and technical organizations to address institutional and technical issues relating to the
transportation, storage, and disposal of commercial spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste. 
Public participation and the exchange of valuable information is facilitated through these
agreements.  Due to budget reductions in FY 1996, we reviewed each of the agreements and
funding for each organization was reduced to about one-third of the FY 1995 level.  Our plan for
FY 1997 is to continue to fund these organizations at these reduced levels.  I am submitting for
the record a table that presents the funding provided to each organization in FY 1995 and FY
1996, and the planned FY 1997 level.
<p>
<b>Dry Storage Research.</b>  The Department maintains spent nuclear fuel in storage casks at the
Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.  This spent fuel has been in dry storage longer than any
other fuel in this country.  The casks are routinely monitored to provide information regarding
the behavior of the spent fuel in storage and could provide valuable information for licensing by
the Commission of extended dry storage.  This work has historically been funded from the
Civilian Radioactive Waste Research and Development Appropriation.  The FY 1996
appropriation did not provide funds to continue this activity and we are not requesting an
appropriation for FY 1997.  We have asked the Department's Office of Environmental
Management staff to consider taking over this project, and remain hopeful that this important
data series can be maintained.
<p>
		       <b> CONCLUDING REMARKS</b>
<p>
With your approval of our FY 1997 budget request, I am confident that the direction we are now
taking will, in the FY 1998 - FY 1999 time frame, answer the important outstanding technical
questions regarding the feasibility of building the repository.
<p>
If there is an aspect of the geologic setting that seriously contradicts our expectations about the
performance of a repository at Yucca Mountain, we are likely to discover it by FY 1998 -
FY 1999.  If there are shortcomings in the available technologies or in our engineering ability to
implement the repository design concepts, they will be evident by then.  With adequate funding
and an updated regulatory process for repository licensing, I am also confident that we can regain
a target date of 2002 for the submittal of a competent license application to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.  The level of funding that we are requesting for FY 1997 will enable us
to embark upon a program with that objective.
<p>
Also, I believe that the concepts that we are developing in FY 1997 for a national transportation
system and an interim storage facility are consistent with the policies expressed by the Congress
and that they will result in the most efficient path forward.
<p>
As we reduce the remaining scientific and technical uncertainties concerning geologic disposal at
Yucca Mountain, society's ability to evaluate the geologic disposal option will become much less
philosophical and much more practical.  It will become very clear by FY 1998 - FY 1999 how the
geologic disposal option compares to alternatives for the long-term management of spent fuel
and other high-level waste forms.  We believe that the responsible course of action is to place the
near-term priority upon completion of the work necessary for a sound assessment of the viability
of the geologic repository.  With that information, we will be able to make a reasoned decision
on the best approach to interim storage in a way that is objective and fair to all our citizens.
<p>
Thank you for your attention.

Statement of Hazel R. O'Leary, Secretary U.S. Department of Energy
</h3>

<p>

<hr>
<h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<body><p>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to appear before you today.  I
understand that the Committee intends to utilize S.1271, introduced by Senator Craig, as the
basis for its markup of a high-level waste bill.  Our administration is opposed to this legislation
for reasons I will elaborate on in this statement.
<p>
The primary emphasis in this bill, as in the similar measure that has been reported by the House
Commerce Committee, is to address the concerns of the institutions that are faced with extended
at-reactor storage of spent fuel from commercial power plants.  Their desire to provide for
removal of spent fuel from reactor sites is well understood.  By 2010, about 55 sites in 30 states
will require new spent nuclear fuel storage capacity for over 11,000 metric tons of uranium
(MTU).
<p>
There is a strong case against  leaving spent fuel at 73 sites in 34 states for several decades or
longer.  As power plants complete their licensed terms and go out of service, we will have
nuclear facilities operated for the sole purpose of spent fuel storage.  This scenario would be "de
facto" public policy to defer a decision on long-term management.  Certainly, no rational case
can be made that this is the preferred long-term management approach.
<p>
We are concerned, however, that the approach adopted in the proposed bill for resolving the
interim storage need is likely to raise new issues for equally important aspects of the national
nuclear waste system.  The bill as drafted assigns priority to an immediate initiative on interim
storage with a highly accelerated schedule.  This requirement coupled with the probable budget
constraints would place the repository program in jeopardy and reduce the policy commitment to
the long-term strategy of geologic disposal. 
<p>
Geologic disposal is the end-point of the federal radioactive waste management system.  A
decision to significantly defer or abandon it would have the effect of making at-reactor or interim
storage of commercial spent fuel the open-ended, long-term strategy.  If technical or institutional
considerations were to prevent supplemental storage, economic and efficient generating capacity
would be prematurely retired to the detriment of the ratepayers, the utility companies and the
national energy outlook.
<p>
Geologic disposal also underpins our efforts to clean-up the radioactive residue of decades of
nuclear weapons production.  The Department has more than 100 million gallons of high-level
radioactive waste that must be processed into tens of thousands of glass canisters requiring deep
geologic disposal.  Geologic disposal is the technical foundation for our international stance on
nuclear nonproliferation and our advocacy of limiting the international trade in weapons
materials.  Our endorsement of the international consensus on geologic disposal sets an example
for the high standards of environmental protection that we wish to promote worldwide.
<p>
Geologic disposal is also the strategy for the ultimate disposition of 65 MTU of spent fuel from
nuclear powered naval vessels, about 2,700 MTU of spent nuclear fuel owned by our
government, and 19 MTU of spent fuel of U.S. origin in foreign research reactors.  If we turn
away from this considered strategy and instead are left with a default strategy of perpetual
managed storage for defense wastes, our objective of encouraging the highest possible global
standards of nuclear safeguards and safety would be undercut.
<p>
Unless the importance of geologic disposal is reflected in the articulation of public policy and in
the funding of the program, we will need to rethink our options for the long-term custody of all
high-level nuclear waste.
<p>
<b>CONCERNS WITH S. 1271</b>
<p>
The objectives of S. 1271 are consistent with the long established Federal obligation to provide
for the long-term custody of the nation's spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. 
Many of the provisions address issues that have arisen through prior efforts to meet this
obligation.  However, we are concerned that an emphasis on establishing an interim storage
facility in the vicinity of the Yucca Mountain site, and at an unreasonably rapid pace, will force
this program into excessively curtailed regulatory processes and unreasonable and logistically
untenable deadlines.  These provisions could also invite unnecessary public opposition to the
objectives of the program.
<p>
We are also concerned that, given the funding priorities for interim storage in S. 1271  and the
likelihood that funding will be constrained there will not be sufficient funding to maintain an
efficient schedule for the geologic disposal program.  The Yucca Mountain project is the only
process to determine if deep geologic disposal can attain public acceptance through an
independent regulatory process in the United States.  The results of that process are essential to
the credibility of the commitment we have made to weapons system cleanup and probably will
have important consequences for the options we are considering for the stabilization and
elimination of weapons grade materials as well. 
<p>
The bill's provisions mandate the immediate construction of a facility for the interim storage of
commercial spent fuel.  The facility is scheduled to begin operations in phases by January 1998,
at a designated location near the Yucca Mountain site.  The President has expressed his
opposition to the peremptory designation of Nevada as a site for an interim storage facility.  The
national policy, expressed in existing law, is that Nevada should be excluded from consideration
as an interim storage site.  The selection of any site for an interim storage facility deserves to be
based upon objective analysis using substantive criteria.  Furthermore, the relative merits of
selecting Nevada as an interim storage site would certainly be influenced by the probability that
the repository will also go forward.  That probability cannot be evaluated at this time. 
<p>
S. 1271 provides for the continuation of site characterization activities at Yucca Mountain, and
for the licensing and development of a repository if the site is found suitable.  In the event of
constrained funding, however, the licensing, construction, and operation of the repository are
designated to have a lower priority than the interim storage facility and its associated
transportation system.  Because the measure does not change the budgetary treatment of the
Nuclear Waste Fund collections, it seems likely that the funding for the repository determination
will be constrained as the requirements of an interim storage initiative increase.
<p>
<b>PROPOSED COURSE OF ACTION</b>
<p>
Our Administration continues to believe that completion of the scientific studies on Yucca
Mountain is the most sensible and principled course of action.  If Yucca Mountain is found
suitable and meets the test of licensing,  provision could have been made to take waste at the site
in a receiving facility as early as 2004.  The fiscal year 1996 budget submitted by the
Administration would have supported this approach.  However, funding constraints imposed by
the fiscal year 1996 appropriations appear to have foreclosed this schedule.
<p>
Faced with those realities, we suggest that the following principles be adopted in legislation. 
These principles will maintain momentum for permanent disposal, address the interim storage
issue, and recognize the realities of the budget outlook.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Provide adequate funding to resolve the major remaining technical uncertainties at
  Yucca Mountain.
<li>     Revise repository regulatory structure to reflect current circumstances.
<li>     Select any interim storage site based on objective criteria.
<li>     Initiate generic interim storage activities.
<li>     Protect environment, safety and health.
</ul>
<p>
First, we must fund a program at an adequate level so that an informed judgment can be made of
the viability of licensing and constructing a deep geologic repository at the Yucca Mountain site. 
This judgment must include not only a scientific understanding of the geologic setting, but also
an engineering design that confirms that technologies are in hand that can carry out the design
concepts, and that the cost and capacity of the potential repository will make it a practical
undertaking.
<p>
Second, we must revise the regulatory structure that guides the licensing of the repository to
reflect the policy changes adopted since enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the realities
of the budgetary constraints on the program, and the experience of the past decade of work.  We
must eliminate unnecessary or duplicative requirements that make the cost of repository
characterization excessive.  In doing this, we will focus on the safety considerations of the
proposed project itself.
<p>
If the repository regulatory basis is updated to accommodate a more focused approach, and a
judgment is made in 1998 that the repository is a practical venture, a license application could be
submitted  to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by 2006, which could result in emplacement
of waste in a repository beginning in 2015.  Our former targets for a license application in 2001
and emplacement in 2010 are nullified by the severe budget reductions in the FY 1996
appropriation.
<p>
Third, the selection of any site for an interim storage facility should be based upon the weighing
of objective criteria, including cost and social impacts; the technical evaluation of the risk to
public and worker health, safety, the environment; and the views of local stakeholders.  The
consideration of Nevada as a candidate site, or the determination of the need to consider other
candidate sites, should await the results of the 1998 viability assessment of the repository.
<p>
Fourth, consistent with the approach adopted by the Congress in FY 1996, the program should be
authorized and directed to initiate generic work toward early waste acceptance.  This work would
include requests for proposals for procurements to underwrite the investment necessary for the
private sector to develop the capability to carry out the transportation effort that will be required
for spent fuel removal from reactor sites nationwide.  It could also include the non site-specific
engineering work, such as the Topical Safety Analysis Report, needed to begin the licensing
process with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Considerable progress could be made on
these two long lead time requirements in the period prior to the designation of an interim storage
site.
<p>
And most importantly, any legislation to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act must retain the
standards and procedures required to assure public and worker health and safety and
environmental protection.
<p>
<b>STATUS OF THE HIGH-LEVEL WASTE PROGRAM</b>
<p>
<b>Program Accomplishments</b>
<p>
The program accomplishments over the past year represent significant progress toward the
requirements of the proposal I have outlined.
<p>
In December 1994, we adopted a new program approach that was based on our own critical
examination of the civilian radioactive waste management program and on direction and
recommendations from the program's oversight, regulatory, and technical review organizations;
and feedback from concerned program stakeholders.  As an expression of support for the new
approach, the Congress agreed to a 40 percent increase in fiscal year 1995 funding to initiate it. 
Almost all of that increase was allocated to the Yucca Mountain Project.
<p>
Since that time we have made real, measurable progress towards geologic disposal.  We utilized
the entire increase, completing the fiscal year with very little carry-over and with
accomplishments that often exceeded our targets.  Our tunnel boring machine is two miles into
the Yucca Mountain site and well ahead of our planned schedules.  We recently completed the
turn into the proposed repository formation and have completed four scientific testing alcoves. 
These alcoves provide our scientists with direct access to the geologic features that must be
evaluated to determine the site's suitability for geologic disposal.
<p>
With adequate funding, we were scheduled in 1998 to make a determination of the suitability of
the Yucca Mountain site for geologic disposal and in 2001, if the site were found suitable, to
submit a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for an authorization to
construct the repository.  Waste emplacement would have commenced in 2010.
<p>
<b>The FY 1996 Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act</b>
<p>
The FY 1996 appropriation for the civilian radioactive waste management program is far short of
what we had requested.  The Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act of 1996,
provides a total of $400 million for the program.  However, $85 million of the total appropriation
has been reserved to be used for an interim storage facility and would become available for
expenditure only upon enactment of new statutory authority.  Funds to implement the current
program are, therefore, effectively reduced to $315 million.  The consequence is a 50% cut in the
FY 1996 request for the program ($630 million) and a 40% reduction from the FY 1995 level of
expenditure ($522 million).  Based on Congressional guidance, we have allocated $250 million
of the available funds to preserve our core scientific work at the Yucca Mountain site.
<p>
Prior to the recent appropriation action, we were on track to meet our major milestones,
culminating in emplacement of spent nuclear fuel in a repository by 2010.  That program
approach is no longer feasible.  The $315 million appropriation this year does not support the
program approach.
<p>
As directed by the Congress in the Conference report on the FY 1996 Energy and Water
Development Appropriation Act, we plan to address the major unresolved technical questions
regarding the conceptual design of the repository and its expected performance in a geologic
setting.  Consistent with the guidance, we have defined a new deliverable for the Yucca
Mountain Project which would take the form of a "Viability Assessment."  This package of
deliverables, included in a report to the Congress, would provide the requisite information for a
determination in the 1998-1999 time frame of the viability of continuing with the licensing of a
geologic repository at the Yucca Mountain site.  This work will resolve the critical current
uncertainties.  With appropriate policy and funding support, we can regain a license application
target, but at a later date.
 <p>
<b>CONCLUDING REMARKS</b>
<p>
In closing, I urge you to consider our principles as you mark-up S. 1271.  My staff and I are
prepared to work with you as your deliberations proceed. 
<p>
I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.

<title>Dreyfus speech to Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Lands
                      Resources Committee</title>
<a name="top">
<h2>REMARKS BY DANIEL A. DREYFUS, DIRECTOR</h2><br>
<h3>OFFICE OF CIVILIAN RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT<br>
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY</h3><br>
<h5>AT THE<br>
<b>UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</b><br>
OCTOBER 10, 1995</h5>
<p>

<body><b>Introduction</b>
<p>
Good morning Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee.  I am Daniel A. Dreyfus,
Director of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management.  At your request, I am pleased to address today the "Integrated Spent Nuclear
Fuel Management Act" (H.R. 1020).
<p>
The Administration has not yet developed a formal position on H.R. 1020.  My testimony will
be limited, therefore, to the history and status of the existing program and the practical
considerations of the proposed legislation.
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>
The U.S. has an inventory of spent nuclear fuel produced by some 118 operating and
shutdown nuclear reactors in 34 states.  Existing storage facilities at commercial utility reactor
sites are reaching their full capacities.  Today, seven utilities are providing additional dry
storage for some 600 metric tons of uranium (MTU).  By 2010, the earliest time in which we
could expect to begin to emplace waste in a geologic repository, the figures will rise to 55
utility reactor sites in 30 states needing dry storage for about 11,000 MTU.
<p>
Without a centralized storage or disposal facility, extended at-reactor storage for many decades
could become necessary.  This is a scenario that was never envisioned by the communities
near existing nuclear power plants, the state public utility commissions that authorized
investments in those power plants, the utilities who constructed them, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission that licensed them, or the Congress, which established Federal responsibility for
accepting the waste.  Consequently, as reactor sites require more storage on-site, technical
constraints or local opposition could threaten the ability of some utilities to continue the
operation of otherwise efficient and economic generating units.  It is worth noting, however,
that the Commission has determined that extended storage at existing commercial reactor sites,
if properly undertaken in accordance with Commission requirements, does not threaten public
health and safety.
<p>
Without a storage or disposal facility, there will be no path forward for the high-level
radioactive waste resulting from the clean-up of many of our nuclear weapons production sites,
the receipt of foreign research reactor spent fuel of U.S. origin, and other high-level
radioactive wastes owned by the federal government.
<p>
<b>The Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program</b>
<p>
In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), confirming the Federal
responsibility to manage the disposal of commercial spent fuel and adopting the strategy of
geologic disposal as the long-term solution.  Later, in 1985, the President determined that
defense-related high-level wastes would also be disposed of in a geologic repository. 
Additional materials for disposal include spent nuclear fuel of U.S. origin from foreign
research reactors and spent nuclear fuel owned by our government, including spent fuel from
nuclear powered naval vessels.
<p>
The NWPA included provisions to finance the nuclear waste program through a fee on
consumers of nuclear energy.  This financing approach preserves intergenerational equity by
providing resources for the management of nuclear waste in a manner that does not impose
undue burdens and risks on future generations.
<p>
The commercial or civilian portion of the program is funded through appropriations from the
Nuclear Waste Fund, which is collected from  the ratepayers of nuclear-generated electricity. 
Contributions to the fund are approximately $600 million per year.  To date, the fund has
received over $8 billion (including interest) and the program has spent about $4 billion.  About
$1.7 billion of this amount has financed the on-going site suitability evaluation of the Yucca
Mountain candidate repository site in Nevada.  The portion of the programs cost estimated to
be
associated with the disposal of defense-related waste is covered by other appropriations of
general funds.
<p>
In 1987, the Congress amended the NWPA.  Among its other provisions, the amendment
directed the Department to limit the repository program to the evaluation of the Yucca
Mountain sites suitability for geologic disposal.  The amendment restricted the Departments
authority to site and develop an interim storage facility.
<p>
With regard to the status of our activities at the Yucca Mountain site, our 25-foot-diameter,
720-ton tunnel boring machine (TBM) was delivered, assembled, and tested for start-up on
September 19, 1994.  As of October 2, 1995, our TBM was 6,569 feet into Yucca Mountain,
more than 2,350 feet ahead of schedule.  We have completed more than one-fifth of the tunnel
that we proposed in our program plan.  Our progress into the mountain has permitted our
scientists to begin direct observation and testing of the sites geologic features.  Three
underground test alcoves have been completed with another one currently under construction. 
With appropriations that meet planned funding levels, the current program approach calls for
the completion in 1997 of the remaining portions of the tunnel and associated test alcoves and
drifts.
<p>
In our surface-based testing program, we have also met all of our goals for fiscal year 1995. 
We have implemented a systematic drilling program that is providing us with data to create a
3-dimensional geophysical model of the Yucca Mountain site.
<p>
Our Program Plan, which assumes the budgeted fiscal year 1996 appropriation of $630 million, includes a
target date for a Departmental conclusion about the technical suitability of the Yucca Mountain
site in 1998.  This will accommodate a target date for a license application to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission in 2001, receipt of a construction authorization from the Commission
in 2004, and the initial emplacement of spent nuclear fuel in 2010.
<p>
There is no current authority under the NWPA to initiate action on interim storage at a specific
site.  Our program, however, includes a set of activities that are relevant to the acceptance of
spent fuel.  They include on-going relations with the utilities and other federal organizations,
preliminary planning for the nationwide transportation system that will be required, and the
development of the next generation of transportation and storage technology, the multi-purpose
canister system.
<p>
<b>Summary of H.R. 1020 Provisions</b>
<p>
H.R. 1020 directs the Departments Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program to
expedite the development of an interim storage facility near the Yucca Mountain site to
facilitate the Departments acceptance of commercial spent nuclear fuel by 1998.  It directs the
Department to continue site characterization for a permanent repository, and designates the
construction of a rail spur from the mainline rail line at Caliente, Nevada, to the interim
storage facility site.  It also specifically eliminates funding for the multipurpose canister
system.
<p>
H.R. 1020 does not require the Department to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for
the interim storage facility.  The bill does, however, direct the Department to prepare an
Environmental Impact Statement for construction and operation of the rail spur.  It also directs
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement to
accompany its licensing action associated with the interim storage facility.  It authorizes
acceptance of defense waste, foreign research reactor spent fuel, and spent fuel from shut-down reactors when the acceptance rate pursuant to the existing disposal contracts between the
Department and the utilities has been achieved.
<p>
With regard to program funding, the bill states that annual fees shall match the annual level of
appropriations less prior year carryover and defense appropriations, and that waste fees
received after its enactment go directly to the Treasury rather than the Nuclear Waste Fund.
<p>
<b>Federal Land Withdrawal</b>
<p>
<b>Land Withdrawal Within the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program</b>
<p>
The NWPA, as amended, does not address the withdrawal of federal land.  There has been no
land withdrawal for the scientific and technical investigation of the Yucca Mountain site. 
Administrative land withdrawal, as provided for under the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act, has a maximum 40-year withdrawal period; therefore the construction of a
geologic
repository at the Yucca Mountain site would require legislative action for the permanent withdrawal of land
for this purpose.
<p>
The Yucca Mountain site comprises a mix of federal lands under the jurisdiction of the
Department of the Interior.  Some of these lands have already been withdrawn for use by other
federal agencies, including the U.S. Air Force and the Department of Energy.  The ongoing
characterization of the Yucca Mountain site is taking place through agreements with these
agencies.
<p>
Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  The Department has a right-of-way reservation (N-47748) from the BLM that includes lands west of the Nevada Test Site and south of the Nellis
Air Force Range.  The Department has assigned this reservation to its Nevada Operations
Office.  The reservation will expire in 2001.
<p>
In September of 1990, the BLM withdrew mineral rights within the area of Right of Way
Reservation N-47748 from operation of the mining and mineral leasing laws.  This action was
taken to prevent mining claims from being staked over the repository block and does not
provide any additional land use rights.
<p>
U.S. Air Force.  The Nellis Range was withdrawn for the Air Force by the Military Land
Withdrawal Act of 1986.  This withdrawal expires in 2001.  The Department has a right-of-way reservation (N-48602) for a portion of the Nellis Range, located north of the land
reserved under N-47748 and west of the test site.  This reservation has also been assigned to
the Departments Nevada Operations Office.  It too will expire in 2001; however,  the Air
Force has already started the process to renew it.
<p>
The Department of Energy.    The BLM withdrew land from the public domain for the
Departments Nevada Test Site in four parcels beginning in 1952.  The Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization Office has established a Memorandum of Agreement with the Departments
Nevada Operations Office for use of the western part of Area 25 of the Nevada Test Site.
<p>
<b>Land Withdrawal Under H.R. 1020</b>
<p>
The land withdrawals proposed in H.R. 1020 generally follow the provisions of the Federal
Land Policy and Management Act.  They are, however, not subject to its limitations and
restrictions.
<p>
Section 201 of H.R. 1020 addresses land withdrawal and the acquisition of rights-of-way for
the railroad spur and the intermodal transfer facility.  It directs the Secretary to acquire rights-of-way and withdraw public lands as necessary within the Caliente route for the construction
and operation of transportation facilities and associated activities.  It also directs the Secretary
to provide for the replacement of land and city wastewater disposal activities necessary to
commence intermodal transfer activities no later than January 31, 1998.  Section 206 addresses
land withdrawal for the repository and interim storage facility.
<p>
Sections 201 and 206 direct the Secretary to publish, within six months of the bills enactment, 
Federal Register Notices containing legal descriptions of the Caliente route, the sites and
rights-of-way to be acquired for the intermodal transfer facility, and the land to be withdrawn
for the interim storage facility.  With regard to the geologic repository, Section 206 further
requires the Secretary to publish, concurrent with the application to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission for authority to construct a repository, a Federal Register Notice containing a
legal description of the Yucca Mountain site.
<p>
Sections 201 and 206 also direct the Secretary to file copies of the aforementioned legal
descriptions and maps depicting transportation routes, sites and rights-of-way to be acquired,
and lands to be withdrawn with all or some of the following groups:  the Congress, the
Secretary of the Interior, the Archivist of the United States, the Governor of Nevada, the
Board of Lincoln County Commissioners, the Board of Nye County Commissioners, and the
Caliente City Council.
<p>
<b>Concluding Remarks</b>
<p>
The program would need to seek Congressional land withdrawal authority for the geologic
repository site and the necessary transportation access routes sometime in the future, should
the site be found suitable for repository development.  In view of the complexities of the
Federal land ownership patterns in and around the Yucca Mountain site, if additional authority
for the program is enacted to provide for interim storage, a related rail access spur, and an
intermodal transfer facility, that legislation should also provide for the necessary withdrawal of
public land.  Failure to provide these lands could lead to protracted delays in realizing the
intent of the legislation.
<p>
In closing, again, I would note that my remarks should not be construed as an official
endorsement of the overall legislation.  The Administration has not taken a position on H.R.
1020 at this time.</body>

</NOBR>
<BODY>

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

Thank you for the opportunity to speak to the Board today about the program.  You will be hearing from several members of my staff on topics you have asked us to address at this meeting.  I will use my time this morning to give you a brief overview of the program status and outlook, and then to address the "viability assessment," a major strategic concept that I believe requires clarification.  I am seeking your assistance in communicating the concept to the broader community of interest.

<H3>BACKGROUND</H3>

When I last addressed the Board, the program was in transition.  During the past nine months, we have revised our program plan to manage our 1996 funding reduction and to regain a strategy that is consistent with the realities of the budget and with the Administration's policy for the program.  We published the revised program plan in May of 1996.  It was supported by the President's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request, and it has been endorsed by the Congress in the subsequent Appropriations Act. <P>
<P>
During the past year, we have continued to make substantial progress in constructing the exploratory studies facility despite the disruption of the downsizing required to manage the unanticipated funding reduction.  Because of the reduction, we were not able to optimize our Fiscal Year 1996 activity.  The need to manage cash flow on a daily basis and the uncertainties of termination costs required us to forgo or delay some expenditures that would have resulted in greater production.  The tunnel boring machine has, however, passed through the repository level and the turn toward the south portal.  Although we will gain important information in the last mile of tunneling, which is in the East-West direction, the greater emphasis now will be on the penetration of the Ghost Dance Fault, the heater tests, and other aspects of data collection in the repository formation.  We completed the main access and observation drift for the heater alcove and we began a small-scale (single-element) heater test on August 26.  Construction of the two alcoves that will provide access to the Ghost Dance fault is also in progress.

<H3>CURRENT STATUS</H3>

<H3>Budget</H3>
In the Fiscal Year 1997 appropriation, Congress provided $382 million for the program and stipulated that no oversight funds are to be provided to the State of Nevada or affected units of local government.  This amount is $18 million less than the Administration's request, of which $11 million is associated with support for the State and Counties.  The Congress instructed that the remaining reduction of $7 million is to be taken from program management and cooperative agreements, and it will be.  It will not impact the program plan, but it will impact other aspects of our activities, such as institutional work, and we will have to manage the program with much less contractor support.  You should be aware that we are, at the same time, reducing Federal staff.  We have been able to meet our Fiscal Year 1996 staffing target without involuntary separations, but meeting the lower 1997 target is likely to require an involuntary reduction-in-force.

<H3>Interim Storage</H3>
Congress adjourned without completion of legislation addressing the near-term management of spent nuclear fuel.  This means, of course, that there is no authorization for siting a specific interim storage facility.  In my judgement, completed legislative action on this issue is unlikely in the first year of the next Congress.<P>
<P>
Any future scenario of interim storage or disposal, however, will require a national transportation effort.  Consequently, the program will continue developing its market-driven waste acceptance, storage, and transportation approach that relies on a procurement process to acquire these services.  This activity will provide a forum that will help to resolve many of the policy and institutional issues confronting orderly initiation of transportation.  It will also enlighten the policy makers regarding the realities of this unprecedented logistical undertaking.<P>
<P>
We will also complete a topical safety analysis report for a generic interim storage facility.  The interactions with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding this report will also provide an important issue resolution forum.

<H3>Yucca Mountain</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Excavating the remainder of the exploratory studies facility main, U-shaped, five-mile loop and constructing all major underground test alcoves.<P>

<LI>Initiating support activities to regain a target to file a license application in 2002.<P>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Nuclear Waste Policy Act Site Approval Process</H3>

Now I will invite your attention to an aspect of our strategic plan that seems to require more discussion.  That is, the concept of a "viability assessment" in 1998.<P>
<P>
<A HREF="fig-1096.htm">[see figure 1]</A><P>
<P>
This slide illustrates the decision process leading to the development of the repository.  Most of the fundamental requirements for this process are set forth in statutes - the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, and the more recent requirements of the Fiscal Year 1997 Energy and Water Appropriations Act.<P>
<P>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act designates the Secretary's site recommendation to the President as the Department's principal programmatic decision point for proceeding with repository development.  This decision point is a final agency action and will be subject to judicial review.  In our revised program plan, we expect to achieve the site recommendation milestone in 2001.  It is important to remember that the Secretary's responsibility prior to that decision is to evaluate the site.  The Act provides that the Director, and thus the program, shall carry out this function.  The Act also provides that, "If  the Secretary at any time determines the Yucca Mountain site to be unsuitable for development as a repository, the Secretary shall (A) terminate all site characterization activities at such site; (B) notify the Congress, the Governor and legislature of Nevada of such termination and the reasons for such termination; . . ." and within six months recommend a new path forward.<P>
<P>
Although the diagram presumes continuing progress to a license application and beyond, the Secretary currently is in the position of being the first judge of site suitability and may stop the action with a negative decision at any point, and without external concurrence.  The Secretary does not become an advocate of the proposed repository until a positive site recommendation decision is made.<P>

<H3>Site Approval Process</H3>

<A HREF="fig-1096.htm">[see figure 2]</A><P>
<P>
The Act details the requirements for the site recommendation.  Prior to any decision to recommend the Yucca Mountain site, the Act requires that the Secretary hold public hearings in the vicinity of the site and notify the State of Nevada of the proposed recommendation.  The Act also requires the Secretary to provide a comprehensive statement of the basis for the site recommendation and specifies the nature of the information that must be submitted to the President and made available to the public.  This information includes a description of the proposed repository and waste form or packaging, and a discussion of the data from the site characterization activity relating to the safety of the site.<P>
<P>
The Act also requires the formal participation of external parties.  The Department must seek the comments of Nevada and other affected governments on the proposed recommendation.  In addition, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must provide preliminary comments on the sufficiency of the site characterization analyses for inclusion in a license application.  The Department must also complete the required public process for development of a repository environmental impact statement consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as modified by the specific direction provided in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.<P>
<P>
If, following the Secretary's recommendation, the President considers the Yucca Mountain site to be qualified to apply for a construction authorization, the President will submit a recommendation of the site to Congress along with the information provided by the Secretary.  The President's recommendation to Congress will be effective 60 days after it is submitted, unless the State of Nevada submits a notice of disapproval to Congress.  If  a notice of disapproval is submitted, the site will be disapproved unless Congress passes a resolution approving the site that becomes law.  If the site is approved, the Secretary must submit an application for a construction authorization to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission not later than 90 days after the date the site designation is effective.<P>
<P>
There are, of course, very specific requirements that must be met for the license application to be docketed by the Commission, and the Commission will be the arbiter of the application's adequacy.  Subsequently, we will have to support our application throughout a licensing process that is certain to include adversarial intervenors and possible litigation.<P>

<H3>Viability Assessment</H3>

It is clear that the site recommendation represents a solemn and consequential decision point.  The adequacy of the judgement and the required supporting documentation are not established only by the standards of the program.  They must also meet the formal requirements of the Act and survive the scrutiny of external participants in an extended public decision process.<P>
<P>
The viability assessment is not the same thing.  If it were, we would simply make the site recommendation decision 34 months earlier and save $850 million.  Rather, the viability assessment is a step along the way.  It is a management tool for the program and a major informational input to the policy process. <P>
<P>
<P>Based upon the decade or more of data gathering, analysis and conceptualization that have already been done, and by placing emphasis upon the most significant remaining issues, we can, by September of 1998, compile a comprehensive description of the design and operational concept for the repository.  We can assess the performance of that concept in the geologic setting.  We can accompany that conceptual presentation with a cost estimate and a plan for completing the license application.<P>
<P>
In my opinion, such a comprehensive description of the proposal is essential for the rational completion of the site recommendation.  It will focus the final years of the site investigation and facility design on the important uncompleted work and the unresolved issues, and it will provide all participants with a frame of reference for their evaluation of the project.<P>
<P>
We will not be finished with our evaluation of the site in 1998 and the Secretary will not be in a position to make a positive site recommendation.  Consideration of the comprehensive concept will, for the first time, put many singular data points into a comprehensive perspective that we do not now have.  This could, of course, become the occasion for a negative decision by the Secretary.  If the compilation of the viability assessment does not result in a negative decision, however, no decision will be made, except the decision we make every morning to continue the site investigation.<P>
<P>
The viability assessment will give all participants a better comprehension of the repository venture and the significance of the data then available.  It will also give policy makers information about the probability that a repository is a viable undertaking.  The President has stated that this information should be available before the siting of an interim storage facility is decided upon.<P>
<P>
The Congress has required the viability assessment to be completed in September of 1998, as set forth in the revised program plan.  As required by the appropriations act, the viability assessment will include four components:<P>

<OL>
<LI>"the preliminary design concept for the critical elements for the repository and waste package;<P>

<LI>a total system performance assessment, based upon the design concept and the scientific data and analysis available by September 30, 1998, describing the probable behavior of the repository in the Yucca Mountain geological setting relative to the overall system performance standards;<P>

<LI>a plan and cost estimate for the remaining work required to complete a license application; and<P>

<LI>an estimate of the costs to construct and operate the repository in accordance with the design concept."
</OL>
<P>
As we implement this plan, it is important that the distinctions between the viability assessment and the site recommendation be appreciated and preserved.  Each has a purpose.  I contend that each can appropriately serve its purpose.  If, however, we turn the viability assessment into a final "go" or "no-go" decision, then either it will be premature or else it cannot be completed as planned.  The viability assessment is required for two purposes: first, to guide the completion of the work required for a site recommendation; and, second, to provide policy makers with a better estimate of the viability of a repository in the time frame required for decision making. <P> 
<P>
There seems to be a psychological need on the part of many to convert the viability assessment into a formal, final decision.  That has not been done in any formal document, but it keeps recurring in casual conversation and in informal written commentary.  Those of us who are obliged to spend serious time on the program must try to keep the distinction clear.  If we do not, we may find that misunderstandings on the part of policy makers have become expectations and that those expectations have distorted the character of the decision process.  I seek the Board's assistance in keeping the distinctions clear.<P>

<H2>CONCLUSION</H2>

The Program has put forth and is implementing a credible plan that maintains the momentum toward a national decision on the geologic disposal option.  With continued adequate funding and an updated regulatory framework for the site recommendation decision, we can meet the schedule we have established for the decision process.<P>
<P>
Thank you for the opportunity to brief the Board.  I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.<P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>


Chairman Jackson and Members of the Commission:<P>
<P>
When I spoke with you in January, the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program was in transition.  During the past seven months, we have revised our program approach to manage our 1996 funding reduction and to develop the long-term plan presented in the Administration's fiscal year 1997 budget request.  The results of this effort are described in the revised Program Plan released in draft form in June.<P>
<P>
We have retained the objective adopted in fiscal year 1995 to reach early convergence on the major scientific and engineering aspects of the investigation of the Yucca Mountain site.  Since January, we have also regained a long range plan that includes target dates for determining the site's suitability for recommendation for a geologic repository and, if the site designation is permitted to take effect, for submitting a license application to the Commission.  Our ability to achieve these targets, however, will continue to depend on the funding we receive in future years and the success of our approach to evaluating site suitability.  Our approach will be described in a proposed revision to the Department's siting guidelines that will be issued shortly.  It focuses on overall system performance as the basis for decisions about site suitability and repository development.<P>
<P>
Simply stated, a site cannot be judged to be "suitable" in the abstract.  At this point in the program, the only logical measure of the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site is that it be able to host a repository design that will meet the applicable standards for the protection of public health and safety.  Attributes of the site that significantly influence that capability are important.  Attributes that do not are irrelevant.  The important attributes can only be identified and evaluated within the context of an assessment of the performance of the proposed engineered repository in the specific geologic setting, as we understand that setting based on the scientific investigations done over the past decade.  Criteria of suitability, therefore, have no logical significance in isolation from a system performance assessment.<P>
<P>
Our revised program plan also defines a program of non site-specific activities that will address the long lead-time requirements of interim storage and spent fuel transportation.  These activities are consistent with the Administration's position on siting an interim storage facility.<P>


<H2>Recent Developments</H2>


<H3>Geologic Disposal</H3>


Excavation of the exploratory studies facility at Yucca Mountain continues at a satisfactory pace.  The information gained from this exploration is enhancing our understanding of the site and of the characteristics important to its potential performance as a geologic repository.<P>
<P>
We completed excavation of the main drift of the exploratory studies facility on July 2, well ahead of schedule, and the tunnel boring machine is now making the turn to proceed up the south ramp.  As of August 27, the tunnel boring machine has completed 6,294 meters (20,643 feet) of the nearly 7,900-meter (nearly 25,800-foot) loop from the north portal to the south portal of the exploratory studies facility.  Approximately 2,400 meters (7,800 feet) of this advance occurred since we met in January.  Funding constraints in fiscal year 1996 have restricted progress on tunneling somewhat, but we expect to reach the south portal of the exploratory studies facility early in 1997.<P>
<P>
We completed the initial construction phase of the thermal-testing alcove in April, and the main access and observation drift for this alcove was completed in May.  We began a small-scale (single-element) heater test in a section of this alcove on August 26.  Construction of the first of the two alcoves that will provide access to the Ghost Dance fault is well underway.  The first phase of this excavation was completed to the planned distance of 90 meters (290 feet) from the main drift on August 23.  Initial exploratory drilling in this alcove should begin this month.  Construction of the second alcove should begin in October 1996.<P>
<P>
Progress in constructing the exploratory studies facility provides our scientists the opportunity to study the geologic and hydrologic characteristics of Yucca Mountain at the depth of the potential repository.  What we have observed is consistent with the general understanding of the geology of the site that we obtained through our surface-based studies.  The structural features observed underground generally can be correlated with the faults observed at the surface.  In addition, structures at the northern end of the main tunnel, such as the Drill Hole Wash fault, are generally less significant features at repository depth than expected.  The information we have obtained indicates that there may be more area available for use at the northern end of the repository block than anticipated. <P>
<P>
Several months ago, we reported the observation of a zone of more highly fractured rock that extends for about 1,000 meters along the southern part of the main tunnel.  Preliminary information obtained from a nearby borehole indicates that the zone of fracturing does not penetrate the overlying rock units.  Although the existence of the fracture zone was not apparent from surface-based studies, such a zone is not unexpected given the geologic history and characteristics of the site.  The lack of surface evidence for this structural zone indicates that it probably formed before the uppermost rock unit was deposited, more than 12 million years ago.  The primary questions at this point relate to the extent and characteristics of the fracture zone and to the influence these characteristics may have on the repository layout and the flow of water to and through the repository.  Studies of the geologic and hydrologic characteristics of this zone, and its potential significance to repository performance, will continue as construction of the exploratory studies facility proceeds.<P>
<P>
Isotopes such as carbon-14, tritium, uranium-series elements, and chlorine-36, are being used to date fracture-fill materials and pore-water samples collected in the exploratory studies facility and from boreholes.  This testing provides data on the age of the water at various locations and on the travel time of water through preferential flow-paths, such as faults and fractures.  The data indicate that most of the water currently distributed in the rock at the potential repository horizon is old, on the order of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years.<P>
<P>
In April, we reported detecting elevated levels of chlorine-36 in some rock samples collected from the exploratory studies facility.  Recognizing the possible existence of preferential flow-paths that could allow more rapid water movement, we conducted a comprehensive sampling program, collecting samples both systematically along the tunnel and at locations defined by specific features such as faults and discrete fractures.  All of the systematic samples and most of the feature-specific samples contained background levels of naturally produced chlorine-36 that indicate ground-water ages of several thousands to several hundreds of thousands of years, consistent with results from other studies.  Higher concentrations of chlorine-36 were detected, however, in some of the samples collected at five locations, all of which are associated with observable faults or discrete fractures in the rock.  These concentrations are sufficiently above background to indicate that a small amount of water containing chlorine-36 generated by atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons has traveled from the surface in less than 50 years.  Chlorine-36 levels above background appear to represent more rapid flow of water along preferential pathways.  Additional samples are being collected and analyzed for chlorine-36 and other isotopes, to confirm the results and to provide information on new areas of the exploratory tunnel, including the Ghost Dance fault and the fracture zone.  Additional modeling studies will be performed to evaluate the chlorine-36 data as they relate to our understanding of hydrologic processes at Yucca Mountain and our conclusions about repository performance.<P>
<P>
In January, I noted that we were making progress refining our waste containment and isolation strategy for the Yucca Mountain site, and that we were within a few months of providing a draft to the Commission.  Although a condensed version of our updated strategy was included in the revised Program Plan, we have not yet completed the strategy.  A consensus view among Project participants could not be achieved without a fundamental re-evaluation of the need for some specific lines of scientific and engineering work.  This, in turn, led us to re-evaluate the fundamental assumptions supporting the core of the strategy.  The dialogue has been intense, and has led to iterations in defining the strategy and planning the related work.  The continuing effort to complete the strategy is, of course, serving its primary purpose by requiring the integration of the work being done and facilitating agreement on the remaining work proposed by Project participants.  An expanded version of the strategy was made available at the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board meeting on July 9 and a copy transmitted to your staff on July 19.  I expect that a detailed version of the strategy, including the definition of longer term information needs and work yet to be done that is explicitly linked to our long-range planning, will be completed in fiscal year 1997.<P>
<P>
In March, we published a report on the current level of detail for the repository and waste package advanced conceptual design.  This report gives us a new reference design based on the work performed to date.  The report depicts the major repository and waste package configurations, components, and operational concepts.  It also identifies those areas of the design requiring further refinement.  This design will serve as the benchmark for development of the design that will support the viability assessment in 1998.<P>


<H3>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation</H3>


In January, I informed you of our decision not to proceed with the certification of the multi-purpose canister system for storage and transportation of commercial spent nuclear fuel.  The Administration's fiscal year 1997 budget request does not include funding for this system and we do not intend to pursue its development beyond the completion of current activities.  The final design and draft safety analysis reports were completed by Westinghouse and delivered in August.  We accepted the final reports and the work has been completed for Phase 1 of the contract.  The results will be made available to other parties that may wish to pursue certification at their own expense.  We believe that such certifications would be in the public interest and would enhance the range of options in the marketplace.  The introduction of additional technology options would increase competition and provide a greater return on the public investment already made.<P>
<P>
The Department recognizes that the multi-purpose canister technology may be useful in the management of the Department's own spent fuel.  The Department's Office of Environmental Management has provided Westinghouse with $1 million in fiscal year 1996 to update the large transportation cask design so it is consistent with the most recent multi-purpose canister specification.  These modifications will provide an option for placing Department-owned fuel in interim storage in a form that is technically compatible with the current expectations for disposal.


<H2>Revised Program Approach</H2>


In December 1994, we published the <A HREF="http://www.rw.doe.gov/pages/intro/planltr.htm"><CITE>Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan</CITE></A>.  That plan outlined our approach to accomplishing the Program's principal objectives with reasonable target dates and at substantially reduced cost compared with earlier estimates.  I discussed this approach with the Commission in December 1994 and June 1995.  As noted in my comments before this Commission in January 1996, the decisions made in the fiscal year 1996 budget process made it impossible to continue that approach. <P>
<P>
In response to the fiscal year 1996 appropriation and the Congressional direction to concentrate on the major unresolved technical questions regarding geologic disposal at Yucca Mountain, we released a revision to the <CITE> Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan</CITE> on June 12, 1996.  Our revised Plan is supported by the President's fiscal year 1997 budget, which requested $400 million for the Program in 1997, $339 million of which would be allocated to the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project.  Congressional appropriations action for 1997 is not yet complete.  The House has approved a bill that, with certain contingencies, would provide $382 million for the Program.  The Senate has passed an appropriation bill that provides the full $400 million requested.<P>
<P>
We are still without agreement between the Administration and Congress on a new policy for the near-term management of spent nuclear fuel.  Congress continues to consider legislation that would initiate an interim storage program.  Just before it recessed, the Senate passed a bill that calls for construction of an interim storage facility near Yucca Mountain after the 1998 repository viability assessment and with additional provisions if the President decides the site is not viable.  The Administration has restated its opposition to this bill and to the House Commerce Committee bill, reported last October, that calls for the immediate construction of an interim storage facility near Yucca Mountain.  The outcome for the pending legislation by the end of this Congressional session is uncertain.<P>
<P>
Various utilities and a group of states and public utility commissions sought a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that the Department is obligated under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to begin disposing of the utilities' spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998.  In a decision issued in July, the Court agreed with the utilities, holding that the Act creates an obligation in the Department, reciprocal to the utilities' obligation to pay fees, to start disposing of spent nuclear fuel no later than January 31, 1998.  The Court rejected the Department's position that it does not have an obligation in the absence of a repository or other facility constructed under the Act.  The Court remanded the case to the Department for further proceedings, stating that it would be premature for a court to attempt to fashion an appropriate remedy, since the Department is not currently in default on the obligation.  The Department is reviewing the Court's ruling to determine what steps it should now take.<P>


<H3>Geologic Disposal</H3>


Our revised Program Plan describes a focused program that regains a target for a license application for a repository at Yucca Mountain, if the site is suitable.  The revised program is based on an increased technical understanding of the repository from more than a decade of scientific and engineering work at Yucca Mountain.  Our site investigations and total system performance assessments have allowed us to reach much better informed judgements regarding the specific aspects of the site that are significant to performance.  These judgments have enabled us to reduce the work required to support regulatory decisions and thereby accommodate a substantial reduction in future funding with minimal slippage in schedule.<P>
<P>
The 1988 Site Characterization Plan for Yucca Mountain established the initial basis for our characterization of the site.  Given the information then available on site conditions, the formative nature of the repository and waste package design concepts and the developmental status of our performance assessment capabilities, our initial approach to planning a site characterization program was to make it sufficiently comprehensive to minimize the potential for gaps in the information ultimately found to be necessary.  As expected, our plans have evolved significantly since 1988 based on what we have learned from our scientific studies and design work.  Beginning in February 1990, we have provided information on the nature and results of our site characterization activities in our semiannual progress reports.<P>
<P>
Because of our enhanced understanding of site conditions, we have continued to refine our strategy for evaluating the site's ability to contain and isolate waste.  Our understanding has made it possible for us to refine the remaining work scope needed to support our viability assessment, as well as our subsequent evaluation of site suitability, and preparation of a license application for submittal to the Commission.  By 1998, we will have assembled and analyzed the wealth of scientific data that is available and updated our assessment of the performance of a repository at Yucca Mountain.  We will also have developed a repository design and assessed the technical and economic feasibility of constructing the repository.  If the repository appears to be viable based on our assessment of this information, we will complete the work necessary to determine the site's suitability and, if suitable, to make a formal recommendation of the site to the President in 2001 and submit a license application to the Commission by 2002.<P>
<P>
The revised Program Plan describes the overall approach for the technical and regulatory changes that will bring the program into alignment with the direction received from the Administration and Congress, and with our current knowledge about the site and repository design.  This plan defines three objectives that will maintain the momentum toward a national decision on the geologic disposal option:<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Update the regulatory framework in 1997 for evaluating the suitability of Yucca Mountain;
<LI>Complete the viability assessment in 1998;
<LI>Recommend the repository site to the President in 2001 if the site is suitable, and submit a license application to the Commission in 2002. 
</UL>


<H4>Update the regulatory framework for evaluating the suitability of Yucca Mountain</H4>


The regulatory framework developed after enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in 1982 was heavily influenced by the initial requirement of the Act to screen a number of candidate repository sites and select the most promising sites for further action.  The 1987 amendment to the Act directed us to evaluate only a single specific site.  The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a site-specific radiation protection standard for a repository at Yucca Mountain.  This requirement signals a broad change to the regulatory framework for repository development, shifting it from a generic to a site-specific basis for evaluation and decision-making.  The Energy Policy Act also directs the Commission to revise its licensing requirements to be consistent with the site-specific standard.<P>
<P>
To respond to the policy changes, and supported by our increased understanding of the Yucca Mountain site, we have decided to revise our siting guidelines (10 CFR Part 960).  The guidelines will be revised through a public rulemaking process initiated by a notice of proposed rulemaking later this year.  Our goal is to publish the final rule in 1997.  As was done during the 1984 promulgation of the siting guidelines, we will obtain the Commission's concurrence with the revised guidelines, and we will work with your staff to facilitate this action.<P>
<P>
Site "characterization" and site "suitability" initially focused on a set of hypothesized characteristics that were considered to be indications of greater or lesser probability that any site could successfully host a repository. These characteristics were selected based upon very preliminary comprehension of the technical factors affecting repository performance.  Their selection was also influenced by the need to address generic conditions even though any particular characteristic might have very different significance when applied to sites in diverse geologic settings.<P>
<P>
In the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments of 1987, the program was directed to evaluate only the Yucca Mountain site.  As a result, the comparative nature of the site characterization process lost its logical basis.  Some of the generic characteristics specified for evaluation proved to be of limited utility in terms of evaluating performance in the unique geologic setting of the Yucca Mountain site, and in terms of the evolving waste isolation strategy for a specific engineered facility in that geologic setting. The appropriate measure of the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site, therefore, is the total system performance of a proposed repository design that can be implemented in that site-specific geologic setting compared to the applicable regulatory standards for public health and safety and environmental protection.  That measure will capture the relevant attributes of the site.  The revised siting guidelines will rely upon the radiation protection standard for Yucca Mountain as the ultimate criterion of site suitability for the evaluation of postclosure system performance.<P>
<P>
We have been interested in your staff's recent discussions with the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste and with this Commission on their preliminary consideration of significant and possible site-specific changes to the Commission's licensing requirements.  We are particularly interested in and support the consideration of changes that would result in a simple, risk-based rule, with a single quantitative criterion for postclosure performance.  Any rule change should also recognize that site conditions cannot be evaluated in isolation from the assessment of performance and that probabilistic arguments will need to be used in demonstrating compliance with the Commission's technical criteria.  We discussed our general views on changes in the licensing requirements with your staff at our management meeting in July.  We plan to continue our interactions with the staff during their preliminary consideration of the available options.


<H4>Complete the viability assessment in 1998</H4>


The near-term activities in our program plan for the Yucca Mountain project are focused on addressing the major unresolved technical questions associated with the overall performance of a repository so that, by 1998, we can make an informed assessment of the viability of licensing and constructing a repository.  The work supporting the viability assessment will include four components:  (1) a package of more specific design work on the critical elements of the repository concept and the waste package;  (2) a total system performance assessment, based upon that design concept and upon the scientific data and analysis that will be available to us by 1998, which will describe the probable behavior of the repository in the Yucca Mountain geologic setting;  (3) an upgraded estimate of the costs to construct and operate the repository in accordance with the design;  and (4) a plan and cost estimate for the remaining work required to complete a license application.<P>
<P>
The first component addresses design elements that are critical to determining the feasibility and performance of the repository and the engineered barrier system.  We will evaluate the technological feasibility of the designs, but we will not yet have the detail needed for licensing.  The designs will build on the Advanced Conceptual Design Report that we published in March.  The emphasis will be on the aspects of the design that affect waste containment and isolation, and that are major considerations for repository cost.  These aspects include management of the waste-generated heat and its effects, corrosion of waste packages, and the need for and feasibility of supplemental engineered barriers.  The effort will address concepts for waste-retrieval operations, performance-confirmation requirements, safety systems, and other factors that significantly affect repository cost.<P>
<P>
The second component is an updated total system performance assessment based on our design concept and the analyses of the available site and engineering data.  The primary objective of this assessment is to evaluate the probable performance of the repository.  An additional objective is to further refine our evaluation of repository performance under a range of both normal conditions and conditions likely to be imposed by potentially disruptive events.  Sensitivity analyses will be performed to refine our strategy for the evaluation of waste containment and isolation.  We will also identify areas where significant uncertainties exist and, where possible, the means to reduce these uncertainties for the license application or as part of a performance confirmation program.  A phased peer review of our performance assessment results will be initiated later this year.  Detailed planning for this review has already begun and work will start in October.  The comments and recommendations available from the early stages of the peer review will be incorporated, as appropriate, in the total system performance assessment as it is developed for the viability assessment.  The comments and recommendations from later review cycles will be incorporated into the assessment that supports the site recommendation and preparation of the license application.<P>
<P>
The third component is the cost estimate for the repository system, which will cover activities through repository closure and decommissioning.  The life-cycle cost estimate will provide information for policy decisions regarding the feasibility of continuing with licensing and construction of a geologic repository.<P>
<P>
The fourth component is the license application plan, which will define the actions required and the scientific and engineering information that may be needed to complete a license application for submittal to the Commission.  The preparation of the license application plan will also provide an opportunity to assess the adequacy of our revised approach to site characterization and design, and the effectiveness of updates to the regulatory framework.<P>
<P>
The completion of these components constitutes a logical convergence point at which the program can make a measurably improved appraisal of the prospects for geologic disposal at the Yucca Mountain site.  The Administration has stated its position that this appraisal should be available to inform any decision concerning the site for a Federal interim storage facility for commercial spent nuclear fuel.  Pending legislation also recognizes the assessment as a significant benchmark in the program.



<H4>Recommend the site to the President in 2001, if the site is suitable, and submit a license application to the Commission in 2002</H4>



The goal of submitting a successful license application to the Commission remains central to the Program's mission.  The work completed for the viability assessment will be an integral step on the path to a license application.  That body of work, augmented in later years, will serve as the foundation for our evaluation of site suitability, an environmental impact statement, a Secretarial site recommendation to the President, and a license application to the Commission. <P>
<P>
An environmental impact statement must accompany the Secretary's site recommendation to the President and the license application to the Commission.  We published a Notice of Intent in the Federal Register in August 1995, initiating the public comment period on the proposed scope of the repository environmental impact statement.  The public comment period closed in December 1995 and, as I noted in January, further action was deferred because of the reduced funding for fiscal year 1996.  Our revised Program Plan now calls for resuming work on the environmental impact statement in fiscal year 1997, with publication of the draft statement in 1999 and the final statement in 2000.<P>
<P>
If the site is determined to be suitable, a decision by the Secretary to recommend the site is expected in 2001.  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires that the Secretary's recommendation consider the Commission's preliminary comments on the sufficiency of our at-depth site characterization analysis and waste form proposal for inclusion in a license application.<P>
<P>
Under our revised Program Plan, a Project Integrated Safety Assessment will be prepared to integrate the technical elements of the program.  This document will describe and integrate information on site conditions, repository and waste package design, and performance assessment.  The document will be provided to the Commission in 1999 for review as one basis for its preliminary comments on the sufficiency of information on the site and design for inclusion in a repository license application.  The Project Integrated Safety Assessment will be used as the starting point for development of our license application.<P>
<P>
Although we were unable to proceed with work on the licensing support system in fiscal year 1996, our revised Program Plan includes a budget and schedule for system development, with work beginning again in fiscal year 1997.  The licensing support system is intended to meet the Commission's requirements for access to the comprehensive documentation required for the licensing proceedings before submittal of an application.  We understand that the Commission is reviewing the current requirements for the licensing support system and may be contemplating changes to these requirements.  Changes that will allow use of the significant advances in computer technology and connectivity (such as the World-Wide-Web) that have occurred since these requirements were last revised in 1991 would be welcome.<P>
<P>
Certification of the licensing support system by the Commission's system administrator is required at least six months before a license application is submitted.  Our current plans will allow us to have a computer-based licensing support system in place that meets the Commission's current requirements and available for certification by November 1999.  Although our schedule is aggressive, we understand that the requirements may change and will continue to interact with your staff as it explores new approaches to system development.  I commend the Commission for taking a leadership role in defining and implementing positive solutions to the problem of document availability, and urge you to continue your involvement in the process for development of the licensing support system.


<H4>Revised Program Approach to Licensing </H4>


Over the past seven months, both of our organizations have been reacting to the changes directed in the high-level waste program.  During this period, and in spite of the funding constraints on the scope of our activities, I believe that our staff interactions have become better focused and more useful.  I hope that we can continue to build on this progress as we implement our revised program approach.<P>
<P>
 The products associated with the viability assessment will facilitate a measurably improved understanding of the repository concept and a comprehensive appraisal of the prospects for licensing and constructing a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain.  Although the information collected will not yet be sufficient for licensing, the work leading to the viability assessment provides a logical approach to developing a first-of-a-kind repository.  In completing the work products associated with this assessment, we will define a repository concept that includes a facility and waste package design consistent with the characteristics of the Yucca Mountain site, and an assessment of the performance of this repository.  We will examine alternatives and propose the best repository system that can be achieved within rational cost and schedule constraints.  It is appropriate for us to complete the technical work, develop a concept, and satisfy ourselves of its ability to adequately protect public health and safety before we seek approval from outside parties. <P>
<P>
From our perspective, our interactions with your staff should focus on two objectives.  First, we hope to reach a common understanding regarding the issues that are significant to the overall performance of a repository at Yucca Mountain.  Second, we hope to reach agreement on the adequacy of the methodologies we are using and the approaches we are taking to address important technical issues such as criticality control and seismic design.  The goal is to reach a mutual understanding of the developing repository concept that will provide a basis for the Commission's preliminary comments on the sufficiency of our site characterization analysis and design for inclusion in a license application.<P>
<P>
This approach is a departure from previous efforts that focused on resolving individual issues related to specific site characteristics in isolation from one another or from a specific design concept.  In my view, the lack of a conceptual frame of reference for discussion has been a source of discomfort in previous interactions with the Commission.  The sufficiency of site characterization data and analyses generally can only be determined within the context of a coherent repository concept that includes both a design and an assessment of its performance.  Therefore, we will concentrate first on developing the overall concept for the repository system, and on communicating our progress to your staff, rather than on reaching agreement regarding the sufficiency of our data and analyses to address isolated issues related to specific site characteristics in advance of such a concept.  The staff's insights regarding these issues, however, would help ensure that there will be sufficient information in a subsequent license application.  We expect that the staff will inform us of issues that are not being considered or that are not receiving appropriate emphasis from a licensing perspective as they review the results of our system performance analyses.<P>
<P>
We will discuss our approaches and methodologies for dealing with specific technical issues.  We expect the staff's feedback on the adequacy of our proposed approaches and methods for use in a licensing proceeding.  We plan to continue development of a limited number of topical reports, with the goal of receiving staff safety evaluation reports that can be referenced in a license application as an appropriate means for resolving selected issues.


<H3>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation</H3>


In the portions of our revised program approach outside of the Yucca Mountain Project, we will continue working toward staff acceptance of our actinide-only burnup credit topical report.  In response to your staff's comments, we are performing additional analyses using existing data from the nuclear industry, including foreign burnup credit experience.  Our responses to the staff's questions on the topical report will be completed later this calendar year.  We will also continue our work on the development and demonstration of the capability for dry transfer of spent fuel.  We will complete a topical safety analysis report for a stand-alone dry transfer system that could be used at both utility and federal sites, and submit it to your staff later this year for review and acceptance.<P>
<P>
Any future scenario of interim storage, or ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel, will require a national transportation effort.  Over the past seven months, we have developed a revised strategy that will enable us to acquire the capability to accept, store, and transport spent nuclear fuel as rapidly and efficiently as possible when a federal storage or disposal facility is available.  The strategy is in accordance with the Administration's objectives for re-engineering government and greater privatization of Federal activities.<P>
<P>
In the near-term, we will be concentrating upon two major activities:<P>
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Develop a market-driven waste acceptance, storage, and transportation approach that relies on the private sector for implementation.
<LI>Conduct non-site-specific design and engineering analyses for an interim storage facility to reduce facility licensing time, if such a facility is authorized.
</UL>

<P>
In May, we published a request in the Federal Register and the Commerce Business Daily for expressions of interest and comments on our plans to develop a market-driven transportation capability.  In July, we met with the interested parties to discuss these plans and to receive comments to assist in shaping the concept.  Under the approach discussed, we would contract with private industry to provide equipment and services for delivering spent fuel to an interim storage facility or repository.<P>
<P>
We are also currently developing a topical safety analysis report for the first phase of an interim storage facility based on a non-site-specific design for receipt and storage of spent fuel in transportable storage casks or canisters.  We will submit this topical report in fiscal year 1997.  We believe that the staff's acceptance of the topical safety analysis report for the initial phase of facility operations will reduce the time required for subsequent preparation of a license application and staff review of a site-specific design and related safety considerations.<P>
<P>
The second stage of the strategy involves work that should be accomplished after a site is designated.  Implementation of this stage is contingent upon Presidential and Congressional agreement on the necessary authority and funding.  Our Program Plan assumes that agreement would be reached in 1999, consistent with the Administration's position that a siting decision should be based on objective criteria and informed by an appraisal of the viability of the Yucca Mountain repository.


<H2>Conclusion</H2>


In our revised Program Plan, we have begun to accommodate the significant changes that are needed to focus the activities and maintain the momentum of the repository program.  If there is an aspect of the site that contradicts our expectations about the performance of a repository at Yucca Mountain, we are likely to discover it by 1998 through the work performed for the viability assessment.  If there are shortcomings in the available technologies or in our ability to implement the repository design concepts, they will be evident by then.  With adequate funding and an updated regulatory process for the evaluation of site suitability and repository licensing, I am confident that, if the site is suitable, we can achieve our target date of 2002 for the submittal of a license application to the Commission.  We have also developed plans and initiated activities that should enable us to respond efficiently and effectively to new authority on interim storage, once a conclusion is reached on the viability of the repository undertaking.<P>
<P>
Thank you for the opportunity to brief the Commission.  I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.<P>

							Daniel A. Dreyfus, Director
		Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management U.S. Department of Energy
									Before the 
	    Seventh Annual International High-Level Radioactive Waste Management Conference
								Las Vegas, Nevada 
								     April 29, 1996</pre></h4>
<hr>

<body><strong>Working Toward A Conclusion</strong>

<p>
Good Morning.  I appreciate having another opportunity to share my view of the U.S. radioactive waste management program with this audience.  This conference represents an unusual forum.  It is the largest regular gathering of people who are technically knowledgeable about the challenge of demonstrating the viability of geologic disposal of high-level radioactive waste.
<p>
As I stated last year, to accomplish that objective, we will continually have to articulate the rationale and progress of the scientific program to constituencies that are more concerned with societal values, economic and financial considerations, and sometimes narrow parochial interests and partisan political motives.  We have no inherent right to invest public resources in the geologic disposal option.  We have to justify our purpose and our investment to the public whenever and wherever it is questioned, and in terms that can be understood.
<p>
For the U.S. program, this past year has been a critical period of questioning, examination, and revision.
<p>
<strong>Program Funding and Progress</strong>
<p>
In 1994, we proposed a program approach and funding profile that would permit us to meet the policy goals set by Congress in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  That approach was funded by the Congress and pursued with the Fiscal Year 1995 appropriation.
<p>
I am happy to report that we have made significant progress since last year.  We allocated almost the entire increase in funding that was appropriated for Fiscal Year 1995 to the Yucca Mountain Project.  We completed the year with most of our goals met and accomplishments that often exceeded our targets.
<p>
At Yucca Mountain, we have completed more than one-half of the planned five mile exploratory tunnel, and are now well ahead of schedule.  The tunnel is into the repository horizon, and provides scientists with direct access to the sites geology.  The data collected in the tunnel, along with a decade of scientific work at the site will provide us with a sound evaluation of the important hypotheses that we will rely upon for the design of a repository and the assurance of its safety.
<p>
I am pleased to note that the independent Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, which follows the technical progress of the program in detail, acknowledged our progress at Yucca Mountain in a letter to Secretary OLeary.  The Board stated that our emerging waste isolation strategy and our recent advances in repository performance assessment will enable us to achieve a better understanding of the proposed repository site "in less time and at less cost."
<p>
Last Fall, however, in a climate of deficit reduction and in the midst of a policy debate over the issues of interim storage, Congress did not fund the continuation of our previous program approach.  A reduced total appropriation to the program along with a reservation of part of the funds for future work on interim storage presented us with a 40 percent reduction in funding for the fiscal year we are now managing.  
<p>
Congress recognized that the reduction would require a more constrained repository program and provided guidance in that regard.  In response to Congressional direction and the Presidents policy direction, we are preparing a new, more concentrated program plan that can regain a target for a license application within a reasonable time, but which requires only moderately increased funding in future years.  
<p>
As part of that plan, we have refocused our efforts at Yucca Mountain on the most significant remaining issues.  We have defined a set of tasks that will complete the unique portions of the repository design; evaluate its potential performance in the geologic setting; and provide a more precise estimate of the cost to construct a repository.  We will complete these tasks by 1998.
<p>
This package of products will not represent a formal decision on the suitability of the site.  Rather, it is an effort to converge the work already done upon the most important remaining questions concerning the viability of a repository proposal.  These questions include not only the key scientific and engineering judgements, but also the cost and capability issues that can determine the ultimate feasibility of going forward with a repository proposal.
<p>
We have had to defer many licensing activities in 1996, and the Congress recognized that we would do so.  Submitting a successful license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, however, remains central to our mission under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and to the Presidents policy on high-level waste management.  If the Yucca Mountain site proves to be suitable, we believe we can file and an application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002 for a permit to construct the repository.  That target will depend in part upon our success in updating the regulatory framework.  Based on the extensive understanding we have developed over the years of site investigation, and recognizing the policy changes that have occurred over the past 10 years, we intend to propose revisions to the Departments siting guidelines (10 CFR Part 960) to create a more efficient process for evaluating the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site.  We expect to realize substantial efficiencies in the remaining work by focusing our process and our science and engineering upon the particular, site-specific safety case that must be made.
<p>
This work will be going forward along with the development of a site-specific radiological protection standard for Yucca Mountain by the Environmental Protection Agency and conformance of the licensing regulations to this new standard by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  We will continue to consult with the Commission and other stakeholders as the regulatory framework for the geologic repository is updated.
<p>
Our Fiscal Year 1996 funding situation required us to terminate our canister and cask development work.  The work completed should prove useful to the private sector, and we will rely upon the marketplace to provide the needed technologies.  We have also reduced the cost of programwide management and administration significantly.  We have had to reduce the funding of our cooperative agreements with program stakeholders.  In future years, we will apply a much greater proportion of overall funding to the specific deliverables of the programs business centers.  Those are the decision about disposal at the Yucca Mountain site, the development of a capability to accept and transport spent fuel and high-level waste, and if the policy issues are resolved, the efficient and effective provision of Federal interim storage.
<p>
<strong>Program Outlook</strong>
<p>
The Administration's budget request for Fiscal Year 1997 now pending before the Congress supports this approach.  The revision to our December 1994 Program Plan, which I expect to complete in a few weeks, outlines the work scope for the program.  The necessity to respond quickly to the unanticipated Fiscal Year 1996 fund reduction and to develop concurrently an Administration proposal for the Fiscal Year 1997 budget foreclosed the opportunity for an extensive consultative process during the preparation of the plan.  The new plan, however, flows smoothly from our previous planning efforts.  Its essential elements will be familiar to those who have closely followed our strategic planning process and the implementation of the program over the past two years.  The major policy directions have evolved out of the Congressional appropriations process in which many of our stakeholders have actively participated. 
<p>
Of the total request of $400 million for Fiscal Year 1997, 85 percent ($339 million) would go to the Yucca Mountain Project.  During the fiscal year, we will complete the five-mile exploratory tunnel and the construction of all major underground test alcoves.  We will initiate heater tests in the repository rock to simulate the effects of heat generated by radioactive waste packages and to study the structural and hydrologic response.  We will penetrate the Ghost Dance Fault, a major geologic feature of the mountain, first by drilling and then by tunneling.  I expect the results of this work to provide a great deal of enlightenment about the movement of water in the mountain.  We will also advance the detailed design of those engineered features of the repository concept that are critical to an evaluation of its technical, economic, and overall feasibility.
The $10 million we are requesting for our waste acceptance, storage, and transportation activities will support our legal oversight responsibilities concerning commercial spent fuel.  We will also continue planning for the transportation and interim storage of spent fuel.  We will examine a market-based approach to acquire that transportation capability.  Procurements would be used to obtain the needed shipping services from private vendors.  They would arrange to collect spent fuel from power plant sites and deliver it to a Federal storage or disposal facility.
<p>
We also intend to engage the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in pre-licensing discussions on a non-site-specific basis that concern the technical and procedural aspects of licensing a phased interim storage facility.
<p>
The $51 million request for program management is 12.6 percent of the total program budget, down from 16.3 percent in Fiscal Year 1996, and from 25 percent in Fiscal Year 1993.  This amount covers all of our Federal salaries and related work expenses; the nuclear quality assurance efforts required by our regulators; and overall program planning, integration, human resources, and general business administration activities.
<p>
<strong>Concluding Remarks</strong>
<p>
I believe that the planning we have done and the momentum we gained in Fiscal Year 1995 have enabled us to make progress, despite the severely constrained funding we received in Fiscal Year 1996.
<p>
A great deal remains to be done, but we are narrowing the range of unresolved scientific and engineering issues.  We intend to address the most important unfinished issues as early as possible.
<p>
The direction we are taking will, by 1998, provide us with a good evaluation of the prospects for a successful repository proposal at the Yucca Mountain site.  With adequate funding and an updated regulatory process  we can regain a target date, of 2002, for the submittal of a competent license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<p>
Thank you.

<p>
<b>Introduction </b>
<p>
Chairman Jackson and Commissioner Rogers:
<p>
A lot has happened since I last spoke with you in June of last year regarding the Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management Program.  We are now four months into the new fiscal year,
operating under a reduced budget that required us to restructure our geologic disposal program
and to terminate a large portion of our waste acceptance activities.  We are, as yet, without
agreement between the Administration and Congress on new policy direction on our role in the
near-term management of spent nuclear fuel.  Congress is continuing to consider legislation to
initiate construction of an interim storage facility.  If such legislation is enacted, we will need to
further redirect our program.
<p>
To the best of my ability at this point, I will share with you our planning for the future of
the program, considering the funding and the direction the Congress has provided through the
appropriations bill enacted for the current fiscal year.  I will also discuss our contingency
planning in the event that the Administration and Congress agree on new policy direction for
interim storage.
<p>
<u>Fiscal Year 1995 Accomplishments</u>
<p>
In my briefing to you in December 1994, I outlined our targets for implementing the
program approach, which was described in the Program Plan we issued that same month.  At that
time, I noted the importance of gaining agreement by Congress to the 40 per cent increase in
funding requested by the Administration for fiscal year 1995.  The program approach was
endorsed by Congress as a basis for 1995 funding.  It also was generally supported by the
Commission and other program stakeholders.
<p>
Almost all of the increase in funding for fiscal year 1995 was allocated to, and utilized by
the Yucca Mountain Project, which completed the fiscal year with very little carry over and with
accomplishments that often exceeded our targets.  For example, we overcame startup difficulties
in tunneling and made important progress constructing the exploratory studies facility.  Since
December 1994, the tunnel boring machine has excavated over 3,800 meters (over 12,000 feet)
into Yucca Mountain, well ahead of schedule.  The machine is currently operating within the
proposed repository formation.  It has passed the location where the thermal testing alcove will
be constructed and will soon reach the location of the first planned alcove to access the Ghost
Dance Fault.  Progress has permitted our scientists and engineers to begin direct observation and
testing of subsurface geologic and hydrologic conditions, and studies of the engineering
properties of the rock and its response to construction activities.  This information has enhanced,
and to a significant degree confirmed, our understanding of site conditions.  We made similar
progress in other scientific activities and we also initiated the process for development of the
repository environmental impact statement, publishing a Notice of Intent in August and
completing the comment period in December 1995.
<p>
The Office of Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation also made considerable
progress over the past year toward the goals established in the Program Plan.  The scoping
process for the environmental impact statement for a multi-purpose canister system was
completed in January 1995 and the Implementation Plan was issued in August.  The contract for
design and certification of the multi-purpose canister system was issued to Westinghouse
Government and Environmental Services Company in April 1995.  The contract includes three
phases, of which the first - system design and preparation of safety analysis reports - is scheduled
for completion by April.
<p>
<u>Fiscal Year 1996 Funding Situation</u>
<p>
Unfortunately, the decisions made by the Congress in the fiscal year 1996 appropriations
process have made it impossible for us to continue with the program approach.  The Energy and
Water appropriation bill that was enacted provided only $400 million for the program and,
furthermore, froze $85 million of that amount pending the possible future enactment of interim
storage authority.  The result is a program funding level of $315 million, only half of the $630
million we requested for fiscal year 1996 to implement our Program Plan, and 40 per cent below
our fiscal year 1995 level of effort.  The program approach is no longer sustainable at this
funding level and we are adjusting the program to meet our legal responsibilities.
<p>
We have proceeded to reduce our expenditure level to the degree necessary to conform to
the fiscal year 1996 budget of $315 million.  Based on the expectation of a $400 million budget,
we took action in September 1995 to eliminate about 875 contractor jobs over this fiscal year,
primarily within the Yucca Mountain project.  In November, we further reduced the program to
reflect the unexpected loss of another $85 million.  This resulted in the elimination of over 200
additional contractor jobs.  These latest reductions primarily affected the work of our Office of
Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation, and our Program Management functions.  As we
took these actions we tried, within our existing authorities, to preserve vital program activities.
<p>
<u>New Program Outlook</u>
<p>
In the early stages of the recent policy debate, the Congress seriously considered
terminating the geologic disposal program.  As the debate evolved, however, political and
practical considerations about the consequences of abandoning geologic disposal gave way to a
more rational and prudent approach.  The Commission's testimony supporting continued
progress toward development of a geologic repository undoubtedly helped.  Congress has
continued to fund the disposal program, but at a much lower level than the President's budget
request for fiscal year 1996.
<p>
The Congress recognized that, because of the significant reduction in funding, a much
reduced repository program would be required.  The Conference Report directed that the reduced
scope should focus on the core scientific activities at Yucca Mountain and that preparation and
submittal of a license application to the Commission should be deferred.  As a result, the target
dates in our program approach for the construction of a geologic repository and for emplacing
waste underground also have been deferred.  What new targets are possible and practicable will
depend upon the expectations for future funding of the program.
<p>
As directed by Congress, we have refocused the repository program on addressing the
major unresolved technical questions regarding the conceptual design of the repository and its
expected performance in the geologic setting.  Consistent with this guidance, we have defined a
new milestone for the Yucca Mountain Project in the form of a specific set of deliverables that
contribute to a "viability assessment."  This work will resolve the critical current uncertainties
and provide the requisite information for a determination in 1998 of the viability of continuing
with actions leading to the licensing of a geologic repository at the Yucca Mountain site.
<p>
With appropriate policy and reasonable funding support, we can regain a license
application target, but at a later date than anticipated.  We will continue to implement our quality
assurance program in a manner that is consistent with available resources, however, further
submittals of revisions to the repository license application annotated outline and work on the
licensing support system can not be sustained.  Expectations regarding various forms of
interaction and information exchange between our staffs are not likely to be met in the reduced
funding situation.
<p>
National policy for the near-term management of spent nuclear fuel is also being
considered in the Congress, but there has been no resolution of the issue as yet.  With severely
limited funds, and in the absence of agreement between the Administration and Congress on new
policy direction, we are trying to maintain our ability to respond to this new direction, to the
extent that our limited resources permit.
<p>
The drastic curtailment in funding for fiscal year 1996 has made it necessary for us to
terminate most of our waste acceptance, canister development, and generic transportation work. 
We will not proceed with certification of the multi-purpose canister system once the safety
analysis report design phase is completed.  All related activities, including our involvement in the
preparation of the environmental impact statement, will also be terminated.  Continued work on
development and certification of legal-weight truck casks for transportation of spent fuel can not
be supported.  We also can not sustain our dialog with interested parties on transportation issues
at the same level as last year.  Our cooperative agreements will be funded at substantially reduced
levels.
<p>
We will continue to pursue our interactions with your staff on burnup credit.  We will
also undertake contingency planning to maintain our ability to respond aggressively should we
get agreement between the Administration and Congress on new policy direction regarding
interim storage. 
<p>
<b>Disposal</b>
<p>
The Administration remains committed to geologic disposal.  The issue that confronted
us in our planning for this fiscal year was whether the program can sustain meaningful progress
toward a future decision on geologic disposal with a funding profile that is significantly below
that required for the program approach described in the Program Plan.  The target dates that we
had aspired to in our program approach for the submittal of a license application to construct a
geologic repository and for emplacing waste underground had to be deferred, of course, as the
Congress acknowledged.  What new targets are possible and practicable will depend upon the
policy and regulatory framework within which the program must operate and expectations for
future funding, up to and beyond 1998.  In planning this program, I am reluctant to assume that
we will receive future funding levels that are inconsistent with the current outlook.  Such
optimistic assumptions of large future increases in annual funding have been a major factor in
discrediting the program in past years.
<p>
Although the focus of our activities has changed, we must not jeopardize our ability
eventually to go forward with licensing.  We will maintain our programs for quality assurance
and technical data management at appropriate levels, consistent with available resources.  I
believe that the Department and the Commission must both rethink their roles, and work together
to define the purpose and nature of their interactions in this changing environment.
<p>
<u>Viability Assessment</u>
<p>
Given the funding for fiscal year 1996 and the likely scenario for the foreseeable future,
the only practical approach is to concentrate the repository effort on the major unresolved
technical questions that must be answered to complete the conceptual design of the repository
and to describe its expected performance in the geologic setting.  Indeed, this is the instruction
given to us in the Conference Report accompanying the Appropriations Act.  In order to manage
the program, as well as to explain and justify the continuing activity to its stakeholders, we have
defined a specific set of deliverables, consistent with the Congressional guidance we received. 
These deliverables will include the following:
<p>
     <li>a package of more specific design work on the critical elements of the repository and the
     waste package, including a concept of operations that identifies available technologies to
     accomplish the objectives of geologic disposal;
<p>
     <li>a total system performance assessment, based upon this design concept and the data
     available to us, which will describe the probable behavior of the repository;
<p>
     <li>a plan and cost estimate for the remaining work required to complete a license
     application; and
<p>
     <li>an estimate of the costs to construct and operate the repository.
<p>
These deliverables, when completed, will provide a better understanding of the
repository design and its performance in the geologic setting, a better appreciation of the
remaining work needed to prepare a license application, and a more precise estimate of the cost
of a repository.  The completion of these deliverables constitutes a logical convergence point at
which we can make a measurably improved judgement of the prospects for geologic disposal at
the Yucca Mountain site and present this information to the Administration and Congress.  We
have characterized this convergence point as a "viability assessment."
<p>
This viability assessment is not the same as the technical site suitability evaluation that
was a target in our program approach and that I have discussed with the Commission previously. 
Our technical site suitability evaluation was based on making a sequence of  higher-level findings
for the qualifying and disqualifying conditions of our siting guidelines, 10 CFR Part 960.  In
making these findings we would have followed the process for evaluating site suitability that we
finalized in December 1994.  The funding we can now expect will not support that process.  The
viability assessment is a management target and its technical components do not correspond to
the siting guidelines in 10 CFR Part 960.  The deliverables that contribute to this assessment are
intended to clarify the most uncertain aspects of geologic disposal at Yucca Mountain.  If the
judgment on the viability of geologic disposal at Yucca Mountain is positive, the components
that contributed to this judgment also will contribute to the requirements for a Secretarial
recommendation to the President, and, subsequently, to a license application to this Commission. 
The assessment will not be sufficient for, nor will it prejudice, these subsequent formal actions
by the Department.
<p>
In order to complete the deliverables we have defined, we must document our
understanding of site conditions, incorporating the data already collected and the new
information being gained from the exploratory studies facility.  We must also have sufficient
understanding of the critical factors affecting our waste containment and isolation strategy to
select the technologies to be used and to gain confidence that geologic disposal at Yucca
Mountain is technically feasible.  In addition, we will need to address cross-cutting design issues,
such as use of backfill, criticality control, and thermal loading. 
<p>
We anticipate completing the deliverables that contribute to the viability assessment by
1998, or sooner, if possible.  Completion of the deliverables by 1998 will be possible because we
can rely upon the large amount of information already collected on site conditions, the progress
already made on the advanced conceptual designs for the repository and waste package, and the
understanding gained from the latest in our series of iterative total-system performance
assessments.  This year, we are compiling the information we have collected to document our
current understanding of the site.  This information will support the additional design work
needed in certain critical areas and the next planned assessment of the expected performance of
our design concepts in the geologic setting.
<p>
We will develop a revised program plan over the next few months, consistent with the
fiscal year 1997 budget cycle.  We will describe our reconfigured program to the Commission as
our plans develop.
<p>
<u>Waste Containment and Isolation Strategy</u>
<p>
We have been refining and documenting our waste containment and isolation strategy for
the Yucca Mountain site over the past year.  When complete, it will reflect our acquired
knowledge of the site and its natural barriers, as well as the likely influence of site conditions on
the performance of potential engineered barriers.  The strategy focuses on two technical
objectives:  first, to limit the annual dose to members of the general public following permanent
closure of the repository; and second, to provide total containment of the waste within the
emplaced waste packages for thousands of years, during the period of highest radionuclide
inventory and temperature.
<p>
A general description of this strategy was included in our Program Plan in December
1994.  During the past year, as we refined the strategy, we provided status briefings to your staff,
the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste, and the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board.  In
these briefings, we discussed the elements of our strategy and the links to our testing program. 
Feedback from your staff on our strategy would be welcomed.
<p>
The essence of our strategy is the articulation of specific working hypotheses as testable
bases for assessing how a waste isolation system at Yucca Mountain will perform.  These
hypotheses were developed based on the information already collected.  The working hypotheses
relate to specific hydrologic attributes of the natural system, as well as to specific physical
characteristics of materials that may be part of the engineered system, and the important
interactions between the natural and engineered systems, so that we can design the engineered
enhancements that provide defense-in-depth.  Taken separately, the hypotheses provide the bases
for organizing, managing, and explaining the rationale for our work.  Taken together, the
hypotheses comprise a structure for the assessment of the waste isolation capability of a
repository at Yucca Mountain.
<p>
The strategy enables us to concentrate our efforts on a more limited testing program to
answer questions about a small number of specific hypotheses that may be crucial to the viability
assessment.  In the longer-term, we hope to use the strategy to help us define the critical work
that remains to be done to enable us to complete a license application.
<p>
<u>Repository and Waste Package Design</u>
<p>
The goal of the repository advanced conceptual design phase has been modified from that
which we had originally envisioned under our program approach.  Given the likely funding
profile and the need to provide design information to support the viability assessment, our plan
for fiscal year 1996 is to document the current conceptual level of detail for the repository design. 
This will provide us with a reference design, or a benchmark, based on the work performed to
date.  A summary report on the repository advanced conceptual design is being prepared by our
Management and Operations Contractor and will be submitted to the Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization Office in March.  This report will identify those areas of the design requiring
further refinement.   This report will also facilitate a review of the current design concept against
the design and safety requirements. 
<p>
In the next phase, selected aspects of the design will be advanced to resolve key issues
that will allow us to demonstrate that the construction, operation, and closure of the repository
are technically feasible.  The design information we compile over the next few years will be the
basis for our assessment of the expected performance of the system in terms of radiological
safety and waste isolation.  Outputs of this design phase will also support the evaluation of the
additional design work that may be needed to support our license application for construction of
a repository.  It will also support preparation of an updated cost estimate for construction and
operation of a repository.
<p>
<u>Thermal Loading </u>
<p>
We must have sufficient understanding of thermal loading issues to define our concepts
for the repository and waste package, to evaluate the performance and environmental
consequences of these concepts in the geologic setting, and to estimate the costs associated with
construction and operation of the repository.  Our approach toward selecting a thermal load must
take into account the required size and capacity of the proposed repository and the cost implied
by the design.  The imperatives associated with capacity and cost have been re-emphasized in the
debate occurring in Congress on the future direction and funding for the program.   
<p>
We are currently considering a range of design thermal loads that will accommodate at
least the full statutory capacity of a single repository.  This approach is consistent with our
understanding of currently available information and meets the broad objectives of our program. 
Our assessment will be based on a design concept and associated thermal loading that is
supported by the information available at the time.  We will continue to examine alternative
thermal loadings.  We will maintain design and operational flexibility in our design concept to
accommodate new information. 
<p>
<u>Long Term Criticality</u>
<p>
Criticality control for the period following closure of the repository must also be
addressed.  The  Department, as part of its efforts to demonstrate compliance with the
Commission's criticality control requirements for any material being considered for disposal, will
carefully evaluate the risks of potential criticality events in order to ensure the protection of the
health and safety of the public.  Our topical report on partial burnup credit, which we submitted
in May 1995, is intended to initiate consideration by your staff of burnup credit as one element of
a disposal criticality control strategy.  Our near-term objective is to gain sufficient confidence in
our approach to support our design activities.
<p>
<u>Performance Assessment</u>
<p>
Our latest assessment of the performance of a repository at the Yucca Mountain site was
completed in late 1995.  This iteration evaluated the performance of the repository without
incorporating the effects of disruptive events such as volcanism and fault displacement.  Earlier
analyses showed that disruptive events do not appreciably affect the calculated results.  Periodic
climate changes, however, were included in the analyses in terms of potential changes in both
infiltration rate and water table elevation.  The latest assessment utilized more representative
conceptual models of the site.  More importantly, it also incorporated more realistic models for
the behavior of the engineered system.
<p>
Two system-level performance measures were evaluated.  The cumulative radionuclide
releases from the repository were calculated for 10,000 years.  The peak doses resulting from
radionuclide releases were calculated over hundreds of thousands of years.  The results indicate
that the engineered barriers could provide containment and contribute to waste isolation for
extended periods.   The results also indicate that, under certain assumptions, the natural system
by itself can contribute to isolation of the radionuclides for a very long time-period.  The analyses
tend to confirm our understanding of the importance of the rate and distribution of ground-water
movement to the performance of the natural system.  
<p>
A combination of waste package and site performance can be shown to contribute to
containing and isolating radioactive wastes within the Yucca Mountain area for some tens to
even hundreds of thousands of years.  When the period of concern is extended up to 1,000,000
years, only a few factors dominate the calculated response.  In addition, only a few, long-lived
radionuclides contribute significantly to this response.  Our results indicate that the very long-term peak release-rate and the peak dose are affected predominately by dispersion and dilution
processes.  For example, hydrologic conditions that limit transport to diffusion-controlled
processes can delay releases from the engineered barrier system and significantly reduce the peak
release rate.  In addition, the peak dose resulting from these releases is significantly affected by
dilution and dispersion in the underlying aquifer.  Our waste containment and isolation strategy
reflects this understanding of the factors that affect long-term performance, as well as
recognizing the importance of those factors that ensure complete containment of radionuclides
during the early time period when the radionuclide inventory is highest.
<p>
Our next assessment of system performance, which is being scheduled for the 1997-1998
time-frame, will be based more directly on the process-level models that we are developing for
the site and engineered system.  A more sophisticated biosphere model is also expected to be in
place to allow calculation of dose and the associated risk to a representative individual in an
affected population.  The objective for this assessment is to evaluate both the expected
performance of the system and its performance under conditions imposed by potentially
disruptive events, considering appropriate ranges of probabilities of occurrence and of
consequences.
<p>
The 1997-1998 assessment will consider and reflect the site and engineered system
process-level understanding and data available at that time, and will therefore represent the best
estimate of system performance we are likely to have for some time to come.  Because our 1995
assessment used site and design information that is not expected to change drastically, however,
the results from the 1997-1998 assessment will likely indicate better performance, with lower
releases and doses than the 1995 analysis, but not "orders of magnitude" better.  Uncertainties
will continue to exist in the characterization of both engineered component and natural system
processes.  These uncertainties will be reflected in the alternate conceptual models and parameter
distributions that are considered in the analyses.
<p>
We understand that your staff will continue to conduct iterative performance assessments
to help integrate their review across technical areas and to assist in identifying the critical
technical issues for licensing.  We received the report on your latest iterative performance
assessment results and are reviewing it.  We will keep the staff informed as to the progress of our
assessment and welcome comments on our results.  It would facilitate potential future licensing
activity if our approaches to performance assessment were generally consistent, and if we were to
be in general agreement on the key technical issues and uncertainties.  We met with your staff in
November 1995 to exchange views on the key technical issues.  Another meeting is scheduled at
the end of February to discuss the progress we have made in our respective performance
assessment activities.
<p>
<u>Understanding of Site Conditions</u>
<p>
We will not attempt to resolve all issues concerning site conditions during the next few
years.  We will, however, seek to define and understand them well enough that a measurably
improved judgement can be made on the feasibility of repository development at Yucca
Mountain.  This understanding will also enable us to define a defensible set of studies and tests
to resolve the issues remaining for licensing.
<p>
  <u>   Exploratory Studies Facility</u>
<p>     
Our tunnel boring machine (TBM) operations have advanced significantly, exceeding our
fiscal year 1995 milestones.  As of January 18, 1996, the TBM had excavated 3,895 meters
(almost 12,800 feet) into Yucca Mountain, well ahead of schedule.  Four underground test
alcoves have been completed, and sampling and hydrologic testing are underway.  The machine
is currently operating within the proposed repository formation.  It has passed the location where
the thermal testing alcove will be constructed and will soon reach the location of the first planned
alcove to access the Ghost Dance Fault.  We expect to complete the separate excavation by July
that eventually will allow us access to the Ghost Dance Fault itself.  Construction of the alcove
that will be used for thermal testing is expected to be complete by September.  The first in situ
heater test is scheduled to begin in December 1996. 
<p>
Our progress into the mountain over the past year has permitted our scientists and
engineers to begin direct observation and testing of subsurface geologic and hydrologic
conditions, and studies of the engineering properties of the rock and its response to construction
activities.  This information enhanced, and to some degree confirmed, our understanding of site
conditions.  For example, we have yet to observe any water dripping or flowing into the
excavation, even in fractured or faulted zones, or any zones of perched water.  This is consistent
with our hypothesis regarding the character of ground-water flow in the unsaturated rock at
Yucca Mountain.   Information on rock properties and their response to construction enhanced
our understanding of the construction outlook and aided our design of the exploratory studies
facility and the repository.  The rock at the repository level is, in fact, better than we had
anticipated and easier to mine.  We have confirmed our general understanding of the three
dimensional geology and structure at the north end of the repository block, increasing our
confidence in our ability to model subsurface conditions.  No unexpected features, such as major
new faults were observed.  In addition, we found that the Drill Hole Wash structure,  identified at
the surface as a fault several tens of meters wide, is a less significant feature at repository depth
than expected and is unlikely to be a preferential pathway for water movement.  These
observations led to elimination of the need for a planned test alcove.
<p>
Installation of the conveyor system in July 1995 allowed us to replace the muck cars used
during the early phase of construction and, in combination with an aggressive management
strategy that consolidates outages and minimizes TBM downtime, has helped to increase the rate
of progress and reduce the unit cost of construction significantly.  Our aggressive approach to
construction management is being continued into fiscal year 1996.  We expect to complete the
separate excavation that eventually will allow us to access the Ghost Dance Fault itself by July. 
We are looking at opportunities for increasing operating efficiency that could allow us to
continue TBM excavation beyond this point.
<p>
  <u>   Surface-Based Testing</u>
<p>
During fiscal year 1995, we continued to collect information from our surface-based
testing activities, including data on the properties of the rock at depth to support design and
construction of the exploratory studies facility, data on the characteristics of water movement in
the unsaturated and saturated  zones, and data relevant to the evaluation of the waste package 
environment.  We continued to monitor precipitation and meteorological conditions, infiltration
from precipitation events, streamflow and runoff, water levels in wells, and seismicity.  We
analyzed groundwater samples to assess their age and the characteristics of infiltration since
nuclear weapons testing began at the Nevada Test Site.  We also continued our program to
monitor natural infiltration in unsaturated zone boreholes.
<p>
In response to concerns expressed by your staff,  the State of Nevada, and Nye County,
we implemented a program to collect information on the base-line characteristics of pneumatic
flow in Yucca Mountain.  Continuous pneumatic monitoring of selected boreholes, before,
during and after TBM penetration of the non-welded unit of the Paintbrush Tuff, indicates that
Yucca Mountain consists of three distinct pneumatic regimes.  The uppermost regime consists of
the Tiva Canyon welded units, which are extensively fractured, highly interconnected, and show
an immediate response to atmospheric pressure changes.  The Paintbrush Tuff non-welded unit,
which underlies the Tiva Canyon units and overlies the formation in which the repository would
be constructed, shows high matrix water saturations and low fracture density.  Monitoring
indicates that this unit acts as a partial barrier to gas flow, attenuating and delaying response to
atmospheric pressure changes.  This pneumatic data confirms the results from hydrologic
investigations, which indicate that the non-welded unit acts to absorb water infiltrating through
the overlying Tiva Canyon units and to divert it away from the repository horizon.  These results
will be utilized in modeling gas flow in a thermally perturbed repository as part of our next
performance assessment iteration.
<p>
Our results continue to confirm that, consistent with our waste isolation and containment
strategy, the natural system at the site contributes significantly to waste isolation:
<p>
<ul>
<li>precipitation and infiltration are low, and potential evapotranspiration is high;
<p><li>the geologic layer above the repository horizon limits downward movement of water through the repository;
<p><li>most water moves slowly through today's ground-water system;
<p><li>the repository horizon is about 400 meters above today's water table and about 300 meters above the highest water table indicated in the geologic record for Yucca Mountain during the Quaternary period;
<p><li>the mineralogy of rocks underlying repository horizon will slow the movement of radionuclides to the water table; and
<p><li>dilution and dispersion in the aquifer underlying the repository will help limit the doses to members of the public.
</ul>
<p>
Only a few surface-based tests are planned for fiscal year 1996.  Those tests that are
conducted will focus on the hypotheses in our waste containment and isolation strategy.  Testing
at the C-Well complex will continue to obtain data to characterize flow in the saturated zone. 
Monitoring related to characterization of seismicity, meteorological conditions, pneumatic
pathways, and saturated and unsaturated zone hydrology will be continued.
<p>
Attention continues to be focused on the synthesis, analysis, and documentation of the
substantial amount of data collected to date.  Key models of natural processes, including those
for flow and transport in the saturated and unsaturated zones, will be documented and available
by the end of fiscal year 1996.  This documentation will provide input for the design work and
for the next iteration of total system performance assessment that support the viability
assessment.
<p>
<u>Interactions between the Department and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Related to
Geologic Disposal</u>
<p>
During fiscal year 1995, our funding permitted extensive interactions with your staff.  We
met at more than 30 technical exchanges, technical meetings, bi-monthly exploratory studies
facility meetings, and management meetings.  Our respective staffs have met several times over
the last few months to discuss the general outlook for the disposal program, given the funding
situation for fiscal year 1996 and uncertainty over agreement by the Administration and Congress
on new policy direction.  In October, we briefed your staff on the results of our preliminary
planning for fiscal year 1996 for the Yucca Mountain Project.  At that meeting, we noted that
submittal of a license application has been deferred.  We also noted that our previous mutual
expectations regarding various forms of interaction and information exchange are not likely to be
met because of our reduced staff and funding.  We anticipate that any interactions that do occur
will be smaller, less formal, and rely heavily on the use of videoconference and teleconference
facilities.  We will continue our periodic meetings on the exploratory studies facility.  We are
also committed to continuing our periodic management meetings at which higher-level program
issues can be discussed.
<p>
We recognize that although our focus in the near-term is not on submittal of a license
application, we must keep you and your staff informed and preserve the integrity of the work that
is done so that it can ultimately be used in the licensing process.  We expect that you will provide
us feedback if a significant technical issue is not adequately addressed and if failure to do so
would impair our ability to continue progress toward licensing at some point in the future.  For
planning our activities and reaching program decisions, it is important that we have an adequate
understanding of what the critical issues are and what activities are required to resolve them. 
Resolution of all of these issues in the near term may not be possible.  Rather, we seek to
advance our knowledge of these issues to help define a clearly achievable path forward to their
resolution.
<p>
We intend to keep the Commission and your staff informed of our technical work and
products, and of the evaluations we make.  We believe that our semi-annual Site Characterization
Progress Report is an important vehicle to sustain this communication.  We also suggest that the
Commission's On-Site Representatives assume a greater role in communicating to the
Commission and its staff changes in our disposal program, serving as a focal point and conduit
for questions from the staff.  I believe that we need to work together to define effective means of
communication that are appropriate given the necessary changes in our respective roles.
<p>
<u>Topical Reports and Issue Resolution</u>
<p>
During the past year, we continued to pursue our issue resolution initiative in technical
exchanges and through submittal of topical reports.  We have focused on resolving key issues
and I believe that communications have continued to improve.  The utility of the process for
issue resolution has not yet been reflected in resolved issues;  however, your staff has informed
us that they are committed to work toward resolution of several of the issues that we have been
discussing.  We look forward to formal communications regarding these issues.  We have
resolved 99 of the original 198 open items from your staff's Site Characterization Analysis, 
including 9 since December 1994.  Twenty four items are presently being reviewed by your staff.
<p>
Your staff accepted our first topical report on the assessment of seismic hazards for 
review in fiscal year 1995.  We will be providing responses to questions from your staff on this
report in the near future.  Our second Topical Report on seismic design methodology was
submitted in October 1995 and in December your staff accepted it for review.  We look forward
to your staff's completion of their review of that report.
<p>
<u>Quality Assurance and Design Control</u>
<p>
Significant progress was made in the past year in terms of enhancing the overall
effectiveness of our quality assurance program.  We verified through audits that all affected
organizations are satisfactorily implementing the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management Quality Assurance Requirements and Description (QARD) document.  The QARD
is the singular document that describes the quality assurance program used by all affected
organizations.
<p>
We realigned the verification function so that the program's Office of Quality Assurance
performs all audits for affected organizations.  This realignment included establishing a process
for implementing a consolidated Qualified Suppliers List and auditing suppliers.  We also
developed a program-wide system for identifying and correcting conditions adverse to quality,
and for performing trend evaluations.  This included establishment of a trend program database.
<p>
We have been engaged for some time in a dialog with your staff about those aspects  of
our quality assurance program that are relevant to design control.   We agree with the
Commission that it is our responsibility to execute a quality assurance program that meets your
requirements.  We will live up to that responsibility.  Even under a reduced budget, we will
implement our quality assurance program to ensure that what we do during the next few years, in
site characterization, and in the design and construction of the exploratory studies facility, is
adequately documented for use in licensing.
<p>
In October 1994, your staff raised concerns regarding our design control process for the
exploratory studies facility.  They questioned the traceability of the applicable requirements from
10 CFR Part 60 into our design products.  Our submittal of the Regulatory Compliance Review
Report in March 1995 was the first step towards addressing these concerns.  This report provided
evaluations of 15 selected 10 CFR Part 60 requirements.  In August 1995, we submitted a
supplement to the March report that presented an evaluation of the balance of applicable 10 CFR
Part 60 requirements.  We also have evaluated our design control process.  We concluded that the
improvements we instituted in early 1995 and those in process ensure proper consideration of the
applicable requirements in the development of the exploratory studies facility design.
<p>
In April of last year, your staff conducted an in-field verification to determine if
acceptable corrective actions had been effectively implemented in our design control process. 
They made three recommendations regarding exploratory studies facility design.  We are
committed to addressing the recommendations and have taken steps to do so.  Your staff was
planning to conduct another in-field verification following its review of the reports that we
submitted in March and August.  Given our reduced resources for the current fiscal year, we
would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the timing and scope of this second in-field
verification before it commences.
<p>
<u>License Application Annotated Outline</u>
<p>
We will not complete Revision 1 of the License Application Annotated Outline in fiscal
year 1996.  The framework and content of the annotated outline will be used as an internal
information management tool to help guide the development of the technical reports, scientific
reports, and design products that we produce to support the viability assessment.  Further
revisions to the annotated outline text are not planned for the foreseeable future.
 <p>
<u>Licensing Support System</u>
<p>
I briefed you in May 1995 on the status of the Licensing Support System.  The substantial
progress we made over the past year in defining the Licensing Support System and in planning
for the development of this system was a direct result of the collaborative participation of your
staff and the stakeholders.  Unfortunately, under the current funding constraints and direction,
further action on the Licensing Support System is deferred until such time as we are better able to
define our plans and schedule for submittal of an application for construction authorization and
Congress authorizes us to proceed.
<p>
<u>Yucca Mountain Standards</u>
<p>
At present, there are no environmental standards for protection of the public from the
radioactive waste that might be disposed of in a geologic repository at the Yucca Mountain site. 
The uncertainty associated with this situation requires some flexibility in defining our strategy
and plans.  The Energy Policy Act of 1992 directed the Environmental Protection Agency to
promulgate new standards for a repository at the Yucca Mountain site based on and consistent
with the recommendations developed by the National Academy of Sciences.  The 1992 law also
directed the Commission to modify its requirements to be consistent with the new standards.
<p>
<u>National Academy of Sciences Report</u>
<p>
The National Academy of Sciences formed the Committee on Technical Bases for Yucca
Mountain Standards to prepare its recommendations to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
The Committee's report was submitted to the Agency in August 1995.
<p>
The Committee's report observes that there are both technical and institutional
dimensions to the development and approval of a geologic repository.  This observation is
consistent with our view, and what we believe is the Commission's view, that science cannot
provide unqualified assurances over many thousands of years.  The ultimate decisions regarding
disposal will involve societal and economic, as well as technical elements.  We believe that the
Committee's report basically reaffirms the feasibility of geologic disposal.  The report also
recognizes that policy makers need to make decisions regarding a number of issues that lack a
definitive scientific basis.  Through its recommendations, the report puts the question of how
society and policy makers should deal with inter-generational equity on the table for discussion.
<p>
The report notes that predictions of human behavior, even for hundreds of years in the
future, have no scientific basis.  At the same time, however, the report goes on to recommend
compliance assessments against quantitative standards for geologic disposal that would apply for
hundreds of thousands of years into the future, to include the peak annual risk, whenever it
occurs.  It is not clear that quantitative predictions for a period of up to one million years can be
defended in a licensing environment, especially if the attendant uncertainties are not explicitly
recognized and the standard is based on a risk limit that is overly conservative in light of these
uncertainties.  A quantitative standard that focuses the licensing debate upon highly speculative
calculations of exposures as much as one million years into the future, it seems to me, is more
likely to obscure than enlighten the societal decision on the acceptability of geologic disposal at
Yucca Mountain.
<p>
In the absence of a scientific basis for predictions about human behavior and the
biosphere as they relate to the evaluation of individual risk in the far future, the Committee
declared that it is really a policy issue.  The Committee suggested that appropriate (but certainly
hypothetical) assumptions for such evaluations should be made, based on current population and
living habits, and incorporated in the rulemaking.  We believe that this approach is
implementable, provided that the required hypothetical assumptions are explicitly defined in the
standard.
<p>
In developing its recommendations, the Committee also made several technical assertions
that should be carefully evaluated during the rulemaking process.  For example, the Committee
concluded that the geologic framework at Yucca Mountain was either geologically stable or was
expected to vary in such a way as to be predictable over a period on the order of a million years. 
We are not certain that it is reasonable to expect that science can demonstrate and that we can
defend that contention in the licensing process as the basis for conclusions about compliance.  In
general, we believe that some of the technical assertions made by the Committee are also
inherently a matter of judgement and will have to be determined by policy decisions at the
appropriate stage in the rulemaking process and stipulated in the standard or the Commission's
implementing regulation.
<p>
Consequently, we believe that great care needs to be taken by the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in addressing the Committee's
recommendations in their subsequent rulemaking actions.  Whatever standard results from this
process must protect public health and safety and the environment.  It must also be
implementable.  That is, demonstrating compliance with the standard should not require a greater
degree of scientific proof than can reasonably be provided and should not leave policy
judgements to be defended in a licensing process as if they were technical judgements supported
by factual analyses. Promulgating a standard that cannot be implemented may result in the de
facto rejection of the Yucca Mountain site, or even a rejection of the option of geologic disposal. 
Such rejection will not avoid the consequences of long-term radioactive waste management, it
will simply require society to resort to a different, and currently undetermined, long-term
approach.
<p>
We are pleased to note that your staff has established a liaison with the Environmental
Protection Agency and a task force to follow the Agency's rulemaking activities.  Since the
Department will ultimately have to demonstrate compliance with whatever standard is
promulgated, we also intend to be very involved in the rulemaking process.  We provided our
comments on the Committee's report and our recommendations to the Environmental Protection
Agency in November 1995.  We will follow the rulemaking process closely and comment when
appropriate.  We believe that the critical policy issues for rulemaking are: 1) the level of risk that
is considered acceptable and whether that level of risk should depend on the time frame;  2) the
time frame for quantitative compliance assessment and demonstration;  3) the definition of the
reference biosphere, including the critical group and exposure scenarios;  and 4) how human
intrusion will be treated.
<p>
<u>Revisiting the Regulatory Basis for Geologic Disposal</u>
<p>
Although Congress has directed that repository licensing activities should be deferred, the
long-range goal of submitting a successful license application to the Commission remains central
to the Program's mission.  We believe that the program should include a plan and target date for
the submittal of a license application.  It is apparent from recent developments, however, that any
such plan must recognize the budgetary realities or it will have little possibility of being
implemented.  
<p>
As you may recall, the Program Approach for the Yucca Mountain Project that we
adopted in fiscal year 1995 reduced the previously projected cost to submittal of a license
application by about $1 billion.  That plan, which we were pursuing in fiscal year 1995, still
contemplated the expenditure of an additional $3.2 billion on Yucca Mountain from fiscal year
1996 through submittal of the license application in 2001.  We are now expecting to spend only
about $1 billion through fiscal year 1998.
<p>
The implication of these numbers is that, based upon the 1995 program approach, the
completion of a license application would entail an additional $2.5 billion of expenditures after
1998, if the cost of extending the schedule is considered.  It is clear to me that the Congress will
be reluctant to provide those resources, even if the outlook from the viability assessment is
promising.  
<p>
It should be possible to move directly and efficiently from the viability assessment to a
license application, if we find that a repository at Yucca Mountain is indeed viable.  Our
objective should be to design a repository that is compatible with the geologic setting and to
develop a safety case to support a proposal to construct that repository.  The licensing process
should then focus on examining the safety case to determine if public health and safety and the
environment are adequately protected. 
<p>
I believe that it is both possible and necessary to revisit the regulatory basis and the
related expectations that have given rise to our earlier work plans.  Most of the scientific factors
central to those work plans have,  or will have, been addressed by 1998.  Testing related to long
term performance can be done as part of the performance confirmation program during
construction and operations, prior to closure of the repository.  Much of the cost subsequent to
1998 is expected to be associated with the documentation, presentation, and defense of the
results.  In my view, that cost can be significantly reduced if the focus of the licensing review is
on the safety case we make for a specific repository design and its predicted performance in the
geologic setting, rather than on a comprehensive evaluation of all possible aspects of the site.
<p>
With a licensing process that concentrates on the adequacy of a specific proposed facility, 
we can aspire to reestablish a target date for a license application soon after the year 2000 at a
sustainable level of funding.  I believe this is the only way the program can command the
resources needed to retain geologic disposal as a national strategy.  We intend to explore this
approach and we are considering the revisions to our regulations that would be needed to clarify
our intentions.  We intend to keep the Congress, our stakeholders and oversight groups, and, of
course, the Commission, advised of our evaluation.
 <p>    
<u>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation</u>
<p>
We do not yet have new policy direction regarding our role in the near-term management
of spent fuel and we have no access to the $85 million that the Congress set aside for work on an
interim storage facility.  My remarks will be limited, therefore, to the practical considerations of
the major adjustments we had to make to accommodate our funding constraints for this year.  I
will also discuss our contingency plans to maintain the ability to respond should the
Administration and Congress agree on new policy direction.
<p>
<u>Technology Development</u>
<p>
<u>Multi-Purpose Canister System</u>
<p>
The contract to develop the multi-purpose canister system was structured in three phases. 
The first phase of the contract - system design and preparation of safety analysis reports - will be
completed, as scheduled, by April of this year.
<p>
In June 1995, I indicated that we anticipated proceeding with phase two of the contract -
certification and prototype testing - and that applications would be submitted to your staff by
April to support decisions on certification of the multi-purpose canister system for storage and
transportation.  Because of our fiscal year 1996 funding situation, we will not proceed with this
action.
<p>
If the Administration and Congress agree on new policy direction that requires interim
storage to be operational within the next few years, other commercially available technologies
certified by the Commission will have to be utilized.  Private industry may even elect to carry the
design of one or more multi-purpose canister systems forward.
<p>
<u>Multi-Purpose Canister System Environmental Impact Statement</u>
<p>
The scoping process for preparation of the environmental impact statement for a multi-purpose 
canister system was completed in January 1995 and the Implementation Plan was issued
in August.  In response to a comment received from the Navy during the scoping process, the
scope of the environmental impact statement was broadened to include naval as well as civilian
spent nuclear fuel.  Since work on the development of the multi-purpose canister system will not
continue past the design phase, further work on the draft environmental impact statement for the
fabrication and deployment of multi-purpose canisters also has been terminated.  Argonne
National Laboratory, our support contractor for development of the environmental impact
statement, has been directed to complete the preliminary draft document, which will be filed for
future reference. 
<p>
The Navy has decided that it will proceed with that part of the environmental impact
statement covering naval spent nuclear fuel by becoming the lead agency.  The Department will
participate as a cooperating agency.  Since all naval spent fuel is shipped to and stored at Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory, the evaluations will be specific to that location.
<p>
<u>Multi-Purpose Canister - Part 60 Design Considerations Report</u>
<p>
In order to enhance the likelihood that the multi-purpose canister would be found suitable
as a component of the waste package during the repository licensing review, we proposed to your
staff that we develop a technical report that discusses the effects of the use of a multi-purpose
canister on the waste package, the repository environment, and repository operations.  Having
decided not to proceed with submittal of the applications for certification of the multi-purpose
canister system for storage and transportation, we have terminated further work on the Part 60
technical report and will not be submitting it for review by your staff.  We will continue to
interact with your staff on burnup credit as part of our approach for criticality safety, however, as
I will discuss later.
<p>
<u>General Atomics Transportation Casks (GA-4/9)</u>
<p>
The GA-4/9 Legal Weight Truck casks were being developed as part of our overall waste
management system.  The certification process for these two truck casks is underway.  The safety
analysis reports were submitted to the Commission in July and August of 1994.  There are
several major issues that have been discussed between your staff and General Atomics, dealing
with the structural aspects of the design.  Half-scale-model drop tests were completed last month
for the GA-4 cask and initial results indicate that decelerations and strains on the model were
consistent with the analytical predictions.
<p>
We are unable to provide additional funds for the certification of these casks.  We intend
to make this technology available to private industry and they may elect to pursue certification.
<p>
<u>Dry Transfer System</u>
<p>
Over the last few years, we have also been working with the Electric Power Research
Institute on the design of a dry transfer system for spent nuclear fuel.  The system will enable the
transfer of individual spent fuel assemblies between conventional, top-loading casks and canister
systems.  The design of the system is being developed by Transnuclear under a subcontract with
the Electric Power Research Institute.   The proposed design incorporates technology and
experience from the French dry-transfer operations at La Hague and from Federal and
commercial facilities in the United States.
<p>
The Electric Power Research Institute delivered a final design report to the Department in
December 1995 and a draft Topical Safety Analysis Report is expected in February.  We plan to
submit the topical report to your staff later this year for review and acceptance.
<p>
We are currently negotiating with the Idaho Operations Office of the Department's Office
of Environmental Management regarding a cost-shared project to fabricate and demonstrate the
dry transfer system at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.  The system could assist the
Department in meeting its near-term spent fuel management commitments to the State of Idaho. 
It could also benefit early operations at any interim storage facility.  Our intent is to begin
fabrication this fiscal year and complete the demonstration by the end of 1997.
<p>
<u>Dry Storage Research</u>
<p>
The program maintains spent nuclear fuel in storage casks at the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory.  This spent fuel has been in dry storage longer than any other fuel in this
country.  The casks are routinely monitored to provide information regarding the behavior of the
spent fuel in storage and could provide valuable information for licensing by the Commission of
extended dry storage.  This work has been funded from the Civilian Research and Development
appropriation, since the Nuclear Waste Fund cannot be used for generic research.  The
appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996 did not provide funds to continue this activity and we
have asked your staff to consider taking over this project.
<p>
<u>Criticality Safety</u>
<p>
Criticality safety is an important issue that must be addressed in the design and operation
of our integrated nuclear waste management system.  Obtaining appropriate credit for burn up of
fissile material in the spent fuel continues to be a priority for the Department.  The  Department
believes that efficient geologic disposal at a reasonable cost requires consideration of burnup
credit for the design of waste packages.  Burnup credit also allows spent fuel transportation cask
capacities to be maximized, which provides benefits in terms of both reduced public risk and cost
savings.  Considering the large quantity of spent nuclear fuel to be handled by the federal waste
management system, there are substantial incentives for using burnup credit in the design of
storage, transportation, and disposal packages.
<p>
In May 1995, we submitted to your staff a topical report on burnup credit for actinides
only.  In December, we responded to initial comments from your staff.  This first topical report 
provides what we believe is the basis for your acceptance of the use of partial burnup credit.  It 
includes a special cask loading procedure that would provide the assurance necessary for later
consideration of full burnup credit.  We intend to continue our interactions on the use of partial
burnup credit.
<p>
We had intended to continue to gather data and conduct tests and experiments to support
the use of full burnup credit.  Once we had obtained sufficient data, we would have submitted a
second topical report on full burnup credit to your staff.  Under our restructured program, we
have deferred our work to establish the basis for use of full burnup credit until a later date.
<p>
<u>Contingency Plans</u>
<p>
We have done some contingency planning for interim storage to maintain our ability to
respond aggressively should the Administration and Congress agree on new policy direction. 
Our contingency planning has considered development of a market-driven national transportation
capability.  This capability would utilize commercially available transportation and storage
equipment that has been certified by the Commission.  Our contingency planning also considered
non-site specific engineering work and preparation of a Topical Safety Analysis Report that
would be needed if we were to begin the licensing process.
<p>
If Congress and the Administration agree to new policy direction authorizing the
development of a federal interim storage facility at a specific site, the program will aggressively
act on that direction and submit a license application to the Commission at the earliest
practicable date.  We believe that the establishment of the Commission's Spent Fuel Project
Office will facilitate the licensing of such a facility.
<p>
<u>Interactions between the Department and Nuclear Regulatory Commission Related to Federal
Interim Storage</u>
<p>
The level of interactions between the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the
Department regarding interim storage and related topics is expected to increase dramatically if
the Administration and Congress should agree on the policy direction for the development of this
facility.  In the meantime, and under our current funding limitations, we will continue
interactions with the Spent Fuel Project Office on generic issues associated with interim storage.
<p>
The Department understands that the Commission is currently engaged in rulemaking to
update its criteria applicable to new commercial reactors for seismic hazard evaluation and
design in 10 CFR Part 100.  The proposed revisions direct an applicant to provide a probabilistic
seismic hazard evaluation in its safety analysis report.  We believe that 10 CFR Part 72 should be
revised to refer to the new provisions of Part 100, as they would relate to the design of an interim
storage facility, once the rulemaking for Part 100 is complete.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
I am grateful that the working relationship between our staffs has been strengthened.  In
light of the funding situation for the current fiscal year and the continuing debate in Congress, it
is likely that these relationships will be tested and that both of our organizations will have to
accommodate new and possibly dramatic policy redirection.  At a minimum, we will have to
accommodate the significant change in focus and expectations that will govern the activities of
the repository program for at least the current fiscal year.  We may also have to respond to
intense, near-term licensing interactions undertaken in response to enactment of legislation
providing new policy direction on interim storage.  I hope we can draw upon the experience of
many years and the strength of our organizational relationships to maintain progress toward
development of a geologic repository as we address whatever policy redirection we get.
<p>
Thank you for the opportunity to brief the Commission.  I would be happy to answer any
questions you may have.

                   Spent Fuel Storage Workshop
                         January 24, 1996
                         Washington, D.C.
</pre></h3></head>
<p><body><h4>
Introduction
<p>
When I appeared before this group a year ago, the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
program had arrived at a program plan which was adequately funded and which had ambitious
but feasible targets both for decisions about the repository, and for the development of canister
and transportation cask technologies.  
<p>
That was then.  This is now!  In the fiscal year 1996 budget, the Congress effectively
eliminated the program approach we had initiated.
<p>
Current Status
<p>
We are continuing to make progress despite the draconian budget cuts.  At Yucca Mountain, the
tunnel boring machine continues to operate well ahead of schedule.  It has excavated more than
two miles and is well into the repository formation itself.  Our hypothesis that little or no water is
moving at the proposed repository horizon has been strengthened.  Direct observations at the
repository horizon have not revealed any potential disqualifying conditions.  We have reached
the planned location of the access point for the heater test alcove and preparations are being made
to commence the tests later this year.    
<p>
The tunnel machine is at the point from which we will drill and then tunnel into the Ghost Dance
Fault, which is a major geologic formation in the repository area.  I expect important results from
the exploration of the fault at repository depths.  
<p>
Program Outlook
<p>
The budget, however, has had major impacts upon the current work and long-term targets.  In
September of 1995, in anticipation of reduced funding, we had to eliminate approximately 875
contractor positions, primarily at the Yucca Mountain  Project.  Final action on the Appropriation
proved to be worse than expected.  The Congress appropriated $400 million for the program
rather than the $630 million requested.  The Conference committee, however, inserted language
in the Appropriations Act requiring that $85 million of the funds appropriated shall be available
only for an interim storage facility and only upon the enactment of specific statutory authority. 
This language effectively left the program with $315 million to conduct all program activities in
fiscal year 1996.  
<p>
In managing the second phase of the reduction, we have tried to avoid further impacts on the
Yucca Mountain Project.  An additional 200 positions in the areas of quality assurance, program
integration, program management and waste acceptance were eliminated.  We had to terminate
most of our waste acceptance, canister development, and transportation work.  Our cooperative
agreements will be funded at substantially reduced levels.  We will stop work on the multi-purpose canister system after the design phase is completed in the spring of 1996.  Development
and certification of legal-weight truck casks for transportation of spent fuel will also cease.
<p>
I hope and expect that the private sector will bring appropriate canister technologies to the
marketplace to serve whatever storage, transportation and disposal scenario evolves.  I am
concerned that a proliferation of site-specific responses to the immediate needs of at-reactor
storage, along with expedient responses to emerging transportation requirements, could lead to
an inefficient system and possibly create a challenging management problem at a later time.  I
hope marketplace forces, the industry, and its regulators will avoid that outcome.
<p>
The Congress directed that the repository program be reduced to focus on the core scientific
activities.  The Congress recognized that the submittal of a license application would be deferred. 
As a result of the reduced funding, our program target dates for constructing the repository and
emplacing waste also have had to be indefinitely deferred.  
<p>
As Congress directed, we will concentrate our work on the unanswered technical questions
regarding the conceptual design of the repository and its expected performance.  Our objectives
will be to conclude whether the technologies are in hand to construct a repository at the Yucca
Mountain site and then to evaluate its probable performance, based upon the wealth of data we
already have, or will have by 1998 and the design concept we will have developed.By 1998, we will complete a package of deliverables:  
<p>
     First,  more specific design work on the critical elements of the repository and the waste
     package.  Those aspects of the repository and waste package design that are critical to
     performance, cost, and technical feasibility will be advanced beyond the conceptual stage,
     for the 1998 target.
<p>
     Second, a total system performance assessment, based upon this design and the
     characterization data available to us, which will describe the probable behavior of the
     repository.
<p>
     Third, a plan and cost estimate for the remaining work required to complete a license
     application.
 <p> 
     And finally, an estimate of the costs to construct and operate the repository.
<p>
This assessment will clarify the most uncertain aspects of geologic disposal at Yucca Mountain. 
The components will make important contributions toward the development of a Secretarial
recommendation to the President and preparation of a license application to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission; but they will not be sufficient for either of these formal actions.
<p>
The long-range goal of submitting a successful application for a repository license to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission remains central to the Program's mission.  We believe that the program
should include a plan and target date for the submittal of a license application.  It is apparent
from recent developments, however, that we cannot, as a practical matter, expect funding for all
of the work included in our previous approach.  
<p>
Prospects for Licensing
<p>
The new Program Approach we adopted in fiscal year 1995 reduced the previously projected cost
of licensing the Yucca Mountain Project by about one billion dollars.  That approach still
required an additional $3.2 billion on Yucca Mountain from fiscal year 1996 through the license
application in 2001.  We are now expecting to spend about $1 billion through fiscal year 1998.
<p>
The implication of these numbers is that, based upon the 1995 program approach, the completion
of a license application would probably entail an additional $2.5 billion of expenditures after
1998, if the cost of extending the schedule is considered.  It is clear to me that the Congress will
be reluctant to provide those resources, even if the outlook in 1998 is promising.  
<p>
I believe that it is both possible and necessary to revisit the regulatory basis that has given rise to
our earlier work plans.  Most of the scientific factors central to those work plans have,  or will
have, been addressed by 1998.  Much of the subsequent cost will be associated with the
documentation, presentation and defense of the results.  In my view, that cost can be significantly
reduced if the focus of the presentation and the licensing review is on the predictive performance
of the repository and on the safety case made for a specific repository design,  rather than on a
comprehensive discourse on site characterization.  I believe that we can aspire to reestablish a
target date for a license application soon after the year 2000 at a sustainable level of program
funding.  We intend to explore this approach and we are considering the revisions to our
regulations that would be needed to clarify our intentions.
<p>      
Beyond Fiscal Year 1996
<p>
This Administration remains committed to geologic disposal.  The new targets for a repository 
that are practicable will depend upon the policy and regulatory framework and upon our
expectations for future funding.  
<p>
Meanwhile, the Congress is still considering bills that would initiate an immediate start on
interim storage and potentially free the $85 million frozen by the fiscal year 1996 Appropriation
Act.  The House has not yet brought H.R. 1020, a comprehensive authorization bill, to the floor. 
S. 1271, a comparable bill, has been introduced in the Senate and a hearing was held in
December.    
<p>
Testifying at that hearing,  Secretary O'Leary expressed the Administration's opposition to the
Senate measure.  The Administration is concerned that an immediate interim storage initiative, in
the face of probable budgetary constraints, would place the repository program in jeopardy and
reduce the policy commitment to the long term strategy of geologic disposal.   The President has
also expressed his opposition to the peremptory designation of Nevada as a site for an interim
storage facility.
<p>
Closing
<p>
Certainly the past year has been an eventful one for this program.  As I have often found to be the
situation, a great deal of policy has already been made by indirection, without the enactment of a
policy measure by the Congress and a Presidential approval.  The FY 1996 budget cycle and the
debate in the Congress has already set some new constraints on the Program.  The responses we
have already made will shape its future.  
<p>
If we receive even modest future funding, I am confident that the direction we are now taking
will, by 1998, answer the important outstanding technical questions regarding the feasibility of
building the repository.  If there is an aspect of the geologic setting that seriously contradicts our
hypotheses, we are likely to discover it by 1998.  If there are shortcomings in the available
technologies or in our engineering ability to implement the design concepts, they will have
become evident by then.  Society's ability to evaluate geologic disposal will become much less
philosophical and much more practical.  It will become very clear how the geologic disposal
option compares to alternatives.  Whether or not interim storage is authorized, it would be bad
public policy to abandon the repository program without that information.
<p>
 Thank you for your attention.

</head></pre></h3>
<body><h4><p>
Introduction
<p>
Thank you for the opportunity to speak to the Board again about the status of the program and
the outlook.  You will be hearing from several members of our staff on topics you have asked
us to address at this meeting.  Since my last meeting with you in October, there have been
some important policy developments.  I will use my time to address them.  
<p>
Current Status
<p>
I appreciated the Board's letter to Congress last month highlighting our progress at Yucca
Mountain.  We are continuing to make progress despite the draconian budget cuts in the fiscal
year 1996 appropriation.      
<p>
The tunnel boring machine continues to operate well ahead of schedule.  As of January 8, 1996,
it has excavated 12,154.8 feet (3674.3 meters) into Yucca Mountain, more than 4692 feet (1430
meters)  ahead of schedule.  Ground conditions at the repository level have been good in recent
months.  Our hypothesis that little or no water is moving at the proposed repository horizon has
been strengthened. Direct observations at the repository horizon have not revealed any potential
disqualifying conditions.  We have reached the planned location of the access point for the
underground thermal test alcove and preparations are being made  to commence the tests later
this year.  The thermal testing alcove design and the planned tests will be discussed later today.  
<p>
Later this month, we anticipate that the tunnel boring machine will also reach the first planned
access point to the Ghost Dance Fault.  I expect important results from the exploration of the
fault at repository depths.  
<p>
Program Outlook
<p>
When I spoke to you in October,  we were operating under a continuing resolution that limited
the program to $400 million.  We had taken action in September 1995 in anticipation of reduced
funding, to eliminate approximately 875 contractor positions, primarily at the Yucca Mountain 
Project.  These reductions affected the program's management and operating contractor and its
teammates, the US Geological Survey and other program participants.
<p>
Shortly after your October meeting, the Conference committee adopted the Senate's
recommendation that $400 million be made available to the program in fiscal year 1996. 
However, the Conference committee inserted language in the Appropriations Bill that stated that
$85 million of the funds appropriated shall be available only for an interim storage facility and
only upon the enactment of specific statutory authority.  This language effectively left the
program with $315 million to conduct program activities in fiscal year 1996.  
<p>
In managing this additional 20 percent cut, we have tried to avoid further impacts on the Yucca
Mountain Project.  An additional 200 positions in the areas of quality assurance, program
integration, program management and waste acceptance were eliminated.  We terminated most of
our waste acceptance, canister development, and transportation work.  We will stop work on the
multi-purpose canister system after the design phase is completed in the spring of 1996. 
Development and certification of legal-weight truck casks for transportation of spent fuel will
cease.  Our cooperative agreements will be funded at substantially reduced levels.
<p>
The Conference Report directed that the repository program be reduced to focus on the core
scientific activities and recognized that preparation and submittal of a license application would
be deferred.  As a result, of the reduced funding, our program target dates for constructing the
repository and emplacing waste also have been indefinitely deferred.  
<p>
As Congress directed, and as I proposed at your October meeting, we will concentrate our work
on the unanswered technical questions regarding the conceptual design of the repository and its
expected performance.  The objectives will be to conclude whether the technologies are in hand
to construct a repository at the Yucca Mountain site and to evaluate its probable performance
based upon the wealth of data we already have, or will have by 1998.
 <p>
We have defined a new milestone for the Yucca Mountain Project in the form of specific work
products that will contribute to a "viability assessment," which will be completed in 1998.  As I
described to you last October, the specific work products are:  
<p>
     First,  more specific design work on the critical elements of the repository and the waste
     package.  Our plan for fiscal year 1996 is to document the current conceptual level of
     detail for the repository and waste package design.  For the viability assessment, only
     those aspects of the repository and waste package design that are critical to performance,
     cost, and technical feasibility will be advanced beyond the conceptual stage.
<p>
     Second, a total system performance assessment, based upon this design concept and the
     characterization data available to us, which will describe the probable behavior of the
     repository.
<p>
     Third, a plan and cost estimate for the remaining work required to complete a license
     application.
<p>  
     And finally, an estimate of the costs to construct and operate the repository.
<p>
This viability assessment is not the same as the technical site suitability evaluation contemplated
in the previous Program Approach.  The viability assessment is intended to clarify the most
uncertain aspects of geologic disposal at Yucca Mountain.  The components of the assessment
will make important contributions toward  the development of a Secretarial recommendation to
the President and preparation of  a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission;
but they will not be sufficient for either of these formal actions.
<p>
Although repository licensing activities are indefinitely deferred because of the 1996
appropriation, the long-range goal of submitting a successful license application to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission remains central to the Program's mission.  We believe that the program
should include a plan and target date for the  submittal of a license application.  It is apparent
from recent developments, however, that any such plan that depends upon funding levels beyond
reasonable expectations would constitute a de facto decision to abandon the repository initiative
prior to the license application.  
<p>
Prospects for Licensing
<p>
As you may recall, the new Program Approach we adopted in fiscal year 1995 reduced the
projected cost of licensing the Yucca Mountain Project by about one billion dollars.  The
program plan we were pursuing in fiscal year 1995, however, still contemplated the expenditure
of an additional $3.2 billion on Yucca Mountain from fiscal year 1996 through the license
application in 2001.  We are now expecting to spend about $1 billion through fiscal year 1998,
which will contribute to the work needed for an application.
<p>
The implication of these numbers is that, based upon the 1995 program approach, the completion
of a license application would entail an additional $2.5 billion of expenditures after 1998, if the
cost of extending the schedule is considered.  It is clear to me that the Congress will be reluctant
to provide those resources, even if the outlook from the viability assessment is promising.  
<p>
Several years ago Chairman Cantlon noted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that the
repository program's premature focus on demonstrating compliance with the details of the
regulations contributed to the program's excessive cost and schedule.  This is one aspect of the
problem.  It should be possible to move directly and efficiently from the viability assessment to a
license application,  if we find that a repository at Yucca Mountain is indeed viable.  The
objective should be to design a repository that is compatible with the geologic setting and to
develop a safety case to support a proposal to construct that repository.  The licensing process
should then focus on examining the safety case to determine if public health and safety and the
environment are adequately protected. 
<p>
I believe that it is both possible and necessary to revisit the regulatory basis that has given rise to
our earlier work plans.  Most of the scientific factors central to those  work plans have,  or will
have, been addressed by 1998.  Testing related to long term performance can be done through the
performance confirmation program during construction and operations prior to closure of the
repository.  Much of the subsequent cost is associated with the documentation and presentation
and defense of the results.  In my view, that cost can be significantly reduced if the focus of the
presentation and the licensing review is on the predictive performance of the repository and on
the safety case made for a specific repository design,  rather than on  a comprehensive discourse
on site characterization.
<p>
In the former case, those factors that are critical to the waste isolation strategy and to the other
vital engineering, safety, and environmental considerations, such as criticality, will be thoroughly
presented and supported.  Those factors that prove to be less relevant can be bounded and put in
perspective with still rigorous but much less elegant trappings for documentation and review.
<p>
If this approach retains the essential requirements of a licensing process that concentrates on the
adequacy of a specific proposed facility, I believe that we can aspire to reestablish a target date
for a license application soon after the year 2000 at a sustainable level of funding.  I believe this
is the only way the program can command the resources needed to retain geologic disposal as a
national strategy.
<p>
We intend to explore this approach and we are considering the revisions to our regulations that
would be needed to clarify our intentions.  We intend to keep the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, our other regulators, the Congress, and
stakeholders, and, of course, the Board advised of our evaluation.
<p>  
Beyond Fiscal Year 1996
<p>
The Administration remains committed to geologic disposal.  The new targets for a repository 
that are practicable will depend upon the policy and regulatory framework within which the
program will operate and upon our expectations for future funding.  In planning this program,
however, given the current environment, I am reluctant to assume that we will receive future
funding levels that are very much greater than the current fiscal year.
<p>
Meanwhile, the Congress is still considering bills that would initiate an immediate start on
interim storage and potentially free the $85 million frozen by the fiscal year 1996 Appropriation
Act.  The House has not yet brought H.R. 1020, a comprehensive authorization bill, to the floor. 
S. 1271, a comparable bill, has been introduced in the Senate and a hearing was held in
December.    
<p>
Testifying at that hearing,  Secretary O'Leary expressed the Administration's opposition to the
Senate measure.  The Administration is concerned that an immediate interim storage initiative, in
the face of probable budgetary constraints, would place the repository program in jeopardy and
reduce the policy commitment to the long term strategy of geologic disposal.   The President has
also expressed his opposition to the peremptory designation of Nevada as a site for an interim
storage facility.  The Secretary proposed that the following principles guide consideration of
legislation:
<p>
     First, we must maintain the momentum which has been attained in the repository
     investigation.  This can be done by funding the program at a level that is adequate to
     resolve the major remaining technical uncertainties to support a viability assessment by
     1998.  Such funding will allow us to make an assessment of the viability of licensing and
     constructing a repository at the Yucca Mountain site.  If Yucca Mountain is a viable site
     for a repository, we would expect to prepare the environmental impact statement, a
     formal recommendation to the President, and license application.
<p>
     Second, we must revise the regulatory structure that guides the licensing of the repository. 
     Such revisions should reflect the experience of the past decade, the policy changes
     already adopted, and the realities of budgetary constraints while maintaining necessary
     health and safety constraints.
<p>
     Third, the selection of a site for interim storage should be based upon objective criteria.  
     The consideration of Nevada as a candidate site, or the determination of the need to
     consider other candidate sites should await the results of the 1998 viability assessment of
     the Yucca Mountain repository.
<p>
     Fourth, the program should be authorized and directed to initiate generic interim storage
     activities using the $85 million already appropriated and reserved for that purpose.  This
     would include requests for proposals to develop the nationwide transportation effort
     needed to transfer spent nuclear fuel from reactors to an interim storage facility, wherever
     it is located.  The generic activities could also include non-site-specific engineering work
     that would assist in beginning the licensing process.
<p>
     And most importantly, we must maintain standards and procedures that will assure that
     the health and safety of the public and workers and the environment will be protected.
<p>
Closing
<p>
Certainly the past year has been an eventful one for this program.  As I have often found to be the
situation, a great deal of policy has already  been made by indirection, without the enactment of a
policy measure by the Congress and a Presidential approval.  The FY 1996 budget cycle and the
debate in the Congress has already set some new constraints on the Program.  The responses we
have already made will shape its future.  
<p>
If we receive even modest future funding, I am confident that the direction we are now taking
will, by 1998, answer the important outstanding technical questions regarding the feasibility of
building the repository.  If there is an aspect of the geologic setting that seriously contradicts our
hypotheses and that will require substantial additional data collection, analyses, and modeling,
we are likely to discover it by 1998.  If there are shortcomings in the available technologies or in
our engineering ability to implement the design concepts they will have become evident.  
<p>
As the results of that work, society's ability to evaluate the feasibility of geologic disposal should
become much less philosophical and much more practical.  It will become very clear how the
geologic disposal option compares to alternatives.  That result is worth the resources needed and
the only responsible course of action.
<p>
 Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to a productive meeting with the Board.

<TITLE> International nuclear waste programs</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="../../pictures/int300.gif"><HR>
Managing nuclear waste has become a multinational concern as more and more of the worlds electricity is generated by nuclear power plants.  To assure an exchange of information on nuclear waste management, cooperative programs have evolved among countries and various international agencies. The United States
Department of Energy (DOE) has bilateral  agreements with Belgium, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.<P>

The U.S. also is one of 113 members of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is a member of the Nuclear Energy
Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (NEA/OECD), and cooperates with the
Commission of the European Communities.    Through  such cooperation, nations share the cost of nuclear waste disposal testing programs; exchange information, technology, and experience; and develop a  consensus to
improve confidence in the safety of each nations disposal system.<P>

<H2><B>International Cooperative Programs</B></H2>
<HR>

The U.S. bilateral agreements with Belgium, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are primarily to
exchange information on waste treatment, packaging, and storage; radionuclide transport; transportation; environmental effects; and public acceptance.  The U.S. cooperated with Canada in an experimental program at the Underground Research Laboratory in Manitoba.  DOE exchanges information with Switzerland concerning testing at the Grimsel Pass Underground Research Laboratory.  The U.S. also cooperates in the development of disposal technology through participation   in NEAs Stripa projects in Sweden.  In addition, DOE cooperated with the Federal Republic of Germany on in situ tests at the Asse salt mine from 1981-1987.<P>

France and the U.S. conduct technical workshops on low-level and transuranic waste management.  The United States participates with Brazil, Sweden, Switzerland,  and the United Kingdom in the Joint International Pocos de Caldas project, which is a natural analog study.  Briefings or technical information have been provided by the U.S. to Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Spain, and Taiwan.  DOE and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have participated with other countries in mathematical and computer code comparison projects to verify radionuclide transport computer codes, validate the underlying mathematical models, and determine  the adequacy of the models for real problems.<P>

<H2><B>International Agencies and Organizations</B></H2>
<HR>
DOE, NRC, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency contribute to International Atomic Energy Agency
studies by providing technical experts and attending symposia. DOE also sponsors participation in the waste management committee of the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD.  In addition, the U.S. has a bilateral agreement with the Commission of the European Communities for waste disposal research.<P>


DOE also takes part in a number of multinational public information activities.  Participating countries exchange
information on respective program progress and public concerns.  The countries also undertake joint projects
such as the development of brochures and position papers which are published in several languages.<P>

<TITLE>Educational Materials</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1><B>Science, Society, and America's Nuclear Waste</B></H1>
<HR>
<H2><B>RESOURCE CURRICULUM</B></H2>
<P>
It is important that today's students understand what nuclear
waste is and how it can be disposed of safely. The Science, Society,
and America's Nuclear Waste resource curriculum, produced by the
U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management (OCRWM), assists educators by providing educational
materials that encourage hands-on, real-world experiences significant
to today's students.
<P>
The resource curriculum, designed for use in grades 8-12, contains
materials for both students and teachers. Student materials include
readings, review exercises, and activities. For teachers, supplemental
teaching aids include videotapes, computer software, and viewgraphs.
<P>
<I>Science, Society, and America's Nuclear Waste </I>is modular
and flexible. There are four units, each with a core of basic
information supplemented by enrichment readings, exercises, and
activities. The units can be used in their entirety or selectively,
depending on student background, ability, interest, and time.
<H3>Unit 1: Nuclear Waste</H3>

<P>
Unit 1 helps establish the relevance of the topic of nuclear waste
to everyday lives and activities. It provides an examination of
the different types of nuclear waste and the geographic distribution
of spent nuclear fuel in the United States. The relationship between
the total volume and radioactivity of nuclear waste is also explored.
Review activities explain energy, electricity, and the nuclear
fission process. Students are given the opportunity to: 
<UL>
<LI>Discuss various energy sources used to generate electricity

<LI>List and define the four categories of nuclear waste and state
how each type of waste is or will be disposed of 
<LI>Discuss the relevance of nuclear waste in their lives.
</UL>

<H3>Unit 2: Ionizing Radiation</H3>

<P>
Unit 2 conveys factual information about radioactivity and radiation
and relates that information to the personal lives of students
and to the management and disposal of nuclear waste. Students
experiment and learn that, although radiation cannot be detected
with the senses, it is possible to study radiation and radioactive
decay through indirect observation. Students also address the
concept of ionizing radiation, learning that it exists in nature
and can result from human activity. Student learn to: 
<UL>
<LI>Define ionizing radiation and name both natural and manmade
sources 
<LI>State how many millirem of exposure the average American receives
annually 
<LI>Complete a chart on half-lives of radioisotopes and explain
its significance.
</UL>

<H3>Unit 3: Nuclear Waste Policy Act</H3>

<P>
Unit 3 presents our Nation's nuclear waste dilemma and introduces
the U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA). Risks specifically associated
with nuclear waste are explored, and students examine their own
risk judgments through hands-on activities. Upon completion of
this unit, students are able to: 
<UL>
<LI>Name the key provisions of the NWPA and identify the agencies
involved in the high-level radioactive waste management program

<LI>Discuss whether this generation of future generations should
provide for disposal of nuclear waste currently in storage 
<LI>Identify how and why the NWPA provides for public participation

<LI>Identify major steps involved in completing a complex project

<LI>Discuss probabilities and risk assessment on an introductory
level.
</UL>

<H3>Unit 4: Waste Management System</H3>

<P>
Unit 4 explains how elements of the high-level nuclear waste management
system will work together to provide both short- and long-term
protection of people and the environment. Major elements of the
high-level nuclear waste management system include storage, transportation,
and disposal in a geologic repository. Upon completion of this
unit, students are able to: 
<UL>
<LI>Discuss transportation safety standards 
<LI>Define the role of interim storage 
<LI>Evaluate characteristics important in repository siting.
</UL>

<P>
The curriculum is available to educators free of charge. To order
copies, including both Teachers Guides and Student Readers, call 1-800-225-NWPA (6972).

<HR>
The U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) has produced a number of videotapes about the Nation's civilian radioactive waste management system.  OCRWM videos are available to the public free of charge through the OCRWM National Information Center.  You may order videos by calling 1-800-225-6972 (202-488-6720 in the Washington, D.C., area), or by <A HREF="/comments/compage1.htm">sending us a message</A>.<P>
<P>
<CITE>Geologic Disposal: Yucca Mountain Project (August 1996, Playing Time: 9:30)</CITE><P>
<P>
Presented in this video is an overview of the history of the Yucca Mountain Project and the geologic and engineering studies being conducted in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and in the Exploratory Studies Facility.  The results of this scientific research will demonstrate whether Yucca Mountain could serve as the Nation's first geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  The video concludes with an explanation of the government approvals that must be obtained before a repository could become operational, and the periods of time required for repository construction, emplacement of the waste, and closure.<P>
<P>
<CITE>OCRWM 1996 Compilation Videotape (May 1996, Playing Time: 2 Hours)</CITE><P>
<P>
Eight videotapes have been compiled onto this one video to offer a wide view of various elements of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program.  The video segments include "Managing the Nation's Nuclear Waste," "Why Study Yucca Mountain?  To Solve an Environmental Problem," "Sample Management Facility," "Hydrology Research Facility," "Five Full-Scale Cask Tests," "Cultural Resources Program," "Radiation: Fact or Myth?", and "Traces of the Future" (listed below).<P>
<P>
<CITE>Traces of the Future: Lessons from Nature for Waste Disposal (Playing Time: 52:00)</CITE><P>
<P>
In this video, scientists explain how they are able to learn about the movement and transport of radionuclides in different types of rock and ground water by observing and studying naturally radioactive materials, such as uranium ore deposits, which have existed for millions of years.  International collaboration among scientists in conducting these natural analog studies, combined with laboratory studies, add confidence to the concept of deep geologic disposal.<P>
<P>
<CITE>Yucca Mountain Project New Work Update (August 1996, Playing Time: 8:00)</CITE><P>
<P>
This videotape presents an overview of the scientific activities made by the Yucca Mountain Project since January 1996.  Information is presented on tunneling and test alcove construction for the Exploratory Studies Facility, moisture patterns and dormant volcanoes in the Yucca Mountain area, and the progress being made toward completing the most significant elements of the Yucca Mountain study by 1998.<P>
<P>
<CITE>Yucca Mountain Project 1995 Year in Review (Playing Time: 9:00)</CITE><P>
<P>
This Year-in-Review videotape presents an overview of the significant progress made by the Yucca Mountain Project during 1995.  Highlights cover the Exploratory Studies Facility, the surface-based testing program, development of an Environmental Impact Statement for a potential repository at Yucca Mountain, and public outreach efforts.<P>
<P>
<CITE>Yucca Mountain Project Update: 1994 Year in Review (Playing Time: 7:00)</CITE><P>
<P>
This video reports on the recent scientific studies conducted during 1994 at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, to determine its suitability as a high-level radioactive waste repository.  Included is footage of the Tunnel Boring Machine that is being used to gather information on rock structures expected to be encountered in the Tunnel Boring Machine's pathway, seismic studies, and investigation of perched water.  The video also explains management initiatives at Yucca Mountain to ensure that studies stay on schedule and budget, and focus on information necessary to determine suitability and complete a license application.  Increased efforts to involve and inform the public about the scientific studies being carried out at Yucca Mountain are also described. <P><P></BODY></HTML>

<TITLE>Letters to Stakeholders on Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H2>Letter to Stakeholders: How OCRWM Program Changes Impact the Office of Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation.</H2><HR>
June 12, 1996
<p>
Dear Colleague:<br>
<p>
This letter serves as a brief update to my February 8, 1996, letter to you concerning changes to
the Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM)
program, specifically as they impact the Office of Waste Acceptance, Storage and
Transportation.
<p>
As a result of Congressional guidance provided through the Fiscal Year 1996 appropriations
process and future funding profiles, we are developing a revised Program Plan.  The
accomplishments of Fiscal Year 1995 have allowed us to reduce expenditures while maintaining
momentum toward our fundamental program objectives at Yucca Mountain.  We will
concentrate work at Yucca Mountain on the most significant outstanding technical and
engineering issues and complete the necessary portions of the Exploratory Studies Facility, with
a viability assessment in 1998.  
<p>
<strong>Budget.</strong>  For Fiscal Year 1997, $400 million has been requested to continue its efforts for both
the Yucca Mountain and Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation projects. 
<p>
<strong>Waste Acceptance and Transportation Strategy.</strong>  In Fiscal Year 1996, we are developing a
waste acceptance and transportation strategy that relies on the private sector for implementation,
so that fuel can be accepted from utilities and moved to an interim storage facility or a repository
as soon as either is available.  An acquisition strategy for equipment and services is being
developed, and industry and vendor views are being solicited through an Expression of Interest
notice in the Commerce Business Daily (May 24, 1996) and Federal Register (May 28, 1996).  A
copy of the Federal Register notice is enclosed for your information.  We will be prepared to
issue requests for proposals and award contracts if and when we receive direction to proceed with
near-term spent fuel interim storage.  This approach will offer a market stimulus for private
sector development of the requisite equipment and technology.
<p>
<strong>Section 180(c) Notice of Proposed Policy and Procedures.</strong>  On May 16, 1996, we issued a
Federal Register Notice of our proposed policy and procedures to implement Section 180(c) of
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (copy enclosed).  Comments should be sent to the Department and
must be received on or before August 15, 1996.  We plan to issue the final policy and procedures
in June 1997.  
<p>
<strong>Multi-Purpose Canister/Legal-Weight Truck Casks.</strong>  The contract awarded to Westinghouse
Electric Corporation for the first-phase development of a multi-purpose canister (MPC) design
will be completed as scheduled, but as a result of budget reductions, OCRWM will not fund the
second (certification) and third (production) phases of MPC development.  In addition, having
completed regulatory testing of the General Atomics (GA)-4, OCRWM will discontinue funding
further development of the GA-9 and GA-4 legal-weight truck cask designs.  OCRWM will
make the technology developed under the MPC and GA contracts available to private industry
for further development.
 <p>
<strong>Interim Storage.</strong>  We plan to conduct non-site-specific work on an interim storage facility to
reduce development time if and when a storage site is identified and legislative authority
provided.  Our current planning is based upon the repository viability assessment in 1998, that in
Fiscal Year 1999, the program will receive statutory authority, sufficient funding, and a site
designation for an interim storage facility.

or call my office at (202) 586-1462.<P>

<TITLE>Letter to the Stakeholders Regarding the MPC</TITLE>
<BODY>
<NOBR><H1>Letter to Stakeholders
<br>from Dr. Daniel Dreyfus, OCRWM Director</H1></NOBR><hr>

Dear Stakeholder:
<p>
As part of the Department of Energy's (DOE) commitment to advise stakeholders of
programmatic activities, I am writing to inform you of a significant change in the Office of
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management plans for the upcoming year. The Fiscal Year 1996
appropriation significantly reduced program funding levels and necessitated that DOE
discontinue its proposal to fabricate and deploy a multi-purpose canister based system.  As a
result, DOE will cease preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a Multi-Purpose 
Canister System for Management of Civilian and Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel.
<p>
As indicated in the enclosed <a href="../resource/fedreg/navyfr.htm">Federal Register notice</a>,  the Department of the Navy (Navy) will
become the lead agency and proceed with that part of the multi-purpose canister EIS covering
naval spent nuclear fuel.   The Navy's EIS is being renamed "The Department of the Navy
Environmental Impact Statement for a Container System for the Management of Naval Spent
Nuclear Fuel." DOE will participate as a cooperating agency since DOE is responsible for the
management of spent nuclear fuel derived from atomic energy defense activities, including that
from the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. 
<p>
The Navy plans to issue the Draft EIS by April 30, 1996.  Issuance of the Draft EIS will be
announced in the Federal Register.  A 45 day comment period will be provided following
issuance of the Draft EIS.  Public hearings will be held during the 45 day comment period.  The
locations and dates of these public hearings will be announced in the Federal Register when the
Draft EIS is issued.  The Navy plans to issue the final EIS by November 30, 1996, and plans to
issue a Record of Decision by December 31, 1996.
<p>
If you would like to receive a copy of the Navy's Draft EIS when it is completed, please provide
your address to: Argonne National Laboratory, EAD, Building 900, Mail Stop 1, 9700 South
Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL 60439, ATTN: Naval Spent Fuel Container System EIS.
<p>
I hope this information has been of interest to you and I will continue to keep you abreast of
program changes in the months ahead.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
Daniel A. Dreyfus, Director
<br>

<HTML><TITLE>Multi-Purpose Canister System</TITLE>
<BODY><H2>Multi-Purpose Canister System</H2><HR>
<STRONG>In response to budgetary constraints for the civilian radioactive waste management program in fiscal year 1996, OCRWM has terminated its work on the multi-purpose canister (MPC). </STRONG><P>
<P>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, outlines a comprehensive plan for the safe disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other forms of high-level radioactive waste. The Act requires the Department of Energy to develop a system that would accept, transport and dispose of this waste. This system would consist of a permanent geologic repository, an interim storage facility, if available, and a transportation system to move the spent nuclear fuel from the reactors and storage sites to DOE facilities. <P>
<P>
Spent nuclear fuel is generated from the use of nuclear power and is very hot and highly radioactive. To date, the vast majority of spent fuel has been stored on-site at the power plants in steel-lined pools filled with water. As pools have begun to reach capacity, additional storage capacity has been added above-ground in a dry environment inside large steel or concrete containers. Nuclear utilities have been using a variety of dry storage technologies that incorporate similar systems; however, these systems will likely require repackaging prior to transport and disposal. <P>

<H3>The Concept </H3>

Over the years, the Department of Energy has considered several different container systems. A container may serve only one purpose - for storage, transport or disposal; it may serve two purposes - for storage and transport; or it may serve three purposes - storage, transport and disposal. In early 1994, after extensive evaluation and interactions with stakeholders, the decision was made to pursue the development of a canister-based system, known as the multi-purpose canister or MPC. The MPC system was envisioned for use for all stages of the waste management system, and would allow the bare spent fuel to be handled only once for its initial packaging and never require repackaging.<p>
<P>
The multi-purpose canister would have been made of steel and other materials that limit the radiation dose to workers and the public. Inside the canister is a metal frame used to support the spent nuclear fuel assemblies, transfer heat to the outer surface, prevent nuclear criticality, and add strength to the canister. The MPC would have two lids for added strength and protection. Once spent nuclear fuel assemblies were loaded into the MPC, it would be sealed and not reopened. The canister could then be placed inside separate casks for storage, transportation and disposal. The MPC could be used for above-ground storage at either the nuclear power plant or an interim storage facility. <P>
<p>
<img src="pc0673.jpg" align="middle">
<p>
<em>Once loaded with spent nuclear fuel assemblies, an MPC will be sealed and loaded into a cask
for each phase of storage, transport or disposal.
</em>

<P>

<H3>The Design</H3> 

The MPC was designed to contain spent nuclear fuel from the two primary types of U.S. commercial reactors - boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors. Two sizes of MPC (125 tons and 75 tons) were also designed so that the MPC would be compatible with the majority of nuclear reactor sites. The weight includes the canister, spent nuclear fuel and the transportation cask. The two sizes of MPC could be used at plants with a licensed crane capacity of at least 125 tons and 75 tons, respectively. <P>
<P>
Because of the weight involved in transport, the MPC was intended for rail shipment. By using a large canister, more spent nuclear fuel could be loaded, thereby reducing the number of shipments and the possibility of transportation accidents. <P>

<H3>Environmental Consequences for Alternatives </H3>

Fabrication and deployment of a canister-based system required the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to be used in making an informed decision concerning the use of MPCs in the waste management system. The MPC EIS was to focus on comparing the environmental impacts of alternative canister systems, including single purpose, dual purpose, and multi-purpose systems. However, due to budgetary constraints for the program in fiscal year 1996, preparation of the MPC EIS was terminated. The Department of the Navy has assumed lead responsibility for preparation of a container system EIS for naval spent nuclear fuel with DOE serving as a cooperating agency.  This EIS, titled "Department of the Navy Final Environmental Impact Statement for a Container System for Management of Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel" was issued in November, 1996. <P>

<H3>Current Status and Further Considerations</H3>

In FY 1996, OCRWM decided to abandon some of its technology development activities related to spent fuel storage and transport, and to seek services and equipment for these activities from private sector sources.  Consistent with this approach, OCRWM chose not to pursue development of the MPC system beyond the initial design stage.<P>
<P>
Westinghouse, the company selected by DOE to design the MPC system, completed preliminary design and safety analysis reports in September 1996.  The Department of Energy believes that the information gained in designing the MPC components will be of value to the nuclear industry. DOE is making all information pertinent to the MPC system available to the private sector.<P>

<TITLE>Storage And Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H2>Storage And Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel</H2><HR>
In 1982, Congress enacted the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and as amended in 1987, outlined a comprehensive plan for the management and safe disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other forms of high-level radioactive waste. The Department of Energy, through its Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, was given the responsibility for planning, constructing, and operating such a disposal system. <P>
<P>
Nuclear power plants safely store radioactive materials using a variety of proven technologies. Such storage, particularly for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, must protect those who work and live nearby from radiation. Until a permanent geologic repository is in operation, spent nuclear fuel will continue to be stored in specially designed water filled pools and above-ground dry storage facilities. <P>

<H3>What Is Being Stored? </H3>

To produce electricity using nuclear fission, which converts mass to energy, nuclear power plants use solid, ceramic-like pellets of enriched uranium, slightly larger than pencil erasers, stacked atop each other and sealed in strong metal tubes, called fuel rods. The rods are 3.5-4.5 meters (12-15 feet) long, and are bundled together in groups of about 200 to form nuclear fuel assemblies. These fuel assemblies, when placed inside a nuclear reactor where the fission process takes place, produce heat that is used to generate steam and make electricity.<P>
<P>
After three or four years in an operating nuclear reactor, the energy remaining inside the pellets is no longer efficient enough to produce usable heat. Used, or "spent" nuclear fuel assemblies are removed from the reactor and replaced with fresh fuel. The spent nuclear fuel assemblies have become highly radioactive during the fission process and must be isolated from the environment for long periods of time. It takes thousands of years for the radiation to naturally decrease to the acceptable levels already found in nature. <P>

<H3>Current Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage</H3>

Each nuclear power plant has facilities on site to temporarily store spent nuclear fuel as it comes out of the reactor. Although the spent nuclear fuel is highly radioactive, there are relatively low volumes of it at each site. Most fuel is placed in large pools of water contained in steel-lined concrete basins. Besides helping to cool the spent nuclear fuel, water provides protection from radiation for plant workers and the public. <P>
<P>
Other methods of storing spent nuclear fuel at the reactor site do not involve water. Spent nuclear fuel assemblies can be stored in a "dry" environment above-ground using heavy containers or casks made of steel and/or concrete. Casks are either placed upright on concrete pads, or stored horizontally in metal canisters in concrete bunkers. Like pool storage, dry storage has been proven safe but is not intended to be a permanent solution.<P>

<H3>Interim Storage Options/Plans For The Future</H3>

As a step toward final disposal, the Department of Energy is ready to respond to policy redirection related to interim storage. An interim storage facility could serve as a collection point for temporarily storing some of the nation's spent nuclear fuel until a permanent repository is built. (Congressional legislation was considered in July 1996 designating an interim storage site at the Nevada Test Site.  The proposed bill was passed by the Senate by a vote of 63-37, but was not voted on in the House of Representatives) <P>

Another option that the Department of Energy had explored was a special container-based system known as a <A HREF="/pages/resource/facts/mpcfct.htm">multi-purpose canister</A> or an MPC.  The MPC concept built upon storage technologies already in operation and demonstrated to be safe, and would have allowed for spent nuclear fuel to be handled only once prior to storage, transportation, and disposal. (In response to budgetary constraints for the civilian radioactive waste management program in fiscal year 1996, OCRWM did not pursue development of an MPC system beyond the initial design stage.) <P>

<H3>Permanent Solutions </H3>
Many options have been studied to determine the best environment for isolating radiation over long periods of time. For instance, leaving the waste at the reactor site, burying it in the ocean floor, putting it in polar ice sheets, and rocketing it into outer space were all considered. Most scientific organizations, including the National Academy of Sciences and U.S. Geological Survey, have recommended underground geologic disposal as the permanent solution. <P>
<P>
In the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, Congress directed the Department of Energy to concentrate site characterization studies at <A HREF="http://www.ymp.gov/">Yucca Mountain, Nevada</A>. Yucca Mountain is in an arid climate about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. The proposed depth of the repository is about 300 meters (1,000 feet) below the surface, but still about 240 meters (800 feet) above the water table in a very hard rock called volcanic tuff. Scientists are studying the mountain and its structure by examining the geology at the surface, removing core and water samples by drilling deep into the mountain, digging trenches, and studying sound waves as they move through the rock. Tunneling into Yucca Mountain is being conducted in order to construct an Exploratory Studies Facility, where scientists can get a better understanding of the characteristics of the rock inside the mountain. <P>
<P>
The process of site characterization is very detailed and will require many years of research, testing and evaluation. The current schedule in the OCRWM program shows that a viability assessment of Yucca Mountain will be prepared by 1998, and the repository will start operations in 2010. If at any time DOE or the teams of scientists discover the site to be unsuitable, they will stop characterization activity, restore the area, and report to Congress within six months on a recommended course of action. <P>

<html><hr><head><h2>Transportation of Spent Nuclear Fuel</h2><head>
<hr><p>
<body>A safe, dependable transportation system is a crucial link in both the operation of any proposed
interim storage facility and a permanent geologic repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to accept,
transport, and dispose of spent nuclear fuel.
<p>
Over the last 25 years, approximately 2,500 shipments of spent nuclear fuel have been
transported safely over America's highways, waterways, and railroads. During this time, an
exemplary safety record has been established with no fatalities, injuries, or environmental
damage caused by the radioactive nature of the cargo.
<p>
Several factors have contributed to this success story. The spent nuclear fuel is a solid, ceramic-like material enclosed in metal tubes and shipped dry in rugged containers. These containers are
heavy, sealed, thick-walled, steel structures that safely confine the spent nuclear fuel. These
specially engineered containers are designed to keep their radioactive cargo from being released
into the environment under both normal and off-normal conditions.
<p>
<strong>Testing To Ensure Safety</strong>
<p>
Each shipping container is designed to maintain its integrity under normal transportation
conditions and during hypothetical accident conditions. The containers must provide protection
against radiological release to the environment. The following tests are administered in sequence
and include:<br>
<ul>
<li>          A 9 meter (30-foot) free fall on to an unyielding surface 
<li>          A puncture test allowing the container to free-fall 1 meter (40 inches) onto a steel rod 15  centimeters (6 inches) in diameter 
<li>          A 30-minute, all-engulfing fire at 800 degrees Celsius (1475 degrees Fahrenheit) 
<li>          An 8-hour immersion under 0.9 meter (3 feet) of water. 
</ul><p>
In addition, the undamaged package must be subjected to a one-hour immersion under 200
meters (655 feet) of water.
<p>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is responsible for certification of the package design. The Department of
Transportation (DOT) has established regulations for handling shipping containers, labeling
containers and placarding transport vehicles for identification purposes, driver training and
certification; and highway routing.
<p>
<p>

<p>
<em>Truck-Mounted Spent Fuel Shipping Cask </em>
<p><p>
<img src="oa09003.jpg align="middle"> 
<p>
<em>Train Carrying Spent Fuel Shipping Casks </em><p>
<strong>What If An Accident Occurs?</strong>
<p>
Radioactive waste transport is controlled by a comprehensive regulatory framework and has an
excellent safety record.  Because there is a chance that an accident involving a radioactive
shipment could occur, emergency response plans will be in place to handle any situation that
could arise. The key to effective emergency response is quality training and preparation.  The
DOE will provide technical and financial assistance for training public safety officials through
whose jurisdictions the Department transports spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
waste.
<p>
Routing is an important issue because it is related to a variety of OCRWM activities including
advance notification, emergency response preparedness, inspection and enforcement, and risk
management. Until such time as a Federal receiving facility is designated pursuant to existing or
future legislation, specific routes and number of shipments cannot be determined. Once
shipments of spent nuclear fuel begin, the Department of Energy will follow existing DOT
regulations which generally limit shipments to either the interstate highway systems, a state-designated alternative route, or both.  Rail shipments will be routed using current rail and motor carrier practices. 
<p>
As the Department develops the Federal waste management system, it is committed to providing
safe shipments of spent nuclear fuel across the nation's highways and railroads.

<img src="s1-996.jpg">        <!--oa14145-->
<B>Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) Photo/Mapping Gantry.</B><P>
This photo is a view of the TBM taken from the photo/mapping gantry and may look much like some you have seen before, but it shows the machine leaving the main drift and entering the turn into the ramp to the south portal where it will exit the mountain.  This progress signifies a shift in emphasis from excavating the main drift to conducting scientific experiments in the tunnel and in the alcoves.
<p><HR><p>

<img src="s2-996.jpg">       <!--oa13292-->
<B>Testing in the Thermomechanical Alcove</B><P> 
Here is a view of the heater test array in the Thermomechanical Alcove.  The single heater test, which began on August 26th, will give us information on thermal effects and experience with the instruments prior to our larger, multi-element drift scale heater tests.  In the center of this picture you can see the hole where the heater element has been emplaced.  You can also see the array of instruments that will measure the effect of heat on the rock and effect of heat on moisture within the rock. 
<p><HR><p>

<img src="s3-996.jpg">  <!--oa14151-->
<B>Installation of Heater Assembly</B><P>
This is a photo of the heater element being emplaced in the borehole that is surrounded by the instrument array.  The heater is 5 meters long, will output about 4 kW and will heat the rock in the vicinty of the heater to about 300&#176; C. 
<p><HR><p>

<img src="s4-996.jpg">  <!--oa14141-->
<B>Escavation of North Ghost Dance Fault Alcove</B><P>
This photo shows the construction of the Northern Ghost Dance Fault Alcove.  Excavation has been completed to the planned length of 90 meters.  Because we are unsure as the location of the fault, we will drill a discovery borehole into the face of the alcove to locate the fault.  If we do not find the fault, the alcove will be further excavated, and another discovery borehole will be drilled.  Once the fault is located, we will drill a number of boreholes through the fault to test the relatively undisturbed physical and hydrologic characteristics of the fault.  Then, we will excavate the alcove through the fault zone to provide for direct observation and testing.
<p><HR><p>

<img src="s5-996.jpg">  <!--oa13290-->
<B>Moisture Measurements in Thermomechanical Alcove</B> <P>
Here you see a technician measuring moisture in the Thermomechanical Alcove.  We are obtaining data on the level of water content in the rock prior to the heater tests.  These tests will also provide an opportunity to test the instruments before the larger and more complex drift scale tests are conducted.
<p><HR><p>

<img src="s6-996.jpg">  <!--oa13289-->
<B>Rock Stability Measurements Near the Thermomechanical Alcove</B>.<P>
This photo shows two technicians measuring the dimensions of the opening near the entrance to the Thermomechanical Testing Alcove to check mechanical stability.  The thermal effects on rock stability are important to design and repository operations.<P><HR>

 <TITLE>Transportation and Emergency Response Training Policy and Procedures </TITLE>
<BODY>

<NOBR><h2>Release of Proposed Policy and Procedures <br>
for the Safe Transportation of Spent Nuclear Fuel<br>
and Emergency Response Training</h2></NOBR>
<hr>

DOE has published in the <A HREF="http://www.rw.doe.gov/pages/resource/fedreg/180c.htm">Federal Register</A>, a proposed policy statement to implement a program of technical and financial assistance to states for training local and tribal government public safety officials. The officials eligible for the funding and technical assistance are from the states and Indian tribal lands through which the department plans to transport spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste. The training would cover both safe routine transportation procedures and emergency response procedures. <P>
<P>
The public comment period on the proposed policy closed September 30, 1996.  The Department received 38 comments from various states, Indian tribes, county governments, professional organziations and other interested parties.  The Department will consider these comments during development of the final policy and procedures.  The final policy and procedures will be published in the Federal Register in June 1997. <P>

<HTML><TITLE> DOE Proposes New Approach for Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Services</TITLE> 
<BODY><H1>DOE Proposes New Approach for Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Services</H1>
<HR>
OCRWM is developing an approach for the performance of its waste acceptance, storage, and transportation responsibilities as set forth in the 
<A HREF="http://www.rw.doe.gov/pages/resource/nwpa/nwpa.htm">Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), as amended</A>, and in the Standard Contract.  A presolicitation conference was held on July 9, 1996, to discuss technical and contractual issues related to the potential acquisition of transportation services.  At the presolicitation conference, OCRWM made available a 
draft Statement of Work and a 
draft Concept of Operations for the waste acceptance and transportation services acquisition.  The Department anticipates that a <A HREF="/waste/rfp/rfp-cp.htm">draft request for proposals (RFP)</A> should be issued for public review and comment in December 1996, followed by another presolicitation conference in the February/March time frame.  The draft RFP and the presolicitation conferences are preliminary steps taken to support the release of a final RFP in a timely manner.<P>
<P>
OCRWM is pursuing an acquisition process that is market driven, relying on private industry (contractors) to provide all necessary services and equipment required to fulfill OCRWM's mission at competitive, fixed prices and fixed rates.  The contractors would accept spent fuel from its owners and generators (Purchasers) and supply casks and equipment for transporting spent fuel to (and possibly storage at) a designated Federal facility.  Contractors would work with Purchasers to determine the best way to service a site and would recommend to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission preferred transportation routes to a Federal facility.  <P>
<P>
OCRWM may award up to four contracts, covering four regions of the United States.  The intent is to develop a market infrastructure to foster competition and innovative approaches to waste acceptance and transportation. The phased approach to contract implementation would allow flexibility and would include sequential development of business/servicing plans that would describe each contractor's general approach, how it might acquire casks and equipment, and its approach to transportation operations.</HTML></BODY>

<html><TITLE>Multi-Year Program Plan News Release</TITLE>
<BODY>
<NOBR><h2>  Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program <br>
		 Releases Multi-Year Program Plan</h2></NOBR>
<hr>

<pre>NEWS MEDIA CONTACT:                                     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Joanne L. Johnson, 202/586-5806                         June 12, 1996</pre>
<p>
     A <A HREF="http://www.rw.doe.gov/pages/intro/planltr.htm">draft Program Plan</A> for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive
Waste Management (OCRWM) is being released today. This revised Program Plan has been
prepared to implement the administration's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request and the direction of
Congress in the Fiscal Year 1996 Appropriation's legislation. The Department of Energy
recognizes that the plan is based on assumptions that may have to be updated and modified, as
appropriate.
<p>
     The plan is consistent with the administration's position on high-level radioactive waste
management, in that geologic disposal remains the basic goal. The administration strongly
believes that the siting of any interim storage facility must be based upon objective criteria and
that such a decision should be informed by the scientific work necessary to determine the
viability of the proposed Yucca Mountain repository. Prior to the completion of that work the
activities in the plan related to interim storage are limited to non-site specific design and
engineering and the preparation for transportation.
<p>
     Improvements in integration and efficiency have enabled the program to adapt to a sharp
reduction of program funding while preserving the core scientific programs at Yucca Mountain
and to develop and propose a course of action that has the potential to regain the objective of
repository licensing within a reasonable time frame.
<p>
     Since the <em>1994 Program Plan</em> was initiated, a great deal of progress has been made in the
scientific evaluation and understanding of the specific attributes of the Yucca Mountain site.
Since 1993, the project has excavated over three-and-a-half miles of tunnel and four testing
alcoves; drilled seven deep and 19 shallow boreholes; and excavated 13 trenches for geologic
investigations. Analysis of the data collected over the past 20 years, and in particular the last
several years, has confirmed many of the hypotheses that will be relied upon for a site suitability
determination and a license application for the repository.
<p>
     Key elements of the new program direction for the Yucca Mountain Project include:
<p><ul>
<li><em> Updating the regulatory framework for a repository at Yucca Mountain in 1997 -- </em>the
     program will propose amendments to the Department of Energy's siting guidelines that
     will lead to a more efficient process for suitability determination.
<p>
<li>     <em>Completing the viability assessment of the Yucca Mountain Repository Site in 1998 --</em> the
     program will address the major unresolved technical questions so that an informed
     assessment can be made of the viability of licensing and constructing a geologic
     repository at Yucca Mountain. The assessment will include critical repository design
     elements, a total system performance assessment, a plan and cost estimate for remaining
     work required for a license application, and a cost estimate to construct and operate the
     repository.
<p>
 <li>    <em>Recommending a repository site to the President in 2001 and submitting a repository
     license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002-- </em>the program's
     strategy is to concentrate on the factors significant to the performance of a repository at
     Yucca Mountain. After completion of the viability assessment, the program will prepare
     the additional information necessary for the Secretary of Energy's site recommendation to
     the President and license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<p>
     OCRWM will also focus some resources on activities designed to ensure that waste
acceptance can begin as soon as policy and technical developments allow. A waste acceptance
and transportation strategy is being developed that will rely on private sector implementation. An
acquisition strategy for equipment and services will be developed and industry and vendor views
solicited.
<p>
     To obtain a copy of the revised plan, please contact the Civilian Radioactive Waste
Information Center at 1-800-225-6972, or access it through the OCRWM Home Page on the
Internet at http://www.rw.doe.gov.

<head><h2>
Civilian High-Level Radioactive Waste Management:</h2>
</head>
<hr>
<body>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Stewardship</strong>
<dd>The Nuclear Waste Policy Act obligates the Federal government to accept stewardship for our Nation's spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  The long-term management and disposal of these materials is the mission of the Office of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.  It is one of the most profound responsibilities of the Department of Energy.
<p>
<dt><strong>Environmental</strong>    
<dd>Geologic disposal is the path forward for the clean-up of defense sites and isolation of other nuclear wastes.  In the absence of a viable approach to disposal, the clean-up of nuclear weapons sites and the decommissioning of nuclear power plants translates into the perpetual management of hazardous sites for generations to come.
<p>
<dt><strong>Non-Proliferation</strong>   
<dd>President Clinton has reaffirmed the national policy of discouraging reprocessing of commercial spent fuel and the international trade in plutonium as a commercial energy source to reduce proliferation risk.
<p>
<dt><strong>International</strong> 
<dd>There is fundamental consensus among nuclear nations that deep geologic disposal is the preferred option for high-level nuclear waste.  The U.S. example in pursuing the geologic disposal strategy underwrites our international policy stance.
<p>
<dt><strong>Energy </strong>  
<dd>Spent nuclear fuel is currently stored on-site at 119 operating and shut-down reactors at 73 reactor sites in 34 states. Confidence in the ultimate removal of spent fuel is critical to public support for the optimal utilization of the existing generating capacity that serves 20% of the nation's electric energy.
<p>
<dt><strong>Equity </strong>                  
<dd>Existing law intends that the full costs of spent fuel disposal are borne by the beneficiaries of nuclear-generated electricity, and, in turn, that the Federal government will fulfill its obligation to accept the spent fuel resulting from the once-through fuel cycle.
</dl>
<p>
<strong>TWO BUSINESS CENTERS:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Our program is organized around two projects or "business centers," the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project and the Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation Project.
<p>
<li>The program management component provides integration, planning, and administrative support to the Director and the projects.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>PROGRESS AT YUCCA MOUNTAIN:</strong>
<p>
At Yucca Mountain:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Over the past 3 years, drawing upon scientific studies done at the site since the 1970s, we have substantially increased the scientific and technical confidence in the suitability of the proposed repository site.
<p>
<li>Since September 1994, we have completed over one-half of the planned 5-mile Exploratory Tunnel, and are now over 50 percent ahead of schedule.  The tunnel is now well into the proposed repository horizon, and provides direct access to major geologic features.
<p>
<li> Tunneling and in-situ testing are confirming expectations.  Thus far, we have found no unexpected geologic conditions that refute the important hypotheses that we will be relying upon to provide assurance of the safety of a repository.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>PROGRESS IN WASTE ACCEPTANCE, STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION:</strong>
<p>
<ul>
<li>We have also made substantial progress in the advancement of technologies for waste acceptance, transportation and storage.
<p>
<li> We completed the fabrication of a half-scale, high-capacity, truck cask shown here undergoing a successful droptest.
<p>
<li>We awarded a contract for the design and certification of the first multi-purpose canister (MPC) system in April of 1995.
<p>
<li>We submitted a formal report on burn-up credit to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for review.  Approval of the burn-up credit methodology will substantially reduce the cost of future transport and storage technologies.
<p>
<li>We initiated the process to establish training programs for public safety officials along proposed transportation routes.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>PROGRESS IN PROGRAM MANAGEMENT:</strong>
<p>
Since 1993:
<p>
<ul>
<li>We have developed a strategic plan to converge the program activities on the key objectives:<p>
     -    an early decision on the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site; and<br>
     -    the necessary capability to accept and transport waste.
<p>
<li>We have consolidated all program participants under the M&O contractor for integration and management efficiency.
<p>
<li>We have reorganized the program around two major business centers.
<p>
<li>We have improved management systems for the effective use of reduced resources.
<p>
<li>As a consequence of our planning and management improvements, we have been able to respond to budget reductions with a new plan that can preserve the major objectives of the program despite a greatly reduced level of funding, and with 1000 fewer contractor positions.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>BUDGET DISTRIBUTION COMPARISON:</strong>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Based upon strategic planning, in 1994 we proposed a new Program Approach to meet the policy goals set by Congress in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  In Fiscal Year 1995, the Congress provided $522 million for that initiative.
<p>
<li>The Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation did not, however, fund continuation of that program plan.  It provided only $400 million for the program and further reserved $85 million of that amount.  We have adjusted the program plan to maintain momentum toward key program objectives while recognizing the realities of the deficit reduction era.
<p>
<li> The overall Fiscal Year 1997 budget request for the program is $400 million, of which $200 million is derived from the Nuclear Waste Fund and $200 million is the contribution for the Defense share of program costs. Fully 85% of the funding would support work at Yucca Mountain. 
<p>
<li>  As a result of our planning and management improvements, we have been able to develop a
program that can regain the objectives of the Yucca Mountain Project with this level of funding.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>SOURCE OF FUNDS:</strong>
<p>
<ul>
<li>We are proposing that of the $400 million, $200 million will be derived from the Nuclear Waste Fund, and $200 million will be a contribution for the Defense share of program costs.<p>
     -    The Nuclear Waste Fund is financed by fees from the ratepayers of nuclear utilities.<br>
     -    The defense contribution is a General Fund appropriation to offset the costs of disposing of the Department's high-level waste from the nuclear weapons program.<br>
<p>
<li>This budget request is intended to be discretionary funding, entirely under the budget caps.
<p>
<li>No other legislative action is required to support the appropriation.
<p>
</ul>
<strong>RETURN ON INVESTMENT:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This Fiscal Year 1997 budget request, coupled with aggressive management, will enable the program by 1998 to resolve the remaining significant questions concerning the viability of the Yucca Mountain repository.
<p>
<li>The target date of 2002 for a repository license application will be regained, founded upon an updated regulatory framework.
<p>
<li>Our strategies will be refined and our capability enhanced to respond quickly when the Administration and Congress agree upon a policy for interim storage.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT - $339M:</strong>
<p>
During Fiscal Year 1997:
<p>
<ul>
<li>We will complete excavation of the 5-mile Exploratory Tunnel and the construction of all major underground test alcoves.
<p>
<li>We will initiate heater tests in the repository rock to simulate heat generated by spent fuel waste packages and to allow us to study the structural and hydrologic response.
<p>
<li>We will penetrate the Ghost Dance Fault, a major geologic feature of the repository setting, first by drilling and then by tunneling. Hydrologic testing in the fault will address major questions of water movement in the mountain.
<p>
<li>We will advance the detailed designs on critical engineered waste isolation features to support the next total system performance assessment scheduled for completion during 1997.
<p>
<li>Meanwhile, we will revise the Department's repository siting guidelines to support the new plan leading to a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002 for a construction permit.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>WASTE ACCEPTANCE, STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION - $10M:</strong>
<p>
<ul>
<li>As a consequence of  the Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation, we cannot continue development of a multi-purpose canister (MPC) system.  We believe that the approach is sound, and private industry may elect to carry the design forward. The work on  legal-weight truck casks also will be phased out in an orderly manner. 
<p>
<li>The Fiscal Year 1997 budget request will support our legal oversight responsibilities concerning commercial spent fuel and we will conduct contingency planning for transportation and interim storage.
<p>
<li>We will examine a market-driven approach that relies on the private sector to develop that transportation capability.  Performance-based procurements would be used to obtain needed waste acquisition and shipping services at a fair
price.  Private vendors would arrange to collect spent fuel from utility sites and deliver it to a Federal facility.
<p>
<li>We also intend to engage the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in pre-licensing discussions on a non-site-specific basis that can address the procedural aspects of licensing a phased interim storage facility.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>PROGRAM MANAGEMENT - $50.7M:</strong>

<HTML><TITLE>FY 1997 Appropriation Supports Revised Program Plan</TITLE>
<HEAD><H2>FY 1997 Appropriation Supports Revised Program Plan</H2></HEAD><HR>
<BODY><P>
On October 1, the President signed the fiscal year 1997 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, providing $382 million for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM). The President's support and Congress' passage of the Appropriations Act allow OCRWM to proceed with the implementation of its Draft Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan, Revision 1, released in June 1996, which supersedes the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan, dated December 19, 1994. The Plan was published in draft because OCRWM recognizes that it is based on assumptions that may have to be updated and modified, as appropriate.<P>
<P>
The strategy outlined in the revised Plan requires that activities be prioritized to enable OCRWM to assess, by September 30, 1998, the viability of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as a site for a deep geologic repository. Upon completion of the Yucca Mountain site viability assessment, implementation of this revised Program Plan would allow the program to proceed toward a formal application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a permit to begin constructing a repository in 2002. Emplacement of nuclear waste would commence in 2010.<P>
<P>
The ability to focus on the most critical scientific and technical questions at the Yucca Mountain site is based on more than a decade of scientific work at the site, which includes extensive surface-based and underground exploration. The approach outlined in the revised Plan will enable the Program to reach a license application for about $1 billion dollars less than the previous Program Plan required.<P>
<P>
With regard to the issue of <A HREF="/pages/resource/facts/storfct.htm">interim storage</A> of commercial and naval reactor spent nuclear fuel, the Administration strongly believes that any siting decision for such a facility must be based on objective science-based criteria, and that such a decision should not be made prior to the completion of the scientific work necessary to determine the viability of the potential repository site at Yucca Mountain. The Administration also believes that, prior to the completion of this scientific and technical work, any activities related to the development of an interim nuclear waste storage facility should be limited to non-site specific design and engineering activities. <P>
<P>

<img  Alt="[Chart Comparing Key Objectives Between 1994 Program Plan and Draft Program Plan, Revision 1] " src="keyobjct.gif " Align=right height=683 width=439>


The <A HREF="/pages/current/ancmnt.htm">revised program strategy</A> includes a market-driven approach that relies on the private sector for transportation, storage, and waste acceptance services. The approach will allow for the maximum use of private industry capabilities, expertise, and experience in accepting, transporting, and storing commercial spent nuclear fuel. OCRWM plans to develop and implement a competitive procurement process resulting in awards of fixed-price, multi-year, performance-based contracts to obtain needed services and equipment at a reasonable cost. Incentives and flexibility will be offered to encourage innovative private sector approaches. Under this approach, private industry will act for the Department in carrying out certain functions under the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR Part 961) to accept spent nuclear fuel at utility sites for delivery to a Federal facility.<P>
<P>
The revised strategy also restructures program management activities consistent with a reduced funding level and the Program's refocused priorities. OCRWM's Management Center will provide continued program management and administration support, as well as assistance to the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project and Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project as the revised Program Plan is implemented. It will address the crosscutting issues affecting both business centers, and support the Director's office in the overall management and representation of the Program and in the development of program policies and strategies. Efforts will concentrate on improving and updating management systems to ensure the efficient application of scarce resources to program priorities. Emphasis will also be placed on enhancing the ability of the Federal staff to carry out its management responsibilities with reduced contractor support.<P>
<P>
The revised Program Plan is intended to ensure that the momentum that has been achieved by OCRWM will be maintained and enhanced in the years ahead. OCRWM recognizes, however, that the assumptions underlying the revised Plan may prove to be invalid. Should this occur, the revised Program Plan will be modified.<P>
<P>
To receive a copy of the <A HREF="/pages/intro/planltr.htm">draft Program Plan</A>, please call 1-800-225-6972 (202-488-6720 in Washington, D.C.) or write to the OCRWM National Information Center at 600 Maryland Avenue, SW, Suite 695, Washington, D.C. 20024. <P>

<HTML><TITLE>Site Characterization Progress at Yucca Mountain</TITLE>

<H2><HEAD>Site Characterization Progress at Yucca Mountain</HEAD></H2>
<BODY>
<HR>
Scientists have made a great deal of progress in their investigation of Yucca Mountain, Nevada. They have studied the data from extensive scientific and analytical work performed since site characterization began, and have confirmed various early hypotheses about the mountain. In the process, they have also reduced some scientific and technical uncertainties about its potential performance as a repository site. 
<P>

<img  Alt="[Photograph: Project personnel inspecting instrumentation for designed to help them learn what they neef to know about seismic forces at work near Yucca Mountain] " src="yccasit2.jpg "Align=right height=420 width=291>

An important milestone in this effort has been the completion of the third in a series of total system performance assessments. This is an analytical technique that uses computer models to evaluate the ability of a repository and its engineered and geologic systems to safely contain and isolate radioactive waste. <P>

Scientists and engineers are using the insights produced by this assessment to refine their waste containment and isolation strategy. This strategy will help focus future scientific and engineering efforts on important technical issues that still need to be resolved. Outstanding issues concern long-term behavior of the natural geologic system, as well as features and processes of the natural geologic and hydrologic system that might impact the engineered systems currently being designed for the repository. 
<P>


While some tests will continue for a number of years, for the viability assessment due in 1998, engineers and scientists will perform work designed to further confirm the hypotheses underlying their waste isolation strategy.<P>

<H3>Exploratory Tunnel Adds to Earlier Efforts</H3>

Scientists developed their earliest picture of conditions at Yucca Mountain from surface-based tests and observations dating as far back as the late 1970s. These included drilling efforts and seismic testing. This understanding has been complemented by recently completed subsurface excavation. During the last year, the rapid progress of the tunnel boring machine has advanced excavation of the exploratory tunnel through the proposed repository level. This has provided confirmation of many early assumptions about conditions at the site. <P>

Among some of the important scientific results that have emerged:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Observations of the natural system and data collected since 1978 suggest that the natural system is robust, which is to say that the geological characteristics of the site appear to be complementary   can work together in their ability to isolate waste. <P>

<LI>Numerical models and calculations will be able to bound, or set limits upon, many of the uncertainties for radiological safety evaluations. This leads to greater confidence in predicting how the site will respond once the repository is built.<P>

<LI>Recent performance assessments provide confidence that a Yucca Mountain repository would contain and isolate radioactive waste, and would assure public health and safety.<P>

<LI>Geologic evidence is consistent with models of the site that have been the basis of performance calculations for more than 10 years. However, scientists still must determine the long-term importance of potential fast pathways for water movement. <P>

<LI>Very recent work has challenged the extent of the potential for the lateral diversion of infiltration. This new, preliminary information is being evaluated. Ongoing exploration and planned testing will help determine the extent to which infiltration may be expected to be diverted near the surface of Yucca Mountain.<P>

<LI>The rock quality at the potential repository level is as good or better than assumed when scientists first considered a repository at Yucca Mountain that could safely dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.<P>

<LI>The potential repository area is also as dry as expected.<P>

<LI>The probability of a future volcanic eruption directly intersecting a repository at Yucca Mountain is now estimated to be about 1 in 70,000,000 per year.</UL>


<H3>Next 2 Years Will Continue To Focus on Vital Science Activities</H3>

Scientific activities during the next 2 years will focus on the scientific and technical questions about waste containment and isolation that remain to be resolved. In particular, scientists will address:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The rate of water seepage into the proposed repository level <P>

<LI>The integrity of waste packages <P>

<LI>The rate of release of radionuclides from waste in waste packages that have been penetrated by water <P>

<LI>Radionuclide movement through the repository's engineered and natural barriers<P>

<LI>The rate and manner in which radionuclides from waste packages dissolve in the ground water at the repository level.
</UL>

<H3>Refining Mathematical Models of Repository Performance</H3>

In addition, scientific activity during this period will address the development of mathematical and conceptual models describing the performance of the potential repository. Toward this end, scientists will:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Test and model groundwater flow above the water table, to better understand the behavior of 
water in the unsaturated rock where a repository would be located<P>

<LI>Test and model groundwater flow, to better understand the movement of water below the water table<P>

<LI>Refine radionuclide movement models, to integrate or combine what is known about the flow of water, the effects of waste-generated heat, and the geology of Yucca Mountain<P>

<LI>Develop supportable values, or numbers, for releases of different radionuclides over time from the repository's engineered barriers<P>

<LI>Complete the description of the geology of Yucca Mountain, as well as assessments of volcanic and seismic hazards to a repository built there<P>

<LI>Continue refining mathematical models predicting future climatic conditions at Yucca Mountain<P>

<LI>Conduct tests to establish the effects of waste-generated heat upon the rock and water in a repository. These data will support coupled-process models of the waste package environment an
d the rock affected by the waste-generated heat. The first of these tests began August 26, 1996.<P>

<TITLE>From the Director</TITLE>
<H2><HEAD>From the Director</HEAD></H2>
<HR>

<BODY>
<P>
Dear Reader:<P>
<P>
The cover story in the last issue of the OCRWM Bulletin announced that OCRWM had received
only half its fiscal year 1996 budget request. Despite the major reduction in resources, I am
pleased to report that management improvements and programmatic efficiencies initiated under
our original Program Plan, and continued and enhanced under our recently revised Program Plan,
have enabled us to make significant progress in advancing our mission of managing and
disposing of the Nation's spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.<P>
<P>
The fiscal year 1997 Congressional appropriation supports the approach outlined in our revised
plan <a href="01entprs.htm">(see related article)</a>. The appropriated $382 million will allow us to complete
the 5-mile exploratory tunnel and the construction of all major underground test alcoves in FY
1997. We will continue to narrow the range of unresolved scientific and engineering issues. The
direction we are taking will, by 1998, enable us to complete a viability assessment of the Yucca
Mountain site. With continued adequate funding and an updated regulatory process, we can
regain a target date of 2002 for the submittal of a competent license application to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.<P>
<P>
In accordance with the Secretary's objectives for re-engineering the Department and greater
privatization, and consistent with the direction of the policy debate taking place in the Congress,
we have also revised our program approach for waste acceptance, storage, and transportation
activities. We will place greater reliance upon the marketplace and utilize appropriately
structured contractual arrangements to acquire the needed technologies and the logistical
capability to carry out these responsibilities. (For more information on these activities, see Pre-solicitation Conference for Acquisition of Transportation Services Held in Washington and
Working Group Meets to Discuss Transportation Issues in this issue.)<P>
<P>
We continue to carry out contingency planning to address the challenges inherent in the
transportation and interim storage of commercial spent nuclear fuel. As the funding levels for
future years are defined, and as Congress provides new policy direction, we will further refine the
Program. <P>
<P>
Ours is a challenging and exciting enterprise. Thus, we have renamed our newsletter The
OCRWM Enterprise to reflect the difficult, risky, and complex nature of our program. I hope that
you will find our newly designed semiannual newsletter to be useful and informative.<P>

<TITLE>Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board Praises Progress at Yucca Mountain<P></TITLE>
<H2><HEAD>Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board Praises Progress at Yucca Mountain<P></HEAD></H2>
<HR>

<BODY>
The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board (the Board), an organization created by Congress to
provide technical and scientific evaluation of activities undertaken by the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), issued two reports on the OCRWM Program earlier
this year, entitled the <cite>Report to the U.S. Congress and the Secretary of Energy &#150 1995 Findings
and Recommendations</cite> (April 1996) and <cite>Disposal and Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel &#150 Finding
the Right Balance </cite>(March 1996).<P>
<P>
In its April report, the Board stated that OCRWM has made significant progress in a number of
areas despite the budgetary, programmatic, and regulatory uncertainties facing the Program. The
report praised OCRWM for greatly increasing efficiency of underground tunnel operations at the
Yucca Mountain site, obtaining essential data about the character and hydrology of the rock at
the proposed repository level, beginning to formulate a clear and technically defensible waste
isolation strategy, and improving the Program's focus and effectiveness.<P>
<P>
The April report also included the Board's recommendations that OCRWM continue
development and articulation of the waste isolation strategy, begin long-term tunnel-scale
thermal testing as quickly as possible, use total system performance assessments to refine and
test the basic tenets of the waste isolation strategy, and pursue a corrosion research program for
candidate waste package materials. OCRWM addressed these and the Board's 14 other
recommendations in a letter dated October 3, 1996.<P>
<P>
The March 1996 report, noting the renewed emphasis on storage of spent nuclear fuel as a result
of delays in the repository program, concluded that there is no compelling technical or safety
reason to move spent fuel to a central facility for the next several years. This conclusion is in
conflict with some proposals currently before the Congress that would hasten the development of
Federal interim storage. The Board's report also stated that interim storage will be needed in the
future in order to add flexibility to the system once a repository begins operating and to relieve
utilities of the need to build on-site storage at shutdown reactors. The report, which praised
recent progress in site characterization at Yucca Mountain, concluded by saying that there is no
technical reason why interim storage cannot be initiated prior to the commencement of repository
operations.<P>
<P>
The Board also held two meetings in the past several months to discuss issues related to the
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program. The Board meetings provide an effective
public forum to discuss technical issues between scientific experts and interested parties. During
these meetings, representatives of OCRWM and the Board discussed a wide range of subjects,
including an update on the Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF), plans for the disposal of defense
wastes, activities related to establishing an environmental standard for Yucca Mountain site
investigations associated with climatology and hydrology, and Program budget priorities.<P>
<P>
At the meeting held April 30 - May 1, 1996, OCRWM staff and contractors discussed aspects of
the Program's plans that have been revised as a result of funding reductions and guidance from
the President and Congress. OCRWM Deputy Director Lake Barrett presented an overview of the
revised Program described in the 

<a href="/pages/intro/planltr.htm"><cite>Draft Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan</cite></a>,
Revision 1 (<a href="01entprs.htm">see related article</a>). The Board expressed a strong interest in
the Program's strategy for determining the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site.<P>
<P>
Dr. Stephan Brocoum, Assistant Manager for Licensing at the Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization Office, discussed the technical basis for the revised site characterization
program. Dr. Brocoum noted that the recent synthesis of the data collected from more than a
decade of surface-based investigations of Yucca Mountain and the observations and testing from
the ESF have appreciably enhanced our understanding of Yucca Mountain. This understanding
has made it possible to further focus the remaining work required to support the viability
assessment, evaluation of site suitability, and preparation of a license application.<P>
<P>
Mr. Dwight Shelor, Deputy Director of the Office of Waste Acceptance, Storage, and
Transportation, updated the Board on plans for redirecting the waste acceptance, storage, and
transportation functions. The revised approach implements a market-driven strategy that relies on
competitive contracts with the private sector.<P>
<P>
The Board also met July 9 - 10, 1996, in Denver, Colorado, to review recent progress in the
investigations at Yucca Mountain and to examine the detail of OCRWM's climatology and
hydrology studies. An update on the substantial progress in the construction of the ESF, as the
tunnel boring machine has reached the turn for the south ramp following completion of the main
loop, and the results of surface-based and underground investigations were provided to the
Board. The update on the testing program highlighted the information being obtained from
mapping and sampling activities in the ESF. The correlation of features mapped underground
with surface mapping and model predictions is enhancing the understanding of the geology and
structural features of the Yucca Mountain site. The underground sampling activities are
providing insights regarding the flow of water through the mountain. These insights are essential
to understanding the site and assessing the performance of a potential repository located
there.<P>
<P>
The majority of the meeting was spent reviewing the climatology investigations and modeling,
and the related aspects of the hydrology program. The discussions included a series of technical
presentations on the latest results of investigations, and the use of the data and its implications
for performance assessments. The meeting culminated in a round-table discussion involving the
Board and its staff, Program participants, representatives of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and the State of Nevada, and invited experts on the significance and interpretation
of the information presented during the 2-day meeting.<P>
<P>
In addition to issuing reports and interacting with the Program during public meetings, the Board
continues to communicate its interest in geologic issues at Yucca Mountain through other means.
For example, in late May, the Board wrote a letter to the Secretary of Energy and Members of
Congress commenting on the recent discovery of elevated levels of chlorine-36 in some of the
rock samples collected from the ESF <a href="11entprs.htm">(see related article)</a>, the importance
of completing the waste containment and isolation strategy, and the progress of tunneling the
ESF. The Department responded on July 8 by describing the status of activities related to these
issues &#150 issues OCRWM plans to address further.<P>

<TITLE>OCRWM Submits TSAR to NRC, Achieving Milestone</TITLE>
<H2><HEAD>OCRWM Submits TSAR to NRC, Achieving Milestone</HEAD></H2>
<HR>

<BODY>
OCRWM achieved a program milestone on September 26, 1996, when it submitted the Dry
Transfer System (DTS) Topical Safety Analysis Report (TSAR) to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) staff for review and approval. The TSAR addresses the technology needed
to transfer spent nuclear fuel between storage and/or transportation casks in a dry environment.
The DTS could aid shutdown reactors in decommissioning activities and allow utilities with
limited pool space or crane capacity to take advantage of the new generation of higher-capacity,
more efficient spent fuel storage and transport systems. The design was developed in concert
with the Electric Power Research Institute and Transnuclear, Inc., of Hawthorne, New York.
OCRWM has requested that the NRC staff document its review and acceptance of the proposed
design and operations in a Safety Evaluation Report by April of 1998. On October 28, 1996,
OCRWM received a letter from the NRC stating that the DTS submittal "...contains the

<TITLE>Scientists Turn Up the Heat for Exploratory Studies Facility Alcove Thermal Tests</TITLE>
<H2><HEAD>Scientists Turn Up the Heat for Exploratory Studies Facility Alcove Thermal Tests</HEAD></H2>
<HR>

<BODY>
Scientists and engineers know that the up-to-70,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel and
high-level radioactive waste slated for disposal in the Nation's first repository will create a great
deal of heat for a very long time. What they are less sure of is precisely how the moisture in the
rock at Yucca Mountain will respond to this added heat. Determining that is crucial; this heat
will impact the performance of the repository both during its first 100 years, when it is
operational, and the subsequent thousands of years after it has been sealed.<P>
<P>
Researchers at Yucca Mountain will work to resolve these issues with several short- and
long-term heater tests in alcoves and small tunnels excavated along the main tunnel of the
mountain's underground Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF). These thermal tests, the first of
which began on August 26, 1996, will examine the effects of waste-generated heat on the
hydrological, mechanical, and geochemical properties and processes in the rock. <P>

<img  Alt="[Diagram of heater test used to measuremeasure rock's response to heat ] " src="hotrod.jpg "Align=right height=340 width=330>
<P>
Understanding the various heat-driven processes that take place in the rock will help researchers
confirm elements of the waste containment and isolation strategy for a repository at Yucca
Mountain, as well as facets of repository design.

<H3>Scientists Focus on Physical and Chemical Processes</H3>

There are four processes that concern researchers in these tests: thermal, mechanical,
hydrological, and chemical.<P>
<P>
The increase in temperature and attendant flow of heat in the rock are examples of thermal
processes. Movement in or of the rock, and changes in the rock stress, are mechanical processes.
Stress brought about by external forces causes strain, or deformation, in an elastic material such
as rock. The movement of water in the rock, in contrast, is a hydrologic process, while the
behavior and changes in minerals subjected to sustained heat are chemical processes.<P>
<P>
Scientists have developed conceptual models of these processes as they might occur at Yucca
Mountain. These are based upon laboratory tests, smaller heater tests conducted elsewhere in the
country (including at the Nevada Test Site), observations of natural geothermal phenomena, and
knowledge of the laws of physics.<P>
<P>
The thermal tests planned for Yucca Mountain will help scientists refine and confirm these
models. This will give greater credibility to those parts of the assessment of the repository's
performance that are based on such models.<P>
<P>
The heat generated by spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in the region close to
the waste packages will be important to the performance of the waste packages and the repository
rock itself. Mechanical, hydrological, and chemical processes in these areas can take place even
in the absence of heat from emplaced waste; however, they are intensified in the presence of heat,
and are affected by each other. This interaction is called "coupling." An understanding of coupled
processes is essential for an assessment of the performance of a repository.<P>

<H3>What Happens to Water in Rock Pores When the Rock Is Heated?</H3>

A primary reason why Yucca Mountain is being characterized for a repository is that the rock
there is unsaturated. The unsaturated zone refers to the rocks and soil above the water table.
There is some water in this rock, though that water may move very slowly. Little or no water is
expected to reach the emplaced waste, and any water that does contact the waste packages is not
expected to leave the repository for thousands of years. As a result, the waste will remain
isolated.<P>
<P>
One of the objectives of the thermal tests planned for Yucca Mountain, however, is to observe
the actual behavior of whatever water can be found in the rock when it is mobilized by heat. As
the rock is heated by the waste, the existing water that fills about two-thirds of the pores of the
rock will evaporate and be driven off in all directions away from the waste. As this water vapor
reaches cooler regions in the rock, some of it will condense. It can then drain through fractures to
the water table below, bypassing the repository. Or it may be absorbed into the rock near where it
condenses. This process could saturate the rock some distance below and above the waste. After
many thousands of years, when the heat from the waste has completely dissipated, some of the
condensed water above the waste may move down to the waste. If it is able to corrode the steel
waste packages and dissolve the wastes, it could ultimately transport radionuclides into the
accessible environment.<P>

<img  Alt="[Diagram of thermal test alcove ] " src="testalcv.jpg "Align=right height=450 width=325>


<H3>A Naturally Ventilated Mountain</H3>

Other scenarios are being considered as well. The host rock in Yucca Mountain is highly
fractured, and gases, such as air or water vapor, move through it quite rapidly. The fractures
provide the mountain with natural ventilation, driven largely through variations in barometric
pressure at various locations around it. The heat from emplaced waste is expected to raise the
temperature of the rock very slowly, and evaporation will occur slowly as well. Much of the pore
water could, as a result, be carried away as vapor through the fractures instead of condensing
above or below the waste.<P>

<H3>Shake-Down Test Precedes Main Test</H3>

Before beginning the main part of the ESF thermal test, called the Drift Scale Test, scientists
scheduled a small-scale shake-down test, called the Single Heater Test. This test, which began in
late August 1996, took place in an alcove situated off an observation tunnel parallel to the main
thermal test tunnel. All instruments to be used in the later Drift Scale Test are being tried out in
the shake-down phase. The heating cycle in the shake-down phase will last about 9 months,
followed by a similar period of cooling. The shake-down phase also will yield data on the rock's
thermal properties and the effect of heat upon mechanical properties. These data are needed to
interpret the more complex results from the Drift Scale Test which, in turn, are needed for the
repository design. The results of the shake-down phase will contribute to the site viability
assessment scheduled for 1998.<P>

<H3>Main Drift Scale Test Will Approximate Thermal Conditions in a Waste Emplacement
Tunnel</H3>

Now scheduled for the fall of 1997, the Drift Scale Test will take place in an area east of the ESF
main tunnel, just beyond the curve at the bottom of the north ramp. An observation drift, which
scientists will use to monitor and observe the main test tunnel, has been excavated at a station
located 2,827 meters (9,275 feet) from the facility's main entrance. Construction of the test
alcoves and related small tunnels began in January 1996.<P>
<P>
In the Drift Scale Test, a 55-meter (180-foot) length of tunnel similar to the ones that would
contain waste in a repository will be heated for a period of at least 2 years. Rocks, as anyone who
has ever made a campfire will attest, can take as long to cool as to heat. This heat-up period will
therefore be followed by a similar, if not longer, period of cooling. During both the heating and
the cooling periods, numerous observations and measurements will be made.<P>
<P>
<img  Alt="[Photo of scientist monitoring behavior of water in rock] " src="heater.jpg "Align=right height=290 width=367>



Heating the tunnels, or drifts, will be achieved with electric heaters placed on the floor. These
heaters will be of a size, shape, and material similar to the waste packages being considered for
emplacement. Smaller-diameter heaters, called wing heaters, will be inserted into both walls of
the drift to simulate heating in adjacent drifts. An observation drift has already been excavated
parallel to the heated tunnel location, and various types of instruments will be installed in holes
drilled from both drifts.<P>
<P>
During this test, the temperature of the accessible rock surfaces in the thermal test alcoves and
the nearby main ESF drift will be systematically mapped by infrared thermal imaging. This will
permit scientists to detect any escaping moisture/air since the gas flow affects the local rock
temperature.<P>
<P>
The high temperatures generated by the thermal tests will be limited, for the most part, to the
alcoves that were excavated for them. Workers and scientists moving about within the ESF will
be able to bypass these alcoves during the course of their excavation and research activities
without exposing themselves to excess heat or its effects.<P>

<DT>[1]       North Portal   
<DD>Situated in Exile Hill, the North Portal serves as the main entrance to the Exploratory Studies facility (ESF). Work began here in April 1993, when the first 60 meters (200 feet) of tunnel were excavated using conventional drill and blast tunnel excavation techniques. Shaped like a horseshoe and presenting an opening that is 9 meters (30 feet) wide by 10 meters (33 feet) tall, the North Portal began as the entrance to a starter tunnel for the Project's tunnel boring machine (TBM). <P>

 <DT>[1a] Ventilation System 
<DD>The ESF ventilation system exhausts air through a metal duct line. Dusty air is sucked up at the cutterhead of the tunnel boring machine, passes through a cleaning filter attached to the TBM's trailing gear, and is exhausted through the vent ducts using booster fans. This creates an artificial low pressure zone at the cutterhead. Clean air is sucked into the tunnel at the portal, causing fresh air to flow freely into the tunnel all the way to the cutterhead.<P>

<DT>[3]     Bow Ridge Fault 
<DD>The Bow Ridge Fault was created by a faulting process originating approximately 12 million years ago and has had recurrent, episodic movement since then. This fault is the largest vertical displacement fault yet encountered in the ESF. The term "vertical displacement" refers to the east side of the fault having remained approximately 100 meters (328 feet) higher relative to the west side of the fault, as a result of movement along the fault. The rocks on each side of the fault have different characteristics. As a result, water and fluids may flow through the rocks differently on each side. Scientists are particularly interested in learning what happens to flow rates and behavior of water and other fluids at the interface between these distinct bodies of rock, as well as along the fault itself.<P>

<DT>[4]       Bow Ridge Fault Alcove (Alcove 2)
<DD>In this alcove, scientists have drilled boreholes across the Bow Ridge Fault. They plan to map any fractures or geologic features they encounter within these boreholes. Then, they will use inflatable balloons to pack off, or physically separate, distinct geologic segments, or units, that the boreholes pass through. Once these segments are separated from each other, scientists can either remove gases from each segment for analysis or insert gases under pressure to see how the gases move through the rock. By monitoring each borehole separately, and then together and in combinations, they can determine how the distinct geologic units govern the flow of gases and fluids. They can also determine how these different geologic units interact in allowing or obstructing the flow of gases and fluids.<P>

<DD>This alcove is located near the point of contact between two distinctly different rock types that lie one atop the other. In the upper part of the alcove, scientists will examine a segment of hard, dense welded tuff, in the lower, a section of relatively weaker and less dense non-welded tuff. As in the other ESF alcoves, scientists are interested in how gases and fluids move within and between each rock type.<P>

<DT>[7]       Imbricate Fault Zone 
<DD>This is a zone of rock containing a series of small near-vertical faults that probably resulted from the same geologic stresses. Scientists are particularly interested in the zone because it might provide a fast pathway for water moving underground. This is one of the reasons that the borehole UZ-16 (UZ stands for "Unsaturated Zone") was drilled in this zone from the surface, about 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) south of the north ramp. The northern extension of this zone intersects the north ramp.<P>

<DD>The Ghost Dance Fault is the main fault found within the potential repository area. Scientists are studying the fault to assess its influence on how water or gases might move from the surface through the mountain. Does the fault act as a barrier to the flow of water and other fluids, or does it actually enhance flow?<P>

<DD>Heaters will be installed within the rock in the alcove and alcove drifts to investigate the effects of long-term heat generation on the rock, as well as on water vapor movement through it. Structural or chemical changes in the rock due to heating, and thermal effects on installed ground support systems, will also be investigated. These heating tests will occur over several years.<P>

<TITLE>OCRWM Publishes Proposal for Implementing Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act</TITLE>
<H2><HEAD>OCRWM Publishes Proposal for Implementing Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act</HEAD></H2>
<HR>

<BODY>
The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) published a <A HREF="/pages/resource/fedreg/180c.htm">Notice of
Proposed Policy and Procedures</A> in the <cite>Federal Register</cite> (Vol. 61, No. 96) on May 16, 1996,
presenting its proposal for implementing Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982, as amended. The Notice describes OCRWM's proposed funding mechanism, definitions of
key terms, eligibility for and timing of grants, and allowability of activities to implement the
Act's mandate for the training of public safety officials in jurisdictions along planned radioactive
waste transportation routes. It also includes OCRWM's responses to public comments that were
solicited on two previous <cite>Federal Register</cite> Notices of Inquiry regarding Section 180(c)
implementation, and requests public comments on the proposed policy and procedures. As a
result of public demand, the public comment period was extended from August 15 to September
29, 1996, per notice in the <a href="/pages/resource/fedreg/180excp.htm"><cite>Federal Register</cite> dated August 12</a>. OCRWM received 38 comments in
response to the proposed policy and procedures.<P>
<P>
Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, requires the Department of Energy
(DOE) to provide funding and technical assistance to States and Tribes to train local public safety
officials in jurisdictions through which the Department of Energy plans to transport spent nuclear
fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Such training would cover safe routine transportation
procedures as well as emergency-response procedures.<P>
<P>
OCRWM has been soliciting public input on the implementation of Section 180(c) for several
years through various public forums, including meetings of OCRWM's Transportation
Coordination Group and the Department's Transportation External Coordination Working Group
and various cooperative agreement groups. Taking into account this public input, and research
collected on training programs with similar funding, OCRWM's proposal would create a program
with minimal administrative burden that offers the greatest flexibility for recipients.<P>
<P>
OCRWM has proposed DOE grants as the funding mechanism. Approximately 4 years prior to
transporting spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste through State or Tribal lands,
OCRWM would send information and application packages to Governors and Tribal
chairpersons notifying them that they may be eligible for Federal assistance under Section 180(c),
and explaining how they may apply for funding and how much funding they are likely to receive
over the ensuing 3 years. The State or Tribe would then submit an application describing a 3-year
plan of how they would use the funding each year. Funding would be disbursed annually based
on the applicant's plan. Approximately 2 years prior to initiation of transportation operations,
OCRWM would announce proposed routes.<P>
<P>
The proposed policy and procedures do not set specific training goals, nor do they prescribe who
may receive training. The recipient jurisdictions would be allowed to select their own training
and the training participants, as long as these decisions were part of an approved application. The
proposal does note, however, that OCRWM will work with jurisdictions to provide technical
assistance. It also notes OCRWM's response capabilities that would be available at the request of
the jurisdiction, and that other information and expertise would be provided. Available funding
would consist of a base amount and a variable amount. The variable amount will be based on
route miles through a jurisdiction. Up to 10 percent of the total amount of a recipient's funding
each year may be used to purchase training-related equipment.<P>
<P>
As a follow-up to the release of the proposal, OCRWM will publish a Notice of Final Policy and
Procedures in June 1997.<P>

As a follow-up to the <a href="/pages/resource/fedreg/eoi.htm">Expression of Interest and Comments</a> published in the May 24, 1996,
<cite>Commerce Business Daily </cite>and in the May 28, 1996, <cite>Federal Register</cite> (Vol. 61103), the Office of
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) held a Pre-solicitation conference for

in Washington, D.C. The conference was held to solicit the industry's and vendors' views on
OCRWM's current plans to develop a waste acceptance and transportation strategy that relies on
the private sector for implementation so that spent nuclear fuel can be accepted from utilities by
commercial contractors and moved to an interim storage facility or a repository as soon as either
is available. <P>

<!--<img  Alt="[Samuel Ruosso, Director of OCRWM's Office of Waste Acceptance , Storage and Transportation, welcomes conference participants.] " src="speech.jpg "Align=right height=310 width=300>-->


The full-day meeting included an overview of OCRWM's market-driven approach and
descriptions of the proposed scope of work for which private contractors would be responsible.
Brief descriptions of the responsibilities OCRWM and its potential contractors would assume in
regard to planning, preparation, and transportation activities were included.<P>
<P>
Prior to the conference, a <a href="/waste/eoi/sow.htm">draft Statement of Work</a> and OCRWM's Office of Waste Acceptance,
Storage, and Transportation's <a href="/waste/eoi/conops.htm"><cite>Draft Concept of Operations</cite></a> were distributed. Both documents are
available for viewing via the links above or can be obtained
through the OCRWM National Information Center at 600 Maryland Avenue, SW, Suite 695,
Washington, D.C. 20024. <P>
<P>
OCRWM is in the process of developing a draft request for proposals for review by the industry.
It is hoped that OCRWM's approach will provide a market stimulus for private sector
development of the requisite equipment and technology.<P>

<H2><HEAD>Working Group Meets to Discuss Transportation Issues</HEAD></H2>
<HR>

<BODY>
The <A HREF="/waste/tec.htm">Transportation External Coordination Working Group (TEC)</A> held its ninth semiannual
meeting July 16-18, 1996, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. TEC, a partnership between the
Department of Energy (DOE) and its stakeholder organizations, works to identify and resolve
significant issues related to DOE's transportation of radioactive materials. TEC's members
include personnel from various DOE program and project offices, including the Office of
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) and the Office of Environmental
Management; national and regional organizations representing State, Tribal, and local
governments; professional associations; and industry organizations.<P>
<P>
The first day of meetings included a series of plenary sessions updating participants on various
DOE transportation activities. OCRWM presented an update of Program activities along with its
market-driven transportation strategy, and the Office of Environmental Management provided
updates on its spent nuclear fuel program, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, and its transportation
re-engineering effort. The market-driven strategy generated many questions about the role of
OCRWM versus the planned role of a transportation contractor. Other plenary sessions provided
an update on the TEC training subcommittee's work and member perspectives on current TEC
initiatives. Several members raised additional points for the TEC training subcommittee to
consider, such as potential training differences for responding to a rail versus a highway accident
and the role railroads play in training for a potential emergency.<P>
<P>
The second day was comprised of a series of breakout sessions designed to further discussion,
problem-identification, and problem-solving relating to various DOE transportation issues. These
sessions focused on transportation-related public information activities conducted by the Office
of Environmental Management and OCRWM's <cite>Federal Register</cite><a href="/pages/resource/fedreg/180c.htm"> Notice of Proposed Policy and
Procedures for Section 180(c)</a> of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended. The breakout
groups discussed, among other issues, the appropriate uses of Section 180(c) funds, such as
whether the program should cover personnel costs, emergency-response equipment, and risk
assessments. The Transportation Operations session discussed developments in DOE's
transportation operations, including a discussion about the status of State authority to stop and
inspect trains, whether the Nuclear Waste Fund could be the source of funds for infrastructure
improvements, and whether DOE can streamline the transportation analysis for National
Environmental Policy Act documents while maintaining the integrity of the process. This
breakout also included presentations about OCRWM's market-driven transportation strategy and
safe dry storage of spent nuclear fuel.<P>
<P>
The breakout groups also discussed the results of a survey of TEC members that asked about
TEC's usefulness and how it might be improved. One of the results of this discussion was the
formation of Topic Groups that will work throughout the year to discuss issues in more detail
than the larger TEC breakout sessions would allow.<P>
<P>
The second day also featured a plenary session presentation by University of New Mexico staff
on the results of a national survey on public perceptions of transportation risks.<P>
<P>
On the final half-day, participants attended a plenary session and a summary of the breakout
sessions. During the plenary discussion, external agency representatives provided presentations
on their emergency response training programs. Representatives of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation,
the Department of Agriculture, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission participated.<P>
<P>
A copy of the TEC meeting summary report is available through the OCRWM National
Information Center at 1-800-225-6972 (202-488-6720 in Washington, D.C.). In writing, send

<H2><HEAD>Chlorine-36 Found in Yucca Mountain Suggests Possible Fast Routes from Surface to
Repository Depths</HEAD></H2>
<HR>

<BODY>
Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory have detected elevated levels of chlorine-36
in rock samples collected from several locations within the Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF)
tunnel. This tunnel has been excavated to afford geologists with direct access to those parts of
Yucca Mountain that might be able to contain a repository.<P>
<P>
The elevated levels of chlorine-36, which scientists believe originated from atmospheric nuclear
tests conducted about 4 decades ago, were found at 5 locations, and at depths of up to 185 meters
(600 feet) from the surface of Yucca Mountain, along the first 3.4 kilometers (2.11 miles) of the
tunnel. Scientists knew from the outset that such findings were a possibility. Indeed, site models
dating back to 1983-1985 anticipated fast pathways through the mountain. The existence of such
paths did not in itself constitute an adverse condition. <P>
<P>
Scientists think that the chlorine-36 traveled from the surface along one or several fast pathways,
most probably through fractures and faults. It is still too early, though, to determine whether the
presence of elevated levels of chlorine-36 inside the ESF has any direct bearing on the
mountain's suitability as a repository site. At the least, however, the isotope should provide a
valuable method for identifying potential fast routes for surface water to get underground. <P>
<P>
No conclusions have yet been reached on the significance of the detection of chlorine-36 within
the facility. Further tests must be completed for scientists to better understand the hydrologic
processes at work in Yucca Mountain. 

<H3>Chlorine-36 Serves As a Valuable Tracer</H3>

Chlorine-36 is a cosmogenic isotope. An isotope is one of several different atoms of a particular
element having the same nuclear charge but different nuclear mass. The term "cosmogenic"
refers to the isotope's origin through the natural interaction of existing materials with high-energy
particles in cosmic rays shooting through the atmosphere. <P>

<P><img  Alt="[Photograph:  Workers in Alcove 1 of the Exploratory Studies Facility remove rock samples for laboratory analysis.  Lab test have detected five occurences of chlorine-36 in the rock ] " src="chlrne1.jpg " Align=right height=275 width=300>



With a half-life of 301,000 years, chlorine-36 is one of several cosmogenic isotopes (such as
tritium and carbon-14) that serve as valuable tracers of geologic, hydrologic, atmospheric, and
oceanographic processes. For example, one can theoretically use isotopes to estimate the length
of time that a segment of water has been in the ground. This is done by comparing the amount of
an isotope dissolved in the water to the amount found in the soil at the surface.<P>
<P>
Cosmogenic isotopes like chlorine-36 also were created through the interaction of nuclear
explosions with materials found on the Earth and in the atmosphere. Most of these isotopes came
from the above-ground testing of nuclear weapons, primarily in the Pacific Ocean, from 1952 to
1958. Scientists generally assume, therefore, that most occurrences of chlorine-36 elevated above
natural levels are recent, that is, within the last half-century, probably during the nuclear tests of
the 1950s. Yet they must perform further tests that would establish this with certainty.<P>
<P>
Toward that end, they continue to look for evidence of other isotopes from nuclear testing, such
as tritium, technetium-99, or iodine-129, in areas where chlorine-36 was found. Because some
isotopes exhibit chemical behavior similar to that of chlorine-36, those isotopes will have moved
down through the same pathways at much the same rate, and in the same way.<P>
<P>
Though unlikely, there may, in fact, be another potential source for the elevated chlorine-36
samples found within the ESF. Elevated levels of the isotope may be attributable to cosmogenic
reactions within the rock involving calcite. Calcite, or calcium carbonate, is an abundant mineral
found at the Earth's surface, and especially in the arid soil at Yucca Mountain and other parts of
the Southwest. Recent research has indicated that cosmic rays can interact with calcite and other
calcium-bearing minerals, causing levels of chlorine-36 similar to those created by nuclear
detonations. Scientists at Yucca Mountain are therefore exploring whether enough chlorine-36
can be mobilized at the surface to produce the elevated ratios found underground. Preliminary
calculations indicate this is possible, though not likely. <P>
<P>
As site characterization continues, and the tunnel boring machine advances, additional water and
rock samples will be collected and analyzed for further occurrences of chlorine-36. These tests
will be performed within the context of the detailed, integrated hydrologic sampling, testing, and
modeling program already under way at Yucca Mountain. 

<H3>How Could Elevated Chlorine-36 Levels Appear at Repository Depths?</H3>

Yucca Mountain consists of a faulted eastward-tilted block of layered volcanic rock. Each layer,
or unit, responds differently to water. Above the water table, these rock units are unsaturated,
meaning that the pore spaces in the rock are occupied by both air and water. In unsaturated rock,
scientists normally expect water to move downward very slowly    perhaps a fraction of a
millimeter a year. However, in response to large amounts of precipitation, it is possible for water
to move much more rapidly through fractures and faults.<P>


<img  Alt="[Diagram:  A cross-section of Yucca Mountain showing how  water appears to have moved from the surface through the various rock layers down to the parts of thr proposed repository level.] " src="chlrne2.gif " hieght=329 width=559><p>

<p>


Yucca Mountain is cut by several downward-extending faults. The elevated chlorine-36 levels
found at three of five locations in the tunnel occurred in areas that are associated with known
faults. Samples showed elevated levels of chlorine-36 near the entrance to the facility within the
Bow Ridge Fault, near the Drill Hole Wash Structure, and at the intersection of the Sundance
Fault with the facility's tunnel. Two of the samples were found in fractures in the facility, but
were not directly associated with major faults at the surface. <P>
<P>
Scientists believe that faults and fractures can act either as conduits or barriers to the flow of
water in the unsaturated zone. In some locations, these features may have provided the fast
pathways that account for the presence of elevated chlorine-36 levels in the ESF. <P>
<P>
The fact that very little flowing water has been found at the repository depth suggests that the
layers of volcanic rock situated above the potential repository can act as a barrier to water. The
presence of very small amounts of relatively fast-moving water within the area of rock where a
repository might be excavated, though, implies that the barrier may not be uniform. It may be
breached, here and there, by pathways that can move water through the volcanic rock, and into
the underlying rock. 
<H3>
Conceptual Models for  Rapid Flow Pathways</H3>

Researchers have proposed three possibilities that could account for the presence of rapid-flow
pathways through the layers of volcanic rock found above the potential repository horizon.<P>
<P>
The least plausible of these is the existence of a small zone of saturated rock at the top of one of
the tuff units that transmits water by downward flow through the rock largely by way of gravity.
Once this flow has crossed one type of rock, the water may be transmitted to fractures in another
type, and begin to move more rapidly. This is considered unlikely, however, because the time
required for such rapid flow through this rock is too long to account for the presence of the
isotope.<P>
<P>
A second, somewhat more likely possibility, involves the existence of random clusters of
interconnected, vertical fractures. Conceivably, these could capture water entering the volcanic
rock from above, and also water moving through the rock laterally. Available evidence suggests
that the volcanic rock situated above the potential repository is relatively unfractured. But the
data are scarce. They do not exclude the possibility of localized zones in this layer that are
densely fractured. <P>
<P>
If this were the case, however, researchers would expect to find elevated levels of chlorine-36 at
random locations along the ESF. However, several of the occurrences of chlorine-36 detected so
far do not appear to be randomly distributed along the ESF. Rather, they seem to be correlated
with known faults or fractures.<P>
<P>
This leads to the third, and perhaps most likely alternative: that faults like the Bow Ridge and
Ghost Dance faults may be the most likely candidate pathways. This is because these faults are
known to run through all of the mountain's tuff units more or less vertically. <P>
<P>
In nature, as in science, the simplest explanation is often the most probable. But scientists have
not yet studied the faults located within the unsaturated zone sufficiently to permit a definitive
determination. In particular, their hydrologic properties and behavior have not been completely
tested. <P>
<P>
Scientists do, however, think it unlikely that any fast paths that exist ever provided a continuous
flow of water from the surface to the repository horizon. When intersected by the ESF tunnel,
these faults showed no evidence of recent water flow. Probably, any water that did flow
downward through these faults flowed periodically. Most likely, it did so in response to
unusually heavy storms at the surface. 

<H3>A Critical Issue Still To Be Resolved</H3>

A critical issue still to be resolved is whether existing faults can sustain rapid water flow into and
through the unsaturated zone. The preliminary correlation between faults and the occurrences of
elevated chlorine-36 within the ESF would seem to suggest one strong possibility: that some
faults, in some places, and at some times over the last 40 years, provided a quick route down to at
least part of the unsaturated zone.<P>

<TITLE>Yucca Mountain Public Outreach Efforts</TITLE>
<H2><HEAD>Yucca Mountain Public Outreach Efforts</HEAD></H2>
<HR>

<BODY>
The Yucca Mountain Project has always provided an open door to the public. One way it has
done so has been by making the Yucca Mountain personnel and various information resources
and facilities very accessible to the public. <P>
<P>
Last year, for instance, the Yucca Mountain Project conducted over 167 tours of the mountain
and its facilities. In 1995, over 3,574 people set aside an entire day to see for themselves how
scientists are studying the geology, hydrology, weather patterns, and flora and fauna of this area.
Included among the visitors during 18 fact-finding tours were 12 members of Congress and over
200 congressional staff members. 

<H3>Mountain Tour Highlights</H3>

During a typical mountain tour, visitors can:<P>
<UL>
<LI> Visit the crest of Yucca Mountain and learn how the mountain was formed<P>

<LI> See ancient volcanic cinder cones and discuss the prospects (extremely slim) that they'll erupt
in the next 10,000 years<P>

<LI> Talk to scientists about the geologic features of Yucca Mountain and how they might
contribute to the isolation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste<P>

<LI> Stop by the entrance to the construction of a sophisticated underground laboratory called the
Exploratory Studies Facility (the facility now provides scientists with an underground view of the
rock where a repository could be built)<P>

<LI> View exhibits that explain the various studies.<P>
</UL>


<H3>Science Centers: A Place To Ask Questions</H3>

The Yucca Mountain Project operates three science centers in Las Vegas, Beatty, and Pahrump,
Nevada. These are designed to offer the public an opportunity to explore the complexities of a
large-scale scientific project such as this one. In 1995, these science centers attracted over 15,000
visitors.<P>
<P>


<img  Alt="[Photograph:  Visitors in the Yucca Mountain Project Science Centers avail themselves of a wide range of interactive exhibits.] " src="outrch3.jpg " Align=left height=250 width=275>




Tours through the science centers are intended to help answer questions and address public
concerns about the Project. At the Las Vegas Science Center, visitors can even take an elevator
ride down to the Climax Mine Spent Fuel Test, a replica of a test conducted more than a decade
ago. Results of this test showed how spent nuclear fuel could be placed underground, stored, and
then retrieved successfully.<P>

There are other exhibits, displays, and specialty rooms, such as a geology room where visitors
learn about volcanoes, earthquakes, the travel time of water moving through the mountain, and
minerals. Individuals wishing to engage in independent research, meanwhile, may avail
themselves of resource areas containing collections of reading and audiovisual material pertinent
to the Project, including print information from public-domain sources.<P>
<P>
Science center visitors also attend a variety of scientific lectures offered as part of a year-round
speaker series. Topics range from earthquakes and geologic faults to desert wildflowers; from the
movement of water through rocks to the effects of light, sound, and electromagnetic waves.
People engage with experts in assorted fields; view informative illustrations, photographs, and
videos; ask questions; and broaden their knowledge on various subjects of general and specific
interest.<P>
<P><P>


<img  Alt="[Photograph:  Visitors to Yucca Mountain are driven to its crest where a commanding view encourages discussions with the scientists about the geologic features of the mountain and the surrounding area.] " src="outrch1.jpg " Align=right height=275 width=300>



"Discovery Day" events are scheduled yearly at these centers, providing an opportunity for the
public, and particularly for parents and children, to engage in shared, hands-on learning
experiences. At a Discovery Day with a geology theme, for instance, people built volcanoes,
made fossils, learned what a geologic fault is, and found out about the best locations to look for
gold. Last year's event attracted over 225 people.<P>

The point of all of these activities &#150 tours of the mountain and visits to Project science centers &#150 is
to provide avenues to access information. Visitors come because they want to see for themselves
what's going on, because they recognize an opportunity for public and personal involvement, and
because the resources at their disposal make it possible to use all the information available to
draw their own conclusions.

<H3>Tours of Yucca Mountain</H3>

The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management's Yucca Mountain Project invites you to
take tours of the Yucca Mountain area and to talk to scientists and staff members about ongoing
studies.<P>
<P>

<img  Alt="[Photograph:  Public tours of Yucca Mountain begin at the Las Vegas Science Center where there are many hands-on exibits that help people understand how Yucca Mountain and other geologic features were formed.] " src="outrch2.jpg " Align=right height=225 width=200>



Reservations should be made at least 14 days in advance by calling (702) 794-7104 during
business hours. Tours will be filled on a first-come, first served basis.<P>
<P>
Yucca Mountain is about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. To visit the site, information such as
full names, addresses, social security numbers, dates and places of birth, and telephone numbers
must be provided when making a reservation. Tours are open to any U.S. citizen over the age of
14. Non-U.S. citizens must allow for about a month between applying and receiving
authorization to take the tour.<P>
<P>
Box lunches will be provided for $4 per person. Lunches come with beverages, but sodas can be
purchased for an additional 60 cents.<P><HR>

<TITLE>In His Own Words...Wesley Barnes</TITLE>
<H2><HEAD>In His Own Words...Wesley Barnes</HEAD></H2>
<HR>

<BODY>
It's been a little over a year since Wesley Barnes began managing the Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization Project. In that year much has happened   significant budget cuts, personnel
reductions, revised program direction, and relocation of the Project Office at the base of the La
Madre Mountains in northwestern Las Vegas. What follows are his words and thoughts as he
began his second year.<P>
<P>
<B>Q.   Mr. Barnes, what do you most want readers to understand about the Yucca Mountain
Project?</B><P>
<P>
<B>A. </B>  I want them to understand that this is a world-class project and that this is a job worth doing.
That is why people stay when there is so much daily adversity. When I first came here and
experienced the adversity   the negative accounts in the media, the people who persist in painting
portraits that have nothing to do with the facts, I wondered why the talented professionals,
world-class professionals that we have, stay here? Why would they want to take this abuse, deal
with the complicated bureaucracy, the politics that impact us? I believe they stay because they
have found this is a job worth doing   in spite of the adversity.<P>
<P>


<img  Alt="[Photograph:  Project Manager Wesley Barnes discusses geological processes with Deputy Project Manager Russ Dyer] " src="barnes.jpg " Align=right height=320 width=368>




<B>Q.  Are there any other repositories in the world? How does our progress in establishing a
repository compare with other nations with similar goals?<P></B> 
<P>
<B>A.  </B> I was recently briefed on the world situation, with regard to nations that have repository
programs. Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and
the United Kingdom have active repository or underground research laboratory programs that are
making progress. If we stay on our current path, we will be ahead of those programs when we
reach the license application stage.<P>
     We have made a great deal of progress in our investigation of Yucca Mountain. When I first
came here a year ago, there was so much more uncertainty. This was a research project that had
not gotten to the analysis stage in very many areas. Much of that has now changed. Our scientists
have studied the data from extensive scientific and analytical work performed since site
characterization began, and have confirmed various early hypotheses about the mountain. In the
process, they also have reduced some scientific and technical uncertainties about its potential
performance as a repository.<P>
<P>
<B>Q.   What are the chief hurdles the Project faces right now?</B><P>
<P>
<B>A.   </B>Human limitations, preconceptions, and biases. But I see some of that changing, and believe
that enough is changing to allow us to accomplish our mission of site characterization,
preparation of the Yucca Mountain Viability Assessment, evaluation of site suitability,
development of an environmental impact statement, a Secretarial site recommendation to the
President, and a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.<P>
<P>
<B>Q.   How was it to go back into the public sector after the time you've spent in the private sector?</B>
<P>
<P>
<B>A. </B>  It's been tough.  When I first took the job, I was blinded by the happiness I felt at being back
with people I highly respect, working for Dr. Dreyfus and on an important project. Then I began
feeling the effects of the bureaucracy and the adversity; it was tough. But now that feeling has
passed. It's getting easier for me because it is easier for me to control myself. <P>
<P>
     However, one of the things I wouldn't change, you know how journalists sometimes ask you,
"If you were God for a day, what would you change?..." One of the things I wouldn't change is
the news media. I believe they fill a valuable role. I do worry, however, about the long-term
effects of such negative coverage. If professionals feel continually unfairly maligned and
misrepresented, the dynamic will be that those who are talented leave the Project and go work
somewhere that's not so adversarial. It could be that over time, the news media may actually
contribute to a sort of selective process that selects for people who aren't really talented, who
don't have so many options, who can't choose to go elsewhere.... Thank goodness that has not
happened. As I said earlier, I'm deeply impressed that we have the talented people we do and that
so many have stayed for years.<P>
<P>
     And, in the larger view, my life has come full circle. I'm now working in the Federal
department I helped create. It's not at all now what we envisioned then, because we were focused
on solving an energy crisis when we helped write legislation to create the Department of Energy.
<P>
<P>
     Those days when we were working on the creation of the Department were great. As I look at
the Department of Energy today, I realize that I am part of making this history.<P>

<html><h2>Notice of Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Services</h2>
<hr>
<body>
<strong>AGENCY:</strong> Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, Department of
Energy. <p>
<strong>ACTION:</strong> Request for expression of interest and comments.<p>
<strong>SUMMARY:</strong> The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) is
responsible under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (NWPA) for
transporting spent nuclear fuel (spent fuel) from commercial nuclear reactor sites to a
Federal facility for storage or disposal. The Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent
Fuel and/or High Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR part 961) details the arrangements
between the Department and the owners and generators of spent fuel (Purchasers) for
the Department to accept the spent fuel at the Purchasers' sites for transport to the
receiving Federal facility. Section 137(a)2 of the NWPA requires the utilization of
private industry to the "fullest extent possible" in the transportation of spent fuel.
 OCRWM is developing a plan for the performance of its waste acceptance, storage
and transportation responsibilities which are set forth in the NWPA and Standard
Contract and is soliciting input from interested parties as to its proposed approach.
 DATES: Submissions of interest and comments in response to this Notice should be
received by the Department no later than three weeks from the date of this
announcement. A presolicitation conference may be held this summer, if so, a separate
Notice will be issued identifying the date. Respondents to this Notice will be placed on
a list to receive additional information which may include draft solicitation documents
in preparation for the presolicitation conference.<p>
<strong>ADDRESSES:</strong> Submissions of interest including any comments should be sent to:
Michelle Miskinis, Contracting Officer, U. S. Dept. Of Energy, 1000 Independence
Ave. SW, Attention: HR - 561.21, Washington D.C. 20585. <p>
<strong>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</strong> Ms Michelle Miskinis
(DOE/HR+561.21), 202-634-4413 or Ms Beth Tomasoni (DOE/HR-561.21),     202-634-4408. <p>
<strong>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</strong> The following describes key features of the
OCRWM proposed approach:<br>
Scope of Services: DOE anticipates contracting for supplies and services which
would include: accepting spent fuel from Purchasers' facilities (as identified in the
Acceptance Priority Ranking and Annual Capacity Reports and supplying compatible
transportation (and possibly storage) casks and equipment and transporting spent fuel
to a designated Federal facility. Contractors would also be responsible for any
intermodal transport required, including heavy haul. Contractors may be permitted to
alter the order of spent-fuel acceptance to achieve efficiency of operation or to lower
costs. Contractors would work with Purchasers to determine the best way to service a
site and would recommend preferred transportation routes to the Federal facility.
Contractors will also be required to interface with those State, Local and Tribal
governments along the selected routes.<p>
The location and type of Federal facility (either a repository or an interim storage
facility (ISF) cannot yet be determined. Initially, spent-fuel delivered to the Federal
site would be canistered before arrival at the facility, but at some point in the service
period the contractor may be required to handle uncanistered spent-fuel.
Transportation and storage equipment to be supplied would be required to comply
with applicable Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and Department of
Transportation (DOT) regulations, OCRWM acceptance criteria, and standard
commercial practices.<p>
Contract Type: Competitive, fixedprice type, contracts are being considered with a
phased implementation that includes sequential development of business/servicing
plans describing contractors' individual approaches, fabrication/acquisition of
hardware, and transportation services operations. More than one award is anticipated.
One approach under consideration is to divide the country into regions, for example,
the four NRC regions. No contractor would be awarded more than two regional service
contracts. It is envisioned that there will be several Requests for Proposals (RFPs)
issued over several decades for these services with more than one award made under
each RFP.<p>
Contract Term: A contract term of five to ten years is envisioned. This would allow a
contractor two to three years to procure transportation and storage equipment and
achieve operational readiness. Performance of waste acceptance and transportation
services would take place over the remaining period of any contract. A service period
spanning several years also would allow contractors the flexibility to improve the
efficiency of operations and reduce costs.<p>
Schedule: Schedule specifics will be addressed in any solicitation. For planning
purposes, it is expected that a Federal facility could be in operation to receive spent
fuel within four years of statutory direction, and contractors could be expected to begin
developing service arrangements with Purchasers two to three years before spent fuel
shipment.<p>
<strong>Submissions of Interest</strong><p>
  OCRWM is interested in receiving expressions of interest and comments relating to
this proposed approach for carrying out its waste acceptance, transportation and any
storage functions especially with regard to the following Issues:<br>
<ol>
<li>The ability of transportation service contractors and individual Purchasers to reach
agreement on methods and schedules for servicing specific utility sites, including ways
to foster Purchaser cooperation .<br>
<li>The willingness of Purchasers to construct temporary or permanent physical plant
modifications and to obtain license amendments or technical specification changes that
would improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of loading and removal of spent
fuel from individual plants.<br>
<li>The reasonableness of dividing the country into a number of regions to preserve
competition and industrial capability in the marketplace, while still ensuring low cost
services to OCRWM.<br>
<li>The capability of the nuclear industry to acquire sufficient spent fuel canister,
transportation cask, and storage module production capacity to meet near-term service
contractor requirements.<br>
<li> Potential business arrangements/ pricing structures which might increase contractor
freedom and flexibility to develop and implement innovative approaches to improve
system efficiency and lower costs, reduce or eliminate the need for front-end financing
by OCRWM of contractor activities and procurements, or mitigate risks associated
with programmatic uncertainties.<br>
<li>Alternative methods of structuring this procurement to ensure competition on
future procurements.</ol><p>
DOE will consider and may utilize all information, recommendations, and suggestions provided in response to this notice. Respondents should not provide any
information that they consider to be privileged or confidential or which the respondent
does not want disclosed to the public. DOE does not intend to respond to comments,
either to individual commentors or by publication of a formal notice. Each submittal
should consist of one original and three photocopies.
<p>
This notice should not be construed (1) as a commitment by the Department to enter
into any agreement with any entity submitting an expression of interest or comments
in response to this Notice, (2) as a commitment to issue any RFP concerning the
subject of this Notice, or (3) as a request for proposals.<p>

<p>
<strong>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</strong>
<p>
<strong>I.  Purpose and Need for Agency Action</strong>
<p>
Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.) (NWPA or "the Act"),
the Department of Energy (Department) is responsible for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste and
civilian spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository.  The Department is also responsible for the
possible monitored retrievable storage (MRS) of spent nuclear fuel prior to disposal.  Additionally, the
Department is responsible for transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste to the
Department's disposal or storage sites.  To carry out these responsibilities, the Department is required to
implement Section 180(c) of the Act.  Section 180(c) of the Act requires the Department to provide
technical assistance and funds to States for training for public safety officials of appropriate units of local
government and Indian tribes through whose jurisdiction the Secretary plans to transport spent nuclear fuel
or high-level radioactive waste.  Section 180(c) further provides that training cover procedures required for
safe routine transportation of these materials, as well as procedures for dealing with emergency response
situations.  Section 180(c) identifies the Nuclear Waste Fund under the Act as the source of funds for work
carried out under this subsection. [42 U.S.C. 10175]

<p>
<strong>II.  Section 180(c) History</strong>
<p>
The Department issued a Notice of Inquiry in the<em> Federal Register</em> on January 3, 1995, (60 FR 99) which
briefly described various options to delineate Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act policy and
procedures.  Members of the public were invited to submit comments on the Notice of Inquiry.  In the
March 14, 1995, Federal Register (60 FR 13715) the Department extended the deadline for comments to
May 18, 1995.  In response to requests for additional information, the Department issued another, more
detailed Notice of Inquiry in the <em>Federal Register </em>on July 18, 1995 (60 FR 36793).  Members of the public
were again invited to submit comments on the Notice of Inquiry.  In a continuing effort to include
stakeholders in predecisional discussions, the Department has developed the proposed Section 180(c)
policy and procedures, presented below, that comprise the Department's proposed approach to
implementing Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  Included in this Notice is a summary of the
comments received from the two prior Notices of Inquiry and the Department's response to those
comments.  The Department welcomes comments in response to this<em> Federal Register</em> notice on the
proposed Section 180(c) policy and procedures.  
<p>
The Department plans to publish, in 1997, a Notice of Final Policy and Procedures that the Department
intends to follow in implementing the Section 180(c) program.  The Section 180(c) program encompasses
the shipment of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to a geologic repository or a monitored
retrievable storage facility pursuant to the NWPA.
<p>
The Department's work to date on the Section 180(c) policy and implementation procedures has been
discussed primarily in Transportation Coordination Group meetings and Transportation External
Coordination (TEC) Working Group meetings.  The Transportation External Working Group will continue
to meet periodically to identify and discuss issues related to the transport of radioactive materials.  In
addition, the Department has ten cooperative agreements with national and regional organizations
representing state, local and tribal constituencies to provide information and solicit input regarding the
transportation aspects of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management program.
<p>
The Department has also released two documents that discuss Section 180(c) policy and implementation.
These two documents are the <em>Strategy for OCRWM to Provide Training Assistance to State, Tribal, and
Local Governments</em> (November 1992, DOE/RW-0374P) (the <em>Strategy</em> document), and the <em>Preliminary
Draft Options for Providing Technical Assistance and Funding Under Section 180(c) of the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act, as Amended</em> (November 1992) (the <em>Options</em> paper).  These documents are available by
requesting the information packet from the OCRWM National Information Center or the Yucca Mountain
Science Center.
<p>
<strong>III.  Proposed Section 180(c) Policy and Procedures</strong>
<p>
<em>Introduction</em>
<p>
This section is divided into four subject areas.  It includes a discussion of the proposed funding
mechanism, definitions of key terms, eligibility and timing of the grants, and allowable activities.  This
proposal is based on information gained by studying industry regulations, legal requirements, and
stakeholder comments.  <em>Funding Mechanism </em>describes the method by which funds would be disbursed to
states and tribes, hereafter referred to as jurisdictions. <em> Definition of Key Terms</em> describes the definition of
safe routine transportation and technical assistance for the purposes of the Section 180(c) program. 
<em>Eligibility and Timing of the Grants Program</em> describes when jurisdictions are eligible and the timing of
the grants process.  <em>Allowable Activities </em>describes the types of activities the funding could be used for as
well as some activities that would be disallowed.  The final policy and procedures may differ based on
comments received on this proposal, any new legislation, and any program and policy changes caused by
new Congressional direction. 
<p>
The Appendix to this Notice provides the cost basis for this proposed Section 180(c) program.
<p>
<em>Funding Mechanism</em>
<p>
The Department intends to implement Section 180(c) through an OCRWM grants program.  Funding
would be provided every year beginning approximately three years prior to the first shipment through a
state or tribal land.  The Department would administer the grants but the grants would be specific to the
Section 180(c) program and would not be combined with any other Department-sponsored transportation
preparedness or training programs, although coordination by jurisdictions would be encouraged.
<p>
The grant program would be administered in accordance with the DOE Financial Assistance rules (10 CFR
600), which implement OMB Circular A-87, Cost Principles for Grants, Contracts and Other Agreements
with Local Governments, OMB Circular A-102, Grants and Cooperative Agreements with State and Local
Governments, and OMB Circular A-128, Audits of State and Local Governments.  In order to preserve
flexibility, the Department does not presently plan to codify the policy and procedures in this notice as
substantive regulations. 
<p>
<em>Definitions of Key Terms</em>
<p>
The definition of safe routine transportation for the purposes of determining eligibility or allowable
activities under the Section 180(c) program would be as follows:
<p><ul>
 <li> <strong>Safe routine transportation </strong>means the enforcement of standards and inspection of shipments of spent
  nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to a repository or an MRS pursuant to the NWPA
  through state, tribal, and local jurisdictions in a manner compliant with applicable Federal, state, tribal,
  and local laws and regulations.  Safe routine highway transportation is characterized by adequate
  vehicle, driver, and package inspection and enforcement of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
  Regulations and the Hazardous Materials Regulations.  Safe routine transportation is also characterized
  by compliance with rail and barge transportation regulations including Federal Railroad
  Administration (FRA) and Coast Guard regulations.
</ul><p>
The definition of technical assistance for the purposes of the Section 180(c) program would be as follows:
<p>
<ul><li> <strong> Technical assistance </strong>means assistance, other than financial assistance, that the Secretary of Energy
  can provide that is unique to the Department to aid training that will cover procedures for the safe,
  routine transportation and emergency response situations during the transport of spent nuclear fuel and
  high-level radioactive waste to a repository or MRS pursuant to the NWPA,  including, but not be
  limited to, the provision of training materials, the provision of public information materials, and access
  to individuals involved in the shipments.
</ul><p>
Technical assistance, as defined, would include access to the Department's regional and headquarters
representatives involved in the planning and operation of NWPA transportation or emergency
preparedness, provision of information packets that include information about the OCRWM program and
shipments, and attendance and support from OCRWM program representatives for public meetings upon
request and consistent with the OCRWM budget.  It would not include the provision of equipment,
although recipients would be able to budget up to ten percent of their allocated funds to purchase
equipment if they chose to do so.
<p>

<em>Eligibility and Timing of the Grants and Technical Assistance Program
</em><p>
The Department intends to provide grants and technical assistance under the Section 180(c) program for
the safe routine transportation of NWPA shipments as these terms are defined above.  The Department
intends that the application process for grants and technical assistance begin approximately four years prior
to transportation (about one year for the application process, about three years to implement the program)
through a jurisdiction.  The Department intends to notify the governor or tribal leader of the jurisdiction
with a letter and information packet, including an application.  The Department intends to calculate the
base amount and variable amount available to each jurisdiction and include that information in the
application package.  The governor or tribal leader would be requested to select one agency or
representative within the jurisdiction to apply for and administer the Section 180(c) grant and technical
assistance.  The administering agency or representative would indicate in the application how it intends to
use its budget.  If funding needs to be passed on to other agencies (for example, from the emergency
services agency to the highway patrol to pay for inspector training) then that would be the responsibility of
the recipient state or tribe.  That information should be identified in the application. 
<p>
Eligible jurisdictions would submit an application to the Department beginning approximately four years
prior to the first shipment through a jurisdiction.  The application would include a three-year plan detailing
how the funds would be spent each year.  Funding would be disbursed annually based on the applicant's
three-year plan.  Each jurisdiction would receive a base amount of funding for each year of eligibility.  A
variable amount of funding, based on route miles, would be available after the first year of eligibility for
those jurisdictions that qualify pursuant to the plan discussed in the Appendix.
<p>
Local governments would not apply for Section 180(c) grants or technical assistance directly.  Local
participation would be coordinated through the state or tribe, if they have subjurisdictions.  However, the
applicant would be required to demonstrate in its plan how the local jurisdictions are benefiting from the
program.  Each jurisdiction would be requested to submit a description of the coordination procedure as
part of its grant application.  This approach builds flexibility into the use of the funds and responds to
commenters' concerns that assistance may not reach the local level.
<p>
The Department anticipates knowing three to four years prior to shipment which states or tribal land the
shipments will travel through, even if routes have not been selected.  Using this information, the
Department would notify these jurisdictions about their potential eligibility for the Section 180(c) program. 
The Department would include in the information to the jurisdiction the total amount of budget it would be
eligible for as determined by the cost estimates described in the Appendix to this Notice.  Two years prior
to the shipments going through a jurisdiction, the Department would announce proposed routes.  
<p>
Within the first year of eligibility to receive funding (Transportation Year [defined as the year that
shipments will commence] minus 3 or TY-3), a base grant would be available.
<p>
Within the second year of eligibility (Transportation Year minus 2 or TY-2), a base grant and a variable
amount of money for those jurisdictions that qualify would be available.  Proposed routes would be
announced during the second year of eligibility.
<p>
Within the third year of eligibility (Transportation Year minus 1 or TY-1), a base grant and a variable
amount of money for those jurisdictions that qualify would be available.  
<p>
A state or tribe would continue to be eligible for and receive Transportation Year grants as long as NWPA
shipments go through its jurisdiction each year.   If there is a lapse of NWPA shipments for three or more
years, the state or tribe would receive no funds for those years and would only regain eligibility three years
prior to another NWPA shipment through its jurisdiction.  Three years prior to the resumption of
shipments through its borders, a state or tribe may again apply for TY-1 grants.  If the lapse is of two years
or less between shipments, the Transportation Year grants would continue as if shipments had been
traversing that jurisdiction during the lapse.
<p>
A significant route change made later than two years prior to the expected start of NWPA shipments
through a jurisdiction could generate some difficulty in administering Section 180(c).  The Section 180(c)
program would include contingencies for changes in schedule and route.  In general, jurisdictions may
receive an additional amount of funding and technical assistance if asked to complete activities in shorter
amounts of time, i.e., a state may receive TY-1 and TY-2 funding in the same year.  If the route change is
made too close to the time of shipment to allow for Section 180(c) preparations, OCRWM may use escorts
with more training and equipment than those currently used for the purpose of safeguards until a
reasonable time period for training has expired.
<p>
<em>Allowable Activities for Funding</em>
<p>
This section describes the types of activities that would be allowed under this proposal and some of the
specific activities that would be disallowed.  This is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but merely a
guide to the types of activities an applicant jurisdiction might consider and some of the activities that
would be considered outside the scope of the program and therefore not eligible for Section 180(c)
funding.
<p>
For the most part, it would be the applicant's decision as to who gets trained, the level of training obtained,
and the organization that administers the training.  Applicants would be encouraged to describe in their
three-year plans how the budget would be integrated with other available training such as that offered
through the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the
Conference on Hazardous Materials Enforcement Development, the state, or regional organizations.  The
application package would request information on how the applicant would use the budget as part of a
larger effort to augment their current infrastructure for safe routine transportation procedures and
emergency response as well as how the applicant anticipates using technical assistance.
<p>
Specifically, an applicant would be able to budget up to ten percent of each year's 180(c) funds to
purchase appropriate (i.e., training-related) equipment provided the equipment is identified in its
application and approved in the grant.
<p>
Funding may be used for refresher training and to train new public safety personnel.  During the years
NWPA transportation is occurring in a jurisdiction (Transportation Year), two-thirds of the budget
provided in TY-1 would help offset the costs of refresher and new personnel training.  The two-thirds
multiplier is a conservative estimate based on the assumption that after the initial training in TY-1 and TY-2, each jurisdiction would experience a personnel turnover rate of approximately two-thirds of its staff
each year.  The turnover of personnel, particularly in the emergency response area, means that new people
will need training if shipments continue through a jurisdiction over an extended period of time.  It would
be the jurisdiction's choice, within the limits of their Section 180(c) annual budget, to determine who
receives refresher training and with what frequency.  It would also be the jurisdiction's choice, within the
limits of its annual Section 180(c) budget, which new personnel receive training and the type and location
of the training.
<p>

Section 180(c) funds would not be available for the conduct of drills and exercises.  The Department
anticipates that it will conduct drills and exercises which will be conducted in conjunction with states,
tribes and local governments in preparation for NWPA shipments.  However, drills and exercises are
generally considered a means to measure preparedness, an activity the Department views as beyond the
scope of the 180(c) program which is limited by statute to provision of funds and technical assistance for
training.
<p>
<strong>IV.  Discussion of Comments Received on the NOIs</strong>
<p>
The Department received 38 comments in response to the January 3, 1995, Notice of Inquiry and an
additional 13 comments in response to the July 18, 1995, Notice of Inquiry:  Supplemental Information. 
Comments were received from the Council of State Governments--Midwestern Office, Council of State
Governments/Eastern Regional Conference, Southern States Energy Board, Western Interstate Energy
Board, two private citizens, Ohio Division of Emergency Medical Services, State of California Department
of Transportation, White Pine County Nuclear Waste Project Office, Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance,
International Association of Fire Fighters, Texas Department of Public Safety, Lander County
Commission, Yakima Indian Nation, Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects, Association of American
Railroads, Nye County Nuclear Waste Repository Project Office, Oregon Department of Energy, State of
Kansas, Eureka County Yucca Mountain Information Office, New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural
Resources Department, National Conference of State Legislatures, County of Inyo Planning Department,
Nuclear Waste Repository Oversight Program, National Congress of American Indians, Conference of
Radiation Control Program Directors, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Lincoln County Nuclear
Waste Project, Nuclear Energy Institute, Vermont Department of Public Service, Commonwealth Edison
Company, Ohio Emergency Management Agency, Clark County Department of Comprehensive Planning,
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, Northern States Power Company, Ohio Emergency Management
Agency, Virginia Power, State of Nebraska Civil Defense Agency and the State of Colorado.  The
commenters held very diverse opinions; no single theme for implementing Section 180(c) was apparent.
<p>
The following section discusses general categories and summarizes major points of the comments and the
Department's response.  
<p>
<em>Major Issues</em>
<p>
<strong>A.  Section 180(c) Policy</strong>
<p>
The commenters raised many topics related to defining a  Section 180(c) policy.  Although the Department
recognizes that these topics are closely related and overlap each other, this section divides those topics into
the following subsections:  general themes for a Section 180(c) program, safe routine transportation,
emergency response procedures, eligibility criteria, funding allocation formula, allowable use of funds,
technical assistance and equipment, and concerns of rural and tribal governments.
<p>
<em>General Themes</em>
<p>
A number of commenters offered ideas about the philosophy and general structure of the 180(c) program. 
These ranged from developing a needs-based type of program to one that offers assistance for an additional
incremental level of training in existing hazardous materials transportation training to cover NWPA
shipments.  An example of comments related to a needs-based program is the Colorado Emergency
Planning Commission recommendation to conduct a risk assessment that balances the likelihood of an
accident, the response capability of the jurisdiction to react, and the likely affected population, then, from
that assessment, identify the preparedness, response, and recovery needs of each jurisdiction.  Similarly,
the Western Governors' Association (WGA), through the Western Interstate Energy Board, submitted
straw man regulations for a program that assesses the current capabilities of jurisdictions, assesses the
needed level of readiness for NWPA shipments, and then provides Section 180(c) assistance to make up
the difference.  WGA suggested that planning grants could be used to fund jurisdictions to complete the
capabilities assessment while implementation grants could be used to carry out the identified activities. 
They recommended the Department fund one national and several regional training advisory committees to
help states and tribes coordinate their training activities.  Most of the comments supporting a needs-based
program either implied or stated the belief that Section 180(c) assistance should cover all costs associated
with the Federal government's transportation of spent nuclear fuel.  
<p>
In contrast, other comments urged the Department to only provide training and assistance as an increment
above what currently exists.  These comments urged the Department to take into account the low level of
risk presented by spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste shipments and proportion the
assistance and training among recipients accordingly.  These commenters maintained that current
hazardous materials transportation training for safe routine and emergency response procedures is
sufficient to handle any transportation radiological accident that may occur.  Creating a Section 180(c)
program that goes beyond current hazardous materials transportation training would send a message that
the NWPA shipments are more hazardous than they really are.  Still other commenters stated that nuclear
utilities will, in effect, pay twice for emergency response and safe routine practices through contributions
to the Nuclear Waste Fund, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act fees for
transporters of hazardous material, and through various state and local fee assessments and programs. 
<p>
Other recurring comments urged the Department to either not ship or to limit the number of shipments
until a Section 180(c) program is in place.  This comment was frequently presented in conjunction with the
belief that the Department has an obligation to accept waste in 1998, and if Congress identifies a storage
facility, shipping may well begin in 1998 or shortly thereafter.  In addition, these commenters urged the
Department to accelerate Section 180(c) implementation and to ask for a Section 180(c) budget allocation
in the 1996 budget request to Congress. 
<p>
Several commenters encouraged the Department to begin as soon as possible the process of route selection,
in cooperation with the states, to give jurisdictions sufficient time to assess their training needs.  They
argued that jurisdictions need to know what routes will be used so that they may begin planning
immediately for shipments and be prepared if shipping occurs within the next few years.
<p>
<em>Response</em>
<p>
 It is the Department's position that the purpose of a Section 180(c) program is to provide jurisdictions
assistance in an increment above their current level of preparedness rather than to supply complete
emergency response or safe routine transportation capabilities along NWPA transportation routes.  Other
Federal agencies such as FEMA and the Department of Transportation, as part of their respective missions,
assist states and tribes in the creation of more comprehensive emergency response and safe routine
transportation capabilities.  Therefore, this proposal is designed to provide incremental assistance, above
what currently exists, to help jurisdictions prepare for NWPA shipments.  This program, in combination
with the Department's emergency response capabilities, will help jurisdictions train for these shipments
and increase their preparedness level. 
<p>
While the Department has not adopted the Western Governor's Association straw man regulations
specifically, the Department's proposal would allow states and tribes the flexibility to implement many
provisions of the straw man regulations as they choose.  The Department's proposed technical assistance
would help provide the planning and coordination called for in the straw man regulations at a reasonable
cost to the program.  In addition, the proposed training advisory groups could drain financial assistance
away from recipient jurisdictions.  Training up to two years prior to shipments will provide inspectors and
emergency responders with current information about the NWPA shipments.
<p>
Regarding the concern that shipments will occur with less than three years' preparation, this proposed
policy includes a contingency plan should the Department have to ship spent fuel through a jurisdiction
with less than three years notice.  In addition, the Department will work with jurisdictions on a case-by-case basis to meet the intent of Section 180(c) prior to any shipments through a jurisdiction.  
<p>
Regarding the comments that the Department should request Section 180(c) funding in fiscal year 1996
and announce routes as soon as possible, funding requests for Section 180(c) and a determination of routes
cannot be completed until a destination and initial shipping date have been identified. 
<p>
<em>Safe routine transportation</em>
<p>
Commenters offered several suggestions concerning the definition of safe routine transportation as used in
180(c).  Four commenters specifically supported the Transportation External Coordination Working Group
definition while other commenters wrote more expansive definitions to include combinations of alternate
route analysis, inspection and enforcement training, en route contingency plans, transportation
infrastructure improvements, shipment notification and tracking, escorts, public information, and
development and distribution of training curricula and course materials.  The Western Governor's
Association straw man regulations would add record-keeping audits, operating protocols, and improving
confidence in the shipping package to the definition.
<p>
A number of viewpoints were expressed on inspections as part of safe routine transportation activities.  For
example, the Public Utility Commission of Ohio stated that safe routine transportation includes more than
inspections and should include detailed carrier and shipper compliance reviews pursuant to 49 CFR 100-177 requirements.  The Department was also encouraged to develop inspection standards for rail transport
serving the same purpose as the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance's enhanced inspection standards for
truck shipments.  
<p>
Regarding the relative emphasis and scope of safe routine transportation activities, the Council of State
Governments -- Midwestern Office and the Public Utility Commission of Ohio recommended placing
equal emphasis on safe routine transportation activities as on emergency response activities.  In contrast,
the Ohio Emergency Management Agency recommended placing more emphasis on emergency response
activities.  One commenter said Section 180(c) assistance should fully fund state costs for state inspections
and escorts related to NWPA shipments.
<p>
The need for and training of escorts was also a topic.  The Conference of Radiation Control Program
Directors questioned the need for escorts as an expensive option considering the actual level of risk
compared to other hazardous material shipments.  Two commenters called for the Department to examine
the possibility of either state or Federal response teams traveling with the shipments to reduce the need for
local first-responder training.
<p>
A global positioning system for shipment tracking was encouraged as a way to build trust in the safety of
the shipments and work more closely with the corridor jurisdictions.
<p>
<em>Response</em>
<p>
The definition of safe routine transportation proposed in this notice combines part of the TEC definition
and the Strategy document definition.  The complete TEC definition was not used because it is very broad
and does not indicate specifically what training for safe routine transportation activities would be covered
by Section 180(c) assistance.  Many activities suggested in the comments are already required of the
shipper or carrier such as developing operating protocols and using escorts.  This negates the need to
include the activities in the definition of safe routine transportation for the purposes of providing Section
180(c) assistance.  Some other requested activities, such as alternate route analysis and record-keeping
audits, are outside the realm of training for safe transport of NWPA shipments, and therefore not included
in the definition. 
<p>
Regarding the comments that the Department should develop rail inspection standards, the Department
representatives will work cooperatively with the railroad companies and the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) on inspection and enforcement matters.  Both the rail companies and the FRA have
stringent standards for the transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste.  The
Department has no plans to develop rail inspection criteria.
<p>
The proposed policy permits enough flexibility that a recipient jurisdiction may distribute the money
between training for emergency response procedures and safe routine transportation procedures as they
choose.  Again, this proposal is intended to assist jurisdictions to incrementally increase their level of
preparedness for NWPA shipments.  However, the Department maintains the position that to pay for all
costs associated with state inspections and escorts is beyond the scope of the Section 180(c) program and is
not necessary for shipment safety. 
<p>
These shipments will be made in accordance with NRC safeguards and security requirements.  The issue of
whether escorts must be used is partially answered by NRC regulations, which require escorts (10 CFR
73.37). 
<p>
<em>Emergency response procedures</em>
<p>
The comments on providing assistance for emergency response training procedures were particularly
varied. In keeping with the needs-based approach to assistance, a number of commenters recommended
funding planning activities to determine the type and amount of training.   These suggestions include
Departmental delineation of the roles and responsibilities of each jurisdiction in an emergency response
situation and assistance to each jurisdiction in carrying out that role; funding to jurisdictions to conduct
route and risk assessments prior to deciding whom to train and to what standards; or using the State
Emergency Response Commissions and the Local Emergency Planning Committees as points of contact to
decide who should receive assistance and to determine the needed level of training.
<p>
Various training standards for different levels of responders were also suggested.  These included
awareness training for local first-responders and higher-level training for more specialized responders,
refresher training for first-responders, maintenance of on-call systems for radiological responders, and
periodic exercises for personnel responding to accidents.  The Western Governor's Association straw man
regulations recommended the above activities plus accident notification, safe parking procedures,
equipping personnel responding to NWPA accidents, development and/or revision of courses and course
materials, and assessing opportunities to coordinate training, emergency response, and exercises.  One
commenter praised the emergency response training at the Department's Nevada Test Site and asked that it
be used for Section 180(c) funded training. 
<p>
A frequent comment supported integration of emergency response training for local public safety officials
into existing hazardous materials training because the response requirements for radiological incidents fall
within the requirements for other hazardous materials shipments.
<p>
The Council of State Governments -- Midwestern Office asserted that current capabilities at the state, tribal
and local level are inadequate in most jurisdictions to handle the number and frequency of planned
OCRWM shipments.  In contrast, two other commenters recommended only incremental assistance to first-responders because current Departmental resources can support any incident that may occur during
transport.
<p>
Comments on training for hospital personnel ranged from the need to provide awareness training to
specialized decontamination equipment and training.  Two commenters argued that training for hospital
personnel was not necessary at all.  The Council of State Governments/Eastern Regional Conference said
assistance was not necessary for hospitals because the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care
Organizations requires hospitals to be able to treat patients exposed to radioactive contamination before
receiving their accreditation.
<p>
<em>Response</em>
<p>
This proposed policy is flexible enough that a recipient jurisdiction could conduct many of the suggested
activities.  The Department recognizes the need for clear lines of responsibility and communication during
a transportation emergency and anticipates working with recipient jurisdictions on these matters through
the provision of technical assistance and, as budget allows, by conducting exercises and drills.  While
exercises and drills, will be conducted separately from the Section 180(c) program, the assistance may be
used to support participation in, or observation of, exercises and drills if the recipient jurisdiction desires. 
Similarly, reliance on the State Emergency and Response Commissions and Local Emergency Planning
Committees infrastructure will be left to the applicant jurisdiction's discretion.  This proposal does not
allow Section 180(c) assistance to be used to conduct route and risk assessments because these activities
are outside the scope of training for emergency response and safe routine transportation activities. 
<p>
Regarding the specific activities allowed under this proposal, each jurisdiction will be allowed to choose
the training they wish and to train the public safety personnel of their choosing.  The funding provided is
intended to defray the costs of attending advanced courses such as those offered by the Department.  In
many cases, the applicants will have their own less expensive training programs (FEMA and the
Department do not charge tuition, although this proposal uses the cost of tuition as a basis of the estimate
for the cost of each trainee) and may use the remaining assistance for other activities related to training for
safe routine and emergency response transportation procedures.
<p>
The Department will provide awareness training materials for local responders and public information
material to the recipient jurisdictions.  For more advanced training courses, it is expected the recipient
jurisdictions will either use their own training courses, if available, or attend existing hazardous materials
or radiological emergency response classes.  Equipment will not be provided for directly, but up to ten
percent of a recipient's funds may be used to purchase equipment of the recipient's choosing.  Again, the
basis of estimate in the proposal does not explicitly provide for training hospital personnel, but recipient
jurisdictions may use their funds for this purpose if they choose.  The Department's awareness materials
will include information about Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Radiological Emergency Assistance
Center and Training Site and its 24-hour on-call assistance.
<p>
Regarding the preparedness level of state and tribal jurisdictions, the Department understands that there are
greatly varying levels of preparedness.  The financial and technical assistance provided through this
proposed program, in combination with the Department's resources, will assist recipient jurisdictions to
incrementally increase their level of preparedness for NWPA shipments.   The Department will work with
a jurisdiction to provide information about the shipments, the safety precautions taken, and the
Department's resources to assist the jurisdiction in case of an accident or incident.
<p>
<em>Eligibility criteria</em>
<p>
Comments on eligibility criteria focused on which jurisdictional level should be eligible to apply for funds.
Some argued that if local governments were eligible to receive funds directly, then this would reduce
administrative costs and give local governments more control over the assistance.  Several counties simply
requested that they be guaranteed an amount of budget and given some discretion in using the assistance.
Other commenters said only state and tribal agencies are eligible to apply for assistance.  Some
commenters made suggestions regarding how the timing of NWPA shipments through a jurisdiction
impacts eligibility. The WGA straw man regulations defined an eligible state or tribe as "a host(s) and
corridor states or Indian tribes through which shipments under the NWPA are planned within six years." 
Others said training should begin from one to three years prior to shipment.  

One commenter said that eligibility should not be restricted by waste type or destination, but rather should
help local governments prepare for all types of hazardous materials transportation emergencies.


The point was also raised that tribes and states near, but not on, transportation routes should be eligible for
assistance, since their lands and people would be at risk in case of a transportation accident or incident. 
Another commenter disagreed, saying that only jurisdictions traversed by NWPA shipments should be
eligible for assistance.

Response

The Department based its proposed requirements for eligibility on the wording in the NWPA and the
Department's prior discussions with stakeholders about beginning assistance three-to-five years prior to
commencement of shipping through a jurisdiction.  The statute provides that state governments determine
how best to allocate the assistance to local jurisdictions. The Department plans to assist tribal governments
directly unless requested otherwise by the tribal government.  Recipients will be required to encourage
local government participation in planning and training and to provide awareness training materials and
public information supplied by the Department to local public safety officials along the shipment routes.  
<p>
The Department does not propose to use the Western Governor's Association straw man regulations
indicating that eligible jurisdictions should receive assistance six years prior to transportation.  Since states
and tribes have primary responsibility to plan for hazardous materials transportation through their
jurisdictions regardless of Federal shipments, and given the high rate of turnover among emergency
response personnel, the Department believes that assistance provided so far in advance of shipments would
not be effective.  
<p>
In response to the request to provide assistance regardless of destination or type of waste, Section 180(c)
provides that assistance is only available for those jurisdictions through whom the Secretary [of Energy]
plans to ship spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste to a repository or MRS under the NWPA. 
Assistance will not be provided to jurisdictions that do not have NWPA shipments through their borders,
nor will assistance be provided for other types of wastes.  
<p>
<i>Funding allocation formula</i>
<p>
Once eligibility criteria are determined, the total assistance available will have to be allocated among the
eligible parties.  Commenters were explicit in their views of how funds should be allocated.  A frequent
comment was that funds should be allocated according to the shipment miles through a jurisdiction. The
Western Governor's Association defined shipment miles as the product of the expected number of
shipments multiplied by the distance of such shipments.  The Western Governor's Association straw man
regulations recommended annual implementation grants of 75% of the funds allocated according to
shipment miles and 25% allocated to ensure minimum funding levels and program capabilities. The
Nuclear Energy Institute countered that the number of shipment miles through a jurisdiction does not
automatically result in greater impact to a jurisdiction and therefore should not qualify them for additional
assistance.  
<p>
Other commenters suggested funding be allocated to each eligible jurisdiction based on a formula that
includes both the number of route miles in the jurisdiction and the population at risk along the shipment
route(s), with consideration given to existing capabilities, and to the number of shipments.  Population was
frequently mentioned as a valid determinant of funding allocations.  Several commenters stated that there
should be a base level of funding for each jurisdiction.
<p>
The Council of State Governments--Midwestern Office and Commonwealth Edison Company
recommended that the Department consult with recipients to determine their funding level based on the
impact of the shipments to that jurisdiction.  The Council of State Governments /Eastern Regional
Conference said the funds for first-responders should be proportional to the number of responders along a
route and the funding available for inspectors should be a function of the number of shipments.
<p>
The Texas Department of Public Safety recommended using the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act
Training and Planning Grants approach to allocating funds. 
<p>
<em>Response</em>
<p>
The Department agrees with many commenters that a base level of assistance should be available to all
jurisdictions to be crossed by NWPA shipments.  Number of shipments was not used as a determinant of
funding level because training of safety officials is required no matter how many shipments cross their
jurisdiction.  A jurisdiction may need additional inspectors as the number of shipments increases. 
Population was not used to determine funding levels because the same level of effort is required in
responding to an emergency no matter how many people may be affected.
<p>
The Department does not foresee working with each eligible jurisdiction to determine assistance levels
because the number of eligible jurisdictions in a given year would make such an interactive process
prohibitively costly, lengthy and administratively burdensome.  It would require significant resources from
both the Department and the applicant with little or no increased level of safety.  Jurisdictions will be able
to obtain guidance from Department representatives to determine how best to allocate the funds and what
type of training to obtain. 
<p>
The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act model for fund allocation has merit but the Department
believes the allocation method proposed in this Notice is more appropriate to a Section 180(c) program.
The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act program has virtually the same number of eligible
jurisdictions from year to year whereas the Section 180(c) program may have large annual variations in the
number of eligible jurisdictions.  The funding allocation method proposed in the appendix of this Notice
would allow the Department to prepare its draft annual budget request based on anticipated needs for each
year of shipment.   Finally, both the Department and some commenters maintain that the reimbursement
aspect of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act is not appropriate for a Section 180(c) program.
<p>
<em>Allowable use of funds</em>
<p>
Elements of this discussion overlap with the discussion of program scope and the definitions of key terms.
Several state agencies and organizations said that states and tribes should prioritize their own training
needs.  They argued that the Department must balance accountability with an applicant's need for latitude
in deciding how to spend funds because of the varying levels of preparedness, divisions of responsibility,
and other differences.  Commenters suggested the Department could help recipient jurisdictions by
supplying information and expertise to help beneficiaries determine how best to use the funds.
<p>
Many commenters, however, said that the final allocation of funding should guarantee a specific portion of
the funding for local governments to use as they see best.  Other suggestions were to give local
governments explicit standing on any planning, training or advisory groups formed as a result of Section
180(c), to reserve a certain percentage of the funds for distribution to local governments, and to require
recipients to notify local governments of the program and to encourage their participation.  One commenter
objected to exclusively funding training for local governments and excluding training for state personnel
and recommended the Department check the intent of Congress in this regard.
<p>
Other commenters argued that the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act grant program provides a good
model for allowable activities.  These regulations require recipient jurisdictions to describe existing
programs and explain how the requested funds supply necessary improvements to the existing capabilities.
They also provide for monitoring of the program's effectiveness.  The Department's Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant (WIPP) assistance program was also mentioned as a successful model to help determine allowable
activities.
<p>
Two states said that Section 180(c) assistance should pay for infrastructure improvements along routes. 
Another frequently mentioned point was that the Section 180(c) program should not require any matching
funds from the jurisdiction in order to receive assistance.  The Western Governor's Association straw man
regulations provide that the funds be distributed for training along specific shipment routes, unlike FEMA
programs that work to enhance overall preparedness.  Several comments recommended that exercises and
drills be funded by Section 180(c) assistance, either to test the adequacy of the training or to determine the
training needed.
<p>
<em>Response</em>
<p>
The Department's proposal would allow states and tribes to determine their own training needs as long as
it is in accordance with their current public safety infrastructure.  The Department took this approach
because it allows maximum flexibility for applicants to tailor the assistance to their priorities.  Because of
the need for flexibility, the proposal does not require applicants to provide a guaranteed percentage of
funds to local public safety officials.  The Department's existing grants process under 10 CFR Part 600
would provide for accountability with 10 CFR Part 600 without being too cumbersome for the Department
or the applicants and would allow Department representatives to provide advice and answer questions.  We
do not intend to request matching funds because most commenters and the Department found no basis for
such a requirement and there is no legal requirement for matching funds.
<p>
The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act and WIPP examples for allowable use of funds both have
merit.  If a jurisdiction wishes to follow the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act or WIPP example in
prioritizing use of their grant monies, that would be described in the grant application.  Similarly,
recipients may decide to provide funds only along a route or throughout their jurisdiction as they choose. 
Recipients would not be prevented from using the assistance to participate in, or observe, exercises and
drills but they are not included in the Department's proposed basis for estimating funding levels.
<p>
Section 180(c) authorizes assistance only for training.  Therefore, the Department does not intend to allow
the use of 180(c) funds for infrastructure improvements. 
<p>
<em>Technical assistance and equipment</em>
<p>
Almost every comment that addressed the issue of technical assistance identified the need for equipment. 
Some commenters suggested that the Department use the Transportation External Coordination Working
Group definition of technical assistance.  Another suggested using the Department's 1992 Draft Options
Paper definition.   The Council of State Governments -- Midwestern Office offered the following
definition, "The term  technical assistance' as it is used in Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
means a variety of activities designed to ensure that state, tribal and local governments are trained for safe
routine transportation practices as well as responding to transportation emergencies within their
jurisdictions, including but not limited to planning guidance, training support, practical support, funding of
pre-identified equipment, and expertise."  They also believe the Department should supply funding for
equipment, its maintenance and calibration, and that states should have funding to purchase computer
software and hardware to assist with monitoring and response activities.
<p>
New Mexico specifically stated it preferred the TEC definition's greater specificity and clarity over the
definition offered by the Council of State Governments -- Midwestern Office.  "However, [it]
recommend[ed] two revisions to the definition: 1) The first sentence should read  ...to ensure that States
and tribal governments are trained for safe routine transportation practices as well as capable of responding
safely and effectively to spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste transportation emergencies with their
jurisdictions.'  2) The second sentence should read  ...and for public information, outreach, and
participation efforts.' " 
<p>
Other suggestions were broader in their application, encompassing such things as emergency response
equipment, inspection equipment, assistance in route planning, emergency response plan development,
course development and exercises, tracking capability, equipment and training for hospital personnel,
24-hour access to Federal radiological safety personnel, carrier qualifications, and funding, among others.
<p>
The Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors questioned the need for equipment, especially for
local responders. They argued that the low risk of these shipments does not justify a response capability
beyond what currently exists.  FEMA, on the other hand, offered its assistance to the Department in
providing technical assistance and equipment to responders through its role as provider of emergency and
disaster preparedness for state, tribal, and local governments.
<p>
<em>Response</em>
<p>
The definition of technical assistance proposed in this Notice combines parts of the Strategy definition and
the Transportation External Coordination Working Group definition.  The bulk of the Transportation
External Coordination Working Group definition was not included because many of the activities listed,
such as assistance in route planning, maintaining equipment, providing on-site emergency response
assistance, and remediation assistance are outside the scope of training and therefore not covered by
Section 180(c).  The Department has resources already available, upon request of the state or tribe, to
provide monitoring and recovery advice if there has been an accident or incident.  In addition, the shipper
and carrier can provide shipment-specific assistance. 
<p>
The definition in this proposal allows for Department representatives to provide technical support on
training needs and response strategies as budget constraints allow.  As explained in the proposal, conduct
of drills and exercises are not included under the definition of technical assistance although it is anticipated
that the NWPA transportation staff, or DOE representatives, may, as budget allows, conduct exercises and
drills with state, local, and tribal jurisdictions along the transportation routes. 
<p>
<em>Concerns of rural and tribal governments</em>
<p>
Few additional comments that dealt specifically with the concerns of rural and tribal governments were
received in response to the July 18, Notice of Inquiry.  Both New Mexico and the Council of State
Governments--Midwestern Office reiterated the Department's responsibility to work with tribes on a
government-to-government basis.  Other comments stressed the Department's Trust responsibility towards
tribal governments.  One comment encouraged the Department to begin direct communications with tribal
governments near reactor locations to address their particular concerns. The Department was also
encouraged to contact tribal governments who may not know they could have NWPA shipments crossing
their lands.
<p>
Commenters encouraged the Department to take extra steps to address the lack of infrastructure and
resources on many of the tribal lands that will be crossed by NWPA shipments.  Recommendations
included providing resources to allow tribes to participate in the OCRWM program and beginning early to
build an emergency response infrastructure for those tribes lacking basic infrastructure. One comment
urged expansion of the cooperative agreement with the National Congress of American Indians to help
facilitate communication with tribal governments.
<p>
Other commenters suggested how a Section 180(c) program could address the concerns specific to rural
areas. Rural jurisdictions often rely heavily on volunteer public safety personnel with high turnover rates,
serve large areas with few staff, have few resources for training, with little or no ability to travel to obtain
training. The commenters encouraged the Department to offer training in the communities where the local
responders reside and to guarantee that certain levels of training and equipment would be supplied.
<p>
<em>Response</em>
<p>
The Department recognizes that there is a lack of infrastructure and trained personnel on many tribal lands
and in many rural counties across the nation.  Typically, these areas may rely more heavily on technical
assistance than other recipient jurisdictions.  As stated earlier, the Department believes that a jurisdiction's
lack of emergency response infrastructure does not compromise shipment safety when a jurisdiction is
aware of the steps taken to ensure safety and the Department's readiness to provide on-site assistance.  The
basic awareness training modules will be provided to jurisdictions to distribute to responders along each
shipping route and will not require public safety officials to travel outside their jurisdiction.  These training
modules will inform local public safety officials of what steps to take in case of a transportation emergency
in their jurisdiction and what staff will be traveling with the shipments that can be a source of information
and assistance. 
<p>
The Department has agreed to work directly with tribal governments unless requested otherwise by the
applicant.  As far as working with tribes located near reactors sites, the Department will continue to work
through the mechanism of its cooperative agreement with the National Congress of American Indians to
reach out to tribes across the nation and encourage their participation in the program.
<p>
<strong>B. Section 180(c) Procedures</strong>
<p>
The comments received from both Notices showed a preference among the commenters for an OCRWM
grants program.  While twelve commenters recommended a Department or OCRWM grants program, eight
commenters supported the next most popular option, the use of existing Federal programs.  Of these, four
recommended using FEMA, two recommended the Department of Transportation's Hazardous Materials
Transportation Act program, and two recommended other Federal programs.  At the same time, eight
commenters specifically criticized the use of existing Federal programs.  Three commenters either
requested a combination of options or expressed moderate support for a combination of options; one
commenter said this was not viable.  Three commenters were opposed to disbursing the funds through
cooperative agreements, whereas eight commenters said cooperative agreements were either a very good
idea or gave conditional support for the idea.  Several commenters identified a preferred option but also
listed other options as acceptable.
<p>
The most common theme among the comments on procedural options was the importance of minimizing
the administrative burden on all parties.  Another common theme was to limit the layers of bureaucracy
and administration through which funding must pass.
<p>
The following describes more detailed comments provided about each option.
<p>
Use established federal agency programs other than the Department's
<p>
The Council of State Governments/Eastern Regional Conference, the Ohio Emergency Management
Agency, the Texas Department of Public Safety, Division of Emergency Management and FEMA all
commented that receiving additional assistance through FEMA's Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement
program (to be replaced with the Performance Partnership Agreements beginning in FY96) would be the
least administratively burdensome since they already participate in this FEMA program.  The Council of
State Governments--Midwestern Office commented that FEMA should be a vehicle for assistance only
after the Department and the recipient have agreed to use FEMA for that recipient.  The Hazardous
Materials Transportation Act grant program was mentioned by the Nuclear Energy Institute and Northern
States Power Company as a desirable option to reduce multiple Federal programs and the chance that
utilities would pay twice for emergency response through hazardous materials transportation fees and the
Nuclear Waste Fund.
<p>
FEMA provided descriptions of their current regulatory authority to monitor and assess emergency
management plans and preparedness, and a proposal for how they could administer the Section 180(c)
program.  FEMA discussed its current training programs and expertise in the emergency management field
and stressed its all-hazards approach to preparedness that includes radioactive materials shipments within
the larger scope of emergency preparedness.
<p>
The most common concern from the state and county perspective was that other Federal programs would
add administrative layers and reduce the funds available for the recipients.  The Western Interstate Energy
Board, in particular, felt that FEMA was not an appropriate avenue because "FEMA's Comprehensive
Cooperative Agreement program has been the subject of substantial disagreement with several western
states and is viewed by experts in our region as ineffective and inappropriate for dealing with spent nuclear
fuel or high-level radioactive waste."  In fact, one commenter criticized FEMA for placing emphasis on
preparations for nuclear attacks rather than transportation incidents.  The Hazardous Materials
Transportation Act and FRA programs were seen as too narrowly focused to work well as a vehicle to
implement a Section 180(c) program. 
<p>
From the tribal perspective, the most common critique of other Federal programs was that none of the
options discussed in the Notices has an effective mechanism in place to work with tribes.  Commenters
advocated exploration of other funding mechanisms that tribes use more frequently, such as the
Department of Housing and Urban Development Community Development and Block Grant Program, and
suggested establishing a separate funding mechanism for tribal governments.  
<p>
Other commenters were concerned that using other Federal programs would diminish focus on NWPA
shipment safety and increase impacts from government downsizing.  The Commercial Vehicle Safety
Association also pointed out that it may put expertise and training further away from the intended delivery
point.
<p>
<em>Establish agreements with state, local, tribal, and other organizations</em>
<p>
This option prompted a variety of interpretations.  Agreements or Memoranda of Understanding among
recipients, agreements between the Department and recipients, or agreements between the Department and
regional or national coordinating organizations were all discussed.  Some identified the potential
improvements in regional cooperation and efficiency as the biggest benefit to establishing agreements with
regional or national organizations.  One commenter suggested cooperative agreements would allow
negotiations each year between recipients and the Department that would permit adjustment among
recipients' with dissimilar training goals.  The Colorado Emergency Planning Commission said
consideration should be given to working through the WGA or a similar organization to promote
coordination.  The Commission suggested that WIPP's cooperative agreement with WGA could be a
useful mechanism to mimic.
<p>
Expanding the cooperative agreement with the National Congress of American Indians was recommended
as a possible way to ensure up front consultation with tribal recipients.  Such expansion of cooperative
agreements with tribes could balance the differences between tribes and other recipients governments.
<p>
Many commenters, however, saw the development of cooperative agreements as a lengthy, involved
process that could take too long to implement effectively.  Two commenters specifically noted the WIPP
cooperative agreements worked well because there was a smaller group of participants and it was
developed over several years.  NWPA requirements may not be compatible with this experience.  This
option was criticized for creating an unnecessary administrative layer that would take away from total
funding to be spent on training.
<p> 
Other comments encouraged cooperative agreements with organizations that could, in turn, train state,
local and tribal public safety officials. The Association of American Railroads' Technical Training Center
in Pueblo, Colorado and the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance were both identified as organizations
with the capability to train recipients for emergency response for rail incidents and for truck inspections,
respectively. 
<p>
<em>Establish a Department-wide grant program</em>
<p>
Response to this option was mixed.  Some called a Department-wide program inappropriate, citing the
difficulty of co-mingling Nuclear Waste Fund money with other Department transportation activities. 
Commenters expressed concern over coordinating the diverse shipping campaigns of the Department in a
timely manner.  Supporting this option, one commenter noted that the fewer points-of-contact between the
Department and stakeholders would be beneficial.
<p><em>
</em>Establish an OCRWM grant program
<p>
Many commenters saw this as the best option, listing such benefits as minimizing bureaucracy and
administration and increasing flexibility.   Some commented on the benefit of distributing Section 180(c)
assistance without involving other programs as would happen through a Department-wide grant program. 
Others noted that an OCRWM grant program would more easily adjust to the diversity and number of
recipient jurisdictions and thus, Department control and accountability would be easier.
<p>
The Western Interstate Energy Board commented on this option favorably, provided that such a grant
program incorporates flexibility to allow states to coordinate the training and funding. The Southern States
Energy Board and the National Conference of State Legislatures both identified this option as favorable if
additional national or regional coordination efforts were also supported.
<p>
Many county commenters interpreted this option as similar to the direct payments made to local
governments through Yucca Mountain oversight programs. They were generally in favor of options that
assist local governments as directly as possible.
<p>
<em>Use elements from the previous four groups</em>
<p>
Three commenters agreed that a combination of options would be best because it could provide the proper
degree of direct contact between the Department and recipient governments while encouraging national or
regional planning, coordination, and uniformity.  The Council of State Governments--Midwestern Office
said the Department should negotiate with the recipients to provide assistance through a variety of
mechanisms "to accommodate the needs of as many states and tribes as possible."  Commonwealth Edison
Company concurred with the Council of State Government's opinion.  The Southern States Energy Board
recommended using a combination of direct grants to states and tribes with cooperative agreements to
regional organizations to provide coordination and consultation.  
<p> 
<em>Response</em>
<p>
This proposal recommends distributing funds through an OCRWM grants program because the
Department believes this is the most flexible, least administratively burdensome and least costly method of
all the procedural options investigated.  This mechanism will allow the greatest amount of appropriated
funds to be distributed directly to the recipients rather than diverted to cover administrative costs. 
Distributing the funds through a grant program rather than a cooperative agreement program lowers the
cost of administration for both recipients and the Department, and gives the recipients more discretion in
use of the funds.  Under the proposed policy, recipients would have a great deal of flexibility in use of the
grants and could account for varying levels of preparedness.  
<p>
The Department did not choose to implement Section 180(c) through another Federal program for many of
the same reasons commenters were critical of this option.  While the FEMA option may have been flexible
enough to meet the requirements of a Section 180(c) program, the time and effort to set up a program at
another agency would have increased administrative cost, decreased the program's flexibility and reduced
the funds available for recipients.  Since the Department can perform the same function, there is no reason
to involve another agency.  The Department of Transportation programs were not similar enough to the
requirements for a Section 180(c) program and would have required significant effort to meld the programs
together.
<p>
A Department-wide grants program would require overcoming difficult legal and logistical problems.  The
logistical problems of creating one Department-wide emergency response and safe routine transportation
grants program for all eligible recipients would require extensive administrative work.  It would also likely
create legal and procedural paperwork tangles to keep from mingling the appropriations for various
programs within the Department.  As long as the various Department offices cooperate on an informal
basis, there appears to be little benefit to formally combining programs.  
<p>
Combining elements of each option was not selected because it would create logistic difficulties and would
not be very efficient or cost effective.  For example, if the Department sent some recipients' assistance
through the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act program, some through FEMA, and some directly
from the Department, it would significantly increase the administrative costs, increase oversight and
accountability problems and create a very confusing and disjointed program for both the Department and
the recipients.  
<p>
<strong>C. Applicability of Section 180(c) to Private Shipments</strong>
<p>
Many states, counties, and regional groups urged that the Section 180(c) program should apply to all
commercial spent nuclear fuel or defense high-level radioactive waste shipments ultimately destined for an
NWPA facility, whether or not those shipments are transported to and stored on an interim basis at a
private facility.  Commenters cited that any large-scale shipping campaign of such materials will have
virtually the same impact on states and tribes as that envisioned in the NWPA.
<p>
<em>Response</em>
<p>
The Department is currently authorized to implement the Section 180(c) program of financial and technical
assistance only for shipments to a repository or MRS constructed under the NWPA. However, the many
comments on this issue have been noted.
<p>
<strong>D. Policy Development Process</strong>
<p>
A few commenters questioned the Department's plans to issue a Notice of Policy and Procedures rather
than establish the program in regulations.  They voiced concern that implementation of Section 180(c)
through regulations is necessary to ensure stability through changes of leadership within the Department
and that an interpretation of policy and procedures is "less robust."  An expedited rulemaking process was
suggested to accommodate time constraints.
<p>
<em>Response</em>
<p>
The Department is developing the Policy and Procedures after receipt and consideration of extensive
public comments.  At some future date, the Department may decide to promulgate regulations.  At this
time, however, it is the Department's intent to remain flexible in order to work through unforeseen
problems without committing to binding regulations.
<p>
<strong>V.  Conclusion and Request for Submission</strong>
<p>
This paper has presented the Department's proposal for a policy and procedures for the Section 180(c)
program.  It has also presented the Department's summarization of and response to comments received on
prior Notices of Inquiry about  Section 180(c) policy and procedures.  Comments on this proposal will be
included in the Notice of Final Policy and Procedures, which the Department intends to publish in 1997. 
The purpose of this document has been to share with stakeholders the progress to date on developing
Section 180(c) policy and procedures and to request additional comments from interested parties.  The
final policy and procedures may reflect changes as a result of comments, new Congressional direction, and
any policy changes caused by the new Congressional direction. 
<p>
The Department solicits comments from the public on this proposal to issue Section 180(c) policy and
procedures.

<h4>                          Appendix
<p>
                   Basis for Cost of Program</h4>
<p>
To determine the cost of the program and a feasible approach to allocate funding among eligible
participants, the Department intends to estimate reasonable activities that could be achieved each year to
use, not as prescribed activities for the applicants, but to determine the dollar amount of the grant each
recipient should receive.   Since the Department has found no industry or regulatory standards on what
constitutes a sufficient emergency response to a spent fuel transportation accident, it expects to rely on
training standards and regulations (discussed below) to reach conclusions about what type of training
would be reasonable.  To reach conclusions with regard to which and how many people should be trained
and to what levels, the Department intends to look at industry regulations, the Department's own
capabilities to support state and tribal governments, and the comments provided by stakeholders.  Based on
the information from these sources, the Department intends to determine the activities on which it would
base its grant allocations and then estimate the costs for these activities.
<p>
The training standards the Department intends to use for emergency response are consistent with the level
of training recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (Safety Series No. 87,
1988), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) (29 CFR 1910.120) and the National
Fire Protection Association (NFPA) (NFPA 471 and 472).  The training standards we intend to use for safe
routine transportation are consistent with current practices and the regulatory limitations placed on states
and tribes for safe routine transportation activities.   Recognizing that not everyone will agree with this
application of the standards to the training goals, there would be few limitations on how the recipient
actually spends its budget, as long as they are used for training related to safe routine transportation of
spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste and emergency response procedures.
<p>
The training goals for both safe routine transportation and emergency response procedures that the
Department intends to use as a basis for determining a grant allocation are as follows:
<p>
<em>Emergency Response </em>
 <ul><li> First-on-scene and first responder personnel:  Self-directed awareness training material would be
  supplied by the Department.  The Department-provided awareness material would include information
  for medical personnel.  Up to two people from each state or tribe would be funded to attend train-the-trainer classes of the jurisdiction's choice to teach the classroom awareness training to first-responders. 
  Section 180(c) funding would partially offset the cost of in-state training.
<p>
<li>  State/tribal hazardous materials or radiological response:  Up to three people would receive funding to
  attend more specialized training, selected by the jurisdiction.  Additional personnel may be trained,
  depending on route miles.
<p>
<li>  Transportation Public Information:  Another one person from each state or tribe would be funded to
  attend public information training (such as that offered at the Nevada Test Site [NTS]).
</ul><p>
<em>Safe Routine Transportation </em>
<ul><li>  State/tribal inspectors for highway and rail:  In addition to the funding for emergency response
  activities, up to three inspectors from each state or tribe may be funded to attend training of their
  choice in either rail or highway inspection procedures.  Jurisdictions without an inspection program
  may use the funds to coordinate observation of another jurisdiction's inspection.  Rail inspections may
  be limited because of legal restrictions on inspecting rail shipments for both states and tribes.  Funding
  may be used to coordinate observation of other agencies' inspection of the shipments, including the
  Department of Transportation's Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA), the Nuclear Regulatory
  Commission's (NRC), the Department of Energy's or the state of origin's inspections of both highway
  and rail shipments and to coordinate with rail and trucking companies on safety and inspection issues.
<p>
Along with the training activities described above, the Department intends to provide funding to cover
some planning and coordination costs, as estimated below.
<p>
If an eligible jurisdiction takes the training activities described above and the method of estimating the
costs for these activities (the Department did not actually attach dollar figures to these activities in this
proposal), it could estimate how much assistance it would be eligible for each year.  However, the
Department is proposing some time restrictions on the funding.  These would be as follows:
<p>
Within the first year of eligibility to receive funding (Transportation Year [defined as the year that
shipments will commence] minus 3 or TY-3): A base grant would be available to help offset planning and
coordination costs.
<p>
Within the second year of eligibility (Transportation Year minus 2 or TY-2): A base grant would be
available to help offset estimated travel and tuition costs to send personnel to train-the trainer training,
emergency response training, and planning and coordination activities.  A variable amount of budget
would be available, for those jurisdictions that qualify, to train additional emergency response personnel. 
Proposed routes would be announced during the second year of eligibility.
<p>
Within the third year of eligibility (Transportation Year minus 1or TY-1): The base grant would be
available to offset estimated travel and tuition costs to train transportation public information staff,
inspectors, three trips for the awareness trainers to train local responders, and planning and coordination
activities.  A variable amount of money, if a jurisdiction qualifies, would be available to help offset
estimated travel and tuition costs to train additional emergency response personnel, if necessary.  The
Department would send out self-taught awareness packages to states and tribes to distribute to first-on-scene and first responder personnel. 
<p>
Within the Transportation Year (TY): Two-thirds of the budget provided in TY-1 would help offset
refresher and new personnel training.   The two-thirds multiplier is derived from a conservative estimate
that after the initial training in TY-1 and TY-2, each jurisdiction would experience a personnel turnover
rate of approximately two-thirds of their staff each year.
<p>
The information below describes the assumptions that the Department intends to use to form cost estimates
for the Department's annual allocations to recipients.
<p>
<strong>The Base Amount</strong>
<p>
<strong>Planning and Coordination Costs -- </strong>The Department intends to make these estimates by taking the
estimated salary of a health physicist employed full-time by a state government and providing a percentage
of that salary.  The salary estimate can be made either by using a Conference of Radiation Control Program
Directors' salary quote or by sampling health physicist salaries in various states and taking the average of
the sample.  One planning and coordination trip would also be estimated in this cost (see travel costs for
the cost estimate of this trip). 
<p>
<strong>Travel Costs --</strong> Planning and coordination trips would be estimated to last three days.  Travel for
hazardous materials responder, inspector, train-the-trainer, and public communications training would be
estimated to last five days.  In-state awareness training would be estimated to last five days and include
planning and coordination costs.  Air travel cost would be estimated by calculating the average airfare from
several locations around the country to the NTS and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
training centers.  Per diem costs would be estimated by using the Federal government's per diem costs for
the NTS and FEMA training locations.
<p>
<strong>Tuition Costs -- </strong>Tuition costs would be estimated by taking the estimated cost to the DOE of an NTS
Radiological Emergency Operations course and dividing it by 25 students per class.  This tuition cost
would be applied to each trainee in a hazardous materials emergency response, inspector and train-the-trainer class. 
<p>
The base amount of money would be determined from these cost estimates of the training activities
described above.
<p>
<strong>The Variable Amount</strong>
<p>
To determine the variable amount of money, each eligible jurisdiction would receive funds to train three
additional hazardous materials personnel for every 160 miles along a route.  If routes through a jurisdiction
intersect, or are less than 80 miles apart, the route miles could not be double-counted if they fall within an
80 mile radius of another route.  
<p>
The Department intends to provide a variable amount of funding based on route miles because it believes
that it is the best measure to capture any variation in impact on a jurisdiction's ability to prepare for
NWPA shipments.  The 160 mile estimate was used because other emergency response organizations have
used a two-hour response time as the limit to how frequently hazardous materials response teams should be
placed.  From the two-hour measure, one can conservatively say it would take an emergency response
vehicle an hour to travel 80 miles in either direction.

Release of Department of the Navy Draft Environmental Impact Statement for a Container
System for the Management of Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel, May 1996</H2><HR>

<BODY>
<strong> SUMMARY:</strong> In an action related to the OCRWM program, on May 14, 1996, the Department of the Navy
(Navy) published an announcement in the <a href="http://gopher.nara.gov:/70/1/register/toc">Federal Register</a> entitled <b>"Notice of Availability of the
Department of the Navy Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a Container System for
the Management of Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel; and Announcement of Public Hearings" (61 FR
24293)</b>.  In this notice, the Navy announced the release of the Draft EIS for public comment. The
Department of Energy is a cooperating agency for this draft EIS.  In an earlier <a href="http://gopher.nara.gov:/70/1/register/toc">Federal Register</a>
published on December 7, 1995, (60 FR 62828) the Navy announced its plan to assume lead
responsibility for preparation of this EIS evaluating container systems for the management of
naval spent nuclear fuel. This EIS (previously titled Environmental Impact Statement for a
Multi-Purpose Canister System for Management of Civilian and Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel) was
being prepared by OCRWM, with the Navy participating as a cooperating agency. In response to
budgetary constraints in fiscal year 1996, OCRWM halted its proposal to fabricate and deploy a
multi-purpose canister based system, and ceased preparation of the multi-purpose canister EIS,
which was to include both civilian and naval spent nuclear fuel.

<p>
Assumption of Lead Responsibility for an Environmental Impact 
Statement Evaluating Container Systems for the Management of Spent 
Nuclear Fuel
<p>
Agency: Department of the Navy</b></h3>
<hr><p>
<body>
<h4></h4><b>SUMMARY:</b>   The Department of the Navy (Navy) announces its plan to assume lead
responsibility for preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) evaluating container
systems for the management of naval spent nuclear fuel. This EIS (previously titled
Environmental Impact Statement for a Multi-Purpose Canister System for Management of
Civilian and Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel) was being prepared by the Department of Energy (DOE),
with the Navy participating as a cooperating agency, pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., in accordance with the Council on 
Environmental Quality regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1508). DOE is
halting its proposal to fabricate and deploy a multi-purpose canister based system and the Office
of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management will cease preparation of the multi-purpose canister
EIS which was to include both civilian and naval spent nuclear fuel. DOE will be a cooperating
agency in the preparation of the EIS for naval spent nuclear fuel.
<p>
<b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b>  On October 24, 1994, the DOE published in the
Federal Register (59 FR 53442) a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS for a multi-purpose canister
system for the management of civilian spent nuclear fuel. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982, as amended (42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.), DOE is responsible for disposal of civilian spent
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in a geologic repository. DOE is also responsible
for any monitored retrievable storage prior to disposal, and transportation of civilian spent
nuclear fuel in connection with disposal or storage. As part of 
carrying out these responsibilities, DOE was in the process of evaluating in an EIS the
environmental impacts of fabricating and 
deploying a standardized container system to enable storage, transportation, and possible disposal
of spent nuclear fuel.
<p>
During the scoping process for the multi-purpose canister EIS, the scope of the EIS was
broadened, based on a comment by the Navy, to include naval spent nuclear fuel. In addition to
its responsibility for civilian spent nuclear fuel, the DOE is also responsible for the management
of spent nuclear fuel derived from atomic energy defense activities, including that from the Naval
Nuclear Propulsion Program (42 U.S.C. 2121(a)(3)). Since naval spent nuclear fuel is rugged,
well characterized, and compatible with standardized container system technology, DOE
determined that naval spent fuel should be included in 
the EIS. This determination was announced in the Implementation Plan issued by DOE in August
1995 under DOE's NEPA regulations. The availability of the Implementation Plan was
announced in the Federal Register on August 30, 1995 (60 FR 45147).
<p>
DOE has advised the Navy that because of insufficient funding in Congress' recent fiscal year
1996 appropriation to the DOE Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, DOE at the
present time is halting its proposal to fabricate and deploy a multi-purpose canister based system.
As a result, DOE will cease preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement for a
Multi-Purpose Canister System for Management of Civilian and Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel.
<p>
The Navy has decided that it will proceed with that part of the multi-purpose canister EIS
covering naval spent nuclear fuel. This will be done by the Navy becoming the lead agency for
the EIS. DOE will participate as a cooperating agency since naval spent nuclear fuel is managed
at DOE facilities. Unlike civilian spent nuclear fuel which is stored in plants throughout the
country, all naval spent nuclear fuel, after removal from the reactor, is shipped to one place, the
Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), for examination and temporary storage as set
forth in the Department of Energy Programmatic Spent Nuclear Fuel Management and Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programs
Final 
Environmental Impact Statement and in the associated Record of Decision issued June 1, 1995.
Therefore, the container system EIS evaluations for the storage and transportation of naval spent
nuclear fuel at INEL will make use of information specific to that location. 
<p>
The range of alternatives being considered in the EIS will not change. Thus, the EIS does not
need to go through another scoping process as a result of only covering naval spent nuclear fuel.
The six container system alternatives being considered are:
 <ol>
<li> No-Action Alternative -- Use of existing technology to handle, store, and subsequently
transport naval spent nuclear fuel to a 
geologic repository using the M-140 transportation cask. Prior to shipment to a repository, naval
spent nuclear fuel would be stored at INEL in water pools or dry containers, then loaded into
M-140 transportation casks. At the repository, the naval spent fuel would be unloaded from the
M-140 transportation casks and placed in a geologic repository's surface facilities for loading into
disposal containers. Following unloading, the M-140 transportation casks would be returned to
INEL for reuse.
<p><li>Multi-Purpose Canister Alternative -- Use of 125-ton multi-purpose canisters currently being
designed under a DOE contract for 
storage, transportation, and disposal of naval spent nuclear fuel, without repackaging or further
handling of bare spent nuclear fuel. In addition to the sealed metal canisters, specialized casks or
overpacks would be required for different stages of the process, such as intra-site transfer, dry
storage, inter-site transportation, and disposal.
<p><li>Current Technology/Supplemented by High Capacity Rail Alternative -- Use of existing
M-140 transportation casks, but with 
redesigned internal structures to accommodate a larger amount of naval spent nuclear fuel per
cask, thus reducing the total number of shipments required.
<p><li>Transportable Storage Cask Alternative -- Use of existing, commercially available casks for
storage at INEL and shipment of naval spent nuclear fuel to a geologic repository. At the
repository, the naval spent fuel would be unloaded from the casks and placed in a geologic
repository's surface facilities for loading into disposal containers. The unloaded transportable
storage casks could be returned to INEL for further storage and transport.
<p><li>Dual-Purpose Canister Alternative -- Use of an existing, commercially available canister and
overpack system for storage at INEL and shipment of naval spent nuclear fuel to a geologic
repository. At the repository, the naval spent fuel would be unloaded from the canisters and
placed in a geologic repository's surface facilities for loading into disposal containers. 
<p><li>Small Multi-Purpose Canister Alternative -- Use of smaller, 75-ton, multi-purpose canisters
currently being designed under a DOE contract rather than the 125-ton multi-purpose canisters.
<p>
</ol>
 The Draft EIS will not contain a preferred alternative. Instead, the Navy will use public
comments on the Draft EIS to help identify a preferred alternative for the Final EIS. Consistent
with this approach, the subject EIS is being renamed as ``The Department of the Navy
Environmental Impact Statement for a Container System for the Management of Naval Spent
Nuclear Fuel.''
<p>
<b>DATES:</b>   The Navy plans to issue the Draft EIS by about April 30, 1996. Issuance of the
Draft EIS will be announced in the Federal Register. A 45 day comment period will be provided
following issuance of the Draft EIS. Public hearings will be held during the 45 day comment
period. The locations and dates of these public hearings will be announced in the Federal
Register when the Draft EIS is issued. The Navy plans to issue the final EIS by November 30,
1996, and plans to issue a Record of Decision by December 31, 1996.

  <p>         
<b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b>
  <p>         
<b>Background</b>
 <p>          
On October 24, 1994, the Department of Energy issued a Notice of Intent in the Federal Register
(55 FR 53442) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the fabrication and deployment
of a multi-purpose canister-based system for the management of civilian spent nuclear fuel (MPC
Environmental Impact Statement).  In the Notice of Intent, the Department identified the
proposed action as the fabrication and deployment of certain components of a multi-purpose
canister-based system.  Specifically, the proposed action includes two sizes of MPCs (a 125-ton
and a 75-ton MPC), with associated rail transportation cask and on-site transfer casks.  The
proposed action would provide a standardized container system to handle, store, transport and
dispose of spent nuclear fuel in order to minimize or eliminate the need for the spent nuclear fuel
to be removed from canisters or casks during storage and transportation, and, to the extent
practicable, be compatible with disposal.  DOE requested comments on the scope of the
Environmental Impact Statement.  
 <p>          
The Notice of Intent established a public scoping period which began October 24, 1994, and
ended January 6, 1995. However, the Department found it practicable to consider all comments
received by March 31, 1995.  The Department held public scoping meetings in Las Vegas,
Nevada on November 21, 1994; Chicago, Illinois on November 30, 1994; and Washington, D.C.
on December 7, 1994, to provide an opportunity for public participation by interested
individuals, organizations, and other governmental agencies.  During the public scoping period,
about 400 commenters provided a total of 2,832 comments, either by participating in the
meetings
or by submitting comments via response forms, letters, postcards, toll-free telephone messages,
facsimiles, electronic mail, or electronic bulletin board to the Department.  In response
to comments received during scoping from the Department of the Navy, the scope of the MPC
Environmental Impact Statement has been expanded to include consideration of the use of
MPCs,
and alternatives to the MPC-based system, for naval spent nuclear fuel.  The Department of the
Navy will be a cooperating agency in preparing this EIS, in accordance with 40 CFR  1501.6
and
10 CFR  1021.342.
<p>      
<b>MPC Environmental Impact Statement Alternatives</b>
<p>     
The alternatives to be evaluated in the MPC Environmental Impact Statement address future dry
storage, transportation, and disposal needs, and include the fabrication and deployment of a range
of single- and dual-purpose cask and canister hardware systems, and a multi-purpose canister
hardware system.  The alternative hardware systems differ in whether they are based on
single-unit, heavily-shielded "casks" that feature bolted lids, or on relatively thin-walled
"canisters" that are sealed by welding and used with separate, specialized overpacks for purposes
of storage, transportation, or disposal.  
 <p>          
The five alternatives to the proposed action that will be evaluated in this EIS are:  (1) a
"no-action" alternative, which is the current technology comprising different systems of
specialized single- and dual-purpose canisters  and casks that have been certified by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission or are currently undergoing certification; (2) the current technology
supplemented by high-capacity rail transportation casks; (3) a system of transportable storage
casks; (4) a system of dual-purpose canisters; and (5) a system utilizing only the small (75-ton)
MPCs.  Alternatives (4) and (5) were added in response to comments received during the public
scoping period.
<p>        
<b>Areas to be Addressed</b>
<p>     
The MPC Environmental Impact Statement will address potential environmental impacts of the
proposed action and alternatives in three general areas:  1) manufacturing, 2) handling and
storage
activities at facilities, and 3) transportation.  The analysis of the potential environmental impacts
of these three areas of activity will emphasize those impacts which discriminate among the
alternatives.
 <p>     
<b>Manufacturing:</b>
 <p>     
Because the actual sites where manufacturing would take place have not been chosen, the
analysis
of potential manufacturing impacts will be based on the environmental settings of typical or
representative manufacturing facilities (those facilities that currently produce hardware identical
or similar to the proposed or alternative hardware systems), as well as a qualitative site-specific
analysis at two known potential manufacturing locations.
<p>             
<b>Handling and Storage:</b>
 <p>     
The evaluation of at-reactor handling and storage activities will be based on representative site
data derived from data collected at existing spent fuel storage locations.  Site-specific National
Environmental Policy Act documents for commercial reactor sites already have been issued by
the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Handling and storage activities for naval spent nuclear
fuel
at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory will be addressed in the Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel
Appendix to the MPC Environmental Impact Statement.  The analysis in the MPC
Environmental
Impact Statement of potential impacts at a repository will consider the use of the MPC and
alternative hardware systems only for surface activities, since ultimate disposition impacts can be
meaningfully assessed only in connection with proposed repository acceptance criteria.  Such
criteria will be analyzed in a separate Environmental Impact Statement that the Department will
prepare for the candidate repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.    
<p>              
<b>Transportation:</b>
 <p>         
The impacts of transportation activities for each alternative will be assessed using existing
transportation impact models for shipments. Transportation evaluations would consider
shipments
between each existing storage location and two hypothetical Monitored Retrievable Storage
facility locations, and subsequently to the candidate repository facility at Yucca Mountain, or
between each existing storage location directly to the candidate repository facility. 
Representative
routes will be chosen between origination and destination sites for purposes of assessing the
potential risks involved in such transportation, including use of a potential rail spur at Yucca
Mountain.
<p>     
<b>Availability of Implementation Plan</b>
<p>
Copies of the Implementation Plan are being provided to Federal agencies, Indian tribal
organizations, State and local government agencies, public interest groups, manufacturers of
equipment, transportation interests, industry and utility organizations, regulators, and
members of the general public who indicated an interest in receiving a copy or who participated
in
the public scoping processes. The Implementation Plan will be provided upon request to
additional parties who express interest by calling 1-800-672-3304.  Copies of the Implementation
Plan also have been placed in the Department of Energy reading rooms identified below.  Please

<html><hr><head><h2>The Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System</h2></head>
<hr><p>
<body>
The U.S. Congress has assigned responsibility for the nation's nuclear waste disposal system to
the Department of Energy. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (1982) and its amendments directed 
the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management within the Department of 
Energy to develop, construct, and operate a system for spent nuclear fuel and high-level
radioactive waste disposal, including a permanent geologic repository, interim storage capability
and transportation system.
<p>
Since the late 1950s, the American people have relied more and more on nuclear energy. Nuclear
power plants now supply about one-fifth of the electricity we use to light and heat our homes,
schools, factories, offices, and farms. The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management is
responsible for the planning, research, and management necessary to dispose of spent nuclear fuel produced by commercial nuclear power plants and Government owned high-level radioactive waste. 
<p>
<strong>A Temporary Solution</strong>
<p>
Currently, as the nuclear fuel that generates electricity in reactors is used, or "spent," and is no
longer efficient to fuel a reactor, it is removed and stored in specially designed pools of water, or
in some instances, placed into heavy, thick-walled metal or concrete structures for above-ground
dry storage at reactor sites. Such storage has been proven safe, but is only intended to be a
temporary solution. 
<p>
A temporary storage facility would provide earlier waste acceptance capability for spent nuclear
fuel. This facility may be in the form of an interim storage facility, a specially designed,
above-ground structure that would receive spent nuclear fuel from utilities and store it until a
repository opens. A related interim storage approach involves the use of a multi-purpose canister
(MPC). An MPC would be loaded with spent nuclear fuel assemblies, and then sealed at each
reactor site. Rather than handle individual spent nuclear fuel assemblies directly at other transfer
points in the disposal system, the MPC could then be placed inside other containers specially
designed for either transportation, interim storage or permanent disposal. An MPC-based system
offers a uniform approach to handle and dispose of spent nuclear fuel.  (In response to budgetary
constraints for the civilian radioactive waste management program in fiscal year 1996, OCRWM
will not pursue development of an MPC system beyond the initial design stage.)
<p>
<strong>Transportation</strong>
<p>
Another important element of the waste management system is transportation. In order to safely
and efficiently move radioactive waste around the country, the Department of Energy has been
developing special containers, or "casks," for highway and rail transport, and is working with
state, local, and tribal officials to ensure appropriate emergency response capabilities. The
rugged, thick-walled casks are designed with protection of the public and the environment in
mind, even in hypothetical accident situations.  These designs must pass a series of rigorous
safety tests in order to be certified for use by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Federal
agency with responsibility for licensing nuclear facilities and approving transportation methods.
<p>
<strong>Repository</strong>
<p>
The final element of the waste management system is known as a permanent geologic repository.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, directed the Department of Energy to concentrate its site characterization studies at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, to determine its suitability as a safe disposal site for spent nuclear fuel.
Teams of scientists are studying the mountain from the surface as well as from underground
tunnels to test such characteristics as the likelihood of volcanic or earthquake activity, or
potential movement of water through the mountain. The depth of the proposed repository would
be about 300 meters (1,000 feet) below the surface of the mountain but still about 240 meters
(800 feet) above the water table within a very hard layer of rock called volcanic tuff. If the site is
found suitable, and compliance with regulatory requirements can be met, operation is scheduled
to start in 2010. If it is found unsuitable, studies will be stopped, the site will be restored, and
DOE will report to Congress within six months on a recommended course of action.
<p>
<strong>The Nuclear Waste Fund</strong>
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established a specific funding mechanism for developing the
waste disposal system, the Nuclear Waste Fund. Funds are collected from those who use
electricity produced by nuclear reactors rather than the general taxpayer. <a href="fundfct.htm">(See the fact sheet on Program Funding.)</a>

<html><hr><head><h2>National Environmental Policy Act</h2></head>
<hr><p>
<body>The National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 requires Federal
agencies, including the Department of Energy, to evaluate potential environmental
impacts when planning a major Federal action. In this way, public officials gain necessary
information to use in making informed decisions.
<p>
Another major emphasis of the Act is to promote public awareness at the earliest planning stages
and to provide opportunities for the public to provide input. The process is meant to be a
dialogue between the Federal government and the public.
<p>
<strong>NEPA, Start To Finish</strong>
<p>
The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, established the Council on Environmental
Quality which acts as a "watchdog" for the NEPA process. This organization is part of the
executive branch and has developed regulations that Federal agencies must follow when
developing an Environmental Impact Statement or EIS. Each Government agency, including
DOE, has developed specific regulations to comply with the Council's procedures.
<p>
Major Federal actions come in many varieties, for example, a rerouted interstate highway, a new
dam, or a ski resort expansion on Federally-owned land. If an action has been studied in the past
and does not have significant impact, or if it can be compared to an activity the law defines as not
having significant impact, it may be excluded and no further NEPA studies are necessary. The
agency can then implement its proposed action.
<p>
If the proposed action is not excluded from further study, the NEPA process continues. The next
step is to determine whether an action will have significant impacts on the environment. If the
answer is yes, NEPA outlines a detailed process for an EIS. If the answer is unknown, a less
detailed study, called an Environmental Assessment (EA), is prepared first, as an aid to decide on
further action.  An EA is a document that analyzes whether the action would significantly impact
the environment. The findings of an EA determine whether to prepare a more detailed
Environmental Impact Statement or issue a Finding of No Significant Impact.
<p>
Preparing the Environmental Impact Statement is a well-defined process in itself. First, a Notice
of Intent must be issued in the Federal Register to inform the public that a study will be done.
Then, in a process known as "scoping," the general public as well as Federal, State, and local
agencies and Indian tribes, are asked to give their comments and to better define the issues that
should be covered. Next, a draft Environmental Impact Statement is written. NEPA requires a
minimum 45-day period for public comment when the draft EIS is issued. Afterwards, the Federal
agency issues a final Environmental Impact Statement which responds to oral and written
comments received during the public review of the draft. The agency is now prepared to
make an informed decision and, after a 30-day waiting period, issues a Record of Decision. The
Federal agency may then begin implementation of its decision.
<p>
<strong>Focus Of An Environmental Impact Statement</strong>
<p>
After scoping and during the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement, experts examine
the potential impacts of the proposed action, as well as impacts from several reasonable
alternatives. The EIS identifies both positive and negative  effects and must consider all
interrelated elements of the environment -- not only the natural component (air, water, geology,
ecology) but the human component (jobs, housing, schools, health and safety, transportation,
cultural resources, noise, aesthetics). The study must also identify opportunities for reducing or
eliminating significant adverse impacts.
<p>
An EIS must also examine the impacts of not implementing the proposed action. This is called
the "no-action" alternative and may mean that the agency simply continues using existing
approaches.
<p>
The NEPA process does not dictate that an agency choose the most environmentally acceptable
or least expensive alternative. The purpose of the NEPA process is to ensure that necessary and
accurate studies are done, that they are done with public involvement, and that public officials,
like those at the Department of Energy, make decisions based on an understanding of
environmental and social consequences.
<p>
<strong>Public Involvement in the NEPA Process</strong>
<p>
Public input in the NEPA process is emphasized early on in the scoping phase and during public
comment periods; it strengthens the NEPA process. Concerns raised during public scoping help
shape the issues in the Environmental Impact Statement. Comments received from the public are
responded to and included in the final document. The Federal Register publishes Notices of
Intent for specific EISs, and in addition to area newspapers, will announce Public Scoping
Meetings or Public Hearings.

<html><hr><head><h2>Nuclear Waste Policy Act and Amendments</h2></head>
<hr><p>
<body>In 1982, Congress enacted the first comprehensive legislation regarding spent nuclear fuel and
high-level radioactive waste disposal. This Federal law is called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.
Congress based this law on recommendations from groups such as the National Academy of
Sciences, the U.S. Geological Survey, and several professional scientific organizations. 
<p>
Spent nuclear fuel is the radioactive by-product of generating electricity at commercial nuclear
power plants. Most high-level radioactive waste is the by-product of production at defense
facilities. It is these categories of waste for which the Nuclear Waste Policy Act directs the
Department of Energy to develop a waste disposal system.
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) within the Department of Energy to develop, construct, and operate a system for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste disposal, including a permanent geologic repository, interim storage capability and a transportation system. 
<p>
Scientists have studied many options, including leaving the waste at the reactor sites, burying it
in the ocean floor, putting it in polar ice sheets, and rocketing it into outer space. Based on a final
Environmental Impact Statement prepared in 1980 that evaluated all of these options, deep
underground geologic disposal was determined to be the safest solution. 
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established a specific funding mechanism for developing the
waste disposal system, the Nuclear Waste Fund. Funds are collected from those who use
electricity produced by nuclear reactors rather than the general taxpayer. <a href="fundfct.htm">(See the fact sheet on Program Funding.)</a>
<p>
<strong>Site Selection Process</strong>
<p>
In the search for a site for the permanent repository, OCRWM had initially conducted a national
search for a potential site; eventually nine sites were chosen to be studied in six different states.
Then President Ronald Reagan approved three sites from a candidate list of five for more
detailed study, a process called site characterization. These locations were: Hanford, Washington;
Deaf Smith County, Texas; and Yucca Mountain, Nevada.
<p>
<strong>1987 Amendments</strong>
<p>
In December 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed the
Department of Energy to study only one site, Yucca Mountain, Nevada, to determine whether it
was a suitable site for a repository. The Amendments Act directs that if, at any time Yucca
Mountain was found unsuitable, studies are to be stopped immediately, the site restored, and the
Department is to report to Congress within six months on a recommended course of action.
<p>
The Amendments Act also authorized the Secretary of Energy to site a Monitored Retrievable
Storage facility. This facility differs from the repository in that it is an above-ground facility that
would store a limited amount of spent nuclear fuel temporarily prior to sending it to a permanent
repository. It would also provide flexibility in the system while a repository is being built.
<p>
To facilitate siting an interim storage facility, Congress established the Office of the Nuclear
Waste Negotiator within the executive branch and independent from the Department of Energy.
The Negotiator was responsible for developing an agreement to host such a facility between any
willing volunteer and the Federal government. The agreement could include reasonable
incentives and financial arrangements, as well as various types of public programs, projects, and
problem-solving assistance. After an unsuccessful search for a volunteer host, the Office of the Negotiator
was terminated when Congress did not reauthorize funding for the office in 1995.
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, also includes some additional requirements. It
requires spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to be transported in containers certified by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the same organization that must license permanent and interim
storage facilities. The amendments also require that the Department of Energy abide by
the regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding advance notification to States,
local governments and tribal officials prior to transportation. Also, the Department of Energy will
provide technical assistance and funding for safety and emergency response training of State,
local and tribal officials in affected areas. This funding is available in the planning stages in
preparation for future transportation of spent nuclear fuel.
<p>
<strong>Independent Evaluation</strong>
<p>
The Amendments Act created the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board,
an independent establishment within the executive branch of the government.  The responsibility
of the Board is to evaluate the technical and scientific validity of OCRWM's activities. Members
are nominated by the National Academy of Sciences and appointed by the President to serve
terms of four years. The Board reports to Congress at least twice each year and presents
conclusions from investigations on the current program activities as well as recommendations.

<html><title>Program Funding</title>
<head><h2>Program Funding</h2></head>
<p><hr>
<body><strong>Sources of Program Funding </strong>
<p>
The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management receives program funding from three
sources: the Nuclear Waste Fund, the Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal appropriation, and the
Civilian Radioactive Waste Research and Development Account. 
<p>
<strong>Ratepayer Dollars for  Civilian Waste    </strong>
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Fund was created by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982. The
Fund, composed of payments made  by the generators and owners of spent nuclear fuel and high-level
radioactive waste, was established to ensure that the costs of carrying out activities relating to 
the disposal of these materials will be  borne by the persons responsible for generating them [Sec.
111(b)(4), NWPA].  
<p>
The Fund is held in the Treasury of the United States, but is managed and administered by the Department of Energy. The NWPA requires that the budget of the Nuclear Waste Fund be submitted to Congress triennially, along with the Departmental budget submitted at that time. In actual practice, however, the Department  has submitted an annual budget for the 
Nuclear Waste Fund, and Congress has  made annual appropriations from the Fund for expenditures to support activities mandated by the NWPA. Amounts in this Fund not appropriated for expenditure are invested by the Department in U.S.  Treasury securities.  
<p>
<strong>Fees </strong>
<p>
The NWPA provides for two types of fees: an ongoing fee of 1 mill (one tenth of a cent) per
kilowatt-hour of electricity generated and sold on or after April 7, 1983 <cite>1</cite>, and a one-time fee for
electricity generated prior to April 7, 1983. Utilities have three payment options for the one-time
fee: (1) pay in 40 quarterly installments with accrued  interest, (2) pay in a lump sum with 
accrued interest prior to the first scheduled delivery of spent fuel to the Department of Energy for
disposal, or (3) pay in  a lump sum prior to June 30, 1985, with  no interest. These fees are incorporated
into the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste,
promulgated as a Federal rule in 1983, which establishes the responsibilities and rights of the
Department and the owners and generators of  the spent nuclear fuel and high-level  radioactive
waste. The NWPA provides for an annual assessment of the adequacy of the 1-mill/kWh disposal
fee. In the event that the fee is determined to be inadequate or excessive, the Secretary of Energy
is to propose a  fee adjustment to Congress. Annual appropriations to the program from the Nuclear
Waste Fund are currently considered to be discretionary appropriations subject to the
discretionary spending caps established by law. This has resulted in substantial underfunding for the program. 
<p>
<img src="income.jpg" align="middle">
<p>
<strong>Assets  </strong>
<p>
Nuclear Waste Fund<cite> 2</cite> assets as of September 30, 1995, included investments with a net book
value of $5.1 billion, receivables related to ongoing quarterly fees of $149.4 million, receivables from
one-time fees of $881 million, cumulative accrued interest on one-time fees of $1,084 million, 
and receivables for interest from investments of $105 million.  In addition, the accrued Department of
Energy liability for defense waste disposal costs paid from the Fund, including interest, totals $1.1 billion. 
<p>
<strong>Expenditures </strong>
<p>
Cumulative expenses paid from the Nuclear Waste Fund, including direct appropriations to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, the former
Monitored Retrievable Storage Commission, and the former Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator, from
inception of the program through the period ending September 30, 1995, were $4.5 billion. 
<p>
<strong>Taxpayer Dollars for  Defense Wastes </strong>
<p>
On April 30, 1985, the President determined that defense high-level waste should be disposed of
in the civilian  repository. On August 20, 1987, the  Department of Energy published in the <em>Federal
Register</em> the method to be used  in calculating the share of total waste  management system costs
allocable to  the disposal of defense high-level radioactive waste. The defense share of total
system life-cycle cost was estimated to  be $6.4 billion in 1994 dollars in the last  published (September
1995) total system life-cycle cost estimate. Costs incurred for defense waste disposal activities
through September 30, 1995, were $1.5 billion, including principal and interest. The  Department
of Energy made two payments into the Nuclear Waste Fund: $5 million in fiscal year 1991, and
$7.5 million in fiscal year 1992. Beginning in fiscal year 1993, the Congress established  a separate
Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal appropriation, in lieu of direct  payment by the Department into
the Nuclear Waste Fund. $100 million was  appropriated for fiscal year 1993, $120 million for
fiscal year 1994, $129.4 million for fiscal year 1995 and $248.4 million for fiscal year 1996. These
funds are not deposited into the Nuclear Waste Fund, but are available for use by the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management to carry out activities pursuant to the NWPA. <p><b>Civilian
Radioactive Waste Research and Development Account</b><p>The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management also administers the Civilian Radioactive Waste Research and  Development account. Like the
Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal appropriation, this account consists of appropriations from
general taxpayer revenues. It is  used to carry out generic research, development, and demonstration
activities authorized by Title II of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  The fiscal year 1996 Energy Supply
Research and Development Appropriation provides no funding for this account.
 <p>
<strong><h4>Program Revenues</h4></strong>
<p>
As of September 30, 1995, the Nuclear Waste Fund's accrued revenue from ongoing fees was approximately $6.0 billion. Accrued revenue from one-time fees, including interest, was approximately $3.4 billion. In addition, the Nuclear Waste Fund had earned approximately $2.4 billion from investments in Treasury securities. Total accrued revenue from defense atomic
energy activities, including principal and interest,  is approximately $1.5 billion. Total accrued revenue from
all sources, including Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal appropriations, is approximately $13.3
billion.
<hr>
<cite>1</cite> On December 6, 1985, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the
ongoing 1-mill-per-kilowatt-hour fee should be based on net generation rather than gross
generation of electricity. As a result, the Department of Energy refunded approximately $48
million in principal and interest payments to the utilities.
<p>
On March 17, 1989, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the
interpretation of "net electricity generated... and sold" should include only electricity that is both
generated and actually sold. Accordingly, the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear
Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste was amended on December 31, 1991, to reflect the
decision of the Court. Credits were provided against future utility payments as appropriate to
compensate for previous overpayments.
<p>
<cite>2</cite> Financial data on the Nuclear Waste Fund and the Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal
Appropriation are from the program's audited financial statements for fiscal year 1995.

<H1><B>Safety:  The Key to Success</B></H1><HR>

Disposing of the spent nuclear fuel from the nation's commercial nuclear reactors is a highly technical activity as well as a challenging environmental issue.  While nuclear power provides a valuable, alternative source of energy and allows utility companies to keep up with ever increasing energy demands, its by-product, used or "spent" nuclear fuel, must be disposed of safely.<P>

The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management within the Department of Energy has the responsibility for planning, constructing, and managing a national system to dispose of spent nuclear fuel.  The system has four elements: waste acceptance, storage, transportation, and disposal.  A principal component stressed at every level of the program is the importance of containing radioactive material until the radioactivity decreases.<P>

<H4><B>Temporary Storage</B></H4>

Utility companies have been storing spent nuclear fuel safely since the 1950s when nuclear energy was first used.  After spent nuclear fuel is removed from a reactor, it is stored at reactor sites most often in specially treated water pools lined with concrete and steel.  Water not only cools the spent nuclear fuel but acts as a natural barrier to shield workers from radiation.  Although this storage method has been proven safe, it is not intended to be a permanent storage solution.<P>

In some cases, utilities have decided to use dry storage systems.  Fuel assemblies are loaded into heavy stainless steel or concrete casks and are stored either upright on a concrete pad or horizontally in concrete bunkers.  Like pool storage, dry storage has been proven safe but is not intended to be a permanent solution for waste disposal.<H4></H4>

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="../../../pictures/facts/safety.gif"><P>

<H4><B>Permanent Disposal</B></H4>

Many possibilities for permanent disposal have been studied in depth.  Options included leaving the waste at the reactor site, burying it in the ocean floor, putting it in polar ice sheets, and rocketing it into outer space.  Based on a final Environmental Impact Statement prepared in 1980,  and recommendations from groups such as the National Academy of Sciences, the U.S. Geological Survey, and several professional scientific organizations, deep underground disposal was chosen as the best option.  <P>

In 1982, Congress enacted legislation regarding high-level radioactive waste disposal, called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  The Act established within the Department of Energy the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste     Management to develop, construct, and operate a system for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste disposal.  The system will include elements for waste acceptance, storage, transportation, and a permanent geologic repository.<P>

<H4><B>Mined Geologic Disposal System</B></H4>

The repository, or a mined geologic disposal system, will be a system of tunnels built deep beneath the surface, and surface facilities.  Many natural barriers will enhance the safety of an underground facility.  The characteristics of the rock layers in which spent nuclear fuel could be placed are studied very carefully by teams of geologists.  Other teams of scientists study important factors such as the likelihood of volcanic or earthquake activity or the way water moves within the rock.<P>

In an amendment to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in 1987, Congress directed the Department of Energy to concentrate site characterization studies on one site, Yucca Mountain, Nevada, located about 161 kilometers (100 miles) northwest of Las Vegas.  Detailed geologic and  hydrologic site characterization studies will continue for many more years.  A system of tunnels and underground laboratories is planned to allow scientists access to the level of the proposed repository about 300 meters (1,000 feet) below the surface.  This level is still about 240 meters (800 feet) above the region's water table.<P>

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, stressed that if at any time Yucca Mountain is found unsuitable, studies will be stopped immediately, the site will be restored, and DOE will report to Congress within six months on a recommended course of action.<P>

In addition to the many natural barriers a repository site will provide, several man-made barriers will enhance protection of the environment from radiation.  Within the repository, fuel assemblies are inside sealed canisters surrounded with additional layers of steel, concrete, or other metals.  Highly trained engineers and scientists will monitor the repository's condition and radiation levels from a network of surface facilities. <P>

<H4><B>Transporting Spent Nuclear Fuel: Decades Of Success</B></H4>

Spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive materials are moved around the country almost every day.  Shipments go to and from research institutions, nuclear power plants, government research facilities and storage facilities.  The safety record for spent nuclear fuel transport is excellent.  In over three decades, there has not been a single death or injury due to the release of the radioactive contents of the specially designed casks during transportation. <P>

The specialized casks used to ship nuclear waste are the primary transportation safety feature.  Each is carefully designed and built to withstand rigorous conditions before it is certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  A cask design must be able to withstand a 9 meter (30-foot) drop onto an unyielding surface, a drop onto a 15 centimeter (6-inch) pin, immersion in water for eight hours, and being engulfed in flame for 30 minutes. NRC certification is to ensure that cask designs will withstand credible transportation accidents.<P>

To compliment the technical safety characteristics built into casks, the Department of Energy was directed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, to provide funds for training for affected State, local, and Tribal officials.  Training will cover both safe, routine transportation practices and emergency response procedures.<P>

<H1><B>Spent Nuclear Fuel</B></H1><HR>

In December of 1957, history was made when Pennsylvania's Shippingport nuclear reactor became the first commercial power plant to generate electricity by harnessing the energy released by nuclear fission.  More than 100 commercial nuclear power plants have since been built in the United States and  about 20 percent of the nation's electricity comes from nuclear power.  In some regions of the country over 50 percent of the electricity is produced from nuclear power.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="../../../pictures/facts/spent1.gif"><P>

Nuclear power allows utility companies to keep up with the ever increasing demands for electricity.  Like other industrial plants, nuclear power stations produce waste.  The primary waste by-product from a nuclear reactor is used or "spent" nuclear fuel assemblies.<P>

<H4><B>What Does Spent Nuclear Fuel Look Like?</B></H4>

Nuclear fuel consists of small, ceramic-like pellets of enriched uranium, slightly larger than pencil erasers.  These small pellets produce a tremendous amount of energy when used in a nuclear power plant.  For example, one pellet contains the energy equivalent to almost one ton of coal.  The pellets are stacked end-to-end and sealed in strong metal tubes 3.5-4.5 meters (12-15 feet) long.  Each small pellet is capable of producing tremendous amounts of  energy.  For example, one pellet contains the energy equivalent to almost one ton of coal.  The tubes containing the uranium pellets are bundled together in groups of about 200 to form nuclear fuel assemblies.  These fuel assemblies are placed inside a nuclear reactor where the nuclear fission process takes place.  Fission is a controlled chain reaction, where atoms split, releasing energy and heat.  The heat is used to generate steam and produce electricity until the fuel is spent, or no longer efficient in generating heat.<P>

Approximately every 18 months, about a third of a reactor's fuel is removed and replaced with new, more efficient fuel.  Radioactive materials remain inside the sealed tubes of spent nuclear fuel assemblies.  Because the fuel assemblies emit radiation, they must be isolated from the environment for thousands of years while the radiation decreases to acceptable levels already found in nature.  This process happens naturally over time.<P>

<H4><B>Temporary Storage</B></H4>

After spent nuclear fuel assemblies are removed from a reactor, they are stored at the reactor site in specially treated water pools lined with concrete and steel.  Water not only cools the spent nuclear fuel but acts as a natural barrier to shield workers from radiation.  Although nuclear power plants in the United States store their spent nuclear fuel this way, it is not intended to be a permanent storage solution.<P>

When additional storage space is needed, utilities have elected to use dry storage systems. This method of storage involves heavy concrete or steel containers, called dry casks, placed on a concrete pad or in a concrete bunker above-ground at the reactor site.  Like pool storage, dry storage has been proven safe but is not intended to be a permanent solution for waste disposal.<P>

As a part of the Department of Energy, the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management has been given the responsibility by Congress to plan, construct, and manage a national system for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  Congress also provided special funding for the program through the Nuclear Waste Fund.  Utilities and rate-payers who benefit from nuclear energy, rather than the general taxpayer, contribute to the fund through their utility bills.<P>

<H4><B>A Permanent Solution</B></H4>

Spent nuclear fuel and high-level  radioactive waste will eventually be disposed of in an underground repository.  The repository  will be built deep beneath the earth's surface and will be designed to contain high-level radioactive material for up to 10,000 years.  Certain "engineered barriers" will be incorporated into the design to complement natural barriers and further isolate radiation.  Congress has directed the Department of Energy to examine Yucca Mountain,        Nevada, and study the area's suitability for a repository.  These studies are known as site characterization.<P>

<H4><B>Volume Of Spent Nuclear Fuel</B></H4>

Through 1993, civilian nuclear reactors had produced more than 28,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, about enough to cover one football field three yards deep. The nation's inventory of spent nuclear fuel will reach 40,000 metric tons by the year 2000.  This is not a large amount in comparison with the millions of tons of hazardous waste produced each year in the United States.  But because spent nuclear fuel is highly radioactive, it requires special measures of protection.<P>

<TITLE>Radiation</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="../../../pictures/facts/sun.gif"><B>Radiation</B></H1><HR>

Radiation is a natural part of our every day lives.  Cosmic rays filtering through the atmosphere are an example of natural radiation, as is radon gas.  In fact, radiation in some forms is necessary to life on earth.<P>

More than four-fifths of the radiation we receive comes from natural sources like sunlight, soil and certain types of rocks.  This is called background radiation because it is present everywhere all the time.<P>

In addition, people are exposed to radiation from manufactured sources.  There is no difference between background radiation and manufactured radiation.  Common household items like color televisions and smoke detectors are sources of what is called man-made radiation as are x-rays.  These man-made sources account for less than one-fifth of our radiation exposure.  <P>

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="../../../pictures/facts/rbasic.gif"><P>

<H4><B>Radiation Basics</B></H4>

The study of radiation begins with the atom.  Tremendous amounts of energy are stored in an atom's center, or nucleus.  Scientists have studied how to split an atom in order to capture the energy stored there.  When atoms are split, two things are produced:  one is heat, the other is radiation.  The heat produced in this type of reaction can be used to turn water into steam and produce electricity.  This is the basis for nuclear power production.<P>

The radiation produced from splitting an atom's nucleus is emitted in three forms: alpha and beta particles, and gamma rays.  Alpha particles are the slowest moving of the three types of radiation.  They can travel only a few inches in the air, and can easily be shielded by a sheet of paper or the outer layer of a person's skin.  Alpha particles are only harmful if swallowed or inhaled.<P>

Beta particles are more energetic than alpha particles.  They can travel in the air for a few feet.  Although they can pass through a sheet of paper, they can be stopped with a sheet of aluminum foil, or glass.  Like alpha particles, they may cause the most serious effects if swallowed or inhaled.<P>

Gamma rays, unlike alpha or beta particles, are pure energy and are essentially high-energy x-rays.  This type of radiation can be very penetrating and requires shielding from such materials as concrete, lead, steel or water to stop them.  Water, as a natural barrier to radiation, is used often to isolate radioactive spent nuclear fuel assemblies at nuclear power stations.<P>

A person's exposure to radiation is measured in units called millirems.  Millirems measure the effects of radiation on the human body just as degrees measure temperature.  An average American's exposure to radiation is about 360 millirems per year.  Roughly 300 millirems come from natural sources of radiation; 60 millirems come from man-made sources, primarily medical procedures.  Less than one millirem per year comes from the use of nuclear power.<P>

<H4><B>Other Factors</B></H4>

Geography can play a part in how much radiation a person receives.  Background radiation varies from state to state. A person living in Louisiana would receive 92 millirems per year.  The same person in Colorado would receive 179 millirems per year.  Colorado's dose is higher due to that state's higher altitude and soil content. The atmosphere is thinner at higher altitudes and allows more radiation exposure from space to penetrate.  In Kerala, India, with the highest known level of background radiation for an inhabited area, a person receives 1,300 millirems per year, more than three and one-half times as much as a person living in the U.S.<P>

It is not uncommon for people to receive far more than the average of 360 millirem per year  due to a variety of other factors.  Airplane travel, dental and medical x-rays, and occupation may affect average radiation levels.<P>

<H4><B>Setting Limits</B></H4>

Standards for public protection from the effects of radiation have been in existence for more than 40 years.  Exposure standards are set by the U.S. National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement, the International Commission on Radiation Protection, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. <P>
 
Federal law requires that nuclear facilities be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Maximum exposure for the general public from the operation of a nuclear facility is set at 25 millirems per year.  Exposures far below this limit are achieved by employing conservative design features and adhering to strict operating procedures for all fuel handling operations.  <P>

<H4><B>Some Examples</B></H4>
<UL>
<DD>A person flying in an airplane across the country would add about 5 millirems per flight because of the increased elevation during the trip.  Airline pilots and flight attendants are exposed to higher levels of radiation routinely due to their occupations.<P>

<DD>A person receiving a full set of dental x-rays would add about 40 millirems per year.<P>

<DD>A person living directly outside a nuclear power facility would add approximately 1 millirem per year.<P>

<DD>A person working in a nuclear power plant would add approximately 300 millirems per year.<P>

<DD>A person sitting on a park bench as a truck carrying nuclear waste passes by would add less than one-tenth of a millirem.<P>

HIGH-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE AND SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL</H3>

<H4><A NAME="SEC111">FINDINGS </A>AND PURPOSES</H4>

<P>
Sec. 111. (a) Findings. The Congress finds that
<P>
(1) radioactive waste creates potential risks and requires safe
and environmentally acceptable methods of disposal;
<P>
(2) a national problem has been created by the accumulation of
(A) spent nuclear fuel from nuclear reactors; and (B) radioactive
waste from (i) reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel; (ii) activities
related to medical research, diagnosis, and treatment; and (iii)
other sources;
<P>
(3) Federal efforts during the past 30 years to devise a permanent
solution to the problems of civilian radioactive waste disposal
have not been adequate;
<P>
(4) while the Federal Government has the responsibility to provide
for the permanent disposal of high- level radioactive waste and
such spent nuclear fuel as may be disposed of in order to protect
the public health and safety and the environment, the costs of
such disposal should be the responsibility of the generators and
owners of such waste and spent fuel;
<P>
(5) the generators and owners of high-level radioactive waste
and spent nuclear fuel have the primary responsibility to provide
for, and the responsibility to pay the costs of, the interim storage
of such waste and spent fuel until such waste and spent fuel is
accepted by the Secretary of Energy in accordance with the provisions
of this Act [42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.];
<P>
(6) State and public participation in the planning and development
of repositories is essential in order to promote public confidence
in the safety of disposal of such waste and spent fuel; and
<P>
(7) high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel have become
major subjects of public concern, and appropriate precautions
must be taken to ensure that such waste and spent fuel do not
adversely affect the public health and safety and the environment
for this or future generations.
<P>
(b) Purposes. The purposes of this subtitle [42 U.S.C. 10131 et
seq.] are
<P>
(1) to establish a schedule for the siting, construction, and
operation of repositories that will provide a reasonable assurance
that the public and the environment will be adequately protected
from the hazards posed by high-level radioactive waste and such
spent nuclear fuel as may be disposed of in a repository;
<P>
(2) to establish the Federal responsibility, and a definite Federal
policy, for the disposal of such waste and spent fuel;
<P>
(3) to define the relationship between the Federal Government
and the State governments with respect to the disposal of such
waste and spent fuel; and
<P>
(4) to establish a Nuclear Waste Fund, composed of payments made
by the generators and owners of such waste and spent fuel, that
will ensure that the costs of carrying out activities relating
to the disposal of such waste and spent fuel will be borne by
the persons responsible for generating such waste and spent fuel.

<H4><A NAME="SEC112">RECOMMENDATION</A> OF CANDIDATE SITES FOR
SITE CHARACTERIZATION</H4>

<P>
Sec. 112. (a) Guidelines. Not later than 180 days after the date
of the enactment of this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], the Secretary,
following consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality,
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the
Director of the Geological Survey, and interested Governors, and
the concurrence of the Commission shall issue general guidelines
for the recommendation of sites for repositories. Such guidelines
shall specify detailed geologic considerations that shall be primary
criteria for the selection of sites in various geologic media.
Such guidelines shall specify factors that qualify or disqualify
any site from development as a repository, including factors pertaining
to the location of valuable natural resources, hydrology, geophysics,
seismic activity, and atomic energy defense activities, proximity
to water supplies, proximity to populations, the effect upon the
rights of users of water, and proximity to components of the National
Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Wilderness Preservation
System, or National Forest Lands. Such guidelines shall take into
consideration the proximity to sites where high-level radioactive
waste and spent nuclear fuel is generated or temporarily stored
and the transportation and safety factors involved in moving such
waste to a repository. Such guidelines shall specify population
factors that will disqualify any site from development as a repository
if any surface facility of such repository would be located (1)
in a highly populated area; or (2) adjacent to an area 1 mile
by 1 mile having a population of not less than 1,000 individuals.
Such guidelines also shall require the Secretary to consider the
cost and impact of transporting to the repository site the solidified
high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel to be disposed of
in the repository and the advantages of regional distribution
in the siting of repositories. Such guidelines shall require the
Secretary to consider the various geologic media in which sites
for repositories may be located and, to the extent practicable,
to recommend sites in different geologic media. The Secretary
shall use guidelines established under this subsection in considering
candidate sites for recommendation under subsection (b). The Secretary
may revise such guidelines from time to time, consistent with
the provisions of this subsection.
<P>
(b) Recommendation by Secretary to the President.
<P>
(1) (A) Following the issuance of guidelines under subsection
(a) and consultation with the Governors of affected States, the
Secretary shall nominate at least 5 sites that he determines suitable
for site characterization for selection of the first repository
site.
<P>
(B) Subsequent to such nomination, the Secretary shall recommend
to the President 3 of the nominated sites not later than January
1, 1985 for characterization as candidate sites.
<P>
(C) Such recommendations under subparagraph (B) shall be consistent
with the provisions of section 305 [42 U.S.C. 10225].
<P>
(D) Each nomination of a site under this subsection shall be accompanied
by an environmental assessment, which shall include a detailed
statement of the basis for such recommendation and of the probable
impacts of the site characterization activities planned for such
site, and a discussion of alternative activities relating to site
characterization that may be undertaken to avoid such impacts.
Such environmental assessment shall include
<P>
(i) an evaluation by the Secretary as to whether such site is
suitable for site characterization under the guidelines established
under subsection (a);
<P>
(ii) an evaluation by the Secretary as to whether such site is
suitable for development as a repository under each such guideline
that does not require site characterization as a prerequisite
for application of such guideline;
<P>
(iii) an evaluation by the Secretary of the effects of the site
characterization activities at such site on the public health
and safety and the environment;
<P>
(iv) a reasonable comparative evaluation by the Secretary of such
site with other sites and locations that have been considered;
<P>
(v) a description of the decision process by which such site was
recommended; and
<P>
(vi) an assessment of the regional and local impacts of locating
the proposed repository at such site.
<P>
(E) The issuance of any environmental assessment under this paragraph
shall be considered to be a final agency action subject to judicial
review in accordance with the provisions of chapter 7 of title
5, United States Code [5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.], and section 119
[42 U.S.C. 10139]. Such judicial review shall be limited to the
sufficiency of such environmental assessment with respect to the
items described in clauses (i) through (vi) of subparagraph (E).
<P>
(F) Each environmental assessment prepared under this paragraph
shall be made available to the public.
<P>
(G) Before nominating a site, the Secretary shall notify the Governor
and legislature of the State in which such site is located, or
the governing body of the affected Indian tribe where such site
is located, as the case may be, of such nomination and the basis
for such nomination.
<P>
(2) Before nominating any site the Secretary shall hold public
hearings in the vicinity of such site to inform the residents
of the area in which such site is located of the proposed nomination
of such site and to receive their comments. At such hearings,
the Secretary shall also solicit and receive any recommendations
of such residents with respect to issues that should be addressed
in the environmental assessment described in paragraph (1) and
the site characterization plan described in section 113(b)(1)
[42 U.S.C. 10133(b)(1)].
<P>
(3) In evaluating the sites nominated under this section prior
to any decision to recommend a site as a candidate site, the Secretary
shall use available geophysical, geologic, geochemical and hydrologic,
and other information and shall not conduct any preliminary borings
or excavations at a site unless (i) such preliminary boring or
excavation activities were in progress upon the date of enactment
of this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983] or (ii) the Secretary certifies
that such available information from other sources, in the absence
of preliminary borings or excavations, will not be adequate to
satisfy applicable requirements of this Act [42 U.S.C. 10101 et
seq.] or any other law: Provided, That preliminary borings or
excavations under this section shall not exceed a diameter of
6 inches.
<P>
(c) Presidential review of recommended candidate sites.
<P>
(1) The President shall review each candidate site recommendation
made by the Secretary under subsection (b). Not later than 60
days after the submission by the Secretary of a recommendation
of a candidate site, the President, in his discretion, may either
approve or disapprove such candidate site, and shall transmit
any such decision to the Secretary and to either the Governor
and legislature of the State in which such candidate site is located,
or the governing body of the affected Indian tribe where such
candidate site is located, as the case may be. If, during such
60-day period, the President fails to approve or disapprove such
candidate site, or fails to invoke his authority under paragraph
(2) to delay his decision, such candidate site shall be considered
to be approved, and the Secretary shall notify such Governor and
legislature, or governing body of the affected Indian tribe, of
the approval of such candidate site by reason of the inaction
of the President.
<P>
(2) The President may delay for not more than 6 months his decision
under paragraph (1) to approve or disapprove a candidate site,
upon determining that the information provided with the recommendation
of the Secretary is insufficient to permit a decision within the
60-day period referred to in paragraph (1). The President may
invoke his authority under this paragraph by submitting written
notice to the Congress, within such 60-day period, of his intent
to invoke such authority. If the President invokes such authority,
but fails to approve or disapprove the candidate site involved
by the end of such 6-month period, such candidate site shall be
considered to be approved, and the Secretary shall notify such
Governor and legislature, or governing body of the affected Indian
tribe, of the approval of such candidate site by reason of the
inaction of the President.
<P>
(d) Preliminary activities. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, each activity of the President or the Secretary under
this section shall be considered to be a preliminary decisionmaking
activity. No such activity shall require the preparation of an
environmental impact statement under section 102(2)(C) of the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)],
or to require any environmental review under subparagraph (E)

is submitted under subsection (b), and annually thereafter until
the date on which such authorization is granted, the Commission
shall submit a report to the Congress describing the proceedings
undertaken through the date of such report with regard to such
application, including a description of
<P>
(1) any major unresolved safety issues, and the explanation of
the Secretary with respect to design and operation plans for resolving
such issues;
<P>
(2) any matters of contention regarding such application; and
<P>
(3) any Commission actions regarding the granting or denial of
such authorization.
<P>
(d) Commission action. The Commission shall consider an application
for a construction authorization for all or part of a repository
in accordance with the laws applicable to such applications, except
that the Commission shall issue a final decision approving or
disapproving the issuance of a construction authorization not
later than the expiration of 3 years after the date of the submission
of such application, except that the Commission may extend such
deadline by not more than 12 months if, not less than 30 days
before such deadline, the Commission complies with the reporting
requirements established in subsection (e)(2). The Commission
decision approving the first such application shall prohibit the
emplacement in the first repository of a quantity of spent fuel
containing in excess of 70,000 metric tons of heavy metal or a
quantity of solidified high-level radioactive waste resulting
from the reprocessing of such a quantity of spent fuel until such
time as a second repository is in operation. In the event that
a monitored retrievable storage facility, approved pursuant to
subtitle C of this Act, shall be located, or is planned to be
located, within 50 miles of the first repository, then the Commission
decision approving the first such application shall prohibit the
emplacement of a quantity of spent fuel containing in excess of
70,000 metric tons of heavy metal or a quantity of solidified
high-level radioactive waste resulting from the reprocessing of
spent fuel in both the repository and monitored retrievable storage
facility until such time as a second repository is in operation.
<P>
(e) Project decision schedule.
<P>
(1) The Secretary shall prepare and update, as appropriate, in

(2) Any Federal agency that determines that it cannot comply with
any deadline in the project decision schedule, or fails to so
comply, shall submit to the Secretary and to the Congress a written
report explaining the reason for its failure or expected failure
to meet such deadline, the reason why such agency could not reach
an agreement with the Secretary, the estimated time for completion
of the activity or activities involved, the associated effect
on its other deadlines in the project decision schedule, and any
recommendations it may have or actions it intends to take regarding
any improvements in its operation or organization, or changes
to its statutory directives or authority, so that it will be able
to mitigate the delay involved. The Secretary, within 30 days
after receiving any such report, shall file with the Congress
his response to such report, including the reasons why the Secretary
could not amend the project decision schedule to accommodate the
Federal agency involved.
<P>

<P>
(4) Any environmental impact statement prepared in connection
with a repository proposed to be constructed by the Secretary
under this subtitle shall, to the extent practicable, be adopted
by the Commission in connection with the issuance by the Commission
of a construction authorization and license for such repository.
To the extent such statement is adopted by the Commission, such
adoption shall be deemed to also satisfy the responsibilities
of the Commission under the National Environmental Policy Act
of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] and no further consideration
shall be required, except that nothing in this subsection shall
affect any independent responsibilities of the Commission to protect
the public health and safety under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954
[42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.].
<P>
(5) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to amend or otherwise
detract from the licensing requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory

<H4><A NAME="SEC131">FINDINGS AND PURPOSES</A></H4>

<P>
Sec. 131. (a) Findings. The Congress finds that
<P>
(1) the persons owning and operating civilian nuclear power reactors
have the primary responsibility for providing interim storage
of spent nuclear fuel from such reactors, by maximizing, to the
extent practical, the effective use of existing storage facilities
at the site of each civilian nuclear power reactor, and by adding
new onsite storage capacity in a timely manner where practical;
<P>
(2) the Federal Government has the responsibility to encourage
and expedite the effective use of existing storage facilities
and the addition of needed new storage capacity at the site of
each civilian nuclear power reactor; and
<P>
(3) the Federal Government has the responsibility to provide,
in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle, not more than
1,900 metric tons of capacity for interim storage of spent nuclear
fuel for civilian nuclear power reactors that cannot reasonably
provide adequate storage capacity at the sites of such reactors
when needed to assure the continued, orderly operation of such
reactors.
<P>
(b) Purposes. The purposes of this subtitle [42 U.S.C 10151 et
seq.] are
<P>
(1) to provide for the utilization of available spent nuclear
fuel pools at the site of each civilian nuclear power reactor
to the extent practical and the addition of new spent nuclear
fuel storage capacity where practical at the site of such reactor;
and
<P>
(2) to provide, in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle
[42 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.], for the establishment of a federally
owned and operated system for the interim storage of spent nuclear
fuel at one or more facilities owned by the Federal Government
with not more than 1,900 metric tons of capacity to prevent disruptions
in the orderly operation of any civilian nuclear power reactor
that cannot reasonably provide adequate spent nuclear fuel storage
capacity at the site of such reactor when needed.
<P>
[42 U.S.C. 10151]

SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL</A></H4>

<P>
Sec. 132. The Secretary, the Commission, and other authorized
Federal officials shall each take such actions as such official
considers necessary to encourage and expedite the effective use
of available storage, and necessary additional storage, at the
site of each civilian nuclear power reactor consistent with
<P>
(1) the protection of the public health and safety, and the environment;
<P>
(2) economic considerations;
<P>
(3) continued operation of such reactor;
<P>
(4) any applicable provisions of law; and
<P>
(5) the views of the population surrounding such reactor.

<H4><A NAME="SEC134">LICENSING OF FACILITY EXPANSIONS AND TRANSSHIPMENTS</A>
</H4>

<P>
Sec. 134. (a) Oral argument. In any Commission hearing under section
189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2239] on an application
for a license, or for an amendment to an existing license, filed
after the date of the enactment of this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983],
to expand the spent nuclear fuel storage capacity at the site
of a civilian nuclear power reactor, through the use of high-density
fuel storage racks, fuel rod compaction, the transshipment of
spent nuclear fuel to another civilian nuclear power reactor within
the same utility system, the construction of additional spent
nuclear fuel pool capacity or dry storage capacity, or by other
means, the Commission shall, at the request of any party, provide
an opportunity for oral argument with respect to any matter which
the Commission determines to be in controversy among the parties.
The oral argument shall be preceded by such discovery procedures
as the rules of the Commission shall provide. The Commission shall
require each party, including the Commission staff, to submit
in written form, at the time of the oral argument, a summary of
the facts, data, and arguments upon which such party proposes
to rely that are known at such time to such party. Only facts
and data in the form of sworn testimony or written submission
may be relied upon by the parties during oral argument. Of the
materials that may be submitted by the parties during oral argument,
the Commission shall only consider those facts and data that are
submitted in the form of sworn testimony or written submission.
<P>
(b) Adjudicatory hearing.
<P>
(1) At the conclusion of any oral argument under subsection (a),
the Commission shall designate any disputed question of fact,
together with any remaining questions of law, for resolution in
an adjudicatory hearing only if it determines that
<P>
(A) there is a genuine and substantial dispute of fact which can
only be resolved with sufficient accuracy by the introduction
of evidence in an adjudicatory hearing; and
<P>
(B) the decision of the Commission is likely to depend in whole
or in part on the resolution of such dispute.
<P>
(2) In making a determination under this subsection, the Commission
<P>
(A) shall designate in writing the specific facts that are in
genuine and substantial dispute, the reason why the decision of
the agency is likely to depend on the resolution of such facts,
and the reason why an adjudicatory hearing is likely to resolve
the dispute; and
<P>
(B) shall not consider
<P>
(i) any issue relating to the design, construction, or operation
of any civilian nuclear power reactor already licensed to operate
at such site, or any civilian nuclear power reactor for which
a construction permit has been granted at such site, unless the
Commission determines that any such issue substantially affects
the design, construction, or operation of the facility or activity
for which such license application, authorization, or amendment
is being considered; or
<P>
(ii) any siting or design issue fully considered and decided by
the Commission in connection with the issuance of a construction
permit or operating license for a civilian nuclear power reactor
at such site, unless (I) such issue results from any revision
of siting or design criteria by the Commission following such
decision; and (II) the Commission determines that such issue substantially
affects the design, construction, or operation of the facility
or activity for which such license application, authorization,
or amendment is being considered.
<P>
(3) The provisions of paragraph (2)(B) shall apply only with respect
to licenses, authorizations, or amendments to licenses or authorizations,
applied for under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2011
et seq.] before December 31, 2005.
<P>
(4) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the first
application for a license or license amendment received by the
Commission to expand onsite spent fuel storage capacity by the
use of a new technology not previously approved for use at any
nuclear powerplant by the Commission.
<P>
(c) Judicial review. No court shall hold unlawful or set aside
a decision of the Commission in any proceeding described in subsection
(a) because of a failure by the Commission to use a particular
procedure pursuant to this section unless
<P>
(1) an objection to the procedure used was presented to the Commission
in a timely fashion or there are extraordinary circumstances that
excuse the failure to present a timely objection; and
<P>
(2) the court finds that such failure has precluded a fair consideration
and informed resolution of a significant issue of the proceeding
taken as a whole.

(g) Criteria for determining adequacy of available storage capacity.
Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this
Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], the Commission pursuant to section
553 of the Administrative Procedures Act, shall propose, by rule,
procedures and criteria for making the determination required
by subsection (b) that a person owning and operating a civilian
nuclear power reactor cannot reasonably provide adequate spent
nuclear fuel storage capacity at the civilian nuclear power reactor
site when needed to ensure the continued orderly operation of
such reactor. Such criteria shall ensure the maintenance of a
full core reserve storage capability at the site of such reactor
unless the Commission determines that maintenance of such capability
is not necessary for the continued orderly operation of such reactor.
Such criteria shall identify the feasibility of reasonably providing
such adequate spent nuclear fuel storage capacity, taking into
account economic, technical, regulatory, and public health and
safety factors, through the use of high-density fuel storage racks,
fuel rod compaction, transshipment of spent nuclear fuel to another
civilian nuclear power reactor within the same utility system,
construction of additional spent nuclear fuel pool capacity, or
such other technologies as may be approved by the Commission.
<P>
(h) Application. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nothing
in this Act [42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.] shall be construed to encourage,
authorize, or require the private or Federal use, purchase, lease,
or other acquisition of any storage facility located away from
the site of any civilian nuclear power reactor and not owned by
the Federal Government on the date of the enactment of this Act
[enacted Jan. 7, 1983].
<P>
(i) Coordination with research and development program. To the
extent available, and consistent with the provisions of this section,
the Secretary shall provide spent nuclear fuel for the research
and development program authorized in section 217 from spent nuclear
fuel received by the Secretary for storage under this section.
Such spent nuclear fuel shall not be subject to the provisions
of subsection (e).

Secretary shall make annual impact assistance payments to a State
or appropriate unit of local government, or both, in order to
mitigate social or economic impacts occasioned by the establishment
and subsequent operation of any interim storage capacity within
the jurisdictional boundaries of such government or governments
and authorized under this subtitle [42 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.]:
Provided, however, That such impact assistance payments shall
not exceed (A) ten per centum of the costs incurred in paragraphs
(1) and (2), or (B) $15 per kilogram of spent fuel, whichever
is less;
<P>
(2) Payments made available to States and units of local government
pursuant to this section shall be
<P>
(A) allocated in a fair and equitable manner with a priority to
those States or units of local government suffering the most severe
impacts; and
<P>
(B) utilized by States or units of local governments only for
(i) planning, (ii) construction and maintenance of public services,
(iii) provision of public services related to the providing of
such interim storage authorized under this title [42 U.S.C. 10121
et seq.], and (iv) compensation for loss of taxable property equivalent
to that if the storage had been provided under private ownership.
<P>
(3) Such payments shall be subject to such terms and conditions
as the Secretary determines necessary to ensure that the purposes
of this subsection shall be achieved. The Secretary shall issue
such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions
of this subsection.
<P>
(4) Payments under this subsection shall be made available solely
from the fees determined under subsection (a).
<P>
(5) The Secretary is authorized to consult with States and appropriate
units of local government in advance of commencement establishment
of storage capacity authorized under this subtitle [42 U.S.C.
10151 et seq.] in an effort to determine the level of the payment

subsection.
<P>
(6) As used in this subsection the term unit of local government
means a county, parish, township, municipality, and shall include
a borough existing in the State of Alaska on the date of the enactment
of this subsection [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], and any other unit
of government below the State level which is a unit of general
government as determined by the Secretary.
<P>
(f) Administration of Storage Fund.
<P>
(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall hold the Storage Fund
and, after consultation with the Secretary, annually report to
the Congress on the financial condition and operations of the
Storage Fund during the preceding fiscal year.
<P>
(2) The Secretary shall submit the budget of the Storage Fund
to the Office of Management and Budget triennially along with
the budget of the Department of Energy submitted at such time
in accordance with chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code
[31 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.]. The budget of the Storage Fund shall
consist of estimates made by the Secretary of expenditures from

at any time amounts in excess of current needs, the Secretary
may request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such amounts,
or any portion of such amounts as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate, in obligations of the United States
<P>
(A) having maturities determined by the Secretary of the Treasury
to be appropriate to the needs of the Storage Fund; and
<P>
(B) bearing interest at rates determined to be appropriate by
the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current
average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of
the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable
to the maturities of such investments, except that the interest
rate on such investments shall not exceed the average interest
rate applicable to existing borrowings.
<P>
(4) Receipts, proceeds, and recoveries realized by the Secretary
under this section, and expenditures of amounts from the Storage
Fund, shall be exempt from annual apportionment under the provisions
of subchapter II of chapter 15 of title 31, United States Code
[31 U.S.C. 1511 et seq.].
<P>
(5) If at any time the moneys available in the Storage Fund are
insufficient to enable the Secretary to discharge his responsibilities
under this subtitle [31 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.], the Secretary shall
issue to the Secretary of the Treasury obligations in such forms
and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such
terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the Secretary and
the Secretary of the Treasury. The total of such obligations shall
not exceed amounts provided in appropriation Acts. Redemption
of such obligations shall be made by the Secretary from moneys
available in the Storage Fund. Such obligations shall bear interest
at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, which shall
be not less than a rate determined by taking into consideration
the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations
of the United States of comparable maturities during the month
preceding the issuance of the obligations under this paragraph.
The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any issued obligations,
and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized
to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale
of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, United
States Code [31 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.], and the purposes for which
securities may be issued under such Act are extended to include
any purchase of such obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury
may at any time sell any of the obligations acquired by him under
this paragraph. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary
of the Treasury of obligations under this paragraph shall be treated
as public debt transactions of the United States.
<P>
(6) Any appropriations made available to the Storage Fund for
any purpose described in subsection (d) shall be repaid into the
general fund of the Treasury, together with interest from the
date of availability of the appropriations until the date of repayment.
Such interest shall be paid on the cumulative amount of appropriations
available to the Storage Fund, less the average undisbursed cash
balance in the Storage Fund account during the fiscal year involved.
The rate of such interest shall be determined by the Secretary
of the Treasury taking into consideration the average market yield
during the month preceding each fiscal year on outstanding marketable
obligations of the United States of comparable maturity. Interest
payments may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary of
the Treasury, but any interest payments so deferred shall themselves
bear interest.

<P>
Sec. 141. (a) Findings. The Congress finds that
<P>
(1) long-term storage of high-level radioactive waste or spent
nuclear fuel in monitored retrievable storage facilities is an
option for providing safe and reliable management of such waste
or spent fuel;
<P>
(2) the executive branch and the Congress should proceed as expeditiously
as possible to consider fully a proposal for construction of one

<H4><A NAME="SEC213">IDENTIFICATION OF SITES</A></H4>

<P>
Sec. 213. (a) Guidelines. Not later than 6 months after the date
of the enactment of this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983] and notwithstanding
the failure of other agencies to promulgate standards pursuant
to applicable law, the Secretary, in consultation with the Commission,
the Director of the Geological Survey, the Administrator, the
Council on Environmental Quality, and such other Federal agencies
as the Secretary considers appropriate, is authorized to issue,
pursuant to section 553 of title 5, United States Code [5 U.S.C.
553], general guidelines for the selection of a site for a test
and evaluation facility. Under such guidelines the Secretary shall
specify factors that qualify or disqualify a site for development
as a test and evaluation facility, including factors pertaining
to the location of valuable natural resources, hydrogeophysics,
seismic activity, and atomic energy defense activities, proximity
to water supplies, proximity to populations, the effect upon the
rights of users of water, and proximity to components of the National
Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Wilderness Preservation
System, or National Forest Lands. Such guidelines shall require
the Secretary to consider the various geologic media in which
the site for a test and evaluation facility may be located and,
to the extent practicable, to identify sites in different geologic
media. The Secretary shall use guidelines established under this
subsection in considering and selecting sites under this title
[42 U.S.C. 10191 et seq.].
<P>
(b) Site identification by the Secretary.
<P>
(1) Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this
Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], and following promulgation of guidelines
under subsection (a), the Secretary is authorized to identify
3 or more sites, at least 2 of which shall be in different geologic
media in the continental United States, and at least 1 of which
shall be in media other than salt. Subject to Commission requirements,
the Secretary shall give preference to sites for the test and
evaluation facility in media possessing geochemical characteristics
that retard aqueous transport of radionuclides. In order to provide
a greater possible protection of public health and safety as operating
experience is gained at the test and evaluation facility, and
with the exception of the primary areas under review by the Secretary
on the date of the enactment of this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983]
for the location of a test and evaluation facility or repository,
all sites identified under this subsection shall be more than
15 statute miles from towns having a population of greater than
1,000 persons as determined by the most recent census unless such
sites contain high-level radioactive waste prior to identification
under this title [42 U.S.C. 10191 et seq.]. Each identification
of a site shall be supported by an environmental assessment, which
shall include a detailed statement of the basis for such identification
and of the probable impacts of the siting research activities
planned for such site, and a discussion of alternative activities
relating to siting research that may be undertaken to avoid such
impacts. Such environmental assessment shall include
<P>
(A) an evaluation by the Secretary as to whether such site is
suitable for siting research under the guidelines established
under subsection (a);
<P>
(B) an evaluation by the Secretary of the effects of the siting
research activities at such site on the public health and safety
and the environment;
<P>
(C) a reasonable comparative evaluation by the Secretary of such
site with other sites and locations that have been considered;
<P>
(D) a description of the decision process by which such site was
recommended; and
<P>
(E) an assessment of the regional and local impacts of locating
the proposed test and evaluation facility at such site.
<P>
(2) When the Secretary identifies a site, the Secretary shall
as soon as possible notify the Governor of the State in which
such site is located, or the governing body of the affected Indian
tribe where such site is located, of such identification and the
basis of such identification. Additional sites for the location
of the test and evaluation facility authorized in section 302(d)
[42 U.S.C. 10222(d)] may be identified after such 1 year period,
following the same procedure as if such sites had been identified
within such period.

<P>
Sec. 217. (a) Purpose. Not later than 64 months after the date
of the enactment of this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], the Secretary
is authorized to, to the extent practicable, begin at a site evaluated
under section 214 [42 U.S.C. 10194], as part of and as an extension
of siting research activities of such site under such section
[42 U.S.C. 10194], the mining and construction of a test and evaluation
facility. Prior to the mining and construction of such facility,
the Secretary shall prepare an environmental assessment. The purpose
of such facility shall be
<P>
(1) to supplement and focus the repository site characterization
process;
<P>
(2) to provide the conditions under which known technological
components can be integrated to demonstrate a functioning repository-like
system;
<P>
(3) to provide a means of identifying, evaluating, and resolving
potential repository licensing issues that could not be resolved
during the siting research program under section 212 [42 U.S.C.
10192];
<P>
(4) to validate, under actual conditions, the scientific models
used in the design of a repository;
<P>
(5) to refine the design and engineering of repository components
and systems and to confirm the predicted behavior of such components
and systems;
<P>
(6) to supplement the siting data, the generic and specific geological
characteristics developed under section 214 [42 U.S.C. 10194]
relating to isolating disposal materials in the physical environment
of a repository;
<P>
(7) to evaluate the design concepts for packaging, handling, and
emplacement of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear
fuel at the design rate; and
<P>
(8) to establish operating capability without exposing workers
to excessive radiation.
<P>
(b) Design. The Secretary shall design each test and evaluation
facility
<P>
(1) to be capable of receiving not more than 100 full-sized canisters
of solidified high-level radioactive waste (which canisters shall
not exceed an aggregate weight of 100 metric tons), except that
spent nuclear fuel may be used instead of such waste if such waste
cannot be obtained under reasonable conditions;
<P>
(2) to permit full retrieval of solidified high-level radioactive
waste, or other radioactive material used by the Secretary for
testing, upon completion of the technology demonstration activities;
and
<P>
(3) based upon the principle that the high-level radioactive waste,
spent nuclear fuel, or other radioactive material involved shall
be isolated from the biosphere in such a way that the initial
isolation is provided by engineered barriers functioning as a
system with the geologic environment.
<P>
(c) Operation.

(1) Not later than 88 months after the date of the enactment of
this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], the Secretary shall begin an
in situ testing program at the test and evaluation facility in
accordance with the mission plan developed under section 301 [42
U.S.C. 10221], for purposes of
<P>
(A) conducting in situ tests of bore hole sealing, geologic media
fracture sealing, and room closure to establish the techniques
and performance for isolation of high-level radioactive waste,
spent nuclear fuel, or other radioactive materials from the biosphere;
<P>
(B) conducting in situ tests with radioactive sources and materials
to evaluate and improve reliable models for radionuclide migration,
absorption, and containment within the engineered barriers and
geologic media involved, if the Secretary finds there is reasonable
assurance that such radioactive sources and materials will not

(C) conducting in situ tests to evaluate and improve models for
ground water or brine flow through fractured geologic media;
<P>
(D) conducting in situ tests under conditions representing the
real time and the accelerated time behavior of the engineered
barriers within the geologic environment involved;
<P>
(E) conducting in situ tests to evaluate the effects of heat and
pressure on the geologic media involved, on the hydrology of the
surrounding area, and on the integrity of the disposal packages;
<P>
(F) conducting in situ tests under both normal and abnormal repository
conditions to establish safe design limits for disposal packages
and to determine the effects of the gross release of radionuclides
into surroundings, and the effects of various credible failure
modes, including
<P>
(i) seismic events leading to the coupling of aquifers through
the test and evaluation facility;
<P>
(ii) thermal pulses significantly greater than the maximum calculated;
and
<P>
(iii) human intrusion creating a direct pathway to the biosphere.

<P>
Sec. 801. 42 USC 10141 note.
<P>
(a) Environmental Protection Agency Standards.
<P>
(1) Promulgation. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 121(a)
of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 [42 U.S.C. 210141(a)],
section 161 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2201(b)],
and any other authority of the Administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency to set generally applicable standards for the
Yucca Mountain site, the Administrator shall, based upon and consistent
with the findings and recommendations of the National Academy
of Sciences, promulgate, by rule, public health and safety standards
for protection of the public from releases from radioactive materials
stored or disposed of in the repository at the Yucca Mountain
site. Such standards shall prescribe the maximum annual effective
dose equivalent to individual members of the public from releases
to the accessible environment from radioactive materials stored
or disposed of in the repository. The standards shall be promulgated
not later than 1 year after the Administrator receives the findings
and recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences under
paragraph (2) and shall be the only such standards applicable
to the Yucca Mountain site.
<P>
(2) Study by National Academy of Sciences. Within 90 days after
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall
contract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study
to provide, by not later than December 31, 1993, findings and
recommendations on reasonable standards for protection of the
public health and safety, including
<P>
(A) whether a health-based standard based upon doses to individual
members of the public from releases to the accessible environment
(as that term is defined in the regulations contained in subpart
B of part 191 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as in
effect on November 18, 1985) will provide a reasonable standard
for protection of the health and safety of the general public;
<P>
(B) whether it is reasonable to assume that a system for post-closure
oversight of the repository can be developed, based upon active
institutional controls, that will prevent an unreasonable risk
of breaching the repository s engineered or geologic barriers
or increasing the exposure of individual members of the public
to radiation beyond allowable limits; and
<P>
(C) whether it is possible to make scientifically supportable
predictions of the probability that the repository s engineered
or geologic barriers will be breached as a result of human intrusion
over a period of 10,000 years.
<P>
(3) Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply
to the Yucca Mountain site, rather than any other authority of
the Administrator to set generally applicable standards for radiation
protection.
<P>
(b) Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements and criteria.
<P>
(1) Modifications. Not later than l year after the Administrator
promulgates standards under subsection (a), the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission shall, by rule, modify its technical requirements and
criteria under section 121(b) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
of 1982 [42 U.S.C. 10141(b)], as necessary, to be consistent with
the Administrator s standards promulgated under subsection (a).
<P>
(2) Required assumptions. The Commission s requirements and criteria
shall assume, to the extent consistent with the findings and recommendations
of the National Academy of Sciences, that, following repository
closure, the inclusion of engineered barriers and the Secretary
s post-closure oversight of the Yucca Mountain site, in accordance
with subsection (c), shall be sufficient to
<P>
(A) prevent any activity at the site that poses an unreasonable
risk of breaching the repository s engineered or geologic barriers;
and
<P>
(B) prevent any increase in the exposure of individual members
of the public to radiation beyond allowable limits.
<P>
(c) Post-closure oversight. Following repository closure, the
Secretary of Energy shall continue to oversee the Yucca Mountain
site to prevent any activity at the site that poses an unreasonable
risk of
<P>
(1) breaching the repository s engineered or geologic barriers;
or
<P>
(2) increasing the exposure of individual members of the public
to radiation beyond allowable limits.

The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) is comprised of all 50 states, two U.S.
Territories (Guam and American Samoa), twelve Canadian Provinces and Territories, and Mexico. 
CVSA objectives are to enhance safety of commercial vehicles, improve commercial vehicle
operation, minimize schedule delays, ensure effective allocation of resources, and provide
reciprocity for vehicle inspections between states to avoid duplication of efforts. CVSA members
are responsible for the administration and enforcement of motor carrier safety laws. The alliance is
supported by organizations and business enterprises involved in motor carrier safety whose
interests are mutual or compatible with CVSA and its objectives.  There are more than 200
associate members which facilitate the maintenance of an industry perspective.  In cooperation
with the U.S. Department of Energy, CVSA developed uniform inspection standards for drivers,
vehicles, and loads to be used for inspection of spent fuel, high-level radioactive and transuranic
waste transportation campaigns.  It is presently involved in training inspectors as well as conducting
a pilot program to test the standards.

Assistance and Funding
<p>
<b>AGENCY:</b> Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management,
Department of Energy.
<p>
<b>ACTION:</b> Notice of inquiry; supplemental information.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="summary">
<b>SUMMARY:</b> The Department of Energy (the Department) intends
to implement a program of technical assistance and funds to
States for training for public safety officials of appropriate
units of local government and Indian tribes through whose
jurisdiction the Secretary of Energy plans to transport spent
nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste. The training would
cover both safe routine transportation procedures and emergency
response procedures. The Department issued a Notice of Inquiry in
the Federal Register on January 3, 1995 (60 FR 99) which briefly
describes various options to delineate Section 180(c) of the 
Nuclear Waste Policy Act policy and procedures. Members of the
public were invited to submit comments on the Notice of Inquiry.
In the March 14, 1995, Federal Register (60 FR 13715) the
Department extended the deadline for comments to May 18, 1995. In
a continuing effort to include stakeholders in pre-decisional
discussions, the Department has developed additional information,
presented below, that discusses options for policy and procedures
and their applicability to the Section 180(c) mandate. The
discussion below does not reflect final Departmental policy. The
Department welcomes comments in response to this Federal Register
notice on how best to implement the Section 180(c) program.
Comments to the previous notice will also be considered.  The
Department intends to prepare a Notice of Proposed Policy and
Procedures for the Section 180(c) program in 1996.

<b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b>
<p>
<b>I. Purpose and Need for Agency Action</b>
<p>
Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (42
U.S.C.  10101 et seq.) (NWPA or ``the Act''), the Department of
Energy is responsible for disposal of civilian spent nuclear
fuel and high-level radioactive waste in a deep geologic
repository. The Department is also responsible for managing the
disposal of spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power
plants and high-level nuclear waste, and for possible monitored
retrievable storage of spent nuclear fuel prior to disposal.
Additionally, the Department is responsible for transportation
of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste to the Department's
disposal or storage sites. To carry out these responsibilities,
the Department needs to implement Section 180(c)of the Act.
Section 180(c) of the Act states:
<p><pre>
    The Secretary [of Energy] shall provide technical assistance
    and funds to States for training for public safety officials 

    of appropriate units of local government and Indian tribes   

    through whose jurisdiction the Secretary plans to transport  

    spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste under     

    subtitle A or under subtitle C. Training shall cover         

    procedures required for safe routine transportation of these 

    materials, as well as procedures for dealing with emergency  

    response situations. The Waste Fund shall be the source of   

    funds for work carried out under this subsection.[42  U.S.C. 

    10175]

<p></pre>
In the interest of obtaining input from the broadest range of
stakeholders, the Department began to develop the Section 180(c)
program by publishing a Notice of Inquiry in the Federal
Register on January 3, 1995 (60 FR 99). The Notice of Inquiry
briefly described various policy and administrative options the
Department was considering and invited members of the public to
submit comments. In response to comments requesting more
information on these options, the Department is presenting
additional information in this Notice of Inquiry.
<p>
The analysis presented here contains three main sections:
Guiding Principles for Section 180(c) Policy and Procedures,
Options for Section 180(c) Policy and Procedures, and Summary of
Public Comments received in response to the January 3, 1995,
Notice of Inquiry.
<p>
<b>II. Guiding Principles for Section 180(c) Policy and
Procedures</b>
<p>
Section 180(c) requires the Department to provide financial
and technical assistance for training. Within this mandate,
specific training elements must be addressed. Training must
encompass procedures for both emergency response and safe
routine transportation for public safety officials and
appropriate units of local government and Indian tribes through
whose jurisdiction the Secretary plans to transport fuel or
high-level radioactive waste.
<p>
While the mechanism for distributing the funding and
technical assistance for training is not specifically provided
for in the Act, the legislative history (S. Rep. No. 152, 100th
Cong., 1987) of this section suggests that Congress intended for
the Department to provide direct funding to States and they,
rather than the Department, would determine how best to allocate
the funds. The Department will retain the responsibility of
ensuring that Section 180(c) funds are distributed consistent
with the NWPA.
<p>
In addition, the Department has identified several guiding 
principles that it intends to follow in carrying out the
requirements  of Section 180(c). The following are not listed in
any particular order.
    <ul>
    <li>The Department recognizes that State, tribal, and
local jurisdictions vary in organizational and staffing
structures, philosophies on roles and responsibilities of public
safety officials, and levels of preparedness and training. The
Department will strive to develop a program with enough
flexibility to accommodate the wide variety of State, tribal,
and local assistance needs associated with NWPA shipments and
Departmental responsibilities under Section 180(c).
    <li>Where possible, the Section 180(c) program should be
 integrated into established Federal, State, and tribal training 
structures.
    <li> The Department's responsibilities under other
statutory authorities must be considered in the Department's
options evaluation.  These Departmental responsibilities exist
under the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP),
coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the
Department's 5500 series Orders, and other radiological
emergency preparedness and response programs.
    <li> The Department will strive to minimize the Section
180(c) program's administrative burden on the Department and
recipient jurisdictions.
    <li> Distribution or use of Section 180(c) funds must be
in  accordance with restrictions applicable to the Nuclear Waste
Fund as indicated in the NWPA.
</ul>
<p>
<b>III. Options For Section 180(c) Policy and Procedures</b>
<p>
This section is divided into two parts. The first part
discusses a range of policy options that, when defined, will
largely characterize the scope of the Section 180(c) program.
These policy options are inextricably linked to how the
Department will define the training goals and terms relevant to
Section 180(c). Therefore, the policy options are discussed in
terms of: (1) Emergency response training goals, (2) Safe
routine transportation training goals and definitions,  (3)
Technical assistance definitions, (4) Eligibility criteria, (5) 
Funding allocation formulas, and (6) Restrictions on use of
funds.
<p>
Second part discusses the procedural options through which
Section  180(c) assistance might be administered. These options
include other  Federal training programs that the Department may
be able to use to  meet Section 180(c) requirements and funding
mechanisms that may be used to distribute assistance.
<p>
<i>A. Discussion of Policy Options</i> 
<p>
<i>Emergency Response Training Goals</i>
Jurisdictions have differences in philosophy, in division of 
responsibility, and in levels of resources when planning for
hazardous materials emergency response procedures. Some
jurisdictions want those officials responsible for initial
response action (``first responders'') at the local level to
have the highest levels of training and equipment to prepare for
all events. Conversely, other jurisdictions direct resources to
more specialized response capabilities of regional or State
hazardous materials response teams and provide first-on-scene
personnel and first responders with only awareness training. The
Department will take both these positions into account when
delineating the scope of the Section 180(c) program. 
<p>
<i>Safe Routine Transportation Definitions and Training Goals</i>
<p>
The Federal government and State, tribes and local
governments currently engage in a range of activities related to
safe routine transportation and accompanying training. Part of
setting the scope of Section 180(c) will be identifying what in
the existing range is appropriate for NWPA shipments. Most safe
transportation activities are designated the responsibility of
the shipper and carrier by Federal regulatory action. However,
States and tribes, in varying degrees, perform conveyance
inspections and impose restrictions and penalties as part of
safe transportation and its enforcement. The Federal government 
carries out three types of activities related to safe routine 
transportation. The Department of Transportation sets regulations
for driver qualifications, hours of operation, labeling and
placarding and related activities. They also conduct the Motor
Carrier Safety Assistance Program discussed later in this paper 
that provides funding to encourage States to enforce uniform
motor carrier safety and hazardous materials regulations. In
addition, the Department of Energy has implemented stringent
driver qualifications and vehicle inspection standards for the
eventual shipments to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near
Carlsbad, New Mexico. State and tribal regulatory authority for
safe transportation inspections or enforcement is much more
limited for rail transportation than for highway transportation.
<p>    
Some potential definitions of safe, routine transportation
have been developed by the Department and stakeholder groups.
The two definitions listed below may not be comprehensive and
additional activities will be considered when defining safe
routine transportation. Through such definitions, training needs
may be better identified and provided for in a Section 180(c)
program.
<p>
Proposed definition from <i>Strategy \1\</i> document: ``Safe,
routine transportation is the condition of incident-free
transportation. It involves the inspection and enforcement of
shipments through State, Tribal, and local jurisdictions. Safe
routine highway transportation is characterized by adequate
vehicle, driver, and package inspection, and enforcement of the
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and the Hazardous
Materials Regulations. Rail and barge transportation regulations
include the Federal Railroad Administration and Coast Guard 
regulations. Compliance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission
requirements for prenotification and physical protection also
contributes to safe, routine transportation.''

Provide Training Assistance to State, Tribal, and Local
Governments, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management,

<hr>
<p>
Proposed definition from Transportation External
Coordination  Working Group \2\: ``Safe Routine Transportation is
the uneventful movement, from origin to destination, of
hazardous materials in a manner that does not present an undue
risk to human health or the environment and is in compliance
with applicable Federal, State, tribal and local laws and
regulations.'' If this definition is chosen, the word
``hazardous'' will be replaced by the words ``radioactive
waste''. 
<p>
<hr>
    \2\ The Transportation External Coordination Working Group is
a  group of national and regional organizations that participates
in the Department's efforts to identify significant issues
related to the transportation of hazardous and radioactive
materials, recommend activities to resolve those issues, and
implement appropriate activities as Transportation External
Coordination Working Group tasks. All meetings are open to the
public.
<hr>

<p>
<i>Technical Assistance Definitions</i>
<p>
The Department needs to determine what constitutes
``technical  assistance'' as it applies to the Section 180(c)
program. As with safe routine transportation, technical
assistance has been widely discussed in the Transportation
External Coordination Working Group and other forums where the
Department and stakeholders discuss transportation issues. The
following illustrate a range of possible definitions of the term
``technical assistance''.
<p>
Proposed definition from Strategy document: ``Technical
assistance is assistance that the Secretary of Energy can
provide that is unique to the Department to aid training that
will cover procedures for the safe, routine transportation and
emergency response situations during the transport of spent
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. 
<p>
If a definition of technical assistance is provided in the 
implementation of Section 117 of the Hazardous Materials
Transportation Uniform Safety Act (HMTUSA), OCRWM will use that
definition for future planning regarding emergency situations.''
<p>
Note: The Department of Transportation (DOT) does not provide
a definition of technical assistance in the HMTUSA regulations.
<p>
Proposed definition from Transportation External Coordination
Working Group: ``The term <i>Technical Assistance</i> as it is
used in Section  180(c) implies that the Department of Energy
will, in general, provide planning guidance, training support,
available definitions of technical  standards and criteria,
practical support, and expertise to ensure that  State and tribal
governments are trained for safe routine  transportation
practices as well as capable of responding to spent  nuclear fuel
and high-level waste transportation emergencies within  their
jurisdictions. More specifically, activities may include aid in 
developing, implementing, and evaluating readiness and response
plans;  assistance in developing, conducting and evaluating
exercises and  training programs, support for coordination
between neighboring groups, coordination between other government
agency programs, and for public information and education
efforts; on-site response support in the event of an accident or
incident; and logistical and scientific expertise for recovery,
reentry, and remediation activities at an emergency site.
Technical assistance may include activities that monitor and
assess the capabilities of groups in order to make funding
decisions. Financial assistance or direct funding, however, is
considered to be beyond the scope of this definition.''
<p>
Proposed definition from the Council of State Governments 
Midwestern Office: ``The term <i>Technical Assistance</i> as it
is used in  Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act means
a variety of  activities designed to ensure that state, tribal,
and local governments are trained for safe routine transportation
practices as well as responding to transportation emergencies
within their jurisdictions, including but not limited to planning
guidance, training support, practical support, funding of
pre-identified equipment, and expertise.'' 
<p>
<i>Eligibility Criteria</i>
<p>
While the NWPA clearly directs the Department to provide
technical assistance and funds to States for training for public
safety officials of appropriate units of local government and
Indian tribes through whose jurisdiction the Secretary plans to
transport spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste, a
key determination is the eligibility of jurisdictions in light
of the shipment schedule throughout the life of the shipment
program.
<p>
The Department has stated previously that implementation of
the Section 180(c) program will begin three to five years prior
to shipments. Although the Department has not yet selected
routes or final disposal or interim storage sites, current
contracts with utilities identify a sequence of acceptance from
utility sites. Eligibility may be tied to transportation
activity within a jurisdiction.  Alternatively, all jurisdictions
could receive assistance in the first year and throughout a
Section 180(c) program. The Department must consider how
eligibility may be tied to transportation activity both before
shipments begin and in those cases of years where there is no 
transportation activity planned through a particular
jurisdiction.
<p>
<i>Funding Allocation Formulas</i>
<p>
A funding allocation formula is another element of the
Section  180(c) program whose definition might assist in
establishing the scope of the program. A funding allocation
formula is often the primary tool in a grants program identifying
the variables that affect the amount of funding to go to a 
particular recipient. A formula may identify a percentage of a
pool that has been appropriated for an entire program or identify

qualification for predetermined amounts. The formula may identify
a single amount for each recipient or a series of smaller amounts
for the recipient to use toward specified goals.
<p>
For the implementation of Section 180(c), funding allocation
may be  based on a variety of factors. Some of these factors
include the following:
<p>
<b>Shipment miles.</b> This is an estimation of miles that a
shipment would cover through a jurisdiction combined with the
frequency of shipments. A slightly different approach would
include route miles.  This estimation is a measure of the length
of a route through a jurisdiction but does not include frequency
of shipments. The two measurements produce different results.
Using shipment miles would imply that two jurisdictions with
routes of equal length would receive different funding levels if
one jurisdiction experienced a higher number of shipments
compared to the other.
<p>
<b>Number of affected jurisdictions.</b> Because training is
targeted for people rather than mileage, the identification of
the number of groups at the State, local, or tribal level that
should receive assistance may be an effective way to determine
funding. Using this measure, allocation could effectively mirror
highly populated metropolitan areas and less populated rural
areas. However, the number of affected jurisdictions may prove
too difficult to defend, particularly when considering the
differing training goals of dissimilar areas. As an example,
areas of higher population may have more emergency response 
personnel to train, but in general they may already be better
trained  and have considerably smaller response areas. Rural
emergency response jurisdictions may cover considerably wider
areas with a much smaller response group.
<p>    
<b>Population</b> may be a factor in funding allocation as it
indicates the number of people along a route of a particular
shipment. However, this implies areas of lower population would
receive lower levels of assistance and those with higher
populations would receive more.  Including a measure of
population in an allocation formula may be more effective if used
in conjunction with other measures.
<p>
<b>Agreements between neighboring jurisdictions.</b> In some
cases, a  State or tribe not receiving funding in a given year
may still share some responsibility with neighboring States or
tribes that do receive funding. An allocation may include a
provision for additional cooperative activities in these cases.
However, it is also conceivable that States and tribes would be
asked to rely on their existing cooperative agreements.
<p>
<b>Annual timing of funding.</b> The Department has stated that 
implementation should begin three to five years prior to
shipments but some recipients may want to apply the bulk of
assistance closer to a potential shipment date to ensure the
highest possible training retention. Assistance may be provided
at the start of the program to all recipients or it may be
linked to transportation activity in a recipient's jurisdiction.
A combination of these two possibilities may provide basic
assistance for all recipients at the program's start and 
additional, more specific assistance based on transportation
activity within the jurisdictions.
<p>    
<b>Designation of a proportion of the assistance</b> for training
in  specific areas. For example, funding could be divided by the
formula  for training in each mode of transportation, i.e., rail
or highway.  Likewise, it could be divided into assistance for
routine  transportation training and assistance for emergency
response training.  The Department may also choose to leave
decisions to recipients on the  specific areas of funding.
<p>
<i>Restrictions on Use of Funds</i>
<p>
A Section 180(c) program may include some restrictions on the
use of funds to ensure that the Department's intentions for
direction and administration of the program are met. Any
restrictions will also  impact the program's scope. 
<p>
Funding restrictions may affect the choice of training courses,
division of funds for local governments, or coordination
activities.  Training costs may be limited to tuition for
Department-approved  courses, or recipients may be able to
develop or choose their own  training programs with their funding
allocation. The Department might  simply suggest a course list to
recipients. The Department may limit  the percentage of an
allocation to be spent on administrative  activities or specify a
percentage that must reach a local or regional level. Some
specification for sharing funds with neighboring jurisdictions
may be included, particularly where Memoranda of Understanding
(MOU) or mutual aid agreements exist between jurisdictions for
emergency response activities.
<p>
Some direction may be included governing the use of funds to 
purchase equipment. While the Act states that financial
assistance is for training, some have argued that training is
only valuable in conjunction with equipment that will be used.
The Department may develop a list of approved equipment for use,
develop a list of approved equipment for training, or restrict
equipment purchase to a percentage of discretionary funding.
Similar choices may be made regarding travel costs for training
of individuals and travel and salary costs for trainers.
<p>
Restrictions may be identified that address the timing of
funding use. For example, recipients may be required to use
allocated funds within each year, within some specified time, or
within the life of the program. An alternate option is to
annually reimburse approved expenses by each recipient.

<i>B. Discussion of Procedural Options</i>
<p>
The following section discusses the Department's current
research on procedural options for a Section 180(c) program and
the existing Federal programs that could be used as funding
mechanisms or to provide technical assistance. Also, the section
discusses ways to combine elements of existing options to create
new programs for funding and training. An analysis of each
procedural option is included in terms of the intent of the NWPA
and the stated goals of the Section 180(c) program. The options
can be considered either as avenues through which to administer
Section 180(c) or as models that the Department could emulate.
<p>
The existing Federal training programs are discussed in terms
of their safe routine transportation and emergency preparedness 
activities, and ways in which they are administered. Options
discussed include: (1) the Department of Transportation's
Hazardous Materials  Transportation Act grants, (2) the
Department of Transportation's Motor Carrier Safety Assistance
Program, (3) the Department of Transportation's Federal Railroad
Administration's State Participation Program, (4) current DOE
training programs, (5) the Federal Emergency  Management Agency's
Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement program, (6)  cooperative
agreements and grants, (7) Department-wide or OCRWM  assistance
programs, and (8) combinations of options from previous  groups.
<p>
1. <i>Department of Transportation, Research and Special
Programs</i> 
Administration, Interagency Hazardous Materials; Public Sector
Training and Planning Grants     
<p>
This program of Federal grants is primarily considered in this 
document for its applicability to emergency response training for
highway shipments.
<p>
DOT's Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) has
developed a program for reimbursable training and planning
grants (49 CFR Part 110). The program was established by the
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA), as amended by the
Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990.
It is intended to enhance existing State, tribal, and local
hazardous materials transportation emergency preparedness and
response programs by providing financial and technical
assistance, national direction, and guidance that enhances 
overall implementation of the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA). The program scope is broader
than that of Section 180(c), covering all hazardous materials,
not just radioactive materials. The program is supported by fees
collected from a registration program for shippers and carriers
of certain hazardous materials.
<p>  
RSPA has issued a list of activities eligible for funding
under this program. States and tribes must complete application
packages which require specific information on the intended use
of a proposed grant. Applications are reviewed semi-annually and
approved or declined by an RSPA grants administrator.
<p>    
Applications include detailed descriptions of proposed
programs of planning or training. For training grants, the
application includes a letter from the governor of the State or
from the tribal government with authorization for a particular
State agency or tribal organization to receive or administer the
grant; a statement explaining current practices for collecting
fees on the transportation of hazardous materials and whether
such fees are used to support hazardous materials 
transportation; a statement outlining individuals who will be 
responsible for coordinating and administering the program; a
detailed narrative of goals and objectives; a statement of work,
associated  costs, and schedule; and a description of major
costs.
<p>
For planning grants, the application includes a certification
for compliance with EPCRA; a statement of aggregate expenditures
for the previous two fiscal years; an agreement to make 75% of
the grant available to Local Emergency Preparedness Committees
(LEPC) or their designees; other specifics on who will
administer the grant and how;  and a statement that the State
Emergency Response Commission has reviewed the grants
application.
<p>
The recipient agency is required to provide 20% of direct and
indirect costs, acceptable in funds or in labor and equipment 
equivalents. Although limited needs-based advances are allowable
in some cases, in general the grants are reimbursed. An existing
grant is not a commitment of future Federal funding. Training
and/or planning grants have been awarded to 50 States, 5
territories, and 11 Indian  tribes. Indian tribes had been
restricted to only receiving planning  grants, but as of 1995
will also be eligible for training grants.
<p>
As directed within the HMTA, allocation criteria for both
training and planning grants are based on the needs of
applicants. A portion of the grants is set aside for separate
distribution to tribes. Allocation factors include objective
criteria and criteria based on performance, compliance, and
innovation. Some factors considered in allocating funds include:
number of hazardous materials facilities, types and amounts of 
hazardous materials transported, population at risk, frequency
and number of incidents reported in past years, high mileage
transportation corridors, whether fees are collected on
transportation of hazardous materials, and whether such fees are
used to carry out purposes related to this activity. This places
the burden on RSPA to identify the most needy applicants in the
application review process and reflect their assessment in each
award.
<p>
Assistance under Section 180(c) is not needs-based but
provided to each jurisdiction along NWPA transportation routes.
The Department will identify a program-specific basis for
Section 180(c) funding allocation.
<p>
<i>2. DOT, Federal Highway Administration, Office of Motor
Carriers, Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program</i>
<p>
The Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) is
primarily considered in this document for its applicability to
training for safe routine transportation procedures for highway
shipments. 
<p>
DOT provides Federal funds to the States for a variety of 
commercial motor vehicle activities that encourage each State to 
enforce uniform motor carrier safety and hazardous materials 
regulations through MCSAP. The program was established in the
Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 and reauthorized
in the Motor Carrier Act of 1991 (Title IV of the Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991). Present funding
levels exceed $80 million.
<p>
The objective of MCSAP is to reduce the number and severity
of accidents and hazardous materials incidents involving
commercial motor vehicle carriers by substantially increasing
the level and effectiveness of enforcement activity and the
likelihood that problems affecting, or potentially affecting,
safe vehicle operations will be detected and corrected. More
specifically, States use MCSAP funds to train personnel to
inspect vehicles and driver records, conduct reviews of carrier
operations, and promote public awareness of commercial vehicle
laws and safety. Also, States may use funds to support truck 
weight enforcement, drug interdiction activities, uniform truck
and bus accident reporting, Commercial Drivers License
enforcement, hazardous materials requirements training, research
and development, public education, and enforcement of State
traffic laws in conjunction with MCSAP roadside inspections.
<p>
Uniformity and compatibility of State regulatory requirements
affecting interstate and intrastate carriers is a primary goal
of the MCSAP. As a prerequisite for MCSAP funding, the Federal
Highway Administration requires that States adopt or agree to
adopt interstate and intrastate regulations which are compatible
with Federal safety regulations. Currently, 48 States and 4
Territories actively participate in MCSAP but not Indian tribes.
<p>
To receive basic MCSAP funding, a State must first agree to
adopt and assume responsibility for enforcing the Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Regulations (49 CFR parts 390-399) and highway
related portions of the Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations
(49 CFR parts 107, 171- 173, 177, 178 and 180) or compatible
State regulations. Each State must also submit annually a State
Enforcement Plan for the conduct of an effective safety program.
The Federal Highway Administration uses this plan as a basis for
monitoring and evaluating performance of the State.
<p>
The Federal Highway Administration, through regulations in 40
CFR  350, lists other specifics for basic grant approval and
identifies in more detail the contents of the State Enforcement
Plan including requirements of State participation in North
American Uniform Driver/ Vehicle Inspection standards and other
Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance programs. (The  Commercial
Vehicle Safety Alliance is a national organization that has 
developed uniform inspection procedures, and trains inspectors in
these procedures.)
<p>
Available MCSAP funds are distributed in three separate
grants:  Basic, Supplemental, and Special. Basic grants are given
to each State  with an approved State Enforcement Plan according
to an allocation formula based on the most recent reliable data
concerning the following factors in equal proportion: road
mileage, vehicle miles traveled, number of commercial vehicles
over 10,000 pounds, population, and special fuel consumption.
Supplemental grants are used to encourage innovative, successful,
cost efficient or cost effective programs and may include
emphasis areas identified through consultation between
the Federal Highway Administration and States. To be eligible
for a supplemental grant, a State must qualify for a basic
grant. Special grants are awarded for activities that help
States meet the requirements of eligibility for basic grants; or
for States already participating in the basic program, to
develop the prerequisites for expanded activities not presently
part of their basic programs. Special grants are also available
for research or data collection activities.  To be eligible for a
special grant, a State need not qualify for a basic grant.
<p>
MCSAP reimburses States for 80% of eligible costs identified
in the State's State Enforcement Plan. The other 20% must be
provided by the State. Eligible costs are defined in 49 CFR
350.29 but include salaries and benefits of inspection and
enforcement personnel, recruitment costs, training, equipment,
vehicles, uniforms, motor fuel and oil, communications
equipment, travel costs and per diem, and special inspection
equipment, among others. 
<p>
<i>3. DOT, Federal Railroad Administration, State Participation
Program</i>
<p>    
The Department has studied this program as a possible avenue to 
provide training for safe routine transportation procedures for
rail transportation.
<p>
Initial responsibility for the inspection of hazardous
material shipments by rail, which travel on private property,
historically has been placed with the railroads. Government
oversight of these type of inspections has been shared by both
the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Railroad
Administration. To date, States and tribes have played a limited
role in these inspections and no monetary Federal assistance is
currently provided in regard to the performance of the 
inspections. Following passage of HMTUSA, the Federal Railroad 
Administration promulgated regulations on State participation in 
railroad safety inspections and investigations concerning 
transportation of hazardous materials.

<p>
The State Participation Program (49 CFR Part 212) for
inspector training began in 1992. State participation is
voluntary. The Federal Railroad Administration pays for each
State participant's travel expenses, per diem allowance, and
course tuition associated with any conferences, seminars,
workshops or classroom training. The State is then required to
provide salary and benefits for the trained inspector who is
expected to spend fifty percent of his/her time conducting 
Federal Railroad Administration-related inspections. Federal
Railroad Administration training does not include provision of
gear or equipment.
<p>
The Federal Railroad Administration trains inspectors in five
disciplines: track, motive power and equipment, operating
practices, signal and train control, and hazardous materials. In
1995 there are 283 Federal Inspectors and 60 safety discipline
specialists spread across the eight standard Federal regions.
Currently, 30 States participate in the program with 134 State
inspectors encompassing all five safety disciplines.
<p>
The number of both Federal and State inspectors who receive 
training in any given fiscal year is dependent upon two factors.
These factors are the training budget allocated to the Federal
Railroad Administration as an agency and the reallocation of the
training funds within the Federal Railroad Administration which
determines the training offered and the number of inspectors,
both State and Federal, who will attend the training. If the
cost of training all the perspective Federal and State
inspectors in a single fiscal year would place a drain on the
training budget, then the participation in training is limited.
<p>
Prior to applying for the Federal Railroad Administration
inspector training program, a State employee must meet the
minimum apprentice level requirements as stated in 49 CFR Part
212. The Federal Railroad Administration will work with the
apprentice applicant to gain the necessary field experience in
order to become certified as a Federal Railroad Administration
inspector under the auspices of the State Participation Program.
<p>
<i>4. Current DOE Training Programs</i>
<p>
Current Department training programs are considered in this 
document as possible sources of training for all aspects required
of a  Section 180(c) program, regardless of chosen funding
mechanisms. 
<p>
The Department of Energy has an extensive infrastructure with
which  to train personnel for safe transportation of radioactive
materials,  compliance with Federal regulations, and preparedness
and response to radiological materials accidents at fixed
facilities and during shipment. The following discussion
describes the current divisions of responsibility within the
Department for transportation and emergency response policy,
current training programs for transportation-related activities,
and the applicability of these to a Section 180(c) program.  This
is not a comprehensive description of the Department's programs 
but rather an outline of those training programs with potential 
relevance to a Section 180(c) program.
<p>
The Department maintains a radiological accident response 
capability for the Federal government. The Department's Assistant
Secretary for Defense Programs manages the Radiological
Assistance Program and ensures that the necessary emergency
plans, procedures, and resources are developed and maintained.
Qualified Radiological Assistance Program teams are located in
ten regions of the United States ready to respond when summoned
by any other Federal agency, State, tribe, local government
official, private industry representative, or private citizen.
The Department's Office of Nonproliferation and National
Security is responsible for coordinating the development and
operation of the overall Departmental Emergency Management
System, including maintenance of an Emergency Operations Center.
The Department also provides this capability in support of the 
Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan, which outlines the
roles and responsibilities of all Federal agencies in situations
involving radioactive materials.
<p>
Within the Office of Environmental Management, the Office of 
Transportation, Emergency Management, and Analytical Services is 
responsible for setting Departmental policy on transportation
matters.  As part of this responsibility, the Office of Emergency
Management (EM- 26) Emergency Management Team administers the
Transportation Emergency  Preparedness Program, to coordinate all
non-weapons transportation emergency preparedness across the DOE
complex. The Transportation Emergency Preparedness  Program was
established in 1991 to coordinate the development and 
maintenance of uniform policies and approaches for Department
programs  and field offices responsible for transportation
emergency preparedness activities.
<p>
The Department is also involved in activities at national 
laboratories and regional operations offices around the country
that  require employees and contractors to be trained in proper
handling/ treatment of radioactive materials in routine and
emergency situations.  Transportation operations personnel must
be trained to meet the same Department of Transportation,
Environmental Protection Agency, and Nuclear Regulatory
Commission regulations required of all shippers of hazardous
materials. Because of the variety and magnitude of such 
activities, the Department has developed a number of training
courses that deal with radioactive materials. Many are offered
to State,  tribal, and local public safety officials as well as
Department and contractor personnel.
<p>
Section 180(c) program development could use existing
Departmental courses in several ways. Whether funding were
received through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, DOT,
the Department, or some combination, the training programs could
be modified to accept State and tribal members and train for
NWPA shipments. The courses may be required, approved, or simply
suggested by Section 180(c) policy.  Department training may
provide the added benefit of consistent, accurate training. The
Department offices that share responsibilities for the
Department's transportation and preparedness policies and 
infrastructure, Defense Programs, National Security and Non-
Proliferation, and Environmental Management Offices, will be
consulted  as the Section 180(c) program is developed. Any
training that is  provided under Section 180(c) will be most
effective when it enables  civil safety officials understand and
work better within the existing Departmental and Federal
systems.
<p>
<i>5. Federal Emergency Management Agency, Comprehensive
Cooperative Agreements</i>
<p>
The Department has studied this program as a possible avenue
to channel financial and technical assistance for all aspects of
the Section 180(c) mandate.
<p>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been charged with
building and supporting the nation's emergency management
system. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is responsible
for coordinating emergency planning, preparedness, mitigation,
and assistance functions for the Federal government. As part of
that mission, the Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement mechanism
channels financial and technical assistance to State, tribal and
local governments. The Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement
program (Public Law 95-224, Federal Grant and Cooperative
Agreement Act of 1977) is a possible mechanism through which
Section 180(c) assistance could be administered.
<p>
Each Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement program (the Federal
Emergency Management Agency currently administers about fifteen 
different Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement programs) can be
tailored to meet specific needs of the recipients and the
requirements of the authorizing legislation. Other agencies,
including the Department of Defense and the Environmental
Protection Agency, have used Comprehensive Cooperative
Agreements to deliver funding and technical assistance to meet
the needs of their programs and their statutory obligations.
<p>    
There is considerable flexibility in the Comprehensive
Cooperative Agreement and Cooperative Agreement programs that
would help cover several of the statutory mandates of Section
180(c). The money could be sent to a designated State or tribal
emergency response agency and then passed through to the agency
responsible for safe transport activities. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency already has the means to earmark funds as
Nuclear Waste Fund money, making it easier to monitor proper use
and effectiveness of the program. Lastly, the Comprehensive 
Cooperative Agreement program allows each statement of work to be

different to suit recipients' unique needs within the program's 
parameters.
<p>
Whether the Department uses the Comprehensive Cooperative
Agreement process as a funding mechanism, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's lead agency responsibility for coordinating
Federal emergency management makes it a candidate source for
technical assistance under Section 180(c). The Federal Emergency
Management Agency has lead agency responsibility for monitoring
hazardous materials planning and training under the Hazardous
Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of  1992, for the
Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee,  and
for the Radiological Assistance Committees.
<p>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency submitted a proposal
to the Department for administration of the Section 180(c)
program. Their proposal is referred to in the Summary of Public
Comments in this notice and will be considered along with other
comments received in response to the January 1995 notice.
<p>
<i>6. Cooperative Agreements and Grants</i>
<p>
Two basic mechanisms are used by Federal agencies to
distribute funds to State and tribal governments: cooperative
agreements and grants. The Federal Grant and Cooperative
Agreement Act (P.L. 95-224) outlines the proper use of each type
of mechanism. Grants primarily indicate a transfer of funds,
while cooperative agreements imply more substantial involvement
between parties. Grant mechanisms can be further subdivided into
categorical grants, block grants, and direct payments for a
specified use. A Section 180(c) program may make use of any of
these mechanisms.
<p>
Cooperative agreements reflect a more interactive
relationship between the Federal government and a State or local
government or other recipient. As with grants the principal
purpose of the cooperative agreement relationship is the
transfer of money, property, or services to the State or local
government or other recipient to accomplish a public purpose of
support authorized by Federal statute. But unlike grants,
substantial involvement is anticipated between the Federal 
agency and the State or local government or other recipient
during the planned activity.
<p>
Although grants usually present less of an administrative
burden than cooperative agreements, Section 180(c) policy may
require increased interaction between some recipients and the
Department.  Cooperative agreements generally require more
communication between the Department and the recipient
jurisdiction to develop scope of work, monitor activities, and
complete reporting requirements. Grants can be narrowly focused
in purpose and well defined so that once an application has been
approved the Department's role is limited with the recipient
jurisdiction having more flexibility and fewer record keeping 
and monitoring requirements.
<p>
The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management currently
has cooperative agreements with ten regional and national
organizations. A cooperative agreement mechanism could be
utilized to administer Section 180(c) funds to State and tribal
recipients. While it might add a layer of bureaucracy and
increase administrative costs, it may reduce the long range
costs to the Department. 
<p>
The Department could use a combination of grants and
cooperative agreements based on the recipient jurisdiction's
level of preparedness.  In general, cooperative agreements could
be established with recipients who lacked basic public safety
infrastructure, while a grant program could be established for
recipients with more developed infrastructures. This approach
could help address the lack of working infrastructure for safe
routine transportation and emergency response in some
jurisdictions and the fact that many existing Federal programs 
do not currently fund tribes as they do States.
<p>
The combination of cooperative agreements and grants would
allow for increased involvement between the Department and the
recipient jurisdiction when necessary while not requiring it of
all participants.  Once a basic level of preparedness had been
reached, a jurisdiction could transfer to the grant program.
With this option the Department could define a basic level of
preparedness and identify applicants accordingly, or allow each
applicant to determine the type of funding mechanism most
appropriate to them.
<p>
<i>7. Department-Wide Assistance Program or OCRWM Assistance
Program</i>
<p>
The options discussed above can be considered either as
avenues through which to administer Section 180(c) or as models
that the Department could emulate. If none of the options are
seen as sufficient to meet the statutory requirements of Section
180(c), it is possible that the Department could develop an
assistance program to consolidate all activities of similar
nature. In a more directed approach, OCRWM could create its own
assistance program tailored for Section 180(c).
<p>
Under a Department-wide program, OCRWM would participate with
other Departmental offices in establishing a program to
coordinate provision of financial and technical assistance
across all Department of Energy programs. The assistance could
be designed to address training needs for both emergency
response and safe routine transportation of radioactive
materials for States and Indian tribes for the whole range of
DOE nuclear shipments. These shipments include NWPA shipments, 
transuranic waste shipments to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, 
defense, and other Departmental shipments.
<p>
This approach presents a comprehensive program covering both
safe routine transportation and emergency response for both
States and tribes. It would promote coordination, increase
efficiency, consistency and uniformity throughout the
Department; and allow for a high degree of Departmental control
and oversight. One potential difficulty with this approach would
be that different Departmental offices responsible for shipping
work under different legal requirements that may not be 
compatible. A Departmental assistance program would also require
a commitment of resources to consolidate the functional programs
that have traditionally operated relatively independently. A
Departmental program may also adversely impact the current
schedule for developing the Section 180(c) program.
<p>
OCRWM could develop and implement its own program,
specifically tailored to Section 180(c) requirements. The
benefits of this approach are that OCRWM could develop a program
focusing solely on NWPA requirements. This offers greater
flexibility in designing funding mechanisms and funding
formulas. The disadvantages include duplication of State and
tribal training within the Department and overlap efforts of
other Federal agencies.
<p>
<i>8. Combination of Elements from the Previous Groups</i>
<p>
In order to encompass safe routine transportation and
emergency response training, for rail transportation and highway
transportation, and for State and tribal recipients, a
combination of procedural options may be most effective. There
are many ways to combine the options to meet the Section 180(c)
requirements.
<p>
Some options discussed above have the potential to meet all
of a Section 180(c) program's mandates while others have the
potential to cover only a portion. If the Federal Railroad
Administration and the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program
are used to implement Section  180(c) safe routine transportation
training, then a further combination of options will be
necessary. Emergency response training procedures and tribal
government participation requirements would be met through other
avenues.
<p>
Current Department programs, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's Comprehensive Cooperative Agreements, a Department-wide
program, or an OCRWM-wide program offer the best choices for 
implementing a complete Section 180(c) program through a single
option, but even here combinations are possible. If funding and
technical assistance are distributed through the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, current Departmental training
programs could supply the necessary training courses.
<p>
Other combinations are certainly possible and may include
options not discussed in this paper, such as using funds to
obtain training from private sources and from carriers of
hazardous materials.
<p>
<a name="comments">
<b>IV. Summary of Public Comments</b>
<p> 
The Department received 36 comments in response to the
January 3, 1995, Notice of Inquiry. Comments were received from
several State agencies, an Indian tribal government, a tribal
organization, county governments, national transportation safety
organizations, national and regional state government
organizations, one Federal agency, a nuclear energy business
organization, a utility and two citizens. The commenters held
very diverse opinions; no single theme for implementing Section
180(c) was apparent.
<p>
The following section discusses general categories and
summarizes  major points of comments and the Department's
response, where appropriate. The Department will provide
more-detailed responses to these comments and any additional
comments resulting from this Notice of Inquiry; Supplemental
Information when the Notice of Proposed Policy and Procedures is
issued in early 1996.
<p>
<i>Major Issues</i>
<p>
A. Section 180(c) Policy
<p>
The commenters raised many topics related to defining final
Section 180(c) policy. Although the Department recognizes that
these topics are closely related and overlap each other, this
section divides those topics into the following subsections:
general themes for a Section 180(c) program, safe routine
transportation, emergency response procedures, technical
assistance and equipment, and funding eligibility, allocation
and restrictions.
<p>
<i>General Themes</i>
<p>
A number of commenters offered ideas about the philosophy and
general structure of the program. These ranged from developing a
needs-based type of program to one that offers assistance for an
additional incremental level of training in existing hazardous
materials transportation training.
<p>    
Several commenters requested a program that assesses the
current capabilities of jurisdictions, assesses the needed level
of readiness for NWPA shipments, and then provides Section
180(c) assistance to make up the difference. They suggested that
planning grants could fund jurisdictions to complete the
capabilities assessment. Then, implementation grants could be
provided to carry out the identified activities.
<p>
Another general theme urged the Department to take into
account the low level of risk presented by spent nuclear fuel
and high-level radioactive waste shipments and proportion the
assistance and training accordingly. They maintained that
current hazardous materials transportation training for safe
routine and emergency response procedures is sufficient to
handle any situation that may occur.  Creating a Section 180(c)
program that went beyond the current hazardous materials
transportation training would send a message that the NWPA
shipments are more hazardous than they really are.
<p>
Separate from the issue over the basis for distributing
assistance, several commenters recommended using the State
Emergency Planning Committees and the Local Emergency Planning
Committees as points of contact to decide who should receive
assistance and to determine the needed level of training.
<p>
Other frequently occurring comments urged the Department not
to ship or to limit the number of shipments until a Section
180(c) program is in place. This comment was often made in
conjunction with the comment that the Department has an
obligation to accept waste in 1998, and if Congress identifies a
storage facility, shipping may well begin in 1998 or shortly
thereafter. In addition, these commenters urged the Department
to accelerate Section 180(c) implementation and to ask for a 
Section 180(c) budget allocation in the 1996 budget request to 
Congress.
<p>
Several commenters encouraged the Department to quickly
announce potential routes. They argued that jurisdictions need
to know as soon as possible what routes will be used so that
they may begin planning immediately for shipments and be
prepared if shipping occurs prior to the year 2010 currently
targeted by the Department.
<p>
<i>Safe Routine Transportation</i>
<p>
Several definitions of safe routine transportation were
offered.  These often included activities commenters thought
should be included in training for safe routine transportation.
One commenter endorsed the Transportation External Coordination
Working Group definition while two commenters wrote more
expansive definitions to include combinations of: alternate
route analysis, inspection and enforcement training, en route 
contingency plans, transportation infrastructure improvements,
shipment notification and tracking, escorts, public information,
and development and distribution of training curricula and
course materials.
<p>
Not all comments referred to safe routine transportation
directly, but identified the need for escorts and a satellite
tracking system.  The Conference of Radiation Control Program
Directors questioned the need for escorts as an expensive option
considering the actual level of risk compared to other hazardous
material shipments. The National Conference of State
Legislatures called for the Department to examine the
possibility of response teams travelling with the shipments. The 
tracking system was encouraged as a way to build trust in the
safety of the shipments and work more closely with the corridor
jurisdictions.
<p>
<i>Emergency Response Procedures</i>
<p>
Several commenters offered either definitions of emergency
response procedures or offered activities that they thought
should be covered by training for emergency response procedures.
Frequently, the Department was asked to delineate the
responsibilities of each response level in case of a spent
nuclear fuel transportation incident or accident. Only then
would the best funding mechanism be identified.
<p>
It was frequently commented that emergency response training
for local public safety officials should be integrated into
existing hazardous materials training. A couple of comments
pointed out that current hazardous materials training was
sufficient for local responders because the response
requirements for radiological incidents fall within the
requirements for other hazardous materials shipments.
<p>
Contradictory comments were received concerning training for 
hospital personnel. One commenter argued that training for
hospital personnel was not necessary, while others comments
ranged from the need to provide simple awareness training to
specialized decontamination equipment and training.
<p>
<i>Eligibility Criteria</i>
<p>
Comments on eligibility criteria focused on which
jurisdictional level should be eligible to apply for funds. Some
argued that local governments should be eligible to receive
funds directly. They argued that this would reduce
administrative costs and give local governments more control
over the assistance. Several counties simply requested that they
be guaranteed an amount of funding and given some discretion in
using the assistance. Other commenters said only States and
tribal agencies are eligible to apply for assistance.
 <p>   
Some commenters made suggestions regarding how the timing of
NWPA shipments through a jurisdiction impacts eligibility. The
Western Interstate Energy Board defined an eligible state or
tribe as host and corridor states or tribes through which
shipments under the NWPA are planned within six years. Others
said training should begin one to three years prior to shipment.
<p>
The point was also raised that tribes near corridor
jurisdictions should be eligible for assistance, since their
lands and people would be at risk in case of a transportation
accident or incident. 
<p>
<i>Funding Allocation Formula</i>
<p>
Once eligibility criteria are determined, the total
assistance available will have to be allocated among the
eligible parties.  Commenters were fairly specific in their views
of how funds should be allocated. A frequent comment was that
funds should be allocated according to the shipment miles
through a jurisdiction. The Western Interstate Energy Board
commented that annual implementation grants should have 75% of
the funds allocated according to shipment miles and 25%
allocated to ensure minimum funding levels and program 
capabilities. They defined shipment miles as the product of the 
expected number of shipments multiplied by the distance of such 
shipments. The Nuclear Energy Institute countered that the number
of  shipment miles through a jurisdiction does not automatically
make a jurisdiction more impacted and therefore does not qualify
them for additional assistance. They requested that the
Department allocate funding to incrementally increase
preparedness above what exists, rather than build a new
radiological response capability.
<p>
The Southern States Energy Board suggested that funding
should be allocated to each eligible jurisdiction based on a
formula that includes both the number of routes miles in the
jurisdiction and the population at risk along the shipment
route(s), with consideration given to existing capabilities.
<p>
The HMTA Training and Planning Grants approach (discussed on
pages 8 and 9 of this notice) to allocating funds was also
suggested as a model.
<p>
<i>Allowable Use of Funds</i>
<p> 
The Notice asked stakeholders what types of activities should
be allowed once funding has been allocated. This discussion
often overlaps with the discussion of program scope and the  
definition of key terms. Several State agencies and organizations
said that States and tribes should be the ones to prioritize
needs and decide who needs training. They argued that recipients
need wide latitude in deciding how to spend funds because of the
varying levels of preparedness, divisions of responsibility, and
other differences among jurisdictions. Many commenters, however,
said that the final allocation of funding should guarantee a
specific portion of the funding for local governments to use as
they see best.
<p>
Another comment argued that the DOT Research and Special
Programs Administration grants program provides a good model for
allowable activities. These regulations require recipient
jurisdictions to describe existing programs and explain how the
requested funds supply necessary improvements to the existing
capabilities. They also provide for monitoring of the program's
effectiveness.
<p>
Another frequently mentioned point was that the Section
180(c) program should not require any matching funds from the
jurisdiction in order to receive assistance.
<p>
The final Section 180(c) program will indicate what, if any, 
restrictions there will be on the use of funds. Most likely, the
types of activities that the Department will consider in this
area include:  what, if any, equipment a jurisdiction could
purchase; what, if any, training courses would be mandated or
recommended; and what, if any, percentage of funds would have to
be distributed to local public safety officials as opposed to
State, tribal, and regional officials.
<p>
<i>Technical Assistance and Equipment</i> 
<p>
Several commenters discussed the definition of technical
assistance in addition to equipment issues. All the comments
that included definitions of technical assistance identified the
need for equipment in that definition. Therefore, these topics
are being discussed together in this section.
<p>
Some commenters suggested that the Department use the 
Transportation External Coordination Working Group definition of 
technical assistance cited in the text above. Another suggested
using the Department's 1992 Draft Options Paper definition, also
cited above. 
<p>
Other suggestions were more broad in their application,
encompassing such things as emergency response equipment,
inspection equipment, assistance in route planning, emergency
response plan development, course development and exercises,
tracking capability, equipment and training for hospital
personnel, 24-hour access to Federal radiological safety
personnel, carrier qualifications, and funding, among others.
<p>
The Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors
questioned the need for equipment, especially for local
responders. They argued that the low risk of these shipments
does not justify a response capability beyond what currently
exists. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, on the other
hand, offered their assistance to the Department in providing
technical assistance and equipment to responders through their
role as providers of emergency and disaster preparedness for
State, tribal, and local governments.
<p>
One of the broader views on equipment came from the Council
of State Governments-Midwestern Office. They believe the
Department should supply funding for equipment, its maintenance
and calibration, and that States should have funding to purchase
computer software and hardware to assist with monitoring and
response activities.
<p>
<i>Concerns of Rural and Tribal Governments</i>
<p>
Many comments reflected concerns of jurisdictions in rural
parts of the country and of tribal governments. Issues of
concern to tribal governments are often very separate because of
their sovereign nation status. However, in many instances,
concerns overlap with those of rural jurisdictions.

Comments received that dealt directly with tribal issues
reiterated the Department's responsibility to work with tribes
on a government-to-government basis and to fulfill the
Department's Trust responsibility towards tribal governments.
One comment encouraged the Department to begin direct
communications with tribal governments near reactor locations to
address their particular concerns. The Department was also 
encouraged to contact tribal governments who may not know they
could have NWPA shipments crossing their lands.
<p>
The Department was also encouraged to take extra steps to
address the lack of infrastructure and resources on many of the
tribal lands that will be crossed by NWPA shipments. This should
include providing resources to allow tribes to participate in
the OCRWM program and to begin early to build an emergency
response infrastructure for those tribes lacking basic
infrastructure. One comment urged expansion of the cooperative
agreement with the National Congress of American Indians to help
facilitate communication with tribal governments.
<p>
Other commenters made suggestions about how a Section 180(c) 
program could address the concerns specific to rural areas. Rural
jurisdictions often rely heavily on volunteer public safety
personnel with high turnover rates, they serve large areas with
few staff, have few resources for training, and little or no
ability to travel to obtain training. The commenters encouraged
the Department to offer training in the community where the
local responders reside and to guarantee that certain levels of
training and equipment would be supplied.
<p>
Both tribal governments and rural local and state governments
expressed concern about lack of infrastructure or basic funding
and personnel to build infrastructure. The transportation
emergency response workshops sponsored by the National Congress
of American Indians through their cooperative agreement with the
Department of Energy, are a way to address tribal concerns. This
preliminary type of awareness training may help provide some of
the basic knowledge and know-how commenters mentioned as
lacking.
<p>
How much training and assistance is available for any
eligible jurisdiction will depend on how Section 180(c) policy
is defined. What training goals are set for what level of public
safety official will give an indication of the assistance
available at various governmental levels. These types of
decisions will also determine whether the Department provides
funding for the State and tribe to distribute as they see fit,
whether certain portions of funding are required to be spent at
the local level, whether training is proscribed at one or two 
locations around the country, or whether the Department sends
materials to the local jurisdiction for their own self-study.
<p> 
The Department has made no decisions regarding Section 180(c)
policy or the associated definitions and activities discussed
above.  These comments and others received throughout the
development of the Policy and Procedures will be considered in
the Department's decisions.
<p>
B. Section 180(c) Procedures
<p>
Of the options for implementation outlined in the Preliminary
Draft Options paper and the January Notice of Inquiry, no
clear-cut choice was identified in the comments. Some commenters
suggested additional sources to consider for implementation
procedures, and a few suggested new combinations of existing
options. 
<p>
One theme found among comments on procedural options was the 
request to minimize the administrative burden on all parties.
Depending on the perspective of the commenter, this appeared as
requests to either enhance or avoid existing programs. The theme
also surfaced as requests to limit layers of bureaucracy and
administration through which funding must be passed.
<p>
(1) Use Established Federal Agency Programs Other Than the
Department's
<p> 
From the State perspective, the Texas Department of Public
Safety,  Division of Emergency Management commented that
receiving additional assistance through an existing and familiar
program would be the least administratively burdensome. The
Federal Emergency Management Agency Comprehensive Cooperative
Agreement program, and the Research and Special Programs
Administration program, under the Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Act were both mentioned as good options to avoid 
multiple Federal agency coordination requirements. New assistance
programs, some felt, would create new administrative burdens.    
<p>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency commented extensively
with descriptions of their current regulatory authority to
monitor and assess emergency plans and preparedness and a
proposal for how they could administer the Section 180(c)
program. This agency has current training programs and expertise
in the emergency management field.  Although a commenter
criticized the agency for placing emphasis on preparations for
nuclear attacks rather than transportation incidents,  the
Federal Emergency Agency stressed their all-hazards approach to 
preparedness that includes radioactive materials shipments within
the larger scope of emergency preparedness.
<p>    
The Nuclear Energy Institute commented that a separate
program for Section 180(c) in addition to the Research and
Special Programs Administration under the Hazardous Materials
Transportation Act program will force utilities to pay twice for
emergency preparedness. They suggested that working with RSPA
could address this issue.
<p> 
Both tribal and non-tribal commenters identified problems 
associated with existing Federal programs and a dissimilar
approach to tribal assistance. Many concluded that the
Department will need to address tribes in separate agreements.
Also, it was suggested that the Department explore more current
funding mechanisms used by tribes such as the Department of
Housing and Urban Development Community Development and Block
Grant Program.
<p>
Many county commenters expressed concern that any additional 
involvement of the Federal government would detract from the
amount of funding ultimately destined for training costs and
equipment. Others cited a diminished focus on NWPA shipments,
Nuclear Waste Fund issues, government downsizing, or added
administration as negative aspects of this option. The
Commercial Vehicle Safety Association also pointed out that it
may put expertise and training further away from the intended 
delivery point.
<p>
(2) Establish Agreements With State, Local, Tribal, and Other 
Organizations
<p>     
This option prompted a variety of interpretations. Some
identified the potential improvements in regional cooperation
and efficiency as the biggest benefit to establishing agreements
with organizations.  Agreements or Memoranda of Understanding
between recipients, agreements between the Department and
recipients, or agreements between the Department and regional or
national coordinating organizations were all discussed. Overall,
State and regional coordination was identified as a benefit.
   <p> 
This option, specifically through an additional agreement
with the National Congress of American Indians, was indicated as
a potential solution to the Department ensuring up front
consultation with tribal recipients. It was suggested that
expansion of cooperative agreements with tribes would be
beneficial, particularly in light of the differences between
tribes and other recipients governments.
<p>
Many commenters, however, after praising the benefits of 
cooperative agreements pointed out that their development is a
lengthy, involved process and may take too long to implement
effectively. Two specifically cited the Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant program, which has developed over six years and only
involves seven States substantively.
 <p>
Also, this option was named as an unnecessary administrative
layer that would take away from total funding to be spent on
training.
<p>
Some other organizations were suggested for total or partial 
implementation or training support. The Association of American 
Railroads' Technical Training Center in Pueblo, Colorado is well
suited to train emergency responders for rail incidents and is
currently in operation. The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance
has worked closely with the Department to develop enhanced
uniform inspection standards and train inspectors.
<p>
(3) Establish a Department-Wide Grant Program
<p>
Response to this option was mixed. Some called it
inappropriate or difficult, citing the Nuclear Waste Fund issues
of commingling funds or the inability to coordinate with the
diverse shipping campaigns of the Department in a timely manner.
Another commenter noted that the fewer points-of-contact between
the Department and stakeholders would be beneficial.
<p>
One comment praised the current training courses offered at
the Nevada Test Site and encouraged the Department to include
them in Section 180(c) training. Another commenter suggested a
review of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant project as an
effective implementation of similar goals. However, it was noted
that this project targeted a smaller and better identified
group, and modifications would be necessary.
<p>
(4) Establish an OCRWM Grant Program 
<p>
Many commenters saw this option as the most direct funding
option.  Some pointed to a minimized bureaucracy and
administration, increased flexibility, and a resultant reduction
in competition with other funding priorities as benefits of
distributing Section 180(c) assistance without involving other
programs. Also, the diversity of recipients and increased
Department control and accountability were mentioned as
benefits.
<p>
The Western Interstate Energy Board commented on this option 
favorably, provided that such a grant program incorporates
flexibility to allow States to coordinate the training and
funding. The Southern States Energy Board and the National
Conference of State Legislatures both identified this option as
favorable if additional national or regional coordination
efforts were also supported.
<p>
Many county commenters interpreted this option as similar to
the direct payments made to local governments through Yucca
Mountain oversight programs. They were generally in favor of
options that assist local governments as directly as possible.
<p>
(5) Use Elements From the Previous Four Groups
<p>
Two commenters agreed that a combination of OCRWM grants and
regional/national group cooperative agreements would be best.
This could provide the proper degree of direct contact between
the Department and recipient governments while also encouraging
national or regional planning, coordination, and uniformity.
<p>
It may be necessary to apply a combination of options to
encompass the wide array of objectives outlined in the NWPA.
This range was discussed above in part III.B.8, Combination of
Elements from the Previous Groups.
<p>
C. Applicability of Section 180(c) to Private Shipments 
<p>
Many States, counties, and regional groups urged that the
Section  180(c) program should apply to all commercial spent
nuclear fuel or defense high-level radioactive waste shipments
ultimately destined for a NWPA facility, whether or not those
shipments are transported to and stored on an interim basis at a
private facility. Commenters cited that any large-scale shipping
campaign of such materials will have virtually the same impact
on States and tribes as that envisioned in the NWPA.
<p>
The Department does not currently have the legal authority to
implement a program of financial and technical assistance for
shipments other than those outlined by the NWPA. However, the
many comments on this issue have been noted.
<p>
D. Policy Development Process
<p>
A few commenters questioned the Department's plans to issue a
Notice of Policy and Procedures rather than establish the
program in regulations. They voiced concern that implementation
of Section 180(c) through regulations is necessary to ensure
stability through changes of leadership within the Department
and that an interpretation of policy and procedures is ``less
robust.'' An expedited rulemaking process was suggested to
accommodate time constraints.
<p>
The Department's response to these comments is that
development of the Interpretation of Policy and Procedures has
followed and will continue to follow Notice and Comment
Procedures of the Federal Rulemaking process. At some future
date the option of converting Policy and Procedures to a
rulemaking may be acted upon. In development, however, it was
the Department's intent to remain flexible in order to work
through unforeseen problems without rulemaking requirements.

<b>V. Conclusion and Request for Submission</b>
<p> 
This paper has presented a discussion of options for Section
180(c) policy and procedures. The subjects discussed here should
not be viewed as the only potential options for the program.
Comments received on this Notice and continuing research on
these options may still identify aspects of the program not
discussed here that will be included in the Notice of Proposed
Policy and Procedures, which the Department intends to publish
in 1996. The purpose of this document has been to share with 
stakeholders the research to date and request additional comments
from interested parties.
<p>    
The Department solicits comments from the public on all
aspects of Section 180(c) implementation.
