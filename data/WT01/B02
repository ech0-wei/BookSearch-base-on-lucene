An Analysis of the U.N. Committee on the 
Rights of the Child's Concluding 
Observations on Thirteen Countries</center>

<p>
Introduction</b>
<p>
	The <i>U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child</i> is being pushed for ratification in the United States. Since Article VI, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution states that treaties are the supreme law of the land, the <i>U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child</i> would be binding on all American families. Home schoolers, concerned parents, and many pro-family organizations are opposing the <i>U.N. Convention</i> because it will severely undermine the rights of parents to control the education, upbringing, and religious training of their children.
<p>
	In accordance with Section 44 of the <i>U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child</i>, each country which ratifies the <i>Convention</i> must report to the U.N. "Committee of Ten" on measures they are taking to comply with the <i>Treaty</i>. This committee consists of ten representatives appointed by the U.N. who are responsible for monitoring compliance of all signatory countries. After reviewing these reports, the Committee of Ten informs each country of any violations of the <i>Convention</i> which exist in its current laws and lists recommendations for changing their laws to better implement the <i>Convention</i>.
<p>
	This report analyzes the U.N.'s response to thirteen countries which submitted reports to the Committee of Ten: Canada, Great Britain, Poland, Spain, France, Norway, Denmark, Romania, Belgium, Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Chile. The report documents the specific areas in which the U.N. critiques the laws of these signatory nations, making clear the potential challenges to American laws if the United States also ratifies this Treaty.
<p>
	The Committee is opposed to the corporal punishment of children across the board. Every report has some reference to corporal punishment, variously referred to as "spanking," "child abuse," and "lack of respect for the child's physical integrity." In some reports, the Committee uses language such as, "The Committee recommends that awareness-raising and educational measures be undertaken to prevent child abuse and the physical punishment of children" (e.g. Summary of France). In other reports, the Committee is more explicit: "The Committee recommends that the physical punishment of children in the home be prohibited" (e.g. Summary of the United Kingdom). More-developed nations are encouraged to adopt educational programs to "sensitize" the population to the principles of the <i>Convention</i> (e.g. Summary of Canada).
<p>
	Throughout the reports, the Committee appears to have a double standard approach, coming down harder on the more-developed nations than their "third world" counterparts. Less-developed countries are encouraged to develop "monitoring mechanisms" to oversee the implementation of the <i>Convention</i> (e.g. Summary of the Philippines). In some reports, the Committee is critical of a country's budget because they feel that it does not appropriate enough money to "social sectors" such as health care and education (e.g. Summary of Indonesia). The Committee's recommendations for more-developed countries are much more broad and detailed. The Committee would like to see these countries incorporate the principles and provisions of the <i>Convention</i> within the training programs of all professional groups that are involved with children. Lawyers, judges, social workers, and teachers are some of these groups mentioned directly (e.g. Summary of Belgium). 
<p>
	The Committee wants schools to change their curricula to incorporate the principles of the <i>Convention</i>. It is worth noting that there is no distinction made between government or private schools in regard to this recommendation (e.g. Norway). The Committee also recommends that teaching methods be changed in order to reflect the "spirit and philosophy of the <i>Convention</i>" (e.g. Summary of the United Kingdom). The Committee singles out Great Britain for allowing parents to remove their children from certain sex education classes, alleging that it violates the child's "right of expression." The Committee criticizes Britain for allowing parents to "exclude their children from school"-a thinly-veiled reference to home schooling.
<p>
	To summarize the Committee's comments from all the reports, the Committee wants:
<ol><li>Corporal punishment abolished in every institution-including the family;</li>
<li>Monitoring mechanisms specifically designed to oversee the implementation of the <i>Convention on the Rights of the Child</i>;</li>
<li>Curriculum changes in all schools to conform to the <i>Convention</i>;</li>
<li>Teaching methods that reflect the "spirit and philosophy of the <i>Convention</i>;"</li>
<li>"Sensitization" programs for all professional groups that deal with children;</li>
<li>"Sensitizing" of the population as a whole to the principles of the Convention;</li>
<li>Children to have freedom of expression and the right to make decisions affecting their education.</li></ol>
<p>
	The common "violations" the Committee commonly found in other nations could easily be found in the U.S. In order to satisfy the Committee's demands, many rights traditionally enjoyed by parents in the U.S. would have to be taken away. More than simply superfluous, the <i>Convention</i> is at odds with the very foundations of American family law, which is rooted in Constitutional, Common Law, and Biblical traditions. Moreover, a fundamental premise of a free society is that citizens have a right to live under laws passed by duly elected representatives, not unaccountable, supranational bureaucrats. The <i>U.N. Convention</i> and the Committee of Ten would be clear threats to the sovereignty and autonomy of the United States as a free republic.
<p>	
	A more detailed summary on the Committee's reports on each of the thirteen countries follows. Relevant excerpts from each country's report are attached in the appendix.
<p>
<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on Canada</b>
<p>	
	<i>The Committee Considered the</i> Canadian Report <i>on May 24-26, 1995</i>.
<p>
	Canada played an important role in drafting the <i>U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child</i> and also participated in the World Summit for Children in 1990 (<i>Consideration of Reports: Canada</i>, page 2). Although Canada is recognized by the Committee to have strengthened their protection of human rights, the Committee "is concerned that sufficient attention has not been paid to the establishment of a permanent monitoring mechanism that will enable an effective system of implementation of the <i>Convention</i> in all parts of the country" (page 2).
<p>
 	The Committee is concerned that Canada made reservations to Articles 21 and 37 of the <i>Convention</i>. Article 21 regulates all adoption services; Article 37 gives children the right to take their parents to court and also gives the State the power to take a child from his family (Section 10). The Canadian government took exception to these articles, attempting to alter them as far as application.
<p>
	Section 14 of the <i>Committee Report</i> states, "Further measures seem to be needed to effectively prevent and combat all forms of corporal punishment and ill-treatment of children in schools or in institutions where children may be placed." The Committee goes on to recommend in Section 25, that "the physical punishment of children in families be prohibited." 
<p>
	In order to stop "violence" in families, the Committee suggests that "the State party consider the possibility of introducing new legislation and follow-up mechanisms" be "launched with a view of changing attitudes in society on the use of physical punishment in the family and fostering the acceptance of its legal prohibition" (Section  25).
<p>
	In Section 19 of the report, the Committee wants a nation-wide education campaign to be launched for the purpose of "sensitizing" the population to the principles and provisions of the <i>Convention</i>. The Committee suggests that the <i>Convention</i> be incorporated in school curricula and in the training curricula of professional groups that deal with children, such as judges, lawyers, immigration officers, peace keepers, and teachers.
<p>
	 The Committee also recommends that "emphasis be placed on federal monitoring mechanisms" in order to establish a "comprehensive network for the collection of data covering all areas of the <i>Convention</i> and taking into account all groups of children within Canadian jurisdiction...."

<p>
<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on the United Kingdom</b>
<p>
	<i>The Committee considered the</i> United Kingdom Report <i>on January 24-25, 1995</i>. 
<p>
	The U.N. Committee expressed concern that the United Kingdom does not have a specific "mechanism" designed to oversee the implementation of the <i>Convention  (Concluding Observation: United Kingdom,</i> Section  8). The Committee also believes that "insufficient expenditure is allocated to the social sector both within the State party and within the context of international development aid" (Section  9).
<p>
	The United Kingdom is criticized by the Committee because the "health status" of the children of ethnic minorities and socio-economic groups is apparently not the same as those of other ethnic groups of citizens (Section  13).
<p>
	The Committee is "concerned" that children are denied their freedom of expression because their parents have the right to prohibit them from attending sex education classes in school. The Committee went on to say that "In this, as in other decisions, including exclusion from school, the child is not systematically invited to express his/her opinion and those opinions may not be given due weight, as required under article 12 of the Convention" (Section  14). This section is particularly dangerous for home schoolers. The phrase "exclusion from school" could be used against home schoolers if their "schools" are not recognized by the Committee.
<p>
	The Committee is "disturbed" with Great Britain's laws that allow for reasonable chastisement within the home. The Committee is worried that many parents will interpret what is "reasonable" in an arbitrary fashion. Thus, this legislation is deemed incompatible with the provisions and principles of the <i>Convention</i> (Section  16). The Committee also expresses concern that private schools are still permitted to administer corporal punishment. Legislation to prohibit this practice is wanted by the Committee (Section 26).
<p>
	The Committee would like to see the <i>U.N. Convention</i> included in the training curriculum of professionals who work with children (Section  26). It also recommends that teachers modify their teaching methods to conform with the "spirit and philosophy of the <i>Convention</i>, and that the <i>Convention</i> be incorporated within the school curriculum" (Section  32).
<p>
	The Committee recommends that measures be taken to train parents in their responsibilities towards the rights of their children (Section  30) and that the physical punishment of children in the home be prohibited in light of the articles in the Convention which protect the child's "physical integrity" (Section  31).
<p>

<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on France</b>
<p>	
	<i>The Committee considered the</i> French Report <i>on April 11-12, 1994</i>.
<p>
	The Committee is basically pleased with the actions of the French government in complying with the <i>U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child</i>. However, there are a few "concerns" that the Committee addresses. The Committee would like France to consider more ways in which children can actively participate in the decision-making processes affecting their lives, "in particular within school and the local community." (<i>Consideration of Reports: France</i>, Section  23). 
<p>
	The Committee suggests that "awareness-raising and educational measures be undertaken to prevent child abuse and the physical punishment of children" (Section  24).
<p>

<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on Norway</b>
<p>
	<i>The Committee Considered the</i> Norway Report <i>on April 18-19, 1994</i>.
<p>
	The country of Norway has been cooperative in implementing the general principles of the <i>U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child</i> and in complying with the requirements of Article 44 (by filing requested reports and submitting requested materials). Norway was the first country in the world to establish an "ombudsman" to work with the government, municipalities, and non-governmental agencies to protect the human and civil rights of the children in Norway. The <i>Convention</i> is also pleased with the efforts being made to end discrimination and "xenophobia." (<i>Consideration of Reports: Norway,</i> Section  B)
<p>
	The Committee is concerned that insufficient attention has been paid to implementing Articles 2 and 37 of the <i>Convention</i>. Article 2 bans all forms of discrimination against children and protects them against "punishment on the basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs" (Section  2). Article 37 states, "every child that is deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults" (Section C).
<p>
	The Committee also requests that Norway implement training programs for government officials, teachers, social workers, etc. on the principles and provisions of the <i>U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child (Consideration of Reports: Norway,</i> Section (D) 19).
<p>
	The Committee wants Norway to improve its education system by incorporating the <i>Convention</i> into the curricula for school children. They also request that religious education policy be changed so it does not discriminate against the child or violate his right to privacy (Section (D) 23).
<p>
	The Committee insinuates that the reason for Norway's high suicide rate among young people is because the <i>Convention</i> is not being enforced to its fullest (Section (D) 17).
<p>

<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on Belgium</b>
<p>
	<i>The Committee considered the</i> Belgium Report <i>on May 31-June 1, 1995</i>. 
<p>
	The Committee wants Belgium to reform its current legislation with the view of "ensuring the prohibition of corporal punishment within the family" (<i>Consideration of Reports: Belgium</i>, Section  15). The Committee would also like to see views of children given due weight in the "decision making processes affecting their lives, in particular in family life" (Section  16). 
<p>
	Regarding education, the Committee would like the <i>Convention</i> to be incorporated within school curricula (Section  17). The Committee encourages teachers to use teaching methods that "reflect the spirit and philosophy of the <i>Convention</i>" (Section 17) Professional groups (teachers, social and health workers, law enforcement officials, etc.) are asked to incorporate the provisions and principles of the <i>Convention</i> into their training programs (Section  18). 
<p>	
	The Committee wants Belgium to form a permanent, national mechanism for the purpose of coordinating the implementation of the <i>Convention</i> established by Belgium (Section  8).

<p>
<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on Denmark</b>
<p>	
	<i>The Committee considered the</i> Denmark Report <i>on January 18-19, 1995</i>. 
<p>	
The U.N. Committee expressed concern that Articles 3, 12, 13, and 15 "have not been adequately reflected in national legislation and policy making." (<i>Consideration of Reports: Denmark</i>). Article 3 of the <i>Convention</i> gives the State the authority to insure that families and other institutions responsible for the care of children comply with the regulations of the "competent authorities." Articles 12 and 13 give the child the right to the freedom of expression and the right to secure any information or ideas "regardless of frontiers." Article 15 gives children the freedom of assembly and protest.
<p>
	The Committee believes that "[m]onitoring mechanisms are essential...to ensure parity in all localities as regards the provision of services to children." The Committee would also like to see "the development and use of social and other indicators to monitor the implementation of all the rights provided for in the <i>Convention</i>" (Section 21).
<p>
	The Committee believes that "education about the principles and provisions of the <i>Convention</i> be systematically incorporated into retraining programmes (sic) and training curricula for various professional groups working with and for children such as teachers, social workers, law enforcement personnel and judges" (Section 23). The Committee believes that the <i>Convention</i> should be incorporated within schools and that all teaching methods should reflect the "spirit and philosophy of the <i>Convention</i>" (Section 29).
<p>
	It is recommended by the Committee that "further consideration be given to establishing mechanisms to ensure that children may express their views and have them taken into account in decision-making processes affecting them, including at school and within the community" (Section 26).
<p>
	Further measures are suggested by the Committee to "put an end to violence against children, including in the home" (Section 28).
<p>

<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on Spain</b>
<p>	
	<i>The Committee considered the</i> Spain Report <i>on October 6-7, 1994</i>. 
<p>
	The Committee expresses "concern" that Article 154 of the Spanish Civil Code provides that parents "may administer punishment to their children reasonably and in moderation." The Committee fears that this could be interpreted to include the practice of corporal punishment (<i>Consideration of Reports: Spain</i>, Section  10). The Committee wants Spain to "revise" this law to conform with the <i>Convention</i>.
<p>
	The Committee would like to see Spain develop more comprehensive "monitoring" systems at "all levels of the administration, central, regional, and local" to ensure that the <i>Convention</i> is "fully respected," and implemented (Section  12).
<p>
	Spain is encouraged to take measures to train law enforcement officials, judges, or any professional group that deals with children on the principles of the <i>Convention</i> (Section  16).
<p>
	The Committee wants Spain to do more to "strengthen the system of assistance to both parents in the performance of their child-rearing responsibilities" (Section  21).

<p>
<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on Poland</b>
<p>
	<i>The Committee considered the</i> Poland Report <i>on January 16-17, 1995</i>. 
<p>
	The Committee is concerned by inadequate training on the principles and provisions of the <i>Convention</i> by professional groups (<i>Consideration of Reports: Poland</i>, Section 17). The Committee wants training programs to be organized and teachers, law enforcement officials, and judges, etc. to be periodically trained in the area of children's rights (Section 28).
<p>
	In regards to corporal punishment, the Committee regrets that "appropriate measures have not yet been taken to effectively prevent and combat corporal punishment and ill-treatment of children in schools or in institutions where children may be placed. The Committee is also preoccupied by the existence on a large scale of child abuse and violence within the family and the insufficient protection afforded by the existing legislation in that regard" (Section 18). The Committee wants national legislation made to prohibit "corporal punishment in the family" (Section  30). Further steps are recommended by the Committee to "strengthen the system of assistance to both parents in the performance of their child-rearing responsibilities" (Section  33).
<p>

<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on Romania</b>
<p>	
	<i>The Committee considered the</i> Romanian Report <i>on January 20-21, 1995</i>. 
<p>
	The Committee expresses its concern that adequate training of social workers, law enforcement officials, and judicial personnel on the principles and provisions of the <i>Convention</i> is not being practiced effectively (<i>Consideration of Reports: Romania</i>, Section  11). The Committee wants special training for social workers on this subject (Section  17). 
<p>
	The Committee recommends that "Special efforts should be made to bring the existing legislation fully in line with the provisions of the <i>Convention</i>" (Section  14). In order to do this, the Committee wants the Romanian Family Code of 1954 be revised to comply with the Convention (Section  14). The Committee would also like to see research conducted on issues of "child abuse and neglect within the family" (Section  16).
<p>

<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on Pakistan</b>
<p>
	<i>The Committee considered the</i> Pakistan Report <i>on April 4-5, 1994</i>.
<p>
	Pakistan was one of the first countries to ratify the <i>Convention on the Rights of the Child</i>. Pakistan was also one of the six initiators of the World Summit for Children in 1990 (<i>Consideration of Reports: Pakistan,</i> page 1). The CRC Committee feels that the current legislation in Pakistan is "not sufficient to ensure the implementation of the <i>Convention</i>" (page 1). 
<p>
	The Committee expresses its concern that sufficient attention has not been given to implementing Articles 2, 3, 6, 12, 37, 39, and 40 of the <i>Convention</i>. Article 2 bans all forms of discrimination against children and protects them against "punishment on the basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs" (Section  2). Article 12 gives the child total freedom of expression. Article 37 states, "every child that is deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults..." (Section  c).
<p>
	The Committee recommends that Pakistan expand its health care system to further emphasize  "family education, including family planning..." (Section 29). 
<p>
	The Committee wants Pakistan to improve its education system in order to reduce the number of children working (Section 30). In other words, the Committee wants compulsory school attendance for Pakistani children. 

<p>
<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on the Philippines</b>
<p>
	<i>The Committee considered the</i> Philippine Report <i>on January 10-11, 1995</i>. 
<p>
	The Committee is concerned about the lack of "efficient mechanisms" to monitor the situation of children in the Philippines (<i>Consideration of Reports: Philippines</i>, Section 9). The Committee is aware that not all children born in the Philippines are registered after birth (Section  11). The Committee recommends that "monitoring mechanisms" be strengthened in order that "full enjoyment" of children's rights be promulgated (Section 20).
<p>
	The Committee is "seriously alarmed" at the existence of "child abuse" and neglect within the family (Section  13). Greater efforts are wanted by the Committee to provide "family life education" to develop awareness of the responsibility of the parents (Section  22).
<p>
	Children's rights-oriented programs are suggested by the Committee to be used to train professional groups such as teachers, judges, social workers, etc. in order to "emphasize the promotion and protection of the fundamental rights of the child" (Section  22).
<p>

<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on Indonesia</b>
<p>
	<i>The Committee considered the</i> Indonesian Report <i>January 22-23, 1995</i>. 
<p>	
	The Committee is concerned that "insufficient attention is given to the implementation of the general principles of the <i>Convention (Consideration of Reports: Indonesia</i>, Section  13). The Committee states that implementing the principles of the <i>Convention</i> "is not to be made dependent on budgetary resources" (Section 13). The Committee is disappointed that a very small portion of the Indonesian budget is reserved for social programs, "particularly primary health care and primary education" (Section  14).
<p>

<b>A Summary of the U.N. Report on Chile</b>
<p>
	<i>The Committee considered the</i> Chile Report <i>on April 14-15, 1994</i>.
<p>
	Chile has worked hard to implement the <i>U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child</i>. Chile has worked with government officials, non-governmental coalitions, and other internationally interested parties (<i>Consideration Reports: Chile,</i> Sections (a) and (b)). They have established a national monitoring service for minors (SENAME) to help protect the rights granted under the <i>Convention</i> (Section  7). Chile is also considering ratifying the <i>Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption</i> (Section  9).
<p>
	The Committee is concerned that poverty among many of the people will have a constraining influence on the implementation of the <i>Convention</i> in Chile (Section  10). The Committee warns that the decentralization of government may lead to a decline in the quality of education and health services to "vulnerable groups of children" (Section  12). The Committee is also concerned that the geographical and social disparities may hinder some from enjoying the benefits granted by the <i>Convention</i> (Section  13).
<p>
	The Committee wants arrangements to be made to widely publicize the provisions of the <i>Convention</i> to the general public, especially to those who are responsible to maintain the implementation and application of the <i>Convention</i>, such as teachers, social workers, law enforcement officials, judges, etc. (Section  18).

	Although parental rights and family freedoms are firmly established as "fundamental and beyond the reach of any court," lower courts and agencies have not prevented wholesale invasions of homes and families. Parental rights are under attack, and families across the nation are being harmed by a legal system that refuses to protect their fundamental rights.
<p>
	Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) and Congressman Steve Largent (R-OK) have introduced legislation which will dramatically improve the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995 is sponsored by these and numerous other original co-sponsors. At the request of Senator Grassley, attorney Michael P. Farris of the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) has served as the chief draftsman of this legislation. Other major pro-family leaders and organizations have joined with HSLDA in promoting The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act including Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women of America, Gary Bauer of Family Research Council, Dr. James Dobson of Focus on the Family, Phyllis Schlafly of Eagle Forum, and Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition. 
<p>
	The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (PRRA) does not manufacture a single new federal program or create a need for new bureaucrats at any level of government. Rather, it simply establishes the legal standard to be employed in judging cases where the right of parents comes in conflict with the decisions or policies of government officials.
<p>
	The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act re-affirms the bonds of families by allowing parents to direct the upbringing of their children and make choices for their families while establishing the legal standard to determine when the government can interfere in the family.
<p>
	The PRRA clearly establishes the fundamental right to raise one's child. However, just as the rights to free speech or religious freedom set forth in the Bill of Rights have their limits, the PRRA does not allow parents to abuse their children, keep them uneducated, or deny life-saving medical treatment. The PRRA re-affirms the right of parents to make the decisions that are within the law, without the government looking over their shoulder.
<p>
<b>Why Do We Need a Parental Rights Act Now?</b>
<p>
	The reason The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act is necessary is because the rights of parents have been slowly eroded away by numerous lower court decisions. The gradual erosion of parental freedom must be stopped now before it is too late. Below are numerous examples of how the rights of parents to educate, raise, discipline, and control their own children are being usurped in various court decisions. 
<p>
	It is important to note that the Supreme Court employs two basic levels of protection in its analysis of constitutional rights. The higher level of protection is employed in cases involving "fundamental rights." Significantly lower levels of protections are provided to rights the Supreme Court has labeled "nonfundamental."
<p>
	For example, home school parents were thrilled by the excellent decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan in 1993, handled by the Home School Legal Defense Association, which declared that teacher's certification was unconstitutional as applied to religiously motivated home schooling parents (<i>People v. DeJonge</i>, 501 N.W. 2d 127, 1993). However, in a companion case decided the same day, the Michigan Supreme Court held that secular home schooling parents suffered no constitutional violation when forced to comply with the certification requirement (<i>People v. Bennett</i>, 501 N.W. 2d 88, 1993). The difference between these two decisions was simple, but profound. The Michigan court held that religious freedom was a fundamental right whereas "parents' rights" were "nonfundamental" in nature.
<p>
	Although there are a number of Supreme Court cases which make it clear that the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children is a fundamental right, lower courts have a very spotty record. Some of the higher courts plainly recognize that the constitution protects parental rights and family freedoms.

<blockquote>This primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition. United States Supreme Court, <i>Wisconsin v. Yoder</i>, 406 U.S. 205 (1972).
<p>
The family is the principal conservator and transmitter of cherished values and traditions. Any invasion of the sanctity of the family, even with the loftiest motives, unavoidably threatens those traditions and values. Supreme Court of Utah, <i>In re J.P.</i>, 648 P.2d 1364 (Utah 1982).
<p>
The right of a parent, under natural law, to establish a home and bring up children is a fundamental one and beyond the reach of any court. Court of Appeals of New York, <i>Portnoy v. Strasser</i>, 104 N.E.2d 895 (N.Y. 1952).</blockquote>

	There are two constitutional texts which the Supreme Court has recognized as the source of parental rights protection. The provision of the Fourteenth Amendment which protects "life, liberty, and property" was the basis of the 1925 decision of <i>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</i>, which held that parental liberties were violated by an Oregon law which banned private schools. The Ninth Amendment declares that the failure to enumerate specific rights of the people does not mean that the rights are lost. This constitutional presumption in favor of the traditional rights of citizens was recognized and in place at the time of the adoption of the <i>Bill of Rights</i>. Parental rights have long been recognized as "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty."
<p>
	However, these constitutional protections are being ignored or misapplied by lower courts and agencies, resulting in the violation of parental rights and family freedoms. 
<p>
<b>Court Decisions Which Usurp Parental Rights</b>
<p>	
For example, the Supreme Court of Washington ruled that it was not a violation of parents' rights to remove a child from her family because she objected to their reasonable rules which were reasonably enforced. The parents had grounded their eighth-grade daughter because she wanted to smoke marijuana and sleep with her boyfriend. She objected, and the court removed her from the home. [In re Sumey, 94 Wash.2d 757, 621 P.2d 108 (1980)]
<p>
	A social worker testified under oath that if she received anonymous complaints against the Governor of Alabama, she would need to inspect his home, no matter what evidence was offered to rebut the allegations. [Transcript from trial court in <i>H.R. v. Alabama Dept. of Human Resources</i>, 609 So. 2d 477 (Ct. Civ. App. Ala. 1992)]
<p>
	Families challenged Illinois' practice of nude inspections of children, warrantless searches of homes, and failure to implement a probable cause standard for investigations of abuse. This suit was rejected, because the court held that the parents had consented to these practices by permitting the child abuse investigations. [<i>E.Z. v. Coler</i>, 603 F.Supp. 1546 (N.D.Ill. 1985), <i>aff'd sub nom. Darryl H.</i> v. Coler, 801 F.2d 893 (7th Cir. 1986)]
<p>
	When Maryland required every elementary school to provide comprehensive sex education for all students, parents went to federal court demanding an "opt-out" provision. The judge dismissed all their claims outright. [<i>Cornwell v. State Board of Education</i>, 314 F.Supp. 340 (D.Md. 1969), <i>aff'd</i>. 428 F.2d 471 (4th Cir. 1970), <i>cert. den.</i> 400 U.S. 942 (1970)]
<p>
	Parents in Chelmsford, Massachusetts were never told that their children would be required to sit through a ninety-minute presentation by "Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions, Inc." In this so-called "group sexual experience" a male child was told to lick a condom, after which a female student was told to pull the condom over his entire head and blow it up. [<i>Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions, Inc.</i>, CN 93-CV-11842K (D.Mass. filed Dec. 1993)]
<p>
	After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could require parental consent before a minor's abortion, California enacted exactly what the Court had permitted. Abortion activists filed suit against the law in a San Francisco courthouse, which ruled that under the California Constitution, a child's privacy right outweighed any rights of parents. [<i>American Academy of Pediatrics v. Van de Kamp</i>, 214 Cal.App.3d 831 (San Franciso Sup. Ct., 1989), <i>aff'd sub nom. American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren</i>, 26 Cal.App.4th 479 (Ct.App. 1994)]
<p>	
Kevin, aged 15, had "elephant man disease," which caused a large fold of skin to grow over the right side of his face. Kevin's mother wanted to wait until Kevin turned 21 before permitting any surgery. The doctors testified that the surgery was very risky, and offered no cure, and that waiting would decrease, not increase the risk. Even so, the judge overruled the mother's objections, declared Kevin a "neglected child," and ordered the series of operations. [<i>In re Sampson</i>, 65 Misc.2d 658, 317 N.Y.S.2d 641 (Fam.Ct. 1970), <i>aff'd</i>. 377 App.Div.2d 668, 323 N.Y.S.2d 253 (1971), <i>aff'd</i>. 29 N.Y.S.2d 900, 278 N.E.2d 918, 328 N.Y.S.2d 686 (1972)]
<p>
	A San Diego grand jury found that in child abuse cases in that county alone, family freedoms were violated in over three hundred cases. They found that 35 to 70 percent of the children who were taken from their families in San Diego County "should never have been removed from their parental homes." [<i>See</i>, "Sex, Lies, and County Government: Abuse Case Shows It All," <i>The San Diego Union Tribune</i>, July 19, 1992, 4C]
<p>
	One of the most major threats against parental freedom in America is coming form withou in the form of a treaty. President Clinton has ordered the U.S. to sign the <i>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</i>. The U.N. Committee on Children, which officially interprets the meaning of this treaty, has ruled that it requires Britain to outlaw corporal punishment, conduct public educational campaigns to cause society to accept the prohibition of corporal punishment, limit the rights of parents to withdraw their children from sex education classes, and change laws to increase the ability of children to participate in their parents' decisions concerning them. [<i>Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child: United Kingdom</i>, CRC/C/15/Add.34 (Jan. 1995)] The dangers of this treaty, which has yet to be ratified by two-thirds of the U.S. Senate, are far reaching.
<p>
	What do American children and families need to be secure in their homes? We already have constitutional rights-we need legal remedies! We need an Act of Congress that lets states protect children, but makes sure they don't destroy families in the process. We need <b>The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act.</b>
<p>
<b>How Will The Parental Rights
and Responsibilities Act Protect Families?</b>
<p>	
As can be seen above, traditional values and concepts are under constant attack. Social workers constantly tell parents that it is illegal to spank children. They're wrong, but such social workers can make the lives of innocent parents miserable in the process. School officials routinely invade the sanctity of the family with highly personal surveys and therapeutic programs based on relativistic values and anti-parent philosophies. Children are often told, "Nothing we say in this program should ever be shared outside this room."
<p>
	Lawyers and bureaucrats who cite tragic cases of abuse as grounds for opposing The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act ignore the fact that a child's most important right is to have an actively involved, loving parent to protect that child's interest. Besides The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act will actively fight child abuse by facilitating swift and just punishment for parents who abuse their children.
<p>
	Essentially, The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act draws a line in the sand. It declares that the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children is a fundamental right. The PRRA contains several answers to the hottest issues facing parents:
<ul><li>When government officials claim that modest, reasonable spanking is illegal, parents can point to the PRRA to demonstrate that they have the right to lovingly administer reasonable physical discipline to their children.</li>
 <li>When social workers claim superior rights to make routine (nonlife-threatening) medical decisions for children, parents can point to the PRRA as support for the right of parents to choose among the available options.</li>
 <li>When school officials claim the right to trump the choices of parents in education, the PRRA provides the legal framework for parents to fight back.</li></ul>
<p>
	The PRRA does not mean that parents will win all cases, nor does it dictate the outcome in specific fact patterns. Rather, it enacts a specific legal standard which guarantees that courts will give parental rights the highest level of judicial deference. 
<p>
	The PRRA gives a statutory, civil rights language protection which is absolutely consistent with the traditional understanding of the Constitution. 
<p>
	The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act makes explicit the fact that families and parents are irreplaceable. It sends a message the public officials that parental rights must be honored and a message to parents that parental responsibilities must be fulfilled. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act recognizes the fundamental authority of the family over the government. It's a simple way to limit government and, at the same time, strengthen the family.
<p>
<b>Why Should Congress Deal With
Parental Rights in the First Place?</b>
<p>	
The proper answer to that question must come from the text of the Constitution itself. Many believe that Congress has become drunk with power in the last forty years and the last thing Americans want is Congressional intervention in an area for which Congress has no constitutional authority. Simply put, Congress should stop doing things for which there is no constitutional mandate, and should do a good job at those few issues which are clearly enumerated in the Constitution.
<p>
	There is no grant of authority to Congress to legislate the details of family life. However, the 14th Amendment grants Congress explicit authority to pass legislation which serves to protect the constitutional rights of citizens. The problem with Congress is that oftentimes, its idea of protecting a right is to create yet another government program and subsidy. Such programs are normally a violation of the letter and spirit of the Constitution.
<p>
	However, for over 70 years the Fourteenth Amendment has been properly interpreted to serve as a national bulwark protecting citizens when state governments intervene in the sphere of authority reserved to parents. Again, when Oregon attempted to force all children to attend public schools in the 1920's, the Supreme Court correctly applied the Fourteenth Amendment to override the state's decision which invaded the parental authority.
<p>
	Under traditional constitutional doctrine, as well as the express language of the Fourteenth Amendment (Section 5), Congress has the responsibility and authority to protect the rights of citizens within these express areas. All early presidents and many founding fathers in Congress believed that all three branches of the federal government-not just the Supreme Court-have the authority to interpret the constitution. With that authority comes the responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of American citizens.
<p>
	To put it in simple words, Congress has no authority to regulate family life, but has express authority to protect the liberty of parents. Congress should be in the business of protecting liberty, not regulating our lives.
<p>
	The PRRA has strong possibilities for passing in this congressional session. Much ground work has been done and many co-sponsors have been secured. Chairman of key committees have promised support for The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act.
<p>
	However, the Children's Defense Fund and the National Education Association still wield a great deal of clout on Capitol Hill, and they can be expected to vigorously lobby to protect the legal prerogatives of bureaucrats. Using the pretense of "children's rights" these organizations will forcefully argue that government officials, and not parents, should have the ultimate authority to make decisions about the lives of children.
<p>
	The American family has been struggling to survive. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act will give families the needed relief and protection they need to preserve the family unit. Parents must act now and urge their Congressman and Senators to support The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act. 
<p>
	No child can have a greater gift than a loving parent who is free to make responsible decisions without fear of unreasonable interference by the government. Who do you trust to make educational choices, medical choices and religious education decisions for you: parents or the government?

We Need the Parental Rights
and Responsibilities Act Now!
<p>
</center>
Overview:</i></b>
<p>
	As a result of the recent changes in Congress, there is an ideal opportunity to pass H.R. 1946 and S. 984-the <i>Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (PRRA)</i>. The purpose of this act is to restore the rights of parents to control the upbringing and training of their children, rights that have been eroded by conflicting court decisions. The <i>PRRA</i> would reaffirm parents' rights including the fundamental right to direct or provide the education of their children, control the religious training of their children, make medical decisions for their minor children, and administer corporal discipline for their children. The <i>PRRA</i> offers strong protection to parents:
 
<blockquote><i>No federal, state, or local government or any official acting under color of law shall enter, shall interfere with or usurp the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children</i>.</blockquote>

	Furthermore, the <i>PRRA</i> would mandate that courts apply the "compelling interest test," which requires the state to prove that its regulations and intervention concerning parental rights must be essential and the least restrictive means. The act would also allow for parents to recover attorney's fees.
<p>
	Although parental rights and family freedoms are firmly established as "fundamental and beyond the reach of any court," lower courts and agencies have not prevented wholesale invasions of homes and families. Parental rights are under attack, and families across the nation are being harmed by a legal system that refuses to protect their fundamental rights.
<p>
	The <i>Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act</i> does not manufacture a single new federal program or create a need for new bureaucrats at any level of government. Rather, it simply establishes the legal standard to be employed in judging cases where the right of parents comes in conflict with the decisions or policies of government officials.
<p>
	The <i>Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act</i> re-affirms the bonds of families by allowing parents to direct the upbringing of their children and make choices for their families while establishing the legal standard to determine when the government can interfere in the family.
<p>
	The <i>PRRA</i> clearly establishes the fundamental right to raise one's child. However, just as the rights to free speech or religious freedom set forth in the Bill of Rights have their limits, the <i>PRRA</i> does not allow parents to abuse their children, keep them uneducated, or deny life-saving medical treatment. The <i>PRRA</i> re-affirms the right of parents to make the decisions that are within the law, without the govern-ment looking over their shoulder.

<b><i>Why Do We Need a Parental Rights Act Now?</i></b>
<p>
The reason the <i>Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act</i> is necessary is because the rights of parents have been slowly eroded away by numerous lower court decisions. The gradual erosion of parental freedom must be stopped now before it is too late. Below are numerous examples of how the rights of parents to educate, raise, discipline, and control their own children are being usurped in various court decisions.

	It is important to note that the Supreme Court employs two basic levels of protection in its analysis of constitutional rights. The higher level of protection is employed in cases involving "fundamental rights." Significantly lower levels of protections are provided to rights the Supreme Court has labeled "nonfundamental."
<p>
	For example, home school parents were thrilled by the excellent decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan in 1993, handled by the Home School Legal Defense Association, which declared that teacher's certification was unconstitutional as applied to religiously motivated home schooling parents. (<i>People v. DeJonge</i>, 501 N.W. 2d 127, 1993).

(<i>People v. Bennett</i>, 501 N.W. 2d 88, 1993). The difference between these two decisions was simple, but profound. The Michigan court held that religious freedom was a fundamental right whereas "parents' rights" were "nonfundamental" in nature.

<p>
<b><i>What You Can Do:</i></b> 
<p>
	<b>1. Call your two U.S. Senators and U.S. Representative</b> at (202) 224-3121 (Senate Switchboard) or (202) 225-3121 (House Switchboard). Every voter in each household should call to urge their Senators and Representative to actively support the PRRA. In the House the <i>PRRA</i> is known as H.R. 1946; in the Senate it's S. 984. (Already, volunteers in the National Center for Home Education's Congressional Action Program who live near the D.C. area have visited most Congressional offices with a packet of information and the full text of <i>PRRA</i>).
<p>
	<b>2. Let them know that you want them to support the <i>Parents' Rights and Responsibilities Act (PRRA)</i>.</b> Explain that the PRRA will secure and affirm a parent's rights to direct the upbringing and training of their children as guaranteed under the 14th Amendment.

<B>NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE STRATEGY DAY DE-BRIEFING</B><BR>

<P>Pooling their experience and desire to help families, home school leaders representing 48 states<BR>
gathered in Washington, D.C., on March 7 for the National Legislative Strategy Day<BR>
sponsored by Home School Legal Defense Association. A banquet the evening before gave<BR>
leaders a chance to renew old acquaintances and make new friends. But early Thursday morning,<BR>
participants were ready to seriously study the issues which will affect home schooling in the next<BR>
year.<BR>

<P>HSLDA attorneys Michael Farris, Christopher Klicka, and Doug Phillips briefed the home<BR>
school leaders on the latest developments and strategies concerning a host of federal issues. The<BR>
topics included the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, the national registry and<BR>
identification system in the Immigration bill, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the<BR>
Child, abolishing the federal role in education, and the Careers Act. Several U.S. Senators and<BR>
Representatives addressed the gathering on these issues, as well.<BR>

<P>Even with the days intense schedule, leaders found moments to laugh together, share hopeful<BR>
stories from their home states, and affirm the hard work of legislators who want to help the<BR>
family. Thunderous applause greeted each of the congressmen who took time out of their busy<BR>
schedules to address the group. Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) rallied the troops by calling out,<BR>
Christ is risen! eliciting the hearty response, He is risen indeed! <BR>

<P>On March 8, HSLDAs Congressional Action Program coordinated a full lobbying day on<BR>
Capitol Hill to coincide with the home school leaders visit to Washington. As constituents,<BR>
many of the leaders were able to meet directly with their U.S. Senators and Representatives.<BR>

<P>Afterwards, the leaders returned to their states, armed with information to spread throughout<BR>
their home school networks. <BR>

MICHAEL NEWS PETITION DENIED<BR>

<P>Michael News petition for writ of habeas corpus hearing was held on March 18, 1996. Michael<BR>
Farris, along with Herb Titus and lead counsel Ronald D. Ray, appeared before Judge Paul<BR>
Friedman in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to argue that the federal courts<BR>
should accept Army Specialist News case before the military courts have finished the appellate<BR>
process.<BR>

<P>Attorney Robert Shapiro (not the same attorney who represented O.J. Simpson) argued for the<BR>
government that the military should retain jurisdiction over Michael News discharge.<BR>

<P>Ten days later, Judge Friedman denied the petition. In his 18-page opinion, Judge Friedman<BR>
signaled that the New case is very important, but like the military judge he refused to rule on<BR>
the merits of the case.<BR>

<P>Friedman wrote, The consequences of holding that a serviceman on active duty can unilaterally<BR>
escape military jurisdiction . . . could be disruptive to military discipline, obedience, and<BR>
confidence.<BR>

<P>Colonel Ronald D. Ray, said of the ruling:<BR>
     The Clinton Administration admitted and does not dispute any of the defenses<BR>
     facts presented in the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus. The federal judge, like<BR>
     the military judge failed to rule upon the heart of the casethat the President<BR>
     clearly lacks any authority to order the wearing of the unauthorized UN uniform<BR>
     or the fact that the entire deployment to Macedonia was unlawful, not having the<BR>
     proper Congressional approval for this UN military mission staffed by U.S.<BR>
     soldiers.<BR>

<P>Judge Friedmans decision will be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, the next<BR>
step in the military court proceedings will be for General Montgomery Meigs, the Commanding<BR>
General, to rule on the bad-conduct discharge. Colonel Ray will travel to Germany to plead<BR>
Michael News case before the general.<BR>

<P>A Rebuttal  Guest Comment<BR>

<P>A Public School Principal Praises Home Schooling<BR>
     by Jim Green<BR>
Your Dec. 10 editorial, Trust but verify, has certainly given me much cause for concern. I<BR>
believe your focus on home schooling was good, healthy and thought provoking, but Id feel<BR>
better if you more accurately portrayed the public school system.<BR>

<P>I am a public school principal. My school, the Ida Flood Dodge Traditional School of<BR>
Educational Excellence, a Magnet Middle School, is home to students from about 60 public and<BR>
private elementaries.<BR>

<P>We are ethnically diverse and a rough representation of the Tucson Unified School District<BR>
middle school. My experience (5.5 years in this job) indicates that all is not wellor getting<BR>
betterin public education.<BR>

<P>Your editorial closed quoting Ted Sizers paradoxical ideal of a loose system that has rigor.<BR>
I maintain that our present public system is a loose system that lacks rigor.<BR>

<P>Several points in your editorial demand attention. Your lead paragraph opines that home<BR>
schooled children need a modest, unobtrusive, but still rigorous testing regime. Later you write<BR>
or perhaps districts could administer brief, focused tests every two years, the minimum<BR>
frequency professionals say can aid students and parents.<BR>

<P>At present tests are administered in fourth, seventh and 11th grades to public school students.<BR>
A student can fail all these tests and much of the course work and still be promoted.<BR>

<P>I my district, a seventh-grade student can fail the test, fail all four quarters of language arts and<BR>
mathematics and still be promoted. Worse, some schools promote all students regardless of<BR>
effort. Clever, but misguided, students know these conditions and are content to idly give away<BR>
their academic heritage.<BR>

<P>You suggest home school students showing poor progress should be returned to public education.<BR>
Where would you send the multitude of public school students doing poorly?<BR>

<P>Your article quotes Mary Grace Wendel, an education service coordinator for the Pima County<BR>
School Superintendents office. Wendels statement that parent attempts to avoid violence and<BR>
gang problems are negative rationales for home school is her opinion. I would term that a<BR>
positive rational.<BR>

<P>In spite of the police sweeps in downtown Tucson, nothing is really being done about truancy.<BR>
Juveniles roam this city in spite of school attendance law. I know several home schoolers and<BR>
they are doing a fine job of education.<BR>

<P>Your suspicion that home school may mean no school is no more likely to be accurate than<BR>
to say public school may mean no school.<BR>

<P>I do not mean to bash public schools. I am a public school product; my children were; and my<BR>
grandchildren all are public school students. Public school is my livelihood, and two of my<BR>
children are public school teachers.<BR>

<P>I am proud of Dodge Middle School, our dedicated, wonderful staff and of the vast majority of<BR>
our hard working, achieving students. However, all is not well in public education. It is my<BR>
opinion the problems of home schooling pale by comparison with the problems of public school.<BR>

<P>I also believe that if we appropriately address public school problems that home schooling will<BR>
essentially disappear. Home schooling consists of hard work with multiple preparations for up<BR>
to six subjects per day per student, multiplied by the number of children. In public school, we<BR>
cannot require a teacher to do more than three preparations.<BR>

<P>Surely if we can provide a safe, secure environment and a stimulating academic program, then<BR>
home schooling will be difficult to justify. However, if we fail to do so, home schooling may<BR>
be the majority classroom in the not too distant future.<BR>

<P>               Jim Green is the principal of Dodge Middle School.<BR>

<P>Recently, as I sat in a gathering of enthusiastic home educators, I was struck by the rich<BR>
common enterprise they have launchedan enterprise that flourishes despite the absence of<BR>
central planning or government assistance. . . . In the sweep of history, this is a radical idea,<BR>
and one still frequently challenged in many corners of the world. Yet in that roomand in the<BR>
vibrant grass-roots movement represented thereI saw confirmation that Americas founders<BR>
were right to put such faith in common people.<BR>

<B>COVER STORY:</B> RALLY DRAWS RECORD CROWD TO INDIANA CAPITOL<BR>

<P>Nearly 2,000 parents and children gathered inside the Capitol Building in Indianapolis on<BR>
Monday, March 4, making the Parental Rights Rally the second largest in the history of the<BR>
state. <BR>

<P>As the parental rights bill came under increased attack, the Indiana Association of Home<BR>
Educators and Home School Legal Defense Association worked together to quickly organize a<BR>
rally for the following week.<BR>

<P>On the day of the rally, home schooling families began arriving in Indianapolis from all over<BR>
the state. The crowd in the capital spilled over from the main hall into the upper balconies and<BR>
stairways, squeezing in to hear Christopher Klicka and several state legislators speak about<BR>
parental rights. After the rally, children delivered stuffed animals to each legislator. Every<BR>
animal wore a tag around its neck which read, Dear Representative/Senator, My parents know<BR>
best. All tags were signed by the children who donated the animals.<BR>

<P>Although the rally was covered by many local television stations and newspapers, it was given<BR>
only the barest notice in the largest Indiana paper, the Indianapolis Star, which has been running<BR>
articles featuring the Indiana State Teachers Associations opposition to the PRA. Indiana parents<BR>
continue to lobby their state representatives in hopes that the PRA will come up again in the next<BR>
legislative session. They hope repeated positive contact will convince legislators that parents<BR>
really do know best.<BR>

<P>
<P>H.B. 1346: THE OUTCOME<BR>

<P>Indiana went on a roller-coaster ride in February and March, as home schoolers went into a<BR>
pitched battle against the Indiana State Teachers Association, Planned Parenthood, and the rest<BR>
of Hillary Clintons village people. In November 1995, a Marion County Superior Court<BR>
judge ruled that parents have no fundamental Fourteenth Amendment right to direct the secular<BR>
education of their children. This ruling undercuts the constitutional basis for home schooling,<BR>
and turns the right to educate children at home into a government privilege. Indiana home<BR>
schools are treated as nonaccredited private schools, but this court ruling would subject that<BR>
status to the whims of the legislature.<BR>

<P>Home schoolers fought back in a massive rally at the Indiana state capitol on March 4, 1996.<BR>
Close to 2,000 people gathered to ask their legislators to send a strong signal in favor of parental<BR>
rights by supporting House Bill 1346. This legislation would guarantee that parents have the<BR>
fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children and guarantee parents certain due<BR>
process rights during child welfare investigations. <BR>

<P>The size of the crowd set records and made a significant impact on the entire legislature. The<BR>
legislature was supposed to wrap up its business some forty-eight hours after the rally, but the<BR>
battle over parental rights dragged the session out for the rest of the week. Although H.B. 1346<BR>
passed, the section declaring parents have a fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their<BR>
child was deleted. Senator Howard Luke Kenley [R-20th], who claims to be a pro-family<BR>
conservative, singlehandedly forced the removal of the parental rights language. The Indiana<BR>
State Teachers Association hot-line message has been thanking Senator Kenley for stopping the<BR>
parental rights bill.<BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Associations Michael Farris, Christopher Klicka, and Scott<BR>
Somerville all worked together to try to help Senator Kenley and other legislators understand the<BR>
constitutional dimensions of parents rights, and to help draft constitutionally appropriate<BR>
language protecting parents rights. Even through the parental rights language was removed from<BR>
H.B. 1346, the House and Senate did pass it in an amended form. As now written, it trims back<BR>
the child abuse investigations, puts some teeth in the laws against false and malicious child abuse<BR>
reports, and sets up a study committee to document how parental rights are being trampled in<BR>
Indiana. A special thanks goes to Representative John Padfield who led the charge for parents<BR>
rights.<BR>

<P>The net result? A first down, not a touchdown. Parents are better off than they were, but there<BR>
is still a long way to go. The Indiana Association of Home Educators and the Home School<BR>
Legal Defense Association are committed to continuing this battleeven though it will mean<BR>
direct confrontations with the teachers unionsuntil parents rights are clearly recognized under<BR>
Indiana law.<BR>

<B>NATIONAL CENTER REPORTS: </B>FREEDOM WATCH<BR>

<P>
<P>The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (H.R. 1946/S. 984)<BR>
The list of co-sponsors for the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (PRRA) has grown to<BR>
more than 130 in the House and 10 in the Senate. <BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Association and the National Center for Home Education have been<BR>
working with the congressional sponsors to fine-tune the language of the bill.<BR>

<P>On March 7, the National Center sponsored a legislative briefing on Capitol Hill for state home<BR>
school leaders from 46 states. Many congressmen addressed the group on the PRRA. On March<BR>
8, the National Center organized an intensive lobbying day with our Congressional Action<BR>
Program volunteers and visiting state home school leaders. Many of the participants were able<BR>
to personally visit with U.S. Senators and Representatives to gain support for the PRRA and<BR>
immigration/tracking amendment (see accompanying article).<BR>

<P>The House and Senate sub-committees currently considering the PRRA are expected to issue<BR>
favorable reports. At this time, however, no dates have been set for the PRRA to be considered<BR>
by the full Judiciary Committees in either chamber.<BR>

<P>Action: Home schoolers need to continue to deliver a steady stream of calls to their Senators<BR>
and Representatives to build support for the PRRA. The implications of this bill make it a<BR>
priority.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child<BR>
Thirty-seven Senators have expressed their opposition in writing to the ratification of the U.N.<BR>
Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, the battle is not over. Left-wing childrens<BR>
rights groups are heavily lobbying the Clinton Administration and selected Senators for<BR>
ratification. <BR>

<P>On January 17, 1996, UNICEF issued a press release titled, Child Rights Convention Close<BR>
to Universal Acceptance With 186 Ratifications; Only Six More to Go. It began, <BR>
     The United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) today announced that only six<BR>
     countries remained until universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of<BR>
     the Child. The Convention has broken all records as the most widely accepted<BR>
     human rights treaty in history with the ratification by 186 state parties. . . . <BR>
          The only six countries in the world which have yet to ratify are<BR>
     Switzerland, United States, Oman, Saudi Arabia, United Emirates, and Somalia.<BR>
     Switzerland and the United States have already signed indicating their intention<BR>
     to ratify. . . . <BR>
          Ratification of the Convention obligates governments to bring their laws<BR>
     in line with the Convention. . . . <BR>
          But ratification of the Convention is itself just another step in a much<BR>
     bigger process. Governments, communities, and children themselves must work<BR>
     together to make the Convention a living charter for childrens rights. In bringing<BR>
     a new legal focus of childrens issues, countries are now enacting new laws, and<BR>
     amending national legislation to conform with the Conventions provisions.<BR>
     Special legal codes for children have been promulgated. Reports to the Committee<BR>
     of the Rights of the Child, and other sources cites specific examples of basic<BR>
     measures countries are taking to comply with the Convention. <BR>
          In Mexico, for instance, the constitutionally recognized Convention is<BR>
     considered supreme law of the land.<BR>

<P>Action: Remain vigilant. Remember, unratified treaties never die; they can always be brought<BR>
up for a vote. Home schoolers are encouraged to continue sending letters to their Senators,<BR>
reminding them to vote against ratification. <BR>

<P>Abolishing the Federal Role in Education<BR>
Home School Legal Defense Association and the National Center for Home Education are<BR>
continuing to meet with Senators and Congressmen to promote the Restoring Local Schools Act.<BR>
Home schoolers should wait to encourage their legislators to sign on as co-sponsors until a<BR>
sponsor is secured and a bill number assigned.<BR>

<P>A number of the of the Republican presidential candidates advocated abolishment of the<BR>
Department of Education. This is significant, because the more that the issue is debated, the<BR>
more palatable abolishment becomes to the body politic.<BR>

<P>The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution of Arlington, Virginia, has released a paper entitled, Who<BR>
Got It Right? What Proponents and Opponents of the Creation of the Department of Education<BR>
Promised and Predicted. The two aspects of the study which are particularly significant are a)<BR>
an account of the origin of the Department of Education, and b) statistics showing the poor track<BR>
record of the Department of Education.<BR>

<P>The paper, authored by John E. Berthoud, Ph.D., Vice President of the Alexis de Tocqueville<BR>
Institution, focuses on six key areas: 1) benefits for school children; 2) overhead &amp; bureaucracy;<BR>
3) efficiency; 4) local control; 5) cost; and 6) values. For each area Dr. Berthoud quotes what<BR>
the supporters promised, what the opponents predicted (see below), and then, based on the data<BR>
of the last 17 years, demonstrates the reality that Department of Education has reduced local<BR>
control, increased the cost, reduced the efficiency, and eroded the values of public education.<BR>

<P>Opponents to the establishment of the Department of Education:<BR>
Senator Moynihan and I have joined in opposing this bill. We have both been teachers for a<BR>
long time. But it appears that our colleagues would rather listen to the unfounded pleas of people<BR>
who know only that there are problems in our schools today, but who do not know how to solve<BR>
them. . . . I wish someone would tell me how this new department is going to make our children<BR>
literate? Or how it will erase the violence that has erupted in our schools? . . .<BR>

<P>The Immigration Control and Financial Responsibilities Act<BR>
Senate Bill 269 and its companion bill, H.R. 2202, provide classic examples of a case of the<BR>
cure being worse than the disease. Attempting to deal with the nations illegal immigration<BR>
problem, these bills create a greater problem by proposing the establishment of a national<BR>
database to verify the employment eligibility of every American worker. The National Center<BR>
for Home Education and Home School Legal Defense Association oppose all national tracking<BR>
systems and are working against those aspects of this legislation.<BR>

<P>A diverse coalition of more than fifty organizations has formed to oppose the identification and<BR>
tracking provisions in these bills. The National Center and HSLDA have signed a coalition letter<BR>
addressed to the United States Senate expressing unqualified opposition to anything resembling<BR>
a national worker identification card, national worker registry, or any other comprehensive<BR>
national database. The National Center also formed another coalition comprised of many pro-<BR>
family groups which has had a positive impact as well.<BR>

<P>In the Senate, the full Judiciary Committee mark up for S. 269 began on February 29, 1996.<BR>
The coalition hopes to split the bill in half, separating the legal and illegal immigration sections. <BR>
Senators Russell Feingold (D-WI) and Spencer Abraham (R-MI) are working with our coalition<BR>
to kill, by floor amendment, the national tracking registry. <BR>

<P>Knowing that the situation was grim, the National Center launched a surgical strike fax alert<BR>
on March 4 asking home schoolers to call members of the Judiciary Committee and urge support<BR>
of the Abraham/Feingold amendment. The amendment failed in the Judiciary Committee by a<BR>
9 to 9 vote. The split in the vote, however, indicates that the amendment will be successful on<BR>
the Senate floor.<BR>

<P>Meanwhile, Feingold and Abraham have introduced S. 1535, which removes the national<BR>
registry requirements, increases the penalties for illegal immigration, and boosts law<BR>
enforcement. It is expected to be voted on in the full Senate in mid-April.<BR>

<P>In the House, a floor vote on H.R. 2202 took place in the U.S. House of Representatives on<BR>
March 20. Representative Steve Chabot (R-OH) offered a floor amendment to kill the registry<BR>
portion of the House version of the bill. The National Center and Home School Legal Defense<BR>
Association launched a nationwide alert to remove the onerous provisions of the bill which<BR>
would create an expanded national registry and require employers to call a 1-800-big-brother<BR>
number to seek approval before hiring someone. <BR>

<P>Although the Chabot amendment failed, the thousands of calls pouring into the House effectively<BR>
killed Representative Elton Galleglys (R-CA) amendment by a vote of 86 ayes to 331 nays<BR>
(14 members did not vote). The Gallegly amendment would have made the 1-800-big-brother<BR>
number mandatory. Also, the calls contributed to Lamar Smith, the sponsor of the bill, changing<BR>
the national registry provision from mandatory to voluntary just days before the vote.<BR>

<P>Action: Home schoolers and all concerned citizens need to immediately contact their U.S.<BR>
Senators and ask them to vote for the Abraham/Feingold amendment to eliminate all national<BR>
registry provisions to S. 269.<BR>

<P><B>ACROSS THE STATES</B><BR>

<P>CALIFORNIA: CORPORAL PUNISHMENTIS IT A NO-NO? <BR>

<P>The number of Home School Legal Defense Association member families who are contacted by<BR>
social workers continues to rise. Contacts are based upon either anonymous or identified<BR>
individual complaints alleging that the families are abusing and/or neglecting their children. One<BR>
constant theme throughout the complaints is that the type of discipline the parents administer to<BR>
the children is abusive (i.e. spanking).<BR>

<P>Many people do not believe any child should be disciplined with corporal punishment. But<BR>
despite the fact that most social workers regularly tell parents they do not have a right to spank<BR>
their children, or that they can only spank their children with their hand, this is not the law in<BR>
California. <BR>

<P>The law provides that reasonable, age-appropriate spanking cannot of itself be considered abuse<BR>
or neglect of a child. There is nothing in the California statutes that prohibits a parent from<BR>
using an object, other than the hand, to administer the corporal punishment. <BR>

<P>It must be clearly stated, however, that any abuse to a child which occurs during administration<BR>
of corporal punishment will be presumed child abuse by the child protective industry. The<BR>
burden will be on the parent to demonstrate otherwise.<BR>

<P>In light of the above, here are a few suggestions advocated by child psychiatrists and<BR>
pediatricians for parents who use corporal punishment as one of the means of disciplining their<BR>
children:<BR>

<P>1.   Do not spank your children or anyone elses children in public or outside the confines<BR>
     of your home. The windows and doors of your home should be secured when<BR>
     administering corporal discipline. Spanking should be done in private.<BR>

<P>2.   Avoid spanking someone elses child unless you have clear written authority to do so.<BR>

<P>3.   Do not administer corporal discipline when angry. A spanking is most effective<BR>
     administered immediately after the childs offense.<BR>

<P>4.   Use corporal discipline only for clearly understood and intentional disobedience.<BR>

<P>5.   Clearly explain to the child why corporal discipline is being administered.<BR>

<P>6.   After the discipline, always affectionately express your love for your child. A verbal<BR>
     review of the offense and verbal reassurance of the parents unconditional love for the<BR>
     child should be conveyed.<BR>

<P>7.   Spanking should always be administered with regard for the childs age and development.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>School Districts Assert Authority<BR>
Public school districts continue to attempt to assert authority over private schools that they<BR>
simply do not have. For example, one school recently sent out to private/home schools an<BR>
Application for Exemption From Attendance at a Public School. The application required<BR>
pupil information, including name, address, date of birth, and grade; and parent or legal<BR>
guardian information.<BR>

<P>The cover letter requested the private/home school administrator to indicate what exemption the<BR>
parent/administrator is claiming, i.e., the tutorial exemption, the private school exemption, or<BR>
the independent study exemption. The application asked the parent to provide information<BR>
regarding the tutor, the private school, or the public school administering the independent study<BR>
program.<BR>

<P>It is true that California law does give public school districts the authority to verify that a child<BR>
not enrolled in public school meets one of the attendance exemptions. However, that verification<BR>
is to be initiated by a complaint that a parent or guardian does not have his child in a legal<BR>
exemption from public school attendance.<BR>

<P>Some school district officials view home schooling as legal only through the tutorial<BR>
exemptionwhich means instruction is done by a certified teacher. If the private school affidavit<BR>
lists six students or less, these districts presume it is a home school and send a letter<BR>
accompanied by a form for the parents to complete and return. <BR>

<P>In most cases, the public school does not know the names, ages, or number of children who are<BR>
of compulsory school age in the family. The form is simply a fishing expeditionwithout the<BR>
names and ages of the children, the public school does not have sufficient information to pursue<BR>
a truancy complaint.<BR>

<P>HSLDA continues to inform such school districts that the private schools will not respond to this<BR>
type of inquiry and that the form exceeds the authority of the school district as pronounced in<BR>
the California Education Code.<BR>

<P>Lucia Mar Unified School District Requests Proof of Certification<BR>
The Lucia Mar Unified School District, a school district in San Louis Obispo County, sent a<BR>
letter to all the small private schools that had filed private school affidavits indicating that the<BR>
only legal way to home school was under the exemption which requires the tutor to be a certified<BR>
teacher. The parents were told that if they did not send a copy of their teaching certificate to the<BR>
district by March 3, 1996, their private school affidavit would be referred to the School<BR>
Attendance Review Board (SARB). The implication of this threat is that the school district would<BR>
challenge their right to home school under the private school exemption. The school district<BR>
indicated that the letter was sent at the instruction of the State Department of Education. The<BR>
letter also urged parents to attend a meeting for the purpose of learning about the independent<BR>
study program the school district is planning to launch in September 1996. <BR>

<P>Michael Smith told HSLDA members not to attend the meeting and assured the parents that their<BR>
private school legally exempts their children from the requirement of being instructed in a public<BR>
school or tutored by a certified teacher. <BR>

<P>In addition, Vice President Smith forwarded a letter to the Assistant Superintendent informing<BR>
the school district of its incorrect interpretation of the law in California as it relates to home<BR>
schoolers. The letter advised the school district that the SARB did not have any authority over<BR>
private schools, only over students alleged to be truant. The students in attendance in the private<BR>
schools which received the letter are exempt from public school attendance. Therefore, the<BR>
SARB has no authority at all over the students enrolled and receiving instruction in the private<BR>
schools.<BR>

<P>The school district responded by letter to the families, cancelling the scheduled independent<BR>
study program meeting and apologizing for any misunderstanding the letter may have created.<BR>
However, there has been no indication whether the Lucia Mar Unified School District will turn<BR>
over the home educating families private school affidavits to the SARB. Stay tuned for further<BR>
developments.<BR>

<P>Los Angeles County Assesses Processing Fee<BR>
HSLDA has been informed by home schoolers in Los Angeles County that they have received<BR>
phone calls from the LA County Board of Education informing them that their private school<BR>
affidavits have not been properly filed because they failed to pay the $25.00 processing fee. The<BR>
school official informs the parents they are not legal and tells them where to send the<BR>
processing fee. <BR>

<P>HSLDA instructed our member families not to pay the processing fee and to forward their<BR>
affidavits directly to the Department of Education in Sacramento via certified mail with a return<BR>
receipt requested. Member families who filed their affidavit and received the return receipt need<BR>
not be concerned about receiving such a call. Simply inform any caller from the Los Angeles<BR>
County Board of Education that you have filed the affidavit with the Superintendent of Public<BR>
Instruction as required by the private school law (Ed. Code  48222) and you have a certified<BR>
mail return receipt as proof that it was received and properly filed with the State Board of<BR>
Education. <BR>

<P>There is nothing further you need to do. However, any member family who receives further<BR>
contact by telephone or letter should immediately contact the HSLDA legal department for<BR>
guidance.<BR>

<P>IOWA: FAMILY FIGHTS BACK AGAINST DHS<BR>

<P>Howard and Debbie Taylor are a typical Iowa home schooling family, with this difference:<BR>
Debbies mother is described by her whole family as paranoid, and Debbies sister is a public<BR>
school teacher. When Howard and Debbie spanked their three-year-old at a family gathering last<BR>
year, Debbies mother and sister went ballistic. They threatened to call social services<BR>
immediately and have the children taken away. Grandmothers have rights! Aunts have rights!<BR>
they shouted, as Howard and Debbie gathered up their children and fled (with the remains of<BR>
a birthday cake in their arms) from the home.<BR>

<P>One year later, those threats came true. Social workers appeared at the door demanding to see<BR>
the children. Debbie refused. The social worker went to court asking for an order to enter the<BR>
home and talk to the children. The judge, acting completely contrary to law, wrote out a court<BR>
order to seize the children and bring them to the courthouse. After hours of interrogation, the<BR>
social workers had blown the original allegations up into a wild tale of ritual bondage and<BR>
dangerous behavior. The court-appointed guardian ad litem described the parents as exhibiting<BR>
a Ruby Ridge mentality.<BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Association attorney Scott Somerville flew in to assist local attorney<BR>
Ray Sullins at a hearing challenging the order removing the children. After a two-day trial<BR>
attended by over 120 spectators, DHS agreed to release the children and give the family an<BR>
opportunity to challenge the taped interview through expert testimony. Debbie Taylor fell to her<BR>
knees as her seven-year-old daughter ran through the courtroom door. My baby! My baby!<BR>
Debbie cried as she gathered her little girl into her arms.<BR>

<P>Iowas Department of Human Services blatantly disregarded the statutes when enforcing the<BR>
protective orders to remove the Taylor children from their home. Attorneys Sullins and<BR>
Somerville documented almost a dozen different procedural errors in this case. Given the lawless<BR>
acts of DHS, even though the Taylor children may be home, it is clear that this case is far from<BR>
over. Please pray that the Taylors traumatic experience will work out to change the whole Iowa<BR>
child abuse system.<BR>

<P>
<P>KENTUCKY: HOME VISITS REVISITED<BR>

<P>A letter from the pupil personnel direct for Caldwell County announced that she will be<BR>
conducting home visits during the months of March and April. The letter, sent to home<BR>
schoolers in the county who notified under the private school statue, instructed the parents to<BR>
prepare and produce a portfolio of each childs work, attendance records, student progress<BR>
reports and the curriculum for the subjects taught.<BR>

<P>The director of pupil personnel cited Kentucky Revised Statute 159.040 for the authority to<BR>
conduct the home visit and review the education records. Section 1590.040 reads as follows:<BR>

<P>     Attendance at private and parochial schools shall be kept by the authorities of<BR>
     such schools in a register provided by the state board for elementary and<BR>
     secondary education, and such school authorities shall make attendance and<BR>
     scholarship reports in the same manner as is required by law or by regulation of<BR>
     the state board for elementary and secondary education of public school officials.<BR>
     Such schools shall at all times be open to inspection by directors of pupil<BR>
     personnel and officials of the department of education.<BR>

<P>Michael Smith, Vice President of Home School Legal Defense Association, responded on behalf<BR>
of the families pointing out that the above code section does provide that private schools will<BR>
keep attendance records and scholarship reports in the same manner as required for public<BR>
schools, but that the statute does not require those reports to be available to public school<BR>
officials. <BR>

<P>Public school officials argue that because private schools are to be open to inspection, the<BR>
inspection must mean an inspection of the attendance and scholarship reports. This argument<BR>
does not hold water because the statute does not specify what is to be inspected. Additionally,<BR>
the request to view a portfolio of each childs work and the curriculum for the subjects taught<BR>
is not mentioned anywhere in the statute.<BR>

<P>The rule of law in situations like this one is that unless the legislature specifically provides<BR>
authority to a governmental agency or employee to perform a specific function, the authority is<BR>
reserved to the people. Since the Kentucky Statute does not specifically give authority to public<BR>
school officials to inspect attendance and scholarship reports, school officials cannot compel<BR>
private school officials to turn over for inspection the aforementioned reports.<BR>

<P>The Supreme Court of Kentucky has given guidance regarding the issue of governmental<BR>
interference in the affairs of private schools in the case of Kentucky State Board of Elementary<BR>
and Secondary Education v. Rudasill, 589 SW 2d 877. The Supreme Court found that the state<BR>
did have a compelling interest to see that children in Kentucky are educated to become good<BR>
citizens and that children be prepared to intelligently exercise the right of suffrage. However,<BR>
the states interest may not be enforced at the expense of conscience or at the expense of<BR>
diversity of the parents and their children.<BR>

<P>The Court ruled that the state had to use the least restrictive means available where private<BR>
schools and parents assert that state activity interfere with their freedom to direct the education<BR>
of the children. A home visit to inspect records clearly is not the least restrictive alternative<BR>
available to local school districts to ensure private schools meet the states compelling interest<BR>
in education.<BR>

<P>Additionally, private schools conducted in homes are protected by the Fourth Amendment to the<BR>
United States Constitution which protects citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures.<BR>
With few exceptions, entry into a home against the consent of the occupants can only be<BR>
accomplished by the issuance of a warrant based upon probable cause. <BR>

<P>HSLDA also informed the director of pupil personnel that the occupants of the homes did not<BR>
consent to home visits. Therefore, any attempt to enter the home without the consent of the<BR>
occupants would be considered a violation of the occupants civil rights. As of March 18, 1996,<BR>
none of the families who received the directors letter have been contacted by the district, nor<BR>
have any attempts been made to exercise home visits.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>MAINE: COMMISSIONERS LETTER CAUSES CONFUSION<BR>

<P>On December 14, 1995, Dr. Wayne L. Mowatt, Maine Commissioner of Education, directed<BR>
a letter to district superintendents regarding non-approved private schools. The letter stated, It<BR>
has come to my attention that an increasing number of students are enrolling in non-approved<BR>
private schools that are actually home schooling programs. <BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Association attorney Scott Somerville wrote to Dr. Edwin N.<BR>
Kastuck of the Maine Department of Education asking for clarification, I am confused as to<BR>
what Dr. Mowatt means when he says something is actually a home schooling program.<BR>
Attorney Somervilles letter went on to explain that under Maine law, only individual families<BR>
are eligible to apply for equivalent instruction through home instruction, which Dr. Mowatts<BR>
office usually handles. Any families working together to educate their children in a cooperative<BR>
manner are excluded from applying under these regulations, since any regular instructional<BR>
program conducted for purposes of the compulsory attendance law which enrolls two or more<BR>
unrelated students is defined to be a school under chapter 130  1(C).<BR>

<P>The Maine Supreme Court has ruled the presence or absence of an objective third party makes<BR>
a critical difference under Maines education law, Blount v. Department of Educational and<BR>
Cultural Services, 551 A.2d 1377 (Me. 1988). Families who seek the benefit of such cooperative<BR>
schooling arrangements should not be precluded from using them just because Maines home<BR>
school regulations only apply to individual families.<BR>

<P>Private schools all over the country have found that home schoolers are eager to enroll in their<BR>
programs and benefit from their resources. It is important to note that Maines rules for<BR>
equivalent instruction programs define a school as any instructional program conducted for<BR>
purposes of compulsory attendance law which enrolls two or more unrelated students. [Rules,<BR>
 1(C), emphasis added.] These cooperative school arrangements clearly fall within the<BR>
definition of these rules.<BR>

<P>Maine home schools are well within their rights to choose a cooperative school arrangement, but<BR>
we can expect new challenges from state officials who prefer their own opinions over the<BR>
language of the law.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>NEW MEXICO: Phone Calls Kill H.B. 337<BR>

<P>In February, Home School Legal Defense Association sent out a legislative alert to its members<BR>
in New Mexico regarding House Bill 337, introduced by Barbara Casey of Rosewell. The<BR>
proposed legislation would have amended the home school law by striking the requirement that<BR>
home school teachers have a high school diploma and replacing it with the requirement that<BR>
home schooled students receive instruction in a manner that is substantially comparable to that<BR>
required . . . . for students in public school. Had this language been adopted, it would have<BR>
opened up the potential for home schools to be regulated by public schools.<BR>

<P>Phil Schultz, President of New Mexico Christian Home Educators, informed HSLDA that H.B.<BR>
337 did not get out of committee because the co-sponsors received enough telephone calls to<BR>
cause them to withdraw their support.<BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Association members who responded to our alert are to be<BR>
congratulated: your time and effort were well invested. Telephone calls do make a difference.<BR>

<P>There is a very good possibility, however, that this legislation will be introduced again next<BR>
year, and we will have to go through the process once more. Should another telephone blitz be<BR>
necessary, we trust that home schooling families will have the same faithfulness to respond, to<BR>
make the telephone calls, to participate in democracy, and to protect their freedom and their<BR>
families.<BR>

<P>OHIO: SPREADING CONFUSION<BR>

<P>An article appeared in the December 1995 issue of the Ohio School Boards Association<BR>
newsletter which has caused concern in the home school community. This newsletter is read by<BR>
virtually every superintendent in the state of Ohio, and misinformation regarding the current<BR>
home school regulations could have a very detrimental affect on the working relationship<BR>
between many superintendents and home schoolers. <BR>

<P>Entitled, Staying Home: A Look at Home Education, the article was written by staff attorney<BR>
Adam C. Miller. The central problem with the analysis of the current home school requirements<BR>
revolves around preeminence given to the compulsory attendance law found in Ohio Revised<BR>
Code Ann.  3321.04(A)(2) over the home school regulations established by the State Board of<BR>
Education. <BR>

<P>The author fails to recognize, first, that the legislature authorized the State Board of Education<BR>
to draft regulations for home education. Second, the principle of law which governs in this<BR>
situation is that the specific always overrides the general. In other words, the Administrative<BR>
Code Regulations on home education are controlling in this situation (the specific guidelines),<BR>
not the Ohio Revised Code (the general discretionary authority of the superintendent). The very<BR>
purpose of the regulations was to bring uniform application to the excusal of home schooled<BR>
children from public school attendance by the public school superintendent.<BR>

<P>
<P>According to the article, superintendents are given a high degree of discretion in approving<BR>
home school programs. Again, the author draws this conclusion from his interpretation of the<BR>
Ohio Revised Code, which states that a child is excused from public school attendance if it is<BR>
demonstrated:<BR>

<P>     (2) That he is being instructed at home by a person qualified to teach the<BR>
     branches in which instruction is required, and such additional branches, as the<BR>
     advancement and needs of the child may, in the opinion of such superintendent,<BR>
     require. (emphasis added)<BR>

<P>Numerous inaccurate statements regarding the authority of the superintendent and what is<BR>
required of home educators follow as the article continues. <BR>

<P>If the superintendent is dissatisfied with the [curriculum] plan, he or she can require a<BR>
parentwithin 14 daysto provide more written information or to present additional information<BR>
at a conference. Contrary to the authors opinion, the curriculum information is submitted to<BR>
demonstrate that the required subjects are being taught, NOT FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE<BR>
SUPERINTENDENT. The authority given to the superintendent in the regulations is to review<BR>
materials submitted to make ensure the regulations are being complied with, not for evaluation.<BR>

<P>In the same vein, the author tells the superintendent that he or she has the authority to evaluate<BR>
the home education program to see if it meets the childs needs. The article states:<BR>

<P>     Clearly, the superintendent must conduct a reasonable inquiry to whether the<BR>
     child has any special needs and whether the plan for home education meets these<BR>
     needs. This can include, but is not limited to, special education, gifted education<BR>
     and remedial education.<BR>

<P>The State Board has already determined what information is required to satisfy the states<BR>
interest in education. That information is contained in the notification requirement. Nowhere in<BR>
the regulations is such broad authority given to the superintendent to evaluate and approve any<BR>
home education program. <BR>

<P>The article continues, Parents are encouraged to treat the code requirements as a minimum and<BR>
update the superintendent and staff regularly as to their childs progress and proficiency. This<BR>
issue was clearly addressed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction at the time the<BR>
regulations were enacted. In a memorandum by the Superintendent of Public Instruction<BR>
addressed to local superintendents the questions was raised, Are the requirements in Rule 3301-<BR>
34-02 just minimum standards that local districts can exceed? The answer was an emphatic<BR>
No. These are rules of the State Board that carry the same effect as law, and school districts<BR>
may not exceed these standards.<BR>

<P>The author asserts that each superintendent is able to draft his/her own policy regarding home<BR>
schoolingbut this is the very problem intended to be corrected by the State Board when the<BR>
regulations were drafted in 1989. The Administrative Regulations are the current law on home<BR>
schooling, not the local superintendent and/or school board.<BR>

<P>The author attempted to provide a summary of the regulation requirements for notification and<BR>
assessment, but again, he promulgated misinformation. He states that under the assessment<BR>
option, the childrens tests must be taken with the rest of the students in the district as<BR>
scheduled during the year. Any person who has carefully read the home school regulations<BR>
knows that standardized testing of home school students may be provided independent of the<BR>
school district as long as it is administered by a person duly authorized by the publisher of the<BR>
test.<BR>

<P>It is because this type of legal advice is provided to local school districtseven after seven years<BR>
of operating under the State Board of Educations regulationsthat home schoolers continue to<BR>
encounter many difficulties with school districts, even when they are actually in compliance with<BR>
the law.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>SOUTH DAKOTA SCORES TWO MAJOR VICTORIES!<BR>

<P>For years, South Dakota families and local school districts have battled over the requirement that<BR>
home schooled children be tested with the same standardized tests used in the public schools.<BR>
Many families object to this, wanting their children to be evaluated by means that measure what<BR>
their children have learned, not what the public school children have learned. These conflicts<BR>
came to a head two years ago, when home schoolers discovered that the most common school<BR>
district test, the MAT-7, had a number of questions that were really shocking to Christian<BR>
families.<BR>

<P>A number of Home School Legal Defense Association members refused to test their children<BR>
with the MAT-7 tests. In response, many of the school districts threaten the parents with court<BR>
action.<BR>

<P>With the consent of the test publisher, HSLDA carefully scrutinized the MAT-7 test questions<BR>
and found some of them to be heavily weighted against traditional moral values and in favor of<BR>
politically correct attitudes. HSLDA attorney Christopher Klicka was able to convince the<BR>
superintendents to hold off prosecution for that year, but the root problemthe wording of the<BR>
lawremained.<BR>

<P>HSLDA drafted language to change the law as it pertained to the testing requirements and<BR>
forwarded it to the South Dakota home school leaders. Aspects of the language were finally<BR>
incorporated into H.R. 1286 which improved South Dakotas testing requirements for home<BR>
school children in two significant ways. First, children may now be tested with any national<BR>
achievement test. And second, the legislation also ended the requirement that families have<BR>
children tested annually. Now, children are only required to be tested in the same grades that<BR>
public school children must be tested. <BR>

<P>By Gods grace, Governor William J. Janklow signed House Bill 1286 into law on March 4,<BR>
1996,. Families with significant objections to the MAT-7 should call HSLDA about testing this<BR>
spring. All families will be able to select any nationally standardized achievement tests starting<BR>
in the 1996-1997 school year.<BR>

<P>The other bill signed into law on March 4 was House Bill 1279, an act to provide additional<BR>
safeguards against false and malicious reports of abuse and neglect. This was an unusually well-<BR>
written and much-needed amendment to the law, which prohibited the Department of Social<BR>
Services from removing any portion of their records that would tend to prove, affirm,<BR>
corroborate, or support the innocence of the subject of a child abuse report without express<BR>
written authority of the subject of the child abuse report. In an entirely new section of the Code,<BR>
any subject of an unfounded report of child abuse or neglect who believes that the report was<BR>
made in bad faith or malicious intent may petition the court for the release of the records of the<BR>
investigation. This finally makes it possible for families who are maliciously hot-lined to defend<BR>
themselves.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>VIRGINIA: S.B. 621 DEFEATED<BR>

<P>All Virginia Home School Legal Defense Association member families received a letter in late<BR>
February asking them to mobilize against Senate Bill 621. <BR>

<P>Virginia is unique in having the highest degree of protection for parents of any state in the<BR>
country. In 1995, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled that the Department of Social Services<BR>
may not identify an allegation of child abuse or neglect as founded without clear and<BR>
convincing evidence of abuse. Every other state permits families to be identified as abusive<BR>
with much less proofin fact, the reality in most states is that families are founded as abusive<BR>
on a mere suspicion of abuse with any evidence to support it.<BR>

<P>Senate Bill 621 was going to remove this protection for Virginia families. On February 8, 1996,<BR>
Senator Stolle amended in the following language: That standard of proof in determining<BR>
whether a report of abuse or neglect is founded shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.<BR>
This language would have nullified the Court of Appeals ruling that the proper standard should<BR>
be clear and convincing evidence. When it came to a vote, the senators split 20 to 20 on this<BR>
bill. Lieutenant Governor Don Beyer cast the deciding vote against parental rights.<BR>

<P>As usual, home schoolers responded with lightning speed to a threat to their freedoms. When<BR>
this bill reached the House committee, it was promptly killed. God deserves all the glory for<BR>
stopping this bill for without His protection, this bill would almost certainly have become law.<BR>

<P>
<P>Triennial School Census<BR>
Every three years, Home School Legal Defense Association is barraged with telephone calls<BR>
from Virginia home school parents who have just received the school census and are inquiring<BR>
whether they are mandated to participate. We advise our member families that participation in<BR>
the school census is voluntary and they may decide for themselves whether or not to take part.<BR>

<P>There are a number of reasons home schooling families may decide not to participate in the<BR>
school census. The primary reason, however, is tax dollars. The schools receive funding based<BR>
on the number of children in the district. Many home schoolers do not want their tax dollars to<BR>
go to the public school system and their only opportunity to voice their conscientious objection<BR>
comes once every three years, when they just say no to the school census.<BR>

<P>Of course, if tuition tax credit legislation is ever enacted, home schoolers will be relieved of this<BR>
double burden. Until that time, many Virginia families will no doubt continue to exercise their<BR>
legal option and refuse to participate in the school census.<BR>

<P>In summary, Home School Legal Defense Association does not advise any family to not<BR>
participate in the school census. We merely respond that participation is not required by law,<BR>
and explain to sincere religious families that non-participation provides one way to express their<BR>
religious objection to the religious vacuum of the public schools. Each family is left to decide<BR>
according to their own convictions.<BR>

<B>UNSUNG HEROES REVISITED</B><BR>
In the last issue of the Court Report we printed a letter from a mother who asked us to recognize<BR>
the other unsung hero of home educationthe fathers who lay down their lives for their families.<BR>

<P>Her honest account of the struggles her family is facing prompted an outpouring of love from<BR>
HSLDA members across the country. We have received letters and telephone calls from<BR>
members who were touched by the letter and wanted to communicate their support, empathy,<BR>
and encouragement to this family. Unfortunately, I cannot do that directly because the letter was<BR>
truly anonymous. The mother signed it name withheld, and the envelope did not bear a return<BR>
address.<BR>

<P>God has used this mothers letter and the response of HSLDA members to build our faith and<BR>
encourage us. We are privileged at HSLDA to be able to share in the joys and sorrows of many<BR>
of our member families. You share with us your childrens accomplishments, send us birth<BR>
announcements, and fondly bid us good-bye when your last child has graduated. But we also<BR>
hear from families who are struggling to survive. Sometimes the difficult circumstances involve<BR>
job loss, illness, or even the death of a mother, father, or child. And sometimes we hear from<BR>
families who arent survivingone parent has abandoned the family, leaving his or her spouse<BR>
and children hurting and alone.<BR>

<P>As HSLDA members have reached out to express love and encouragement to this unknown<BR>
family, we have been privileged to hear their stories. Moms and dads who have called or written<BR>
have struggled through some very dark days. Some are still struggling. Yet they offer their<BR>
testimonies of what God has done and is doing for them. Through His power and grace they are<BR>
overcoming!<BR>

<P>Even though we cannot communicate directly with this family, we can uphold them in<BR>
prayerfaithfully interceding for them and for other home schooling families across our nation<BR>
who face difficult circumstances.<BR>
And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in<BR>
mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints Ephesians 6:18.<BR>

<P>Praise God for the excellent turnout at the recent parental rights rally in Indiana, and pray that<BR>
God would continue to use the home school families in that state to reach their legislators with<BR>
the message of parental rights. House Bill 1346, a parental rights bill, was passed, but the<BR>

deleted. Praise God that freedom has been strengthened, and pray for Indiana home schoolers<BR>

<B>LITIGATION REPORT: </B>HOW OUR CASES ARE STACKING UP<BR>

<P>ARKANSAS<BR>
Rudolph &amp; Jolynn Jones v. State Department of Education  A civil rights lawsuit has been<BR>
filed on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Jones who are home schooling four children. Arkansas law<BR>
requires home-schooled children to take an annual standardized achievement test and to<BR>
reimburse the state a fee of $35.00 per test. Mr. Jones has been injured and reinjured on the job<BR>
within the last few years and cannot afford to pay the requisite fee. An inability to pay the fee<BR>
would result in the revocation of his familys legal home school status.<BR>

<P>Both sides have asked the judge to rule on the case without the necessity of a trial. Home School<BR>
Legal Defense Association contends that the Arkansas reimbursement statute violates the Jones<BR>
familys fundamental right to direct the education of their children when coupled with their right<BR>
to the free exercise of religion. We argue that the state cannot show a compelling interest in the<BR>
fee sufficient to justify such a law. The State Department of Education, on the other hand,<BR>
argues first that Mr. and Mrs. Jones are not indigent, but can afford to pay the testing fee.<BR>
Second, they argue that even if the Joneses are indigent, there is no such thing as the<BR>
fundamental right to home educate children, so the state must only show that there is a rational<BR>
basis for the law, namely, the recoupment of expenses. <BR>

<P>A decision from the court is imminent since the trial is set for May 13, 1996. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>CALIFORNIA<BR>
Kennedy v. Aluzri, et al.  This civil rights lawsuit stems from the warrantless entry into the<BR>
home of Robert and Maria Kennedy for inspection of the house, and interrogation and physical<BR>
examination of the children. The Kennedys would later learn that this unlawful conduct was<BR>
precipitated by an anonymous caller reporting that Mrs. Kennedy left her children in the<BR>
backyard unsupervised.<BR>

<P>The Los Angeles County Department of Social Services filed a motion to dismiss the complaint<BR>
on the ground that their social worker is entitled to immunity from such claims. HSLDA<BR>
responded to the motion by arguing that the defendant is entitled to assert only qualified<BR>
immunity, which does not protect a government official from claims for violation of clearly<BR>
established law. We assert that the law governing these circumstances is clear, that absent an<BR>
exigent circumstance, the Fourth Amendment demands a search warrant prior to the invasion<BR>
of a private home. The parties await the courts decision.<BR>

<P>ILLINOIS<BR>
Children &amp; Family Services v. Mrs. B.  Following a hearing before an administrative law<BR>
judge in Springfield, Illinois, the finding of child abuse against Mrs. B will be expunged from<BR>
the record. The finding stemmed from a cut beneath the eye of Mrs. Bs 6-year old daughter.<BR>
The cut required stitches at the local emergency room. The incident occurred when Mrs. B was<BR>
walking into the playroom. She stepped on a bucket the children had promised to pick up. Mrs.<BR>
B picked up the bucket and threw it against the wall in anger. Mrs. B did not intend to throw<BR>
the bucket at a child, nor did she even see her children when she threw it. Nevertheless, the<BR>
bucket bounced off the wall and hit her daughter in the face, injuring the child. The judge<BR>
concluded that the injury to Mrs. Bs daughter was by accident and that Mrs. B was not guilty<BR>
of abuse, nor had she created a real and significant danger of physical injury to the child. All<BR>
findings were expunged.<BR>

<P>MARYLAND<BR>
State v. Cheryl Battles  This mother of a kindergartner with sincerely held religious beliefs<BR>
that she should teach her child at home is being criminally prosecuted for her refusal to sign the<BR>
Maryland assurance of consent home school form. According to Mrs. Battles, consenting to be<BR>
under the jurisdiction of the local school district would violate her Christian faith because the<BR>
public schools are atheistic and require education that denies the absolute truths contained in<BR>
Scripture. Mrs. Battles does not object to demonstrating that she is in compliance with the<BR>
compulsory attendance statutes requirement that she provide a regular and thorough education.<BR>
A standardized test administered to the child indicates that the her progress is considerably<BR>
advanced for her age. The trial is presently scheduled for April 9, 1996.<BR>

<P>OHIO<BR>
Children Family Services Board v. Family of V.  The Ashtabula County Juvenile Court was<BR>
the scene of one of the most bizarre hearings in which HSLDA has been involved. Fourteen-year<BR>
old and four-year old sons were removed from this members home without notice by order of<BR>
the court. HSLDA appeared on the mothers behalf two days later to persuade the court that<BR>
there was not probable cause to justify the immediate removal of these children. <BR>

<P>What made the case so odd was the fact that the individuals alleging educational neglect and<BR>
physical abuse by the mother were three older children, ages 15, 18, and 20, who had not been<BR>
in the home for more than nine months. All three of these children claimed to have been<BR>
witches, the two youngest claimed to have been sexually abused by their father and have been<BR>
in psychological counselling for several years. Now they deny their activity in the occult and<BR>
recant on their allegations against their father. Yet it is based on their testimony that the court<BR>
removed the two younger boys.<BR>

<P>Following a seven hour hearing, the court dismissed the allegations of educational neglect, but<BR>
ordered the boys to be placed into the custody of Mrs. Vs sister, an aunt with whom the boys<BR>
have a good relationship. About three weeks later, however, the boys were placed in foster care<BR>
in order to insure their continued education. The hearing on the allegations of physical abuse is<BR>
set to begin March 19, 1996. <BR>

<P>RHODE ISLAND<BR>
State v. Thomas &amp; Kathleen SanBento  These parents of a 10-year old daughter and 8-year<BR>
old son are being criminally prosecuted for failure to comply with the states compulsory<BR>
attendance statute. The truth is that the SanBentos have been educating their children since the<BR>
beginning of the 95-96 school year and requested approval from the Lincoln School Committee<BR>
in September. The SanBento curriculum was not approved by the school committee, but HSLDA<BR>
had been attempting to resolve the differences when Mr. and Mrs. SanBentos were served with<BR>
criminal summonses.<BR>

<P>In the second week of March 1996, the Lincoln School Committee approved the SanBento<BR>
curriculum. The criminal actions should now be dismissed. Nevertheless, the school<BR>
superintendent continues to insist upon the SanBento children taking the Metropolitan<BR>
Achievement Test, as well as the state mandated written evaluation assessment test each year.<BR>
We believe the requirement of both of these tests to be beyond the terms of a written agreement<BR>
between the SanBentos and the superintendent, so we are working to resolve this dispute.<BR>

Mr. and Mrs. Daniel C. v. Roarke-Ruiz, et al.  Though we previously reported that this civil<BR>
rights lawsuit against the Pittsylvania County Department of Social Services (DSS) and<BR>
Pittsylvania County court clerks had been settled, DSS refuses to participate in the settlement.<BR>
This lawsuit is the result of an effort by the DSS, with the cooperation of the domestic and<BR>
relations court clerk and intake officer, to issue bogus subpoenas to obtain the cooperation of<BR>
Mr. and Mrs. C with the departments child abuse investigation.<BR>

<P>On October 16, 1995, a uniformed officer from the sheriffs department delivered three<BR>
subpoenas to the Cs home demanding they appear with three of their children at the district<BR>
court office supervising child abuse complaints. The officer advised them that he would obtain<BR>
a warrant for their arrest if they refused to comply with the subpoenas. When we obtained a<BR>
copy of the subpoenas, we recognized that they were fraudulent because there was no underlying<BR>
court proceeding or legal authorization of any kind. A civil rights lawsuit has been filed and<BR>
settled between all defendants other than DSS. The case will now proceed against them for their<BR>
violation of procedural due process.<BR>

<B>PRESIDENTS PAGE:</B> OLD STORIES TELL THE PRICE OF FREEDOM<BR>
The Old Testament records that eventually there arose a Pharaoh who knew not Joseph. Under<BR>
the hand of this leader who did not know his nations history, the Israelites were cruelly<BR>
oppressed.<BR>

<P>In Deuteronomy 11:2-3, Moses reminded Israel that their children were not the ones who saw<BR>
and experienced the discipline of the Lord your God: His majesty, His mighty hand, His<BR>
outstretched arm; the signs He performed and the things He did in the heart of Egypt.<BR>

<P>In order that future generations would know and remember this important history, God told the<BR>
Israelites to fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your<BR>
hands and bind them on your foreheads. Teach them to your children, talking about them when<BR>
you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up<BR>
(Deut. 11:18-19).<BR>

<P>Our enemies, like Pharaoh, forget. We forget. But our children, who have never heard our<BR>
history, do not have an opportunity to remember.<BR>

<P>Two years ago, one of the most exciting victories ever experienced in the home schooling<BR>
community occurred when we saw a million telephone calls used by God to deliver us from<BR>
national teacher certification in H.R. 6. Now, in 1996, when I speak at home schooling<BR>
conventions, almost a third of those in attendance have never heard of H.R. 6. <BR>

<P>There are hundreds of thousands of home schooling parents who have no memory of the<BR>
Bismarck Tea Party in 1989. Home school leaders from 11 states flew to Bismarck to stand in<BR>
solidarity with the home schoolers there in an attempt to embarrass North Dakota into repealing<BR>
its teacher certification law. <BR>

<P>We certainly have enough fights today to keep all of us on our toes. But we cannot afford to<BR>
forget the early fights for the freedom of our home schools. We need to tell and remember the<BR>
stories, like:<BR>

<P>Eight-year-old Carey Dagley in North Dakota who was subpoenaed to testify against her<BR>
parents. She had to claim the Fifth Amendment.<BR>

<P>Robin Deigle of Ohio who was delivered from a judge who announced his intention to rule<BR>
against her before her case was ever begun.<BR>

<P>Helene Richards, the first of our Fourth Amendment heroes, who stood in her doorway and<BR>
told a social worker she couldnt enter her home unless she had a warrant.<BR>

<P>The Katy 5five families near Houston who ignited the fire for Texas home schooling<BR>
freedom by standing tall against a criminal prosecution.<BR>

<P>Yes, new home schooling parents need to know and remember these stories. But even more<BR>
important is our duty to tell the stories of freedom to our children.<BR>

<P>After two decades of political involvement, I am convinced that the best political activists are<BR>
people who have had to personally fight for their freedom. Since home schoolers have had to<BR>
engage in hand-to-hand political combat, we have become the single most effective group of pro-<BR>
family activists in the nation. <BR>

<P>Had the National Education Association had any idea of what a vibrant political force they were<BR>
helping to create, they would have done well to urge states to quickly liberalize all laws<BR>
regulating home schooling. Instead, they resisted. We won. And in the process, the NEAs<BR>
resistance helped to create Americas best grassroots lobbying team.<BR>

<P>Our children need to know these things if we want them to be freedom fighters. They need to<BR>
be involved in our battles of today. They should be writing letters to their congressmen and state<BR>
legislators. They should do these things, not only for the effect such letters have today, but also<BR>
because their personal experience in fighting for freedom will change them for a lifetime.<BR>

<P>I firmly believe that the job of this generation is to hold on to a semblance of freedomalmost<BR>
by our fingernailsuntil the army we are raising is ready to take back our nation and restore<BR>
the constitutional principles upon which we were founded.<BR>

<P>These are grand dreams and glorious possibilities, none of which will happen if we dont tell<BR>
our children and the families who are just beginning to home school about the battles and<BR>
victories of the past.<BR>

<P>Old soldiers love to tell battle stories. New soldiers need to hear them so they know the price<BR>
of freedom.<BR>

<P>	Parental Rights Drama Unfolds<BR>
	A Home Grown Case for Freedom (President's Page)<BR>

<P>	<B>Parental Rights Drama Unfolds</B><BR>

<P>	Primarily drafted by Michael Farris and Home School Legal Defense Association attorneys, the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (PRRA) was introduced on June 28, 1995, in the House and the Senate as H.R. 1946 and S. 984. The PRRA affirms the right of parents to control the upbringing and training of their childrenrights that have been eroded by conflicting state court decisions.<BR>
	Home School Legal Defense Association believes that passage of the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act will significantly increase the protection of home schooling freedoms. Too often state courts refuse to hold parental rights as fundamental. The 1993 Michigan Supreme Court's rulings in DeJonge and Bennett clearly illustrate the need for the PRRA. In DeJonge, the Court ruled that teacher certification, as applied to religiously motivated home schooling parents, was unconstitutional. But in the companion Bennett case decided the same day, the Court found that secular home schooling parents suffered no constituional violation when forced to comply with the certification requirement. The Michigan Supreme Court held that religious freedom was a fundamental right, whereas &quot;parents' rights&quot; were &quot;nonfundamental&quot; in nature.<BR>
	HSLDA staff have been working hard to promote this important legislation and secure co-sponsors in the House and Senate. The following is a summary of the key events which have taken place during the past several months.<BR>
 <BR>
October 24  Doug Phillips, Director of Federal Issues for the National Center for Home Education, led a group of Congressional Action Program (CAP) volunteers, several National Center staff members, and HSLDA's four interns to Capitol Hill to lobby for the PRRA. <BR>
	As a result, more than 20 congressmen added their names to the list of PRRA co-sponsors. <BR>

<P>October 26, Rayburn House Office Building  After months of work by legislators, home schoolers, and concerned parents, the House Sub-Committee on the Constitution heard testimony on the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act in a hearing room packed with legislative aides, media representatives, and supporters and opponents of the bill. Members of the Committee present for this first round of hearings included Congressmen Charles Canady (Chairman R-FL), Robert Goodlatte (R-VA), Bob Inglis (R-SC), Barney Frank (D-MA), Patricia Schroeder (D-CO), John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), and Melvin Watt (D-NC).<BR>
	The first panel of experts to testify included the primary congressional sponsors of the PRRARepresentatives Steve Largent (R-OK) and Mike Parker (R-MS), and Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA). Congressman Largent asserted, &quot;The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act is needed because the government is using its coercive force to dictate values, offend the religious and moral beliefs of families, and restrict the freedoms of families to live as they choose.&quot;<BR>
	A skeptical Congressman Watt challenged him, &quot;You think you can clear the fog with eight pages of legislation?&quot;<BR>
	&quot;This is not a complicated issue,&quot; Largent responded, &quot;It is just a shield for parents. This is only a legal recourse for parents to protect their rights as parents.&quot;<BR>
	Senator Grassley contended that Congress has a constitutional responsibility to pass this legislation: <BR>
It is appropriate for Congress to act within its 14th Amendment, Section 5 power to see that liberty rights are properly protected . . . The PRRA accomplishes this goal by clarifying that the proper standard to use in disputes between the government and parents is the highest legal standard available. This standard, known as the 'compelling interest standard' means that before the government can interfere in the parent-child relationship, it must demonstrate that there is a 'compelling' interest to protectnot a good or even very good interest. It must be compelling.<BR>
But Congressman Schroeder expressed concern that the PRRA may make it easer for parents to abuse their children with impunity. Representative Parker quickly responded:<BR>
My wife and I have housed over a dozen foster children in our home during our 25 years of marriage. All those children came from homes of parents who did not care for them, with many of them having their parental rights terminated. This legislation will not prohibit the social service agencies from continuing the difficult job they perform daily. Children that are being abused or neglected will hopefully be removed from their uncaring homes immediately. From a personal standpoint, I say to the critics of this bill that my family has invested too much in the protection of children to support legislation that might further harm them. This legislation offers a balance between the rights of parents and the protection of our precious children.<BR>
After the sponsors spoke, committee members heard from a second panel consisting of Vicki Rafel, National PTA Board of Directors; Greg Erken, Executive Director, Of the People; Martin Guggenheim, Professor, New York University School of Law; Colleen Pinyan, Coordinator, Office of Public Affairs, The Rutherford Institute; Marilyn Van Derbur, former Miss America; and Michael P. Farris, President, Home School Legal Defense Association.<BR>
	Not surprisingly, Rafel testified in opposition to the PRRA, stating that the PTA believes<BR>
many entities at the local, state, and federal levels have responsibilities in providing for and protecting children. These individuals and institutions are not just a part of a local community. They are also part of a total system of services and accountability that must be intertwined to provide an optimum environment for all children. Decisions affecting children should be made in a collaborative effort involving all the stakeholders, including parents, educators, health-care givers and governing bodies.<BR>
Farris sharply disagreed:<BR>
Government lawyers, government agencies, courts, and the United States military all need to know that this nation believes parents' rights are fundamental. They need to know that parents whose rights are threatened by government intrusions will receive the highest level of legal protection. They need to know that the government cannot run over those parents and decide for itself how children should be raised.<BR>
Van Derbur gave an emotional account of her abusive home, urging Congress to defeat the Act. She pleaded with committee members that someone must &quot;speak for the children . . . [the PRRA would] . . . smother their voices.&quot; Congressman Schroeder thanked Van Derbur for &quot;putting a human face on this issue.&quot;<BR>
	The third and final panel of the hearing consisted of academics George W. Dent, Professor, Case Western Reserve University School of Law; Barbara Bennett Woodhouse, Professor, University of Pennsylvania School of Law; and Wade F. Horn, Ph.D., Director, National Fatherhood Initiative.<BR>
	Committee members asked: What are reasonable corporal punishments? What about medical decisions such as blood transfusions? Should parents really be making these decisions for their children? Wouldn't this intrude on the rights of children?<BR>
	Another hot issue was federalism. Opponents of the PRRA argue that this legislation is an infringement of state's rights. Congressman Barney Frank chided conservatives, &quot;This is the most blatant augmentation of the federal government I've ever seen.&quot; <BR>
	Michael Farris responded to these concerns:<BR>
	I would like to say a final word about federalism. I am a staunch believer in the Tenth Amendment. I believe that Congress should only do those things that are explicitly authorized in the Constitution. I am not a fan of implied congressional power. But I believe that Congress has a solemn obligation to do its utmost to discharge all of its explicit constitutional duties. One of those duties, pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth Amendment, is to protect the rights of American citizens when state governments diminish or violate those rights. The right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children has been grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment for nearly seventy-five years. <BR>
	I believe that the Supreme Court was absolutely correct in saying that it was a violation of Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution for the State of Oregon to ban private education in the 1920's. I would submit that if the Supreme Court correctly discharged its duties as a branch of the federal government to protect the rights of American parents when a state went too far, this Congress has a co-equal duty to protect the constitutional liberties of American parents. State courts, state agencies, lower courts, bureaucrats, and lawyers are diminishing the rights of American parents. This bill does not create any federal programs. It does not spend a dime of taxpayer money. It does not create a single administrative position. It simply sets a legal standard. Adoption of this bill will indicate that this Congress believes that parents rights are fundamental, nothing more, nothing less.<BR>

<P>November 1  Michael Farris appeared with Congressman Largent on CNN's Burden of Proof, a program analyzing the legal aspects of current national issues and legislation. Representing the opposition was former Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders. Mike and Congressman Largent did an outstanding job refuting arguments brought against the PRRA.<BR>

<P>December 1  James Dobson interviewed Congressman Steve Largent and Senator Charles Grassley about the PRRA on the December 1 Focus on the Family radio program. Listeners were encouraged to contact their congressman and senators and urge their co-sponsorship of the PRRA.<BR>

<P>December 4  CAP volunteers visited 80 senate offices, encouraging the senators to co-sponsor the PRRA and to attend the subcommittee hearing.<BR>

<P>December 5, Dirksen Senate Office Building  The Senate held sub-committee hearings on the PRRA. The senate subcommittee members are Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA)the PRRA's key sponsor, Mike DeWine (R-OH), Hank Brown (R-CO), Strom Thurmond (R-SC), Howell Heflin (D-AL), Russell Feingold (D-WI), and Herbert Kohl (D-WI). Michael Farris, along with several other witnesses from the House hearings testified. <BR>
	Rep. Steve Largent opened as first witness on behalf of the PRRA.<BR>
	&quot;When the government becomes an obstacle or chips away at the freedoms parents rely on to raise their children, our country risks losing that fundamentally important quality that has made our country greatfreedom.  I introduced the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act to protect and support the backbone of our countryfree citizens and free parents.&quot;  <BR>
	Rep. Largent urged subcommittee members to take a realistic look at the increasing obstacles parents face today.  <BR>
	&quot;The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act is needed because the government is using its coercive force to dictate values, offend the religious and moral beliefs of families, and restrict the freedoms of families to live as they choose.&quot;<BR>
	Sen. Howell Heflin questioned the PRRA's purpose and expressed concern that it would intrude upon states' rights. &quot;If the Supreme Court has already upheld these rights, I see no need for this Act,&quot; he stated.  <BR>
	Rep. Largent responded, <BR>
&quot; [the PRRA is] consistent with the proper concept of Federalism.  While states have the general jurisdiction and authority over education, child welfare, and health care issues, the federal government has authority to protect the rights of its citizens and ensure that states employ their power in a way that respects the rights of American parents.&quot;<BR>
	Opening the second panel of witnesses, Michael Farris reminded subcommittee members that it would be impractical to ask every family to take its case to the Supreme Court. &quot;Parents' rights should be protected at the first court they go to; they should not have to go to great lengths and expense to receive a just ruling.&quot;  Farris further explained the problem with relying on lower courts without the aid of the legal standard which would be established by the PRRA:  &quot;The Supreme Court has failed to use explicit enough language and has failed to take enough parental liberty cases in the past twenty years.  Lower state and federal courts, and the countless government agencies just don't seem to understand that parental rights should be accorded this high level of protection.&quot;<BR>
	Sammy Quintana, president-elect of the National School Boards Association, claimed the PRRA is &quot;about making it more difficult for public schools to teach our children.  It is about lining the pockets of lawyers and draining the scarce educational resources in our schools.  It is about playing politics with our children.&quot;  Another anti-PRRA witness, Margaret Brinig of the University of Louisville, insisted the Act would hurt children's rights in favor of parental whims.  She claimed that the PRRA would harm the state's ability to protect children.<BR>
	Director of the National Fatherhood Initiative and child psychologist Wade Horn countered, &quot;Some see the declining well-being of children as the rationale for further state intervention in family life.  But there is very little evidence that further abdication of authority over children to the state will enhance the well-being of children.  Rather, I believe that the declining well-being of children in America is the direct result of the increasing authority the state has obtained over the rearing of children.&quot;<BR>
	Georgia lawyer Chip Angell aptly summed up the issue (and brought down the house several times) with his direct, rhetoric-demolishing testimony.  &quot;We must not deny the simple plain fact that parents can parent better than any agency or school.  Parents are tired of government intrusion.  They don't need busybodies in Washington telling them what to do.  I have seven children of my own, and I pray you'll pass this bill.&quot;<BR>

<P>ActionHome schoolers need to continue to deliver a steady stream of calls to their congressmen and senators to build support for the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act. This extremely important piece of legislation will likely pass in 1996if we keep up the momentum.<BR>
Please read the list of PRRA co-sponsors on page 23.  If your senators and representative are not co-sponsors of this legislation, please call today and ask them to take a stand for parents' rights by supporting the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995.  If your congressman or senator is a co-sponsor of the PRRA, we encourage you to send a letter of appreciation.<BR>

<P><B>A Home Grown Case for Freedom</B><BR>
by Michael Farris<BR>

<P>	Oliver North, John Poindexter, and Ronald Reagan were pillaged in the editorial pages of this nation for their allegedly unlawful activities. What were they accused of? In simple terms, they were accused of supplying military aid to the Contras in Nicaragua in violation of a congressional prohibition on such aid. They were accused of conducting foreign policy in a manner which allegedly violated an act of Congress.<BR>
	Even though the media regularly screamed about the &quot;illegality&quot; of Iran-Contra, there seemed to be extra vehemence in the press attacks because the whole affair was originally executed in secret. The press hates all secrets which do not involve them.<BR>
	Bill Clinton has shown that it is completely acceptable to conduct illegal foreign military operations so long as everything is done in the open.<BR>
	Home schooler, Specialist Michael New refused to obey an order which required him to undertake service for the United Nations on a mission into Macedonia. <BR>
	Spc. New was ordered to wear a U.N. uniform. Awaiting him in Macedonia would be a further requirement that he surrender his U.S. Army identification card to be replaced by a U.N. cardidentifying him not as an American soldier but as U.N. personnel. New was also placed under the command of a French General and an Iraqi ambassador who serve the United Nations.<BR>
	Legal research I undertook for New's lawyers demonstrates that it is clearly illegal to require any American soldier to wear U.N. insignia on a U.S. military uniform (transforming it into what the military calls the U.N. uniform). Foreign insignia are strictly prohibited on U.S. military uniforms unless specifically authorized by Congress. And, needless to say, Congress has never dared to cross the American public by ordering U.S. soldiers to wear U.N. uniforms.<BR>
	But not only is it illegal to require U.S. soldiers to wear the U.N. uniform, it is clearly illegal for Clinton to send American troops to serve in a U.N. military action.<BR>
	Clinton and the U.N. claim to be operating under the U.N. Charter which the United States ratified in 1945. Chapter VII, Article 43 of the U.N. Charter authorizes the use of armed forces on loan from willing member-nations &quot;for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.&quot; There is an important restriction on this use of armed forces by the U.N. which is spelled out in both the U.N. charter and U.S. law.  The U.N. Charter calls for &quot;special agreement or agreements&quot; to be negotiated by the member-nations to specify the numbers, types of forces, their degree of readiness, and the nature of the military assistance to be provided.<BR>
	The United States Congress passed a law in 1949 to implement America's participation in the U.N. This act, 22 U.S.C.  287d, requires the President to negotiate such &quot;special agreements&quot; before sending any U.S. military personnel into the service of the United Nations under Article 43. Importantly, the law requires that such agreements must be ratified by Congress.<BR>
	Has this been done? Well don't take my word for it. Read the testimony of Conrad K. Harper, Legal Advisor, Department of State, given in Congress on March 4, 1994. <BR>
	With respect to U.S. law, the President has both statutory and constitutional authority to enable the United States to participate in and support U.N. peace operations. In particular under Section 6 of the United Nations Participation Act [22 U.S.C.  287d], the President is authorized to negotiate special agreements with the U.N. Security Council, thereby making units of the U.S. Armed Forces available to the Council on its call pursuant to Article 43 [Chapter VII] of the UN Charter. Such agreements are subject to the approval of Congress, but further Congressional authorization would not be required for the President to make forces available pursuant to such an agreement in a particular case. In practice, of course, no action had ever been taken under Section 6 of the Act because no agreements have ever been concluded under Article 43. <BR>
	The United Nations has passed a number of resolutions calling for the use of military forces in Macedonia. Every resolution references Chapter VII, Article 43 as the source for its authority.<BR>
	In other words, it is completely illegal for Bill Clinton or any other U.S. president to send American troops into a war zone under the command or auspices of the United Nations because Congress has never ratified any Article 43 special agreements to specify the terms and conditions of U.S. military actions with the United Nations.<BR>
	An election year is coming and it is reasonable to suppose that Bill Clinton realizes that a popular military action will result in greater popularity. Apparently, this is an old political ploy, because the founding fathers took the trouble to build a constitutional barrier to this kind of grandstanding.<BR>
	James Madison wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson on April 2, 1798, which proclaimed, &quot;The Constitution supposes, what the history of all governments demonstrates, that the executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war in the legislature.&quot;<BR>
	Clinton's incursion into Macedonia, and the related even larger deployment to Bosnia, may or may not be in the best interest of the United States. The same, however, could have been said about the sale of military weapons to Iran and the diversion of profits therefrom to supply the Contras in Nicaragua.<BR>
	Back then we were repeatedly told, &quot;it is not a question of policy, it is a question of legality.&quot; <BR>
	Where are these voices today? Clinton's military exercise to Macedonia is debatable on policy grounds. But it is clearly illegal. <BR>
	If Clinton's policy is good policy, let him negotiate the special agreement and bring it to Congress for ratification. Since he has not done so, he is without lawful authority to send America's bravest men and women into harms way to die in U.N. uniforms carrying U.N. identity cards.<BR>
	Perhaps it's time for yet another special prosecutor.<BR>
	Home schoolers are appropriately wary of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. We know that U.N. control over American policy threatens our freedoms to educate and raise our children. We have fought hard for the sovereignty of our families and our nation.<BR>
	We can be proud that the young American who has the moral courage to call the President to account for his violation of the law is from our own ranks. Freedom is not store-bought. It is grown at home.

Cathy Gilstrap and Steve McGarvey present . . .<BR>
A Week in the Life of HSLDA<BR>
The four-day work log for Scott Somerville and his two legal assistants, Cathy Gilstrap and Steve McGarvey, was originally 30 pages long. Obviously it was impossible to include every activity in this report. We have, therefore, selected highlights of their week's activities, and we hope this &quot;brief&quot; account will give you a glimpse of HSLDA in action during our busiest time of year.<BR>

<P><B>Monday, September 4</B><BR>
Labor dayfederal holiday. HSLDA is closed.<BR>

<P><B>Tuesday, September 5</B><BR>
8:30 a.m. Scott, Cathy, and Steve join other members of the HSLDA staff in the legal library for a time of prayer. Every Tuesday and Thursday morning, HSLDA sets aside a half hour to pray for members, organizational needs, and pressing state and federal issues.<BR>
8:52 a.m. Prayer meeting is over and the HSLDA staff prepare to meet their work week. Voice mail messages have accumulated over the long weekend. Both Steve and Cathy retrieve their messages. Steve begins returning phone calls. Cathy prints out the dictated correspondence she typed over the weekend for Scott's signature. <BR>
9:10 a.m. Scott breaks away from discussion with fellow attorneys. Arriving in his office, he switches on his computer, checks e-mail messages, and plays back his voice-mail messages. Calls Pat, a single mother in Florida who is trying to home school despite problems from welfare, social workers, and an ex-husband who is in prison.<BR>
9:13 a.m. Steve's phone rings. It is a member who permanently resides in Oklahoma, but is temporarily living in Kansas dealing with family matters after her father's death. Does she have to comply with Kansas law? She is also concerned about the possibility of family members turning her in to social services. Steve transfers the call to Scott.<BR>
9:15 a.m. Scott picks up the transferred call. Oklahoma law is much better than Kansas, so it will be better if she can stick with Oklahoma law. Scott suggests she not contact any Kansas officials until she gets within 186 days of the end of the school year. If she is still in Kansas then, she should register her school with the Kansas Department of Education.<BR>
	Scott spends the rest of his morning answering questions from members:<BR>
	A Rhode Island member calls. She has been told she &quot;must register&quot; her five-year-old with the school district, even though the child doesn't reach compulsory attendance age until next year. Scott tells her this is nonsense. &quot;Tell your school official you have spoken to your attorney, and that you are not required to register this child at this time,&quot; he says, &quot;if they give you any trouble, tell them to talk to your attorney, Scott Somerville, at our phone number. That usually does it.&quot;<BR>
&quot;This is outrageous!&quot; A member from Virginia calls and explains that she is in a battle over custody for her two sons from a previous marriage. On the day she was in the hospital delivering twins, her ex-husband went to court, claiming that home schooling is illegal. The mother's divorce attorney didn't know what to do and the judge took the two boys and put them in temporary custody of the father. (Later, Scott makes several calls and writes several lettersincluding a letter to the Virginia Attorney Generalto try to help this family.)<BR>
9:30 a.m. Correspondence completed, Cathy begins returning phone calls. She starts with several left over from last Friday afternoon. During the time she is on the phone, ten new messages are left in her voice mail.<BR>
9:54 a.m. Steve answers his phone. A member from Illinois needs the Illinois sample letter. Her school district is demanding that the family fill out a notification form and submit grades for their children every semester. Neither of these regulatory measures are required by Illinois law. Steve sent her the sample letter to send the district instead of the form. He told her that if the school district continued to insist on the notification form, to call us and Scott will respond on her behalf.<BR>
12:00 p.m. A lull in the constant stream of telephone calls allows Scott to execute a quick exit from his office. Crossing to the opposite office suite, he enters the legal library. Four people wait for him  it's time for Logic at Lunch. (Scott teaches logic twice a week to any interested HSLDA staff and interns. A local 13-year-old home school student also attends.)<BR>
In the meantime, Cathy watches (and applauds) as Chuck Hurst, HSLDA's Office Manager, removes the &quot;old, yucky copier.&quot; Mechanical unreliability andin spite of frequent visits from the repair manconsistently bad copies, have caused Cathy, Steve, and Scott to spend a lot of time at the copier upstairs. A replacement should arrive this afternoon.<BR>
 1:00 p.m. Logic is over. Scott returns to his office and calls a family in Virginia who is having a custody battlethe biological father is trying to take the children away from the home schooling mom.<BR>
1:30 p.m. Cathy is back from lunch and, in between the steady stream of incoming calls, works on returning call messages left on voice mail. Telephone calls fill her afternoon. <BR>
A member in Virginia calls. The mother just got married, and the father of her child is suing for custody (they never were married). The new husband wants some counsel. A hearing is set for the 11th, and the family plans to represent itself. Cathy passes the message on to Scott. <BR>
Several people call, concerned that their school systems haven't responded to their home school notices. Cathy tells them that as long as the school hasn't written back to say they can't home school, they shouldn't worry about it; the schools are very busy getting started with the public school students. The families will hear back soon enough, but they don't have to wait to hear back before starting their home school programs.<BR>
2:49 p.m. Steve answers his telephone. A lady from Texas wants to know if she has to fill out the forms her school district sent her and if, by filling out the forms, she is giving up her rights to keep the truant officer out of her home. Steve advises her that she is not required by state law to fill out the school district's home school notification form, nor is she required to allow a truant officer into her home. &quot;If a truant officer comes, call us immediately.&quot;<BR>
3:19 p.m. Steve begins transcribing an Illinois Court Report article that Scott dictated.<BR>
3:21 p.m. Scott calls an attorney in West Virginia who represents a child with special needs and is appealing a special education case to the 4th circuit. The family took the child out of a public school and home schooled him. The attorney is trying to figure out how this will affect the federal case.<BR>
3:58 p.m. David Gilstrap delivers the day's mail. Normally, HSLDA's daily mail is sorted and delivered by 11:30 a.m. However, the combination of yesterday's federal holiday and the beginning of the school year resulted in a mountain of mail.<BR>
4:00 p.m. Cathy decides to give the new copier a test drive. Unfortunately, it jams (the &quot;duplex&quot; isn't working), so she makes the familiar trek upstairs. She manages to get the copying done and all the envelopes stuffed so the letters can all go out in the afternoon mail.<BR>
4:01 p.m. Scott sees the pile of mail David has delivered. The busyness of the day is beginning to show. Scott can't even keep up with the    e-mail, much less the surface mail. <BR>
4:08 p.m. Scott works through the mail. He finds a wonderful letter of thanks from a family in Virginia and a card from a family in Texas. &quot;This almost makes going through the mail worthwhile,&quot; he muses.<BR>
4:12 p.m. Scott opens the next piece of mail and finds a letter praising the Lord because, after a full year of legal maneuverings, one Iowa family's special program for their 15-year-old with Down's Syndrome has been approved by the required authorities. Scott takes a minute to call and congratulate the family for this good news. <BR>
4:18 p.m. Scott is still going through his mail. He reads a letter from a school district in Rhode Island which has a blatantly unconstitutional policy. They say, &quot;We have not revised our policy. We will not approve any home school requests if our policy is not followed. We are referring this matter to our attorney.&quot;<BR>
4:25 p.m. Scott completes a letter to the Rhode Island school district attorney regarding their unconstitutional policy.<BR>
4:29 p.m. Scott opens a letter from a Texas family. Their school district issued them a ridiculous 5-page form to complete and return. Scott fills out the form, marking 9/10ths of it &quot;not applicable.&quot;<BR>
4:43 p.m. Scott is still going through the morning's mail. He sighs as he reads a letter from Frederick County, Virginia, public schools. HSLDA has had six different battles going on with this one county. Scott directs Cathy to instruct our member family on how to respond.<BR>
5:03 p.m. Scott is down to the last piece of mail. That's it for Tuesday, September 5!<BR>

<P><B>Wednesday, September 6</B><BR>
7:45 a.m. Cathy arrives early in an attempt to get a head start on the day. She begins by gathering up some studies and other materials to send to a member in Rhode Island who's going to be making a presentation at the end of the month to her school committee.<BR>
8:27 a.m. Steve arrives at work.<BR>
8:30 a.m. Cathy walks next door to the Membership Department to pick up labels she printed for all the members in Duval County, Florida. She is preparing to send them a copy of the letter Scott wrote to their superintendent. Erin Smith, one of HSLDA's receptionists, hands her a note with the phone number of a new Massachusetts member who has a meeting with her superintendent this morning. Cathy returns to her desk immediately and calls the woman back. She advises her on what the officials do and do not have a right to ask her about. The member seems a lot less nervous by the time Cathy finishes the call.<BR>
	9:00 a.m. Cathy calls the copier repair company and they promise to come and fix the machine. Now it's on to mail.<BR>
9:00 a.m. Scott is processing mail. A letter notifies him of a religious exemption hearing half way across Virginia. Why is this such a big state? But there is good news, too: a news report indicates that an Illinois school district is creating a positive home school policy.<BR>
9:30 a.m. Scott calls an attorney in Massachusetts to resolve outstanding details on a black single mother who was prosecuted for taking her children out of the public school. (Conflict with school officials began when the mother refused to send her daughter, who was becoming suicidal, back to public school.) This mother faced three different legal charges, plus a child neglect charge when she asked Massachusetts home schoolers for help. With HSLDA's help, she decided to start home schooling.<BR>
9:50 a.m. Cathy listens to her voice mail. One message is from a West Virginia member who says she has a school official at her door! Scott is on another call, so Cathy calls her right back. The situation has already been dealt with and the mother is relieved. David Gordon, HSLDA's litigation attorney, was able to take her call and the officials had already left. The mother indicates that they have neighbors who are nosey about their children occasionally being outside during school hours. She thinks the officials might come back. Cathy tells her that any time there is an official at the door or it is an emergency situation to tell the receptionist so she won't get transferred into voice mail.<BR>
9:53 a.m. Scott assigns Thad Cardine the task of researching and writing an article for the Court Report on the current status of Florida home schoolers participating in public school sports. <BR>
9:54 a.m. Scott calls the Massachusetts attorney about the black single mother situation.<BR>
10:10 a.m. Steve prepares for his trip to the Oregon Home School Conference in Portland. He will be working the HSLDA table. He runs various errands, picking up petty cash, confirming materials sent, verifying Mike Farris' schedule, etc. . . .<BR>
10:20 a.m. Cathy calls one of our members in Prince William County who will be required to appear at a religious exemption hearing at the end of the month. She just wants to touch base with the family and make sure they are prepared. They should be getting a letter from the school district soon.<BR>
10:55 a.m. Scott has a very unpleasant conversation with a school board attorney regarding a mother whose two sons were taken away by a family court judge. After completing the call, Scott sets up meeting with David Gordon, HSLDA's litigation attorney, to discuss the matter.<BR>
11:11 a.m. Steve takes a call from a lady in New Hampshire who asks if she can home school someone else's child for a short amount of time. He tells her it is fine as long as she notifies the person to whom she sent her notice of intent. In New Hampshire, notification can be made to either the school district superintendent, the private school principal, or the commissioner of education.<BR>
11:26 a.m. Scott meets with David Gordon to have an extended discussion regarding the case in which the mother's two sons were taken away by a family court judge.<BR>
12:26 p.m. Scott spends quite a while counseling a Massachusetts mother who is deeply concerned because she was told by her principal that her children had to be on the school bus tomorrow. Scott says, &quot;This happens thirty or forty times every year. You do what is best for your child, and I'll deal with the school district.&quot;<BR>
12:36 p.m. Scott calls a home schooling mother in Massachusetts whose school district has an absolutely insane policy. The district's policy dates back almost 14 yearslong before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that home schooling is constitutionally protected. Scott assigns himself the task of writing a &quot;squawk&quot; letter to let the district know that their policy exceeds the law. (Scott and Cathy have a whole drawer full of &quot;squawk&quot; letters.)<BR>
1:04 p.m. Scott is back from lunch and checking the messages that have accrued while he was away from his desk.<BR>
1:08 p.m. Scott finds good news! Iowa now permits substitute teachers to supervise home school programs. Requirements for home school supervisors has been a gray area in Iowa law since the statute was passed in 1991, but it looks like the department of education is on our side on this one. This is great for Iowa families who want to work with a teacher they know and trust, rather than an unknown, full-time state employee.<BR>
1:10 p.m. Scott gets a call from Prince William County saying the hearings are confirmed for Wednesday, September 27th. <BR>
1:15 p.m. Steve receives a fax from a Texas member in the Early Independent School District (ISD). The fax explains that the principal of the local primary school is trying to require home schoolers to submit their curriculum for approval.<BR>
1:16 p.m. Cathy receives an e-mail from Scott asking her to arrange for a court reporter for the hearing.<BR>
1:32 p.m. Scott calls a principal in Rhode Island about a family who is trying to get started legally there.<BR>
1:34 p.m. Scott is dealing with the Granite School District in Utah that has been very difficult to deal with. The Granite district is in the Salt Lake City area, and they use form letters to try to process hundreds of home schoolers each year. Home schoolers don't like to be &quot;processed.&quot;<BR>
2:00 p.m. Cathy answers a call from a Utah member who says they have moved to a new school district. Last year HSLDA wrote to their old school district. The father tells her, &quot;This new one is even worse.&quot; He faxes us the district's forms and other materials and asks for our opinion. <BR>
Cathy calls him back and tells him that they don't need to use the school's forms; they can just write a letter. She assures him that Scott will write a letter to the district and that we'll fax him a copy of the letter and a sample letter for his use in responding to the district. <BR>
2:10 p.m. Scott types a letter to the Utah school district protesting its illegal policy. Home schoolers in Utah are not required to use the school district's &quot;permission&quot; forms. Scott spells out what districts can and cannot do in Utah.<BR>
A Rhode Island mother calls about the difficult situation in her district. Rhode Island, like Utah, insists on &quot;approving&quot; home school programs. This Rhode Island district demands a whole laundry list of promises and evidence before they will &quot;approve&quot; a family.<BR>
2:45 p.m. Scott concludes a long conversation with the political operator for the Accelerated Christian Education schools who alerted us to the Maxwell v. TEA case in Texas. In this public school case, the Texas Attorney General filed a brief which argues that &quot;parents do not have fundamental rights.&quot; Texas home schoolers go ballistic over this!<BR>
2:51 p.m. Scott contacts a truant officer in Frederick County, Virginia about a family claiming religious exemption. Next he calls another official about the same issue.<BR>
3:18 p.m. Scott prints out the letter to Utah's Granite School District.<BR>
3:20 p.m. Scott formulates a letter to the Early ISD (Texas) advising the school officials that there is no provision in Texas law which allows them to review home schoolers' curriculum. <BR>
3:23 p.m. Scott answers questions from a member about home schooling children who are not immediate family members (i.e. nephews, grandchildren, etc.) in Massachusetts.<BR>
3:30 p.m. Cathy receives a call from a member in Frederick County, Virginia, who says that a school official (truant officer from the high school) called her husband at work to find out where their children are. They are applying for religious exemption, but the husband just told the person that they're planning to home school. Cathy tells her we will call the school official back to tell them the family is applying for religious exemption and to see if there are any problems. <BR>
3:35 p.m. Scott gives Steve the Early ISD letter. It is to be sent to the school principal and the superintendent. Steve is also to send copies to each HSLDA member in the Early district.<BR>
3:45 a.m. The mother in Frederick County, Virginia, calls back. The truant officer called her husband again and this time he told the officer to call HSLDA. <BR>
3:51 p.m. Scott takes a call from a Frederick County school official regarding religious exemptions. School officials there have been systematically harassing home schoolers all fall. More and more members want to opt out of this nasty situation through the religious exemption law. This would end any on-going contact with the school.<BR>
        3:52 p.m. Steve runs a query on HSLDA's membership database to determine the number of members in the Early ISD. He prints address labels and prepares the mailing.<BR>
        4:20 p.m. Steve talks to a woman in Pennsylvania who is moving to New Hampshire. She asks what New Hampshire law is like and if she needs to notify the Pennsylvania school district that they are moving. Steve answers her questions and says he will send her a copy of the New Hampshire home schooling statute summary. He transfers her to Dana Sweeney, the legal assistant for Pennsylvania, for an answer to her question about notifying her school district of her impending move.<BR>
5:02 p.m. Scott talks to a Rhode Island principal about a family. He explains that Rhode Island law is very limited as applied to families with sincere religious objections to public school approval. The principal agrees to back off on several of his demands.<BR>
5:10 p.m. Cathy works until 6:00 p.m. making phone calls. She just can't seem to break away! One of the families needs a special-ed attorney referral for Massachusetts. She sends Scott an e-mail note about this.<BR>

<P><B>Thursday, September 7</B><BR>
7:00 a.m. Steve takes an early flight out of Dulles on his way to Portland, Oregon, where he will work the HSLDA table at the home school conference.<BR>
8:10 a.m. Cathy arrives at work. She begins the day by mailing information on the Virginia law to a Michigan member who is considering moving.<BR>
8:30 a.m. Cathy goes to HSLDA staff prayer meeting in the legal library.<BR>
8:30 a.m. Scott arrives for morning prayer. Today we pray for the work loadit's always very intense at the beginning of the school year, the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, and a number of other issues.<BR>
9:00 a.m. Cathy listens to her voice mail messages. <BR>
9:15 a.m. Scott flips on his computer. By some miracle he hasn't received any voice mail messages yet, but two e-mail messages are already waiting for him.<BR>
9:15 a.m. Cathy returns a call from a family in Worcester, Massachusetts. The school psychologist had called the family to set up an appointment to come by their house with their &quot;school adjustment counselor&quot; with a form for the mother to sign. The psychologist and adjustment counselor had wanted to come by that day, but the mother explained that she is busy, and they agree to an appointment next week. Cathy tells the mother that she should offer to go to their office to sign the form rather than have them come to her home. If she has any questions about the form, she can explain that &quot;her lawyer needs to review it first.&quot;<BR>
9:23 a.m. Scott begins a letter to a member family in Rhode Island.<BR>
9:35 a.m. Cathy returns the call of a member in Florida who is enrolled in an umbrella school requiring physical examinations of their children. The law says that any child enrolled in a public or private school is required to have a physical examination, but that &quot;any child shall be exempt from the requirement of a health examination upon written request of the parent or guardian of such child stating objections to such examination on religious grounds.&quot; Cathy tells her to just write a letter and give it to the school for their files.<BR>
9:58 a.m. Scott answers a telephone call from a member family in Tennessee who is still trying to get the first ever exemption to the home school bachelor's degree requirement granted.<BR>
10:19 a.m. Scott takes a call from an Illinois member. Her abusive husband is divorcing her and, after five years of successful home schooling, is trying to attack the home school and take custody of the children. Scott outlines the basic defense for home school custody cases and promises to help bring her divorce lawyer up to speed on home schooling.<BR>
10:39 a.m. Scott calls Pat Farrenga of Holt Associates in Boston to ask for help finding expert witnesses for an un-schooling family who is being rejected by their school district.<BR>
10:47 a.m. Scott calls the un-schooling family in Massachusetts to check on their status. Massachusetts school districts have real trouble &quot;approving&quot; families who have no formal schedule or structure for their program. This family was approved last year by a very understanding assistant superintendentbut he has since moved to Vermont.<BR>
11:00 a.m. Cathy is listening to more voice mail messages when Cynthia Clapp, a membership coordinator, stops by. Cynthia wants to talk to Scott about the Virginia law's five-year-old exemption and about permissible work hours for 17-year-olds, but Mike Farris is in Scott's office. <BR>
11:21 a.m. Scott talks to Doug Phillips about an attorney who is an expert on child abuse cases. Doug needs to know whether he is a good resource.<BR>
11:29 a.m. Scott takes a call from an Indiana family member. The local school district has forced the family into a due process hearing. We're going to have to sue this district.<BR>
11:45 a.m. Cathy is paged to pick up a call. It is a member family in Virginia who was visited by social services. They were reported for physical abuse of their children. The mother is calling from a pay phone. Cathy transfers the call to Scott.<BR>
11:46 a.m. Scott answers the phone, and advises the mother on how to handle a social worker contact. (Editor's note: several weeks later, HSLDA files a federal civil rights lawsuit against the social worker in this case.)<BR>
11:55 a.m. Cathy answers a call from Cynthia who had just taken a call from a non-member. The non-member pulled her child out of school last spring, but didn't do anything else to comply with the Virginia home school law. Whenever the school called, she would just tell them that she was home schooling under a religious exemption. When the school told her that she had to apply for the exemption, she refused to do so. <BR>
Now that another school year has begun, the school district is calling and insisting that she apply for a religious exemption by tomorrow, or her child will have to go back to school. The mother says she just found out yesterday that she was supposed to write a letter requesting a religious exemption. Cynthia told the mother that she should tell the school district that she'll mail them a letter. Cathy told Cynthia that was fine. The mother is express-mailing her membership application. <BR>
12:05 p.m. Cathy hears a desperate page over the intercom. A member in Ohio was reported to social services by a neighbor and needed to speak to someone. Scott is on the telephone. Cathy picks up the call, and, realizing it's the lunch hour, scrambles to find an attorney. Christopher Klicka takes the call.<BR>
12:10 p.m. Scott hangs up the phone. He has been talking to a Virginia home schooling mother who has been visited by social workers claiming educational neglect and physical abuse. The social worker, frustrated by the family's refusal to waive their constitutional rights, goes off to find some other way to get to the children.<BR>
1:29 p.m. Scott gets off the phone with a welfare worker who says our home schooling mother has to make $7.50 more per week or else her food stamps will be cut.<BR>
1:43 p.m. Scott receives a letter from a Massachusetts school district attorney dismissing child neglect charges against our black single mother.<BR>
3:18 p.m. Scott speaks to the Massachusetts un-schooling mother about the program approval process.<BR>
3:20 p.m. Cathy receives an   e-mail from Scott which contains the name of a special education attorney in Massachusetts. She calls the member who requested the information.<BR>
4:32 p.m. Scott talks to the Assistant Superintendent of Massachusetts regarding the un-schooling situation. The child has special needs.<BR>
4:45 p.m. Scott talks with the Virginia home schooling mother who is on welfare. She has managed to get extra hours from her employer. She called her case worker who said, &quot;That should do it. Get it in writing, and we won't cut your food stamps.&quot;<BR>
4:51 p.m. Scott calls the family in Indiana. He also calls CPS and the police officers. He leaves messages. The police station is radioing the police officer so he can get back to Scott about this child protective service issue.<BR>
5:13 p.m. Scott speaks to a local support group leader in Kansas. Their district is coming up with a new truancy policy. Scott outlines what that policy should include.<BR>
5:00  6:00 p.m. Cathy stays late to catch up on her telephone calls.<BR>

<P><B>Friday, September 8th</B><BR>
8:15 a.m. Cathy logs into her computer.<BR>
8:20 a.m. Cathy finds a voice mail message forwarded to her by the HSLDA receptionist from a Canadian member who is interested in the laws of South Dakota. Cathy records the message with a note to call later this morning (if she calls now it will only be 6:20 a.m. Alberta time). <BR>
8:22 a.m. Scott walks in the door. Stops to look at the Washington Post story on Senator Packwood's resignation. He notices Steve McGarvey's dark office and remembers that he is at the Oregon conference. This isn't a pretty time for him to be elsewherewe had 32 calls yesterday, and altogether too many of them were from social workers.<BR>
      8:25 a.m. Cathy prints out the religious exemption letters she typed last night and places them on Scott's desk for his signature. Of course, he's already on the telephone.<BR>
      8:40 a.m. Cathy makes a quick trip to the mailroom. As she walks by the receptionist desk she hears Son-Mi being paged for a call. Since Son-Mi isn't in yet, Cathy takes the call. It is a non-member from New Hampshire who is having problems with her school district. Cathy offers some suggestions and puts a membership application in the mail for her.<BR>
8:56 a.m. Scott processes e-mail and voice mail messages. <BR>
9:25 a.m. Scott discovers that the batteries in his microcassette have gone dead. All the entries he so diligently spoke into the microphone this morning weren't recorded. He calls Cathy on the intercom and asks her to find him some new batteries.<BR>
9:30 a.m. Cathy answers a call from Lisa, one of HSLDA's receptionists. The Rhode Island family with custody problems needs to talk to someone right away. The school board can't approve their program because the ex-wife has issued a restraining order, preventing the family from home schooling. Cathy transfers the call to Scott.<BR>
9:46 a.m. Scott installs new batteries in his microcassette recorder and recaps the entries he thought he'd already made that morning . . . <BR>
He spoke with a family who got a letter from CPS in Indiana yesterday outlining how to defend themselves if investigated by social workers. <BR>
9:53 a.m. Scott dictates a letter closing the Massachusetts case where the school district prosecuted a black single mother.<BR>
10:00 a.m. Cathy begins returning telephone calls. <BR>
She reads an e-mail note from Linda. A new member family in Florida says their doctor has informed them he will have to report the family because they don't have paperwork filed for their religious exemption to immunizations. (The family had written a letter for the umbrella school's file.) Cathy calls the mother and tells her that she will send her the required formthe family and the doctor will have to sign it and it will have to be placed on file at the umbrella school where the family is enrolled.<BR>
10:04 a.m. Scott dictates a letter to a Massachusetts superintendent who has suddenly changed the rules for home schoolers in his district.<BR>
10:34 a.m. Scott writes a letter to the Providence, Rhode Island, school district, explaining that their rigid policy must be changed to accommodate sincere religious objections.<BR>
10:55 a.m. Scott completes a telephone call with a Rhode Island father whose ex-wife has filed a restraining order preventing his school district from approving his home school program.<BR>
11:01 a.m. Scott dictates a fire-breathing letter to the superintendent of Middleboro, Massachusetts, who won't approve home schoolers unless they establish a predetermined time for their child to be involved with educational time activities, allow on-site visits by school officials, allow testing by school officials, provide documentation that the &quot;educational rights of the child have been properly and appropriately maintained,&quot; cooperate &quot;fully with the school department in all matters related to the education of the child,&quot; and &quot;provide to the satisfaction of the school department a wholesome and stimulating environment which promotes the intellectual, emotional, and physical development of the child.&quot; <BR>
11:13 a.m. Scott dictates a letter to an attorney for the really obnoxious school district in Williamsburg, Virginia. This district had refused to &quot;acknowledge&quot; the home school program for a single mother unless the father agreed. The father used this fact to gain custody of the children.<BR>
11:32 a.m. Scott speaks to the Massachusetts attorney about the black single mother case.<BR>
11:35 a.m. Scott suddenly lifts up his eyes and sees a mountain of incoming mail. &quot;Oh help!&quot;<BR>
12:02 p.m. Scott hangs up the phone. He has been talking to an Indiana Child Protection Service worker, and then with the family in this case. CPS received a report that the child may be a victim. But after Scott grilled the social worker, she said, &quot;Well, the parents are not the ones who are suspected to have done anything.&quot; <BR>
Scott called the parents and advised the family to meet with the CPS worker at her office to discuss what is alleged to have happened to their child. They were very glad to hear that they were not the suspects, but obviously disturbed to hear that their child had been reported to be a victim. The parents closed the conversation by thanking Scott over and over again for what he'd done in this case and saying, &quot;Our membership fee has been earned many, many times over just in the last couple of days here.&quot;<BR>
12:21 p.m. Scott receives a call from the education secretary in the Oklahoma governor's office. She is asking for our comments on an Oklahoma school district which is trying to unlawfully regulate home schoolers.<BR>
12:42 p.m. Scott hangs up the telephone. He has just finished speaking with the Oklahoma governor's educational policy advisor. This lady ran for state superintendent of education and lost by 1/3 of 1% of the vote. The governor then nominated her to be secretary of education, and the Democrats, on a straight party line and very public vote, rejected her. She is now the educational policy advisor for the governor, and she is just a fabulous person.<BR>
1:31 p.m. Scott completes a call with Oklahoma home school leaders. A year ago, the Oklahoma Department of Education &quot;floated&quot; a new policy, but it was soundly rejected by state officials. Unfortunately, the department never bothered to tell the school districts that the policy was not to be used, and it has resurfaced. Scott and the Oklahoma home school leaders discussed strategy for dealing with this situation.<BR>
2:07 p.m. Scott talks to the Massachusetts un-schooler who is trying very hard to get a home school program approved. The school officials just can't handle the un-schooling philosophy. (Editor's note: Several weeks later, after many telephone calls, this family was finally approved.)<BR>
2:33 p.m. Scott talks to a Massachusetts state leader on the phone. School districts all over the state are harassing home schoolers. Scott encourages the leaders to meet with local support groups to fight bad policies.<BR>
2:59 p.m. Scott goes over Florida sports story assignment with Thad Cardine, one of HSLDA's interns.<BR>
3:15 p.m. Scott skims through pleadings in a federal suit brought by a non-member.<BR>
3:23 p.m. Scott is still processing the day's mail.<BR>
3:42 p.m. Scott calls school officials in Massachusetts about nasty threatening letters to our member family.<BR>
4:40 p.m. Cathy calls a family in South Dakota who is wondering if it's okay to have their teenaged daughters occasionally babysit during school hours. There is no legal reason why this should be a problem, but Cathy suggests that if possible, it might be better for the children to come to the teenager's home for babysitting during school hours. If that is not an option, Cathy stresses making sure that the teen knows the proper procedures for handling people at the door or answering the phone.<BR>
4:40 p.m. Scott returns the call of a non-member mother in a desperate condition in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her children are probably going to be taken away from her unless she gets them into a private school immediately. <BR>
5:00 p.m. Scott completes the phone call with the desperate single mother in Milwaukee. She is a Black Muslim, so Scott assists her in locating a private Muslim school that may be able to help her.<BR>
5:08 p.m. Scott talks to another Massachusetts family who is being driven &quot;up their tree&quot; by obnoxious and ignorant superintendents.<BR>
5:30 p.m. Cathy listens to a message from a new member in Uxbridge, Massachusetts. The Uxbridge school district has implemented a new policy which allows home schoolers to receive vouchers for their programs, but now it's official that there are strings attached: the families must agree to home visits, they have to use the school district's tests, etc., and it looks like the home schoolers are going to be required to follow OBE guidelines. This is not good. Cathy calls her back and talks to her about it. She also copies the mother's message over to Scott because she thinks he'll be interested in hearing all this.<BR>
5:50 p.m. Cathy logs out of her computer and turns off the light. Another week at HSLDA is over.Across the States<BR>

<P><B>California</B><BR>
<i>Still a State of Confusion for Home Schoolers</i><BR>

<P>In the golden state, an onslaught of misinformation and misinterpretation regarding home schooling again accompanies the beginning of school.  The following items are representative of the kind of misinformation communicated to home school families in California:<BR>
	1. San Diego City Schools informed home school families a $25 fee would have to accompany the private school affidavit in order for it to be accepted for the 1995-96 school year.  Additionally, it was suggested that the administrator of the private/home school provide attendance records, teacher qualifications, and course of study for review by public school officials.<BR>
	2. Los Angeles continues to assert, as it has in past years, that home school families are required to pay a $25 processing fee for filing the private school affidavit.<BR>
	3. Accompanying affidavits received by home schoolers in Fontana, California, was a letter indicating that the administrators of the private school should provide the school's attendance journal, the qualifications of the teachers teaching in the private school, and the courses of study which would be offered.<BR>
	4. San Francisco City Schools informed a home school mother that since she was not a certified teacher, she was not entitled to receive an affidavit.  After the family read information from the CHEA Introduction to Home Schooling Manual, they decided they would have the father go down to see if he could obtain the affidavit.  Along with CHEA, we have discovered that social workers, police officers, and school officials treat mothers differently than they do fathers.  Sure enough, when the father politely but forcefully demanded the affidavit, the school officials handed it over.<BR>
	5. It is almost universal now in every county that sends out a packet of information accompanying the private school affidavit, that there will be a letter outlining the State Department of Education's position that home schooling is only legal under the tutorial provision in California, found in Education Code  48224.<BR>
	It bears repeating that home education in California is accomplished under the private school provision of the Education Code.  California is not unique in this respect.  Eleven other states recognize home education under private school provisions.  However, not everyone in Californiaespecially the state department of educationagrees that home schooling can be accomplished under the private school exemption.  It is important to understand that the state department of education does not have any legal jurisdiction to determine which children are exempt from public school attendance.  All they can do is furnish their opinions to local school districts which do have jurisdiction over attendance issues.<BR>
	The state department of education's position that home schoolers must be certified teachers is arguably an unconstitutional invasion of a parent's right to choose home education.  For religiously motivated parents, this interferes with religious rights under both the California and the United States Constitutions.  In order to legally interfere with a fundamental right (i.e., the right to home educate under the 14th and 1st Amendments of the U.S. Constitution), the state would have to demonstrate that it had a compelling interest in seeing every child is taught by a certified teacher and that certification is the least restrictive means available to achieve its objective of literacy and self-sufficiency.<BR>
	This could not be proven, since 49 other states do not require certification.  Therefore, the requirement for certification for home school teachers would be the most oppressive law in the United States, and the state of California should fail in its attempt to require certification for home school teachers.<BR>
	Requests by school districts to view courses of study, qualifications of teachers, and attendance registers are beyond the school district's authority as well.  The Education Code provides that the school district is entitled only to verify that the private school affidavit, which is to be filed between October 1st and 15th each year, has been filed.  The local school district, which is charged with enforcing attendance, does not have the authority to approve, evaluate, or license private schools or any program of a private school.<BR>
	The attempt to charge a fee for processing the affidavit by county departments of education also exceeds the county's authority under the Education Code.  Under Education Code  48222 and  33190, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, not the county office of education, is to receive the filing of the annual affidavit.  However, out of courtesy, the county offices of education have undertaken the role of providing and receiving the private school affidavits.  But merely undertaking another's function does not give authority to &quot;legislate&quot; new requirements.<BR>
	We continue to urge member families not to pay the filing fee, which would set bad precedent for further inroads into the freedoms of private schools in California.<BR>

<i>Sports Bill Update</i><BR>

<P>	First they can't, then they can, then they can't again, and now . . . well, no one knows for sure. Florida home schoolers have been on quite a roller coaster ride lately, regarding whether or not they can participate in inter-scholastic, extra-   curricular student activities. The guidelines of the Florida High School Activities Association (FHSAA) require all students to attend an &quot;accredited public or private school.&quot; Home schoolers have not been permitted to participate in inter-scholastic activities in the past, because the FHSAA does not recognize the legality of home education in the state of Florida. Earlier this year, a bill allowing participation of home schoolers was passed almost unanimously, only to be vetoed by Governor Lawton Chiles. In hopes of returning authority to communities, the Governor called the legislation unnecessary, saying every district was free to permit home schoolers to participate on sports teams. His judgment has been proven false. <BR>
	In an attempt to demonstrate cooperation, the FHSAA has stated that they will allow home schoolers to participate in public school activities as long as they follow certain guidelines. The FHSAA stipulates that home schoolers must ask their local school board for permission to participate in school activities. The school district must then draft a provision allowing individual students to participate.  <BR>
	But even if home schoolers get permission to play from their own school district, the sports event could be considered forfeit, because of previous FHSAA regulations. The regulations require all students to attend an &quot;accredited public or private school.&quot; Therefore, the FHSAA could declare a forfeit in any competition in which home schoolers are involved. <BR>
	According to Florida home school lobbyist Brenda Dickinson, this situation is unsatisfactory. Home schoolers want to be able to participate not only in athletic competitions, but all inter-scholastic activitieswithin public or private schools, and as separate home school groups as well. Many home school groups in Florida are larger than a lot of private schools. <BR>
	Florida home school leaders are scheduled to meet with Governor Chiles and the director of the FHSAA within the next few weeks for possible negotiations. Florida residents are encouraged to write their senators and representatives polite, grammatically correct letters requesting access to all inter-scholastic, extra-curricular activities for public schools, private schools, and separate home school groups.<BR>

<i>School Districts Send Intrusive Forms</i><BR>

<P>	Some school districts in the state of Kentucky are requesting that home schoolers fill out a census form which contains essentially the same information required of public school students.  Some information contained in the census is authorized for private school reporting. <BR>
The only information that a private school (home schoolers operate as private schools in Kentucky) are obligated to provide is the following:<BR>
	1. The name of the school; <BR>
	2. The address of the school; and<BR>
	3. The names and ages of the children attending the school.<BR>
	Kentucky Revised Statute  159.160 does provide that, in addition to the names, ages and places of residents of all pupils in attendance at the school, the superintendent may request any other facts the public school superintendent might require to help carry out the laws relating to compulsory attendance and employment of children.  However, it is our position that the names, ages and places of residences of the pupils is sufficient to assist the attendance officer in carrying out his/her responsibilities.  <BR>
	To require social security numbers, race of child, and other intrusive information about private school students interferes with parental rights under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and, for religiously motivated parents, interferes with the Free Exercise of Religion freedoms under the 1st Amendment.  For the school district to require this information, they would have to demonstrate a compelling interest in receiving the requested information (i.e., it is of the highest importance and that is the least intrusive alternative available).  In this case, the least intrusive means is what is already being provided by home schoolers submitting notification information.<BR>
	We believe the subject school districts will back off; however, at this time we do not have affirmation from the school districts to that effect.  Any HSLDA family receiving requests for information exceeding what is indicated above should contact our office for direction.<BR>

<i>No Accuracy in Advertising in Knox County</i><BR>

<P>	The Knox County Office of Education has taken an interesting approach in their attempt to make home schoolers provide notification of enrollment.  The Office of Education took out a classified ad in the local newspaper, entitled, &quot;NoticeKnox County Parents Who Are Home Schooling.&quot;<BR>
	The advertisement stated that home schoolers had to notify the Recorder of Deeds or the chief school officer of the public school within 30 days of establishing a home school program, and by September 1st annually thereafter in order to comply with the Missouri law.<BR>
	The ad further indicated that parents had to provide the name and age of each child attending the school, the address and telephone number of the home school, the name and address of each person teaching, and the names, addresses, and signature of each person making the declaration of enrollment.<BR>
	The notification was accurate in almost every respect with the exception of one major provision: that, in order to be in compliance with the Missouri law, a home schooler has to give notification.  The home school law provides that: &quot;For the purposes of minimizing unnecessary investigations due to reports of truancy, the home schooling parent or other person responsible for causing the child to participate in a home school program may provide notification to the recorder of deeds or the chief school officer.&quot;<BR>
	Home School Legal Defense Association continues to take the position that home schoolers do not need to provide notice in Missouri.  Unless you are uncomfortable not giving notice, you should not do so.  If you do provide notice, then you are obligated to provide notice annually thereafter according to the statute.<BR>
	One home schooler was on the ball in Knox County.  She immediately ran a &quot;rebuttal&quot; ad to clarify the matter and correct the inaccuracy.  This is a situation where the home schooler had to educate the educators!<BR>

<i>Families in Wappingers Falls Continue to Face Difficulties</i><BR>

<P>	Thirteen Home School Legal Defense Association families residing within the Wappingers Central School District in Wappingers Falls have been notified by the local superintendent that their individualized home instruction plans (IHIPs) are deficient because they are not &quot;measurable.&quot; According to Mr. John G. Marmillo, Superintendent of Schools, measurability can be achieved by either submitting a scope and sequence for all subject areas or copies of the table of contents for all textbooks to be utilized. The authority cited by Mr. Marmillo in requiring this information as part of the families' IHIPs is the handbook developed by the Dutchess County Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) which is, in effect, performing the administrative function of the school district without any express authority to do so. <BR>
	Home instruction in New York is regulated exclusively by the provisions of Section 100.10 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education. In developing an IHIP, parents must submit either a list of the syllabi, curriculum materials, textbooks, or plan of instruction to be used in each of the required subjects. There is no requirement that parents submit a table of contents or scope and sequence chart in order to comply with this regulatory provision. The state education department has provided guidelines for parents and public school officials in situations where a local school district may not be familiar with the textbooks being utilized by the parent. In this situation, it is considered reasonable for the district to require more than the name, publisher, copyright date and author's namethe district may request additional information in the form of a table of contents or written scope and sequence describing the text. <BR>
	Wappingers Falls officials, however, do not claim to be unfamiliar with the textbooks or other curriculum materials described in the IHIPs. Rather, the officials contend that the measurability of a home instruction curriculum must be demonstrated through the submission of the table of contents or scope and sequence charts as a part of the initial IHIP submission to the school district.<BR>
	HSLDA attorney Dewitt Black has responded on behalf of all the member families involved in this controversy, which first arose during the 1994-95 school year. Unless the school officials accept HSLDA's position, it is likely that the superintendent's decision will have to be appealed to the local Board of Education. Last year the local public school officials failed to notify the families of their objections to the IHIPs within the time frame established by the home instruction regulation, a procedural defect which the school district has avoided this year.<BR>

<i>Home School Representatives Meet with DPI Officials</i><BR>

<P>	On August 10, 1995, Home School Legal Defense Association attorney Dewitt Black, Reverend Clinton Birst, Executive Director of the North Dakota Home School Association, and North Dakota attorney Greg Lange met with six officials from the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction (DPI) and a representative from the North Dakota Attorney General's office in Bismarck to review proposals for new administrative rules. The new rules are necessary because of changes in the home school law during the most recent legislative session. <BR>
	DPI officials expressed a desire to include representatives from the home school movement in the development of the new administrative rules in an effort to avoid future litigation and other difficulties. In the past, HSLDA has challenged the actions of DPI and local school districts in North Dakota based upon a different understanding of the legislative intent of the home instruction statutes and our position that the DPI exceeded its authority in administrative rules which were supposed to be issued only on the basis of enacted legislation.<BR>
	After the meeting, it was agreed that five questions would be submitted to the Attorney General of North Dakota for an opinion before the administrative rules are drafted. The issues raised relate to the revised monitoring requirements and standardized testing provisions. After the Attorney General's opinion is received by DPI, another meeting is planned sometime in November to discuss any remaining differences.<BR>

<i>Contacts Kick Off the School Year</i><BR>

<P>	The 1995-96 school year began with an unusual amount of calls from families who were contacted with requests that exceed the home school laws.  One would expect that after six years under the current regulations these matters would become routine.  However, the phone logs at HSLDA prove the contrary.<BR>
	A member family in Covington Exempted Village submitted their notification accompanied by the required outline and list of text books.  In response they received a letter stating that the school district's form must be completed.  We continue to see these kinds of demands in numerous counties.  However, this superintendent went a step further, indicating he wanted &quot;to see, in advance, all the materials, specifically, textbooks and workbooks you would use in your home instruction project.&quot;  This demand far exceeds any authority given to superintendents by home school regulations.<BR>
	Countless county and city superintendents continue to use the &quot;approval&quot; language home schoolers find so objectionable.  They continue to send home schoolers &quot;applications&quot; and &quot;requests for home schooling&quot; even after the family has submitted a notification in compliance with the regulations.  Home schooling is a right protected by the Constitution, not a privilege.  Letters to families that have been &quot;approved&quot; for home schooling violate this principle.  In response, HSLDA has mailed letters to superintendents addressing these concerns. <BR>
	Dayton City Schools continued requiring home schoolers to have their &quot;request&quot; form notarizedanother demand which exceeds regulations.  The Dayton City Schools sent an additional form to home schoolers requesting the student's social security number, ethnic background, last school attended, and an explanation of why the family chose home schooling.<BR>
	Confusion regarding mandatory kindergarten and the compulsory school age continues to reign.  Once again, kindergarten is mandatory if you are going to attend public school first grade.  Home schoolers are not required to report five-year-olds to school officials, nor are they required to start kindergarten once they begin reporting their six-year-old.<BR>
	A student's academic progress was called into question in Highland County as a result of curriculum submitted.  However, academic progress is not measured by curriculum.  Additionally, curriculum is submitted &quot;for informational purposes only.&quot;  The superintendent does not have authority to &quot;approve&quot; curriculum.  His job is to ensure that the required subjects are being covered; not to monitor content.<BR>
	Greene County Board of Education and Xenia City Schools are at the heart of a controversy regarding their revision of home school regulations.  The controversy revolves around the language indicating that the superintendent &quot;or his designee&quot; is to receive and process notifications and, ultimately, excuse children from compulsory attendance.  The home school regulations are clear that the excuse must come from the superintendent.  This has been a matter of much debate and correspondence, and the outcome of this situation is still unclear.  Home school leaders are determining what course of action would be best.<BR>
	HSLDA recommends that Ohio home schoolers become very familiar with the provisions of the home school law in order to detect requests that exceed the law.  If you do not have a copy of our summary of the Ohio law, please contact our legal department and we will be happy to forward one to you.  <BR>

<i>Jasper County Board of Education Reverses Home Schooling Disapproval</i><BR>

<P>	The Jasper County Board of Education has reversed its earlier decision to deny six home schooling families the right to operate home schools for their children. The controversy arose when the board of education, at its meeting on August 14, 1995, voted to disapprove the home schooling applications of these families even though they met all of the legal requirements of the home school statute, Section 59-65-40 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina. No reason was given to the families in the letters notifying them of the board's decision, but a newspaper article appearing in the Jasper County Sun indicated that the decision was based upon the board's opinion that the parents did not possess the necessary qualifications to teach their children at home. Not only did the board refuse to recognize that the parents met the teacher-qualification requirements of the law, the board also failed to notify the parents of the date and time of the meeting and of their right under the home school law to speak in support of their application.<BR>
	Home School Legal Defense Association attorney Dewitt Black wrote a letter to the local superintendent on behalf of the two HSLDA member families in the group. In a later telephone conversation with Attorney Black, the local superintendent agreed to again place the applications on the agenda for the next meeting of the board scheduled for August 28, 1995. This meeting was attended by a number of the parents whose applications had been denied, and they were given an opportunity to express their objections to the board's earlier decision. The board then voted to reverse itself, and all of the home schooling families were approved for the 1995-96 school year.<BR>
	Although there is no question that home schooling is legal in South Carolina by virtue of the statute enacted in 1988, this situation in Jasper County is another example of how parents may be challenged in their right to conduct home education by public school officials who are misinformed or philosophically opposed to home education.

Congressional Action Program Volunteers Put a New Face on Lobbying<BR>

<P>	It's a cold and drizzly autumn day in Washington D.C. The patter of rain on the steps of the Senate office building is accented by the constant swish of umbrellas opening and closing as staffers and politicians scurry to their destinations. Inside the massive marble structures that house America's most prestigious legislators, decisions will be made that affect our entire nation. But that is nothing new.<BR>
	Today is a day like all other days in our nation's Capital. Today, Congress will pass laws. Today, men will make speeches, and special interests will court the favor of Hill staffers. And there will be meetingsthousands of them.<BR>
	Hundreds of yards away, a very different gathering is taking place. In the newly renovated conference room of the Holiday Inn, 60 home educators gather. Many have traveled hours to be here. They come in all ages, heights, and colors, but are absolutely unified in their theme: They have come to ask Congress to leave them alone. <BR>
	As the meeting commences a speaker takes the podium. In his lapel he is wearing a bright red pin with an embossed design of the Capitol domethe insignia of the Congressional Action Program. His name is Doug Phillips. For three years Phillips has been preparing home educators for face-to-face meetings with Congressional leaders. And for three years these moms and dads have been travelling the corridors of Capitol Hill in pursuit of a dreama dream that the blessings of liberty they have enjoyed will pass to their posterity.<BR>
	These families are the minutemen of the home school movement. They are a specially trained group that meets for one purposethe defense of the home schooling family. Sometimes their visits to Washington are carefully planned weeks in advance, other times they are emergency responses to late-breaking legislation.<BR>
	Today's mission: Stop a Congressional attempt to build a nationwide computer-driven registry and tracking system. As home schoolers, these families are painfully aware of the fact that these registries can be used against parents who home educate their children, who employ corporal discipline, or who hold to religious beliefs that are unacceptable to the social workers who surf the database. Complicating matters, some leaders have called for the government to mandate a national I.D. card with a unique biometric identifier. This would mean that every time an American wanted to get a job he would have his retina scanned or his hand geometry analyzed. <BR>
	Phillips begins the debriefing. He walks the group through the key provisions of the bill. Next, he addresses the primary arguments against the tracking program. There is an opportunity for questions and answers followed by a brief time of role playing which gives the Capitol Coordinators a chance to test their familiarity with the issues.<BR>
	Last minute details are covered. Each of the teams has been given a specific assignment and handed information packets. Headquarters is established in the foyer of the Hart Senate Building. Throughout the day, volunteers can check in there, get additional information packets, and report about their meetings. <BR>
	&quot;Remember,&quot; Phillips reminds them, &quot;We will meet by that giant, ugly sculpture that hangs from the ceiling. What is that thing called anyway?&quot; <BR>
	He can never remember what that sculpture is called, but everyone knows what he's talking about. It is hard to miss.<BR>
	The meeting comes to a close. Across the room heads are bowed. Children are praying. Fathers have their arms around their wives and children. God's blessing is invoked. Forty-five minutes after the meeting began, these teams of home school families are off and running. Many will be on their feet for more than six hours before they can return to their cars and begin the long journey back to the warmth and comfort of home. <BR>
Within a ten mile circumference of this hotel room are the headquarters of more than 200 education-related organizations and special interest groups. Many of them exist on taxpayer subsidies. They have set up camp in D.C. to deliver a message: &quot;More money + more power (for them) = better education.&quot; Their jobs and their salaries depend on Congress getting this message. Like the home educators assembled in the quiet Holiday Inn meeting room, these lobbyists will be traveling today to the halls of Congress, but on the quest of a very different agenda.<BR>
	The largest of these groups, the National Education Association, would like to see home schooling banned for the average family. Their lobbyists are well-paid professionals with clout. After being routed in February of 1994 when one million parents said &quot;no&quot; to an NEA-inspired teacher certification provision in the H.R.6 bill, they are on their guard.<BR>
	The contrast between these two groups is stark. One group is comprised of professional lobbyists in search of more government hand-outs for the special interests they represent. The other consists of volunteer parents who are sacrificing time and money to appeal to legislators to make wise decisions on issues which impact the home school family. <BR>
	One chief-of-staff for a well known Democratic Senator told a CAP mom: &quot;Every day I get calls from lobbyists who want to wine me and dine me. Everybody wants a hand-out. I'm tired of it. You are the real thing. A mom who just wants to look out for her family. I'll meet with you any time!&quot; (Paraphrase)<BR>
	These families are making a difference. Often, they are the first, and sometimes even the only, people to hand-deliver outside analysis to the Representatives and Senators on key issues. <BR>
	Of course, sometimes the Congressmen just want to talk about home education. And the results are often surprising. After one visit by home schoolers, a California Congressmen called the National Center and announced that he was so impressed by the meeting that he was persuaded to home school his own children. &quot;How do I get started?&quot; he asked. <BR>
	&quot;Even if they don't agree with us on every point,&quot; Phillips mused to the Capitol Coordinators, &quot;perhaps we'll get them by attrition if we keep having visits like that.&quot; <BR>
	Most of these home schoolers were nervous the first time they entered a Congressional office. The thought of bringing an appeal directly to a United States Senator can make a first-timer quiver in his Rockports. But these home school foot soldiers quickly earn their &quot;Hill-legs.&quot; By the third or fourth visit of the day they are raring to go.<BR>
	Before these families are released as official Capitol Coordinators they must go through an intensive, one-day training program. Since January of 1993 more than 250 home educators have gone through CAP Basic Training. Many of these individuals and families have gone on to be Capitol Coordinators. For three years these stalwarts have been the marine corps of the home school movementthe first to hit the beaches, clearing the way for the calls and letters of thousands of concerned parents whenever legislative threats arise.	<BR>
	The last CAP Basic Training brought about one hundred home educators together for an intensive day of preparation. Those assembled learned about the key federal battlefronts which threaten to undermine home school freedoms and were given Scriptural insights and practical suggestions on how to present home education in the best possible light when meeting with leaders. Emphasis was placed on attitude as well as methodology. And whether the issue was the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, or &quot;how to set up a meeting with a Congressman,&quot; parents were urged to approach their mission with Christian charity and respectfulness.<BR>
	Joe Adams, chaplain of the Kentucky State Legislature, described the way he has seen the Lord work in various legislators' lives. His story is a powerful illustration how one man with faith and vision can make a difference. HSLDA President Michael Farris shared war stories from his experience as a home school litigator which illustrated God's sovereign hand of protection over the home school movement. Veteran &quot;Cappers&quot; shared their experience with the prospective lobbyists about their first visit to Capitol Hill. <BR>
	After sharing the history of the children's rights movement and its assault on the family, CAP Director Doug Phillips discussed the most common pitfalls of Christians entering the political arena. &quot;Christians enter politics to change the world for Jesus, but they end up employing the strategies of compromise and adopting the world's attitudes,&quot; Phillips told the families. &quot;We must act wisely, but all of our activities must be predicated on the understanding that God and God alone is responsible for our success. Our responsibility is simply to be obedient.&quot;<BR>
	The importance of the basic training can not be underestimated. Even so, the heart of CAP is not the training, but the people: fathers and mothers who are willing to sacrifice their time, and lead their children to &quot;stand in the gates of the nation,&quot; families who believe in an America where the sanctity of the home is inviolable, and parents who are free to raise their children in the fear and admonition of the Lord without interference from Big Brother.<BR>
	Some might be surprised to learn that the most effective members of the CAP team are the children. Over the years CAP volunteers have learned that the greatest asset during these visits are the sweet spirits and simple honesty of the students. Frequently, skeptical staffers are uninterested in what Mom and Dad have to saythey want to confront the children. But when confronted with hostile questions, these young people just speak from the heart about why they like being taught at home. Out of the mouths of these babes, the truth is often confirmed.<BR>
	And here is the interesting thing. When a family visiting a Congressional office demonstrates a unity and strength which comes from the togetherness fostered by home education, the barriers of party affiliation, race, and gender cease to be impediments to a successful meeting. Why?<BR>
	In the words of one Congressman, &quot;I will listen to you because I wish my kids loved each other the way yours seem to.&quot; An Open Letter to Home School Moms<BR>
by Michael Farris<BR>

<P>	One of the special privileges I enjoy is the opportunity to interact with thousands of home schooling parents every year at state home schooling conferences and conventions.  At every conference, people come up to me and express gratefulness and appreciation for the work of HSLDA.  I am always especially moved by those who tell me that they pray for us on a regular basis.  That means more to all of us here than can ever be adequately explained.<BR>
	But as I have been watching my wife, Vickie, begin the process of starting our family's fourteenth year in home schooling, a question suddenly occurred to me: <I>Who thanks the </I><B><I>real</I></B><I> heroes of the home schooling movement?</I><BR>
<I>	</I>Vickie is teaching five of our school-age children this year (two have graduated; two are too young).  She is teaching a total of twenty-eight subjects.  And she is washing and cooking and washing and cleaning and washing and driving and washing and shopping and washing and mending and washingall on top of her teaching responsibilities.<BR>
	Vickie is unusual compared to the world at large.  And she is obviously uniquely special to me.  But there are another two or three hundred thousand home schooling moms who are doing essentially the same things.<BR>
	And it's my guess that these ladiesthe real heroes of the home schooling movementrarely hear words of thanks.  So let me give it a try.<BR>

<P><I>To all home schooling moms:</I><BR>

<P><I>T	hanks for being willing to sacrifice the minutes, hours, days, months, and years that constitute your life so your children will have the opportunity to grow up godly, mature, wise, intelligent, and loving.  People who give great sums of money are widely heralded as great philanthropists.  You have given something of far greater value.  You have given your children your very essence so that they may achieve the kind of greatness that God values.  Keep in mind that their only hope for achieving those character qualities is bound up in the fact that you serve the one true God who endows you with those same characteristics.</I><BR>
<I>	Thank you for your plain old hard work.  In the midst of a society bent on obtaining the maximum in convenience, you demonstrate that things of value are not accomplished quickly or on the first try.  You are the exemplars of the virtue of the third, fourth, and fifth tries.  If your children take your example into the American work place, our nation will rise to its former prominence as the country which succeeded because of its simple commitment to hard work.</I><BR>
<I>	Thank you for being willing to encourage other moms who struggle, who are new to the movement, who are discouraged, who need your counsel, your experience, or your wisdom.  The selflessness you demonstrate in the lives of your children pours over into the hours you devote so that others may succeed.  Arguably you have a vested interest in the success of your own children.  You have nothing to gain from helping others.  It is an act of pure altruism.</I><BR>
<I>	Thank you for your obedience to God.  Together with your husband you have read the Scriptures.  You have understood them to lead you in this path of home education.  And regardless of the costs, the difficulties, or the lack of immediate rewards or gratification, you have done what is right simply because it is right.  Few are willing to do right these days for its own sake.  You serve as an example of moral courage that our leaders would do well to copy.</I><BR>
<I>	Thank you for loving your husband.  Your marriage is the human foundation of your home.  When it cracks and crumbles, all that you valueincluding your home schoolingis threatened.  Your selfless love for your husband is an essential ingredient to keeping that foundation strong and true.</I><BR>
<I>	Thank you for taking the time to teach your children the Truth.  So much of education today ignores the truth and simply attempts to impart knowledge separated from the principles of absolute truth which flow from Almighty God.  Your children have the advantage of learning what is real and true and good.  Those things which are cheap counterfeits will always be self-evident frauds to those who have had the good fortune to spend years being exposed to the Truth.</I><BR>
<I>	And finally, thank you for being willing to swim against the stream of society's definition of success.  Stay-at-home moms are given little praise in our society today.  The &quot;mothers of the year&quot; are normally &quot;great moms,&quot; but they are really chosen because they also serve as captains of industry, public policy, or finance.  At the very time the world ridicules a mom who devotes herself exclusively to her family, you have embraced that role with even more enthusiasm than the generations who have gone before you.  Your version of &quot;having it all&quot; means shouldering all of the responsibility for the rearing of your children.</I><BR>
<I>	The feminists won't hold a women's conference in Chinaor anywhere elseto give you the accolades you so richly deserve.  </I><BR>
<I>	But your true reward will never be meager efforts of thanks like this letter.  Your true rewardat least the one you will see here on earthwill be children who rise up, while the rest of the world is stooping in compromise, and call you blessed with their lives, their words, and their deeds.  It is your legacy of love.  Thanks.   </I>

<P>             <BR>

<P>      Prepared by the Home School Legal Defense Association<BR>

<P>Q.   How many home schoolers are there nationwide?<BR>

<P>A.   In a study published in 1990, Dr. Brian Ray of the National Home Education Research Institute estimated that there were 474,000 children being home schooled in America.  This data was based upon the Department of Education's assessment of the 1989-90 school year.  Since that time, HSLDA's membership has grown approximately 25% per year.  Based upon HSLDA's growth and the growth of the home schooling community as a whole (15-25% per year, according to Dr. Ray), there will be approximately 1.2 to 2 million children schooled at home during the 1996-97 school year.<BR>

<P>Our best estimation is that there are between 900,000 and 1.2 million children being taught at home in America.  That would be equal to approximately 330,000 families that are home schooling their children.<BR>

<P>Q.   Why do parents decide to home educate their children?<BR>

<P>A.   Most parents decide to home school because they feel they can provide a better education for their children than public schools or private schools offer.  The rampant problems of drugs, crime, violence, teen pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases in our nation's schools are compelling parents to find alternative learning environments free from these social ills.  Home schooling allows parents to promote good academics, common sense morality, and family unity.<BR>

<P>Q.   Is home schooling legal in all 50 states?<BR>

<P>A.   Yes.  Each state has its own statutes, court decisions, or regulations that pertain to home schooling.  (For more information on a particular state, please contact HSLDA.)<BR>

<P>Q.   What are the legal problems home schoolers face and how does HSLDA attempt to solve them?<BR>

<P>A.   Many families are contacted by school or government officials questioning the legality of home schooling.  The majority of legal challenges we handle are resolved amicably, through peaceful negotiations.  However, thousands of families have faced situations which are far from pleasant.  Hundreds have ended up in court or administrative hearings.  For example: <BR>

<P>Warrants were issued for the arrest of Mark and Chris DeJonge, home-schooling parents in Michigan who were home schooling without a certified teacher.  After being found guilty by lower courts, the DeJonges' case was eventually appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court.  In 1993, the Court ruled that the teacher certification requirement for religious home schoolers was unconstitutional, transforming Michigan from the worst state in the nation for home schooling to one of the best.  The criminal convictions of the DeJonge family were reversed.<BR>

<P>HSLDA filed a federal civil rights action, Jeffrey, et al v. O'Donnell, et al, on behalf of nine home-schooling families against 11 oppressive school districts in 1986.  In 1988, a U.S. District Court Judge ruled that &quot;the tutorial provision of Pennsylvania Compulsory Attendance Law . . . is unconstitutionally vague&quot; and therefore, unenforceable.  As a result of this victory, over twenty cases in court against HSLDA families were won or dismissed. <BR>

<P>In February of 1994, thousands of home schoolers from across the nation flooded the U.S. House of Representatives with phone calls urging an amendment that protected home schoolers from a teacher's certification requirement in H.R. 6.  An amendment protecting home and private schools was passed overwhelmingly.<BR>

<P>The Lund and Reimche families in North Dakota were tried and convicted for the crime of home schooling their children.  HSLDA appealed their case to the North Dakota Supreme Court.  The Court ruled in favor of the families and reversed their truancy convictions.<BR>

<P>HSLDA has also worked successfully to achieve legislative victories by assisting state home schooling organizations with their legislative goals.  The following are just a few examples:<BR>
<ul><li>In 1989, Governor George A. Skinner signed into law North Dakota's new home-<BR>
schooling law, which repealed the state's former teacher certification requirement for all teachers.</li><BR>
<li>Kansas home schoolers defeated H.B. 2392 in 1991, which would have required home<BR>
school children to be taught by certified teachers.</li><BR>
<li>In Oregon, Governor Barbara Roberts signed into law a bill allowing home schoolers to<BR>
participate with public school students in interscholastic activities.</li><BR>
<li>Maryland home schoolers convinced the Maryland Legislature to remove the home visit<BR>
requirement from the department of education's regulations.</li><BR>
<li>In 1993, after making it through the Senate Education Committee with the help of an<BR>
amendment, H.B. 1260 passed, repealing the South Dakota home visit law.</li></ul><BR>

<P>Q.   What are some of the more restrictive states for home schooling?  <BR>

<P>A.   The battlegrounds shift around the nation.  Over the years we have faced fierce or multiple legal conflicts in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia, Iowa, Tennessee, New York, Rhode Island, and North Dakota just to name a few.  Presently, we have cases pending in California, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon and Virginia.

<P>Dear Friend:<BR>

<P>Currently in America, hundreds of families are home schooling children with special needs ranging from attention deficit disorder to severe multiple handicaps.  Parents often find that when they bring these children home to be educated, they come out of the &quot;deep freeze&quot; that has kept them from making significant progress.  Gone are the comparisons, labels, social pressures, and distractions that a regular classroom can bring.  Parents can offer their children individualized education, flexibility, encouragement, and support.  For learning disabled children who function best with &quot;real-life problems&quot; rather than artificial worksheet tasks, home schooling is ideal.  For medically sensitive children, learning at home provides the opportunity for careful monitoring.  And for attention deficit children who function best with less structured time and fewer distractions, home schooling is the answer.<BR>

<P>The decision to home school a child with special learning needs is a weighty one.  Parents may meet pressure from the school district, or even the state, to enroll their child in the system.  Many encounter criticism from well-meaning family and friends, and most must deal with their own fears of inadequacy.  Nevertheless, in record numbers, parents of special needs children are choosing to home educate, and most are finding that the rewards far outweigh the costs.<BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) exists to defend the right of all families to home school.  This includes families who are home schooling a special needs child.  HSLDA will provide the aid of an attorney should your home school encounter any legal problems.  Additionally, HSLDA can supply you with a list of professionals who are qualified to assist you in testing and setting up a plan for teaching your child.  We also offer a list of resources for interested parents who need help in selecting their curriculum.<BR>

<P>Of course, you will have to decide whether home schooling is best for you, your child, and the rest of your family.  HSLDA is here to assist and encourage you.  Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.<BR>

<P>Sincerely,<BR>

<P>Janet Wayne<BR>
HSLDA Special Needs Coordinator<BR>

<P><B>Two Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Special Needs Home School</B><BR>

<P>HSLDA is convinced that home schooling is the best way to meet most special learning needs, and we are delighted to assist dedicated parents in this endeavor.  Our experience in defending home schoolers and in monitoring legislation causes us to believe that the battlefront for home schooling children with special learning needs is rapidly heating up. There are two steps that we recommend our members take to help us defend their home schools.  You may also find it beneficial to take these steps.  As you read through these suggestions, remember that it is best to choose a course of action that fits the severity of your child's special learning needs.<BR>

<P>1. Arrange for regular evaluations and document your child's progress.  <BR>

<P>Whatever the severity of your child's special learning needs, it is important to keep accurate<BR>
records demonstrating how you met these needs and how your child has progressed.  Much of your success in defending your home school against any legal challenges may hinge upon your personal determination of what is best for your child and upon your keeping of accurate records.  <BR>

<P>One of the most important elements of your record keeping should be documentation of periodic evaluations of educational progress.  HSLDA recommends that all families with children who have special learning needs perform such evaluations.  As a general guide, the more severe the special learning need, the more frequent and thorough the evaluations should be.<BR>

<P>There are several options for performing evaluations.  Form C - a sample evaluation form to help you picture the kind of information that would be valuable to document.  (This form is available by calling HSLDA and will be downloadable in the future).  It is best to keep all of your records concerning each special needs child for a minimum of three years or until the child is beyond compulsory school age.  <BR>

<P>2. Obtain assistance in meeting your child's special needs. <BR>

<P>If any of the following are true of your child, we suggest that you obtain some form of assistance.  <BR>

<P>Your child:<BR>
a) has received special education services in this current school year,<BR>
b) has been enrolled in special education services for the coming school year, <BR>
c) has been evaluated and diagnosed as having a special learning need, <BR>
d) is functioning substantially below grade level, <BR>
e) has a physical disability that significantly hinders his or her ability to learn, or <BR>
f) has severe educational difficulties that have been observed but not professionally diagnosed.<BR>

<P>If, after reading this list, you determine that you do need assistance, you will next need to determine what kind of assistance to obtain.  As parents, you are intimately acquainted with your child's needs and are best able to determine what specific help will be most beneficial.  In general, the more severe your child's special learning needs, the more assistance you should obtain to help meet these needs.  We have provided the following options for your consideration.<BR>

<P>A. EDUCATIONAL CONSULTANTS.  Because of the legal complexities involved in dealing with schools and government agencies, one of the safest things you can do to protect your home school is to obtain the services of a special needs educational consultant.  This consultant would be someone who could, in the event you were called upon to defend your home school, serve as an objective expert witness in defense of your home-schooling program.<BR>

<P>This consultant can be anyone who has either credentials or experience in the same area as your child's special need.  Preferably, this person should not be directly related to the child (i.e. parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, etc.).  The consultant should be in contact with your family a minimum of four times during the school year to document your child's progress. <BR>

<P>To find a consultant, there are several different sources you can contact:<BR>

<P>FRIENDS.  It is best to first contact personal friends who might themselves be able to assist you or who might know of someone who can.   <BR>
SUPPORT GROUPS.  Contact your local or state support group for the names of individuals who work with families with special needs children. <BR>
SPECIALISTS.  Families who have children with special needs have often used the services of a number of specialists.  You may want to contact the same individuals who provide their services to public schools; some will also provide their services privately.  <BR>
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.  Some colleges and universities have programs available to help families with special needs children.  Please be aware, however, that they commonly will want your permission to use the results of their work with your child in research-related projects.<BR>

<P>B. PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. The next most beneficial thing you can do to protect your home school is to secure regularly scheduled assistance and/or evaluation for your child through a private program (e.g. Hewitt Research or the National Association for Child Development) that provides services to children who have the same area of special need as your child. <BR>

<P>C. PUBLIC SCHOOL PROGRAMS.   In general, we have found that it is better if families do not use the services offered through their local public school.  We have seen many families end up with legal difficulties because of their involvement with the public school.<BR>

<P>If your family is currently receiving public special education services, you may want to establish a goal to eventually meet all of your child's special education needs through private sources.  We are aware that many families have previously enrolled their child in their local public school's special education program and, now that they are home schooling, they would like to retain these free public services.  We understand that as a matter of economics and ease of access, free public school services are very attractive.  We also understand, however, that strings of regulation come attached to these programs.  Generally, we find that the longer a family uses these programs, the tighter the strings of control become.<BR>
  <BR>
D. OTHER.  Of course, there are other steps you can take that may involve combinations of these suggestions or yet other alternatives. <BR>

<P>HSLDA will do everything we can to protect a family's right to home school a child who has<BR>
special learning needs.  Members of Home School Legal Defense Association are welcome to call our Special Needs Coordinator, Janet Wayne, for assistance with any of the above-described steps, including finding a consultant and giving advice to families who want to withdraw their child from receiving public school services.<BR>

<P>The information provided is designed to assist families in establishing the safest legal environment possible for their home schools.  These recommendations do not constitute legal advice.  <BR>

<P>The forms found on the following page are samples.  HSLDA members who indicate on their<BR>
application or renewal form that they are home schooling a special needs child will be sent<BR>
HSLDA's &quot;Recommendations for Home Schooling Children with Special Needs,&quot; which includes these forms along with instructions for filling them out.  (Sample forms and instructions are available by calling HSLDA and will be downloadable in the future). <BR>

<P>For further information and guidance, read through the questions and answers.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>Questions and Answers for Parents of Special Needs Children</B><BR>

<P>What does Home School Legal Defense Association consider a special need?<BR>

<P>Generally, we define a special needs child as one who is working two or more years behind grade level in the majority of his subjects, a child who has been receiving special education services, or a child with any other disability that seriously affects his/her ability to learn.  <BR>

<P>Do I have the right to home school my special needs child?<BR>
 <BR>
Parents who wish to home school a special needs child have the right to do so under the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution.  This includes parents who presently have their child in an Individual Educational Plan (IEP) set up by their public school's special education department.  <BR>

<P>Parents may feel intimidated by school officials and teachers and are often led to believe that they have fewer constitutional rights to home school a special needs child than a normal child.  <BR>

<P>Even though the Constitution protects the right of parents to home school, most state legislatures have passed statutes regarding home schooling. These laws typically come under the compulsory school attendance statutes for the state, and often contain stricter provisions for families home schooling special needs children. For example, in Iowa, the family of a special needs child must get prior approval from the Area Education Agency (AEA).  In Arkansas, children who have been identified as needing special education services must receive these services from a state-certified special education teacher.<BR>
 <BR>
Do I have a right to therapeutic services offered through the public school? <BR>

<P>It depends on the state you live in, your family's financial need, and the severity of your child's need.  Please be aware, however, that HSLDA discourages families from pursuing services through the public schools.  Instead, we recommend obtaining services provided by private organizations or individuals.  Please note that HSLDA does not assist members in obtaining public school services.     <BR>

<P>What if our family cannot afford to have related services done privately?<BR>

<P>Call us.  The most important consideration is that the special needs of your child are being met. <BR>
HSLDA members who cannot afford private services are encouraged to contact our Special Needs Coordinator for assistance and counsel.<BR>

<P>Does HSLDA require families to use a consultant?<BR>

<P>No.  However, HSLDA does recommend at least quarterly contact with a consultant if the child's needs are severe enough to warrant assistance.<BR>

<P>How long should families retain the assistance of a consultant or educational program?<BR>

<P>It depends.  In general, if the special learning need is remediable through home schooling, you should maintain this assistance until your child is functioning close to grade level.  If the special learning need is such that it cannot be corrected, you should probably continue to receive assistance throughout your home-schooling experience or until your child is no longer of compulsory school age.  The answer to this question may also vary depending upon the specific statutes and regulations in your particular state.<BR>

<P>Must my consultant be currently certified?<BR>

<P>No.  Parents should not be concerned about whether the consultant is currently certified or certified in their state only that they have credentials and/or experience in the area of their child's special need.  <BR>

<P>What if my consultant is making too little or too many recommendations for me to follow?<BR>

<P>It is important to communicate your expectations to your consultant at your initial meeting.  If you are a beginning home schooler, you might want a significant amount of oversight and recommendations from your consultant. If you are an experienced home schooler, however, you might want a consultant who has a hands-off philosophy.  If you find that you are not compatible with the consultant you have chosen, you can locate someone else.  <BR>

<P>Can I obtain the services of a consultant from another state? <BR>

<P>Yes. However, it is best to have a consultant who has met you and your child and is able to meet with you in person. If you choose a person in another state, consider sending samples of your child's work to them and then consulting with them over the phone.  <BR>

<P>What kind of quarterly evaluations are necessary?<BR>

<P>We do not specify what the evaluation should involve but only that there is a review of the child's progress. The most important component of the evaluation is that the parent and consultant are aware of the special needs child's skill levels and how he is progressing with them.  There are many ways to do this other than administering a standardized test.  For instance, if you have written down some domestic goals for your child, such as putting away clean clothes, have a checklist to evaluate whether he is doing this independently.  If he is not, make notes of what he is unable to accomplish and what steps he is failing to understand.  You can share this information with your consultant when you meet quarterly.  The two of you can brainstorm ways to facilitate his progress through these steps.    <BR>

<P>Should I send the evaluations to HSLDA?<BR>

<P>No. Just keep copies in your files at home.  If your home school is ever in jeopardy, we will request these records from you.<BR>

<P>Are evaluations required by the state?<BR>

<P>No. HSLDA requests evaluations for the benefit of the family should they encounter any legal problems as a result of home schooling their special needs child. <BR>

<P>PLEASE REMEMBER: Each state has its own requirements that are separate from these recommendations.<BR>

<P>Am I legally required to have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for home schooling? <BR>

<P>The public school system uses IEPs to set up individual teaching plans, obtain related therapeutic services, and make transportation arrangements if necessary.  Home schooling is a different educational arena. Children no longer have to be transported to class, therapeutic services are done privately, and home schooling offers individualized education for all students not just special needs children.   <BR>

<P>We suggest that parents exercise responsible home schooling by planning and evaluating each child's progress.  For clarification purposes we designate IEPs for home educators as Student Education Plans (SEPs).     <BR>

<P>In addition to legal representation, what services does HSLDA provide for member families who have children with special needs?<BR>

<P>HSLDA provides:<BR>
<ul><li>A list of professionals in the member family's area who have experience and credentials in the area of special needs.  </li><BR>
<li>Available resource guides in the area of your child's special needs.</li><BR>
<li>The Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised, an untimed, individually administered test used for children who do not test well in a lengthy, timed group test with other children.  It must be administered by a special education teacher.</li><BR>
<li>The Brigance Inventory of Basic Skills, a test that helps parents inventory their child's skills.  The purpose of the test is to help parents determine what skills their child has and has not mastered. </li><BR>
<li>The Brigance Inventory of Early Development is for parents of developmentally delayed children from birth to eight years to assess eleven major skill areas.</li><BR>
<li>A special needs coordinator is available should any questions arise concerning home schooling your special needs child.</li></ul><BR>

<P>Consider these advantages for extending your young person's education at home.<BR>

<P><ol><B>If you home school your teens:</B><BR>

<P><li>You get to see the completion of your earlier home-school efforts.</li><BR>
<li>You can customize your teen's education to provide motivation and development for their gifts and abilities. No one else will be able to provide the consistent and loving support in weak areas that you can.</li><BR>
<li>You can start higher education early.</li><BR>
<li>You can continue the family building process.  Teen continue to be in their impressionable and formative years.  This is an invaluable time to cement all your family relationships.</li><BR>
<li>You can be sure your teens are learning if they are at home.  Studies have revealed that public high school students average only two hours and 13 minutes of academic work a day.</li><BR>
<li>You can continue to have influence over their peer relationships.  Teen rebellion is not in God's plan for the family.</li><BR>
<li>You can protect them from pressure to conform to what the other kids are doing.  You won't need to spend time de-programming.</li><BR>
<li>Home school is the best preparation for higher education.  The home education &quot;style&quot; is closer to college type instruction.</li><BR>
<li>There is greater flexibility for work/study opportunities.</li><BR>
<li>Home educators have the best available curriculum and greater selection.</li><BR>

<P><B>If you send your teens to high school:</B><BR>

<P><li>Public schools offer revisionist history and science that promote a humanist perspective.  The godly commitment of many great Americans has been deleted from public textbooks. </li><BR>
<li>The institutional method of public education is designed around &quot;crowd control&quot; not learning.  If and when they learn it will be a by-product of other priorities to maintain class room order.</li><BR>
<li>There will be a diversion away from your academic focus as well as spiritual priorities.  Be aware of the many distractions that won't parallel your home life.</li><BR>
<li>Your young people will be thrown into things like preoccupation with boy/girl relationships, focus on clothes, and pressure to conform in appearance and music.</li><BR>
<li>Vast amounts of time separated from the family will affect their relationship with you.  We have all put great amounts of our heart and time into our home-school years, and we want those efforts preserved.</li><BR>
<li>Age/grade isolation or segregation inhibits normal socialization.  Public school children are behind their home-school counterparts in maturity, socialization, and vocabulary development, as demonstrated by available research.</li></ol><BR>

<P>By Christopher J. Klicka, Esq.<BR>

<P>Many education officials publicly claim that teachers need special &quot;qualifications&quot; in order to be effective.  As a result, public education organizations sometimes target home schoolers with legislation or an interpretation of the law which would require parents to have one of three qualifications: (1) teacher certification, (2) a college degree, or (3) passage of a &quot;teacher's exam.&quot; <BR>

<P>Although this seems reasonable on the surface, such requirements not only violate the right of parents to teach their children as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, but virtually all academic research documents that there is no positive correlation between teacher qualifications and student performance.<BR>

<P><B>Academic Research on Teacher Qualifications</B><BR>

<P>The following summary includes several research projects and opinions of professional educators, confirming the absence of a positive correlation between teacher qualifications and student performance:<BR>
<ol><li>One of the most significant studies was performed by Dr. Eric Hanushek of the University of Rochester, who surveyed the results of 113 studies on teacher education and qualifications.  Eighty-five percent of the studies found no positive correlation between the educational performance of the students and the teacher's educational background.  Although 7% of the studies did find a positive correlation, 5% found a negative impact.</li><BR>
<li>Dr. Sam Peavey, Professor Emeritus of the School of Education at the University of Louisville, earned advance education degrees from Harvard (Master of Arts) and Columbia (Doctor of Education) and was involved in the preparation of thousands of prospective teachers for state certification.  He has served on numerous committees and commissions dealing with the accreditation of schools and colleges.  On September 30, 1988, Dr. Peavey testified before the Compulsory Education Study Committee of the Iowa Legislature on the subject of teacher qualifications, citing numerous studies.  He stated:<BR>
<blockquote>May I say that I have spent a long career in developing and administering programs for teacher certification.  I wish I could tell you that those thousands of certificates contributed significantly to the quality of children's learning, but I cannot. .  .  .  After fifty years of research, we have found no significant correlation between the requirements for teacher certification and the quality of student achievement.</blockquote><BR>
Later in his testimony, Dr. Peavey explains that he has found one valid way of identifying a good teacher:<BR>
<blockquote>However, in spite of years of frustration, I am pleased to report to you there has been discovered one valid, legal, honest, professional, common-sense way to identify a good teacher.  As far as I know there is only one way, and it is about time for legislators to recognize it and write it into school law.  It involves a simple process.  Step one is to stop looking at the teachers and start looking at the students.  Step two is to determine how well students are learning what they are supposed to be learning.  The quality of learning provides the only valid measure of the quality of teaching we have yet discovered.</blockquote><BR>
Dr. Peavey concluded his testimony with practical examples of excellent student achievement by students who were being taught by their parents, most without degrees or certificates.  He explained that many studies demonstrate that home-schooled children &quot;commonly score a year or more above their peers in regular schools on standard measures of achievement.&quot;</li><BR>
<li>Dr. Donald Ericksen, professor of education for the University of California at Los<BR>
Angeles, stated in a recent interview:<BR>
<blockquote>Some of the worst teachers I've ever seen are highly certified.  Look at our public schools.  They're full of certified teachers.  What kind of magic is that accomplishing?  But I can take you to the best teachers I've ever seen, and most of them are uncertified . . . .  We don't have evidence at all that what we do in schools of education makes much difference in teacher competence.</blockquote><BR>
In a well-known case before the Michigan Supreme Court, concerning a Christian school's challenge to the state's teacher certification requirement, Dr. Ericksen testified as an expert witness on teacher certification.  There he explained that extensive research has established that no significant correlation exists between certification (or teacher qualifications) and student learning and that student testing is a far superior method of determining teacher effectiveness.  Dr. Lanier, an expert who testified on the side of the state in favor of teacher certification, admitted under oath that she was unaware of any empirical evidence establishing any correlation between teacher certification requirements and student learning or teacher competence.</li><BR>
<li>Two education researchers, R.W. Heath and M.A. Nielson surveyed 42 studies of<BR>
&quot;competency-based&quot; teacher education.  Their findings were that no empirical evidence exists to establish a positive relation between those programs and student achievement. </li><BR>
<li>L.D. Freeman, R.E. Flodan, R. Howsan, and D.C. Corrigan did separate studies in<BR>
the effectiveness of teacher certification requirements.  They all concluded that there is no<BR>
significant relation between teacher certification and teacher performance in the classroom. </li><BR>
 <li>C. Emily Feistritzer, Director of the private National Center for Education Information, claimed in a recent interview that she does not know &quot;of a single study that says because a teacher has gone through this or that program, he or she is a better teacher.&quot;  Supporters of teacher training programs &quot;argue eloquently that teachers need to be grounded in all of these things, but there has yet to be a study that shows that in fact this is the case.&quot; </li><BR>
<li>John Chubb, a fellow at the Brookings Institute (a liberal think tank), extensively studied various popular reforms including the push to professionalize teaching, the toughening of teacher certification standards, and the implementation of more extensive teacher evaluation systems.  As a result, he authored a book with Terry Moe, Politics, Markets, and America's Schools, on the subject of educational reform.  Mr. Chubb found &quot;no correlation between student achievement and any of the variables on which school reformers have been concentrating so much time, effort, and money.&quot;  He continues, &quot;There is little reason to believe&quot; that these actions will improve student achievement and &quot;there is considerable reason to believe they will fail.&quot; </li>  <BR>
<li>Dr. Brian Ray of the National Home Education Research Institute released a report entitled, A Nationwide Study of Home Education: Family Characteristics, Legal Matters, and Student Achievement.  This was a study of over 2000 home school families in all 50 states.  The research revealed that there was no positive correlation between state regulation of home schools and the performance of home-schooled students.  The study compared home schoolers in three groups of states representing various levels of regulation.  Group 1 represented the most restrictive states such as Michigan; Group 2 represented slightly less restrictive states including North Dakota; and Group 3 represented unregulated states such as Texas and California.  Dr. Ray concluded:<BR>
<blockquote>. . . no difference was found in the achievement scores of students between the<BR>
three groups which represent various degrees of state regulation of home education . . . .  It was found that students in all three regulation groups scored on the average at or above the 76th percentile in the three areas examined: total reading, total math, and total language.  These findings in conjunction with others described in this section, do not support the idea that state regulation and compliance on the part of home education families assures successful student achievement.</blockquote><BR>
Furthermore, this same study demonstrated that only 13.9 percent of the mothers (who are the primary teachers), had ever been certified teachers.  The study found that there was no difference in students' total reading, total math, and total language scores based on the teacher certification status of their parents: <BR>
<blockquote>The findings of this study do not support the idea that parents need to be trained and certified teachers to assure successful academic achievement of their children.</blockquote><BR>
This study has been confirmed by two other studies.  <BR>
<ul><li>Dr. J.F. Jakestraw surveyed the student performance of home schoolers in Alabama and reported:<BR>
<blockquote>This finding suggests that those children in Alabama whose parent-teachers are not certified to teach perform on standardized achievement tests as well as those whose parent-teachers are certified to teach.  Therefore, it is concluded that there is no relationship between the certification status of the parent-teacher and the home-schooled children's performance on standardized achievement tests.</blockquote></li><BR>
<li>Jon Wartes also performed a similar study on home schoolers over three years in the state of Washington and reached the same conclusion.</li></ul><BR>
<li>On the whole, home schoolers' achievements are ranked above average on standardized achievement tests as demonstrated by Dr. Ray's findings in the study cited above (see #8) and in The Right Choice: Home Schooling, which summarizes approximately 35 more studies documenting the success of home schooling.  Dr. Ray and others have found that only 35% of teaching mothers have a college degree or higher and yet their children score no higher on standardized achievement tests than those being taught by mothers without a college degree.</ol><BR>
<B>Conclusion of Academic Research</B><BR>

<P>In conclusion, nearly all existing research on teacher qualifications or state regulations demonstrates that they have no significant relation to student performance.  In fact, teacher qualification requirements have no positive correlation with even teacher performance.  In the end, as the Coleman Report (U.S. Office of Education, 1964) pointed out, families are the most important factors in determining a student's academic performance.<BR>

<P><B>Statutory Trend Lessening Teacher Qualification Requirements</B><BR>

<P>The trend across the United States is not to apply any teacher qualifications standards to home schoolers.  The emphasis seems to be on protecting parental rights and in several states, focusing on student performance through an annual test or portfolio evaluation.<BR>

<P>As of April 1994, forty states do not require home school parents to have any specific qualifications.  Home schoolers in these states can home school without proof of any particular educational qualifications.  In fact, of the ten states that do have qualification requirements, eight of them require only a GED or high school diploma. The states in this category are North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arizona, and New Mexico.  Of the remaining two states, only North Dakota requires the passage of a &quot;teacher's test,&quot; and West Virginia requires the parent's education to be at least four years higher than his child's.  New Mexico required a bachelor's degree, but this requirement was repealed in 1992, leaving a high school diploma or GED as the standard.  South Carolina also previously required a college degree or a teacher's examination, but this was struck down by the South Carolina Supreme Court in Home School Legal Defense Association's (HSLDA) case Lawrence v. South Carolina Board of Education, 412 S.E.2d 394 (1991).  South Carolina now only requires a GED or high school diploma.  Tennessee used to require that parents who were teaching children in high school have a college degree.  In 1994, this was amended to allow parents to teach their high school-aged children with only a high school diploma or a GED as long as they were under the supervision of a &quot;church-related school.&quot;  Michigan was the last state to require home school parents to have teaching certificates.  Many states formerly had a law like Michigan's, but such teacher qualifications requirements were abandoned.  On May 25, 1993, the Michigan Supreme Court struck down the teacher certification requirement as unconstitutional in HSLDA's case, People v. DeJonge, 501 N.W.2d 127 (1993).  Under DeJonge, religious home schoolers have no qualification requirements.<BR>

<P><B>Major Cases on Teacher Qualifications for Home Schools and Private Schools</B><BR>

<P>The list below contains several cases in various states which dealt with the issue of teacher qualifications and found teacher certification requirements or college degree requirements to be excessive or unconstitutional.<BR>
<ol><li><B>New York:</B>  In New York, instruction &quot;elsewhere&quot; must be given by a &quot;competent&quot; teacher.  3204. The court has interpreted competent not to mean certified. In re Franz, 55 A 2d 424, 427 (1977).  Furthermore, home school regulations adopted in June 1988 do not require home school parents to have any qualifications.  Home school parents are &quot;competent&quot; as long as they file a notice of intent, quarterly reports of progress, and test results every other year beginning in third grade.</li><BR>
<li><B>New Jersey:</B>  New Jersey allows &quot;equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school.&quot; <BR>
18A:38-25. Regarding the interpretation of the word &quot;equivalent,&quot; the New Jersey Supreme Court stated: &quot;. . . perhaps the New Jersey Legislature intended the word equivalent to mean taught by a certified teacher elsewhere than at school.  However, I believe there are teachers today teaching in various schools in New Jersey who are not certified . . . .  Had the legislature intended such a requirement, it would have said so.&quot;  New Jersey v. Massa, 231 A.2d 252, 256 (1967).</li><BR>
<li><B>Ohio:  </B>Ohio law [Ohio Rev. Code Ann.  3321.04(A)(2)] requires home school<BR>
teachers to be &quot;qualified.&quot;   State Board of Education regulations define &quot;qualified&quot; as a GED or high school diploma.  (See Ohio State Board of Education Administrative Code Chapter 3301-34.)  Prior to these regulations, in Ohio v. Whisner, 47 Ohio St.2d 181, 214 (1976), the Ohio Supreme Court struck down Ohio's Minimum Standards which required teacher certification, stating &quot;And equally difficult to imagine, is a state interest sufficiently substantial to sanction abrogation of appellants' [parents'] liberty to direct the education of their children.&quot;  The Court also pointed out that the state &quot;did not attempt to justify (prove) its interest in enforcing the minimum standards (which included teacher certification requirements) as applied to non-public religious schools.&quot; Id. at 217.</li><BR>
<li><B>Michigan:</B>  On May 25, 1993, Michigan's teacher certification requirement for home school parents was struck down by the highest court in the state.  The Michigan Supreme Court declared:<BR>
<blockquote>In summary, we conclude that the historical underpinnings of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the case law in support of it compels the conclusion that the imposition of the certification requirement upon the DeJonges violates the Free Exercise Clause.  We so conclude because we find that the certification requirement is not essential to nor is it the least restrictive means of achieving the State's claimed interest.  Thus, we reaffirm that sphere of inviolable conscience and belief which is the mark of a free people.  We hold that the teacher certification requirement is an unconstitutional violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment as applied to families whose religious convictions prohibit the use of certified teachers.  Such families, therefore, are exempt from the dictates of the teacher certification requirements.</blockquote><BR>
This decision vindicates the dissent in a three to three split of the Michigan Supreme Court in 1986 in a private school case involving the requirement of teacher certification.  In this case, Sheridan Road Baptist Church, three justices found:<BR>
<blockquote>...enforcement of the teacher certification requirement, as applied, is not essential to achieve the objective.  Unless and until the state can show otherwise, the enforcement of the statutory teacher certification requirement, as applied, would be violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</blockquote></li><BR>
<li><B>Indiana: </B> Indiana allows home schools under their law which exempts children from compulsory attendance if they are &quot;provided with instruction equivalent to that given in public schools.&quot;  20-8.1-3-34.  A federal court when trying to interpret the word &quot;equivalent&quot; stated &quot;. . . it is now doubtful that the requirements of a formally licensed or certified teacher . . . would pass constitutional muster.&quot;  Mazenac v. North Judson-San Pierre School Corporation, 614 F.Supp. 1152, 1160 (1985).  The Court would not interpret &quot;equivalent instruction&quot; as requiring certified teachers because of the constitutional problems involved.</li><BR>
<li><B>Massachusetts:</B>  In this state, &quot;a child who is otherwise instructed in a manner approved in advance by the superintendent . . .&quot; is exempted. ch. 76, 1.  When establishing guidelines for approving home schools, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court stated that the superintendents or school committees could not require the parents to be certified or have college degrees.  The Court said: &quot;While we recognize that teachers in public schools must be certified, certification would not be appropriately required for parents under a home school proposal. . . .  Nor must parents have college or advanced academic degrees.&quot;  Care and Protection of Charles, 504 N.E.2d 592, 602 (Mass. 1987).  In fact, the home school mother in this case, in whose favor the Court ruled, did not even have a high school diploma. 504 N.E.2d at 594, fn. 2.</li><B> </B><BR>
<li><B>Kentucky: </B> In Kentucky, home schools operate as private schools.  When private<BR>
schools were required to use certified teachers even though the statute was unclear, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that teacher certification did not apply to private schools and could not be mandated.  See Kentucky State Board v. Rudasill, 589 S.W.2d 877, 884 (1977). </li><B> </B><BR>
<li><B>Hawaii:  </B>In Hawaii, &quot;parents teaching their children at home shall be deemed qualified instructors.&quot;  Dept. of Ed. Regs. 4140.2(D)(2).  In other words, parents are qualified because they are parents. </li><B> </B>  <BR>
<li><B>South Dakota:  </B>In South Dakota, a child formerly was allowed to be &quot;otherwise provided with competent instruction.&quot;  However, in 1993, that statute was amended specifically to delete the term &quot;competent&quot; thereby removing all qualification requirements on parents who teach their own children.  Nonetheless, a safeguard remains in the statute which states &quot;the individuals [who give instruction] are not required to be certified.&quot;</li><B> </B>  <BR>
<li><B>North Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa: </B> In all three of these states, teacher certification<BR>
requirements were upheld by the courts.  See North Dakota v. Shaver 294 N.W. 2d 883 (1980), Nebraska v. Faith Baptist Church, 301 N.W. 2d 571 (1981), and Fellowship Baptist Church v. Benton, 815 F.2d 485 (1987).  In each of these cases no expert testimony or evidence was given to prove teacher certification was necessary or essential for children to be educated.  In fact, the state could also not prove, with evidence, that teacher certification was the &quot;least restrictive means&quot; for children to be educated.<BR>
<p>Furthermore, the legislatures in all three of these states have mooted these cases and vindicated home schooling parents by repealing the teacher certification requirements.  Nebraska and Iowa have created an option in their compulsory attendance statutes to allow parents to home school without any qualifications.  North Dakota allows parents to pass a &quot;teacher' test&quot; in order to opt out of teacher certification.  [See Revised Stat. of Nebraska  79-1701(3); N.D. Century Code 15-34.1-03; and Iowa H.F. 455(1991)]</li><B> </B></ol><B> </B>    <BR>
<B>Conclusion</B><BR>

<P>Educational research does not indicate any positive correlation between teacher qualifications and student performance.  Many courts have found teacher qualification requirements on home schoolers to be too excessive or not appropriate.  The trend in state legislatures across the country indicates an abandonment of teacher qualification requirements for home school teachers.

<P>On the anniversary of Home School Legal Defense Association's tenth year of service to the<BR>
home school community, we want to take time to reflect on the past decade remembering the<BR>
joys and sorrows, the bitterness of defeat and the sweet celebration of victories.  Anniversaries are<BR>
also times to look ahead, to chart our course, and to prepare for the future. <BR>

<P>Marking the Milestones is our tribute to the pioneers of the home-schooling movement who<BR>
blazed the trail for those who have followed.  It is our monument to the courage, vision, and<BR>
steadfastness of the parents who stood firm in the face of adversity.  It is our vision for the future. <BR>
And it is our testimony to the greatness of our God.  He truly is our protector!<BR>

<P><i>I will remember the deeds of the Lord; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.  I will<BR>
meditate on all your works and consider all your mighty deeds.  <B>Psalm 77:11-12</i></B><BR>

<h3>Home School Legal Defense Association: A Ten Year Perspective</h3><BR>
Ten years ago, when Michael Farris and Michael Smith founded Home School Legal Defense<BR>
Association in March of 1983, home schooling was just a tiny blip on the education radar screen. <BR>
The concept of parents teaching their children at home was relatively obscure at that time.  The<BR>
families who chose to follow this non-traditional education route were fairly certain to face<BR>
opposition from the educational bureaucracy and following legal entanglements, as well as from<BR>
their own friends and family.<BR>

<P>Looking back over the years it is amazing to see how Home School Legal Defense Association<BR>
has grown and developed, and how God has led us to where we are today.  HSLDA started with<BR>
a handful of member families, Michael Farris working from his home in Olympia, Washington, and<BR>
Michael Smith from his law office in Santa Monica, California.  Shortly thereafter, Michael Farris<BR>
was hired to head up the legal department for Concerned Women for America in Washington,<BR>
DC.  He moved his family east, and the HSLDA &quot;office&quot; relocated in Fort Worth, Texas.  In<BR>
1984, Attorney Jordan Lorence was hired to work two part-time jobs; one half of his time was<BR>
devoted to HSLDA, the other half to CWA.  At that time the membership records were<BR>
transferred from Fort Worth to Washington, DC.  Within a year, Home School Legal Defense<BR>
Association's membership had grown to the point that a real office and a full time staff were<BR>
needed. Melinda Allen was HSLDA's first full-time employee, followed by Christopher Klicka<BR>
who was hired as HSLDA's executive director to handle membership services and legal contacts. <BR>
Michael Farris was full-time by the fall of 1986, and Michael Smith by March of 1987.<BR>

<P>Today, Home School Legal Defense Association employs over thirty staff in both full-time and<BR>
part-time positions.  Our office is now in Purcellville, Virginia, about 50 miles west of<BR>
Washington, DC.<BR>
All six of HSLDA's attorneys are home-schooling dads. Among our current staff, we are home<BR>
schooling, or have finished home schooling, 32 children.  Four home school graduates work for us<BR>
in various staff positions, as well as several others who work for us part time.  Defending home<BR>
schoolers is not just a job for us it is our very way of life and our heartfelt conviction.<BR>

<P>Although HSLDA has changed in the past ten years in terms of the size of our membership, the<BR>
number of staff, and our physical location our original vision and purpose remains unchanged. <BR>
HSLDA exists expressly for the purpose of defending the rights of home-schooling parents.<BR>

<P>During the last decade home schooling has been recognized as &quot;legal&quot; in every state.  Each state<BR>
varies, however, as to the manner in which it restricts the right of parents to teach their children at<BR>
home.  Because of vague or overly-restrictive laws, many parents still face criminal prosecution<BR>
every year.  Today, just as ten years ago, the enormous expense of legal defense in such situations<BR>
can intimidate families into moving, or even abandoning home schooling.  HSLDA, by bringing<BR>
together a large number of home-schooling families, enables each family to have a low-cost<BR>
method of obtaining quality legal defense.<BR>

<P>The cost of membership in Home School Legal Defense Association, $100.00 annually per family,<BR>
has not increased in eight years. Although our costs of operation have risen dramatically, the<BR>
number of families who have joined makes it possible for us to maintain the $100.00 cost of<BR>
membership per family.<BR>

<P>The National Center for Home Education was founded by HSLDA in February 1990, to serve<BR>
state leaders by providing information about state and federal legislation of concern to home<BR>
schoolers.  The National Center also works on special public relations projects related to home<BR>
schooling and functions as a &quot;clearing house&quot; of major home school research and other news and<BR>
resources regarding home schooling.  In January 1993, the National Center launched the<BR>
Congressional Action Program (CAP) in response to the concern raised by many home school<BR>
families over the direction of the Clinton Administration's policy regarding parental rights and<BR>
education reform.  The mission of CAP is to target action for federal measures which have a<BR>
direct impact on home schooling.<BR>

<P>In the fall of 1991, HSLDA of Canada was launched in response to repeated calls for assistance<BR>
from Canadian home schoolers.  Americans and Canadians share common legal traditions.  Many<BR>
of the constitutional principles relevant to home schooling are well established in Canadian<BR>
constitutional law. We are greatly encouraged to be able to begin helping home schoolers in<BR>
Canada, who have many similar problems to the ones we experience here in the United States. <BR>
HSLDA of Canada is a separate, sister organization to HSLDA, USA, and our goal is for it to<BR>
become entirely self-sufficient.<BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Association's original vision was to help home schoolers and only<BR>
home schoolers, and we have remained faithful to that vision.   We are committed to the overall<BR>
success and advancement of home education in the arenas of the courts, education, the media,<BR>
Congress, state legislatures, churches, families, and neighborhoods.  And we are committed to<BR>
providing you with our very best efforts to enable you to home school your children in peace and<BR>
freedom for the years to come!<BR>

<B>Remembering HSLDA: the Good, the Bad, the Inspiring</B><BR>
Recently, we spent time reminiscing about the history of the Home School Legal Defense<BR>
Association with  &quot;old-timers&quot; Michael P. Farris, J. Michael Smith, and Christopher J. Klicka. <BR>
We discussed the early years of HSLDA, the way home schooling has changed, and some of their<BR>
most memorable cases.  We found their stories quite interesting . . .<BR>

<P>What are some of the events that led up to HSLDA's founding?<BR>
Farris: Vickie and I decided to home school our daughter Christy.  We had independently heard<BR>
messages about home schooling, and we talked about it and decided that we would try it for a<BR>
year.  When the word got out that we were home schooling our children, I started getting a lot of<BR>
phone calls.<BR>

<P>Smith:  I'd been working with CHEA of California for some time, ever since I started home<BR>
schooling in 1981.  I had a meeting with Mike Farris in Sacramento at a home school conference. <BR>
He was looking for someone to found the organization with him, and one of the founders of<BR>
CHEA recommended me.  Mike explained the concept, and I said I thought it would work.  That<BR>
must have been in 1982. <BR>
I was representing mostly California families at that time, by writing letters and making phone<BR>
calls.  I'd hate to go back and look at some of those letters today, but they worked<BR>
then miraculously.<BR>

<P>What were some of the cases that HSLDA handled in 1983?<BR>
Farris: Our first actual case was when we filed a constitutional challenge against the Washington<BR>
state law.  That was a test case.  While the case was pending, the Washington legislature changed<BR>
the law and passed the current home school law there.<BR>

<P>I do remember another really early case.  The child had been in the public school around<BR>
Vancouver, Washington, for kindergarten and first grade and had come out of public school<BR>
testing below grade level.  The mom home schooled for two years and the child was then scoring<BR>
around the 8th or 9th grade level about four grades above grade level in almost all subjects. <BR>
The prosecutor was initiating a case of criminal prosecution for truancy against the family because<BR>
home schooling if you weren't a certified teacher was illegal in Washington state at the time at<BR>
least according to government officials. So I told the prosecutor, &quot;Good, go ahead and file the<BR>
case. We are looking for a test case.  If you do file it, we'll give this nine year old the GED and<BR>
once he passes, what are you going to do then?&quot;  I never heard from the prosecutor again.  So<BR>
that case is still technically pending.  (I don't think they're going to pursue it because by now the<BR>
child would be nineteen or twenty years old.)<BR>

<P>How many families were members that first year?<BR>
Farris:  At the end of the first year there were about 200 member families.  We got the word out<BR>
by going to a few home school conferences in Dallas, Sacramento, and Portland.  The main<BR>
problem to overcome the first year was that we didn't have any staff to speak of.  It was basically<BR>
all volunteer efforts.  I remember running the first year's problems out of our house in Olympia<BR>
before we moved to Washington, DC.  I did a whole lot of phoning: &quot;Hello, this is Home School<BR>
Legal Defense Association . . . &quot; <BR>

<P>Smith:  One of the early challenges was that we didn't have any paid lawyers the first year or<BR>
two. Jordan came in 1984 part time, then we hired Melinda Allen as our first full time employee,<BR>
and Chris came in June of 1985 as the first time full time legal staff member. We didn't have too<BR>
many members at that time.  Mike Farris and I had divided up the states to address legal contacts. <BR>
He had east of the Mississippi and I had west of the Mississippi.  Board meetings were held over<BR>
the telephone.   <BR>

<P>At what point did your &quot;part time&quot; project overtake your full time life?<BR>
Farris:  I frankly thought that the organization was going to take off.  I thought HSLDA would<BR>
get to be an organization of about 10,000 people the first year, year and a half, because I thought<BR>
all the home schoolers would join.  Instead, we had slow growth rather than rapid growth.  The<BR>
reality was that if the organization had grown as rapidly as I thought it was going to grow, I<BR>
would never have left Washington state.  Because it failed to grow rapidly, we moved to Virginia<BR>
so that I could work with Concerned Women for America and have a paying job. But I am<BR>
absolutely confident that that was a way for us to get direction.  I am confident that's where we're<BR>
supposed to be and that would not have happened if we'd had the initial rapid growth that I<BR>
anticipated.<BR>

<P>Smith:  When we started the organization, I never thought about working full time for HSLDA. <BR>
But I moved to Virginia in March of '87, because I was interested in doing this kind of work and<BR>
in getting out of California with my little ones.  In spring of '87, I recall having 3,600 members.  I<BR>
think 30-40% were California members.<BR>

<P>What brought you to HSLDA?<BR>
Klicka:  My general goal was always to go into just constitutional law, like Concerned Women<BR>
for America or the Rutherford Institute.  In the summer of 1984 I had worked as an intern for<BR>
John Whitehead, and my project was doing an analysis of all the state laws and court decisions <BR>
regarding home schooling.  I started sending out resumes the second half of 1985, and I sent one<BR>
to Mike Farris for a job at CWA for religious freedom issues.  I got a response within three days. <BR>
Mike said, &quot;I'd like to interview you, I've started this organization called Home School Legal<BR>
Defense Association.  You know more about home-schooling laws than I do.&quot;  Mike and Jordan<BR>
were coming down to Tulsa within the next month to speak at an education seminar.  I met them<BR>
and was interviewed. I liked them; they liked me.  The following week they flew me down to meet<BR>
Jim Carden in Texas.  They hired me. As soon as I graduated in May, I went straight to DC and<BR>
started working part time while I studied for the bar examination.  I came on full time in August<BR>
after the bar.  I've worked here full time ever since.  <BR>

<P>What do you remember most about the early days? <BR>
Klicka:  Fear.  People were afraid.  Families wanted to know if it was legal.  Many times I<BR>
couldn't say it was legal, except from a constitutional perspective that they had the right to do<BR>
it.  So we would just assert that regardless of whether the state made it legal or not, parents have<BR>
the right to home school.  The state is simply wrong, and the excessive restrictions on home<BR>
schooling are unconstitutional.<BR>
It was at that point that I put together the chart of the 50 states to give people some basis as to<BR>
how they could legally home school.  It forced me to look at each state to figure out, &quot;Can they<BR>
be a private school?&quot; &quot;Is there a home school law?&quot; &quot;How do we get around approval?&quot;  And that<BR>
was what we were trying to do in those summaries.  We'd send them out to folks who called.<BR>

<P>When did you begin to sense that the fear was alleviated?  Was it a gradual process or was<BR>
there a definite break point?<BR>
Klicka:  Well, from '85 on, we saw a pretty steady gain in the legislatures.  Up until 1990, three<BR>
to four states per year were changing their laws.  By 1990, people were feeling pretty confident. <BR>
There were only a very few states that were giving us problems as far as the very right to exist. <BR>
I'd say about 1990 it shifted.  Now the issue is how far can they regulate us, rather than do we<BR>
have the right to exist.  Then the DeJonge case this year probably put to rest the last really bitter<BR>
attack on home schooling in any state.  And we've had so many victories in the courts and<BR>
legislatures, it's phenomenal.  The fear has gone away and confidence has set in.<BR>

<P>What do you see as the major battles of the last ten years?<BR>
Klicka:  Discretionary approval was a major battle.  In many states the school districts had the<BR>
authority to determine any type of rules and regulations on home schoolers.<BR>

<P>Smith:  And we still have that battle in three or four states Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and<BR>
Utah.  South Carolina is technically an approval state, but there are some loopholes.<BR>

<P>Klicka:   Another major fight was over teacher qualifications.  We had to slug that out in Iowa,<BR>
North Dakota, and Michigan for years and years.  In Alabama, it still is an issue because the<BR>
state's position is that a parent has to be a certified tutor in order to home school. However, we<BR>
have figured a way around it through the church school exemption route.<BR>
I would say that we have the most problems each year in the private school states.  There is no<BR>
uniform home school law.  It continues to be a problem, but in a lesser degree, because we've<BR>
probably written to most every school district in California, Kansas, Indiana, Alabama, Texas, and<BR>
the seven other private school states.  Essentially we were creating policy in those states without<BR>
the legislature, just by our interpretation of the laws and winning some cases.  We've said the<BR>
same thing over and over and over until it just became the general way of interpreting the law.  In<BR>
Alabama the department of education says you can't home school unless you're a certified tutor,<BR>
but talk to any school district, and they'll say that you can if you do it under the church school<BR>
exemption.<BR>
Home visits, that was another big one.  We've reduced that to primarily Massachusetts and we're<BR>
still slugging it out in court there.<BR>

<P>Let's talk about cases: the worst, the best, the most inspiring.<BR>
Farris:  All of the cases in North Dakota were bad cases.  We were very frustrated trying to get<BR>
justice there.  Prosecutors were able to file briefs, arguing that the reason you need to have<BR>
certified teachers in the public schools was that kids need to have the experience of being beat up<BR>
by bullies on playgrounds.  It was so ridiculous in one case they argued that you have to have<BR>
certified teachers so you could get eye examinations in the public schools. The father was an eye<BR>
surgeon and the mother a nurse.  Certified teachers don't do eye examinations and if they do, they<BR>
don't do them nearly as well as a nurse or an eye surgeon. It was just nuts!<BR>

<P>Smith:  A case that hurt Chris was one we don't like to talk about because we lost.  You recall<BR>
that one, Chris, because we got jacked around on that one badly.  That was an injustice.  That was<BR>
the Schmidt case in Ohio.  <BR>

<P>Klicka:  That was one that started at the same time as DeJonge.  I'd put so much effort into that,<BR>
in the appeal process, getting it up to the Ohio Supreme Court.  The issue in Ohio was one of<BR>
approval whether the state had the right to approve or disapprove home schoolers.  We said<BR>
they didn't.  And all the facts were in our favor, the law was in our favor, but we had this<BR>
prosecutor who was very antagonistic.  She was very dilatory.<BR>

<P>Farris:  We had a brief-filing deadline that we were having a difficult time meeting.  So that we<BR>
wouldn't miss the deadline (this was in the early days of Federal Express), we put my secretary<BR>
Lois Ventsias on an airplane and flew her to Columbus, Ohio, from Washington National to file<BR>
the brief on time.  The prosecutor filed every brief in the appellate process 20-30 days late.  There<BR>
was a court rule in Ohio that if you didn't file the brief on time you didn't get to argue.  And that<BR>
if they had any legitimate plausibility to their case at all, the side filing on time would win over the<BR>
side that didn't file on time. But they totally ignored that.  <BR>

<P>Klicka:  Finally the ruling came down from the Ohio Supreme Court, which was the same court,<BR>
Mike, that ruled in the Whisner decision, which was a tremendous victory for Christians. So we<BR>
anticipated a victory, and they totally nailed us.  <BR>

<P>Farris:  The Christian community had rallied behind this judge who was professing to be a<BR>
Christian to elect him as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio, replacing a judge who<BR>
was philosophically alleged to be aligned with the ACLU.  And the Christian judge made the<BR>
ruling against us in Schmidt and so we really took a beating on that case both in terms of the<BR>
fairness of the procedure and the ultimate outcome.<BR>
 <BR>
Klicka:  It was devastating because the court wrote up a statement of facts that was totally<BR>
inaccurate.  It fit what the prosecutor had been essentially misleading the court on.  They didn't<BR>
look back and see what the real record was.  They ruled that they had to be approved, that  this<BR>
was a constitutional right and authority of the state.  This opened up the potential for untold<BR>
litigation in Ohio, because each school district did what was right in their own eyes and every<BR>
district had a different policy and interpretation.  We lost and I just couldn't believe it.  But God<BR>
worked it out.  We set the Schmidts up under the cover of a private school, so they could<BR>
continue home schooling.  Then shortly after that the regulations came down.  And that's the way<BR>
God always worked. If we didn't win the case, we won it through the legislature or regulations. <BR>
Or vice versa, sometimes a case was used to get the law passed.<BR>

<P>I would say the two best cases we've had were the Jeffery case in Pennsylvania, and the DeJonge<BR>
case from the Michigan Supreme Court.<BR>
Jeffery was tremendous because we had over thirty families being prosecuted for home schooling,<BR>
and 501 school districts that had different interpretations of the law.  It was endless work.  The<BR>
federal court just swept down after two years and said, &quot;this law is completely void for vagueness<BR>
and unconstitutional.&quot;  It was nice to go back to all of those 501 school districts and say, &quot;see<BR>
that's what we've been trying to tell you.  You didn't have to take these people to court, you<BR>
didn't have to harass them like you did.&quot;  That was a thrilling decision.<BR>

<P>And of course the DeJonge decision was even more significant, because it brought relief to a state<BR>
that had been one of the most heavily persecuted states over the last ten years.  It knocked out the<BR>
teacher certification requirement for both religious home schools and private schools.  In addition,<BR>
it ended up being one of the best religious freedom cases that has come down since probably<BR>
Yoder in 1972.  It accurately defined the original intent of the Constitution's framers.  The 38th<BR>
page of the opinion could have been written by James Madison himself!  And DeJonge was<BR>
especially rewarding because it took so long to get there 8 years. <BR>

<P>Farris:  That's a case that we longed for, prayed for, worked for, for such a long time.  It was the<BR>
most significant victory not just for HSLDA, but for home schoolers ever, anywhere, anytime,<BR>
anyplace.  <BR>

<P>But the Robin Diegel case in Ohio is the most inspiring case ever. The day before the trial I flew<BR>
out there and went to Mrs. Diegel's home. I went out in her backyard, and we sat at the picnic<BR>
table.  I was getting her prepared for trial and was talking to her about her religious beliefs.  It<BR>
was obvious to me that she really  didn't know the Lord even though she had a high respect for<BR>
the Word of God and was oriented toward Christian things.  So I walked her through the steps of<BR>
salvation, and she prayed to receive Christ that afternoon.<BR>

<P>The next day I walked into the trial.  The judge called us into his chambers and said, &quot;Mr. Farris, I<BR>
just read the Schmidt decision from the Supreme Court of Ohio.  You lost that case.  You're<BR>
going to lose this case, again today.&quot;  You know, I've been in courts where I thought the judge<BR>
had made up his mind before we started, but I never had one openly tell me.  <BR>
I went out, but I did not tell Robin what the judge said.  I had told her the night before that I<BR>
thought that God was going to do something really powerful in her case to welcome her to His<BR>
family, and to go home and read the Bible.  (I thought maybe she'd read the part in Deuteronomy<BR>
about stoning false prophets.)<BR>

<P>The prosecutor put his case on first.  He called the superintendent.  My turn to cross examine<BR>
came up, and I asked a question I've never asked before and I never have asked since.  It's a<BR>
dumb question.  It's objectionable really.  I asked, &quot;Did you get any legal advice before you<BR>
decided to turn this lady down in her right to home school?&quot;  The superintendent should have<BR>
said, &quot;no.&quot;  What could I have said?  Rather than do that he tried to justify himself.  He said,<BR>
&quot;Well, I didn't talk to any lawyers or anything like that but I talked to some government officials.&quot; <BR>
I said, &quot;Well, like who?&quot;  He said, &quot;Well, like the judge here.&quot;  I said, &quot;You talked to this judge<BR>
about this lady's case before this thing ever came to court?&quot;  He said, &quot;Yeah.&quot;  You should have<BR>
seen the judge's face.  There was a newspaper reporter in the courtroom.  <BR>

<P>The judge called recess, and he took us back into the chambers.  This time he was talking to the<BR>
prosecutor.  He said, &quot;You find a way to approve this lady.&quot;  We had some pow-wows in the hall,<BR>
and she got approved.  We went out and announced that in court.  The judge was very concerned<BR>
that the newspaper reporter be informed that this case had been approved and none of this<BR>
discussion business made it into the press.  It turns out the judge just made a good faith mistake. <BR>
He wasn't being a bad guy.  He was just a brand new judge and didn't know what the rules were. <BR>
It worked out.  The one question that was the chink in their armor jumped into my head out of the<BR>
blue.  That illustrates better than anything I know who is really the advocate here.  It's not us. <BR>
It's God.  That is the story of HSLDA that God is our advocate, and we're just the conduits.<BR>

                     <B>  At the Crossroads</B><BR>

<P>A glance at the decade behind us . . .<BR>
&quot;Home schooling?  Is it legal to do that?&quot;  The early days of the home education movement were<BR>
characterized by parents who possessed bold courage, a rugged pioneering spirit, and deep<BR>
commitment to providing the best education possible for their children, balanced with the realistic<BR>
apprehension that authorities might arrive at the door momentarily to challenge their educational<BR>
choice.<BR>

<P>With the founding of Home School Legal Defense Association ten years ago, constitutional<BR>
answers to the legal challenge found a primary voice of articulation.  Christopher J. Klicka,<BR>
HSLDA's longest standing full time employee, recalls, &quot;Families wanted to know if it was legal. <BR>
Many times I couldn't say it was, except from a constitutional perspective.&quot;<BR>

<P>A decade of experience has crystallized HSLDA's purpose through several vistas many<BR>
victorious, a few vicious, some discouraging, most invigorating.  &quot;There has been a clear shift<BR>
from the issues we were confronting in March of 1983,&quot; explains Michael P. Farris, HSLDA's<BR>
president and founder.  &quot;Back then, officials in most states would tell you that home schooling<BR>
was simply not legal.  But there has been a legislative and legal avalanche which has changed the<BR>
landscape forever.&quot; <BR>

<P>The most clear-cut victory of the past ten years is that the legality of home education is<BR>
recognized in every state of the union.  In fact, &quot;parental choice in education&quot; has become such a<BR>
prevalent theme in our society that U.S. Education Department official Michelle Easton in 1992<BR>
cited home schooling as &quot;the ultimate expression of parental choice&quot; in American families.<BR>

<P>No longer is the U.S. Constitution our sole means of defense for a parent's right to exercise the<BR>
viable alternative of home schooling.  From 1985 on, we saw a steady gain in the state legislatures<BR>
with three to four states each year changing their laws.<BR>

<P>In 1993, though some controversy remains in the eyes of a few states, no state statute actually<BR>
requires certification as a means of qualifying the home-educating parent.  A few &quot;brush fires&quot;<BR>
remain, like the problems created by Tennessee's and West Virginia's restriction of home<BR>
schooling to parents who have college degrees.<BR>

<P>A decade's track record on the legal landscape of the home education movement proves that God<BR>
has been our true advocate and protector.  By God's grace, the fear has gone away and a new<BR>
sense of confidence has set in.  Klicka comments, &quot;We know the states inside and out because we<BR>
were involved in the process of implementing so many of the changes in the laws.  We know<BR>
exactly what the new laws mean because we were involved in writing them.  We also know what<BR>
the precedents mean because we were involved in the case being won.&quot;<BR>

<P>A look into the decade ahead . . . <BR>

<P>It seems that after the &quot;age of enlightenment&quot; comes the &quot;age of regulation.&quot;  The freedom to<BR>
home educate rests upon two founda-tional principles:  the unencumbered right to practice one's<BR>
religious beliefs and the reinforcement of elements which strengthen the family unit and maintain<BR>
the structure and productivity of the home.  The foundations of these fundamental tenets in our<BR>
Constitution are beginning to come under serious and devastating attack.<BR>

<P>As society continues to move in the direction of increased government services for the family,<BR>
regulated with politically correct definitions of family relationships and social causes home<BR>
educators can expect more and more efforts to regulate our freedoms rather than the simple denial<BR>
of them altogether.  Home visits, written reports, day and hour requirements, curriculum reviews,<BR>
and more are the tools regulators may employ in this struggle to determine who is really in charge<BR>
of the children.<BR>

<P>The National Education Association (NEA) and many other groups serving the interests of public<BR>
education (such as the PTA) have openly declared their opposition to &quot;unqualified&quot; and &quot;unregu-lated&quot; parents teaching their children at home.  These are powerful political lobbying<BR>
organizations whose attitudes are clearly expressed in the words of Keith Geiger, NEA's<BR>
president, &quot;. . . quit talking about letting kids escape . . . &quot;<BR>

<P>Educationally, achievement testing is in essence the &quot;back door&quot; to curriculum control.  Testing<BR>
laws requiring home educators to demonstrate the validity of their teaching efforts through<BR>
standardized tests that do not match their curriculum objectives can become severely burdensome. <BR>
Adding the anticipated impact of Outcome-Based Education objectives on standardized testing to<BR>
this equation only compounds the threat.<BR>

<P>Furthermore, as government continues to consolidate social, educational, and healthcare reforms,<BR>
parents will experience the steady erosion of their jurisdiction to make decisions for their children. <BR>
Increasing skirmishes with child welfare agencies magnify this concern.<BR>

<P>Perhaps the most threatening specter on the horizon is the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the<BR>
Child, an international treaty which places the rights of the individual paramount to parental<BR>
concerns and judicious decisions in the child-rearing process.  Outcome-Based Education offers <BR>

<P>another all-encompassing forum for government agencies to decide how each young citizen must<BR>
think and act, along with the extensive (and intrusive) demands for who may be qualified for<BR>
college entrance or simple acceptance into the job market as an employee. <BR>

<P>The challenge of who is ultimately responsible for a child's well-being is nowhere more<BR>
pronounced than with special needs or handicapped children.  It has been HSLDA's experience<BR>
that home schooling is doubly wonderful for the special needs child.  Individualized attention is of<BR>
utmost benefit to the child with special challenges in life.  Parents occasionally coached by an<BR>
&quot;expert&quot; offer a far better alternative for many children than the route of institutionalization.  We<BR>
foresee many political and legal battles in this arena.<BR>

<P>Finally, the public outcry for &quot;some measure of accountability&quot; in response to a public education<BR>
system which is deeply flawed brings the danger that as government responds, monopolistic<BR>
control will be extended to every educational alternative.<BR>

<P>&quot;One thing we've learned for sure,&quot; says Chris Klicka, &quot;is that although we thought we could<BR>
work ourselves out of business in four or five years [when the legality of home schooling was<BR>
recognized everywhere], we'll never be able to do that until home education is no longer under<BR>
the domain of public school authorities.  As long as they are in authority over us, they will always<BR>
attempt to exceed their authority and look for ways to make it difficult, if not impossible for home<BR>
schoolers to operate.  They'll always try to intimidate us.&quot; <BR>

<P>In spite of regulatory threats, the future of the home education movement is bright!  The ranks of<BR>
home schoolers appear to be increasing by 15-20% annually, and the momentum is no where near<BR>
its peak!  State organizations many of whom are also celebrating their tenth anniversaries this<BR>
year or have already passed the decade milestone are becoming broader in their scope of<BR>
service.  In addition to providing a network of basic information and sponsoring conventions and<BR>
curriculum fairs, the state groups are organized to act legislatively, and several are beginning to<BR>
offer extensive educational services and extracurricular opportunities for older students.<BR>

<P>A flourishing home school curriculum market reveals the wealth of talent and creativity within the<BR>
movement.  New curricular packages and supplemental materials abound, expanding the<BR>
possibilities for targeting specific learning needs and enriching the overall learning environment.<BR>

<P>Technology promises another bright vista, and the possibilities of the &quot;on-line&quot; home school are<BR>
boundless.  Teaching aids, learning games, and the resources of an entire library can be just key-strokes away.  Colleges are even beginning to experiment with &quot;at home&quot; course work through<BR>
computer and video access.  Some are going so far as to offer undergraduate and graduate<BR>
degrees in addition to thought-provoking enrichment experiences.<BR>

<P>Another promising glow on the horizon is the positive perception that home schooling is gaining<BR>
in society.  Due in large measure to the obvious success of home education as evidenced in the<BR>
children, favorable media attention has also created a more accepting atmosphere.  In addition, the<BR>
ability to be creative and try new alternatives is also generating a popular swell of interest in home<BR>
schooling as society recognizes that the education establishment's methods of the last 30 years<BR>
have miserably failed.<BR>

<P>Most important of all, however, the time, energy, and loving sacrifice that we are investing in our<BR>
children is reaping rich rewards.  We are witnessing the beginning of a second generation of<BR>
home-schooling families as children who were taught at home marry and establish families of their<BR>
own.  Unencumbered by many of the educational &quot;traditions&quot; that bound their parents, the<BR>
potential for achievement for this next generation is unlimited.  We are only beginning to see the<BR>
tremendous impact that our children will have on the world, and we confidently believe that they<BR>
will be the leaders of tomorrow.  <BR>
Certainly the things in life most worth having are most worthy of our active defense.  Yes, there<BR>
will be battles, but the future is bright!<BR>

<B>                   Hard Times in North Dakota</B><BR>
HSLDA received the following letter in August 1988. It eloquently describes the fears and joys of<BR>
a home-schooling family living in North Dakota in the early 1980s.<BR>

<P>Part of my preparation for moving from San Marcos, Texas, to North Dakota, was to try and get<BR>
in touch with some home-schooling families in the Minot area. That was my first inkling of what<BR>
the situation would be like in North Dakota. I wrote to several families whose names I had<BR>
obtained from Hewitt-Moore. Without exception, ALL had either given up home schooling or<BR>
had moved to a different state. But we had no choice; the United States Air Force had given us<BR>
irrevocable orders to Minot Air Force Base.<BR>

<P>One of my letters resulted in a telephone call from the Paden family who had moved to South<BR>
Dakota where home schooling was legal. They told me who the few individuals were who had<BR>
been supportive of them in the church in Minot, but did not reveal the names of those who had<BR>
opposed them except to say that it was the church school teacher and her husband who had<BR>
turned them in to the authorities.<BR>

<P>So, in August 1983, the first week that we attended church in Minot, I almost felt as if I should be<BR>
wearing an overcoat and dark glasses! Somewhat to my alarm, a woman named Iris Severtson, a<BR>
friend of the Padens, approached us immediately and asked us over for dinner. But Mrs.<BR>
Severtson, though a public elementary school teacher, was indeed supportive of home schooling,<BR>
for she had a daughter who was doing it in another state. But we had already decided to NEVER<BR>
tell anyone else that we were home schooling.<BR>

<P>Our son Scott was below compulsory attendance age that first year. Still, people seemed to<BR>
assume that my 6 1/2-year-old son was (or should be) in first grade. So whenever anyone at<BR>
church asked, &quot;Does Scott go to school on base?&quot; I nodded affirmatively. Our home school was<BR>
definitely on the base where we lived. On base, we simply &quot;hid&quot; from our neighbors, which wasn't<BR>
too difficult to do through the North Dakota winter.<BR>

<P>I had decided that if we should get caught the following year, I would insist that Scott be allowed<BR>
to attend the elementary school downtown and be placed into Mrs. Severtson's second grade<BR>
class. But by the end of that next summer, it was evident he was nowhere ready for second grade.<BR>
He was nearly eight, but had not learned to read with our curriculum's &quot;look-say&quot; method of<BR>
teaching reading, and was still quite emotionally immature. It was then that God brought phonics<BR>
into my life, and eventually voila! decoding began to make sense to him.<BR>

<P>Thus, during the school year of 1984-85, we virtually started over with reading. I felt more<BR>
strongly than ever that it was absolutely imperative for Scott to continue being taught at home<BR>
because of what might be considered academic &quot;irregularities.&quot; <BR>

<P>At first, we were nearly too paranoid to have any contact with other North Dakota home<BR>
schoolers. But eventually we met Gerald and Sheryl Lund and others who were being prosecuted.<BR>
I attended the 1985 legislative committee hearing in Bismarck and heard the eloquent testimonies,<BR>
and I watched the proposed home-schooling bill go down in solid defeat. <BR>

<P>I soon found out about the school census that was taken every other year in North Dakota. It was<BR>
through that census of 1983 that the Lund family was &quot;caught&quot; and marked for prosecution. So<BR>
when I read the announcement of the May 1985 census in the base newspaper, I totally panicked<BR>
to the point of being physically ill, and was even led to fast with my praying.<BR>

<P>After the Lunds and the others were given guilty verdicts and began the long process of appeals, it<BR>
seemed that more and more North Dakota home schoolers came out of the woodwork, risking<BR>
and facing prosecution, court trials and guilty verdicts. It was exciting to see that persecution did<BR>
not stamp out home schooling, but watered the very seeds for its growth. Near the end, our<BR>
paranoia about not wanting people to know we even knew home schoolers had changed to a deep<BR>
friendship with Sheryl and Gerald and assisting them in their battle against the illegal tactics of the<BR>
prosecutors.<BR>

<P>But we knew we never could be as brave and open as they were. Randy was not many years away from retirement, and we just couldn't risk his entire career with a civil court prosecution. (Several years before, Randy and I had known a military family in California who had merely wanted to keep their barely six-year-old son out of school an extra year. They were nearly court-martialed over it!) During the next two years, Randy tried very hard to get orders to another base in a different state and was even willing to accept overseas orders, since we had learned that military members overseas were able to home school legally. Finally, shortly after the beginning of the1986-87 school year, Randy got an assignment to Europe to take place the following summer, so we began to relax, yet never really released our vigilant determination to never tell anyone our secret. <BR>

<P>Even though I had a pianist job at the base chapel for our last two years there, and had also<BR>
become fairly friendly with some of my own church members, I never talked about my kids'<BR>
school life. I found that people inevitably were much more willing to talk about their own kids and<BR>
their own lives, so I always directed the conversation to them, rather than us. And it seemed to<BR>
work.<BR>

<P>Of course, as my children grew older, they became more socially outgoing. Naturally, other kids<BR>
would ask, &quot;Who's your teacher?&quot; or &quot;What room are you in?&quot; or &quot;Which school do you go to?&quot;<BR>
To the kids on the base, they said, &quot;We go to a private school,&quot; and that seemed to<BR>
suffice except for the one church family who lived on base. The two youngest were Scott's and<BR>
Lisa's ages and became best friends with them. I even became good friends with their mother a<BR>
social worker who confronted me directly only once. I couldn't lie. I just told her I couldn't talk<BR>
about it and that I would tell her &quot;someday.&quot;<BR>

<P>Then a friendly neighbor let us know that they knew of our home schooling. She was neutral and<BR>
casual, but did say that all the neighbors knew.<BR>

<P>While Randy had had the assignment to Europe for several months, he did not get the official<BR>
orders until just days before we had to face the ordeal of another school census (May 1987).<BR>
However, God had plans for us that we didn't know about. Randy's orders to Europe were<BR>
canceled in July, and it seemed as if our whole world had crumpled. Then God gave us an<BR>
assignment in Texas instead a state that had had home-schooling trouble brewing for several<BR>
years, but had just won a major court victory for home schoolers in April of 1986 praise the<BR>
Lord! <BR>

<P>God taught us some major lessons in patience and trust during the months between the canceled<BR>
orders and the new orders to Texas. Because we had not moved to Europe during the summer, as<BR>
anticipated, a new school year (1987-88) was well under way, bringing its usual rash of<BR>
prosecutions of home schoolers and &quot;unapproved&quot; Christian schools throughout the state. So our<BR>
actual physical move felt something like deliverance from Egypt and entering into the borders of<BR>
Canaan. <BR>

<P>As with the Israelites' wandering in the wilderness, the entire North Dakota home-schooling<BR>
experience had a direct effect on our spiritual life, as a family, and as individual persons. God gave<BR>
me an increased understanding of my children's own unique needs. His answers to prayer were<BR>
very practical and at just the right time. And through visits to other states, He gave us optimism<BR>
and confidence that my children were progressing quite &quot;normally,&quot; while still confirming the<BR>
wisdom of our decision to home school.<BR>

<P>God rewarded my tearful struggles with the joys of watching my son reach his &quot;Integrated<BR>
Maturity Level,&quot; a point when suddenly everything seems to fit together. For Scott it happened<BR>
near the end of the third year when, at age 9 1/2, he decided he wanted to read on his own. By the<BR>
end of the next school year, he scored three grade levels above his grade level in reading! <BR>

<P>Throughout, God taught me to overcome fear (II Timothy 1:7), but not to abandon caution<BR>
(Proverbs 22:3). But it was only after we were safely in Texas (January 1988) that God revealed<BR>
to us what else He had done for us in North Dakota a situation which He in His mercy had<BR>
totally hidden from us at the time.<BR>

<P>In spite of what I initially had told people about Scott &quot;going to school on base,&quot; one of the<BR>
church members told another inquiring church member that &quot;Scott doesn't go to any school, as<BR>
far as I know.&quot; Then one of the &quot;good brethren&quot; of the church apparently felt it was their God-given duty to report to the authorities that the McDonalds were not sending their child to school.<BR>
And this all happened that first year before Scott had even reached the minimum compulsory<BR>
attendance age!<BR>

<P>So, that very first school year, a public school attendance officer called the church school to<BR>
inquire about Scott. God saw to it that the phone was not answered by the church school teacher<BR>
(whom I was sure would have turned us in), but by an individual who &quot;just happened&quot; to be at the<BR>
church and answered the school phone when the teacher and students were out on the playground<BR>
for recess! This happened, not only once, but also during our second school year that crucial<BR>
year of teaching Scott phonics.<BR>

<P>When asked, &quot;Do you know of a Scott McDonald?,&quot; this person said, &quot;Oh, yes, he's such an asset<BR>
to any school. You're not trying to 'steal' him, are you?&quot; When they didn't seem quite satisfied,<BR>
the respondent continued, describing him as &quot;bright, intelligent, and well-behaved.&quot; And, in<BR>
answer to prayer, the public school official never once asked directly, &quot;Is Scott McDonald<BR>
enrolled in your church school?&quot; <BR>

<P>Every day in North Dakota, we prayed for God to protect our home school, to send angels to<BR>
surround our apartment. Now I know truly just how, as with Daniel, my God sent His angel to<BR>
&quot;shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me.&quot; To this day I have not stopped praising God<BR>
for this miracle!<BR>
                                            Jacqueline McDonald<BR>

<P>Today, the McDonalds are living in Fort Worth, Texas.  Randy is now retired from the Air<BR>
Force.  Scott, 17 and a junior in high school, is experiencing his first year of &quot;traditional&quot;<BR>
education at a Christian boarding school.  Jacqueline reports that he is excelling academically<BR>
and socially.  Lisa is in the ninth grade of the McDonald family's home school. <BR>

<P>             <B>    Home Schooling Spells Success</B><BR>
by Michael Farris<BR>

<P><B>H</B>ome School Legal Defense Association's tenth anniversary gives me a unique opportunity to<BR>
reflect on the many blessings and challenges of a full decade. It also gives me a chance to look<BR>
ahead with vision for this organization specifically, and the movement in general.<BR>

<P><B>O</B>ur family has experienced our own version of growth over the past ten years. In 1983 we had<BR>
three children two of school age. We were finishing our first year of home schooling when I was<BR>
prompted to start HSLDA. We now have nine children and have graduated our oldest two<BR>
children.<BR>

<P><B>M</B>y motivation to start Home School Legal Defense Association came from a three-fold analysis:<BR>
(1) the home-schooling movement had a great potential for growth; (2) the education<BR>
establishment would vigorously fight this movement; (3) and traditional fund-raising methods<BR>
would not provide the solid basis needed for long-range effective defense of home schooling.<BR>
Home schooling is a different approach to education, and I wanted a different approach to<BR>
building a legal defense organization.<BR>

<P><B>E</B>ach of these points has been validated over the years. Home schooling is growing by leaps and<BR>
bounds as parents are increasingly looking for alternatives that promote good academics, common<BR>
sense morality, and family unity. Home-schooled children are the great advertisement for each of<BR>
these qualities.<BR>

<P><B>S</B>chool officials have lived up to my original expectations. Some have been fierce opponents of<BR>
home education. Some have been more or less neutral (&quot;just doing my job&quot;). Others have been<BR>
friendly and hospitable.<BR>

<P><B>C</B>hallenges tend to be remembered more than friendly interactions because of the nature of our<BR>
business. But for every nasty, difficult situation, we have six or seven that are resolved amicably.<BR>
We are constantly amazed at our successes in peaceful negotiations. This is the principal reason<BR>
(from a human perspective) that we have been able to maintain the cost of HSLDA membership at<BR>
$100.00 without a price increase in over eight years.<BR>

<P><B>H</B>owever, thousands of families have faced situations which are far from pleasant. Hundreds have<BR>
ended up in court or administrative hearings.<BR>

<P><B>O</B>ur battlegrounds have shifted around the nation. We have faced fierce or multiple legal conflicts<BR>
in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Michigan, Virginia, Iowa, Tennessee, New York,<BR>
Rhode Island, and, of course, North Dakota, just to name a few. One year it's one state that is<BR>
&quot;the worst.&quot; Another year it is some place else.<BR>

<P><B>O</B>ur success rate in defense can be attributed only to the grace of God. No HSLDA member<BR>
family has ever been forced to stop home schooling by a final court order (a few have given up<BR>
after initial losses). No child has ever been taken from their parents. No parent has ever been<BR>
sentenced to jail. We have had a few families pay fines, but then just keep on home schooling. Our<BR>
sweetest victories were the declaration of Pennsylvania and Michigan's laws to be<BR>
unconstitutional. Michigan was especially pleasing.<BR>

<P><B>L</B>egislative successes have been even more important. While HSLDA has played a supportive role<BR>
in this process, the real heroes of legislative victories are the state organizations which battle so<BR>
effectively for the rights of home schoolers in each state capital.<BR>

<P><B>L</B>egislative battles have been fought on Capitol Hill as well. And we anticipate more of these in<BR>
the future.<BR>

<P><B>E</B>ach time we speak up for home schoolers on Capitol Hill, we build a little more long-range<BR>
credibility. We have been especially effective in building good relationships on Capitol Hill by our<BR>
leadership on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.<BR>

<P><B>G</B>iven the aggressiveness of the child's rights advocates, we can expect more intense battles in the<BR>
days ahead.<BR>

<P><B>A</B>ll of our activities: court cases, legislative battles, publications, and our radio program are made<BR>
possible (again, humanly speaking) by our faithful member families. We are very, very grateful for<BR>
the 37,500 families who are current members as well as those who have ever been members of<BR>
HSLDA.<BR>

<P><B>L</B>et me also give credit to all our great staff. J. Michael Smith was the first person I approached<BR>
with the idea of HSLDA and he co-founded the organization with me. Christopher Klicka has<BR>
been with us longer than anyone else and is our top expert on home school statutes. Dewitt Black,<BR>
Jordan Lorence, and Scott Somerville are stalwarts for our members. All our attorneys are home-schooling dads.<BR>

<P><B>D</B>ouglas Phillips and Inge Cannon in the National Center for Home Education also have visibility<BR>
in the home-schooling community for their great service. Inge is our primary liaison to state<BR>
organizations. Doug is our man on Capitol Hill.<BR>

<P><B>E</B>ach of the other members of our staff do a great work on your behalf although they do not get<BR>
as much opportunity for public recognition. Our legal assistants are Pat Ramirez, Sally Cowan,<BR>
Kimberly Wray, Wanda Hebert, and Angela Yerovsek. The membership department is directed by Charles Hurst, and includes Aaron Fessler, Janet Wayne, Linda Meloy, Cora Prather, Cynthia Clapp, Katherine Polansky, Katey Ritchie, Barbara Hindman, David Gilstrap, Dennise Bly, Shari<BR>
Donaldson, and Polly Gicker. Angel Fessler completes the National Center team, and the<BR>
communications department consists of Suzanne Stephens, Darby Waters, and Jayme Farris. We<BR>
are especially proud of the home school graduates on our staff: Aaron and Angel Fessler, Dennise<BR>
Bly, Jayme Farris, and Polly Gicker.<BR>

<P><B>F</B>reedom is a fragile commodity. It must be won. It must be maintained. Freedom is not a<BR>
guarantee. It is something we earn.<BR>

<P><B>E</B>arning freedom starts with doing a good job training our children academically, socially,<BR>
spiritually, and morally. Home-schooling freedom will continue to advance so long as we continue<BR>
to pursue excellence in all that we do.<BR>

<P><B>N</B>o sacrifice is too great for the inestimable reward of children who grow up able, equipped, and<BR>
spiritually mature. Our kids are worth it. Our children receive the most precious commodity our<BR>
society has to offer our time.<BR>

<P><B>S</B>econd generation home-schooling is beginning to become more of a reality. As our children<BR>
grow up and marry others committed to home education, and as they are blessed with children,<BR>
we finally see the real fruit for which we strive. My goal is to produce children committed to<BR>
godliness, excellence, and a generational commitment to home education.<BR>

<P><B>E</B>ducation reform is a major political issue in our nation. Building up the family is another matter<BR>
of grave importance to our nation. Drug prevention, avoidance of premarital sex, and prevention<BR>
of crime all occupy the political spotlight. We may not have total solutions to all these ills, but<BR>
home education offers one sure fire method of making a positive contribution on each of these<BR>
fronts. Home education offers us an opportunity to be good parents, good citizens, and good<BR>
servants of our God. Let's excel at each task and build a legacy for the future. <BR>

              <B> Highlighting Milestones: 1983-1993</B><BR>

<P>Non-HSLDA cases are marked with an asterisk (*).<BR>

<P>1983 This year, home school statutes or regulations were adopted in Wisconsin and<BR>
Montana.<BR>

<P>March 26   Washington: Michael Farris and J. Michael Smith founded the Home School Legal<BR>
Defense Association.<BR>

<P>April 26   Wisconsin: Monumental changes were made in the Wisconsin law relating to home<BR>
education.  The state court of appeals declared the state's compulsory attendance law uncon-stitutional in Wisconsin v. Popanz.*<BR>

<P>May 18   Washington: Because they were being denied the right to educate their children, home<BR>
schoolers, led by HSLDA, challenged the constitutionality of the Washington statute when they<BR>
filed the Caproni case.  This contributed to the passage of a new home school law in 1985.   <BR>

<P>
<P>1984 This year, home school statutes or regulations were adopted in Georgia, Louisiana,<BR>
Rhode Island, and Virginia.<BR>

<P>February 23   Nebraska: Exactly three months after they had been jailed for having their children<BR>
enrolled in a Christian school, six courageous Christian men walked out of jail free.  Michael<BR>
Farris handled this case for Concerned Women for America.*<BR>

<P>August 16   Nebraska: The State Department of Education announced that parents with a<BR>
sincerely-held religious conviction against state educational standards can privately educate their<BR>
children as long as the children are taught equivalent branches of learning and are submitted to<BR>
periodic state testing.<BR>

<P>November 15   Louisiana: The State Board of Education adopted &quot;Home Study Guidelines.&quot;<BR>
The legislation stipulated that for the 1984-85 school year, all applications for home schooling<BR>

three requirements.<BR>

<P>December 19   Indiana: The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled in<BR>
favor of the Mazanec family and upheld the right of home schools to operate as private schools<BR>
saying, &quot;it is now doubtful that the requirements of a formally licensed or certified teacher . . .<BR>
would pass constitutional muster.&quot;*<BR>

<P>
<P>1985 This year, home school statutes or regulations were adopted in Arkansas, Florida,<BR>
New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington, and Wyoming.<BR>

<P>January   Kansas:  A Kansas state court dismissed all charges against Kim and Constance Jost,<BR>
who had been criminally charged with truancy for operating their home school as a private school. <BR>
The court ruled that the law was somewhat vague, but that the Josts had a legitimate school.<BR>

<P>February 18   Texas: Three of the five families from Katy, Texas, were found guilty of violating<BR>

victorious in May.<BR>

<P>February 20   North Dakota:  In the Larsen case, the State Supreme Court ruled against the<BR>

compulsory attendance law.*<BR>

<P>March 10   California: In People v. Darrah and Black, et al, the municipal court ruled that<BR>
because 48222 fails to provide fair notice or establish guidelines as to what constitutes a &quot;person<BR>
capable of teaching&quot; and what constitutes a &quot;private full-time day school,&quot; it is unconstitutionally<BR>
vague and unenforceable.<BR>

<P>June 17   Michigan: The court ruled in Haines, Smolls, Gibson v. Runkle that home schoolers<BR>
do not need to seek approval and that the state must exhaust their administrative remedies before<BR>
bringing criminal charges against families for home schooling.  David Kallman represented the<BR>
HSLDA families involved.<BR>

<P>October 22   Iowa: The Iowa Supreme Court agreed to hear HSLDA's appeal in Iowa v.<BR>

 <BR>
February 16   Maryland:  Maryland home schoolers convinced the Maryland Legislature to<BR>
remove the home visit requirement from the Department of Education's regulations.<BR>

<P>March 5   Maine:  The Maine Commissioner of Education reversed a local school board's denial<BR>
for the Dionne family, thereby allowing them to home school.  The family earlier had a truant<BR>
officer enter the home insisting on taking the children to public school until HSLDA warned him<BR>
they would bring  kidnapping charges.  <BR>

<P>March 17   Nebraska:  Nebraska home schoolers defeated L.B. 682, which would have repealed<BR>
the religious exemption provision and restored the teacher certification <BR>
requirement.    <BR>
 <BR>
March 25   Ohio:  The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the conviction of the Schmidt family in Ohio<BR>
v. Schmidt.  The Court relied on the prosecutor's version of the facts, which asserted that the<BR>
family did not exhaust their administrative remedies. The facts presented at trial, however, showed<BR>
that the Schmidts had met with the superintendent several times.  Since the record of the trial was<BR>
destroyed by the Court of Common Pleas' defective recording equipment, the Court could not<BR>
compare the prosecutor's version with the actual record.  <BR>

<P>March 26   North Dakota: Gerald and Sheryl Lund and Richard and Kathy Reimche were put on<BR>
trial again for the crime of home schooling their children.  Both were again declared guilty. <BR>

HSLDA families throughout Texas.<BR>

the approval requirement based on their First Amendment rights.<BR>

<P>June 27   Massachusetts:  The federal court found that in the case of New Life Baptist Church<BR>
Academy v. East Longmeadow School District that the district's approval process was not the<BR>
least restrictive means for ensuring the state's interest in the children's <BR>
education.*<BR>

<P>August 7   Ohio:  As a result of a dramatic turn of events in the middle of trial, in which the<BR>
superintendent testified that he had conferred with the trial judge prior to filing the complaint for<BR>
truancy, the judge ruled that Robin Diegel had not been given an opportunity for a hearing before<BR>
the superintendent, and granted HSLDA's motion for dismissal.<BR>
August 7   Rhode Island:  In Kinstead v. East Greenwich School Committee, home visits were<BR>
declared unconstitutional and removed as a requirement for approval. <BR>

<P>August 19   Iowa:  The State Supreme Court remanded Iowa v. Trucke to the district court for<BR>
dismissal, because charges against the family had been filed prematurely.  The statute requires<BR>
parents to send their children to school 120 days each year.  The Truckes were charged with<BR>
truancy 30 days into the school year, when no parent could possibly have been in compliance with<BR>
the law.<BR>

<P>September 3   North Dakota:  In North Dakota v. Melin, the judge ruled that the teacher<BR>
certification requirement was unduly burdening the Melins' religious freedom, was not necessarily<BR>
fulfilling the state's interest, and was not the least restrictive means available to the state to<BR>
preserve its interest.  Although this decision was later reversed by the State Supreme Court, it<BR>
was a surprising victory in a hostile state.<BR>
September 29   Pennsylvania:  The 11 school district superintendents in Jeffery, et al v.<BR>
O'Donnell, et al entered a motion requesting the appointment of guardians for the home-schooled<BR>
children in the case.  Federal Judge Kosik denied the motion and protected the parents' rights.<BR>

families involved in HSLDA's federal civil rights action, the judge ruled in favor of the family and<BR>
dismissed the case, saying that there were no grounds for an educational neglect verdict.<BR>

<P>May 2   Michigan:  The circuit court's ruling in Sheridan Road Baptist Church v. State,<BR>
provided the legal alternative for non-public schools (and home schools)  to use the third party<BR>
reporting procedure and thereby avoid the teacher certification requirement.*<BR>

forth a clearly defined process for notification.<BR>

<P>June 17   New York:  In the federal case Blackwelder v. Safnauer, District Court Judge Munson <BR>
ruled  that the old law was constitutional. However, because the new regulations were passed on<BR>
the same day, the negative ruling had no adverse affect on the families. <BR>

<P>June 28   North Dakota: <BR>
State v. Anderson<BR>

<P>July 19   North Dakota: <BR>
State v. Dagley  <BR>

<P>August 24   Pennsylvania: U.S. District Court Judge Edwin M. Kosik ruled in Jeffery, et al v.<BR>
O'Donnell, et al that &quot;the tutorial provision of Pennsylvania Compulsory Attendance Law . . . is<BR>
unconstitutionally vague&quot; and therefore, unenforceable.  As a result of this victory, over twenty<BR>
cases in court against HSLDA families were won or dismissed.<BR>

held, as a part of The Teaching Home's National Home School Convention.<BR>

<P>February 27   North Dakota:  Judge Dennis A. Schneider dismissed the child neglect charge of<BR>
HSLDA members Barry and Kim Fischer, and in a five-page decision ruled that simply proving<BR>
that a child is not receiving an education as required by law is not sufficient to sustain such<BR>
charges.<BR>

<P>April 7   North Dakota:  Governor George A. Sinner signed into law H.B. 1421, North<BR>
Dakota's new home-schooling law, which repeals the state's former teacher certification<BR>
requirement for all teachers.<BR>

<P>May 24   South Carolina:  Michael Farris filed Lawrence v. State Board of Education in state<BR>
court to suspend the Educational Entrance Exam (EEE) requirement for home school parents. <BR>

unconstitutional infringement upon the rights of parents to direct the education of their children.  <BR>

HSLDA appealed the case to the Michigan Supreme Court. <BR>

to their arbitrary assignment to Tier II status.  This was the first of many meetings and several<BR>
years of correspondence regarding this issue. <BR>

<P>June 22   Alabama:  HSLDA succeeded in getting a case dismissed against a home school family<BR>

Pittsburgh Superintendent Richard Wallace had issued orders requiring home-schooling families<BR>

<P>April 19   Virginia:  The Supreme Court of Virginia in Johnson v. Prince William County ruled<BR>
unanimously in favor of a home school family on the legal issues, thereby setting precedent across<BR>

family, which was subsequently granted.<BR>

      Observe therefore, all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the<BR>
strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, and so that<BR>
you may live long in the land that the Lord swore to your forefathers to give them and their<BR>
descendants . . . <BR>
      Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and<BR>
bind them on your foreheads.  Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at<BR>
home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down, and when you get up.  Write them<BR>
on the door frames of your houses and on your gates, so that your days and the days of your<BR>
children may be many in the land that the Lord swore to give your forefathers, as many as the<BR>
days that the heavens are above the earth.&quot;<BR>
                                   Deuteronomy 11:2-3; 8-9; 18-21<BR>

<P><B>Purpose:</B>     To defend and protect the constitutional right of parents to direct the education of their children.<BR>

<P><B>Explanation of Services: </B><BR>

<P>HSLDA was founded in 1983 to bring together a large number of home schooling families so that each can have a low-cost method of obtaining quality legal defense.  We give families the freedom to home school without the fear of facing legal threats alone.<BR>

<P>The vast majority of the legal threats member families face are successfully resolved through our early intervention.  For those families who do end up in court, HSLDA provides full representation at every state of legal proceedings at no cost to the family.<BR>

<P>HSLDA's efforts on behalf of home schoolers go beyond defensive actions.  We have taken offensive action in prosecuting a number of federal civil rights actions for members at no additional charge.  HSLDA has also been able to assist a number of state organizations, upon their request, with legislative battles within their home states.  Additionally, our presence in the Washington, D.C. area has enabled us to track and become involved in federal legal developments of concern to home schoolers.<BR>

<P>Each year thousands of member families received legal consultation by letter and phone, hundreds more are represented through negotiations with local officials, and dozens are represented in court proceedings.<BR>

<P>** For more information about how your family can join HSLDA, please call or write, and we will be happy to send out an application.  HSLDA also provides a number of resources and materials, including books on home schooling, synopses of state laws, home education studies and statistics, high school diplomas, and more.  You do not have to be a member to order these items or to subscribe to HSLDA's bi-monthly publication, The Home School Court Report, which tracks state and federal legislative developments, new studies and statistics, and other home education-related news.<BR>

<P>The National Center for Home Education is a sister branch of HSLDA and serves as an information clearinghouse on heom education statistics, educational choice, educational legislation, state leadership, and more.  You can reach the National Center at 540-338-7600.

<P>
<P><B>*   Quality Legal Representation.</B>  At a cost of $100 per year, HSLDA provides experienced legal counsel and representation by qualified attorneys to every member family who is challenged in the area of home schooling.  All attorneys fees and costs are paid in full directly by the Association. <BR>

<P>Legal representation as a member means tremendous savings for a family who is prosecuted for home schooling. Attorneys fees vary widely from state to state and situation to situation, but these estimated attorneys fees illustrate the significant savings our member families enjoy when legal action is taken against them:   <BR>

<P>Response to threats by local official 	 $   100<BR>
Initial court hearings 	 $1,000<BR>
Trial in court of record 	 $5,000<BR>
Representation at appellate level 	 $3,000<BR>
 <BR>
The legal representation HSLDA offers its members extends to the appellate level.  That is, if a negative decision is issued in a trial court, we will appeal the members case to the appropriate higher court at our expense.  However, we reserve the right to disapprove an appeal if the particular facts of the case make it likely that a negative precedent will damage the rights of other home schoolers.     <BR>

<P>HSLDAs service covers all defense costs as well. Typical defense costs include expert witness fees, travel costs, filing fees, and deposition costs.   Member families are responsible for the payment of any fines. HSLDA's guarantee of free legal representation does not extend to matters involving divorce, child custody, or related domestic affairs. However, HSLDA will make resources available that provide assistance in these legal matters.<BR>
  <BR>
<B>*   Court Report Subscription.</B>  Every member family receives a subscription to The Home School Court Report, a magazine focusing on legal news and other matters of concern to home schoolers.  The Court Report is published six times per year.     <BR>

<P><B>*   Satisfaction of Helping Others.</B>  Each member receives not only the guarantee of legal protection for his own family, but also the satisfaction of knowing that his membership is helping others establish their right to home school in difficult areas. Because legal precedents cross state lines, we must together maintain a national perspective in our defense of the rights of home schoolers.<BR>

<P><B>*   National Center for Home Education.</B>  To complement our work in providing legal protection for our members, HSLDA has established the National Center for Home Education. The National Center is designed to assist state home schooling organizations and their leaders by providing services that are difficult for many organizations to provide for themselves: a network for cooperation and communication between state-wide organizations; a source of information on state and federal legislation, noting proposed bills which would impact the home schooling community; and a presence in both the state and federal capitals, promoting legislation favorable to home schoolers. Armed with these resources, state organizations are better able to assist home schooling families in their own states.  Organization leaders are invited to contact the National Center for more information on the services offered. <BR>

<P>Another function of the National Center is to lobby in Washington, DC, on legislation that would affect home education and parental rights.  When we appear before legislators and legislative bodies, we represent the members of HSLDA.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>Comments from Members</B><BR>

	  Columbiana, OH<BR>

<P>Thank you so much for offering this service at such a reasonable rate. We feel so much more peaceful knowing we have Godly lawyers on our side!<BR>

<P>Thank you for your help and assurances. We feel shaky treading on new ground, and its comforting to talk with those whove been there and know the territory.<BR>
	  Chicago, IL<BR>

<P>We definitely want to renew our membership but pray that we wont have to use it. We really feel from our hearts that this money is well spent to support those who do have to use your services.<BR>
	  Hewitt, TX <BR>

<P>Thank you for sticking up for the little guys who want to do Gods will with their children.<BR>
	  Columbus OH<BR>

<P>We want to thank you for the prompt, kind, and helpful attitude HSLDA has displayed in our situation. It is good to know we have dedicated, qualified, and concerned people to go to bat for us.

	  Inyokern, CA<BR>

<P>We are glad to be a part of HSLDA and we'll do our part to encourage others to join, too!<BR>

<P><center><b>General Characteristics</center></b><BR>
<ul><li>About 700,000 to 1,150,000 United States students (grades K through 12) are home educated, and the number appears to be growing (Lines, 1991; Ray, 1992). </li><BR>
<li>Teaching specific philosophical or religious values, controlling social interactions, developing close families, and high level academics are the most common reasons for home schooling. </li><BR>
<li>One researcher (Knowles, 1988) has linked the life histories (e.g, positive or negative experiences) of parents to their rationales for home educating their own children. </li><BR>
<li>Home educators are able to be flexible and tailor the curriculum to the needs of their children.</li></ul><BR>

<P><center><b>Academics</center></b><BR>
<ul><li>A nationwide study (Ray, 1990), using a random sample of 1,516 families from one organization's membership, found home educated students to be scoring, on average, at or above the 80th percentile in all areas on standardized achievement tests. Note: The national average on standardized achievement tests is the 50th percentile. </li><BR>
<li>Wartes (1989) found that home school students in Washington consistently score at the 66th percentile on the Stanford Achievement Test, with their strongest scores in science, listening, vocabulary, and word reading. </li><BR>
<li>Home education students in Montana scored at the 72nd percentile on standardized achievement tests (Ray, 1990). </li><BR>
<li>The State of Tennessee (1988) reported that the home educated in that state averaged about the 83rd percentile in reading and about the 77th percentile in math on standardized achievement tests. </li><BR>
<li>The state of Oregon (1988) found that 73% of the home school students who were tested scored above average. Note: The national average is for 50% to score above average.</li><BR>
 <li>The research findings are consistent that the home educated do equal to or better than conventional school students on achievement tests.</li></ul><BR>

<P><center><b>Social and Emotional Adjustment</center></b><BR>
<ul><li>Dr. Johnson (1991) concluded that home educators carefully address the socialization needs of their children in every area studied (i.e., personal identity, personal destiny, values and moral development, autonomy, relationships, sexuality, and social skills). </li><BR>
<li>Studying actual observed behavior, Dr. Shyers (1992) found the home educated had significantly lower problem behavior scores than do their conventional school agemates. And the home educated have positive self-concepts. </li><BR>
<li>Dr. Taylor (1986) found that the home educated have significantly higher self concepts than those in public schools. </li><BR>
<li>The home schooled are well adjusted socially and emotionally like their private school comparison group. The home educated, however, are less peer dependent than the private school students (Delahooke, 1986). </li><BR>
<li>Dr. Montgomery (1989) found that home schooled students are just as involved in out-of-school and extracurricular activities that predict leadership in adulthood as are those in the comparison private school (that was comprised of students more involved than those in public schools).</li></ul><BR>

<center><b>General Characteristics</center></b><BR>
<ul><li>Continued growth in the home education movement parallels a simultaneous decline in the enrollment in other forms of education.(1)  About 700,000 to 1.15 million grades K-12 children are home educated during 1996-1997.(2) </li><BR>

<P><IMG src="2112_0.gif">
<P>
<P><li>Key reasons for home educating are the transmission of a distinct set of beliefs and values to children, close family relationships, controlled and positive peer social interactions, quality academics, alternative approaches to teaching and learning, and the physical safety of children.(3) </li></ul><BR>

<P><center><b>Social Responsibility and Mutual Respect</center></b><BR>
<ul><li>Patricia Lines of the U.S. Dept. of Education concluded that home education families &quot;... have not turned their backs on the broader social contract as understood at the time of the Founding [of America]. [They are] ... asserting their historic individual rights so that they may form more meaningful bonds with family and community. In doing so, they are not abdicating from the American agreement. To the contrary, they are affirming it.&quot;(4)  </li><BR>
<li>Home educators and their families are not dependent on public, tax-funded resources. (In Oregon, they appear to be saving taxpayers at least $31 million per year.(5)) Neither do they, in general, have a strong desire for access to tax-funded resources. Their children are learning well, they do not need or want more state regulation and will strongly oppose it, and the parents will not likely be coaxed into more regulation by the lure of offered services. They want to be understood and treated as people and educators of integrity.(6) </li></ul><BR>

<P><center><b> Academic Achievement </center></b><BR>
<ul><li>Dr. Howard Richman and his colleagues have found that the home educated in Pennsylvania score, on average, at the 86th percentile in reading and the 73rd percentile in math(7)  (The national average is the 50th percentile.) </li> <li>Repeatedly, across the nation, the home educated score as well as or better than those in conventional schools. </li></ul><BR>

<P><center><b>Social and Emotional Adjustment </center></b><BR>
<ul><li>Dr. Larry Shyers observed children in free play and group interaction activities. Conventionally schooled children had significantly more problem behaviors than did the home educated. This is probably because the primary models of behavior for the home educated are their parents.(8)  </li><BR>
<li>Home educated children are more mature and better socialized than are those sent to school, according to Thomas Smedley's personal interaction and communications approach to understanding socialization.(9)  </li><BR>
<li>Dr. Gary Knowles, of the University of Michigan, explored adults who were home educated. None were unemployed and none were on welfare, 94% said home education prepared them to be independent persons, 79% said it helped them interact with individuals from different levels of society, and they strongly supported the home education method.(10) </li></ul><BR>

<li>Patricia Lines of the U.S. Dept. of Education concludes: home education families &quot;... have not turned their backs on the broader social contract as understood at the time of the Founding [of America]. Like the Antifederalists, these homeschoolers are asserting their historic individual rights so that they may form more meaningful bonds with family and community. In doing so, they are not abdicating from the American agreement. To the contrary, they are affirming it.&quot;(3) </li><BR>
<li>Home education families are not dependent on public, tax-funded resources they save taxpayers many millions of dollars.(4)</li></ul><BR>

<P><center><b>                            Academic Achievement</center></b><BR>

<P><ul><li>The largest data set on the academic success of the home educated reveals positive things. 16,311 students from across the country were tested with the nationally normed Iowa Test of Basic Skills. The nationwide average for the home schooled on the Basic Battery (i.e., reading, language, and math) was the 77th percentile. They were at the 79th percentile in reading, the 73rd in language, and the 73rd in math. (The national average is the 50th percentile.) See the table on this sheet.(5) </li><BR>

<P><li>Canada's largest study of its kind revealed similar findings on the academic success of the home educated. Dr. Brian Ray found the students scoring, on average, at the 80th percentile in reading, the 76th in language, and the 79th in math. Students whose parents were certified teachers did no better than the other students.(6) </li><BR>
<li>Dr. Steven Duvall compared the academic engaged time (AET) and basic skill development of learning disabled students who were home educated to those in public school special education programs. Higher rates of AET and greater academic gains were made by the home educated. &quot;... parents, even without special education training, provided powerful instructional environments at home...&quot; (p. 11).(7)</li><BR>
<li>Repeatedly, across North America, the home educated score as well as or better, on average, than those in conventional schools.(8)</li></ul><BR>

<P><center><b>                            The Home Educated as Adults</center></b><BR>
   <Ul><li>Drs. Paulo de Oliveiro, Timothy Watson, and Joe Sutton studied Christian college-age students at a large liberal arts, Christian university. They compared three groups those who had graduated from two types of private schools and those from home schools. There were no statistically significant differences in various critical thinking skills among the student groups. That is, the home educated did as well as the others.(9)</li> <BR>
<li>Public school, conventional Christian school, and home school graduates at a large, Christian liberal arts university were examined and compared for their college academic preparedness and college academic achievement. Dr. Rhonda Galloway found that the home educated performed as well or better than the others on these measures.(10)</li> <BR>
<li>Dr. Gary Knowles, of the University of Michigan, explored adults who were home educated. None were unemployed and none were on welfare, 94% said home education prepared them to be independent persons, 79% said it helped them interact with individuals from different levels of society, and they strongly supported the home education method.(11)</li></ul><BR>

<P><H4><B>WHAT IS THE NATIONAL HOME EDUCATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE, AND WHAT CAN IT DO FOR YOU?</B></H4><P><HR><P>NHERI is the <B>National Home Education Research Institute</B>.  The institute has offices in Salem, Oregon and in Washington, DC. Dr. Brian Ray founded the institute in 1990 as a 501(c)3 non-profit research organization, and is the president of the institute. He lives in Salem, Oregon and heads up the West Coast Home Office of NHERI. Dr. Ray is responsible for doing and collecting research about home schooling, publishing the research journal called the <B>Home School Researcher</B>, and coordinating the day-to-day activities of the institute. William (Bill) Lloyd is a researcher and branch manager of NHERI's Washington DC office. Mr. Lloyd is also a statistician at the US Bureau of the Census in Suitland, MD; his duties with NHERI include working with the media on articles concerning home schooling, speaking to national and state legislators about home schooling research, and assisting Dr. Ray with his research duties.<P><B>Dr. Brian Ray</B> is perhaps the foremost expert in the country with regard to home schooling research. The institute he founded has hundreds of research works documented and catalogued on home schooling, many of which were done by NHERI. The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) was the sponsor for our 1990 study on home schooling students and their families, which is the single-most quoted research work of it's kind on this subject. We are now in the process of updating this nationwide study, and we should have a report available for public consumption by the end of 1996.<P><B>NHERI exists to do the following things</B>:<P><UL><LI>To research those who teach their children at home;<BR><LI>To publish the research journal called the <B>Home School Researcher</B>, which chronicles the current research being done about home schooling;<BR><LI>To speak to the media, legislators, and national organizations about the home schooling movement, showing factual research about those who teach their children at home;<BR><LI>To serve as conference speakers and teachers for groups interested in home schooling; and<BR><LI>To work with legislators on Capitol Hill, and with state/local legislators, on issues related to parental rights, the freedom we have to teach our children at home, and home schoolers coordinating with local school officials.</UL><P><B>Services we provide on a regular basis include</B>:<P><UL><LI>Speaking to home schooling and other types of conferences about home schooling research;<BR><LI>Giving seminars and lectures on how to teach your children at home;<BR><LI>Doing state- and national-level research about the home schooling community; and<BR><LI>Speaking to the media (television, radio, newspaper, etc.) about home schooling issues.</UL><P><BR><B>For more information about NHERI's services, to subscribe to the Home School Researcher,  to get started in your own home schooling, or if you would like to obtain information about home schooling research, you can contact the institute at the following addresses:</B><P><B>Salem, OR Home Office</B><P>Dr. Brian D.

Colors and nuances of colors stream forth from tree and herb. The radiance of crisp sunshine cuts through the dense, cold air.  Rain fills the dry creek bed and snow begins to replenish the reserve of water for next summer. I relish autumn days.<P>Early October saw Betsy and me in Dallas, Texas for the Ninth Annual National Christian Home Educators Leadership Conference. Bill Lloyd, NHERI's research associate in Washington DC, and one of NHERI's board members were also there on behalf of NHERI. It was a time of refreshment, encouragement, challenge, and exhortation. It renewed and reconfirmed to me that home education is the most excellent way to train and educate children to have minds and hearts that are as great as is possible -- and to be the nation's great, and biblical, leaders of tomorrow. Thank you for your support and the opportunity to attend this conference.<P>The activities of the conference and, more importantly, the state and national home education leaders with whom we conversed, thought, and laughed were most precious to me. They validated, repeatedly, that <I>the work of NHERI is crucial</I> to their work in their home states and in their roles as national leaders. They reminded me that the nationwide studies, the state-specific studies, the fact sheets, and the media interviews that we provide are constant supports to their hands-on work. It is their work with legislators, in the courts, with new home schoolers, with the relatives of home schoolers, and with the media that is bolstered and made strong by NHERI's research and presentations. You are a part of this.<P>NHERI has been engaged in many works since I last wrote to you. Here are some of the activities in which NHERI has been and is engaged, most of which are done on a gratis basis in order to serve home educators and the public in general. Following is <U>just part</U> of NHERI's journal from the past few months:<P>8/1/96 Lapinski, articles editor of <B><I>Child Magazine</I></B>, interviewed Dr. Ray.<P>8/8/96 Tom Hess of <B>Focus on the Family's <I>Citizen</I></B> magazine interviews Dr. Ray for home education story.<P>8/21/96  Sabine Guez, a French journalist, interviewed Dr. Ray for <B><I>Mikado</I> (a French children's magazine)</B>.<P>8/29/96 Taigi Smith of <B><I>CBS News</I></B> contacts NHERI for statistics.<P>8/30/96 Ken & Mary Jo Patterson of <B>Georgia Home Education Association</B> get research from NHERI on performance of home educated in college in order to educate state Board of Regents for policy making.<P>9/12/96 NHERI provides research to Stevan Rosenlind of <B><I>Fresno (CA) Bee</I></B> newspaper.<P>9/17/96 Jeff Archer of <B><I>Education Week</I></B> interviews Dr. Ray.<P>9/16/96 Patricia Smith of <B><I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I></B> interviews Bill Lloyd.<P>9/17/96 Jaimee Rojas of <B><I>Channel 31 KPWB Cable Television</I></B> interviews Dr. Ray for tonight's story on trends in home education.<P>9/23/96 <B><I>Focus on the Family Citizen</I></B> quotes Dr. Ray and cites NHERI's research.<P>9/25/96 David Sharp for <B><I>USA Weekend</I></B> interviews Dr. Ray.<P>9/26/96 Kate Mewhinney of <B><I>Valley Morning News</I></B> (Harlingen TX) interviews Bill Lloyd.<P>9/26/96 Steve Richards of Christian Action Research and Education from England sends e-mail: "Congratulations on the superb web site which you've established. I have no doubt that it will prove invaluable to those of us on this side of the water, as well as the large army of home schoolers in the US and Canada."<P>9/96 Roger A. Richards, Jr., in <B><I>Business Korea</I></B>, heavily cites NHERI/Ray's research and explains home education to Koreans.<P>10/4/96 <B><I>US News & World Report</I></B> interviews Bill Lloyd about computers and home schoolers.<P>10/96 Dr. Shirley M. Breshears' <B>dissertation (University of Idaho)</B> recognizes influential work of NHERI and Dr. Ray.<P>10/23/96 Dr. Ray was <B>expert witness in <I>State of Maryland v. Cheryl Anne Battles</I></B>; home schooling mother found "not guilty."<P>10/24/96 <B><I>Baltimore Sun</I></B>, on Cheryl Battles' case, quotes Dr. Ray: "My opinion is that (Battles is) providing regular and thorough instruction, . . . It's excellent when you compare it to what children get, on average, in the American public schools."<P>8/96 Currently helping several graduate students and professors in their research.<P>We released a preliminary report on the new nationwide study while at the leadership conference in Dallas. People all over America are waiting with anticipation for the final report. I will be sure to let you know when it is ready. Our projects in Indiana and Massachusetts continue. And I am talking with folks in some other states about new research projects.<P>As you can see, we are busy and your support is going a long way. Please remember that another <U>tangible</U> way that you can help is by signing up with the LifeLine long distance telephone program. It is painless and costs you nothing. (LifeLine says it is best and easiest if you just call their toll-free number and be sure to say that you are signing upunder NHERI. <B>Call 800/800-7550</B> and tell them you want to sign up under NHERI, their nonprofit account # 41656. It is a simple process and 10% of your monthly bill goes to NHERI). Remember, many long-distance carriers like AT&T are supporting causes and organizations that are antithetical to Judeo-Christian ethics and morality.<P>Remember, our World Wide Web site is now active. Go check it out if you are on-line: www.nheri.org.<P>Please let me know if there is some way that we might help you and consider how you might help us. May you be blessed with a warm autumn.<P>Sincerely,<P>Brian D. Ray, Ph.D.<BR><I>President</I><BR>

A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength; for waging war you need guidance, and for victory many advisers&quot; (Proverbs 24: 3&#173;6, NIV).<BR></FONT><P><FONT COLOR=#000000>It is a time in America when many are looking for advice, knowledge, and, ultimately, power. We know, however, that we must seek <I>wisdom</I> and that we will receive wisdom only by fearing and intimately knowing the Lord God. At the National Home Education Research Institute, we are striving to gain knowledge that can be used in the proper way for power and strength to advance the work of home schooling families according to the ways of God.  As we do this, we are enthused to see many good things happening.<BR></FONT><P><FONT COLOR=#000000>There is enthusiasm and excitement in the air at NHERI. We have just moved our office within Salem and now we can operate most of our activities from one building. (Mike Tindall, in Salem OR, and Bill Lloyd, near Washington DC, will continue doing some work from their homes for now.) A church has graciously given us the use of the upstairs of its office (which was once a parsonage). We have two large rooms and one smaller one. It is great.<BR></FONT><P><FONT COLOR=#000000>All during the move this summer, queries from people all over the United States and other countries have continued to pour in to NHERI. Many are parents who want hard facts about home education before they make the commitment to do so with their children. Others are reporters from many media outlets (see the listing below). Some are parents in court cases related to home schooling. And others are, of course, researchers  professors and graduate students doing academic research, home schooling adults taking a course at a local college, and home educated students writing letters to the editor. Much is happening and I can sense the activity rise as the conventional school year draws closer.<BR></FONT><P><FONT COLOR=#000000>NHERI has been engaged in many works since I last wrote to you. </FONT>Here are some of the activities in which NHERI has been and is engaged, most of which are done on a <I>gratis</I> basis in order to serve home educators and the public in general.

We recently moved our office to a different location in Salem, Oregon. Some of our immediate needs are as follow:<P>1. Filing cabinet, four-drawer with hanging file hardware ($107).<P>2. A tape backup system for the computer systems (several hundred dollars)  data are crucial to NHERI's operation.<P>3. Set-up fees for an Internet domain and domain name, e-mail services, and Internet access ($600).<P>4. One or two new office desks/computer workstations (about $200 each).<P>5. Set-up fees for phone line installation and telephones ($235).<P>6. Call detector device for routing different types of phone calls (e.g., voice, fax, data) ($100).<P>7. Materials for home-built bookshelves in Dr. Ray's office ($250).<P>8. Office suite software for three computer systems ($330).<P>9. Paint for the office ($25).<P>10.

NHERI cannot keep abreast of all of the requests for information and services due to our lack of personnel.<P>12. Funding for part-time or full-time secretarial staff.<P>13. Prayer regarding the LifeLine fund-raising program. And, <B>you could help in a <U>tangible</U> way by signing up. It is painless and costs you nothing. (LifeLine says it is best and easiest if you just call their toll-free number and be sure to say that you are signing up under NHERI.)</B> Remember, many long-distance carriers like AT&amp;T are supporting causes and organizations that are antithetical to Judeo-Christian ethics and morality.<P>14.

The Lloyd family was featured in a television show on Maryland Public TV that focused on home schooling. Bill recently received a videotape from the producers of Lifestyle Magazine, a nationally-syndicated talk show.  Bill appeared on Lifestyle Magazine in May 1996, and was the home school research expert in that show, representing NHERI.

<P>Dear Friends,<BR>

<P>You have heard of the rain in Oregon in the winter it is true, and it is happening. This moisture, however, is what keeps it verdant here all year round and I thank our sovereign God for that. We like it that way.<BR>

<P>I would like you to know a little about what NHERI is doing these days, and apprise you of what may lie ahead. The nationwide study is progressing well; the questionnaire should be mailed out within three weeks to thousands of home education families. The Massachusetts study is progressing well. A large, home education membership organization has contracted NHERI to help them in a member survey, and NHERI will begin receiving those questionnaires this week in order to begin data entry. In addition, in terms of research projects, several statewide organizations or groups thereof are talking with NHERI about doing studies.<BR>

<P>This is all very good, and it is helpful to families and to the United States in general. In fact, the research that we do here ends up helping people all over the world. I know, because they contact NHERI on a regular basis to obtain research findings and then they tell me about what good it has done for them in their countries.<BR>

<P>Here are some of the activities in which NHERI is engaged, most of which are done on a volunteer, gratis basis in order to serve home educators and the public in general. Following is part of NHERI's journal from the past few months:<BR>

If you have any questions or comments about the activities that I have just mentioned, let me know.<BR>

<P>I would like you to know about some of the clear blessings that have been recently bestowed upon NHERI:<BR>
<ol><li>Mr. William Lloyd, better known as Bill (and mentioned above), has enthusiastically jumped into volunteer service for NHERI. I met Bill about seven years ago in Seattle where he was my neighbor. There is a lot to the story; suffice it to say, Bill has a great grasp of research methodology, a love for the Lord and home education, has a graduate degree, works for the United States Bureau of the Census, and has many talents.<BR>
<li>Bill Lloyd and Clark Greer, a friend in California, are creating a home page for NHERI on the World Wide Web on the Internet.<BR>
<li>Bill Lloyd is taking on many media interviews for NHERI and me.<BR>
<li>A statewide home education organization just contributed enough money for NHERI to purchase a needed new computer monitor.<BR>
<li>A large home education organization just contributed a needed new HP LaserJet 4 Plus printer to NHERI.</ol><BR>

<P>Here are some of NHERI's current needs:<BR>
<ol><li>Funding for a full-time business manager. NHERI has many opportunities to serve home educators, do research, and inform the public. NHERI has had to turn away many requests for information and services due to our lack of personnel. You might know that NHERI has no full-time employees and we sorely need at least one to keep NHERI's many activities streamlined and the services flowing to home educators, researchers, and the public. Mike Tindall, a home schooling father, continues to work for NHERI on a part-time, sometimes-paid basis. We would truly like to fund a full-time position for him.<BR>
<li>Funding for a part-time or full-time secretary (see situation in #1 above).<BR>
<li>Prayer regarding the development of an internship position at NHERI.<BR>
<li>Prayer regarding a &quot;perpetual&quot; fund-raising program that NHERI is pursuing.<BR>
<li>Prayer regarding some request-for-funding proposals that a friend of NHERI plans to distribute for NHERI to potential benefactors.</ol><BR>

<P>If you believe that you should help NHERI in any way, please do.<BR>

<P>I thank the Lord God continually for your personal encouragement, your tangible help in the form of financial contributions, and for your prayerful intercession on behalf of what we are trying to do through NHERI.  May the Lord bless you and your family and friends at this very special time of the year.<BR>

<P>Most Warmly,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Brian D. Ray, Ph.D.<BR>

<P><center>Abstract</center><BR>

<P>The purpose of this descriptive and correlational study was to collect basic information about home education families and children throughout Canada. The topics addressed were (a) demographics, (b) selected educational characteristics of the families, (c) educational and post-secondary school characteristics of the students, (d) academic achievement of the students, (e) relationships between their academic achievement and factors such as educational attainment of parents, family income, and pedagogical practices, and (f) the relationship between selected physical and mental limitations and pedagogical practices.<BR>

<P>In general, the parents had somewhat higher educational attainment than the general population in Canada, and their total family income was 83% of that of all husband-wife families in Canada. Fourteen percent of the mothers worked outside the home for an average of 11.9 hours per week. The families had notably more children (3.5) than the national average. Mothers did 88% of the formal instruction of their children, while fathers did 9% of the formal instruction. They used a wide variety of curriculum materials, made regular use of libraries, and engaged their children in numerous social activities.<BR>

<P>The students scored, on the average, at relatively high percentiles on standardized academic achievement tests: (a) total reading, 80th, (b) total listening, 84th, (c) total language, 76th, (d) total math, 79th, (e) science, 82nd, (f) social studies, 81st, (g) basic battery (reading, language, and mathematics), 79th, and (h) complete battery (all subject areas in which student was tested), 82nd.<BR>

<P>None of the following variables explained a significant amount of variance in the students' total mathematics, total listening, science, and social studies scores: formal educational attainment of the parents, teacher certification status of the parents, family income, number of years the student was home educated, degree of structure in the home education environment, age of the student, time spent in formal education activities, age at which formal education commenced, gender of the student, extent to which the family uses public libraries, and amount of money spent on the home education of the child. Father's educational attainment was a significant predictor of reading and language scores, and the longer a child had been home educated, the better was his language score. Both variables were only weak to moderately strong predictors.<BR>

<P>None of the following variables explained a significant amount of variance in the students' farsightedness:  degree of structure in the learning environment, time spent in structured learning, and age at which formal instruction commenced.  Time in structured learning was a weak predictor of nea&yuml;sightedness, and age at which formal instruction began was a weak predictor of attention deficit disorder.<BR>

  <BR>
The purpose of this descriptive and correlational study was to examine, regarding home education families and their children throughout Montana, (a) demographics, (b) selected educational characteristics of the families and students, (c) academic achievement of the students, and (d) relationships between their academic achievement and various factors.<BR>
    <BR>
In general, these home educating parents had somewhat higher than average educational attainment. The annual family income (median of $30,000) was similar to (or slightly lower than) that of all married couple families in Montana. These families were much larger than average for Montana, with 3.2 children per family. Families spent $329 per year to home educate each child.<BR>
    <BR>
The mother did 87% of the formal teaching of the children while the father did 11% of the teaching. The large majority of these children were not being taught by professionally trained and government certified teachers.<BR>
 <BR>
On average, the children had been taught at home for 4.2 years since age 5, 54% were in grades K through 5, and their parents generally planned to home educate them through their secondary school years. Curriculum materials were hand picked, rather than being purchased complete programs, by parents for 68% of the students. The social activities of these home educated children were quite varied. For example, 56% were involved in group sports, 85% were in Sunday school, 54% were involved in music classes, 55% took other classes with students outside of the home, and 96% engaged in play activities with people outside of the family.<BR>
<BR>
These students scored, on the average, at relatively high percentiles on standardized academic achievement tests: (a) total reading, 75th, (b) total listening, 73rd, (c) total language, 63rd, (d) total math, 67th, (e) science, 77nd, (f) social studies, 75th, (g) basic battery (reading, language, and mathematics), 70th, and (h) complete battery (all subject areas in which student was tested), 73rd.<BR>
  <BR>
Several predictor variables (i.e., father's educational attainment, father's teacher certification status, family income, number of children in the family, years child was home educated, presence of a computer in the home, and amount of money spent on home education) were not significant in explaining variance in any of the testing areas.<BR>
<BR>
Mother's educational attainment, structure in the teaching and learning environment, gender of student, mother's teacher certification status, and use of libraries did, in some categories, serve as significant predictors of academic achievement. These variables, however, were generally relatively weak in their ability to explain variation in scores. Very few factors, that at first seem important, appear to be able to predict the academic achievement of the home educated. This and other studies indicate that very few background variables explain the academic achievement of the home educated, and it is possible that the home education environment eliminates the effect, in a positive way, of many variables which could reasonably be expected to affect achievement.

<P><center>ABSTRACT</center><BR>
<BR>
The purpose of this study was to collect basic and factual information about home educators and their students in North Dakota in order to build an understanding of them. More specifically, the objectives of this study were to answer questions about (a) demographic characteristics of home education families, (b) selected significant characteristics of North Dakota home schools, (c) student performance on standardized achievement tests, (d) the relationship between student achievement and various factors related to their education, and (e) changes in data from the previous year.<BR>
     <BR>
One hundred-four home education families and 195 students were examined.  The average formal education of the primary parent was 14.5 years; it was 15.3 years for the other parent. The median annual family income was $25,450. The average age of the students was 10.3, with the average grade level being 4.3. Forty-eight percent of the students were male. Students were engaged in formal schooling 19.7 hours per week, and the religious content of the curriculum was relatively strong. The most common ways the parent qualified to teach in North Dakota were by either having a high school degree and being monitored by a certified teacher or having passed the National Teacher Examination (NTE) and not being monitored; the third most common way was by being a certified teacher. The large majority of parents expressed that they neither needed nor wanted their children to be monitored by certified teachers.<BR>
<BR>
The students scored, on the average, at the following percentiles on standardized achievement tests: (a) total reading, 86th, (b) total listening, 81st, (c) total language, 85th, (d) total math, 83rd, (e) science, 87th, (f) social studies, 84th, (g) basic battery (reading, language, mathematics), 84th, and (h) complete battery (all areas tested), 87th. The national average is the 50th percentile. There were low statistical relationships between students' basic battery scores and the number of years home educated and the degree of handicap of the student. There were no significant relationships between basic battery achievement and several variables (i.e., parent scores on the NTE, family income, educational attainment of parents, religious content of curriculum, hours formal instruction per week, degree of structure in learning environment, and student's age, mental ability, and birth order). There were significant relationships of varying strengths between complete battery scores and educational attainment of the parents and student's mental ability, degree of handicap, and years home educated. The provision of the law under which the supervising parent qualified to operate a home school had no significant effect on basic battery achievement scores.  The only significant gender difference in achievement was that girls outscored boys in language. Further, there were no significant differences in basic battery and complete battery achievement scores between students who were monitored by local public school districts versus students monitored by state-approved private schools.<BR>
<BR>
Findings from this research and other investigations indicate that laws and regulations promoted by various organizations and states are not always based on fact and cogent reasoning. Conscientious evaluation of research findings and straightforward consideration of educational philosophies will assist in developing policy that meets the compelling interest of the state as parents work to successfully educate their children.<BR>

<P><center>Abstract</center><BR>

<P>The purpose of this study was to collect basic information about home educators and their students, their children, in the state of Oklahoma. The information might be used to build an accurate understanding of home education in Oklahoma. The study aimed to answer the following questions:<BR>
<ol><li>What are the demographic characteristics of home education families in Oklahoma?<BR>
<li>What are some of the pertinent characteristics of Oklahoma home schools?<BR>
<li>What are the academic learning outcomes (or academic achievement) of students educated at home in Oklahoma?<BR>
<li>What is the relationship between these students' academic learning outcomes (or academic achievement) and the following variables: (a) parent education level, (b) whether parents had been certified teachers, (c) family income, (d) whether religious beliefs were part of the rationale for participating in home education, (e) age of student, (f) gender of student, (g) race (or ethnic group) of student, (h) number of years student had been home educated, (i) hours of formal education in which the student was involved, (j) frequency of visits to libraries, (k) number of children in the family, and (l) amount of money the family spent on the child's home education. Alpha was set at .05 for tests of significance.</ol><BR>
<BR>
Two hundred fourteen families and 509 children were involved in this study. The median family income category in this study was $35,000-$49,999. The  formal education attainment of parents in this study was 2 or 3 years of college. At least four years of college were completed by 51.2% of the fathers and by 43.1% of the mothers. The vast majority (96% of the fathers and 99% of the mothers) reported they were &quot;born again&quot; in a Christian sense. Religious beliefs were part of the rationale for home schooling for 98% of these families. <BR>
     <BR>
Students in this study were similar to those in other home education research. There were approximately equal numbers of males and females. Grades 1 through 8 included 78.4% of the students in this study, while 65% were in grades 1 through 5.<BR>
     <BR>
The home educated students in this study scored, on the average, at or above the 82nd percentile in all areas tested (i.e., reading, listening, language, math, science, basic battery, and complete battery), with a high at the 89th percentile on the complete battery. These scores are largely consistent with, yet somewhat higher than, scores found in other home education research.<BR>
<BR>
Unexpectedly, there was no significant relationship between the formal education level of the parents and the academic achievement scores of their students. On the other hand, and contrary to the hypotheses, whether a student was a male and how long a student had been home educated were significantly and positively related to science achievement scores. These two variables, however, together explained only 3% of the variation in science scores. Also contrary to the hypotheses, the two variables of whether students' families were in the highest income category and whether they were not in one of the most common racial/ethnic categories were significantly and positively related to listening achievement scores. Again, however, these two variables together explained only 2% of the variation in listening scores.<BR>
     <BR>
As hypothesized, there were no significant relationships between student learning, as measured by standardized achievement tests, and the variables of (b), (d), (e), (i), (j), (k), and (l) listed above.<BR>
    <BR>
It is noteworthy that none of the examined variables explained significant amounts of variance in basic battery scores. This was not expected.<BR>
     <BR>
These findings, and those of other research, suggest that states and other political or educational entities need to consider factual information (such as that from this and other studies) on home education and the learning of its students as they develop policy and strive to serve home education families.<BR>

<P>This study analyzes standardized achievement scores of the home educated, and provides extensive demographic data and limited legal information in the largest nationwide study to date. It samples from the membership of the Home School Legal Defense Association. Students score, on average, at or above the 80th percentile in all subject areas; this is well above the national average of conventional school students. Student achievement is not related to whether the parents are certified teachers, in some cases is slightly related to parents' education level and family income, and is above average regardless of the degree of regulation in a given state.<BR>

<TITLE>Welcome from the IGARSS '94 Co-Chairmen</TITLE>
<H1>Welcome from the IGARSS '94 Co-Chairmen</H1>
<P>The staff at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory would like to welcome you
to Pasadena and the 1994 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing
Symposium (IGARSS'94).  IGARSS'94 is jointly sponsored by the Institute
of Electrical and Electronic Engineers' (IEEE) Geoscience and Remote
Sensing Society (GRSS), the International Union of Radio Science (URSI),
and, for the first time, the Optical Society of America (OSA).  We are
also fortunate to have the California Space Institute as a participant
this year. 
</P>
<P>The theme this year, "Surface and Atmospheric Remote Sensing:
Technologies, Data Analysis, and Interpretation," reflects the need to
view the Earth as a system of interrelated atmospheric, terrestrial, and
oceanic processes.  We would like to thank the technical chairmen Drs.
Eni Njoku, Robert Menzies, and Jurgen Richter for their time and
expertise in defining and developing our extensive technical program. 
Their efforts have resulted in nearly 1000 technical papers, an IGARSS
record.
</P>
<P>We hope you will visit "The User's Guide to the Data," an
interactive series of exhibits, hands-on demonstrations, and
presentations on the latest in data analysis and visualization.  A
number of recent data sets will be featured over the course of the
exhibit.  Also, this year marks the first time that the IGARSS Digest is
available on CD-ROM; we hope this provides a welcome change from the
still-available book format.</P> 
<P>We also look forward to seeing you at the annual baseball and soccer
games.  Take some time to enjoy Old Pasadena,the surrounding
entertainment centers, the dynamic natural "wonders,"  and the pleasant
ocean and beaches during your visit to Southern California!</P>

<TITLE>Message from Symposium Technical Chairmen</TITLE>
<H1>Message from Symposium Technical Chairmen</H1>
<P>The Technical Program for IGARSS'94 reflects the symposium theme -
"Surface and Atmospheric Remote Sensing: Technologies, Data Analysis and
Interpretation."  The program includes papers covering a wide spectrum
of research in remote sensing science and techniques in the traditional
Earth science disciplines of oceans, atmospheres, land, and cryosphere. 
Also well represented are papers on topics of special interest to
membership of the sponsoring societies: the IEEE Geoscience and Remote
Sensing Society, the Optical Society of America, and the International
Union of Radio Science.  To achieve balance in the program,
approximately half of the technical sessions were organized as special
sessions comprising both invited and contributed papers.  In addition,
three plenary sessions were organized to highlight the integrating theme
of the symposium.  The first plenary session on Linkage Between Earth
System Modeling and Remote Sensing provides perspectives on the need for
global and long-term observations in understanding the Earth's diverse
geophysical processes.  The second plenary on New Developments in Remote
Sensing Systems and Technologies presents some key trends shaping future
applications of remote sensing.  A third plenary, Policy Forum: Issues
of Mission Coordination and Data Availability, focuses on how remote
sensing missions and data are being coordinated at the international
level, and how this affects opportunities for new science and
applications.  Also included in the program are sessions on results from
recent space missions and previews of future missions.  In its breadth
and depth this promises to be a very exciting symposium indeed!
</P> 
<P>The response to the IGARSS'94 Call for Papers was overwhelming.  The
Technical Committee faced difficult choices in paper allocations and,
unfortunately, not all submissions could be accommodated.  In all, the
full program consists of 70 technical sessions and 30 interactive
sessions for a total of approximately 1000 papers.  Special thanks are
due to the members of the Technical Program Committee, and to the
organizers of the special sessions and plenaries who devoted
considerable effort to ensuring the high quality of the solicited
papers.</P>

<TITLE>MESSAGE FROM IEEE/GRSS PRESIDENT</TITLE> 
<H1>MESSAGE FROM IEEE/GRSS PRESIDENT</H1>       
<P>On behalf of the IEEE/Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society, I would
like to welcome you to the 1994 International Geoscience and Remote
Sensing Symposium (IGARSSU94).</P>       
<P>  I encourage you to participate in the exchange of technical
information in the form of oral and extended interactive presentations,
and to also take advantage of the informal discussion opportunities
throughout the week -- among these are the reception and banquet to be
held Monday and Wednesday evenings, respectively. New this year is the
opportunity for you to assist in formatting and supporting the SocietyUs
technical positions on issues of concern to the membership through the
IEEE/GRSS Technical Committees. Under the leadership of Chuck Luther,
Office of Naval Research, the first Technical Committee meeting will be
held Wednesday from 12:10 to 1:40 pm in the East-West Room of CaltechUs
Athenaeum -- lunch will be provided at a minimal charge of $10.00 per
person (tickets should be purchased in advance at the registration
desk). Your participation is important to us and to the direction of our
Society.
</P>       
<P> I extend a special welcome to all our international participants
who comprise an outstanding 50% of attendees. Our Society is well
recognized in the IEEE for its broad international participation. I
encourage all fellow IGARSS attendees to continue in your participation.
The next few years will bring the introduction of new and exciting
directions for GRSS and IGARSS. In particular, with IGARSSU94 we have
seen the introduction of Digest materials available in CD ROM format
(eliminating the need for extra luggage to take home bulky volumes).
This practice will continue with IGARSSU95 along with the submission of
abstracts via electronic mail, and IGARSSU96 will introduce an annual
commercial tradeshow to be held in conjunction with IGARSS.          You
will find in your registration packet an extensive evaluation form
covering all aspects of the symposium. Please take a few minutes to
complete this questionnaire -- it will assist future organizing teams to
better respond to your preferences.
</P>        
<P>Finally, we would like to thank JoBea Way, Dan McCleese and the
entire IGARSSU94 Organizing and Technical Committees for all the effort
put forward in organizing an outstanding, well-rounded program.</P>     
   
<P>Again, welcome to sunny Southern California! Enjoy your stay.

<P>In recent years there has been a proliferation of spaceborne system
remote sensing capabilities among the world's spacefaring nations. At
the same time budgetary and political considerations are encouraging new
perspectives on the opportunities for sharing of remote sensing
instruments, platforms, and data across institutional and national
boundaries. The need for global observations and international
scientific participation in addressing critical issues of global
environmental change is also a key factor in fostering the new
perspectives. This session will provide an opportunity for brief remarks
by a panel of experts, and for  audience interactive participation, on a
wide range of topics including instrument development, mission planning,
data availability, pricing and distribution, and research collaboration.

<TITLE>Welcome to the IGARSS '94 Electronic Digest.</TITLE>
<H1>Welcome to the IGARSS '94 Electronic Digest.</H1>
<HR>
<UL><LI><A HREF="#disclaim">Disclaimers</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#access">Accessing the IGARSS '94 Digest</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#who">Who to Contact</A></LI></UL>      
<HR><A NAME="disclaim"></A>
<H2>Disclaimers</H2>
<P><B>First:</B> All users of this CD-ROM should  understand that the
resolution of the printed page is far higher than that of a computer
screen.  Our endeavor is to scrunch 2400 pixel by 3300 pixel printed
pages onto a video display which will usually have a resolution of 480
pixels  by 640 pixels.  It is impossible to do this in a really
satisfactory manner.  Therefore the goal is to provide enough of a view
of the papers on the screen to determine that a page or article should
be printed on a higher resolution device.
</P>     
<P><B>Second:</B> Scanning hardcopy pages has several technical
problems.  A page of mixed text and gray scale imagery presents a
formidable challenge to existing scanners.  An optimum text scan yields
poor images, an optimum gray scale scan yields poor text and line art. 
Adding color graphics or color images exacerbates the problem.  This
electronic digest contains optimum text scans, sometimes appearing with
a black border around the edges.</P>
<P><B>Third:</B> You will sometimes notice that a paper title within
an abstract does not exactly match the title listed in the session
referring to that paper.  This anomaly exists because hardcopy abstracts
were scanned months in advance and some authors changed their titles
after submitting those original abstracts.</P>
<A NAME="access"></A>
<H2>Accessing the IGARSS '94 Digest</H2>
<P>This CD-ROM has several access paths for different users. If you are
not an experienced computer user, you will probably want to install the
Adobe Acrobat(TM) Reader and open the IGARSS.PDF file which is located
in the root directory of the CD-ROM.  This file provides the table of
contents and all papers in one form or another.  Limited text search
capabilities are available with the IGARSS.PDF version.</P>     
<P> If you are a more experienced computer user, you may want to
install both NCSA's Mosaic and the Adobe Acrobat(TM) Reader, and open
the IGARSS.HTM file which is located in the root directory of the
CD-ROM.  Read the appropriate AAREADME file for your platform
(AAREADME.MAC (<A HREF="mcreadme.htm">Macintosh</A>), AAREADME.UNX (<A HREF="uxreadme.htm"
>Unix</A>), AAREADME.PC  (<A HREF="pcreadme.htm">Windows PC</A>)). 
Also, please read 
<A HREF="aboutcd.htm">About the IGARSS `94 CD</A>. The NCSA Mosaic
version provides a hypertext interface for browsing papers and abstracts
via session, author, and topic.  This version also gives you the ability
to view image files and additional information supplied by the authors.

</P></LI> 
</UL>
<A NAME="mosaic"></A>
<H2>Using the Hypertext Interface - NCSA's Mosaic</H2>
<P>NCSA's Mosaic is a World Wide Web client which provides a hypertext
user interface to HyperText Markup Language (HTML) files, as well as
other file types.  Depending on the file type, Mosaic will either
display it appropriately, such as HTML or plain text, or launch an
external viewer such as xv, Adobe Acrobat(TM) Reader, etc.
</P>
<P>Words, phrases, or images which are <A HREF="aboutcd.htm">hot</A>
are hyperlinks and will be underlined, highlighted, or both.   Clicking
on a hyperlink will activate it.  Once it has been activated, it will
display in a different or subdued color, depending on your  Mosaic
client.
</P>
<P>When you choose a paper title from any of the methods listed above,
the abstract will be displayed to you.  From here, you can choose a
hyperlink to view the paper (see the next section) and/or any of its
attached materials. </P>
<P>Within Mosaic, you may search for a string within any currently
displayed document by selecting Find In Current from the File menu.
(Typing an s often gives you access to this capability.)  If you are
presented with a long list of paper titles, you may want to  use this
capability to locate a particular paper.
</P>
<A NAME="adobe"></A>
<H2>Using the Adobe Acrobat(TM) Reader</H2>
<P>If a paper is available in Portable Document Format (PDF), you will
see the following display when viewing its abstract.  </P>
<HR><IMG  WIDTH=303 HEIGHT=126 SRC="vwpaper.gif">
<HR>
<P>Clicking on this hyperlink will launch Adobe Acrobat(TM) Reader.
</P>
<HR><IMG  WIDTH=692 HEIGHT=68 SRC="acroicon.gif">
<HR>
<P>Once in Acrobat, you may use the icons and options  to view the
pages of an individual paper.  You may enlarge or reduce the size of the
page on your screen, using the + and - icons, view thumbnail images of
the pages, move from one page to the next, or print the paper.  (Be sure
to specify that you want the page to "scale to fit.")
</P>
<P>Some PDF files may have embedded hypertext links that will take you
to other pages in that same PDF file.  Click on these links to make the
hypertext jump.  They look like the following.</P>
<HR><IMG  WIDTH=165 HEIGHT=60 SRC="acrolink.gif">
<HR>
<P><EM>Papers will look and display differently depending on their</EM>

<A HREF="convhist.htm">conversion history</A>.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Papers that were converted directly from Postscript files using
Adobe's Distiller may load more slowly, but will display  images better.
</LI>
<LI>Papers that were scanned from hardcopy will lose grayscale and will
only display black and white.  These may also display artifacts from the
scanning process. 
</LI>
<LI>Papers that were submitted as Postscript files but could not be
converted directly using Adobe's Distiller, will lose grayscale and will
only display black and white.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Exit Adobe Acrobat (TM) from the File menu to return to NCSA Mosaic.</P>
<A NAME="attach"></A>
<H2>Viewing Attachments provided by the Author</H2>
<P>If there is a list of attached materials, you will see the following
type of display.  Note the icons for viewing images and non-image files.</P>
<HR><IMG  WIDTH=268 HEIGHT=200 SRC="attach.gif">
<HR>
<P> If you select an image, you must have an image display program on
your local machine to display them.  NCSA Mosaic will try and launch
certain default image display programs based on your platform.  If you
need to change these defaults to launch the program of your choice, this
can be done by:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Selecting the Options/Helper Applications menu on the Mac
</LI>
<LI>Updating the .mailcap and .mime.types files on Unix platforms
</LI>
<LI>Updating the mosaic.ini file on the PC
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Once an image display program has been launched, you must exit this
program to return to NCSA Mosaic.  Otherwise, you may experience memory
problems (especially Mac users).  In some cases, you must click on the
image to activate the menu of the display program.</P>
