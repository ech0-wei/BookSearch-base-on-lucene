<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
THE EXPLOITATION OF DRUGS FOR PROFIT AND FOR REVENUE; 
the re-discovery of their vision-inducing qualities; and the impact of scientific
advances provided three separate, though sometimes inter-locking,
strands during the nineteenth century. There was also a fourth,
of a rather different nature; the mounting campaign to have alcohol
categorised as a dangerous drug, and banned from general consumption.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The gin plague had compelled recognition of the dangers of 'ardent
spirits' as they were commonly described, and though it had been
realised that prohibition did not work, and licensing did, a widespread
belief remained&#151;particularly among the followers of Wesley,
and in the Evangelical movement&#151;that ways should be found to
reduce consumption still further. As spirits were obviously an
acquired taste, the simplest way to deal with them would be to
check the process by which the taste was acquired; and it was
with this in mind that a campaign began against tobacco.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The weed</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The arguments used were similar to those which had been employed
against hashish in Moslem countries&#151;and to those which were
to be employed against beer, and later against cannabis. Tobacco
was condemned on various grounds, as unhealthy and as anti-social;
but the main ground of criticism was that, though smoking might
be relatively harmless when indulged in moderation, it led on
inexorably not merely to excess, and addiction, but also to the
consumption of 'hard' liquor. This was the theme of a treatise
published in America in 1798: <I>Observations upon the influence
of the habitual use of tobacco upon health, morals and property,</I>
by the formidable Dr. Benjamin Rush&#151;one of the signatories to
the Declaration of Independence. Tobacco's influence on all three,
Rush felt, was pernicious; and its most sinister feature was that
the usual consequence of smoking or chewing was thirst.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This thirst cannot be allayed by water, for no sedative or even
insipid liquor will be relished after the mouth and throat have
been exposed to the stimulus of the smoke, or juice, of tobacco.
A desire of course is excited for strong drinks, which when taken
between meals soon lead to intemperance and drunkenness. One of
the greatest sots I ever knew acquired a love for ardent spirits
by swallowing cuds of tobacco, contrary to the commands of his
father. He died of dropsy under my care.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Rush's denunciation helped to promote an alliance between the
anti-tobacco campaigners and the temperance movement, when it
got under way a quarter of a century later. 'Rum drinking will
not cease', the Rev. Orin Fowler prophesied in 1833, 'till tobacco-chewing,
and tobacco-smoking, and snuff-taking shall cease'; and he went
on to estimate that at least a tenth of the drunkards in the United
States and throughout the world were made so by the use of tobacco&#151;a
piece of guesswork which was picked up and repeated again and
again until, as Joseph Robert complained in his history of tobacco
in America, it became a 'sort of sanctified census'. Other campaigners
traced the route by which an innocent youth would be lured to
perdition: having smoked, he would naturally resort to a soda
fountain, from which it was an easy step 'to beer, and then brandy,
and finally whiskey'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Tobacco was also attacked in the mid-nineteenth century as a dangerous
drug in its own right, causing&#151;Dr. Joel Shew alleged&#151;a wide
variety of disorders, including insanity, delirium tremens, and
epilepsy. He accused it of causing impotence, too; but this was
a minority view. The more general opinion among its detractors
was that it represented a threat to American womanhood. 'No man
can be virtuous as a companion', the eugenicist Orson S. Fowler
claimed,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
who eats tobacco; for, although he may not violate the seventh
commandment, yet the feverish state of the system which it produces
necessarily causes a craving and lustful exercise of amativeness.
Just as alcoholic liquors cause such amatory cravings, and for
the same reason. As alcoholic liquors and the grosser forms of
sensuality are twin sisters, so tobacco-eating and devilry are
both one; because the fierce passions of many tobacco chewers,
as regards the other sex, are immensely increased by the fires
kindled in their systems, and of course in their cerebellums,
by tobacco excitement. Ye who would be pure in your love instinct,
cast this sensualising fire from you.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Such denunciations of tobacco continued to appear until the Civil
War. Then, the armies in the field demanded to be kept supplied
with it; on the Confederate side, the soldiers had eventually
to be provided with a ration. Hope of having tobacco banned on
the ground of its moral and physical effects dwindled. Restrictions
continued to be called for, but mainly to protect the public from
the anti-social side-effects, rather than to protect the smoker
from the consequences of his vice.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In Britain tobacco was assailed on a more serious clinical level,
in the pages of the <I>Lancet.</I> After a few weeks of vigorous
controversy, an editorial in April, 1847 had to admit that though
tobacco was certainly a powerful and addictive drug, it was not
quite clear what <I>kind</I> of drug. Whether or not moderate
smoking was healthy also remained debatable. There were no two
opinions&#151;the <I>Lancet</I> insisted&#151;about the evils of excessive
smoking. The only problem here was: what constituted excess ?
The test, the editorial suggested, was 'smoking <I>early in the
day'</I>&#151;when 'unless a man be the victim of pernicious habits,
he certainly requires neither a sedative nor stimulant'. Anything
over one or two pipes or cigars a day must also be regarded as
excessive. For youths, any indulgence in the drug was dangerous.
Their minds would be emasculated if they were unable to face their
comparatively small anxieties without having recourse to the daily
use of such a narcotic. 'Listless minds and languid bodies, slake-less
thirst and shaking hands, delirium tremens, madness&#151;and death.
We have distinctly and surely followed this unhallowed indulgence
in youths who began their studies with bright promise of success,
with fair characters, and honest purposes.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But by this time it had become futile for the <I>Lancet</I> to
pronounce such warnings. Tobacco, along with tea, had established
itself as one of the drugs of the working classes. It was also
in high favour with men of letters, as endless tributes had begun
to show; in verse&#151;Thomas Hood's
<BLOCKQUOTE>
How oft the fragrant smoke upcurled<BR>
Hath borne me from this little world<BR>
And all that in it lies . . .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
and in prose&#151;Lord Lytton's
<BLOCKQUOTE>
He who doth not smoke hath either known no great griefs, or refuseth
himself the softest consolation next to that which comes from
heaven. 'What, softer than woman?' whispers the young reader.
Young reader, woman teases as well as consoles. Woman makes half
the sorrows which she boasts the privilege to soothe. Woman consoles
us, it is true, while we are young and handsome; when we are old
and ugly, woman snubs and scolds us. On the whole, then, woman
in this scale, the weed in that: Jupiter, hang out thy balance,
and weigh them both; and if thou givest the preference to woman,
all I can say is, the next time Juno ruffles thee&#151;O Jupiter,
try the weed!'
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
By this time, too, the defenders of tobacco had found a fresh
argument. Even if it were addictive, they claimed, at least the
consequences were less hideous than from other addictive drugs,
opium, or alcohol; and they were able to cite E. W. Lane's popular<I>Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians,</I> published
in 1844. Tobacco, Lane had argued, as well as affording cheap
and sober refreshment, calmed the nervous system, thereby probably
restraining the peasant 'from less innocent indulgences'. In his
<I>Letters from Turkey</I> in the 1870s von Moltke went further;
it had been tobacco, he suggested, which had changed the wild
nomadic Scythians, the scourge of their neighbours, into the quiet
and all too sedentary Turk.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The Maine Law</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
A parallel controversy was also in progress about drink. Ought
beer, wine and cider to be considered as a safer alternative to
hard liquors? Or should they be prohibited in case youths, lured
into taking them because they were relatively mild, would be tempted
to move on impetuously to gin, or whiskey, or rum?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
For a time, supporters of wine and beer were dominant. In <I>An
Inquiry into the effects of ardent spirits upon the human body
and mind,</I> published in 1784, Benjamin Rush had argued that
the consumption of beer and wine should be encouraged, in order
to discourage dram-drinking. In Britain, even John Wesley had
praised wine, 'one of the noblest cordials'; and in 1826 Sydney
Smith, recommending ale and tobacco to the readers of the <I>Edinburgh
Review</I> as 'the joys and holidays of millions, the greatest
pleasure which it is in the power of fortune to bestow', warned
that these were amusements 'which a wise and parental legislature
should not despise, or hastily extinguish'. To his mortification
the legislature was soon to go to the other extreme. In 1830 the
Wellington Government, in its death throes, tried to court popularity
with brewers and workers by reducing the cost of the licence to
sell beer to &#163;2 a year&#151;a sum which was small enough to
make it possible for any householder to take out a licence, as
the brewers were delighted to advance the money. There was an
immediate massive increase in the number of public houses&#151;50,000
in six years&#151;and of facilities for cheap beer drinking. As a
result, there was a repetition of what had happened a century
earlier when similar encouragement had been given to gin&#151;though
on a less lethal scale. Again, the prevailing social conditions&#151;with
the lives of workers on the land being disrupted by enclosures,
and of urban workers by the introduction of the factory system&#151;encouraged
the consumption of alcohol as a narcotic rather than a stimulant.
'Everybody is drunk,' Sydney Smith sadly observed, 'those who
are not singing are sprawling. The sovereign people are in a beastly
state.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In 1832 James Teare stood up at a temperance meeting in Manchester
and claimed that <I>all</I> intoxicating liquor was an enemy to
God and man; 'the sooner it is put out of this world, the better'.
Ten weeks later, seven men signed the first teetotal pledge, in
Preston; and in 1835 a national society of teetotallers was formed.
The movement grew rapidly in Britain&#151;and still more rapidly
in Ireland, where Father Mathew's preaching persuaded tens of
thousands to take the pledge. In this period the campaign was
for voluntary abstinence; and although it became known that the
sister movement in the United States was for legislative intervention,
it came as a complete surprise when a prohibition Bill was debated
in the Maine Legislature in 1850, and as a still greater surprise
when, the following year, it was passed. No attempt was made to
stop people bringing liquor into the State for their own consumption,
and the fruit-growers' lobby was influential enough to prevent
apple cider being included in the ban. But 'the Maine Law' was
generally regarded, and described, as prohibition; the first enactment
based on the premise that all alcoholic liquors as such were dangerous
drugs which ought to be taken, if at all, only on a medical prescription.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
What happened in America had the effect of disrupting the movement
in Britain. At first, the news of the Maine Law was enthusiastically
received by all concerned. But it led some reformers to argue
that what had been done in America could be done in Britain; and
a split developed between those who continued to advocate voluntary
abstinence, and those who wanted legal prohibition&#151;the 'suasionists'
and the 'suppressionists', as the two sides came to be described.
In 1853 the United Kingdom Alliance was established 'to procure
the total and immediate legislative suppression of the traffic
in all intoxicating liquors'; and it was soon engaged in vigorous
and sometimes embittered controversy with the suasionists, who
objected to legal compulsion on principle and argued that there
was no chance of such a measure passing in Britain.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The controversy started a public debate on the rights and duties
of the State, in this context, and the arguments were considered
by John Stuart Mill in his <I>Essay on Liberty.</I> Mill took
as his text a letter which Lord Stanley had sent to <I>The Times,</I>
replying to the views propounded by the Secretary of the U.K.
Alliance. 'All matters relating to thought, opinion, conscience
appear to me without the sphere of legislation,' Stanley had argued;
'all pertaining to social act, habit, relations, subject only
to discretionary power vested in the State itself.' But there
was another category, Mill pointed out. Individual acts might
have social consequences. In that case, the Secretary of the Alliance
in effect was arguing,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If anything invades my social rights, certainly the traffic in
strong drink does. It destroys my primary right of security, by
constantly creating and stimulating social disorder. It invades
my right of equality, by deriving a profit from the creation of
a misery I am taxed to support. It impedes my right to free moral
and intellectual development, by surrounding my path with dangers,
and by weakening and demoralising society, from which I have a
right to claim mutual aid and intercourse.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
What this amounted to, Mill thought, was a new theory of social
rights; 'that it is the absolute right of every individual that
every other individual shall act in every respect exactly as he
ought'. So monstrous a principle, Mill felt,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
is far more dangerous than any single interference with liberty;
there is no violation of liberty that it would not justify; it
acknowledges no right to any freedom whatever except, perhaps,
that of holding opinions in secret, without ever disclosing them;
for the moment an opinion I consider noxious passes anyone's lips,
it invades all the 'social rights' attributed to me by the Alliance.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Mill was being unfair. The Alliance were not claiming that because
they disapproved of the consumption of alcohol, they had a right
to stop other people drinking. They were simply arguing that if
an individual's drinking had social consequences of a kind which
affected other people's rights&#151;by, say, making the streets unsafe&#151;they
could then claim that right. As it happened, the Alliance stated
that they did not even want to stop individuals brewing their
own beer; it was the consequences of the liquor traffic, rather
than of liquor, to which they objected. But here, they had put
themselves on weaker ground, as the suasionist Joseph Livesey
pointed out. If the Alliance were going to tell a man, 'you can
brew your own beer', he argued&#151;he failed to see 'how it can
be wrong for your neighbour of the Royal Hotel to brew it for
you, and take pay for it'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Stanley had also uncovered a weakness in the Alliance's case.
Their aim was to suppress the traffic in intoxicants; how were
intoxicants to be defined? 'Is tobacco to be included? Is opium?'
The Secretary of the Alliance, who was presumably well aware that
any attempt to link tobacco with alcohol as a national menace
would weaken his organisation's prospects, was forced to hedge.
The tobacco traffic, he claimed, rested on the drink traffic 'and
would fall with it, without any special enactment'&#151;as also,
he added, would the opium traffic. But he offered no evidence
for this assertion.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Fanshawe's travels</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In Britain, though, the decisive factor&#151;as Livesey realised&#151;was
not going to be philosophical disputation, but the composition
of the House of Commons. 'Out of the 658 members,' he wrote, 'there
are probably not a dozen who would claim to be abstainers. These
gentlemen have their cellars stored with liquor, have it daily
on their tables, and have it introduced on every social occasion
as a mark of friendship&#151;and is it likely that they would pass
a Bill to prevent others enjoying the same, according to their
means?' It was most unlikely; but the hopes of suppressionists
were kept alive partly by the extension of the franchise in Britain,
which brought in working class voters, and partly by the achievements
of the movement in America. Twelve other States had followed Maine's
example; and though there had been backsliding as a result of
the Civil War, the movement had soon picked up again. A National
Prohibition Party was formed in 1869; its candidates began to
win seats in State legislatures; and in 1890, it won its first
seat in the House of Representatives at Washington.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Was it possible that prohibition might be introduced, on a national
scale? Could it work? Did it, in fact, work in the States which
had introduced it ? In 1892 an English lawyer, E. L. Fanshawe,
was despatched on a tour of America and Canada to try to find
out. In his report, he was to claim that his sponsors&#151;he did
not say who they were&#151;had given him strict injunctions to preserve
impartiality; and whatever his personal opinions may have been
(he was no teetotaller, himself) he did not allow them to obtrude.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Fanshawe was intrigued, on his arrival in America, to observe
the differences in drinking habits. They helped, he felt, to account
for the different courses which the temperance movement had been
taking. In public, American men drank only water&#151;iced. Except
in a few cities, he usually found himself the only person taking
wine or beer with his dinner. The clergy were virtually compelled
to be abstainers; and at public functions, drink was the exception.
At gatherings at the White House, disrespectful persons said,
'water flowed like champagne'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Fanshawe found, though, that if he went into a bar, at any hour
of the day, he might meet friends who had been drinking water
at dinner the night before, and they would be having a glass of
whiskey, or a 'cocktail'. Worse (for once, Fanshawe could not
repress his disapproval) they would be 'treating' each other;
a practice so un-English, at that time, that he had to explain
it in a footnote; 'two Americans go together to a bar; one treats
the other who, feeling himself under an obligation, must have
his revenge' (in Nebraska treating had been made illegal, 'but
not prevented').
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Even in States where there was no prohibition, Fanshawe found,
drinking was regarded as a vice. Those who indulged themselves
took care to do so in secret&#151;or at least in privacy. And they
did precisely the same in States where there was prohibition.
He had arrived expecting to hear complaints about the way prohibition
infringed the rights of the individual. Instead, all he heard
was complaints about the difficulties of enforcing it.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This was due partly, he decided, to the fact that the prohibitionists,
not being numerous enough to win on their own ticket, had concentrated
on acquiring sufficient strength to hold the balance of power
between Democrats and Republicans; which put them in a position
to compel one or other party to pass 'dry' legislation, but did
not necessarily compel them, when in office, to enforce it. Enforcement
would depend on who was the successful party's nominee to run
the police; and he might be in the pay of the brewers and distillers.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In any case, the problems confronting even those communities which
were determined to enforce prohibition were formidable. It had
been found relatively easy to enforce 'local option', where that
was the law, because small communities were better able to winkle
out illicit traffickers in their midst. When Fanshawe went to
Cambridge, Mass., he could see just how efficiently it worked.
But it worked efficiently only because Boston was nearby, with
its 'high return of arrests for drunkenness, and its high percentage
of non-residents among those arrested'. As for prohibition at
the State level, Fanshawe's enquiries showed it to be almost farcical.
In Maine, for example, there was nothing to stop citizens bringing
in as much liquor as they could carry. They could even purchase
it in hotels to drink in private rooms; and in Bangor it was openly
sold in bars, and by chemists. In Kansas, the State usually cited
as having done most to make a success of prohibition, he was told
that it was legal for members of clubs to keep liquor; they could
obtain it through 'bootleggers' or&#151;again perfectly legally&#151;by
ordering deliveries from a nearby 'wet' State.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Fanshawe was not called upon by his English sponsors to pronounce
a verdict: but the report spoke it for him. Prohibition could
not hope to work. How could whiskey be kept out of 'dry' Kansas
City (Kan.) when the 'frontier' was an imaginary line running
down the middle of the street dividing it from 'wet' Kansas City
(Mo.)?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Why, then, had the futility of prohibition not been recognised
? One reason, Fanshawe showed, was that men who had the responsibility
for enforcing the law naturally also had an interest in pretending
that it worked, if necessary by deliberate falsehoods. In Kansas,
for example, the attorney general had boasted that prohibition
was 'depopulating the penitentiaries' by reducing violence and
crime, a statement which had been gratefully repeated by the temperance
reformers in England in a pamphlet, <I>Does Prohibition Prohibit?</I>
When Fanshawe investigated the figures, however, he discovered
that in proportion to the population, there were more prisoners
in Kansas jails than there had been in 1860, the year prohibition
had been introduced&#151;a higher proportion, in fact, than in the
adjoining 'wet' States.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The fundamental difficulty about enforcement was that the man
in the street, whatever he might do in the polling booth, was
on the side of the law-breakers, rather than of the law&#151;as an
enforcement officer he had met in Bangor had freely admitted.
And this was having the unfortunate effect of bringing the law
itself into discredit, by engendering 'a spirit of disregard for
its observance'. It was also corrupting American political life.
In Rhode Island, Fanshawe was told, a Republican attorney general
had tried to implement campaign promises by bringing over a hundred
offenders to justice. Their lawyers cleverly delayed proceedings
until after the next elections, to give time for 'wet' influence
in both parties to get to work. He was not re-elected&#151;the only
Republican on the slate who failed to secure re-election; and
the proceedings were quietly dropped.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The Anti-Saloon League</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Fanshawe's report, published in England, was hardly likely to
make any impact in the United States. Even if it had been, a different
verdict could have been wrung from it; that prohibition could
never succeed unless it was extended to all States of the Union,
and backed by federal law and federal enforcement. And while he
was there, the movement which was eventually to succeed in persuading
the necessary proportion of the electorate to accept that solution
was getting under way: the Anti-Saloon League, founded in 1893.
For a time, however, there appeared to be a possibility of a compromise
plan, satisfying both suasionists and suppressionists, derived
from the Gothenburg experiment, begun in Sweden in the 1860s.
It was not prohibition, but it went some way to satisfy the suppressionist
aim of concentrating on the traffic, rather than on drink, by
taking control away from private enterprise and putting it in
the hands of 'disinterested management'. The manufacture, distribution
and sale of drink were looked after by a board, none of whose
members was allowed to have any pecuniary interest; the aim being
not to stop consumption, but to ensure that it did the least possible
harm.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To this end, alcoholic drinks became obtainable only through a
form of lay prescription. The hours at which they could be purchased,
and the type of premises in which they could be consumed, were
designed to discourage social drinking. The idea was to favour
beer at the expense of spirits, and the consumption of beer rose
rapidly; but as it had been very low before, and as the consumption
of spirits fell, the experiment was regarded as successful, and
the system became general through Sweden and Norway.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
For a while, the United Kingdom Alliance was attracted to the
Gothenburg idea, thinking it might prove a handy stepping-stone
on the way to ultimate prohibition. It also attracted Joseph Chamberlain,
fitting in as it did with his view that all monopolies granted
by the State should be managed by local authorities for the community,
rather than for private profit. When he was elected to the Commons
in 1876, he moved a resolution in favour of a scheme along Gothenburg
lines, and it attracted fifty supporters.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In the United States, too, some interest was shown in the experiment;
the Massachusetts legislature and the Federal Department of Labor
in Washington sent investigators to Sweden, both of them making
favourable reports on how the scheme was working. But by this
time the movement for outright prohibition was gaining too much
momentum to be thus sidetracked. The Anti-Saloon League established
itself on a national basis, and it was to provide the organisation
by which, over the next twenty years, prohibition became so powerful
a cause that politicians were no longer able to exploit it for
their own ends; instead, they found, the prohibitionists were
able to exploit them. By the 1906 elections, the League was able
to show that it could wreck the chances of a politician who opposed
it; his name was sent for suitable treatment to the League's accredited
speakers, and also circulated on a black list to all electors.
The party bosses began to require their candidates to agree to
pledge themselves not to oppose prohibition; better still, to
endorse it.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There were some setbacks; but by 1913 the League showed its power
when the Webb-Kenyon Bill, designed to assist States to enforce
prohibition more effectively, was passed in spite of a Presidential
veto. And to the frustration of the liquor interests, the war,
when it came, did nothing to hinder the prohibitionists; it actually
helped them, as economists demanded cuts in drink consumption
to save cereals for the G.I.'s rations; and Congress agreed to
sponsor an amendment to the Constitution to enable prohibition
to be introduced.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The d'Abernon Committee</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In Britain, too, the war helped the suppressionist cause. If Lloyd
George had been able to get his way, prohibition might have been
introduced there, too, to assist the war effort. But opinion in
Parliament and in the Cabinet was still hostile; and the cost
of some variant of the Gothenburg system, which he also contemplated,
would have involved astronomical sums to compensate the liquor
interests. His colleagues were able to argue, too, that the consumption
of alcoholic liquor was falling rapidly, helped by a voluntary
abstinence campaign (King George V abjured drink for himself and
the Court for the duration of the war) and by various restrictions
imposed by 'DORA'&#151;the Defence of the Realm Act, which among
other things regulated the hours at which public houses could
remain open. Although Lloyd George remained convinced that&#151;as
he claimed in 1916&#151;Britain was fighting Germany, Austria and
drink, 'and the greatest of these three deadly foes is drink',
he allowed himself to be persuaded that not enough was known about
the enforced deprivation of drink on workers; and it was agreed
that before any decision was taken, a Committee under Lord d'Abernon
should investigate the whole subject of the effects of alcohol,
and 'more particularly the effects on health and industrial efficiency
produced by the consumption of beverages of various alcoholic
strengths'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Committee's report, published in 1917, differed from those
of earlier parliamentary investigations in one significant respect;
it considered the action of alcohol as a drug. It was also, the
Committee conceded, a common article of diet; and the habit of
drinking was encouraged by the agreeable taste of fermented liquors.
They insisted, nevertheless, that it was basically as a drug that
alcoholic liquor was consumed.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The need to consider alcohol in this way had been stressed by
Sydney Hillier in his <I>Popular Drugs,</I> published in 1910.
He had devoted half the book to it, explaining that while statistics
showed there had been a general decline in the consumption of
alcoholic drinks in England, the news should not be welcomed unreservedly,
because it did not necessarily mean any reduction in drug consumption;
'no statistics are available relating to morphinism or other drug
habits, but there is a very general consensus of opinion, among
those who are best able to judge, that there is an increase in
the number of persons addicted'. Drink must never&#151;Hillier insisted&#151;be
considered as a problem in its own right. The possibility must
always be kept in mind that it might be the lesser of two evils.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Lord d'Abernon and his colleagues, however, were asked to consider
only drink, and its effects on the war effort. The figures they
collected were sufficient to warn the Government of the magnitude
of the confrontation Lloyd George was contemplating. The amount
spent annually on alcoholic liquor in the United Kingdom was half
as much again as the entire receipts from the railway system,
and more than double the expenditure on bread. Until the war,
the amount spent had been almost equal to the entire revenue of
the State; and in some countries it had actually been more. What
was likely to happen if prohibition were introduced was not within
the Committee's terms of reference; but the statistics were disturbing
enough in themselves. Lloyd George decided it would be wise to
rely on' DORA'&#151;reinforced by such occasional additions such
as a 'No Treating' order, and reductions in the strength of beer.
The expedients worked well enough. By the end of the war, consumption
of beer had fallen by nearly a third, and of spirits by more than
a half. The rate of 'drunk and disorderly' convictions, too, dropped
from nearly 200,000 in the first year of the war to below 30,000
in the last.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The Volstead Act</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
No similar inquiry was conducted in the United States. The required
quota of States having announced their ratification, Prohibition
was introduced in 1920. Three years later Roy Haynes, the Commissioner
in charge of the enforcement of Prohibition (as it came to be
called, with a capital 'P') gave an account in <I>Prohibition
Inside Out.</I> It was designed to show that, appearances notwithstanding,
'the illegal liquor traffic is under control'. But Haynes was
also anxious to defend himself and his subordinates from criticism,
already mounting. To do so, he had to describe the difficulties
that had confronted them; and the book turned into a treatise
on why the illegal liquor traffic had not been, and could not
be, brought under control.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To begin with, there had been the unwelcome discovery that the
demand for hard liquor was&#151;in the economists' new jargon&#151;inelastic.
A high proportion of the spirit drinkers of the pre-Prohibition
era were prepared to continue to buy their supplies, even if the
price doubled or trebled. As expected, some were men and women
from all classes who had become so dependent on drink that they
could not bear to do without it. But much more serious was the
number of respectable citizens who were drinkers in moderation,
and who had no intention of drinking any less, whatever the law
might say. 'One finds upon the Roll of Dishonour proud old names
long worn without stain or blemish, now close-linked with names
that have been a by-word with the <I>demi-monde</I> of half a
hundred cities', Haynes lamented. 'One finds names that once epitomised
honour and power and community esteem, steeped in the same befouling
brew with the names of thieves, thugs and murderers.' Nor was
it only the rich man who must have his drink. It was also the
industrial worker, especially the immigrant; the German steel
worker in Milwaukee, who had always regarded his beer as part
of his life; the New York Italian who had never been drunk, yet
could not conceive of a meal without wine.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To cater for this demand there were six main sources of supply;
genuine liquor, in stock; genuine liquor diluted or mixed with
synthetic varieties; synthetic liquor made from grain alcohol,
with colour and flavour added; 'moonshine'&#151;liquor distilled
from vegetable substances; 'denatured' alcohol, redistilled; and
wood alcohol. This variety of sources would have made Haynes'
task difficult enough; what made it impossible was the variety
of uses for which alcohol could still legally be manufactured.
In the event of any attempt to stop the use of communion wine,
the Rev. E. A. Wasson had announced in 1914, 'we would do as our
Lord told us to do&#151;&quot;all of you, drink of this&quot;&#151;if
we had to go to jail for it'. The threat had sufficed: Communion
wine was exempted from the law, and many a consignment so labelled
found its way to the dinner, rather than the altar table. An even
more abundant source was medical prescription. Whiskey and brandy
had been dropped from the <I>Pharmacopeia</I> in 1916, but alcohol
remained an essential ingredient in prescriptions for a wide range
of diseases; and although prescribing habits were subjected to
scrutiny, any doctor who was prepared to break the law, either
for cash reward or for the benefit of himself and his friends,
ran little risk. Chemists, too, licensed as they were to sell
alcohol in certain forms, found the law easy to evade.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The most prolific source of alcohol, though, was industry, which
had so great a need for it that considerable quantities could
be siphoned off without exciting suspicion. Industrial alcohol
was 'denatured'&#151;rendered unfit for human consumption; but it
could easily be re-distilled. Firms were set up ostensibly to
produce commodities which required an alcohol base, but in reality
to divert the alcohol into illicit channels. A State Governor,
Giffard Pinchot, estimated in 1924 that the 150 firms which had
been authorised in his State to purchase de-natured alcohol to
manufacture perfumes and hair tonics had ordered enough of it
to fulfill the needs of the population of the entire world.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
What with 'moonshine'&#151;easy enough to make and, in a country
the size of the United States, extremely difficult to check&#151;Haynes
had been unable to stem the flow of illicit spirits manufactured
in the United States. But he had also to deal with smuggling;
and the difficulties that presented, as set out in his book, and
as expressed by other law enforcement officers at the time, read
like a weird parody of what had happened in China with opium,
a century before. Vast quantities of liquor&#151; James Beck, a Washington
law officer, complained in an article in the London <I>Sunday
Times</I> on July 15th, 1923&#151;were being taken out from British
possessions
<BLOCKQUOTE>
with a full knowledge that they were to be used to violate the
laws of the United States and break down this policy of prohibition.
Our requests that clearance papers should be refused to notorious
rum-runners were denied. They persisted, and wholesale lawlessness
virtually challenged the right of the U.S. to be master within
its own household, for it has never been challenged by any competent
authority on international law that each sovereign nation, notwithstanding
the comity of nations, has entire right to assert full police
power over any foreign merchant vessel within the territorial
limits of the sovereign.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
William Jennings Bryan made the same complaint. 'There is no more
excuse for the use of adjacent territory for conspiracies against
the Prohibition Law . . . than for the use of such territory for
conspiracies against any other law of the land. Piracy would not
be given protection under the British flag. Why should smuggling?'
British merchants were as little disposed to listen to such arguments
as they had been to listen to Commissioner Lin. The Scottish distillers
even found a way of expanding their market. Distillers in the
United States had been permitted to continue to export their spirits,
provided they were sold for 'nonbeverage purposes'. The Scotch
distillers, buying them in bulk, could truthfully claim they had
no intention of drinking them; the whiskey they made out of them
was sent back across the Atlantic, for the Americans to drink.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Canadian distillers were soon on to the same ruse. As Haynes
sarcastically commented, the residents of British Columbia, who
had previously shown no enthusiasm for American whiskey, suddenly
become so enamoured of it that they required 200,000 gallons.
They, too, had been careful to honour the pledge that they were
not going to drink it; they had promptly re-exported it to California.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The French, too, had not been disposed to let their wine and brandy
trade to the United States be terminated. The islands of St. Pierre
and Miquelon became the equivalent of Lintin. There were only
about 4,000 inhabitants and they were soon buying 1,000 gallons
per head, annually, of various liquors. Their harbours were thronged
with depot ships, supplying schooners designed to carry 50,000
gallons, which could cruise in safety outside the three-mile limit
for weeks at a time, waiting for smuggling craft which came out
from the shore, or taking with them their own equivalent of the
'fast crabs'&#151;speed boats which were faster than anything the
American customs possessed, and which could run a consignment
ashore, land it, and return to the parent ship in the course of
a night. If it were too risky to put it ashore, they would dump
it on the seabed, with a buoy to mark its position, and leave
the vendor to collect it when he judged it safe to do so (a standard
wine drinkers' joke was that the test whether a bottle of wine
was a genuine import was the mud on the bottle).
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There was also piracy. Prohibition had not been many months in
force before Haynes received a report that pirate ships were beginning
to operate along the Atlantic coast. 'Their method of operation
is to learn of the destination and route of a boat regularly engaged
in smuggling from the Bahamas and then overtake it, overpower
the crew, and remove the cargo of liquor to the pirate boats.'
Piracy even came to the Great Lakes, where men in 'swift Little
motor boats' waited just out of sight of land to intercept the
smugglers, knowing the smugglers could not call on the law to
protect them.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In one respect, Haynes was worse off than Lin had been. He had
the land frontier with Canada to protect&#151;as long as the distance
from England to India, he ruefully noted. For much of its length
it was marked only on the map; and, as somebody had put it, 'you
cannot keep liquor from dripping through a dotted line'. The American
enforcement officials could actually watch the liquor arriving,
and being put into warehouses across the border; but they were
themselves being watched, and no move would be made until at a
signal from the American side, small boats or lorries would run
the consignments across. It was more difficult&#151;one of Haynes'
men who had been a G.I. complained&#151;than trench warfare in France;
'over there we could shoot them or grab them where we saw them,
or go right in and get them; but over here we've got to wait till
they come over to our side of no man's land.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
So, bootlegging had already become a major industry; and the consequences,
Haynes did not attempt to hide, had been catastrophic. As there
could be no legal redress if inferior, or even poisonous, liquor
was passed off as gin or whiskey, the consumer had no protection.
In Chicago, coroners' verdicts revealed that a hundred people
had died in the first five months in 1923 from drinking 'bootleg
hooch'; and the real figure, he felt, must certainly have been
far higher.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Equally serious was the way in which Prohibition was breeding
corruption. Forty-three of Haynes' agents had been found guilty
of illegalities in Philadelphia alone; and although he claimed
that this represented only a small proportion of the total force,
he was careless enough in another part of his book to stress that
the number of such offenders caught was 'doubtless but a fraction
of those who are guilty'. Nor was it only his men who became involved.
Reports of a trial in an Indiana town disclosed that liquor had
been freely on sale there in saloons&#151;and even in soft drink
establishments; the proprietor of one of them complained that
he had had to mortgage his premises, in order to pay the protection
money demanded of him. This was the result of a conspiracy which
<BLOCKQUOTE>
included the mayor, the sheriff, a judge of the city court, the
prosecuting attorney of the county, a former sheriff, a former
prosecuting attorney, a detective sergeant, a justice of the peace,
an influential lawyer, and former deputy sheriffs, detectives,
policemen, petty lawyers, bartenders, cabaret singers and notorious
women.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Haynes naively believed that the publicity given to the Indiana
trial would lead to increasing respect for the law. But the sentences
passed on the conspirators, considering the enormity of their
offense, had been derisory; and he had to admit that the light
fines often imposed in such cases had 'contributed in no small
way to the spirit of defiance in which bootleggers hold the law'.
Although there had been a fair haul of little fish, the big-time
violators had found little difficulty in avoiding prosecution&#151;or,
if they were prosecuted, in escaping conviction.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Repeal</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The story of Prohibition has been told too often to need repeating.
It was to last for another ten years, with the forces of the law
becoming annually more disillusioned, more ineffectual, and more
corrupt, while the bootleggers became richer, more powerful and&#151;as
Sidney Whipple was to show in his <I>Noble Experiment</I>&#151;more
ingenious; especially the smugglers. They would arrange for consignments
to be periodically intercepted by a customs man who was in their
pay, so that he could lull suspicions; perhaps even get himself
written up as a hero in the local newspapers. So much a matter
of course did the traffic from Canada become that the prices obtainable
for consignments in the nearest United States city would be available
in bars&#151;as the price of opium had been listed in Jardine's Canton
newspaper.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The initial reaction to Prohibition's failure was a demand for
higher penalties, as a deterrent; and these were duly imposed
in many States. In Michigan, a mandatory scale of penalties was
laid down, culminating at the fourth offense with imprisonment
for life. When the first life sentence was imposed, the culprit
turned out to be not the local Al Capone but Mrs. Etta May Miller,
mother of ten, whose fourth offense was being found in illicit
possession of a bottle of gin. That was an extreme example: but
because it was so rare for any of the men who ran the bootlegging
industry to be convicted, the policy of high penalties fell into
disrepute; as did Prohibition.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Even in 1923, Haynes had lamented, there had been those who undermined
the law by criticising it; particularly the smartly dressed men
and women, in fashionable drawing rooms or restaurants,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The colour deepens on milady's cheek; the voice of her escort
grows thick.<BR>
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  What are they saying as the pocket flasks run low?<BR>
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  'Prohibition is a joke . . . it can never be enforced . . . it's<BR>
dead easy to get all you want . . . they can never make this city
dry . . . popular opinion's against the law.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
As the 1920s went by, such opinions came to be more often heard,
until even President Hoover was forced to realise that Prohibition's
effects were destructive&#151;and embarrassing, in terms of the international
reputation of the United States (with the possible exception of
the Prince of Wales, Capone was the world's best known public
figure). As Hoover had described Prohibition as 'this noble experiment',
and had won election with the help of 'dry' votes, he could not
very well demand that it should be repealed; instead, he resorted
to the traditional expedient of a Commission of Enquiry&#151;ten
men and the President of Radcliffe, Ada Comstock. They studied
the subject for eighteen months, and in spite of the fact that
they had a built-in conservative Republican bias, they had to
concede in their report, published early in 1931, that Prohibition
had failed. There was a mass of evidence, they had found, of drinking
'in homes, in clubs, and in hotels; of drinking parties given
and attended by persons of high standing and respectability; of
drinking by tourists at winter and summer resorts; and of drinking
in connection with public dinners and at conventions'. There was
similar evidence of drinking by women, and by the country's youth:
'votes in colleges show an attitude of hostility to or contempt
for the law on the part of those who are not unlikely to be leaders
in the next generation'. The same attitude was also to be found
in the views and the conduct of well-off citizens in the average
community, and 'in the tolerance of conduct at social gatherings
which would not have been possible a generation ago'. Taking the
country as a whole,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
people of wealth, business men and professional men and their
families, and, perhaps, the higher paid working men and their
families, are drinking in large numbers in quite frank disregard
of the declared policy of the National Prohibition Act.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
One reason, the Report continued, was people's irritation with
State interference in a matter where they felt the State had no
business interfering.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In consequence, many of the best citizens of every community,
on whom we rely habitually for the upholding of law and order,
are at most lukewarm as to the national Prohibition Act. Many
who are normally law-abiding are led to an attitude hostile to
the statute by a feeling that repression and interference with
private conduct are carried too far. This is aggravated in many
of the larger cities by a feeling that other parts of the land
are seeking to impose on them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
As a result, crime had become rampant, the huge profits enabling
bootleggers to defy attempts to enforce the law; and there were
'revelations of police corruption in every type of municipality,
small and large, throughout the decade'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The report alarmed Hoover, less for its depressing verdict than
because of the implications for his forthcoming Presidential campaign,
when he would need the 'dry' vote. He held meetings with the Commission,
and managed to persuade them that however disastrous the consequences
of Prohibition might be, this was not the time to end it; which
enabled him to claim that 'by a large majority' the Committee
'does not favour the repeal of the 18th Amendment as a method
of cure for the inherent abuses of the liquor traffic. I am in
accord with this view.' Collectively, as a Committee, this was
what they had agreed. But only three of them, as individuals,
had supported the continuance of the Act. The rest, for their
own reasons, had recommended either that it should be repealed,
or substantially revised.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
As it happened, there was by this time a further argument against
Prohibition, which may have been decisive; the need to provide
more employment, and more revenue, following the great crash.
The prices of illicit liquor in general had held so steady during
the whole Prohibition period that it was actually possible to
assess, with a reasonable expectation of accuracy, what the Government
could expect to get from duties if the trade was again legalised;
roughly the same, it was found, as it got from income tax. 'Dry'
influence was still sufficiently feared for Franklin D. Roosevelt
to refrain from actively denouncing Prohibition in the 1931 Presidential
campaign; but he pledged himself, if elected, to put the Prohibition
issue to the individual States. By the end of the year following
his election, enough of them had ratified repeal to bring the
noble experiment to an end.

<H2>The International Anti-drug Campaign</H2></CENTER>
<HR>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
IT HAD NOT NEEDED THE FAILURE OF PROHIBITION TO TEACH THE 
Americans that if drugs were to be controlled in domestic use, the need
would arise for international regulation, too. Half a century
before, there had been alarm at the spread of opium smoking introduced
by the Chinese who came to work in California; and also at the
more insidious form of opium consumption indulged in by the growing
numbers of Americans who were persuaded to take tonics or cordials
which had the drug as a prime constituent. After the Americans
took over the Philippines, too, they became concerned about opium
consumption there. Measures to check the traffic proving unsuccessful,
the idea of imposing international control was mooted; and by
a fortunate chance, the opportunity suddenly presented itself
to secure international agreement.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The Shanghai conference</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
For some years, the improvement in the quality of the opium produced
in China had been reminding the British in India that their hold
on the Chinese market could not last much longer. Indian opium&#151;the
Hong Kong <I>Daily News</I> had warned in the 1880s&#151;was becoming
a drug on the market 'in more senses than one'; the day would
soon come when the native Chinese article would be exported. Exports
from India to China, which had risen decade by decade for so long,
began to fall, the quantity of home produced opium in China surging
rapidly past the quantity imported.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In December 1905 the Conservative Government in Britain, which
had held power for a decade, resigned; and the following spring,
the House of Commons unanimously adopted a resolution 'that this
House reaffirms its conviction that the Indo-Chinese opium traffic
is morally indefensible, and requests His Majesty's Government
to take such steps as may be necessary for bringing it to a speedy
close'. The new Liberal Government, urged on by its back-benchers'
humanitarian zeal, opened negotiations with the Chinese by offering
to reduce opium exports annually, provided they reduced home production,
step by step, and did not import from other countries. If all
went smoothly, in ten years' time the traffic could cease. The
Chinese unhesitatingly accepted. 'It is hereby commanded,' the
imperial edict ran, 'that within a period of ten years the evils
arising from foreign and native opium be equally and completely
eradicated.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The American Government, alerted by the authorities in the Philippines,
realised that if India and China really did reduce production
there was a chance that the United States' problems could be solved,
too, provided that other countries did not expand production.
Through the prompting of the State Department, an International
Conference was convened in Shanghai in 1909 to study the whole
opium problem. All the major countries with an interest in the
traffic were invited and only one, Turkey, did not send a representative,
owing to her domestic upheavals&#151;a valid enough excuse, as they
were to lead to the victory of the Young Turks, and the deposition
of Abdul the Damned. The representatives of the remaining thirteen
states met, conferred, and agreed in principle that there was
a need for greater effort on the part of their Governments to
control the traffic in opium and its derivatives, particularly
morphine.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Shanghai Conference had been arranged only for an exchange
of views; but its success prompted President Taft to call for
a Conference of Delegates with plenipotentiary powers. It met
at The Hague in 1911, attended by the representatives of China,
France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,
Persia, Portugal, Russia, Siam and the U.S.A. And again, a heartening
measure of agreement was reached. In future, it was agreed, the
production and distribution of raw opium should be carefully regulated,
and its export to other countries permitted only to duly authorised
persons, through duly authorised channels. The production, distribution
and consumption of prepared opium&#151;the kind normally used for
smoking&#151;was gradually to be suppressed altogether, so that trade
in it would cease. The production and distribution of opium derivatives
was to be restricted to the amounts required for medical and scientific
purposes. The necessary licensing arrangements, the delegates
agreed, would be introduced by their respective States, when they
ratified the agreement.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Crucial to the success of the whole enterprise, clearly, was the
satisfactory working of the Anglo-Chinese agreement. And it had
far surpassed expectations&#151;as even the sceptical British Consul-General
in China, Sir Alexander Hosie, was compelled to admit. As he had
toured the poppy growing areas of China in the 1880s, he could
make the necessary comparisons; and touring them again in 1910,
he found that poppy cultivation in some provinces had virtually
ceased, and in most others had been greatly reduced. Public opinion,
it appeared, had been roused against opium, in much the same way
as it had been aroused against spirits in Ireland by Father Mathew,
but with the added element of patriotic fervour, opium still being
identified with foreign oppression. And in a country as heavily
populated as China, it was easy to detect and prevent poppy cultivation,
when the will was there. Although the revolution in the central
provinces in 1911, and the subsequent breakdown of the central
Government's authority, meant that the drive finally to eliminate
opium production lost momentum, enough had been accomplished to
show that it might be possible to achieve that purpose, when order
was restored.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In India, too, opium production was being steadily reduced&#151;or
so the authorities claimed. But on a visit to Japan in 1916 the
young American writer Ellen La Motte met a Hindu, who assured
her that the authorities were lying. They had reduced production
only so long as there was no alternative, because the Chinese
market was slipping from their grasp; but they were still deeply
involved in the traffic. At the time, La Motte assumed his allegations
were the product of his nationalist fervour; but in the year which
she spent touring Eastern countries, she came to realise that
they were wholly justified.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
As soon as the agreement to reduce exports of Indian opium to
China had been entered into, she discovered, every effort had
been made to evade it. The simplest way had been to send opium
to the International Settlements in the Treaty Ports, which were
not 'China' for export purposes. As a result&#151;a Shanghai missionary
had shown&#151;the number of licensed opium dealers in the International
Settlement there had risen from 87 before the agreement, to 663
in 1914; and the value of opium imports into the Settlements had
nearly trebled. The figures published showing the reduction in
exports of opium to China also concealed the fact that much of
it was finding its way there in a different, derivative, form.
Board of Trade returns disclosed that exports of British morphine
to the Eastern countries had been rising rapidly; from five and
a half tons in 1911 to fourteen tons in 1914.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Although the acreage under poppy cultivation in India had fallen
following the agreement with China, Ellen La Motte was able to
show that the fall had stopped by the time war broke out, and
output had begun to rise again. Such confidence did the British
Government have that the market, so far from continuing to contract&#151;as
the Hague Convention envisaged&#151;would remain buoyant, that a
loan made to Persia was guaranteed from the Persian opium revenue.
Although the Persian delegate had signed the Hague Convention,
La Motte recalled, his Government did not ratify it: 'no wonder!'
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The League of Nations</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
By the time the first of La Motte's exposures of the duplicity
of the British Government's opium policy appeared, however&#151;in
1920&#151;the League of Nations had been established; and one of
its functions was to take over the supervision of international
agreements such as the Hague Convention. At the League's first
meeting, an advisory committee on opium and other drugs was set
up, with two functions; to collect and analyse information on
the drug traffic, and to try to persuade member States to keep
the regulations laid down to control it. The information collected,
when analysed, revealed that La Motte's strictures had been justified.
The Hague Convention was revealed as no more than a string of
aspirations.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The contracting nations, for example, had pledged themselves to
control the output of raw and prepared opium; but they had been
careful not to say how, or when. They had promised to manufacture
no more opium derivatives than were required for scientific and
medical purposes; but they had not settled how much was required.
And even when specific pledges had been made&#151;for example, to
end the trade in prepared opium&#151;there had been nothing to stop
merchants in the countries which had previously imported it ordering,
instead, the equivalent amount of raw opium, and processing it
themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Britain, as the chief opium producer, was the chief beneficiary;
but firms in many countries shared in the profits, particularly
in Switzerland, already providing a haven for those who were evading
their own country's fiscal laws. The Dutch merchants were also
well placed. Although their Government had been host to the Hague
Conference, and had been nominally in charge of securing adherence
to the Convention until the League took over, it had neglected
to make any regulation requiring returns from Dutch companies
of their output of morphine or cocaine. There was consequently
no legal means of telling whether they were conforming to the
Hague code. Nor would the figures, had they been supplied, necessarily
have been reliable. The Hague Convention, in requesting that relevant
statistics should be furnished, had neglected to make any provision
to ensure that the statistics would be accurate. At their fifth
session, the members of the Opium Committee of the League were
presented with, among other documents, two sets of figures; one
from the British, purporting to be the amounts of morphine exported
from Britain to Japan between 1916 and 1920; the other from the
Japanese, purporting to be the amounts of morphine imported from
Britain in the same period.<P><CENTER>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
No satisfactory explanation could be found for the discrepancies&#151;or
for the one pound of morphine exported in 1920; but at least they
alerted the League to the futility of relying on information provided
by interested parties.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The British blandly used such evidence to justify their policy
of keeping opium a government monopoly. British governments, the
implication was, could not lie, nor could they cheat. In reply
to La Motte and others who accused them of exploiting the drug
for revenue, they reverted to the old excuse that, on the contrary,
they were keeping the duty high to discourage consumption. She
had shown that in the Straits Settlements, in the first decade
of the century, opium duties had sometimes provided the bulk of
the revenue&#151;a fact which, as it had been reported to Parliament
by a commission of enquiry, the Government could not easily dispute.
But&#151;the League's Opium Committee was told&#151;this was precisely
why the Colonial Government had acquired monopoly powers in 1910&#151;for
the purpose of 'gradual and effective suppression'. The Government
had implemented that policy by drastically reducing the number
of licensed opium dens, which had fallen from 500 in 1909 to 200
in 1922, and by putting up the price. It was only later that the
statistics, when they were published, revealed that so far from
the suppression policy being effective, the State monopoly had
actually contrived to sell more opium, in spite of the reduction
in the number of licensed dens. Coupled with the higher price,
this had meant a most gratifying increase of revenue; in 1918
opium still accounted for sixty per cent of the Straits Settlements'
entire income.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In India, too, the Government was doing its best to recoup some
of the losses following the agreement with China by encouraging
the sale of opium under licence; when in 1921 the young Gandhi
called for a campaign against 'that other oppressor'&#151;as he described
the drug&#151;his followers were arrested on charges of 'undermining
the revenue'. So little concerned were the British about the views
of the League of Nations that after a Commission under Lord Inchcape
had investigated India's finances in 1923, its report, while recognising
that it might be necessary to reduce opium production again if
prices fell, went on to warn against diminishing the area cultivated,
because of the need to safeguard 'this most important source of
income'.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The 1925 Convention</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
By this time, public opinion in the United States had been roused;
and in February 1923 a Resolution was put before the House of
Representatives in Washington by Stephen Porter, Chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee, arguing that the crucial factor was
overproduction of opium. At the very most, the world needed 125
tons of opium for medical and scientific purposes&#151;less than
one-tenth of what was currently being produced. All the evidence,
he said, went to show that in such circumstances, 'habit-forming
narcotic drugs, by reason of their extraordinary nature, will
overcome all barriers, even the bars of prisons'&#151;and he quoted
Sir John Jordan, by this time a member of the League of Nations
Opium Committee, 'Whatever and wherever opium is produced it will
reach the consumer.' To try to control the traffic by even the
most drastic of laws was futile; the only hope for effective control
was to get the producing nations to cut production. Both Houses
of Congress unanimously agreed to ask the President to request
the producer nations to accept the necessary regulations. In the
autumn, the Assembly of the League called a fresh conference,
with delegates from interested member countries (and from the
United States, though she was not a member) with plenipotentiary
powers, to see what could be done to improve upon the Hague Convention.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To Ellen La Motte, who came to Geneva from America to report on
its deliberations, it was a heartening experience. Here were delegates
from most of the great nations of the world coming together to
grapple with one of the greatest of man-made evils; and the most
impressive feature of all, she felt, was the integrity and dedication
of the representatives of the countries which had suffered most.
'One fact emerged clearly', she wrote in her first report to the
<I>Nation</I> magazine. 'The whole Orient is anxious to put down
opium.' But some of the European nations were equally anxious
to keep it up. Britain, as the European country which controlled
the major source of opium, would be the key; 'if Britain yields,
the rest will collapse'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
At the first meeting, the British delegates showed themselves
apparently ready and anxious to yield. They raised no objection
to the proposal, backed by the Americans and the Chinese, that
opium production and distribution should in future be limited
by international agreement. The only question&#151;the British delegates
suggested&#151;was how ? The answer, the Americans replied, was simple.
An estimate should be made of the quantity of opium and its derivatives
required for medical and scientific purposes, and production limited
to that amount by international agreement. Again, the British
agreed, merely stipulating that the term 'legitimate' should be
added to 'medical and scientific'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It seemed reasonable; but as the Americans soon realised; it effectively
sabotaged their proposal. One by one the delegates of the colonial
powers rose to explain what uses for opium, in their own colonies,
they would consider 'legitimate'. The Dutch pointed out that allowance
must be made for custom; smoking opium might be evil, but it had
been eaten from time immemorial in the Dutch East Indies. The
French found it difficult to understand why it should be considered
any better to eat opium than to smoke it; if consumption was going
to be permitted at all, there was no reason to suppress it simply
because of the way it was taken (in French Indo-China, opium was
usually smoked). The British agreed. What mattered was not how
the drug was taken, but for what purpose; they could not regard
the use of opium as a 'family drug' as illegitimate (in India,
opium was licensed for sale as a family drug). Each delegate assured
the Americans of his country's willingness to accept their proposal,
so long as it was understood that each country had the right to
decide what form of consumption was legitimate in its own colonies,
and how much could be produced to cater for it. The Americans,
disillusioned, quit the Conference, the British explaining that
it was all the Washington Government's fault, for giving them
firm instructions which left no room for compromise. But La Motte
was sure that the instructions which the British delegates had
received had been just as firm&#151;'make it as difficult as you
like for a person to buy a grain of heroin, but don't hamper an
&quot;authorised person&quot; from buying a ton, from time to
time, as he pleases'. The British, though, had been careful not
to reveal their policy.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The British had certainly behaved as if 'don't touch production'
had been their brief. When the Chinese urged them to introduce
restrictions in their own colonial territories, they fell back
on the argument they had adopted a century before: what would
be the use? Some other country would simply move in on the market,
and keep the colonies supplied by smuggling. The British delegates
scarcely bothered to conceal which 'other country' they assumed
would do the smuggling: China. For a hundred years they had argued
that they could do nothing to prevent opium from British colonies
being smuggled into China. Now, with exasperating logic, they
were claiming they would be able to do nothing to prevent Chinese
opium from being smuggled into British colonies. Following the
American example, the Chinese delegation departed.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The colonial powers, however, were careful to avoid giving the
impression that they were blocking reform. An impressive-looking
list of proposals for control of the opium traffic was adopted
before the Conference adjourned.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Coca and Indian hemp were added to the list of substances which
were to be restricted. The contracting countries were to 'undertake'
to enforce the regulations&#151;rather than, as the Hague agreement
had put it, to 'use their best endeavours' to enforce them. A
permanent Central Narcotics Board was to be established, to which
the contracting countries would be required to make returns of
all imports and exports of the listed drugs, and also to show,
separately, the estimated amounts required for medical and scientific
purposes. When there was evidence of excessive production or importation,
the country concerned could be asked to give an explanation. An
international accounting agency, with powers to investigate, was
also to be set up; and the contracting parties agreed to accept
compulsory arbitration in any dispute arising out of the new Convention
which could not be settled by other means. Considering the difficulties
which the Conference had faced, not least through the withdrawal
of the Americans and Chinese, its achievements appeared very creditable,
on paper.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
American observers were not deceived. A former Editor of the <I>New
York Evening Post</I> and Chief of the Washington Bureau of the
Associated Press, John P. Gavit, had been covering the meetings;
and he asked himself, when they were over, what steps the Conference
had taken 'reasonably calculated to limit the manufacture of these
substances or the production of the raw material from which they
are made'. The answer, he felt bound to emphasise, was <I>'none
whatsoever'.</I> Only two of the decisions, he felt, had held
out any promise: that relevant information would be more carefully
scrutinised and correlated: and that the permanent Central Narcotics
Board was to be composed of men who 'by their technical competence,
impartiality, and disinterestedness will command general confidence'&#151;they
were to be given five-year contracts, further to reduce their
dependence on their own governments. But Gavit was obviously not
the only person to have realised that a strong independent central
board, by publicising the relevant information, would be able
to expose which States were failing in their duty. Switzerland,
whose pharmaceutical industry handled much of the European narcotics
traffic, promptly served notice that if the information she forwarded
to the Board was disclosed to her disadvantage, 'she would forthwith
cease to furnish any'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Swiss need not have worried; the central board was never set
up, its place being taken by an advisory committee. Only one of
its members, La Motte reported, was dedicated to controlling the
opium traffic; the representative of China. The rest were dedicated
to preventing control from becoming effective, with the help of
ingenious procedural techniques. One British delegate would insist
upon open sessions, on principle. Another would agree, but put
the reasons why, in practice, this or that particular issue ought
more properly to be discussed in private; a proposition which
would be gratefully accepted by the other colonial powers. At
public sessions of the Opium Advisory Committee, the Chairman
would proceed with remarks like
<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Gentlemen, you have read Document 418? I take it there is no
discussion? Good. We will now pass on to Document 419.'
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Sometimes, too, the reference would be to a numbered paragraph
in a document which had not been made available to the press As
a result the 'open' sessions were productive mainly of gibberish.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
La Motte was, however, able to unearth one news story of interest:
that the British Government was proposing to extend its opium
operations in India. When criticised for over-production there,
the British had long replied that at least the opium was going
up in smoke; it was highly esteemed for that purpose, but no good
for extracting derivatives like morphine. Now, the League heard
that this was incorrect. Indian opium could produce admirable
morphine&#151;and the British had decided to go into morphine production
in India for themselves.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Alexander's travels</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
La Motte's conviction that the British were pretending to support
the League only to mask their own design&#151;the extraction of the
maximum revenue possible from opium&#151;was soon to be given confirmation.
In 1927 H. G. Alexander was offered a travelling fellowship to
investigate the drug problem in the Far East; and after his return
to England he published an account of what he had found. He made
no secret of his own view, derived from the time when his father
had been Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of the Opium
Traffic; this, he claimed, had simply made him more careful to
rely only on sources which could not be regarded as prejudiced
against the traffic, such as the reports of the Indian Revenue,
Customs and Excise Departments. And they revealed that it was
still Government policy to encourage the production not merely
of opium, but also of Indian hemp&#151;even when there were complaints
about the effects. Thus, in the report of the Excise Department
of the United Provinces for the financial year 1926-7, the inhabitants
of the Benares region were criticised as 'most depraved in respect
of the use of intoxicants, although it is the very centre of the
sacred soil of the Hindus'; yet the same report boasted that 'the
downward tendency in the sales of <I>charas</I> has now been arrested',
and disclosed that consideration was being given to a proposal
for the cultivation of more hemp to produce more <I>ganja</I>
and, therefore, more revenue. The sales of hard liquor were also
growing. When any suggestion was made that they ought to be reduced,
the reply would be along the lines given in the Excise Report
for the Bombay Presidency for 1925-6; attempts to curb legal sales
merely increased illicit traffic, so that there was 'no improvement
in temperance, increasing contempt for law and authority, and
demoralisation of the inadequate excise staff'&#151;as well as, of
course, 'loss of revenue'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
So while the British Government was professing to be taking measures
to reduce consumption of opium and hemp drugs, its agents in India
were in fact busy pushing sales in order to increase the colony's
revenue. Alexander did not know what should be done&#151;or could
be done. Control, he admitted, would not be easy, and might require
a different approach in different circumstances; as between town
and country, say. But of one thing he was certain: whatever policies
were adopted, they should not be left to Britain or to any other
colonial power to decide or enforce, or the situation would get
worse: with, in all probability, destructive consequences&#151;for
the colonial powers, as well as for their colonies.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Even in the limited sphere of drug and drink habits, the main
guilt of the West, for which sooner or later, the East will call
us to account, arises from the export of manufactured habitforming
drugs, such as morphine and cocaine, and from the export of spirits.
So long as we go to the East with these things in our hand, Chinese
and Indians and Malays are not likely to have much use for the
programmes of social reform that we carry in the other.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;  <H3>'The Smugglers' Reunion'</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In the meantime, Ellen La Motte had been trying to keep the American
public informed about what was going on at 'The Smugglers' Reunion',
as the disillusioned newspaper correspondents in Geneva dubbed
the League's Opium Committee. She had found an ally: the Italian
delegate, Signor Cavazzoni. He was probably simply there to make
mischief for Mussolini's amusement; but he made it entertainingly.
The Opium Committee's only response was to find a new way to make
things more difficult for correspondents; it was agreed to cut
down on the number of their proceedings printed&#151;'to save paper',
they claimed. La Motte was sure it was to enable them to doctor
the records. Events were to show she was right.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
At this point the British delegates created a surprise, by proposing
that the League should send a fact-finding mission to the Far
East to investigate the opium situation there. This proposal,
they could claim, showed they had nothing to hide. But as Gavit
had already warned in his <I>Opium,</I> published in 1925, it
was part of the colonial powers' game to keep the general public
under the impression that drug taking was an exotic Oriental vice,
slipping into Western countries through the docks and slums; whereas
in fact the real danger lay not in opium or hashish from the 'depraved'
East, but in the drugs which were coming from the expensively
equipped, skillfully and scientifically conducted pharmaceutical
laboratories of the 'civilised' West&#151;Britain, the United States,
France, Holland, but chiefly from Switzerland and Germany. The
fact-finding mission was being deliberately sent to the wrong
place. And the British had another motive, as one of their delegates
admitted to La Motte: 'what we really want is independent proof
of our inability to carry out our obligations under the Hague
Convention'. The British memorandum on the project emphasised
that in spite of the vigilance of their customs officials in colonies
like Malaya and Hong Kong, smuggling had greatly increased, and
now 'seriously embarrassed the Governments of those territories'.
Smuggled opium or morphine were indeed embarrassing: they reduced
the colonial revenue.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Having proposed the Commission, the British were in a good position
to limit its terms of reference, which they did by insisting that
only the distribution and consumption of opium&#151;not production&#151;should
be studied. Three Commissioners were chosen: a Belgian economist
and two members of the diplomatic corps, from Czechoslovakia and
Sweden. Their qualifications for selection remain obscure. They
held sittings in more than thirty different centres within the
space of seven months, which precluded any possibility of investigation
in depth&#151;though as they were careful to explain, staying longer
would not have helped, as the kind of information they were looking
for was not available. They had hoped to be shown the results
of research; but 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
in this field little has been done. Even the question of how much
morphine a smoker or an eater of opium absorbs is unsolved. Practically
every question connected with the opium smoking problem needs
scientific study. A few examples of problems requiring investigation
are the actual effects of opium smoking on the individual, the
effect of dross upon the consumer, the relative harmfulness of
smoking and eating, the question of heredity . . . and the possibility
of finding harmless substitutes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Commissioners, however, found no difficulty in collecting
evidence in the form of personal views about opium; and what they
heard surprised them. They had all three come out&#151;they explained
in their report&#151;with the prevailing Western notion of the deleterious
effects of opium on health, expecting to have it confirmed. But
among the witnesses they examined, members of the indigenous races
as well as the Chinese, they had found a widespread opinion that
opium smoking was not harmful, the arguments in its favour 'reaching
sometimes to a superstitious belief in the medicinal value thereof'.
They also repeatedly came in contact with the opinion, based on
personal experience, that opium used in moderation acted as a
useful mental and physical stimulant, the physical stimulus being
particularly valuable where people had to work hard under difficult
climatic conditions. Even those notorious establishments, the
'opium dens'&#151;or 'opium divans', as they were sometimes known&#151;were
far from being the haunts of depravity that Western fancy had
depicted. They were 'often the only available resting places for
the poor, and though they are not attractive, they are scarcely,
even at their worst, more repulsive than the localities where
the corresponding classes of the Western people consume beer or
stronger alcoholic beverages'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In general, the Commission's report did just what the British
had hoped it would do. It fed doubt into the minds of members
of the League whether opium should be regarded as a social menace;
and it actually conceded that the system of government monopolies
which had been established in British possessions was the best
solution, because it presented the only means by which price and
consumption could be controlled. Their policies, the British could
boast, had been vindicated. But their scheme, as things turned
out, had worked rather too well. It was not opium&#151;the report
went on to argue&#151;that was the real trouble. It was opium's derivatives,
morphine and heroin, 'a far more serious menace to the world'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It had not taken long before heroin's pretensions to be a non-addictive
drug had been exposed; and experience had shown that it was far
more addictive than cocaine. The timing of the recommendation,
too, was unfortunate for the manufacturing countries, as there
had just been a succession of embarrassing scandals in connection
with the statistics which each member nation was required to send
to the League. Between 1925 and 1926, the returns had revealed,
at least a hundred tons of morphine had disappeared&#151;in other
words, had been diverted from legal into illicit channels.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The countries concerned had manufactured the morphine, and declared
it, as bound by the 1925 Convention to do; the morphine had then
simply vanished. Some idea of what this disappearance involved
could be gauged from the fact that the world requirements of morphine
for medical and scientific purposes were put at less than forty
tons a year.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
A search promptly began for a scapegoat, and it was conveniently
provided by Turkey, which had refused to ratify the Convention.
If the Turks were to disclose their figures&#151;the rumour ran&#151;they
might prove revealing. The Turks thereupon disclosed them, and
they were indeed embarrassing; but not to the Turks. They showed
that Turkey had exported more than two tons of morphine and four
tons of heroin to European countries which had ratified the Convention.
Under the Convention, they were required to declare all such imports.
Assuming that Turkey would not disclose the deals, none of the
countries involved had made the required declarations. Those consignments,
too, had slipped into the illicit market.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
For still better measure, the Turks threw in the information that
in 1928 a single Alaska factory had manufactured nearly 9,000
lb. of heroin&#151;rather more than two and a half times the world's
estimated medical and scientific needs, that year, and 8,920 lb.
more than the amount which the French had declared, in the production
figures they provided to the League, for the three years 1926-8.
The French Government, protesting its innocence, closed down the
factory. The Turks were apparently expecting this move, as the
chemists who lost their jobs were offered work in new heroin factories
in Turkey,
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
How had the morphine and heroin been diverted ? The 'Naarden Case'
helped to clear up part of the mystery. Naarden, a Dutch firm,
had been ordering huge consignments from other countries, including
over 1,500 kg of heroin from a Swiss firm, and re-exporting them&#151;but
describing them as 'in transit', so that the Dutch Government
would not need to declare them in its returns to the League. But
there were no statistics to reveal the drug's ultimate destination.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The Blanco formula</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
These scandals attracted hostile publicity. It could no longer
be pretended that the Hague Convention, even as 'strengthened'
by the 1925 reforms, was working satisfactorily. But how could
it be improved ? The obvious solution was the one the Americans
and Chinese had urged on the other States at the Geneva Conference;
limitation of production of opium to the amount needed for medical
and scientific purposes. The delegates of the manufacturing countries
now announced that they were prepared to accept limitation, provided
agreement could be reached on how it was introduced.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
They were very careful to ensure that agreement would not be reached.
It was accepted that each of the manufacturing nations should
have a production quota; but none of them was prepared to accept
a smaller share of the market than it already enjoyed; and the
idea of simply freezing the share of each, at the level at which
it had been on some agreed date, satisfied nobody, because, it
was claimed, it would destroy freedom of choice for the purchaser
in the future, and infringe national sovereignty.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The apparent deadlock had been broken by a member of the League
Secretariat. A. E. Blanco, son of a Spanish father and a British
mother, had been in the British-run Chinese Customs Service; he
had given much thought to the matter. In future, he proposed,
any country which wished to use a dangerous drug for medical or
scientific purposes should declare in advance what supplies would
be needed, and where it proposed to obtain them. In this way it
would be possible to allocate quotas in advance the world over,
but without freezing the levels or restricting choice; so that
if some manufacturer made a particularly good brand of medical
heroin or morphine, he would be able to benefit the following
year from increased demand.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Blanco formula was the simple answer to the objections raised
by the manufacturing countries: altogether too simple for their
comfort. The Opium Advisory Committee&#151;the 'Smugglers Reunion'&#151;unable
to think of any objection to the proposal, decided simply to ignore
it. Blanco resigned in disgust, and there the matter would have
ended, had his scheme not been brought to the notice of the influential
American philanthropist, C. K. Crane.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Crane, struck by what he felt was the scheme's beautiful simplicity,
recommended it in a letter to the State Department. It would automatically
disclose the volume of the legitimate drug market in every country,
he pointed out; yet it would leave producers free to compete for
a larger share of the market, thereby minimising the need for
government intervention to apportion quotas. At the same time,
States' rights would not be infringed, as States could each decide
what supply of a drug they needed. Prompted by Crane, the State
Department drew the scheme to the attention of the Advisory Committee.
The committee reacted as before. As the delegates could think
of no valid objection, 'the only thing to do with the Scheme',
the British representative suggested, 'is to bury it'; and on
the motion of the Indian delegate, that 'the matter should simply
be dropped', it was.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Russell Pasha</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But it was soon revived, and from an unexpected quarter: Egypt,
then a British Protectorate, suffering from an uneasy sense of
thwarted nationality.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Towards the end of the nineteenth century the authorities there
had become increasingly worried by the number of young men who
took to smoking opium or hashish, deserting families, jobs and
society. Various measures had been adopted to control drug-taking.
Hashish had sometimes been subjected to a heavy duty; sometimes
prohibited, with heavy penalties, even death, for anybody caught
with it. The frequent alterations of policy, though, were an indication
of how ineffective the laws were; largely because they rarely
applied to foreigners. The better the law was enforced in Egypt,
the higher rose the price of opium or hashish; and the greater
the profit would be to foreigners who could import the drugs with
impunity and sell them through illicit channels, until the price
came down again.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Malcolm Muggeridge was to describe in his autobiography how, when
he went to teach at a school in Egypt in the 1920s, he observed
that the students at Cairo University often seemed to be 'faraway,
lost in some dream of erotic bliss; a consequence no doubt, in
the case of many of them, of their addiction to hashish, widespread
among the <I>effendi</I> class, and prevalent among the <I>fellahin,</I>
particularly the ones who had moved into the towns' The deleterious
effects of this addiction, Muggeridge recalled; were then universally
taken for granted,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
and the Egyptian authorities, following a plan of modernisation
and national revival on the general lines of Kemal Ataturk's in
Turkey, spent a lot of money and effort in an attempt to stamp
it out. Russell Pasha, the head policeman and the last Englishman
to hold the post, was particularly active in trying to prevent
hashish getting into the country, and in reducing indulgence in
it . . . if anyone had suggested that all this endeavour was misplaced
because hashish did little harm, and was anyway non-addictive,
the suggestion would have been received with incredulity and derision.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
And Muggeridge went on to use the recollection as the text for
a sermon denouncing the apologists for cannabis half a century
later; 'I know of no better exemplification of the death wish
in the heart of our way of life than this determination to bring
about the legalisation of hashish, so that it may ravage the West
as it has the Middle and Far East.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The passage in his autobiography happens also to be an interesting
exemplification of the way in which moral attitudes can colour
memories. 'Russell Pasha'&#151;Thomas Wentworth Russell&#151;did indeed
devote a great deal of time and energy to trying to keep hashish
out of Egypt. Those were his orders, and he carried them out with
intelligence and integrity. But he did not think hashish was a
menace. He divided drugs into two categories 'white', and 'black'.
Hashish&#151;'the vice of the city slums'&#151;was in the white category;
it did 'comparatively little harm', he felt, and could not be
held responsible for the country's addiction problem. It would
be more sensible, he believed, to legalise the white drugs. According
to his friend and biographer Baron d'Erlanger, he announced that
'he was seriously considering some form of government monopoly
whereby hashish would be grown domestically, and its smoking would
be licensed and made to produce revenue for the Egyptian Government,
instead of costing enormous sums for the prohibition and, in addition,
draining the country of the money which was sent abroad to pay
for the foreign grown raw material'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The idea proved unacceptable to his superiors; Russell had to
continue to try to prevent hashish smuggling into Egypt. But his
main preoccupation was with the black drugs, heroin (which a missionary,
Herbert Hayes, identified as the main threat as early as 1922)
and cocaine (according to a report from the American consul in
Cairo in 1923, fashionable men and women could be seen stopping
their automobiles so that they 'could buy their stuff, and sniff
it on the sidewalk'). It was heroin, though, Russell recalled
in his autobiography, 'which nearly killed Egypt'. D'Erlanger
agreed; by 1929, when Russell was appointed Director of the Egyptian
Central Narcotics Bureau, it had pushed opium, hashish and cocaine
into the background. Heroin not merely provided 'a sensation of
pleasant stupefaction, of happy contented drunkenness, of deadening
comfortable drowsiness', which was what people had originally
taken it for, but also 'a buoyancy of spirits, increased imagination,
temporarily enlarged brain power, and a capacity to think of things
which they would not otherwise have imagined'. But the price was
a disturbing addiction rate. One in four of Egypt's adult male
population, Russell estimated, became a black drug addict.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
His first task had been to find how the heroin was coming into
the country; something that had baffled the customs officials.
From the start, according to d'Erlanger, 'a certain unromantic
and sordid aspect was recognised and faced squarely; namely that
the obtaining of reliable information is overwhelmingly a matter
of money'. It was decided to pay informers so liberally that giving
the required information would be more profitable than smuggling.
There was an immediate and gratifying response, revealing where
the heroin was to be found; 'in cases of olives; in tins of powdered
glue, of butter; in barrels of tomato sauce, of oil, and of wine;
in sacks of prunes; in millstones; in stoves with false bottoms:
in carpenters' lasts; in the soles and heels of shoes; and even
by means of tubes concealed in what Mrs. Grundy might have called
'the most intimate recesses of the person' (a method which, d'Erlanger
observed, 'starts quite an amusing line of thought when one remembers
which was the most usual way of taking heroin for its pleasurable
effects').
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But as Russell soon realised, the men who were running the traffic
were never caught, because they took good care that the actual
smuggler, who might be caught, did not know who they were. As
soon as they found their consignments were being intercepted,
they switched them into different channels; and any temporary
reduction in the supply of heroin available in Egypt actually
helped them, by raising its price, to afford the increased outlay
in payments to couriers, and in bribes to customs officials And
Russell found, as Commissioner Lin had done, that informers would
realise they could again make more money by assisting the smugglers
than by assisting the police; or, they could have it both ways
by tipping the police off to the occasional consignment, while
helping the bulk of the heroin to go through.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Russell was right; it was 'overwhelmingly a matter of money'.
There was more than enough money in a single small tin labelled
beans, but containing heroin, to persuade many officials to do
no more than wink, as the crate full of tins of beans went through;
and the financial resources of the traffickers stretched much
further than those of the police. For Egypt to try to suppress
heroin on her own, Russell realised, was a futile exercise. It
could only be got rid of through an international agreement. It
was with that objective that he went to Geneva to put Egypt's
case to the League. Largely by the force of his personality, he
finally goaded the delegates into activity.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
For all his achievement, though, in alerting public opinion to
the limitations of international control over the drug traffic
Russell did not disguise from himself the limitations of the general
policy which he had been called on to carry out in Egypt. Whenever
by energetic measures he succeeded in limiting for a while the
supply of 'black' drugs, thereby pushing up the price beyond the
means of many Egyptians who ordinarily took them, the enforced
abstinence, he found, did them little good. They turned, instead,
to a mixture of tobacco and henbane&#151;impossible to deal with
effectively by police measures, as tobacco was too well established
to ban, and henbane grew wild. They even started to drink 'stewed'
tea, in the quantities required to intoxicate them, with lamentable
consequences 'to both their pockets and health'. So worried did
the Egyptian authorities become that in the 1930s they closed
the teashops, and smashed the utensils used to make and serve
the tea. The addicts found other ways to get it. 'They are always
searching for a stimulant', an Egyptian landlord told a committee
of enquiry in 1933; and as they could no longer afford the harder
drugs, or hashish, 'they are now finding it in this vile brew,
to the damage of their health'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The reason people became addicted in this way, the landlord suggested,
would make an interesting subject for social and medical research.
Russell would have agreed. He was a shrewd enough observer to
realise that it was not the drugs, but the disposition to take
them, that mattered. Why, he wondered, were the Egyptians so susceptible?
Might the responsibility lie with the spread of parasite-carried
diseases like bilharzia, following the changes in the level of
the Nile as a result of the construction of the Aswan Dam? Whatever
the cause, a drug or drugs was invariably found to assuage the
craving. Coffee, hashish, opium, heroin . . . and now, stewed
tea; 'and so it goes on'.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The 1931 Convention</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
And so it went on; at Geneva, too, though not quite so smoothly
as before for the members of the Opium Advisory Committee. When
Russell arrived in Geneva in 1930 as Egypt's delegate to the Committee,
the scene there was quickly transformed: internally, by his energetic
efforts to find ways round the obstacles they had put up, and
externally by the world-wide publicity his ideas and speeches
attracted. When a meeting of delegates from the manufacturing
countries that autumn failed to reach agreement, because of their
unwillingness to accept quotas, the Blanco formula was revived,
and in the summer of 1931, a modified version of it was at last
accepted. In future, estimates of production and importation were
to be made by each member country, based on medical and scientific
needs and submitted, with explanatory memoranda, five months in
advance. All exports of heroin were to cease; all illicit heroin
seized was to be destroyed or rendered harmless; and all important
cases of illicit trafficking were to be reported to the League.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
From the legal point of view, the 1931 Convention was unique;
the first not merely to apply the principles of a controlled economy
to a group of commodities by international agreement, but also
to regulate all phases of the production of dangerous drugs from
the time the raw material entered the factory to the final acceptance
of the finished product by hospital, laboratory, or chemist's
shop. Its impact appeared to be instantaneous; by 1932 the price
of raw opium was down to a quarter of what it had been in 1929.
The Advisory Committee, which for so long had resisted the introduction
of any such controls, now proudly boasted how well they were working.
The figures presented by the manufacturing countries showed that
they had begun to put the scheme into effect even before it had
been formally ratified; the amounts being manufactured had 'closely
approximated to, or even fallen below, the amounts which appear
to be required for legitimate consumption'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Gradually it became clear, though, that the fall in the price
of opium had little to do with the new Convention. It was the
great slump that had drastically reduced demand; the resulting
surplus of opium and its derivatives had pushed down the price;
and some governments were restricting the production of narcotics
mainly in the hope of keeping the prices from falling further.
When the international drug traffic began to recover, it was seen
that the Convention was of little help in controlling it. The
few countries which had refused to ratify were able to cater for
illicit demand, wherever it was to be found; and modifications
to the Blanco formula reduced its effectiveness. The advance estimates
which countries presented to the League of their drug requirements,
it was agreed, did not have to be precise. Illicit narcotics,
if seized, need not, after all, be destroyed. And there were no
sanctions to employ against governments which failed to fulfill
their pledges.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The collapse of the Convention was described by Ferdinand Tuohy
in his <I>Inside Dope,</I> published in 1934, illustrated by the
'news flashes' which he had collected while writing it; ranging
from the discovery that 251 carrier pigeons were being employed
by the inmates of a U.S. prison to keep them supplied with narcotics,
to the report of the discovery by the French authorities of a
smuggling trick of the kind recorded a century earlier by Commissioner
Lin; a zinc-lined coffin from the Levant had been found to contain
heroin, as well as the corpse, the plan being to allow the committal
service and the burial to proceed, and 'for those in the deal
on this side to act the ghoul later'. In spite of the optimism
generated by Russell Pasha's impact at Geneva, Tuohy claimed,
'the dope stream is experiencing small difficulty in finding new
channels'. And worse would follow. Earlier drugs&#151;he cited hashish&#151;had
at least been 'natural'; it was the alkaloids, the derivatives,
which were disastrous. And now, they were being duplicated by
chemists; one of his 'news flashes' concerned the invention of
a new synthetic drug, far stronger than morphine.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Tuohy's fears were confirmed by S. H. Bailey's more academic survey
of the international campaign against drugs, published in 1936.
The third phase of the campaign, as Bailey described it&#151; the
first had been initiated at The Hague, and the second by the revised
Geneva Convention in 1925&#151;had not, he felt, been operational
long enough to be fairly judged; but already administrative difficulties
were making themselves felt. Any scheme for the limitation of
drugs had to be
<BLOCKQUOTE>
grafted on to the diverse legal and administrative roots of more
than sixty independent States with their numerous and widely scattered
protectorates, colonies, and leased or mandated territories. Desirable
international measures may be obstructed by constitutional barriers
in one country, or public sentiment in another. Handsome allowance
has to be made for the variations in the efficiency, experience
and reliability of administrative agencies in different territories.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
And by 1936, the chances that these administrative problems would
be solved was small. The League's authority was everywhere crumbling.
The Japanese had defied it by occupying China north of the Great
Wall; and although they could claim that by setting up their Manchukuo
opium monopoly they were only following the British colonial pattern,
as accepted by the League's own fact-finding mission, it seemed
improbable in view of their record that they would use their powers
to reduce production. Visiting Manchukuo for <I>The Times</I>
in 1935 Peter Fleming asked himself the question, 'is the monopoly
a crusade or a racket ?'. On the evidence, he decided, it was
clearly a racket. Opium dens had been opened to all, even teenagers;
consumption was increasing; and the monopoly was already making
huge profits&#151;as the Japanese authorities cynically acknowledged,
by imprinting a flowering poppy on their Manchukuo coins.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But even if the Japanese and all other producing countries had
been willing to co-operate, Bailey warned, the effort might be
futile, because of the development of synthetic drugs; 'the infinitely
varied and variable series of narcotic substances which competitive
research continues to discover and the medical profession of the
world to demand'. And it would never be easy to control such enterprises
because they were highly mobile; 'operations can be begun with
little preparation in one centre and, when economic, legal or
administrative conditions become less favourable, transferred
to another'. It was a prophetic statement; but for the time, the
drug manufacturers of illicit drugs hardly needed such assistance.
With Mussolini leaving the League, and Hitler ignoring it, its
authority was further eroded, and even the semblance of international
control of the drug traffic disappeared.

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
WHILE THE LEAGUE HAD BEEN WRESTLING WITH THE PROBLEM OF 
controlling the international drug traffic, its member States had been going
their individual ways, some paying little attention to the League's
requests. The nation which came closest to carrying out the League's
recommendations was, ironically, not a member: the United States;
and the consequences of the methods it chose to adopt to stamp
out drug-taking were to prove even more disastrous, though on
a smaller scale, than Prohibition.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The Harrison Act</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Harrison Narcotics Act, passed in 1914, was chiefly designed
to restrict the use of opium and its derivatives to medical purposes,
the doctor being permitted to prescribe them 'in the course of
his professional practice only'. But the limits of what would
constitute professional practice were left undefined. Was the
doctor allowed to prescribe heroin to addicts&#151;the maintenance
dose, as it came to be known? Or did this fall outside his professional
competence ? The law enforcement officers took the view that it
was no part of the profession's duty to indulge the addict with
his drugs. Doctors who continued to provide patients with the
maintenance dose found themselves liable to be arrested&#151; which,
even if they were not jailed, meant that they would face professional
ruin. So the addict&#151;as <I>American Medicine</I> commented soon
after the Act came into effect&#151;is 'deprived of the medical care
he urgently needs; open, above-board sources from which he formerly
obtained his drug supply are closed to him, and he is driven to
the underworld where he can get his drug'. The underworld had
no difficulty in supplying him. By the end of the First World
War, an investigating committee found, the problem of addiction
was more serious than ever in American cities. The illicit traffic
in opiates had increased until it just about equalled the legal
traffic, and the number of addicts had risen to around a million.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Predictably, the committee recommended tougher laws, and tougher
enforcement: and in 1924 an Act was passed prohibiting the importation
of heroin&#151;this being the policy the United States delegates
were trying to persuade the League of Nations Opium Conference
to accept. The effect was rapid, and striking. Hitherto the profession
had made little distinction between morphine and heroin addicts,
the general assumption being that though heroin was the more addictive,
the two drugs were not significantly different in their effects.
But&#151;according to Edward Brecher in his survey of the period
in <I>Licit and Illicit Drugs</I>&#151;hardly had the law been changed
than morphine, though easier and cheaper to get, almost disappeared
from the black market. So far from stopping the traffic, the <I>Illinois
Medical Journal</I> complained in June 1926, the 'well-meaning
blunderers' who had passed the Act had ensured that those who
dealt in heroin could now 'make double the money from the poor
unfortunates upon whom they prey'. All that the United States
Government was doing was ensuring the prosperity of the bootleggers
of narcotics, in the same way as they had ensured the prosperity
of the bootleggers of alcohol, at enormous cost to the nation.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The Rolleston Committee</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
What would have happened&#151;it was often asked&#151;if the American
Government, instead of denying addicts their maintenance dose,
had allowed them to have it on prescription? The easiest comparison
was with Britain, which had had a similar problem with addiction
to opiates in the early part of the century, arising out of ill-advised
prescribing habits and the boom in patent medicines; and which
had also passed a law, the 1920 Dangerous Drugs Act, designed
to bring them under control. When the issue came up whether the
maintenance dose should be allowed, however, the decision lay
not with the law officers, as in America, but with the Ministry
of Health. The Ministry decided to appoint a committee, under
Sir Humphrey Rolleston, to advise on it; and the committee sent
one of its members, Dr. Harry Campbell, to the United States to
observe how the Harrison law was working.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
As a consequence of the law, Dr. Campbell reported,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a vast clandestine commerce has grown up in that country. The
small bulk of these drugs renders the evasion of the law comparatively
easy, and the country is overrun by an army of peddlers who extort
exorbitant prices from their helpless victims. It appears that
not only has the Harrison law failed to diminish the number of
drug-takers&#151;some contend, indeed, that it has actually worsened
it; for without curtailing the supply of the drug it has sent
the price up tenfold, and this has had the effect of impoverishing
the poorer class of addicts and reducing them to a condition of
such abject misery as to render them incapable of gaining an honest
livelihood.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Rolleston Committee was exclusively medical in its composition.
One of the most cherished tenets of the medical profession was
that the doctor had a right to prescribe whatever he thought suitable
for his patients, with or without the State's sanction. Dr. Campbell
had given the Committee just the kind of evidence they needed
to justify the continuance of this policy. They recommended that
doctors should be allowed to prescribe heroin not simply in the
course of treatment, but also to the patient who, 'while capable
of leading a useful and fairly normal life as long as he takes
a certain non-progressive quantity, usually small, of the drug
of addiction, ceases to be able to do so when the regular allowance
is withdrawn'. The medical profession in Britain having more prestige
and more influence than the American, the recommendation was accepted.
As a result, though there was always a black market in the opiates
between the wars, it remained very small. The addict who could
get his heroin for a few pence on prescription was not going to
pay ten times as much to a peddler.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In the United States, heroin addiction grew progressively more
serious; for reasons given in 1936 by August Vollmer, who had
been Chief of Police in Berkeley, California, and subsequently
a Professor of Police Administration in Chicago:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Stringent laws, spectacular police drives, vigorous prosecution
and imprisonment of addicts and peddlers have proved not only
useless and enormously expensive as means of correcting this evil,
but they are also unjustifiably and unbelievably cruel in their
application to the unfortunate drug victims. Repression has driven
this vice underground and produced the narcotic smugglers and
supply agents, who have grown wealthy out of this evil practice
and who, by devious methods, have stimulated traffic in drugs.
Finally, and not the least of the evils associated with repression,
the helpless addict has been forced to resort to crime in order
to get money for the drug.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Drug addiction, Vollmer went on to argue, was not a police problem&#151;'it
never has been and never can be solved by policemen'; it was a
medical problem. Instead of penal sanctions, 'there should be
intelligent treatment of the incurables in outpatient clinics,
hospitalization of those not too far gone to respond to therapeutic
measures, and application of the prophylactic principles which
medicine applies to all scourges of mankind'.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Marihuana: Harry Anslinger</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Vollmer was a respected figure&#151;he was a former President of
the International Association of Chiefs of Police. But how little
attention was paid to his opinions could be gauged from the fact
that the following year, Congress passed a law bringing yet another
drug under federal prohibition: Indian hemp.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Before 1900, hemp had hardly rated as a drug in the United States.
This was not because of any lack of availability; in the South,
it had long been one of the main cash crops&#151;grown by, among
others, George Washington, and encouraged by later administrators,
chiefly to provide fibres. It was no more regarded as a plant
drug than the morning glory&#151;at least by the whites; they preferred
their tobacco and alcohol. Only the Southern black slaves took
it; as Richard Burton, who liked to compare different types of
hemp as other men like to compare different wines, observed when
he visited the region. He was interested to discover that 'few
of their owners had ever heard of it'. So little were its narcotic
properties known, let alone worried about, that S. S. Boyce's
treatise on hemp, published in New York in 1900, contained no
reference to them; and that same year the U.S. Department of Agriculture
announced that it had decided to import experimental quantities
of 'superior varieties of hemp seed' from the East, for experiments
to see how they would grow in America.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Drugs made from hemp were used to a small extent in medicines;
and the Department, worried by the growing cost of imported drugs,
and with a view to making the United States self-sufficient in
her requirements, also embarked on a systematic survey over the
next few years to find how much was needed of hemp and other plant
drugs, and how and where they could best be grown. Experimental
farms were established, at which tests could be made; and hemp
was found to do very well in the Eastern and upper Southern States.
Farms to produce it commercially were accordingly started in Pennsylvania,
Virginia, and South Carolina. During the war, farmers were encouraged
to produce still more, until they almost fulfilled the country's
entire requirements; a feat which was held to be greatly to their
credit by Henry Fuller in his survey of American drugs, published
in 1922.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
During the 1920s, however, marihuana&#151;as it came to be described
when taken for non-medical purposes&#151;began to acquire a sinister
reputation; partly owing to the stories coming out of Egypt, where
hashish was still getting blamed for the addiction rate; partly
because it began to spread north into States of the Union where
it had not been known before. Some of them banned it; and at the
time the Federal Bureau of Narcotics was set up under the wing
of the Treasury Department in Washington in 1930, there was a
move to get marihuana banned throughout the country. The Treasury
was unimpressed. 'A great deal of public interest has been aroused
by newspaper articles,' its report claimed in 1931, 'appearing
from time to time on the evils of the abuse of marihuana, or Indian
hemp. This publicity tends to magnify the extent of the evil and
lends color to the inference that there is an alarming spread
of the improper use of the drug, whereas the actual increase in
such use may not have been inordinately large.' 
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Chief of the new Narcotics Bureau, however, did not share
the Treasury's view. Harry Anslinger had been Assistant Commissioner
of Prohibition, and was understandably anxious to wipe out the
memory of his failure to make it work. He was young&#151;still in
his thirties&#151;ambitious; and filled with a deep repugnance for
drugs dating back, by his own account, to an episode in his childhood.
He had been born in Pennsylvania, near a township in which one
adult out of ten was reputed to be an opium addict; and as a twelve-year-old,
he heard a woman screaming in agony for the drug, a sound he never
forgot. He had come to feel the same horror of marihuana.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Federal Bureau of Narcotics, however, was originally drawn
into the campaign against marihuana less by Anslinger's antipathy
to the drug than for administrative simplicity. It had becomeobvious that narcotics could not be adequately controlled so long
as each State had a different set of regulations, and a national
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws had been considering
how best to unify them. In 1932 they put forward a draft narcotics
law which, it was hoped, all States would introduce, imposing
prohibition except for medical purposes. At this stage, the decision
whether or not to classify hemp as a narcotic within the meaning
of the Act was left optional. Anslinger, regarding this as unsatisfactory,
determined to arouse public opinion to the marihuana menace. His
Bureau therefore prepared a brochure in which it was claimed that,
'those who are accustomed to habitual use of the drug are said
eventually to develop a delirious rage after its administration
during which they are temporarily, at least, irresponsible, and
prone to commit violent crimes'; and that prolonged use was 'said
to produce mental deterioration'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
'Said to' was a favourite Bureau phrase when there was no evidence
who had done the saying. Anslinger had other devices, too, to
rouse fear of marihuana. It had dropped out of general medical
usage, he claimed, because its effects were too unpredictable.
This was true; doctors did not find it easy to prescribe the appropriate
dosage, because individual reactions were so varied. But Anslinger's
interpretation of 'unpredictability' was his own. A patient, he
explained, might not react at all; but he might 'go berserk'.
And the young were particularly at risk; much of the prevailing
crime, vice and gang warfare were due to the drug.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Bureau's report for 1933 promised a propaganda campaign against
marihuana. For a while, it did not 'take'; <I>The Reader's Guide
to Periodical Literature,</I> Brecher was later to find, listed
no article on the subject in the ten years 1925-35&#151;itself an
indication of how little alarm the drug had been causing. Then,
the flow began; and most of the articles either acknowledged the
help of the Bureau, or showed internal evidence of having accepted
it. Anslinger himself gave network radio broadcasts to arouse,
as he put it, 'an intelligent and sympathetic public interest,
helpful to the administration of the narcotic laws'. They emphasised
marihuana's close relationship with hashish, and attributed to
it 'a growing list of crimes, including murder'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Anslinger's main aim was to shake Congress into action; and in
this he succeeded. When in 1937 the Treasury introduced a Federal
Marihuana Bill, putting the drug into the same category as the
narcotics controlled by the Harrison Act, Congressmen were so
little concerned to dispute the Bureau brief that the only serious
opposition came from representatives of the bird seed industry.
They managed, just in time, to put over their case that hemp seed,
whatever it might do to humans, did only good to birds, upon whom
it had no observable narcotic effects, and whose health&#151;and
plumage&#151;suffered without it.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Having committed himself to prohibition of marihuana, Anslinger
was aware he would need to justify himself by making a better
job of enforcement than he had been able to do with either alcohol
or heroin. The Bureau's campaign through the press intensified.
In the same month&#151;July&#151;that the Act went through, an article
by Anslinger appeared in the <I>American Magazine</I> purporting
to recount some of the crimes committed under the influence of
marihuana, which bore an interesting resemblance to those which
had been described to an Indian Hemp Drugs Commission, including
a murder in Florida:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When officers arrived at the home they found the youth staggering
about in a human slaughterhouse. With an axe he had killed his
father, mother, two brothers and a sister. He seemed to be in
a daze.... He had no recollection of having committed the multiple
crime. The officers knew him ordinarily as a sane, rather quiet
young man; now he was pitifully crazed. They sought the reason.
The boy said he had been in the habit of smoking something which
youthful friends called 'muggle' a childish name for marihuana.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Anslinger omitted to provide any evidence that the smoking of
muggle had been in any way responsible for the crime; but with
his authority for it, the incident was to be used again and again,
in later articles, by journalists who had found it among the files.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In one respect, the campaign was a little too successful for Anslinger's
peace of mind. He had secured a fervent supporter in Earle Albert
Rowell, a hot-gospeller, who had been touring America lecturing
audiences on marihuana's effects. The drug, according to Rowell's
thesis:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;  1 Destroys willpower, making a jellyfish of the user. He cannot
say no.
<BR>&nbsp;  
2 Eliminates the line between right and wrong . . .
<BR>&nbsp;  
3 Above all, causes crime, fills the victim with an irrepressible
urge to violence.
<BR>&nbsp;  
4 Incites to revolting immoralities, including rape and murder.
<BR>&nbsp;  
5 Causes many accidents, both industrial and automobile.
<BR>&nbsp;  
6 Ruins careers for ever.
<BR>&nbsp;  
7 Causes insanity as its speciality.
<BR>&nbsp;  
8 <I>Either in self-defence or as a means of revenue, users make
smokers of others, thus perpetuating evil.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The italicised part of Rowell's creed was an embarrassment to
the Narcotics Bureau, because it related to another of Rowell's
beliefs; that in order to stamp out marihuana, it would be necessary
also to ban tobacco, because smoking cigarettes led young people
on to smoking marihuana. 'Slowly, insidiously', Rowell claimed,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
for over three hundred years, Lady Nicotine was setting the stage
for a grand climax. The long years of tobacco-using were but an
introduction and training for marihuana use. Tobacco which was
first smoked in a pipe, then as a cigar, and at last as a cigarette,
demanded more and more of itself until its supposed pleasures
palled, and some of the tobacco victims looked about for something
stronger. Tobacco was no longer potent enough.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was no part of Anslinger's strategy to add to his difficulties
with a campaign against tobacco: Rowell was repudiated.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Marihuana was now officially a 'black' or 'hard' drug. What this
was going to mean was forecast by Dr. Henry Smith Williams in
1938.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With the aid of newspaper propaganda already started, an interest
will be created in the alleged allurements of marihuana smoking;
and the army of inspectors sent out to explore the millions of
fields in which the weed may be grown need only apply, with slight
modifications, the methods learned in the conduct of the narcotics
racket, in order to develop a marihuana industry that could eclipse
the billion dollar illicit narcotics racket of today. Racketeers
. . . should have no difficulty at all in developing a five billion
dollar racket with marihuana&#151; provided only that the press can
be induced to stimulate curiosity by giving the drug publicity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
And the press, fed with more horror stories by Anslinger, duly
did its worst.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The La Guardia Report</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Up to this point, there had been no attempt seriously to investigate
the effects of marihuana in the United States. But when the Mayor
of New York, Fiorello La Guardia, was urged to initiate a campaign
against the drug, he recalled that many years before he had been
impressed by a report on the subject by an army board in Panama,
'which had emphasised the relative harmlessness of the drug and
the fact that it played a very little role, if any, in problems
of delinquency and crime in the Canal Zone'. In 1939, with the
help of the New York Academy of Medicine, La Guardia set up a
committee consisting of twenty-eight doctors, pharmacologists,
psychiatrists and sociologists, who were allowed the time and
the facilities to do what half a century earlier the Indian Hemp
Drugs Commission, for all its thoroughness, had not attempted:
scientific tests of the drug, in controlled conditions.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The outcome of the enquiry was remarkably similar to that of its
predecessors. The behaviour of marihuana smokers&#151;the Chairman
of the Committee, Dr. George B. Wallace, wrote in his summary
of its conclusions&#151;was ordinarily 'of a friendly, sociable character.
Aggressiveness and belligerency are not commonly seen.' No direct
relation had been found between marihuana and crimes of violence.
There was no evidence that it was an aphrodisiac. Smoking could
be stopped without any resulting mental or physical distress comparable
with withdrawal symptoms after opiates; and there was no sign
that smokers acquired tolerance of its effects, compelling them
to take more. On the contrary, an excessive dose reversed the
usually pleasant effects. 'Marihuana does not change the basic
personality structure of the individual. It lessens inhibitions
and this brings out what is latent in his thoughts and emotions,
but it does not evoke responses which would otherwise be totally
alien to him.' No mental or physical deterioration of a kind which
could be attributed to it had been diagnosed even among those
who had taken the drug for years. So far from its being a menace,
'the lessening of inhibitions and repression, the euphoric state,
the feeling of adequacy, the freer expression of thoughts and
ideas, and the increase in appetite for food brought about by
marihuana, suggest therapeutic possibilities'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The American Medical Association reacted angrily to the implication
that it had failed to recognise cannabis's potential. 'Public
officials will do well to disregard this unscientific, uncritical
study', the AMA <I>Journal</I> urged on April 28th, 1948, 'and
continue to regard marihuana as a menace wherever it is purveyed'.
The damage, it feared, had already been done&#151;to judge by the
account of some 'tearful parents' who had noticed a mental deterioration
in their son, 'evident even to their lay minds' and found he had
been smoking 'tea' (the then current slang); when taxed with it,
he had cited the committee's report&#151;which he had read about
in a pop music magazine under the heading <I>'Light up! Report
finds &quot;tea&quot; a Good Kick!'</I>&#151;as his justification.
Anslinger was of the same mind. The report's 'giddy sociology
and medical mumbo-jumbo', he was later to complain in one of his
autobiographies, 'put extra millions in the pockets of the hoods'.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Marihuana: the second phase</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Following the report of the La Guardia Committee, voices were
heard periodically in the United States suggesting that even if
its research had not been perfect, the results at least confirmed
that there were no known serious hazards from marihuana to the
individual or to society. Would it not be as well, then, to give
up the apparently futile attempt to ban it, and to concentrate
instead on the campaign against heroin and the other hard drugs?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Anslinger found the proposal intolerable. To block it, he began
to advance a new argument, contradicting views he had himself
held earlier. In 1937 he had assured Congress that marihuana did
not lead on to hard drug addiction, because he wanted to prove
that marihuana addicts were, as he put it to Congress, 'an entirely
different class', who were made violent by the drug, rather than
by the need to find money to pay for it. They knew nothing of
heroin, he asserted, and 'did not go in that direction'. But by
1956, when new forms of drug control were being debated, Anslinger
realised that he could no longer rely on Congressmen accepting
his link between marihuana and violence, exploded by the La Guardia
findings. He would have to find some fresh reason for maintaining
prohibition of the drug. Marihuana, he now admitted, was not a
'controlling factor' in crime; the real danger was 'that marihuana,
if used over a long period, does lead to heroin addiction'. His
expert advice was accepted.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
When it began to become obvious, later in the 1960s, that the
campaign to stamp out marihuana was not succeeding, and that the
habit was spreading rapidly throughout the country, particularly
among the youth, State legislatures displayed the by now reflex
action. They passed laws to intensify enforcement, and to increase
penalties. Edward Brecher has since listed them in his <I>Licit
and Illicit Drugs,</I> including:
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Alabama: mandatory sentence for the possession of a marihuana
cigarette: five years. Second offence, up to forty years. No suspended
sentences or probation permitted.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Illinois: for first offence of selling marihuana, ten years to
life.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Louisiana: mandatory sentence for possession, first offence, five
to fifteen years hard labour.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Missouri: life sentence for first offence of sale, second of possession.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Rhode Island: mandatory ten years for possession with intent to
sell.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
And in Massachusetts anybody found in a place where marihuana
was kept, or in the company of anybody possessing it, could receive
a five-year sentence. At the same time, the campaign was intensified
on the federal level. In 1960 there had been 169 arrests in connection
with marihuana; in 1965 there were 7,000, and the following year,
15,000.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The campaign was a humiliating failure, for two main reasons.
One was that it proved impossible to stop smuggling. The long
border with Mexico, in particular, was easily breached&#151;often
by the owners of the 80,000 cars which, by the late 1960s, were
passing into Mexico and back into California every weekend (at
one checkpoint there were eighteen lanes, which did not make for
secure customs enforcement). But the main reason was the same
as under Prohibition forty years earlier: that enforcement lacked
solid support from public opinion. The young were often on marihuana's
side; and parents were gradually learning to live with the knowledge
that their children were not going to be stopped from breaking
the law.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was also becoming apparent that none of the terrible consequences
Anslinger had forecast were manifesting themselves Marihuana caused
no deaths, and no addiction of the kind which afflicted takers
of the opiates or of alcohol; nor were its takers more prone to
mania, to violence, or to crime than the rest of the community.
By the time President Nixon, whose views reflected Anslinger's,
set up his own enquiry&#151;which he took care to 'load', appointing
nine of the thirteen members himself, and leaving them and the
public in no doubt as to what he expected of them&#151;the campaign
against marihuana was disintegrating. 'There is increasing evidence,'
Dr. James Carey of the University of California told them, 'that
we are approaching a situation similar to that at the time when
the Volstead Act was repealed.' On the one hand, there were the
savage penalties; on the other, a breakdown of enforcement. The
police, though willing enough to make raids on hippy camps, did
not relish the idea of making sweeps through the massed ranks
of fans at pop festivals; still less, of raiding the homes of
the G.I.s&#151;sometimes officers&#151;who had brought the habit back
with them from Vietnam.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Politicians, too, could no longer be so sure that a hard line
on drugs would win them electoral support. In some States, tacit
agreements were reached to leave University campuses to discipline
themselves over marihuana; fines for possession become nominal.
In the winter of 1972 the Consumers' Union pronounced 'marihuana
is here to stay. No conceivable law enforcement programme can
curb its availability', and called for a new Act to introduce
orderly controls on cultivation, production and distribution.
In 1973 Oregon took a tentative step towards legislation, by converting
possession of small quantities of marihuana into a 'violation'&#151;comparable
to a parking offence&#151;rather than a crime. And when the Shafer
Committee reported, to Nixon's disgust it recommended that possession
of small quantities of cannabis should cease to be a criminal
offence..
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Britain and cannabis</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It might have been expected that the British, aware of the good
fortune in escaping the consequences of the United States' heroin
policy, would have taken care not to ban cannabis themselves.
But the drug was rarely used socially in Britain, and as the plant
had continued to resist conversion into a standardised potion,
or pill, it had been falling out of medical use. When it was introduced
by the West Indian immigrants after the Second World War, it was
known only through the lingering legends of the Arabian nights,
and the Assassins. And for a time, it was allowed to circulate
in what became semi-ghettoes where the immigrants lived.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Around 1950, it began to spread out through much the same channels
as it had in the United States, chiefly through musicians and
their fans; and stories about the way the drug was corrupting
the nation's youth began to appear in the newspapers. They were
loaded with menace: readers were reminded that cannabis was really
hashish, the drug of the Assassins, and told that it was being
pushed by coloured dope peddlers. Britain had no Narcotics Squad,
and no Harry Anslinger; but it had Dr. Donald McIntosh Johnson,
later to be Conservative M.P. for Carlisle, whose <I>Indian Hemp:</I>
a Social Menace sounded the alarm in 1952. In it he described
how the respectable 'Mr. A' had been slipped a 'Mickey Finn',
which had driven him into so manic a mental condition that he
had had to be certified, and incarcerated for a few days in a
mental hospital. The drug used, Dr. Johnson claimed, was cannabis;
and he went on to explain that it had also been responsible for
the outbreak of hysteria which had afflicted the citizens of the
Provencal town of Pont St. Esprit, not long before.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Pont St. Esprit outbreak was soon traced to ergot poisoning;
but the explanation of 'Mr. A's' disorder did not come until several
years later, when Dr. Johnson revealed in an autobiography that
he was 'Mr. A' himself (thus qualifying, perhaps, as the only
man to have been elected an M.P. after having been certified).
He was unable to show that cannabis had been responsible. By then,
however, the combination of the press campaign and the propaganda
of the Society for the Study of Addiction (whose Hon. Secretary's
views were given in the introduction to Johnson's book; distinguishing
between drunkards and cannabis users, he claimed that 'alcoholism,
for all its attendant degradation, does not usually poison one's
nature; drug addiction does') had led the Government to determine
to ban sales of the drug. As the medical profession disclaimed
any desire to use it, it ceased to be available even on prescription.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
What followed was a repetition of what had been happening in the
United States, though with the additional complication that the
police activity was initially directed against the West Indians.
A number of respectable citizens, who had taken cannabis all their
adult lives in much the same way as their white neighbours took
beer, found themselves given long prison sentences, coupled with
judicial homilies on their wickedness in corrupting British youth.
The effect the campaign had was greatly to increase the demand.
By driving it underground, the authorities succeeded in making
'pot' a secular cult, combining the attractions of a rebel conspiracy
against parental and civil authority, and a secret society. White
teenagers took to the drug in rapidly growing numbers, so that
by 1964 more whites than coloureds were being convicted of cannabisoffences.. Inevitably, the demand grew for tougher enforcement,
and higher penalties. But cabinet ministers or stockbrokers who
applauded the searches of a pop singer's suitcases by the Customs,
or his flat by the police, became less enthusiastic when they
found that most of the white malefactors were from the aristocracy
and the professional classes&#151;including their own sons and daughters.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This was an embarrassment, because by the Dangerous Drug Act of
1965, designed to implement United Nations' policy, penalties
had been raised. In theory, anybody found in possession of cannabis
could receive as long a sentence as a convicted murderer. In 1967
the Labour Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, sought a way out of the
difficulty by appointing a committee of enquiry into the whole
subject under Lady Wootton, the leading British authority in the
area where sociology, criminology and psychiatry overlap. Its
report, published in 1969, followed those of earlier enquiries.
There was nothing to suggest that cannabis was responsible for
aggressive social behaviour, or crime, or ill-health. Physically-speaking
it was 'very much less dangerous than the opiates, amphetamines,
and barbiturates, and also less dangerous than alcohol'. Nor was
there any evidence that cannabis-takers were led on to take heroin;
'it is the personality of the user, rather than the properties
of the drug, that is likely to cause progression to other drugs'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
James Callaghan, Jenkins' successor as Home Secretary, was no
more disposed than Nixon to accept the committee's verdict. He
excused himself from taking action by claiming&#151;as Nixon was
to do&#151;that the committee had allowed itself to be bamboozled
by the cannabis lobby. But whatever the disagreements on the committee's
findings there was no disputing one of its assertions; that in
spite of campaigns to stamp it out, cannabis use was on the increase.
Doubtless encouraged by the report, the users continued to multiply,
as an investigation undertaken by the <I>Sunday Telegraph,</I>
revealed in 1972. Previously, the cannabis had entered the country
chiefly in small consignments, often amateurishly brought in.
But the demand had now put up the price to the point where it
attracted a smuggling network of the sophisticated kind hitherto
associated with the heroin traffic:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ingenuity shown in disguising cannabis in freight is endless.
It has been found concealed in crates of foodstuff, the handles
of badminton racquets, padded ice-hockey gloves, sub-aqua air
bottles, surf boards, hippie beads, sculptured busts, contraceptives,
antiques, Moroccan pouffes and ornamental bricks.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Other expedients employed by the traffickers included the use
of radio-controlled model aircraft, launched from motor-boats
in the English Channel, and&#151;most serious of all&#151;of the diplomatic
bags addressed to members of the Embassies of the poorer countries,
who had learned how they could enjoy high living in London with
no trouble, and rarely any risk. A senior member of the staff
of the Indian High Commission had been detected, the <I>Sunday
Telegraph</I> report claimed, smuggling 50,000 grains of cannabis
into Britain in a consignment of chutney.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Faced with such evidence, the reaction of the Customs was to boast
that larger quantities of cannabis were being intercepted. But
this, as Timothy Green explained in his book about international
smuggling, must be regarded as the measure of prohibition's failure.
No large scale smuggling operation could afford to lose more than
a small proportion of its consignments&#151;around five per cent,
Green estimated. It followed that if more cannabis was being intercepted,
this could only mean that more was finding its way in. Only if
interceptions began to <I>fall,</I> should the Customs claim they
were succeeding. In much the same way, the rise in the number
of convictions, which the police used to justify themselves&#151;from
around fifty in 1957 to over 10,000 in 1972&#151;could more sensibly
be regarded as a reflection of a great increase in drug taking.
The estimates of the number of cannabis users supplied to the
Wootton Committee in 1968 had ranged between 30,000 and 300,000.
The <I>Sunday Telegraph's</I> investigators came to the conclusion
that in 1972 'although the United Kingdom is in general a law-abiding
country, anything up to two millions of its citizens use the drug'.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Heroin: U.S.A.</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
If the authorities in Britain and the United States could not
suppress the use of cannabis by banning it, the chances of the
traffic in heroin, easier and vastly more profitable to smuggle,
being effectively stopped by prohibition were remote. The British,
realising this, held on to their policy of allowing doctors to
prescribe a maintenance dose; and it worked&#151;though they had
some uneasy moments in the 1960s, when it was found that the number
of new cases of addiction, though negligible by American standards,
was rising with disconcerting rapidity. An investigation revealed
the reason; a handful of doctors were prescribing heroin so lavishly
that they were feeding the small black market in the drug. There
had always been the risk that leaving it up to the individual
doctor to decide who needed heroin might lead to trouble. The
biggest category of morphinists in the world, Lewin claimed, were
doctors; and there were ninety doctors among Britain's 300 known
heroin addicts in the early 1950s. There were also a few who were
concerned only to increase their incomes. Reluctantly, the medical
profession had to agree to abrogate its members traditional right,
and confine the prescribing of heroin to designated clinics. The
expedient worked; the rise in the addiction rate was halted.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Why, then, was the British system not introduced in the United
States ? Partly because it would have meant passing control to
the Department of Health and Welfare. It was Anslinger's boast
that he blocked this proposal, because he preferred to work in
liaison with the Coast Guard, the Customs, the Secret Service
and the Department of Justice. When it was pointed out to him
that control by the Department of Health in Britain had largely
made it unnecessary for the Coast Guard, the Customs, the Secret
Service and the Department of Justice to concern themselves with
the heroin traffic, he insinuated that the British must be hiding
the real addiction figures. Anyway, he added, Britain was a small
island, which made it easier to prevent smuggling.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This was an unfortunate choice of argument, because it revealed
why his policies had been foredoomed to failure&#151;the smuggling
of heroin into the United States could not be prevented. Neither
stricter enforcement nor severer penalties were reducing it. Any
standard textbook on drugs showed why. Many heroin takers acquired
'tolerance', needing larger amounts to enjoy the same effects.
The more they took, the more difficult it was to stop taking the
drug, because of the agonising nature of the withdrawal symptoms&#151;even
worse with heroin than with the other opiates: yawning, restlessness,
irritability, tremor, insomnia, depression, nausea, vomiting,
intestinal spasm, diarrhea, chilliness alternating with sweatiness,
gooseflesh, cramps, pains in the bones, muscle spasms. While undergoing
these tortures, the addict knew&#151;as a textbook listing them put
it&#151;that 'at any point in the course of withdrawal, the administration
of a suitable narcotic will completely and dramatically suppress
the symptoms'. To purchase this relief, he would pay any price,
and risk any penalty. As a result, heroin became a profitable
enough commodity for the traffickers to be able to afford to conduct
their smuggling operations on a highly organised and efficient
level.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The blackest irony</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
So, by a savage paradox, the more determined the campaign by the
United States Government to stamp out the drug traffic, the better
it suited the traffickers. By the late 1960s, it was possible
for a syndicate to offer $35 a kilo for raw opium&#151;enough to
ensure an abundant supply from impoverished peasants in Eastern
and Middle Eastern countries, and to encourage them to cultivate
land which had not been tilled before. The heroin manufactured
from that kilo could be sold for $20,000; sometimes considerably
more. Out of so spectacular a profit rate, the syndicate were
able to afford to perfect their chain of operations so that at
each stage, the carriers of the heroin could not betray the man
who had consigned it to them, because they would not know who
he was: nor could they be betrayed by the man they handed it over
too, except through carelessness or bad management (a technique
which Timothy Green likened in his study of smuggling to a system
of electrical fuses so arranged that if one blew it could be replaced,
and the rest could continue to function normally). The larger
the difference between cost price and selling price, too, the
better the syndicates were able to afford to bribe Customs Officers
and policemen, and the greater the incentive for the 'pusher'
to extend his market by attracting new customers. And they were
thrown into his path by the Vietnam war, which introduced tens
of thousands of G.I.s to heroin. In Vietnam they could buy the
pure product at one-twentieth of its cost back home, where it
was often heavily adulterated. What happened&#151;as described by
Frances Fitzgerald in her <I>Fire in the Lake</I>&#151;reads like
mimicry of what had happened to so many earlier efforts at prohibition.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The traffic in heroin was the final and perhaps the blackest irony
of the war. The heroin came largely from Burma and Laos. Much
of it was processed in or near Vientiane by those people for whose
sake (it was to be supposed) the U.S. Government was demolishing
the rest of Laos. It came to Vietnam either by air drop from Vietnamese
or Lao military planes, paid for by the U.S. Government, or through
the Customs at Tan Son Hut airfield. The Vietnamese Customs Inspectors
earned several dozen times as much for not inspecting the bags
and bundles as for inspecting them. When the American Customs
advisers attempted to crack down on their 'counterparts', they
discovered that the two key customs posts were held by the brothers
of Thieu's Premier ... As this 'freely elected Government' would
not prosecute the Customs Officials (heroin, the Vietnamese said,
was 'an American problem'), the heroin continued to enter the
country unimpeded. Once in Vietnam it was sold openly in the streets
and around the American bases by young war widows and children
orphaned by the American War.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The United States might leave Vietnam&#151;Frances Fitzgerald remarked&#151;but
the Vietnam war would never leave the United States; 'the soldiers
would bring it back with them like an addiction'. They did. The
demand for heroin continued to rise until, as Frederick Forsyth
unkindly noted in a survey of the heroin traffic in 1973, it became
'America's largest single consumer import', worth $4,000,000,000
a year.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The fact that the prohibition policy led to an increase in drug-taking,
though, was less demoralising than its social side-effects; particularly
crimes of violence. This was not because drugs unleashed criminal
tendencies, as Anslinger had claimed; the criminal activity was
largely the result not of the drugs, but of the prohibition policy.
As the Le Dain Committee of enquiry into drug use in Canada put
it, in their interim report,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Because of the illegal nature of the drug the cost of a heavy
heroin habit may run anywhere from $ 15.00 to $50.00 a day and
higher, in spite of the fact that the medical cost of the drugs
involved would be just a few cents. There are very few legitimate
ways in which most individuals can afford to meet that kind of
expense. Consequently, when tolerance pushes the cost of drug
use above what the user can afford legitimately, he is forced
into a decision&#151;either to quit the drug and go through withdrawal,
or turn to easier, criminal, methods of acquiring the necessary
money.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In 1972 the New York Health Department estimated that there were
around 400,000 heroin addicts in the city; 15,000 of them in jails,
25,000 under treatment, the rest on the streets&#151;where, according
to the police commissioner Patrick Murphy, they were connected
with seventy per cent of the city's crimes. In Washington that
year, the city's Narcotics Treatment Organisation put the count
of heroin addicts at 15,000; its head, Dr. Robert du Pont, estimated
that 'the annual value of property and services transferred because
of addiction, through robbery, theft, prostitution, drug sales
and so on, was $328,000,000.' And at the same time, prohibition
was creating new criminals out of men and women who would not
ordinarily have become law breakers&#151;as the Le Dain Committee
noted in its final report in 1973. The fact of a drug being unobtainable
legally 'will often drive a person to seek support and reinforcement
in a deviant or criminal sub-culture'; and a prison sentence tended
to reinforce this bond, because there was 'a considerable circulation
of drugs within penal institutions'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
With heroin, as with marihuana, enforcement officials were ready
with what appeared to be evidence that they were doing their job&#151;figures
showing that they were improving the interception rate. The U.N.
narcotics committee were told that seizures of heroin in the United
States were up from 160 kg in 1969, to 221 kg in 1970. But in
the same period, the United States narcotic authorities' own estimates
for the illicit import of heroin, assuming they were correct,
showed that the proportion which was being seized had actually
fallen. And there was sufficient evidence of the involvement of
Customs and police by 1966 to lead John M. Murtagh, a judge of
the New York Criminal Court, to comment that the narcotics law
'corrupts more than it corrects'; a warning borne out three years
later when, within twelve months, no fewer than thirty-nine New
York narcotics agents who were under investigation for drug offences
resigned,
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Control at source</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Although the attempt to stop drugs coming into the United States
was not succeeding, there were hopes for a time that it might
be possible to introduce an alternative method of control. In
1959 an American fact-finding mission was despatched to visit
the countries of the Near East to investigate the drug traffic.
It reported that the chief source of illicit heroin were the Turkish
poppy fields. The opium was being smuggled through the Lebanon
to Italy and France, where it was converted into heroin and exported
to the United States. There was little prospect of interception,
as the people involved were untouchables; the Mafia, in Italy,
and unknown but evidently influential figures in France. But why
wait until the opium was on its way? Why not cut off the supply
at its sources?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The idea had the attraction of simplicity. The United States Government
was paying huge sums annually in a futile effort to beat the smugglers;
part of the expenditure could be diverted, in the form of aid,
to induce the Governments of the countries where the poppy&#151;or
any other drug-producing plant&#151;was cultivated, to prevent cultivators
from growing crops to supply the illicit market. The problem would
then solve itself, for there would be no raw material for the
traffickers to work on. All that was needed was some new international
agreement, of the kind that had been mooted in the old League
days, but which the U.N. should be better able to enforce. Anslinger
had himself appointed as the United States delegate to the U.N.
Commission to promote the policy, and in 1961 agreement was reached
on what became known as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It proved to be as unworkable as the Hague and Geneva conventions,
and for the same reasons; chief among them, the fact that some
of the nations involved had promised more than they could perform,
and others had never any intention of implementing their pledges.
Typical of the unreality was the Convention's decision that 'the
use of cannabis (hemp) for other than medical and scientific purposes
must be discontinued as soon as possible, but in any case within
twenty-five years'; a 'rather optimistic time-table', as Dr. Norman
Taylor&#151;Curator of the New York Botanical Gardens, and author
of a couple of refreshingly sane books on drugs&#151;remarked, when
'matched against three thousand years of use by untold millions'.
Taylor's scepticism was justified. Visiting Morocco eleven years
later, a Guardian correspondent found that though the Government
had pledged its support to the campaign to phase out <I>kif,</I>
it had carefully refrained from interfering with the cultivation
of hemp. The farmers were earning twice as much from it as they
had earned from growing corn; so, as a tribesman explained, 'now
we've all switched'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The attempt to deprive the heroin traffickers of their main source,
the poppy fields of Turkey, also failed. Tempted by the promise
of American aid, the Turkish Government agreed to try to stop
poppy cultivation for the black market; and for a while the production
of opium was restricted. But as the illicit marketeers were able
to offer higher prices, this only meant that it was the supply
of legitimate&#151;medical&#151;opium which dwindled. By 1972 some nations
were running short; the Japanese representative complained at
the U.N. that his country could only get half its legitimate requirements.
At the same time the Turkish peasants, who had been instructed
to stop growing poppies, were becoming restive. The payments they
had received out of the American funds, they felt, were insufficient
to compensate them for the loss of so lucrative a crop. As their
votes were at stake, the Turkish Minister for Agriculture in the
Ecevit Government began, in 1974, to dismantle the controls his
predecessors had introduced.

<H2>The Collapse of Control</H2></CENTER>
<HR>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
EVEN IF HEROIN AND CANNABIS COULD HAVE BEEN BANISHED, it had become
clear by the 1970s that they would immediately have been replaced
by other drugs. Some had already established themselves&#151;occasionally
with the active help of governments, or of the medical profession,
or both.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
When the amphetamines&#151;'pep pills'&#151;were first marketed in the
1930s, doctors had begun to prescribe them for patients who felt
tired or lethargic; and later as a slimming aid. During the war
they proved a help to men in the forces who were required to stay
alert on duty; and when it ended, vast quantities of them, surplus
to requirements, were dumped on the open market. Sometimes they
were employed as an adjunct to alcohol; when in 1947 'Chips' Channon
held the dinner party which one of his guests, Somerset Maugham,
told him was the apogee of his career (the guests included two
queens), he described in his diary how he had 'laced' the cocktails
with benzedrine, 'which I find always makes a party go'. But then
it was realised that, injected intravenously, the amphetamines
could produce an explosive bout of euphoria; and as they were
cheap and easily available, they were soon being extensively used
for that purpose, with destructive effects on the health of some
of the addicts, ranging from brittle finger-nails to ulcers, chest
infections, liver disorders, and cerebral haemorrhages. Governments
banned sales, except on prescription; but so many people had acquired
the habit of taking the drug, and so many doctors were willing
to indulge them, that the black market was rarely short of supplies.
Taking amphetamines, in Brecher's estimation, ranked 'among the
most disastrous forms of drug use yet devised'&#151;particularly
in Sweden, where the attempt to impose total prohibition led only
to a rise in the price, encouraging illicit manufacture and smuggling,
and leading to a spectacular growth in the number of addicts.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Barbiturates took a similar course. In 1949 <I>Colliers</I> ran
an article under the title 'Thrill pills can ruin you', alerting
its readers to the fact that sleeping pills, if injected, were
euphoric. The health authorities added their warnings which, as
Brecher commented, ensured that 'throughout the 1950s and the
1960s, the relatively harmless sleeping tablets of the 1930s played
their new role as one of the major illicit American drugs'. As
with the amphetamines, the barbiturates were so widely prescribed
that control was impossible; the black market could be fed from
tens of thousands of family medicine cupboards. But when a committee
of enquiry set up by the British Government recommended in 1972
that the barbiturates should be re-categorised, to bring them
under the same type of control as heroin, the British Medical
Association's scientific committee successfully blocked the proposal,
ostensibly because of the 'practical difficulties in implementing
regulations', but really because it would further have eroded
the doctor's right to prescribe.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Cocaine also made a come-back 'Sniffing' had enjoyed a vogue in
the United States in the 1920s; in his <I>Drugs and the Mind,</I>
Robert S. de Ropp surmised that the original 'dope fiend' peddled
cocaine, rather than heroin. But it was expensive; the amphetamines,
far cheaper and more easily obtainable, for a while replaced it.
When the amphetamines proved an unsatisfactory substitute, cocaine
began to return to favour in American cities. Its high price was
less of an impediment to sales than it had been in the depressed
1930s, and provided an incentive to smugglers; Timothy Green estimated
in 1969 that a yachtsman carrying 10 lb. of cocaine to the United
States could make &#163;10,000 on a single trip; and by 1973,
according to Thomas Plate in the <I>New York</I> magazine, 10
lb. was fetching anything up to $ 160,000 on the market. With
the raw materials, coca leaves, abundant and cheap, this left
an ample margin to perfect smuggling techniques, and to bribe
Customs or police. Once the cocaine had been brought in, there
was no difficulty in selling it. What Plate called the iron law
of drug marketing, 'supply determines demand', came into operation;
whenever it was available, cocaine became
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... the drug of choice, not only among whites but ever increasingly
among affluent black drug users as well . . . Among Latin Americans
in New York, cocaine is often the preferred drug of entertainers,
expensive prostitutes, very successful businessmen, and certain
religious sects for whom cocaine use is literally an act of faith.
And among white drug users, cocaine is especially popular with
rock stars, writers, younger actors and actresses, and stockbrokers
and other Wall Street types ...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
And even if all these drugs could have been brought under some
control&#151;by, say, the discovery of some instrument on the lines
of a Geiger counter, capable of infallibly detecting them&#151;it
would not have solved the problem. Apart from synthetic variants,
there were numerous substances which though not sold as drugs,
could be used for that purpose&#151;and frequently were. Benzine
and glue had long been sniffed 'for kicks', and with the advent
of the aerosol can, it was found that there were endless alternatives;
'literally hundreds of easily accessible sources', the Le Dain
Committee found, including paints, paint removers, lighter fuel,
and dry-cleaning fluids: 'it was recently observed that thirty-eight
different products containing such substances were available from
the shelves of a service station's highway store in Ottawa'. In
the circumstances, the Committee pointed out, effective restriction
was hardly practicable, 'except at considerable inconvenience
to a large segment of the population'; and, as the large segment
of the population was unlikely to accept that inconvenience, the
existence of these 'substances' created a problem 'which clearly
calls into question the potential of the crimino-legal system
in controlling drug use'.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The doors of perception</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The crimino-legal system of control, whatever its defects, was
at least theoretically relevant so long as there was agreement
that drug-taking was a social evil, which ought to be suppressed.
But by this time a different category of drug had come into widespread
use, supported by testimonials from men whose opinions commanded
respect, who claimed that it could bring great benefit to society.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
During the war a Basle chemist, Dr. Albert Hofmann, took a minute
quantity of an ergot derivative&#151;four-millionths of a gramme&#151;in
his laboratory, and after cycling home with some difficulty ('my
field of vision swayed before me and was distorted like the reflections
in an amusement park mirror, I had the impression of being unable
to move from the spot, although my assistants later told me that
we had cycled at a good pace') he experienced startling symptoms,
which he noted down when he recovered;
<BLOCKQUOTE>
vertigo, visual disturbances&#151;the faces of those around me appeared
as grotesque, coloured masks; marked motor unrest, alternating
with paralysis; an intermittent feeling in the head, limbs, and
the entire body, as if they were filled with lead: dry, constricted
sensation in the throat; feeling of choking; clear recognition
of my condition, in which I sometimes observed, in the manner
of an independent, neutral observer, that I shouted half insanely
or babbled incoherent words. Occasionally I felt as if I were
out of my body . . .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
By that time&#151;1943&#151;there was more of a disposition to investigate
any drug capable of inducing such a reaction&#151;not out of any
feeling that the visions might be of value to the beholder, but
because the Pentagon was looking for a drug which might be used
to facilitate brainwashing, or for disorienting enemy forces in
the field. And as the visions which Hofmann's LSD induced sometimes
bore a resemblance to those seen in psychotic states, a few psychiatrists
began experimenting with it in the hope it might help in the treatment
of schizophrenia. Although the military soon lost interest, and
the psychiatrists' hopes were not realised, LSD was remembered
when there was a sudden resurgence of interest in vision-inducing
drugs, following the publication of Aldous Huxley's <I>The Doors
of Perception</I> in 1954.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There was nothing strikingly new in Huxley's experience after
taking mescaline. His description of looking at his bookshelves&#151;
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Red books, like rubies; emerald books; books bound in white jade;
books of agate, or aquamarine, of yellow topaz; lapis lazuli books
whose colours were so intense, so intrinsically meaningful, that
they seemed to be on the point of leaving the shelves to thrust
themselves more insistently on my attention
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
&#151;might have come from Havelock Ellis, or from the case histories
provided earlier by Louis Lewin. But the general public, disillusioned
with civilisation's materialist progress, was more willing by
the 1950s to listen to Huxley's argument that the heightened or
altered perception obtainable from mescaline was worth enjoying,
not just in its own right, but for the new insights, the new meanings,
it could provide. 'I am not so foolish', he wrote
<BLOCKQUOTE>
as to equate what happens under the influence of mescaline or
of any other drug, prepared or in the future preparable, with
the realisation of the end and ultimate purpose of human life;
Enlightenment, the Beatific Vision. All I am suggesting is that
the mescaline experience is what Catholic theologians call 'a
gratuitous grace', not necessary to salvation but potentially
helpful and to be accepted thankfully, if made available. To be
shaken out of the ruts of ordinary perception, to be shown for
a few timeless hours the outer and the inner world, not as they
appear to an animal obsessed with survival or to a human being
obsessed with words and notions, but as they are apprehended,
directly and unconditionally, by Mind at Large&#151;this is an experience
of inestimable value to everyone and especially to the intellectual.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
People who wanted to shake themselves out of the ruts of ordinary
perception did not find it easy to obtain mescaline, for which
the raw material peyote was scarce; but LSD could be manufactured
in a laboratory, and it quickly became the standard drug for that
purpose. And scientific trials began to confirm&#151;in so far as
such trials could&#151;that it worked. In LSD&#151;Dr. Richard Blum
and his associates at Stanford University claimed in 1964&#151;a
means had been found 'for enhancing values or expanding the self,
a road to love and better relationships, a device for art appreciation
or a spur to creative endeavors, a means of insight, and a door
to religious experience'. For a few individuals, though, researchers
admitted, the consequence of taking LSD was a 'bad trip', involving
experiences which were disturbing and sometimes terrifying. Stories
began to circulate about the destructive effect of these bad trips
on promising youths, like those which had been heard about marihuana
(or tobacco), but with some characteristic twists&#151;in particular,
the much-repeated tale of the girl who told her friends 'look,
I can fly!' and stepped to her death from a fourth-floor window.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Inevitably, down came the ban&#151;even, in the United States, on
research into LSD. The outcome was the growth of a cult, catered
for through a profitable black market. The formula was generally
known; the materials available; the manufacturing process not
difficult; and distribution ridiculously simple, as LSD, in addition
to being tasteless, odourless and colourless, occupied negligible
space in relation to its potency. Prohibition was immediately
followed, Brecher wrote,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(a) by an increase in the availability of LSD, and (b) by an increase
in the demand. The increased availability can be explained in
part by the higher prices which law enforcement engendered, and
which attracted more distributors. The increased demand can similarly
be explained in part by the LSD publicity that legislative action
engendered. As in the case of the opiates, the barbiturates, the
amphetamines, glue and other drugs, the warnings functioned as
lures.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The peyote cult</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It is possible from the available evidence to show how the attempt
to suppress the vision-inducing drugs has failed, and why: because
it has repeated the self-defeating pattern so often seen before.
What is not yet possible is to assess the impact of the mescaline/LSD
movement (or even, for that matter, of the influence of the cannabis
cult) on those who came to take it, let alone on society as a
whole.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Early on, the psychedelic movement split into two main groupings,
though they were never clearly differentiated. Both derived from
the views of Humphrey Osmond&#151;who had introduced Huxley to mescaline:
that these drugs 'provide a chance, perhaps only a slender one,
for <I>homo faber,</I> the cunning, ruthless, foolhardy pleasure-greedy
toolmaker, to merge into that other creature whose presence we
have so rashly presumed, <I>homo sapiens</I> the wise, the understanding,
the compassionate'. By some of Osmond's followers, this was taken
to mean that the function of the drugs was simply to reveal, to
anybody who took them, the limitations he had been imposing on
himself; so that he would seek ways, not necessarily through drugs,
to explore the potential within himself which he had not known
existed. But there were others who, like Dr. Timothy Leary, tended
to invest the drugs themselves with almost magical powers, and
to propagandise for them on a national&#151;and eventually, on an
international&#151;scale. By the 1970s the Leary version was beginning
to go out of fashion; LSD was being used, if not with more discrimination&#151;its
illegality made this difficult&#151;at least with greater care, in
recognition of the unpredictability of its effects. But the story
of the movement which Huxley and Osmond sparked off, and which
in their different ways William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg and
Carlos Casteneda, among others, pushed along, cannot yet adequately
be told&#151;not, at least, as history.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
What can be told is the parallel story of how differently peyotl
was handled in the Indian reservations; and how different the
results. A century ago it was found that the peyotl cult had not,
as had for many years been believed, been successfully put down
by the Spaniards. After they were driven from Mexico, it began
to re-emerge. The peyotl cactus, anthropologists found, was still
worshipped, though the ceremonial had picked up Christian accretions,
originally designed to deceive the Spaniards, but eventually establishing
themselves in their own right, so that the ceremony took the general
form of the Mass, and Jesus's name was involved. Peyotl was still
taken, though, for the traditional vision-inducing purposes, as
were the morning glory, and the psilocybe mushroom; the Mazatecs
believed that Jesus had given the mushroom to them, and included
him and his saints' names in their chants.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In the 1880s the peyotl cult began to spread north into the United
States, alarming members of the Commission on Indian Affairs.
The Commission's agent in charge of the Comanche reported in 1886
that they were getting a kind of cactus from Mexico 'which they
eat, and it produces the same effect as opium, frequently putting
them to sleep for twenty-four hours at a time'; he forwarded some
specimens for analysis, adding that 'as the habit of using them
seems to be growing among them, and is evidently injurious, I
would respectfully suggest that the same be made contraband'.
The Federal Government did not take his advice; but from time
to time individual State legislatures, disturbed by reports that
Indians in their reservations were going over to peyotism, would
debate how to stop them getting supplies of the drug. The difficulty
ordinarily was that peyotism was a religion and that it had wrapped
itself up in enough Christian doctrine to be able to liken peyotl
to communion wine. How far this was originally deliberate policy
is hard to tell; but it became so with the foundation of the Native
American Church, whose expressed aims were
<BLOCKQUOTE>
to foster and promote religious beliefs in Almighty God and the
customs of the several tribes of Indians throughout the united
States in the worship of a heavenly Father, and to promote morality,
sobriety, industry, charity and right living and cultivate a spirit
of self-respect, brotherly love and union among the members of
the several tribes of Indians throughout the united States and
through the sacramental use of peyote
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But to many Christians, the use of peyotl was not so much sacramental
as sacrilegious; and to many respectable citizens, it was scandalous
that the American Indians should be permitted to enjoy a notorious
drug. A campaign after the Second World War to have it banned
was only warded off with difficulty, largely through the efforts
of two anthropologists who had studied the subject, Weston La
Barre and J. S. Slotkin. It was amazing, Slotkin observed, to
find that the expert evidence on which the campaigners relied&#151;fantastic
stories about the effects of the drug, and the nature of the ritual&#151;was
derived from white and Catholic officials in the reservations;
'none of them have had the slightest first-hand experience with
the plant or with the religion, yet some fancy themselves to be
authorities and write Official reports on the subject.' From his
own extensive experience, members of the cult were both more industrious
and more temperate in their drinking habits than other Indians
in the reservation.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
With the renewal of interest in vision-inducing drugs in the 1950s,
the campaign against peyotl started up again, this time for fear
of what it might do to the white youth of America. In 1964 a California
court ruled that it was a sufficient public danger to justify
a ban on it, in violation of religious freedom, because it was
gaining adherents among the hippies; and the rumour circulated
that it was frequently the cause of insanity. Newspapers began
printing some of the same kind of stories that had circulated
about hemp drugs in India. An investigation was set up by Dr.
Robert L. Bergman, of the Public Health Services, to follow up
the fifty-odd reports of peyotl-induced psychosis. The vast majority
of the reports, it was found, were simply hearsay, and could not
be traced to any source. Only one single instance was found which
could be described as 'a relatively clear-cut case of acute psychosis',
and that was of a Navajo who, in defiance of the cult's own injunction,
had also consumed a quantity of alcohol. Although the cult did
not always 'take'&#151;the Apaches on their Reservations adopted
it for a while, but went back to alcohol, their preferred drug&#151;in
general its effects appeared beneficial. 'We have seen many people
come through difficult crises with the help of this religion',
Dr. Bergman commented,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
and it appears to me that for many Indian people threatened with
identity-diffusion it provides real help in seeing themselves
not as people whose place and way in the world is gone but as
people whose way can be strong enough to change and meet new challenges.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The success of the cult, admittedly, does not prove that it would
have been possible to establish anything similar among the white
population of America, or of other Western countries. Nor would
the obvious alternative&#151;making LSD a prescription drug, to be
dealt with by doctors&#151;have worked; few doctors have the required
interest or understanding. What the peyotl experience does suggest
is that alternatives could have been found to the drug policies
of Western governments, had there been a better appreciation of
what was involved.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Mao's way</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In retrospect, then, the lesson which emerges from the confused
history of drugs is that though we have been unable to learn the
right way to handle them, we have at least been shown what is
the wrong way: prohibition. But there has been one striking exception
to this rule: Communist China. It seems to be agreed, even by
observers who have little sympathy with the rule of Chairman Mao,
that opium has effectively been banished.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Three forces were at work to make this possible. Public opinion
in China remained hostile to opium, as a foreign imposition. In
so highly communalised a country, it was difficult for those who
smoked opium to do so for long without being detected, and denounced;
and even harder for farmers to cultivate poppies. Most important
of all, smuggling became unprofitable because the ordinary commercial
channels through which opium could be illicitly distributed ceased
to exist.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In Western countries, though public opinion might be hostile to
drugs, there was always sufficient privacy available to enable
those who were able to obtain them to take them with relatively
little risk; the commercial channels were geared to assist the
smuggler, as was the freedom of movement between country and country;
and there was far more purchasing power available to be spent
on drugs. China s example, consequently, was irrelevant, and would
remain so as long as the Western countries retained their traditional
economic and social fabric.

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
ENDLESSLY, OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE ISSUE HAS BEEN DEBATED;
should cannabis, or mescaline, or LSD, be legalised ? The record
of history suggests that the question should be put the other
way round: should such drugs be banned ? For then, the answer
can be given unequivocally: no. Prohibition has always failed
in free enterprise societies&#151;free, that is, to the extent that
consumers who have the means can exercise freedom of choice. If
they choose drugs, no law can stop them. Prohibition may restrict
supplies, for a time, but that will only drive up prices, bringing
in fresh supplies&#151;or different drugs. And this flouting of the
law breeds disrespect for it, alienates otherwise law-abiding
citizens, and corrupts the law enforcers.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The question needs to be re-phrased: not, shall we legalise? but,
how shall we legalise? And to this, unfortunately, history gives
no satisfactory answer. It is easy to say, as drugs cannot be
suppressed, they should be regulated; but at this point the same
difficulty arises as with prostitution. The kind of man to whom
drugs, or prostitutes, are anathema, whether he be an Anslinger
or a Muggeridge, finds the prospect of regulating them distasteful.
It implies recognition, and they do not want what they regard
as a vice to be recognised. They consequently cling to the illusion
that drugs can be suppressed, if only the law is enforced.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This leads to a further error of policy. Unwilling to accept the
existence of a distinction between, say, cannabis and heroin,
they justify banning both, by claiming 'soft drugs lead on to
hard'. They sometimes do; but not nearly so inexorably as the
<I>prohibition</I> of soft drugs leads on to hard. The reason
is obvious; hard drugs are both easier and far more profitable
to smuggle. The most striking example is what happened in Hong
Kong when opium smoking, which had been tolerated for a century,
and had never given the authorities any worry (the rate of addiction
to opium among the Chinese, reports often pointed out, was far
less serious than the rate of alcoholism among the Europeans on
the island) was banned. After the ban, opium was squeezed out
of the market by heroin; and by the 1970s, according to the Commissioner
of Police, four-fifths of the men in the island's penal institutions
had been involved in drug offenses.. Much the same happened in
Vietnam, according to the investigator sent by the Pentagon to
examine the drug situation there. The only beneficiaries from
a campaign against marihuana, he reported, had been the heroin
pushers.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But governments have ignored the evidence that prohibition cannot
work. And this is not surprising, as they have a powerful financial
interest in maintaining a situation in which certain suppliers
are allowed to keep their hold over the legal drug market, in
return for their massive contribution to the revenue. Legalising
cannabis, admittedly, might have augmented the revenue; but there
was always the risk that it would provide a diversion, reducing
the quantity of liquor and tobacco sold. It is never wise to attribute
calculation, in such matters, to ministers. Individually, perhaps,
none of them may realise how the policies they have followed have
come to be formulated. But revenue has tended to be the overriding
consideration; and anything which has threatened it has been discouraged.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This has been illustrated recently in the elaborate efforts which
governments have made to appear to be campaigning against cigarettes,
as a danger to health, while in fact making very certain that
their campaign will not, and cannot, succeed. Governments, in
fact, are the real drug-pushers of our time. They seem to know&#151;by
the instinct of financial self-preservation&#151;that the 'safe'
drugs from their point of view are those on which users come to
depend, socially as well as psychologically&#151;drink and cigarettes;
and they cling to the two of them, in spite of the ugly evidence
that has been building up against them. Cannabis and LSD, which
do not exert the same hold, would not serve the exchequer nearly
as well.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
State licensing, therefore, though less disastrous in its consequences
than prohibition, is an unsatisfactory method. It controls drugs,
but to ensure their profitability rather than their safety. And
even where a measure of safety is sought by handing over responsibility
to the medical profession, the results (though again, better than
prohibition) have been discouraging. There is little in a medical
student's training to qualify him to dispense drugs wisely, and,
as the medical journals frequently complain, the lavish prescribing
of drugs in recent years suggests that doctors are often more
concerned to save themselves time and trouble, than to find the
cause of the patient's disorder. Just as governments are the pimps
of the tobacco and liquor interests, so the medical profession
has allowed itself to become a licensed drug-peddler for the pharmaceutical
industry.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There is little to be hoped from State intervention, therefore,
until the electorate begins to grasp the lessons of the past.
But as Hegel once complained, what experience and history teach
is that 'peoples and governments never have learnt anything from
history, or acted on principles derived from it'. And in the case
of drugs, there is an additional reason why the lessons have not
been learned; the existence of a deep irrational fear of them,
which leaves otherwise sensible and intelligent members of the
community unwilling to accept that there can be a case for legalisation,
let alone to listen to it&#151;even when the objective is the reduction
of drug taking.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Such people will not accept the realities of the situation&#151;for
example, that alcohol is a drug, and a much more dangerous one
than most of those which are banned. On the other hand, they will
swallow the corniest fantasies about other drugs. They believe
that heroin, say, has a built-in addictive attraction, so that
anybody taking it once can be enslaved for life. Yet this was
exploded years ago by Louis Lasagna, researching into addiction
in America: most people given heroin for the first time, he found
(other than for the relief of pain), were either not interested,
or actually disliked the experience. As the Le Dain Committee
put it, 'the once popular notion that opiate narcotic experience
is intrinsically pleasurable, or that physiological dependence
develops so rapidly that most who are subjected to it are promptly
addicted, is without support'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Then, there is the persistent myth that drugs can turn the ordinary
citizen into a maniac. It is as old as Marco Polo's tale of the
Old Man of the Mountain; it has been told of almost every drug;
and it still crops up. In 1940 the rumour spread&#151;Evelyn Waugh
recalled it in <I>Put Out More Flags</I>&#151;that the German infantry
then sweeping across France was composed of teenagers, drugged
before battle to make them oblivious of danger, so that they advanced
unhesitatingly even when being mown down by allied machine-gun
fire. It later transpired that these drugs were amphetamines,
issued in case the soldiers needed to stay awake. A quarter of
a century later American troops in Vietnam brought back pills
found on allegedly drug-crazed Vietcong, who had been wiped out
in an insanely reckless attack. On analysis the pills turned out
to be antibiotics, sent to Saigon at the expense of the American
taxpayer, and then discreetly diverted by the minister who received
them to the enemy, for the usual consideration.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This is not to dispute that a drug&#151;any drug&#151;may precipitate
a character change; the gentle, quiet man who gets aggressive
when drunk is all too familiar a figure to publicans. But the
disorder lies in the individual, or in his life pattern; not in
the drug. Most of the troubles which have arisen are due to society's
failure to make this distinction. Yet a last line of argument
in favour of the <I>status quo</I> remains. Drugs may not be the
cause&#151;any more than cars are the cause of road accidents; but
in irresponsible hands drugs, like cars, can be lethal. Does this
not require intervention, by the State or some duly authorised
body, for society's protection ?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Looked at from this point of view, drugs have three main dangers.
Unquestionably the most serious is intoxication. In the long term,
though man has an astonishing capacity to survive his chosen poisons,
certain drugs can be shown to have deleterious consequences, on
the evidence of mortality statistics; and in the short term, people
under their influence&#151;whether at the wheel of a car, or at the
heel of a drunken argument&#151;can be very destructive. But as the
intoxicant which has the worst long-term health record is tobacco,
and the one with the worst short-term accident record is alcohol,
this represents an argument for stricter control of established
drugs, rather than of those which are illegal.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The risk of addiction&#151;the second reason commonly given when
a repressive drug policy is being defended&#151;has now been shown
to be less a drug problem, in the strict sense, than a psychological
disorder. Unless drugs of all kinds, including nutmeg and paint
remover, could be removed from the market, there is little point
in hoping that it can be dealt with by legislation.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It is the third common consequence of drug-taking which presents
the real challenge; the personality change which some people undergo
as a result of introduction to cannabis or LSD. Their record in
other respects is much better than alcohol and tobacco. They do
not intoxicate, unless taken in improbably large doses; they are
not addictive; and their adverse effects on health, so far as
can be judged on the evidence available, are relatively insignificant.
But they confront society with an issue that it has been unwilling
to face. People may need these drugs; not in their own right,
but as a preliminary to restoration of the link, largely lost,
between man's consciousness, and all that lies beyond it. The
personality change may be for their benefit.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The positive values people find in the drug experience&#151;as the
Le Dain Committee put it&#151;'bear a striking similarity to traditional
religious values, including the concern with the soul, or inner
self. The spirit of renunciation, the emphasis on openness and
the closely-knit community, are part of it, but there is definitely
a sense of identification with something larger, something to
which one belongs as part of the human race.' This theme was taken
up by Andrew Weil in his <I>The Natural Mind.</I> Weil argued
that to think of drug-taking, or even of drug-addiction, as something
to be prevented or cured is a mistake. The sensation, and the
craving, are symptoms of a psychic need. He produced evidence
which indicates that there is no great difficulty in getting people
off even heroin, provided they have, as it were, something to
look forward to&#151;which suggests that withdrawal symptoms may
represent not simply the body's resistance to being deprived of
a drug, but the mind's resistance to being deprived of its effects.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To Weil, however, this does not entail believing that cannabis,
say, should be legalised. On the contrary, in his testimony to
the Shafer Commission he opposed it, on the ground that it would
be used in ways as unintelligent as tobacco and alcohol ordinarily
are. The drug scene cannot be changed by tinkering with the law,
he argued, because it is 'a manifestation of useless ways of thinking
at all levels of society&#151;among users of drugs as well as of
non-users'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Drug use, and drug abuse, are a reflection of society, its tensions,
its values, and its needs. To punish drug-takers is like a drunk
striking the bleary face which he sees in the mirror. Drugs will
not be brought under control until society itself changes, enabling
men to use them with discrimination, and perhaps in time to dispense
with them.

<H2>Acknowledgements</H2>
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
ANYBODY KNOWN TO BE WRITING ABOUT DRUGS CAN COUNT UPON getting
countless ideas and suggestions and occasionally a valuable lead
towards books or authors he has never heard of. I have been very
lucky, in this respect; finding myself more than once in possession
of a scrap of paper with some reference on it, and remembering
only that I had received it from some chance acquaintance at a
party. To all those who have helped me in this way, my thanks;
and especially to Frances Fitzgerald, Dr. Griffith Edwards, Professor
Max Gluckman, Professor Bernard Lewis, Dr. Jonathan Miller, Dr.
Neal E. Miller, Professor Michael Shepherd, Dr. Gerry Stimson,
Frances Verrinder, R. G. Wasson, and Lyall Watson. Francis Huxley
made some suggestions about the section on drugs in primitive
societies which I was glad to incorporate; Raye Farr, and Bill
Grundy read a preliminary draft (I hope I have profited from their
astringent comments) and, along with Bernard Levin (I wish I could
have included some of his asides) somehow also found the time
to do the invaluable chore of proof-reading. I am also grateful
to Jasper Woodcock and his team at the Institute for the Study
of Drug Dependence; but my chief debt is to the London Library,
for the help from its staff, and for the access to its shelves,
where I could browse at random in the&#151;to me&#151;often unfamiliar
territory into which the research so often lured me.<P>&nbsp;  
<H2>Sources</H2>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
IN HIS BOOK ON COCA, PUBLISHED IN 1901, W. G. MORTIMER WAS able
to boast that he had collected 600 titles of articles and books
on that drug alone. The bibliography compiled a few years ago
by the U.N. Economic and Social Committee on Narcotic Drugs listed
nearly 2,000 sources of material on cannabis. In its interim report
on drugs in Canada, the Le Dain Committee stated that there were
already some 3,000 reports on LSD in scientific journals. When
Joseph Robert wrote his history of tobacco, in 1949, the standard
research guide contained over 6,000 titles; when he came to revise
the book in 1967, he found that the guide, which was also being
revised, was expected to include a further 4,000 titles. Nobody,
so far as I know, has tried to keep count of the works on opium
and its derivatives, but they would certainly reach five figures.
As for alcohol, the library at Rutgers University, which specialises
in the subject, is reputed to contain 40,000 items.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The writer of any work purporting to be a history is ordinarily
anxious that his bibliography should display the extent and depth
of his research; in admitting that mine has been far from comprehensive,
I can only plead these figures in mitigation. And there has been
another difficulty. As my concern had been mainly with the social
rather than the pharmacological effects of drugs, several academic
disciplines have been involved. Information about attitudes to
drugs can be found not only in many social histories, but in works
on anthropology, ethnology, mythology, theology, phenomenology,
ecology, etymology and archeology, as well as in the descriptions
of travellers, explorers and botanists. It has consequently been
an enormous advantage when some professional&#151;or an inspired
amateur, like R. G. Wasson&#151;has already researched some part
of the territory, and published his findings; but such ventures
have been regrettably few.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There are also some gaps, which cannot be filled until more&#151;or
more reliable&#151;information becomes available; drug use behind
the Iron Curtain, for example. So the structure of the book, with
each chapter devoted to a theme, is designed as far as possible
to make use of the material which is available, to illustrate
developments in attitudes, to, and legislation about, drugs, rather
than to try to cover all the historical ground.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Where I have quoted from early sources, I have where necessary
translated the text into modern English; standardized spelling
(sometimes to personal preference: peyotl rather than the now
more common peyote); and occasionally modified punctuation or
grammar, for clarity. <P>&nbsp;  
<H2>BIBLIOGRAPHY</H2>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
For the sake of brevity, I have omitted standard histories, biographies,
journals, etc.; nor have I listed the individual state papers
which are the chief source of material for the later chapters.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;

<title>The Center of the Universe - Foreword</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2>Foreword </h2>
</center>

<hr>
<center>

<p> <i>It is perfectly natural that man himself should <br>
be the most unintelligible part of the universe.</i> </p>

<p> &#151;Alan Watts</center></p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Man himself is the last frontier. The so-called
hard sciences, the sciences dealing with objects, atoms and
molecules to stars and galaxies, or with numbers, energies,
fields and innumerable abstractions, are nearing a degree of
perfection unimagined in the wildest fantasies of the medieval
alchemists. Yet sciences dealing with man himself, despite the
confident tomes warping the shelves of our libraries and
bookstores, remain in a state of rapid evolution, to put it
kindly. There are even fundamental differences of opinion as to
why the study of humankind is so difficult. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nowhere among the sciences of man do we find
controversy and confusion more rampant than in the study of the
mind. Some, who profess to study only the hardest of objective
facts, have proposed that the mind is nothing but a computer
program. Another school of thought would eliminate mind
altogether. For several decades the academic tyranny of
Behaviorism made it practically obscene even to mention such
words as consciousness, belief, intention or free will in a
scientific journal, a state of affairs which stifled progress in
psychology for half a century. Now it seems, as Jimmy Durante was
fond of remarking, &quot;everybody wants ta' get inta' de
act.&quot; Several top-rate books and a great many articles have
recently appeared, taking up such subjects with a vigor typical
of the aftermath of some prohibition or repression, in this case
a repression of ideas whose development in the work of such
pioneers as William James came to a halt at the beginning of the
20th Century. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is not my intention to berate the many
authors and researchers who have struggled with such problems
over the past several decades. They have faced the most difficult
problems ever faced in the scientific search for truth, and hard
results have been difficult to achieve. Such wide-open fields in
fact provide, and have historically provided the greatest
opportunity for the scientific revolutionary, who should well
know the risks involved in exploring uncharted territory. But I
do wish to stress that with all the so-called progress that 20th
Century science has achieved, there remains a rather large and
important area of understanding that is still in the stone-age of
development: man's understanding of himself; and it<i> </i>is the
difficulty of the subject, not the intelligence of the professors
which is the problem. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With difficult subjects however, we often find
with hindsight that fairly obvious leads were ignored at critical
periods of research: a few strange ideas advanced by some
outsider or non-expert, or some heresy proposed by an iconoclast,
seemingly to cause dismay and discord and without serious value
to ongoing work. Or perhaps anomalous experimental results were
cast aside, ignored as irrelevant or the result of some
undetermined experimental or methodological error. All great
truths begin as blasphemies, noted George Bernard Shaw. As
established experts in a field seldom publish blasphemies, we
might learn something from history and pay more attention to
outsiders, non-experts and the like, for if their suggestions
really are worthless, this should not be difficult to prove, if
the theories and models of the established discipline are in
order and working efficiently. The historian of science Thomas
Kuhn pointed out that scientific revolutions are almost always
initiated by young workers, or those new to the field they
revolutionize. It may be objected that the non-expert has
insufficient grasp of the fundamentals, or is not fluent enough
to distinguish superficial anomalies in a field from important
ones, or is lacking in a command of the accumulated technique of
the discipline thus making the likelihood of his work being the
catalyst for an ensuing scientific revolution negligible. Such
objections would be significant in well-developed sciences: we
would not expect a non-chemist to revolutionize even a small
corner of the field of chemistry, or a truck driver to provide
deep new insights in quantum mechanics. But in a field in which a
generally agreed paradigm seems a far-distant dream, a field
still in the stone-age of development, the outsider, or a
well-read amateur, may well be in a position to supply the key to
revolution. For one thing, he has no great intellectual
investment in one competing school of thought or another. In a
field of study ripe for fundamental change where reputations and
careers are on the line, we might expect the entrenched experts
to be the least likely candidates to introduce revolutionary
hypotheses. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the following pages I propose a rather
wide-ranging theory concerning man, his mind and brain, behavior,
his evolution and anthropology, his sociology and psychology,
religion and apostasy, myth and metaphysic, sciences and
certainties, and it will already be obvious that no writer can
possibly be an expert in such a wide selection of topics. But my
theory may amount to more than armchair speculation if I have
discovered and developed one of the important clues largely
ignored by the experts, one of the leads which with hindsight
will be seen to have provided the key to a revolution in
understanding. Of course my lack of expertise in the subjects I
need to examine must predictably lead to criticism from the
professionals; no doubt I abuse their terminologies and
misinterpret some of the finer points of their disciplines, or
worse. But I believe that the errors noted will be, for the most
part, technicalities, or simply part of the ongoing controversy
in a given field and inconsequential to the overall theory I will
present. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In constructing this theory, and in the present
description of the results of my inquiries, I have tried to live
up to the view expressed by Aldous Huxley, when he saw his
position as one of bridge-builder between areas of knowledge that
had previously been too separated or independent, one body of
knowledge ignoring or even rejecting another for no reason other
than tradition, or as a result of the peculiarities of the way in
which students become trained and indoctrinated in a field. Thus
the durability of the theory I have shaped will be a function not
of the accuracy of fine details which will have to be filled in
or corrected over time, but of the overall concept of the theory
and its ability to combine and predict: Combine disparate aspects
of present understanding and predict future observations and
trends in this primary area of man's search for truth. And if it
is a good theory, it may also provide an understanding which
could assist in improving the condition of man, the relationships
between his societies and nations, and the increasingly fragile
bond linking him with his only available home, the planet Earth. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have tried to write a book which will not only
hold the interest of a wide audience, but contribute to
understanding both by professionals and laymen alike. Thus there
are some autobiographical passages, hopefully entertaining and
illustrative of yet another, hidden side of the cultural and
social upheaval of the 1960's, but the story line is also the
history of the ideas which led to the theory and so is intended
as an enticement for the non-technical reader to think about some
scientific subjects he has probably very little knowledge of, or
interest in. For professional readers, or those laymen who
already are following some of the current debates in the subjects
dealt with here, I have tried to construct the more technical
parts of the book so that they flow smoothly, and are
unencumbered by the myriad definitions and explanations that
would be essential for the non-technical reader. For him, I can
recommend that the more difficult passages may safely be quickly
scanned, and the terms and ideas expressed therein may be better
understood by referring to the Glossary provided at the end of
the book. But a thorough understanding of some of the more
technical evidence for the theory should not be necessary to
grasp its overall intent or scope. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Although it is customary at the beginning of a
book to thank the friends and co-workers who have contributed to
the author's completion of his task, the many persons who have
been instrumental to my own work shall remain unnamed with the
exception of other authors whose works are listed in the
bibliography. I will not single out any names here for special
thanks either, as I have had very limited contact with them
except through their published works. Reasons for these
conditions should soon become obvious from what is to follow. </p>

<title>The Center of the Universe - Chapter 1</title>

<h2>1.&nbsp; Beginnings </h2>
</center>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mexico, early in 1968. With a few friends of
similar disposition, I have left the deteriorating summer-of-love
counter-culture scene of New York City on an adventure destined
to occupy the next quarter-century of my life. We follow in the
footsteps of many other seekers, both professional and amateur,
who have sought to know more about the astonishing collection of
psychoactive plants indigenous to the tropical and semi-tropical
regions of the New World. Native Americans had discovered these
plants many thousands of years before, and almost without
exception they came to be of major importance for the tribes and
civilizations which grew to prominence long before the arrival of
the white man. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Each of us has his own reasons for embarking on
such a voyage, the immediate and conscious reasons each would
have stated having perhaps little to do with underlying
motivations that would be seen as important only from the distant
future. One friend has come along, offering to assist me in my as
yet vague project of finding and experimenting with some of these
mysterious plants. Another is to meet a friend who has
established a modest trade with rural farmers who grow the famed
variety of cannabis known as Acapulco Gold. Another seems merely
to be along for the ride. And of course we are all in that stage
of youth where little risk is perceived in launching into the
most uncertain or unplanned projects with little more than a
total faith in one's ability to improvise. From the wisdom of
middle age, this could only be seen as a recipe for disaster;
from the perspective of youth, it is the essence of opportunity. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But, at least for myself, the hidden catalysts
which propel me in this uncertain direction are not altogether
undiscovered. There is a war going on, I'm supposed to be
fighting it. I'm supposed to be a member of a society which has
been shaped so skillfully with regard to democratic principles
and respect for freedom that it is not only unnecessary, but
indicative of some mental or spiritual pathology to question the
fundamentals of this system which now finds itself living up to
the worst travesties it had imagined of its arch-enemy just a few
years before. My fifth grade teacher had impressed me with the
fact that the reason I didn't know what propaganda was, was that
we simply didn't have that sort of thing here in America. But the
Russians... </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And then there are these persistent ideas
surfacing in my mind about Native Americans, for I had been doing
my homework reading about the many ways in which it could clearly
be seen that, despite all current mythology, it had been the
Native Americans who had had the superior culture and wisdom at
the point of contact between themselves and the European
invaders. It was the white man who had played the role of
barbarian on that sad stage of conquest and slaughter, and it was
now the white man who continued in his supreme arrogance by just
recently outlawing not only the use, but even further research
with these so-called hallucinogenic drugs so important to the
indigenous peoples of the conquered land. According to the
official doctrine, the effect of these drugs is to mimic
psychosis or model something akin to schizophrenia, with the
ever-persistent risk of permanent psychological impairment and
even suicide. Each one of us has had several experiences with a
psychedelic drug and to us it is not the drug experience but the
official doctrine that is psychotic and symptomatic of a severe
collective psychological impairment in society itself. Never, we
feel, was there a successful society so easy to be alienated
from, so absurd in its pronouncements and ongoing policies of
unending conquest. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The enormity of the Great Sin of European
Civilization enters into our conversations only briefly,
obliquely, for these areearly days and we are more attuned to
&quot;what if&quot; than to what was. I have brought along some
rudimentary laboratory equipment and my assistant and I install
ourselves in a little rented bungalow on the outskirts of
Guadalajara. We plan expeditions into the countryside both near
and far to look for the psychedelic plants which beckon like some
species of holy grail oh so unholy to that society we so readily
left behind. At the public market buying oranges we discover we
have already succeeded in our first objective, for on the upper
level there is an entire wing of the market devoted to stalls
selling traditional medicines and shamanic items of the most
diverse character. Peyote cacti are suspended in rows along the
shop windows, and are hawked to gringos passing by. It is
difficult to judge whether the twinkle in the eye of the shamanic
apothecary at the prospect of daily increasing sales of such a
common item is even greater than that in the eye of the
prospective rebel from American Ignorance about to embark on the
most ancient voyage of mankind. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We negotiate for a fifty kilo sack of peyote
cactus to be delivered the next day and depart. To say that our
spirits and anticipation are high captures only the most
sublunary aspects of the moment. Over glasses of orange juice, my
assistant and I review our plans for isolation of a total
alkaloidal extract of the sacramental plant, a preparation that
should produce the exact effect of peyote taken the traditional
way, without the nausea and discomfort produced by the high
content of soap in the raw plant material. The active psychedelic
fraction of the plant we know contains several closely related
alkaloids, and we want to experiment with the hypothesis that
this blend of alkaloids produces a psychedelic experience
superior to that of synthesized mescaline, the principal alkaloid
of the mixture. We have both taken the synthesized alkaloid in
New York on one or more occasions, and although the resulting
experiences were complex, mysterious, highly instructive, and
certainly intense yet gentle, we feel that there was a certain
lack, difficult to put your finger on, of the sense of
spirituality described by those anthropologists and other
researchers who had undergone the experience with the natural
product during the Native American ceremonies. The ritual and
setting of such ceremonies play a major role we know, but our
intent is to test the effect of the psychedelic preparation
itself in determining outcome. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The next few days are occupied with slicing,
preparing, and drying the cactus tops, and we even replant the
conical tuber-like remains so that they have a chance to
regenerate the parts we have amputated. A two-liter Osterizer
blender facilitates a primary extraction with aqueous alcohol,
and a series of liquid-liquid extractions to separate the soaps,
chlorophyll and other miscellaneous impurities results in our
proud possession of a small flask containing an amber,
semi-crystalline syrup, practically odorless but having the
characteristic taste of synthesized mescaline sulfate. From here,
chromatographic or other simple processes would be capable of
separating the mixture into its component alkaloids, but we are
interested in this natural blend and load several double-zero
gelatine capsules with two hundred milligrams of the syrupy
elixir. From this vantage point, the prohibitionist fanaticism of
the land we left only a few weeks ago seems as remote as home
probably seemed to those first barbaric explorers who pillaged
this land and tried to eradicate forever the knowledge of the
mysterious substance we have just bottled. How different our
intentions from those of our ancestors! The sense of triumph over
the collective stupidity of centuries, even on such a small,
fragile, and local scale, perfuses the laboratory and even though
it is very late, we have trouble postponing what we know will be
a twelve hour visionary experience until the morrow.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyone who has tried to write an account of even
a mild psychedelic experience will know the minimal power of
words to describe that which is not only indescribable, but
beyond language itself. Language seems to me as merely a sort of
resonance to experience, coming somewhat after the fact, and
capable of dealing with only the established habits and routines
of thought and perception. The totally novel experience, if such
a concept be allowed, can have no ready-made language patterns to
activate. And perhaps the reverse is true as well: in meditation,
we are told by its adepts, the quieting of the inner dialogue
leads to a purified perception of reality, unsullied by the
categorizing imperatives of language. Freed from such
restrictions, <i>every</i> experience is potentially unique. Even
the most trivial of everyday situations has its originality, but
it is the learned, devastatingly efficient habits of the mind
which cause one to feel that it is necessary to <i>cope</i> with
reality rather than celebrate it. Hence boredom at the apparent
sameness of the events of daily routine displaces the inescapable
but elusive magic of even a moment of life lived with true
freedom. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Somehow the peyote extract we took the next day
produced such a freedom from the known; pure experience seemed to
flow from some mysterious source to which the resonance of
language was not only lacking, but completely superfluous. Those
of us who sat together during that voyage sensed this astonishing
reality not with fear, nor despair at the inability of normal
conscious processes to analyze or explain this strange way of
perceiving, but rather it seemed that this state of mind, this
method of perceiving reality, was aboriginal, the way things
happened long ago when humankind was only beginning his long
journey into civilization. And what was more, we clearly realized
that this aboriginal mode of perception was not at all primitive,
nor limited in its ability to deal with modern life; on the
contrary, it utilized and <i>required</i> the entire capacity of
one's being, it was in fact larger and more comprehensive than
normal everyday, routine consciousness. It seemed that this was
the way the mind would work all the time if it were not being <i>impeded</i>
by the narrow forms mankind had imposed upon himself through the
establishment and maintenance of certain styles of civilized
societies. From that point of view, it was obvious that Western
Man had, step by step, backed himself into a spiritual corner
from which, although he had achieved impressive control of the
mundane, physical aspects of reality, he had lost something not
primitive, but essential. Thus it seemed that the Native
Americans, who had used these miraculous plants as existential
medicines since the beginning, had kept possession of that
something which the white man had long ago lost, and the Native
American societies that resulted were by comparison ecological in
the true sense of the word, having a balance and corresponding
lack of destructive contradiction both within their societies and
also in relation to the environment. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; During the next few days, I began to realize
that with the new restrictions on research with psychedelic
agents, and the continued marginalization of the remnants of
Native American societies, Western Civilization was attempting to
drive the final nail in the coffin of a vast body of psychedelic
knowledge, the culmination of a 500-year-old process designed to
eliminate an embarrassment to the conviction that wisdom and
progress were the rationale behind the spread and hegemony of
European Civilization to every corner of the earth. And not only
the rationale: Western Civilization now appeared to claim to be
the <i>sole possessor</i> of the very <i>concepts</i> of wisdom
and progress. Anything that could be done to dampen this
enthusiasm to ignore, vilify, and destroy everything that was not
Modern, not Capitalism, not Democracy, not Advanced, not
Scientific, not Civilized, not US, I saw as not only a worthwhile
project, but as an undertaking one would be <i>required</i> to do
on the basis of simple moral principles. I had no alternative but
to apply any modest talents or abilities that I might possess to
discovering the mechanisms by which these psychedelic chemicals
produce their effects not only on the brain, but on the mind and
spirit; to finding the link between the widespread use of such
substances among the most ancient tribes of men, and what that
might indicate about the evolution of the human species; to
understanding what the current fanatical attempts to prohibit the
use of these substances and even stifle further research by
qualified scientists indicated about the underlying psychology of
the Modern American Attitude; to discovering whether knowledge
about these and other aspects of psychedelic use might provide a
key so badly needed by the whole range of the sciences of man to
overcome widely recognized limitations of these sciences not only
to explain but above all to improve the deplorable condition of
human social interaction in this century of holocaust. Were these
the medicines of a long-lost age, of no further use to humankind
in his now modern world, or could we discover that they might
still be useful, perhaps essential for a future which did not
include the suicide of the species? </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The moral imperative that I perceived then,
combined with the normal predilection by youth for daring deeds,
left me with little doubt as to my future course of action. The
probability that I would find it necessary to become an outlaw
was of no great consequence to me, it was an exciting concept
that it might be possible to be an outlaw from American
Civilization and be morally justified in doing so. In fact, I was
already an outlaw, a draft-evader, and I had just been dabbling
with forbidden fruits in a most <i>serious</i> way, as a
scientist practicing his art in defiance of the law of the land.
How rare the opportunity to be able to practice a <i>forbidden</i>
science in this day and age! The concept itself put paid to many
arrogant assumptions about the rationality of the American Way of
Life and its justification for eliminating any and all
competition to its oxymoronic Philosophy.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot pretend that the work in which I
engaged over the next several years was serious research on a par
with what our modern academic institutions would accept. But in
light of the severe handicaps that have always been the limiting
factor for progress in the understanding of controversial or
forbidden subjects, I think I may have nevertheless achieved
something of value toward a broadly based theory of psychedelic
experience. Of course there were others, many others, in fact,
who were working on threads of the puzzle presented by modern
man's rediscovery of the ancient psychedelic medicines. Some
researchers who had, previous to the newly instituted
restrictions, been working on the most diverse and interesting
aspects of the effects and uses of psychedelics both therapeutic
and esthetic, continued their work in diminished, or at least
different ways. Although they were forbidden to give a
psychedelic drug to any patient or (more importantly) research
volunteer whatsoever, substitute methods for activating a
psychedelic state were used, sometimes with reasonable success.
Some other workers continued with theoretical work based on
previously accumulated data, and a very few obtained permission
to continue with biochemical experiments with psychedelic drugs
given to various laboratory animals. Sadly, permission for such
work seemed much easier to obtain when the proposed research
might show that the psychedelics were harmful, broke chromosomes,
or lived up in some way to the irrational fears of the
prohibitionist elements in American institutions. But even if
some of these experiments were little more than overdose parties
for rats, they produced, valuable data on, for example, the sites
of action of psychedelics in the brain. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Even more tragically, however, some very gifted
workers left psychedelic research entirely, unable to continue
meaningful work. Prohibition of the use of some substance, like
alcohol, tobacco, tea, cannabis, opium, or anything else you can
name, is historically so easily shown to be self-defeating, that
it bewilders the rational mind to attempt to understand the
philosophical outlook of those otherwise intelligent humans who
propose that man can be protected from folly by the simple
expedient of the passage of law. One would have to hypothesize
ulterior, perhaps unconscious motives on behalf of those who
propose and maintain prohibitions, or conclude that they are not
rational human beings at all. It is several orders of magnitude
more difficult to understand the philosophy of prohibition of an
avenue of scientific research. This is not to say that there
should be no control whatsoever of scientific research activities
by publicly-elected government. If over-enthusiastic pursuit of
profit by biotechnology companies seems to be leading to
dangerous situations such as widespread release of bio-engineered
organisms into the environment, safeguards must be installed: the
biotechnology enterprise is not simply eradicated by fiat.
Government authorities and legislative bodies have not seemed
unduly worried about proven deleterious world-wide effects of
research on nuclear energy or weapons. The prohibitions on
psychedelic research may well indicate ulterior motives and
hidden agendas by those at the center of power. More importantly,
if more difficult to analyze, the prohibition must indicate some
inherent collective psychological conflict at the very core of
the belief system of Modern Western Civilization. It is as if,
collectively, we have no greater fear than that engendered by the
rediscovery of a most ancient, important, and healing practice
and phenomenon, the psychedelic experience. This is most curious,
and I shall return to the topic in chapter 8. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the wake of repression then, there arose
another group of psychedelic researchers, which like other groups
down through the history of acts of repression by the powerful,
was effectively driven underground to an at least temporary
obscurity. In the middle ages we had the alchemists, purportedly
looking for ways to make gold from something less valuable, a
project which certainly would meet the approval of the
acquisitive ecclesiastical authorities of the time. The true
alchemical quest, if we can believe some modern interpretations,
would not at all have met the approval of an authority
proclaiming its monopoly on spiritual matters. No one today would
deny the historical existence of the underground aspect of
alchemy in the middle ages, a science which of course bordered on
witchcraft, wizardry, and sometimes sheer lunacy caused perhaps
in some cases by exposure to toxic heavy metals such as lead and
mercury, favorite substances for the alchemists. Nor will the
modern historian of science deny the influence and importance of
much of the work of the alchemists for the succeeding generations
of researchers who made the beginnings of a modern science out of
a diverse collection of arcane experimental data. But the
existence of underground science today, practiced by a fraternity
of no less colorful and sometimes equally as crazed individuals
as the alchemists, must be dismissed as a fairy tale by those
authorities who have been instrumental in bringing about the very
situation from which underground science must necessarily grow. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Underground science has many limitations and
difficulties which the establishment scientist never need suffer.
There are no universities and publicly financed institutions
allowing research to flourish and researchers to enjoy a
reasonable standard of living including the respect of society
and sometimes even fame and fortune. Under severe repression,
underground scientists have little chance even for peer review of
their work, not to mention journals for publication of their
papers, or conferences, research grants, awards, and always the
threat of moderate to severe penalties meted out by the
Inquisitors, which today includes not burning at the stake, but
languishing incommunicado for periods of time that might make
some wish for a return to the fiery methods of medievalism. With
increasing calls for the application of the death penalty (in the
United States) in cases of &quot;major trafficking&quot;, we may
yet achieve or surpass the medieval traditions. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To be fair, there do exist a few journals, and
some excellent books that have been published during the thirty
years of Inquisition, and even a few conferences have brought
together luminaries in the field of psychedelic research. Since
the late 1980's, a very few limited research projects with humans
have been approved using some types of psychedelic drugs in
treatment programs for addiction or other psychological problems,
or in metabolic studies. But the scope and extent of such
research has not even begun to approach that seen already in the
1950's, and certainly the continuation of important and
productive research of the 1960's, for example on creativity, or
philosophical and religious aspects of the psychedelic
experiencxe, has not even been suggested to government
authorities for approval. And so the fact remains that for the
most important and interesting uses of psychedelics, no one may
give a psychedelic drug to a volunteer human being and then
publish the results without drug police knocking on, and today
often smashing down, the door. Even the time honored tradition of
self-experimentation is cause for arrest, and if one is in the
wrong place at the wrong time with a few bucks not instantly
traceable to justifiable and tax-paid income, civil forfeiture of
all moneys and properties by the defendant (still under the
presumption of innocence) ensues. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If this seems an exaggerated or surrealistic
view of today's world, then the reader is certainly in the
establishment camp. For as an underground scientist who has had
the pleasure of knowing a few other individuals similarly
motivated, I can attest that the fears are real and certainly not
the result of paranoia. I have known several who have languished,
forfeited, or both. I myself am no stranger to enforced
languishing. And it is with a certain caution that I now attempt
to reveal my findings while hoping to retain an intact front
door.</p>

<h2>2.&nbsp; Models and Theories </h2>
</center>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Later on that year. We have slowly been building
up a stock of seeds of the &quot;Heavenly Blue&quot; morning
glory, <i>Ipomoea violacea</i>, which grows widely in this area
of Mexico. A short drive out of the city in any direction leads
to the discovery of some extensive stand of the plant, and we
look for groups of boys playing and gather them 'round for a
short lesson on economic realities. It seems that we offer hard
pesos for anyone who will gather these funny little black seeds
for us, and be here on this spot in exactly one week. Returning
after a week we usually find only one or two of the boys has
taken us seriously and actually collected even a coffee-can full.
But when the scales come out of the back of the pickup, and hard
cash changes hands for what would seem to all excepting gringos a
worthless commodity, eyes widen with dreams of transistor radios.
Mexico is a tragically poor nation, and our harvest of seeds has,
upon last inventory, attained rather amazing levels with very
little expense. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Our peyote experiments have been a resounding
success. We have sent capsules of our extract to several
aficionados of psychedelic preparations, and received very
positive reports comparing the natural alkaloidal blend favorably
with both synthesized mescaline and other psychedelics.
Institutional researchers would of course immediately dismiss our
results as anecdotal and subjective, and we certainly have not
troubled ourselves to do &quot;double-blind&quot; experiments as
would be expected for &quot;scientifically&quot; legitimate
results. The legitimacy of our results is, for better or for
worse, not dependent on institutional acceptance, but upon the
opinions of those whose wisdom we have come to respect. A peyote
shaman, asked to perform a double-blind ceremony using our
preparation, would be as correct to ridicule our idea as the
institutional scientist for criticizing the lack of such
protocol. We quite enjoy the eclecticism of the middle ground we
have staked out for our research paradigm. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The modern institutional requirements for
acceptance of research have been sometimes accused by even
notable scientists as not only too strict and exclusive, but also
as being ignorant of the methods of a great deal of exceptional
and ground-breaking science before the present period. (See for
example the reference in footnote 5, below, for a criticism of
the requirement of &quot;blind&quot; and &quot;double-blind&quot;
techniques.) Single-case studies, subjective reports, experiments
which are not, in principle, repeatable, and other (according to
modern dogma) &quot;non-scientific&quot; methods we are free to
use and interpret with our own guidelines. When an unrepeatable,
subjective experiment leads us to an heuristic or empirical model
and thus provides a component for a theory which then accurately
predicts and points the way for further research, criticism based
upon the nature of the original experiment sends the distinct
message that the critic has &quot;his eyes in his pocket and his
nose on the ground&quot;. And in the field of psychedelic
research, more than any other we know, trying to achieve the
&quot;hardness&quot; of results that academics insist is so
important is often like &quot;trying to catch the wind&quot;. (I
will presently have more to say about our concepts of models and
theories and how they relate to both &quot;hard&quot; science and
to the &quot;softer&quot; disciplines such as our own. And in the
next chapter I will deal with the multitude of purported
&quot;effects&quot; of the psychedelic drugs and why
experimentation has so often led to confusion when the
presumption of classical cause and effect relationships is the
guiding paradigm of experiments.) </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The one significant disappointment of the peyote
extract is that it is unstable. Within even one week, a 500
milligram dose is just perceptibly less potent, and within a
month the potency of the dose is significantly reduced. Since the
stability of the dried cactus tops or &quot;buds&quot; has been
reported to be exceptional, a noted authority on the subject
calling the buds &quot;practically indestructible&quot;, it is
obvious that the &quot;impurities&quot; we have removed in our
process are essential to preserving psychedelic activity of the
raw alkaloidal mixture. This result, combined with the necessity
of processing large volumes of material to produce enough extract
for even twenty or thirty doses, make any practical use of the
product prohibitive. It is expensive to produce and ephemeral. In
addition, we feel that any attempts to produce a stable
preparation by further processing would probably nullify the
advantages of the broad-spectrum alkaloidal extract principle
that we have tested. We have therefore turned our attention to
preparing and experimenting with extracts of the morning glory. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At least two species of morning-glory seed have
been used since antiquity as divinatory agents by the Amerindian
shamans of Mexico. The <i>Ipomoea violacea</i> we have collected
seems to grow just about everywhere, and is, in fact, the exact
same plant that horticulturists have introduced in Europe and the
U.S., the ornamental &quot;Heavenly Blue&quot; morning-glory
vine. The second psychedelic species, <i>Rivea corymbosa</i>, we
have found only further south, but in the scientific literature
its reported habitat is the entire coastal area of the Gulf of
Mexico. We obtained about a kilo of seeds from a local source,
but did not seek out larger quantities since our supply of <i>Ipomoea
violacea </i>was quite sufficient, and of the two species, was
also the most potent. <a name="back1"></a><a href="#footnote1">(1)</a>
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; An interesting page in the history of the
biochemical study of alkaloids was recorded the day in 1960 when
Albert Hofmann presented his findings about the identity of the
alkaloids of the morning-glory to a symposium in Melbourne,
Australia. Until that day, it was believed that the only natural
source of the lysergic acid alkaloids was the parasitic fungus of
grasses, ergot. In the plant kingdom there are extremely diverse
plants, from primitive fungi to the highest species of flowering
plants, that produce the biochemical substances known to chemists
as alkaloids. These natural plant substances are widespread, and
so diverse in their nature that no simple or unique reason for
their evolution can be postulated. And their diversity and
complexity is such that it is rare to find the same alkaloid in
two different plants even if they are close evolutionary
neighbors. When Dr. Hofmann announced that the alkaloids of the
morning-glory vine (a plant far removed on the evolutionary tree
from the primitive ergot fungus) were also derivatives of
lysergic acid, many in the audience of scientists were plainly
incredulous. Despite the impeccable reputation of Dr. Hofmann and
the Sandoz Laboratories of which he was a director, more than one
group of scientists attempted to disprove the findings. One group
thought that the seeds used must have been contaminated with some
species of ergot-like fungus and published a paper to the effect.
Painstaking further work in which seeds were carefully dissected
and shown not to be infected with any type of fungal spore or
growth finally proved the location of the alkaloids to be
concentrated in the embryonic material of the seeds. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We had obtained reprints of all the relevant
scientific papers in New York and were now ready to prepare a
large sample of the morning-glory alkaloids for further
experimentation. As with our peyote extraction, we wished to
obtain a total alkaloidal extract of the seeds even though it had
been postulated by some that only one alkaloid of the group was
the active psychedelic component. Hofmann had shown that probably
four or five lysergic acid derivatives were active: lysergic acid
amide, isolysergic acid amide, lysergol, elymoclavine and perhaps
ergometrine. We thought it of great significance that the first
two of these compounds, and the last as well, have a structure
practically identical to LSD. The fact that the use of LSD-like
psychedelic agents had been as significant as of the peyote
cactus or the psilocybin mushrooms, at least in this area of the
world, made claims that LSD was a modern, synthesized, and
therefore &quot;unnatural&quot; psychedelic drug seem rather
ill-conceived. <a name="back2"></a><a href="#footnote2">(2)</a> </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hofmann and his co-workers had made several
tests of the psychedelic activity of their own extracts, both as
broad spectrum mixtures and also of the separated alkaloids, but
their self-administered dosages had not reliably produced much
more than minor effects. Our first goal would therefore be to
obtain an extract which, when taken in a dose roughly equivalent
to that used in native ceremonies, produced some effects of
significance. We based our extraction procedures both on
published analytical work, on generally accepted routines for
chemical extraction of alkaloids, and gave some consideration as
well to the methods used by the shamans in preparing seeds for
their ceremonies. In tribal use, the seeds are first ground to a
fine flour, then soaked in cold water. After a short time, the
liquid is filtered off and drunk. This would indicate firstly
that the active components were readily soluble in water, and
secondly that other components of the seed, not so readily
soluble, might possibly interfere with the psychedelic effects or
produce diverse effects of their own. Such a hypothesis might
explain the inconsistent results of some workers who had
experimented with <i>Ipomoea </i>or <i>Rivea </i>seeds and found
them lacking in activity. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A second goal for our work would be to try to
obtain pure lysergic acid from the seed extracts by chemical
hydrolysis. A rather large industry had evolved since the turn of
the century which produced the alkaloid ergotamine from a
laborious process of growing the ergot fungus on rye grass.
Ergotamine had been a widely used lysergic acid alkaloid for
decades, but recently other derivatives of lysergic acid had been
found to be more useful, and to produce them, the ergotamine
yield from ergot was first hydrolyzed to lysergic acid, then
appropriately reacted with various amines or other compounds. It
was work of this type that had led Hofmann to synthesize LSD by
reacting pure lysergic acid, via an intermediate, with
diethylamine. We intended to evaluate the possibility that
morning glory seeds might someday provide an alternate, or even
better source for lysergic acid than the ergot/rye process. <a
name="back3"></a><a href="#footnote3">(3)</a> We would at the
same time be determining if it were possible for an underground
chemist, using morning glory seeds instead of ergotamine (which
was tightly controlled and difficult to obtain), might produce
small amounts of LSD with very little risk. I say small amounts,
because the alkaloid content of morning glory seeds had been
assessed at barely 0.06%, and assuming normal losses and other
factors it would therefore be necessary to process perhaps a
hundred kilos of seeds or more to produce even a gram of LSD.
Still, due to the vanishingly small effective dose of LSD, such a
process was far more a practical possibility than that
necessitated by the required minimum dose of peyote extract, more
than two thousand fold that of LSD.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With a view to obviating any objections that
publishers, general readers, or various drug control authorities
might have concerning the description of processes used to
produce forbidden substances, I will not further discuss here our
experiments along these lines. Any competent underground chemist
will certainly, in any case, already know quite enough to
formulate his plans for the future. And it should already be
evident to the reader what my evaluation of the prohibition of
psychedelics signaled about my own intentions. To me, it was one
of the greatest absurdities ever perpetrated that persons of
reasonable attitude and situation, and with proper guidance,
might not have access to substances which had proved not only
valuable, but essential to so many societies of man down through
the ages. If societies that we ignorantly called primitive could
use these medicines to advantage, where was the logic in the
belief that suddenly these same substances presented some kind of
grave threat to man in the Twentieth Century? One of the top
prohibitionist agitators of the time had made the preposterous
statement that LSD was &quot;the greatest threat facing the
country today...more dangerous than the Vietnam War.&quot;<a
name="back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">(4)</a> If certain excesses
and unwise use of the psychedelics were appearing in American
society it was not very difficult to see that if one single thing
could be designated a cause of the problem, it was the
prohibition itself. And how could a society purportedly so
grounded in the logic, rationality, and intellectuality
illustrated by its great scientific achievements come to be so
hoodwinked, so <i>deprived </i>of its rationality, so easily led
into absurdity, when it came to the subject of &quot;drugs&quot;?
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; One clue came from the observation that it
seemed necessary to have had some personal experience with the
substances. This very same problem had been observed in the early
days of psychedelic research, before Prohibition. Almost without
exception, the researchers who had themselves taken psychedelic
drugs produced much more intelligible and significant work than
those who had abstained, for one reason or another. But soon the
abstainers were publishing accusations that personal exposure to
the substances had caused researchers to be biased, even that
they had suffered permanent deformations of personality, were
delusional and no longer competent to judge the results of their
own experiments. Two researchers, Cole and Katz, went so far as
to flatly state in a paper that &quot;only claims made by
therapists who have not themselves taken LSD are valid&quot;<a
name="back5"></a><a href="#footnote5">(5)</a>. As Osmond wryly
observed, the same critics who were accusing enthusiastic
researchers of having suffered permanent personality changes due
to their use of psychedelics, were at the same time <i>denying</i>
that such personality changes could be brought about in
experimental subjects or patients! </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed to us that if such irrational battles
were raging in the halls of academia, the only hope for the
common man to see behind the curtain obscuring the wisdom of the
ages was to be persuaded by a friend to find out for himself. The
knowledge of psychedelics was then something that would have to
pass from hand to hand among friends of mutual trust and respect;
that same knowledge would be met publicly only with outright
rejection, or worse: a situation of superb medievalism right here
in modern America. Despite the apparent confidence of Modern
Civilization that it was the very epitome of rationality, the
issue of the prohibition of psychedelics had to be diagnosed as
indicative of grave underlying contradictions in the paradigms
and beliefs of that civilization. And the nature of these
contradictions could only be understood by viewing them as a
collective psychological phenomenon, a view which took on a
certain forcefulness and poignancy from within the psychedelic
experience itself. What a privilege to be party to such
knowledge! And it was more than mere knowledge, it was Wisdom for
it made you weep to see it thus, and to realize the odds against
counteracting or curing the situation, even on the simplest of
levels. To correct <i>one's own </i>metaphysical outlook in the
midst of such confuision was already an unlikely achievement for
most, even <i>with </i>psychedelic assistance.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I should now briefly discuss the meanings of
certain terms I have been using. Models, theories, paradigms,
hypotheses, even data, knowledge and wisdom can be thrown about
rather loosely in today's writing, their meaning more dependent
on the intended audience of a book than on precise definitions.
If the definitions I will now give are not acceptable to all,
then at least I will be saying what I, personally, take these
terms to mean, and what they should be considered to mean when I
use them here. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At the beginning, in those early days in Mexico,
I certainly had no idea of searching for a <i>theory</i> of
psychedelic experience. In retrospect, after the passage of many
years, I see that the work that I did and the experiences I
gained, combined with further study that has occupied a large
part of my time ever since, fit into a pattern the structure of
which now seems to constitute a rather interesting and
multi-faceted <i>theory </i>about the psychedelic experience, its
place in anthropology and evolution, the mechanisms of its
functioning, etc. Thus a theory is a broad and explanatory view
of a panorama of topics united by a central fact or aspect of
reality. A theory is a theory of <i>something</i>, although it
may deal with the most diverse subjects in the explaining of that
central something. But it falls short of being a paradigm in the
Kuhnian sense, <a name="back6"></a><a href="#footnote6">(6)</a>
because it is an expressed, conscious and explicit structure,
continually in the state of further refinement and development.
The paradigm is rather a theory or set of theories that has
become transparent to the community or society that employs it in
their world view. It is a set of implicit principles and views
that are so taken for granted that individual components of the
paradigm are often quite difficult to discover, so enmeshed are
they in the view they represent. A paradigm is also static, or
nearly so, it is not normally developing with the addition of new
experimental evidence. This is why it is found that a paradigm
becomes obsolete, and is <i>replaced </i>by a new paradigm. A
theory in development, on the other hand, may evolve in such
complex ways that it arrives at a point which may be radically
changed from its original form. Thus I do not claim that my
theory is in any way a paradigm, or a revolution in the
underlying assumptions and world-view now reigning in Western
Civilization. But the theory may, in combination with other
theories, eventually contribute to such a revolution, as I hope
it will. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The elements which make up a theory are <i>models</i>,
and may take many forms. A model may be logical, deductive,
mathematical, and completely abstract as in the description of a
certain process or phenomenon by an equation or set of equations.
Einstein's mathematical description of curved space is a good
example: no exercise of the imagination can produce a concrete
vision of how empty space might be <i>curved</i>, curvature is
always in our experience a curvature of <i>something</i>, and if
empty space is anything, it is nothing, not something, according
to the common sense way our minds work. The mathematical model of
curvature of space makes up a part of the general relativistic <i>theory</i>
of the structure of the universe. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Other models may be practically photographic in
their imaginability. The planetary model of the atom with its
discrete orbiting electrons around a hard little nucleus of
another flavor of &quot;stuff&quot; is still a quite useful way
of picturing matter at this level. Notice in this example, that
the model may be useful, at the very minimum as a teaching aid,
even when the &quot;reality&quot; the model describes has been
shown to be something quite more complex and nebulous. In
&quot;reality&quot;, the quantum-mechanical model of atomic
structure indicates that electrons are far more like probability
clouds or waves than little hard individual particles. Thus a
model such as the planetary one may be strictly analogical,
metaphorical, perhaps even an outright &quot;lie&quot;, and still
retain some usefulness in representing aspects of a theory. The
theory of chemical combination of atoms into compounds, as in the
reaction of sodium and chlorine to form common salt, for
instance, can still profit from the planetary model of the atom. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And when we get to the study of life sciences,
where &quot;hard&quot; data is often difficult to come by, a
model may even fall short of the imaginable metaphor; it may
simply be the result of a process of curve-fitting and
extrapolation of seemingly random points on a graph, the
extrapolation and predictions of the model executed with little
more than sheer intuition. Thus a model may range from the
logical and deductive hardness of a precise mathematical
equation, to something as fleeting and a-logical as a sudden
inspiration or intuition about the object of study and how it
might behave under various conditions. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Here we might note that a model, no matter how
precise it may appear, is never a complete or &quot;true&quot;
picture of reality, it is merely a temporary <i>device</i> used
to form hypotheses about what kind of experiments to perform.
Thus a model can be something as simple as an assumed viewpoint
taken just to see what that viewpoint might lead to; it functions
as an heuristic aid toward the formation of testable ideas, ideas
which have a high probability of being relevant, either
positively or negatively, for the formation of a theory. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A model is thus a device helping to form
hypotheses which are then tested experimentally. The results of
experiments then can be used to form an improved model, or an
alternative model, and this circular process may proceed at great
length until a summation process has suggested the outline of a
full-fledged <i>theory</i>. But the theory that results is more
than just another model, or collection of models, for it is more
than just a device: it is something complex, an intricate pattern
of relations which in a very significant way is more than just
the sum of its parts, because a good theory will have many
implications and ramifications beyond those which are immediately
evident, or those which took part in its formation. A good theory
provides a framework around which further modeling and
experimentation falls into place almost spontaneously, rather
like the growth of a crystal around a small seed particle
immersed in a supersaturated solution. It is perhaps like a
nearly-completed jigsaw puzzle, which although was fitted
together from pieces which at times only seemed to fit
approximately, the overall intelligibility of the emerging scene
lends great weight to its probable accuracy and applicability,
and further pieces of the puzzle seem to fall into place almost
effortlessly. A bad theory, by contrast, tends to accumulate
ever-increasing anomaly and counter-argument against it, and it
winds up being defended by its last remaining protagonists using
the most spectacular of intellectual gymnastics, to no avail. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus a good theory may contain among the many
models used to construct and support it models which, considered
alone, are difficult to accept, or even completely unbelievable
in light of previously accepted theory and paradigms. Many of the
models or pieces of the theory I will now describe will certainly
fall into this category for some readers, particularly those with
established professional viewpoints to defend. In the next
chapter, for example, I am going to attack the currently accepted
model that psychedelic drugs cause a wide range of unpredictable
and multi-faceted effects. Most people would not even call this a
model, they would call it simple observation! The alternative
model I will propose is deceptively simple, if somewhat tricky to
explain, and to support it I have had to create new models of
psychological functioning replacing some current models which
themselves are so generally transparent and accepted that their
status as models would be questioned. Here is the process
described above where anomaly leads to an alternate model of some
phenomenon, which leads to experiments, further models, further
experiments, and so on until an entire theory begins to take
shape. If in those early days in Mexico I hadn't the least
inkling that I was working on a <i>theory</i>, I <i>was</i>
consciously searching for models which made my experiences and
experiments begin to conform to a tentative pattern. And at that
stage of creative work, it is of advantage to dream up even the
wildest and most unlikely models along with the more obvious
ones; only once a theory is consciously in the making is more
rigorous selection warranted. (This process of the evolution of a
theory parallels what we see in biological evolution: in the
early stages, the wildest and most bizarre life forms are tried.
Later on, after disastrous extinctions have wiped out entire
phyla, the course of evolution is found to be much more
conservative). </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once the outline of an emerging theory is in
place, research may begin to scan widely in many areas. Research
may at times consist largely of reading about and re-interpreting
results of experiments performed by others, from the new
viewpoint represented by the maturing theory. New ways of
organizing and explaining data in areas as yet unexamined by the
theory begin to show that the theory either has wide
implications, or is not as comprehensive as previously thought.
This process of testing the theory against many new areas of
understanding is what finally yields the most interesting
results. For example, just recently I began reading about the new
research on brain function now made possible by the latest
methods of brain-scanning techniques such as PET and MRI.
Interpreting much of the data collected in terms of the
psychological and cognitive models I had invented for the
psychedelic theory was not only possible, but led to a further
refinement of those models and a strengthening of the theory as
well. It was especially interesting to note that some of the
brain-scan results which had so far only been interpreted in very
tentative ways, could be explained rather well using the
psychedelic models of brain function versus cognitive process
proposed by my theory. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Now that the background has been constructed, it is with
    pleasure and relief that I launch my theory of psychedelic
    experience into certainly turbulent waters. If it be based on
    delusion and self-deception the sinking will be so rapid as
    to be unnoticed, saving me intense embarrassment; if there is
    a glimmer of truth therein, the violence of the storm in
    which it must survive might sink it as quickly. I can only
    grease the ways well and hope I have not left any gaping
    holes in its structure! </p>

two species of morning-glory and their use by Mexican Amerindian
tribes including a few isolated groups still today, the reader is

Hofmann was later to show, there is a strong probability that an
LSD-type psychedelic preparation was also, over a period of two
millennia, an important and integral part of religious and
intellectual life in an area of the world much closer to our
Western Civilization, ancient Greece. See <i>The Road to Eleusis,

that two pharmaceutical companies, Sandoz and Farmitalia, were
perfecting a method to grow the mycelium of ergot fungus in
stirred vats filled with nutrients. This process was able to
produce high yields of an alkaloid much easier to use for further
synthesis than ergotamine, paspalic acid. With the introduction
of this method, other processes depending on production and
harvest of either ergot or morning glories would be of little
comparative utility. <a href="#back3">(back)</a> </p>

<h2>3.&nbsp; Effects of Psychedelic Drugs </h2>
</center>

<hr>

<blockquote>
    <p>(I had originally thought to write a chapter on the
    history of use of psychedelic drugs, but there have already
    been several excellent books and research papers published in
    this area, and I have nothing new to add. <a name="back1"></a><a
    href="#footnote1">(1)</a> At the risk of leaving out an
    important body of substantiating evidence for parts of my
    theory, including the history of what have been thought to be
    the various effects of the drugs, I will simply recommend
    that the reader acquaint himself with the subject from the
    already prolific selection of works, many of which are listed
    in the Bibliography. The risk is that a reader who holds some
    prejudice that psychedelic use has merely been the province
    of a few oddball tribes, or something that could be safely
    ignored when theorizing in anthropology or human biological
    and social evolution, will therefore hold the same prejudice
    when trying to evaluate my theory. Nothing could be further
    from the truth. Psychedelic use appears to be the rule,
    rather than the exception, in every corner of the earth where
    man has developed. And not just in times we may safely
    relegate to the stone age: I have already mentioned the
    strong likelihood that lysergic acid alkaloids were important
    in Greek Civilization over a period of two <i>thousand</i>
    years. Once acquainted with the wealth of evidence concerning
    early use of psychedelic drugs, the reader or researcher who
    then picks up a new book on anthropology, religion, human
    evolution and the evolution of consciousness and finds no
    relevant entries in the index, will have immediate and
    compelling reasons to question the author's scholarship! </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The discontinuance of use of psychedelics for most
    non-Western societies seemed to coincide with the arrival of
    European &quot;civilizing&quot; influence, yet stubborn
    traces of psychedelic use persisted widely until modern
    times, as witnessed by recent studies of Central and South
    American Amerindian tribes, and of course the widely known
    use of peyote by members of the Native American Church. The
    discontinuance of psychedelic use in Western Civilization
    itself coincided with the rise of the Roman Church as the
    primary political power in the world. From the early
    centuries of the Christian epoch, the use of such substances
    became the occupation of heretics, outcasts, witches,
    primitives or other similarly uncivilized, satanic elements. <a
    name="back2"></a><a href="#footnote2">(2)</a> The Church, of
    course, saw no contradiction in the wholesale slaughter of
    such groups for their own good. Continuing psychedelic use
    over the centuries in many parts of the world has thus been a
    carefully guarded secret, and modern estimates of its
    frequency and importance are probably grossly
    underestimated.) </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The extract of <i>Ipomoea violacea</i> that we
had prepared radiated power, just sitting there in its flask. A
light amber, odorless syrup which, in the darkened laboratory
fluoresced brilliantly blue under ultraviolet light, it was an
extreme contrast with the series of messy, difficult to purify,
dark-colored and discouraging volumes of intermediate sludge we
had treated, and brought to mind the Curies and their arduous
separation of a few tiny crystals of glowing radium from a
mountain of pitchblende. The difficulties had, however, taught us
much about ways in which we would modify our processes for future
work. As for the extract, the following day would see the first
test of its activity, with myself as the guinea-pig. I was by
this time hardly a novice in self-administration of my own
preparations or in the estimation of what effects they might
have. I was, in fact, quite adept at taking most any supposed
substance of enlightenment and avoiding nasty complications if
the brew turned out to be bogus. On many occasions in New York,
more than a little caution had been required to avoid not only
the classic &quot;rip-off&quot; but also the inevitable dangers
that Prohibition naturally produced. Once, a purported sample of
magic mushroom I was offered proved to be only a few wasted
store-bought champignons laced with powdered datura seeds.
Although hallucinogenic, the experience of datura was not the
least insightful, nor did it leave me with an experience which
hinted at dimensions normally closed to everyday perception. I
spent a few unpleasant hours also with Owsley's famous STP, which
in the original dose was far too potent for human consumption.
Fortunately I took only a quarter-dose, there having been
evidence of difficult times for others with this synthetic drug. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The morning-glory extract provided not a nasty
surprise, but a powerful surprise none the less. It was by far
the most powerful experience I had yet encountered. Perhaps the
methods of our extraction had yielded a product more
representative of the shaman's recipe than the preparations
obtained by other investigators, who reported only modest
psychedelic effects. The experience of that day was hardly
modest, from the beginning moments it certainly did not fail to
inspire reverence and humility, no matter what the direction to
which I managed to guide it. The colors and geometric patterns,
the rippling waves so often seen in watching clouds in the sky,
the slowing of time and other typical effects so frequently
described in the literature had some time ago become only minor
and unattended aspects of psychedelic experience for me.
Certainly, I still noticed these effects, if I took the trouble
to pay attention to them. But the psychedelic experience had
become for me far more an arena for the Herculean task of
attempting to achieve the truly original perspective for viewing
the fundamental questions that man has posed since the beginning
of time. It was the task of freeing oneself <i>completely </i>from
preconceptions, from habits of thinking that affected the outcome
of seeking in unknown and unconscious ways. And of course, it was
paradoxical, if not impossible to erase these filters of
comprehension completely. To a very significant extent,
comprehension <i>consisted of </i>these filters. Nevertheless,
the psychedelic experience seemed to go quite a good distance in
providing this ability, if one were ready to use it. Particularly
the experience of that day. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; An additional very serious question that I have
examined practically every time I undergo an experience is that
of my position in giving a psychedelic drug that I have prepared
to another person. The peyote extract, and now the morning-glory
alkaloids would be given to friends, and their friends perhaps,
and it seemed necessary to explore where the experience of these
substances might lead for others than myself. As I indicated
above, I would recommend datura for no-one, and Owsley's
invention I would strongly recommend against. In the case of
providing a psychedelic that I myself have prepared, it is a
great responsibility, not so much for any immediate risk that an
experience might entail, but rather in the sense that one thus
becomes a shaman who <i>initiates </i>another human being into
awareness of that mysterious something that forever remains just
out of reach. The responsibility is to ensure that the one
initiated shall see the significance of this event, of this
process of initiation. If not, the ability of a person to achieve
such insight may be stifled, if not completely eliminated from
that point on, and it is his shaman who is to blame. It is like
saving someone's life, in the way some oriental philosophies
understand it, if the initiation is successful. Many people, of
course, are capable of initiating themselves, I certainly had,
and so had many others I had known. But to manufacture
psychedelic substances and distribute them widely and at random,
as had been done recently in the United States, left something
important out of the equation describing the power of these
substances to affect important changes in those who experienced
them, and in society at large. On the other hand, I could not
ignore the argument that the Prohibition had denied man one of
his most fundamental rights, and according to the wisdom
expressed by the American Constitutional scholar Alexander
Bickel, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We cannot, by total reliance on law, escape the duty to
    judge right and wrong... There are good laws and there are
    occasionally bad laws, and it conforms to the highest
    traditions of a free society to offer resistance to bad laws,
    and to disobey them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The details of the morning-glory experience that
day had much more to do with my personal idiosyncrasies of the
time than with issues relevant to the present narrative. At a
high point of the experience, a minor earthquake occurred which,
for the life of me, seemed to be provoked by my patterns of
thought, seeking answers to questions that had a certain air of
being forbidden, questions that no mortal could support the
weight of significance the answers would unload upon him. The
whole scene would of course be dismissed as an hallucination by
my analyst, if I had one. But the earth tremor was real, and it
did coincide with the climax of certain thoughts I was
entertaining. Although the details of such experiences may
sometimes represent battles of the self against its own quirks
and limitations, and on a personal level I have quite
satisfactorily concluded what the experiences of that day had to
teach, one still gains a cumulative and more generally applicable
knowledge from profound psychedelic experience. And I believe it
was the experience of that day which first started me thinking
about the &quot;effects&quot; that these substances produced,
trying to understand how they could be so different from person
to person and from experience to experience. (And the experience
of that day seemed to indicate that psychedelics might possibly
cause earthquakes!) </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Some researchers had proposed that the effects
of psychedelics were more the result of <i>set and setting </i>than
of the drug <i>per se</i>. This seemed to be a useful model as
far as it went, but really it didn't go very far in my opinion.
The <i>setting</i> of a psychedelic experience was simply the
surroundings, the comfortable living room or beautiful garden to
be contrasted with the sterile and sometimes threatening
atmosphere of the hospital wards where some early research had
been carried out. The <i>set </i>was defined as the attitudes,
motivations, preconceptions, and intentions of the individual, in
combination with the introductory ideas and instructions that
were provided by the researchers or guides, if any. Here is a
short illustrative example: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Language, however, may...be used to develop a negative set
    and setting. Jean Houston (1967) has described one of her
    initial observations of LSD administration. The subject was
    told by the psychiatrist that he would have &quot;a terrible,
    terrible experience&quot; filled with &quot;strong anxiety
    and delusions.&quot; The drug was administered in an
    antiseptic hospital room with several observers in white
    coats watching him. As the effects came on, the psychiatrist
    asked such questions as, &quot;Is your anxiety
    increasing?&quot; At the end of the experiment, the subject
    was in a state of panic. The psychiatrist announced to the
    group that LSD is indeed a &quot;psychotomimetic&quot;
    substance, which induces psychotic behavior. <a name="back3"></a><a
    href="#footnote3">(3)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now here is a shaman who has failed most
miserably in his responsibilities. What was so appalling about
some of this early &quot;scientific&quot; research with
psychedelics, was that it was structured not with just an
ignorance, but a <i>willful</i> ignorance of methods used by the
aboriginal practitioners of the same curing arts as the modern
psychiatrists professed to practice. Peyote shamans in the
western states of the US were very likely that same day
conducting psychedelic sessions in a somewhat different manner: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The ritual developed by the Native American Church
    illustrates the use of language to produce a positive set and
    setting for the ingestion of peyote. A ceremonial leader, the
    head chief, initiates the singing of songs and co-ordinates
    requests by individuals for special prayers. The ritual is so
    arranged and so coordinated to the needs of the communicants
    that the maximum possible likelihood of a positive spiritual
    experience is enhanced.<a name="back4"></a> <a
    href="#footnote4">(4)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If the prospect of singing for his patients
would seem absurd to the modern psychiatrist, he is also
willfully ignorant of the great many psychedelic studies in which
recorded music and other aesthetic input was successfully used to
create positive set and setting. The work of Hoffer and Osmond,
or of Masters and Houston are good examples: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The LSD treatment is conducted in a comfortable,
    aesthetically pleasing, spacious room, in no way suggestive
    of a clinical setting...the therapist wears ordinary street
    clothes or something more casual, depending on the needs of
    the patient. No medical or scientific &quot;uniform&quot;
    should be worn. The session should be presented less as
    therapy than as educational and developmental experience. The
    therapist steps out of his role as &quot;doctor&quot; and
    becomes more the patient's mentor and guide, who will lead
    him through the unique world of psychedelic experience and
    enable him to profit from it... </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Psychedelic drugs, such as LSD and
mescaline, give rise to awesome and extraordinary mental changes
in which perceptions are so altered from normal human experience,
they cannot readily be described.&quot; Many similar statements
have been made, this one is by Solomon H. Snyder in his book <i>Drugs
and the Brain</i>. <a name="back6"></a><a href="#footnote6">(6)</a>
If the concept of set and setting as the determining parameter of
the content of psychedelic experience has only limited value for
understanding statements such as Snyder's, we need a new model
which not only is capable of showing what cognitive and
neurological mechanisms could facilitate such experiences, how
the drug might catalyze or initiate a chain of events the content
of which would depend entirely on the individual, but also
showing why statements about the psychedelic experience have so
far been themselves awesome and extraordinary yet decidedly
lacking in explanatory power. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am going to propose a view that attributing
fantastic and indescribable effects to psychedelic drugs is naive
and misleading. From all we know about the complexity,
ineffability, and continually surprising nature of the human
mind, attribution of such causal power to a molecule seems a mere
projection, and a symptom of the unwillingness to contemplate
these characteristics of the mind directly. Neither can we
justify attributing such power to mere molecules in view of what
is known about the neurological effects of psychoactive drugs in
general. The primary neurological effects of psychedelics, like
other drugs which affect the central nervous system, must be
relatively simple, localized, and perhaps only minimally
connected in time with the supposed fantastic attributes which
follow. All the facts point toward a simple, quite easily
explained mechanism for the neurological action of LSD or other
psychedelics. How the mind reacts to this simple change in
nervous system operation is another matter, for here it is the
complexity of mind itself in question. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The argument is that what LSD or other
psychedelic drugs do is simple, what the mind does complex, and
if the event of ingesting a psychedelic substance is followed by
some amazing mental events, it must be the case that the mind is
capable of such events all on its own, or under a variety of
diverse influences. The drug is in no sense analogous to a
computer program, causing the brain and mind to submit to its
instructions; if it were, the effects of the drug would be far
more reproducible and typical. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Before describing what simple mechanism could
allow a psychedelic drug to catalyze the events of psychedelic
experience, let us take a closer look at what have been touted as
the &quot;effects&quot; of psychedelic drugs. My task will be to
show how each of these effects is not strictly an effect of the
drug itself, but one of the many things the mind <i>may</i> do
under various circumstances, one being a certain small yet
fundamental change in neurological routines provoked by a drug.
The choice of the word 'catalyze' is appropriate, I think, for in
chemistry the action of a catalyst is to lower an energy barrier
which prevents a reaction from happening, not to actually take
part in the reaction itself. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As a starting point in my theory therefore, let
us think of the effect of a psychedelic drug as eliminative of
some obstacle, rather than additive: the drug functions as a
facilitator of inherently possible processes, a substance which
by its neurological action <i>allows or assists</i> certain
natural processes to occur which might otherwise be rare or
improbable. In the following quotation, let us see if we can
understand each &quot;effect&quot; not as something that a
psychedelic drug <i>does</i>, but as something which <i>we</i>
might do, if only rarely, under certain circumstances. The list
below, although originally compiled as a phenomenology of ASC's <a
name="back7"></a>(7) in general (including hypnosis, religious
trance, delirious states, various intoxications other than
psychedelic, etc.), has been widely agreed to represent the major
characteristics observed of the psychedelic state, although some
improvement in their description could be imagined. Where
applicable, I have edited the descriptions to accord with
psychedelic experience alone: </p>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>A. Alterations in thinking</b>. Subjective disturbances
    in concentration, attention, memory, and judgment represent
    common findings. Archaic modes of thought (primary-process
    thought) predominate, and reality testing seems impaired to
    varying degrees. The distinction between cause and effect
    becomes blurred, and ambivalence may be pronounced whereby
    incongruities or opposites may coexist without any
    (psycho)logical conflict... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>B. Disturbed time sense</b>. Sense of time and
    chronology become greatly altered. Subjective feelings of
    timelessness, time coming to a standstill, the acceleration
    or slowing of time, and so on, are common. Time may also seem
    of infinite or infinitesimal duration. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>C. Loss of control</b>. As a person enters or is in an
    ASC, he often experiences fears of losing his grip on reality
    and losing his self-control. During the induction phase, he
    may actively try to resist experiencing the ASC...while in
    other instances he may actually welcome relinquishing his
    volition and giving in to the experience. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>D. Change in emotional expression</b>. With the
    diminution of conscious control or inhibitions, there is
    often a marked change in emotional expression. Sudden and
    unexpected displays of more primitive and intense emotion
    than shown during normal, waking consciousness may appear.
    Emotional extremes, from ecstasy and orgiastic equivalents to
    profound fear and depression, commonly occur... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>E. Body image change</b>. A wide array of distortions
    in body image frequently occur in ASCs. There is also a
    common propensity for individuals to experience a profound
    sense of depersonalization, a schism between body and mind,
    feelings of derealization, or a dissolution of boundaries
    between self and others, the world, or universe. There are
    also some other common features which might be grouped under
    this heading. Not only may various parts of the body appear
    or feel shrunken, enlarged, distorted, heavy, weightless,
    disconnected, strange, or funny, but spontaneous experiences
    of dizziness, blurring of vision, weakness, numbness,
    tingling, and analgesia are likewise encountered. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>F. Perceptual distortions</b>. Common to most ASCs is
    the presence of perceptual aberrations, including
    hallucinations, pseudohallucinations, increased visual
    imagery, subjectively felt hyperacuteness of perception, and
    illusions of every variety. The content of these perceptual
    aberrations may be determined by cultural, group, individual,
    or neurophysiological factors and represent either
    wish-fulfillment fantasies, the expression of basic fears or
    conflicts, or simply phenomena of little dynamic import, such
    as hallucinations of light, color, geometrical patterns, or
    shapes. In some ASCs, such as those produced by psychedelic
    drugs, marihuana, or mystical contemplation, synesthesias may
    appear whereby one form of sensory experience is translated
    into another form. For example, persons may report seeing or
    feeling sounds or being able to taste what they see. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>G. Change in meaning or significance</b>. After
    observing and reading descriptions of a wide variety of ASCs
    induced by different agents or maneuvers, I have become very
    impressed with the predilection of persons in these states to
    attach an increased meaning or significance to their
    subjective experiences, ideas, or perceptions. At times, it
    appears as though the person is undergoing an attenuated
    &quot;eureka&quot; experience during which feelings of
    profound insight, illumination, and truth frequently occur. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>H. Sense of the ineffable</b>. Most often, because of
    the uniqueness of the subjective experience associated with
    certain ASCs (e.g., transcendental, aesthetic, creative,
    psychotic, and mystical states), persons claim a certain
    ineptness or inability to communicate the nature or essence
    of the experience to someone who has not undergone a similar
    experience. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>I. Feelings of rejuvenation. </b>...On emerging from
    certain profound alterations of consciousness (e.g.,
    psychedelic experiences, ...hypnosis, religious conversion,
    transcendental and mystical states), ...many persons claim to
    experience a new sense of hope, rejuvenation, renaissance, or
    rebirth. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>J. Hypersuggestibility</b>. &#133;The increased
    susceptibility and propensity of persons uncritically to
    accept and/or automatically to respond to specific
    statements...or nonspecific cues (i.e., cultural or group
    expectations for certain types of behavior or subjective
    feelings). Hypersuggestibility will also refer to the
    increased tendency of a person to misperceive or misinterpret
    various stimuli or situations based either on his inner fears
    or wishes. <a name="back8"></a><a href="#footnote8">(8)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Or consider the following list of effects: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>LSD and peyote are potent psycho-chemicals that alter and
    expand the human consciousness. Even the briefest summation
    of the psychological effects of these drugs would have to
    include the following: Changes in visual, auditory, tactile,
    olfactory, gustatory, and kinesthetic perception; changes in
    experiencing time and space; changes in the rate and content
    of thought; body image changes; hallucinations; vivid
    images&#151;eidetic images&#151;seen with the eyes closed;
    greatly heightened awareness of color; abrupt and frequent
    mood and affect changes; heightened suggestibility; enhanced
    recall or memory; depersonalization and ego dissolution;
    dual, multiple, and fragmentized consciousness; seeming
    awareness of internal organs and processes of the body;
    upsurge of unconscious materials; enhanced awareness of
    linguistic nuances; increased sensitivity to nonverbal cues;
    sense of capacity to communicate much better by nonverbal
    means, sometimes including the telepathic; feelings of
    empathy; regression and &quot;primitivization&quot;;
    apparently heightened capacity for concentration;
    magnification of character traits and psychodynamic
    processes; an apparent nakedness of psychodynamic processes
    that makes evident the interaction of ideation, emotion, and
    perception with one another and with inferred unconscious
    processes; concern with philosophical, cosmological, and
    religious questions; and, in general, apprehension of a world
    that has slipped the chains of normal categorical ordering,
    leading to an intensified interest in self and world and also
    to a range of responses moving from extremes of anxiety to
    extremes of pleasure. These are not the only effects of the
    psychedelic drugs... <a name="back9"></a><a href="#footnote9">(9)</a>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The authors here do not leave any doubt about
their attribution of causes, but to be fair, it must be stated
that the more cautious researchers seemed aware, at least to some
extent, of the difficulties in such attributions, although
without taking the trouble to deny the implication. Hoffer and
Osmond put it thus: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The LSD experience is one about which there can be no
    argument about priorities between chemical and psychological
    factors. For there is no doubt whatever the chemical is given
    first and must cause the biochemical changes <i>which later
    find expression </i>in the psychological experience... A good
    deal is known about its [LSD's] phenomenal reactivity. What
    is not known is which one of its many biochemical reactions
    is the most relevant in producing the psychological changes.
    [italics added]. <a name="back10"></a><a href="#footnote10">(10)</a>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The authors could be accused of semantic
prestidigitation here, but I think it was more a matter of the
difficulty of understanding the psychedelic experience rather
than a conscious effort to make a statement that would be right
no matter what the actual pathway of cause and effect turned out
to be. Many researchers of the time show a dawning awareness in
their published works of the unsatisfactory implications of the
application of classical cause and effect paradigms to many of
the more unusual findings in psychedelic research. But if some
researchers did not go so far as to state flatly that LSD <i>causes
</i>mystical experience, or that LSD <i>causes </i>perceptual
time distortions, or that LSD <i>causes</i> any number of other <i>effects</i>
which writers are so fond of describing, at most they seemed just
to add an additional link in the causal chain, as above. Observe,
however, the statements of some (<i>viz.,</i> ardent critics of
psychedelic research) that LSD <i>caused </i>psychosis, or a
schizophrenic-like state, or even suicide. Even court-cases,
criminal and civil, were resolved on the basis that psychedelic
drugs were a logical cause of various acts or behaviors, or even
instances of &quot;mental illness&quot;. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the press and other popular writing, several
accounts of hellish, or trivial experiences of an absurd nature
were published by those who considered themselves agnostics,
skeptics or clear-thinkers, attempting to minimize or ridicule
the sometimes mystical-sounding claims of those such as Aldous
Huxley, Gerald Heard, or Alan Watts. These debunking attempts
uniformly portrayed the results of the reporter's psychedelic
ingestion as a kind of Hollywood movie, as if the drug were some
roll of science-fiction film forcibly projected upon his
otherwise quite understandable and controllable life. &quot;The
drug made me do this, made me see that, caused me to think I was
a...&quot; etc. If someone had a negative experience, especially
if he were a noted reporter or medical practitioner, then his
report left no doubt whatsoever about what the cause was, where
the blame lay. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope that it is now becoming clear that
although the ingestion of a psychedelic drug may be the first
event of a series of events that culminates in undeniably
profound perceptual and psychological changes, the simplistic
designation of the first event as the logical cause of the entire
chain of following events makes no more sense than my saying that
psychedelic ingestion causes earthquakes. The mind-events of
psychedelic experience, I am suggesting, are in an important
sense just as &quot;exterior&quot; and coincidental to the
ingestion of the drug as was the earthquake I experienced on the
roof of my little bungalow in Guadalajara. It is my view that
attribution of cause and effect along these lines must be
abandoned completely, it is a misleading model of psychedelic
experience and must be replaced. Even the idea that a psychedelic
drug <i>causes</i> distortions of perception must be scrapped.
The whole idea of causation as it is currently conceived relative
to psychedelic experience is a metaphor, but unlike the model as
metaphor which is a useful device to understand and predict, the
metaphor in this case is an impediment to a clear understanding.
This is a major reason why the results of psychedelic research
have been so difficult to interpret, and also a reason why it was
so easy to criticize, even ridicule both the research and the
workers who produced it. </p>

    seven and a half years on the couch and over $20,000, and so

    LSD convinced me otherwise. </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As a first step in my replacement of the trivial
model of psychedelic experience, I am going to reverse the
situation at hand and ask, not what causes the psychedelic
experience, but rather what causes us to be in our
&quot;normal&quot; state of mind most, if not all of the time? We
might say that the brain in its normal neurochemical state is
sufficient cause. The champions of reductionism of course
maintain that the mind and its experiences cannot be anything <i>but</i>
states of the brain's neurons; this is, of course, Francis
Crick's &quot;Astonishing Hypothesis&quot;. <a name="back11"></a><a
href="#footnote11">(11)</a> I, among more notable critics of such
strong reductive materialism, would call it (at best) a Premature
Hypothesis, considering the present rudimentary state of
scientific knowledge about the nervous system. If recent
criticisms and counter-arguments against the reductionist
position have been less astonishing, <a name="back12"></a><a
href="#footnote12">(12)</a> they <i>have</i> been more accurate
in illustrating present limitations in understanding causation at
and especially <i>across</i> the various hierarchical levels of
complexity between the physics and the biochemistry of neurons at
one extreme, and consciousness and mind at the highest levels of
organization. A few paragraphs illustrating the difficulties and
paradoxes of the concept causation might be in order, although
the topic is hotly debated and I will gain perhaps as many
critics as converts from my personal observations: </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If, (due to the ambiguity of causation when one
attempts to apply the concept across levels of description or
complexity), the neurochemical <i>state </i>of the brain is not
strictly and exclusively a <i>cause </i>either of normal or
extranormal states of mind, this is of course not to deny that
there are <i>correspondences</i> between brain processes
involving neurons, cognitive processes involving systems of brain
parts, and conscious experience involving the total organism. Nor
is it to deny the possibility of learning things about one level
from studying another. It is the attribution of causation of
events between one level of this hierarchy and another which is
fraught with difficulties. Processes at one level are simply not
strictly reducible to processes at another, in spite of their
mutual interdependence. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The distinction here is important, if seemingly
paradoxical, and may possibly be understood better by the
observation that two entirely different cognitive processes
arriving at two entirely different &quot;states of mind&quot;,
must have the potential to occur from <i>exactly the same </i>original
neurochemical state of the brain. Stated a little differently:
exhaustive examination and description of a given brain state or
series of brain states (if it were possible) cannot <i>in
principle</i> predict the overall conscious experience of the
owner of that brain. Conversely, two different dynamic brain
states might well have the possibility of corresponding to the
same conscious experience. If these considerations were not the
case, free will would necessarily be an illusion and absolute
determinism unavoidable; only the extreme fringe of philosophy
seriously believes this to be the true state of mankind. <a
name="back13"></a><a href="#footnote13">(13)</a> Absolute
determinism is, of course, the position that everyone, all the
time, is determined by antecedent, irresistible physical
conditions, so that free will becomes as meaningless as the idea
that my computer screen might suddenly decide to exhibit a
&quot;P&quot; when I tap &quot;Q&quot; on the keyboard. Although
computers in good repair normally mind their P's and Q's,
consciousness does not. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I see the error of attribution of causation
concerning psychedelics as representative of the same error on
the larger scale of the whole question of mind-brain
relationships. In most current models of consciousness, of which
there recently have been many, there seems to me a fundamental
ignorance of the logical repercussions of saying, for instance,
that the mind, or consciousness, must be <i>caused</i> by the
brain. John Searle, the author of one of the more cautious and
measured treatises on consciousness <a name="back14"></a><a
href="#footnote14">(14)</a> nevertheless writes, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is an amazing fact that everything in our conscious
    life, from feeling pains, tickles, and itches to&#151;pick
    your favorite&#151;feeling the angst of postindustrial man
    under late capitalism or experiencing the ecstasy of skiing
    in deep powder&#151;is caused by brain processes. As far as
    we know the relevant processes take place at the micro levels
    of synapses, neurons, neuron columns, and cell assemblies.
    All of our conscious life is caused by these lower-level
    processes, but we have only the foggiest idea of how it all
    works. <a name="back15"></a><a href="#footnote15">(15)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Searle suggests that objections to brain-to-mind
causation result from a &quot;flawed conception of
causation&quot;, and he attempts to split the concept in two:
event-causation (a causal relation &quot;between discrete events
ordered sequentially in time&quot;), and non-event causation
which he illustrates with the example of the collective
properties of the molecules of a table &quot;causing&quot; its
apparent solidity. But I would suggest that these two concepts of
causation are so radically opposed in their meaning and
properties, perhaps being logically mutually exclusive, that it
would at a minimum be best to avoid using the same term for both
processes. Event-causation rests comfortably within the same
level of description, whereas Searle's non-event causation
violates that comfort. If non-event causation is called instead
&quot;facilitation&quot;, suggesting that in such a process there
are entities and aspects which arise mutually rather than depend
causally upon each other, we may lose the security of believing
that we know something of the underlying mechanisms of mind-brain
relationships, but gain a more pragmatic basis for further
understanding. Let us view a collection of wood molecules as
&quot;allowing&quot; or &quot;facilitating&quot; the properties
we recognize as &quot;table&quot;, in the same sense that a
valley allows or facilitates the flowing of a river through it:
in neither case is causation meaningful if we wish this term to
retain any concrete usefulness. Does the valley cause the river?
(Actually, the river has caused the valley through the process of
erosion!) Yet without the valley: no river! Without the
molecules: no table! The table was &quot;caused&quot; by the <i>menuisier</i>
who built it: to use the same term in the attempt to see how
properties arise mutually with the object or process which
manifest those properties only confuses. Causation would
logically have to operate bi-directionally in such instances, and
thus lose its meaning entirely. Again, it is clear that
attempting to apply the concept of causation across different
levels of description becomes paradoxical at best. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Quite obviously the point of view that brain
causes mind arises from that argument of poverty, &quot;well what
else could it be?&quot; (In other words, &quot;don't bring any
mystical entities into this discussion or I will dismiss your
view as unscientific&quot;). But if brain <i>causes</i> mind or
consciousness, and we are to understand causation in a reasonably
logical and precise way, then mind and consciousness are
superfluous and inoperative constructs. The two theorems of
causation we must agree to are: a cause must precede its effect
in time, however briefly, and, because the brain is composed of
discrete, non-infinitesimal components, a cause brought about by
brain processes may likewise not be infinitesimal, or
differential, it must have duration and other measurable
characteristics. From here it follows that if mind is caused by
the brain, and only by the brain, it may have no properties in
and of itself. It is reduced to the status of a gargoyle, or legs
on a snake. If brain states <i>cause </i>mental states in
exclusivity, then consciousness and mind can have no part in
causation whatever, since whatever is proposed as an effect of
mind must actually be the result of prior causation by the brain.
And according to the great philosophers of both past and present,
the whole point of mind/consciousness is that it most definitely
does have the power of causation. In a non-trivial sense then, it
appears at least as valid to say that mind causes brain as to say
the reverse, a paradoxical result to be sure. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So we see that across the various hierarchical
levels between the physics and chemistry of neurons of the brain
and the human mind, it is very difficult if not impossible to
attribute clear-cut principles of causation. <b>Causation seems
to enter the picture at each and every hierarchical level, and is
not wholly reducible to prior causation at another level of
organization.</b> About all that can be said with confidence at
this point is that brain and mind facilitate and reflect each
other, like the valley and the river, but in no logical sense do
they cause each other; that they are parallel processes, and for
an analogue of this seemingly paradoxical statement I would
compare the mind-brain duality to particle-wave duality in
quantum mechanics. The wave attributes of electromagnetic
radiation do not <i>cause </i>the particle attributes, nor <i>vice
versa.</i> The two contradictory and mutually exclusive
properties always accompany each other, and whether the one is
observed or the other depends entirely on one's point of view, <i>i.e.</i>,
the experiment one performs. Once again we see the importance of <i>point
of view,</i> or levels of description. Attribution of causation
between levels is inherently meaningless. This is so far a very
rudimentary model, I admit, and gives little help for forming
testable hypotheses. But we should not feel there is some cosmic
guarantee that we <i>can</i> devise an understandable model in
this case. There is, after all, some paradox in the using of mind
to understand mind, and we should expect some limitations. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus the argument that the normal brain causes
normal mind, or that psychedelics cause expanded mind or
consciousness, are both fallacious explanations. Nevertheless, we
can, and have found changes in neural signaling in the brain
which are <i>caused</i>, in the classical sense, by the
psychedelic drugs. If we can combine the facts of these changes
with the vastly improved (yet still very rudimentary) knowledge
we now have of the sequential, parallel, and cybernetic cognitive
processes that occur in the various brain systems under a wide
range of conditions, and test the resulting overall model of
neural signaling against an improved cognitive or psychological
model of the psychedelic state of mind, a new theory may be in
the making. To restate some of the essentials of this theory: it
will have to be a theory of processes, parallel processes that
are complimentary ways of understanding an overall aspect of
reality, of processes of cybernetic control and feedback, of
processes in which classical cause and effect may be at best a
blurred and uncertain property. If it is objected that
inapplicability of cause and effect seems unreasonable, remember
that physics had to confront the same kind of paradoxes earlier
in this century, and succeeded admirably. There is good reason to
believe that theories of the ultimate structure of mind and
consciousness will be no less and probably more mired in apparent
paradox than theories of the ultimate structure of matter and
energy.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But I am getting ahead of myself. As for my
theory, or any theory, being a good explanation of consciousness
or mind, no author should dare such a claim today. A woven web of
guesses with a very imprecise weave would be a big claim. I shall
deal with the implications of my theory for mind, or Mind, only
near the end of this exposition, and only as sheer speculation.
Let me first deal with the cognitive and psychological models of
the psychedelic experience, for these were the aspects that I
first explored, and it was through the construction and testing
of these models that I was able to devise models of neurological
functioning which could explain the cognitive processes that I
had observed. Now the cognitive model I am going to describe will
be for the moment a &quot;naked model&quot; having no structure
to support it, and since the model will be a radical departure,
in some ways, from the way we currently believe our cognitive
processes to operate, it will be easy for the reader to dismiss
it. Bear with me as the pieces of the puzzle fall into place
around the chosen starting point. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Remember that above I asked that the first
consideration should be: &quot;let us think of the effect of a
psychedelic drug as eliminative, rather than additive: the drug
functions as a facilitator of inherent processes, a substance
which by its neurological action <i>allows or assists</i> certain
processes to occur which might otherwise be rare or
improbable.&quot; I also mentioned above that the psychedelic
experience seems to provide a certain freedom from habits of
thinking, it almost ensures that one is more sensitive to one's
own prejudicial ways of seeing, hearing, perceiving, acting, and
most importantly, feeling, reasoning and deciding. So far I have
used the term &quot;thinking&quot; (as in habits of thinking),
rather imprecisely, including within its domain all sorts of
mental processes. I will presently re-define thinking to denote
two distinct categories of mental processes, the first
pre-conscious and largely automatic, the second comprising the
processes we normally think of (!) as thinking: reasoning and
deciding, for example. The necessity to provide some careful
definitions is evident simply from the number of ways I have used
&quot;think&quot; in this introductory paragraph, as well as the
obvious overlapping of meaning with other terms. Starting with
the common usage and understanding of such terms therefore, I
will try to provide more precise and functional meanings as I go
along. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Considering the power of psychedelic experience
to repress in some way, or at least make one more aware of habits
of thinking as they happen, I am unavoidably led to the idea that
such habits are a far more important factor in the normal
operation of the brain/mind then has been supposed. But for a
long time, something (perhaps the Behaviorist legacy that I
mentioned previously), seems to have stifled not only the study
of consciousness but also the pursuit of any technical
understanding of what a habit is, psychologically and
neurologically. The word &quot;habit&quot; is used only
non-technically in the literature, with few exceptions, since the
time of William James. But it seems to me that a habit, and there
is no denying that we &quot;have&quot; habits galore, must
consist of something more definable, more describable
technically, the concept must have a more heuristic value than
merely leaving the term to fend for itself in popular use. <a
name="back16"></a><a href="#footnote16">(16)</a> A habit, or as I
will now call them, <i>Habit Routines</i>, must be something very
much like a memory, <a name="back17"></a><a href="#footnote17">(17)</a>
but different from a memory in that it is routinely and
automatically retrieved and employed without any awareness of its
presence or effect. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In looking for a possible site for the storage
of habit routines, analogous to the idea of memory storage, it
occurred to me that probably the &quot;data&quot; <a
name="back18"></a><a href="#footnote18">(18)</a> of memory and
the data of habit routine was the same data, but that it was
accessed in different ways, perhaps by different systems in the
brain. When a memory is accessed, either intentionally or by some
random cue, what pops into awareness is a scene, a representation
in the various sense domains of a specific and time-delimited
event or series of events. We have a memory <i>of</i> some
specific and bounded fragment of the past, although one memory
may then cue another representing another period of time
altogether. I call this access of memory, <i>Logical Memory
Access</i>, or LMA. It is logical in that the specific
characteristics of the memory, the various informational
fragments from each sensory modality which are accessed, are
related in time and place and represent a sequence of events as
they appear to have happened. <a name="back19"></a><a
href="#footnote19">(19)</a> </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When a <i>habit routine </i>is called up for
use, a process I call <i>Habit Routine Search</i>, or HRS, the
elements of the routine do not seem to be bound by the same time
and place considerations: they may represent fragments of data
that were recorded at many different times and situations, but
with one or more defining parameters relevant to dealing with the
situation for which the habit routine has been summoned. LMA and
HRS are therefore two different means of accessing the data of
long-term memory for two different cognitive results. LMA yields
a tangible memory, HRS yields an unconscious evaluation pattern. <a
name="back20"></a><a href="#footnote20">(20)</a> </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I may now advance the hypothesis that the habit
routine search is a constant and primary process of cognitive
activity of the mind/brain, and furthermore that it is the main
and essential, underlying and pre-conscious process in the
activity we know as <i>thinking</i>. This part of thinking, (let
us call it thinking1), I will define as the unconscious
associational and evaluative process including habit routine
search which precedes, by just that fraction of a second, the
awareness of what is thought through the use of language or other
representational modalities such as the imagination and
manipulation of visual scenes, the use of gestures, the creation
of music and art; these processes are called symbolization. <a
name="back21"></a><a href="#footnote21">(21)</a> And since the
mind/brain is cybernetic, current sensory or environmental input
must always include or be mixed with input from trains of thought
leading to the instant we are experiencing. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus the determining parameters for HRS consist
of the environmental moment (the total sensory input), plus
ongoing feedback generated by conscious reaction to the current
habit routine that has already been generated. We can use the
term &quot;thinking2&quot; to denote and include all those
secondary processes we would normally call thinking, including
symbolization, checking and logical analysis, reasoning, decision
and feedback of instructions or modifying parameters to ongoing
thinking1. Thinking2 has the properties that some would label as
consciousness, but I would, at least for the moment, like to
avoid using the word, if only to simplify my descriptive task. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The feedback of instructions and parameters to
ongoing thinking1 probably uses what is now called working
memory, a short-term limited-capacity memory buffer or store
which is the subject of much contemporary research and debate.
There are apparently several aspects or domains of working
memory: one or more short term stores for spatial and visual
information, another for auditory information, perhaps divided
between speech-based and musical functions, and perhaps working
memory stores for combinations of sensory and cognitive data as
well. I will have more to say on working memory, its various
aspects and functions, and possible brain sites for its operation
in the next couple of chapters. For the moment I will hypothesize
an &quot;information&quot; storage site in the brain which holds
instructions provided by one set of thinking functions
(thinking2), for the execution of another set of thinking
functions (thinking1) which provide the raw material for the
process as a whole. Thus the habit routine search of thinking1 in
the data of long-term memory is modified and guided by
instructions from the decisions of thinking2 held in working
memory. These decisions may be deliberate, or largely automatic
yet available for introspection. Figure 1 represents a simple
flow chart of the processes described. </p>

<p> FIGURE 1. Flow Chart of Cognitive Processes.
ENV=Environmental moment, all sensory input at the given moment.
HRS=Habit Routine Search function, projects ENV into LTM and
retrieves the Habit Routine. LTM=Long Term Memory. HR+S=Assembled
habit routine plus selected Sensory information.
ACTION=implementation of habit routine in physical action or
approval of cognitive disposition; may be rejected in
&quot;SW&quot;, switch controlled by conscious decision. The
HABIT ROUTINE is both a template containing relevant sensory data
from ENV, and at the same time a prefabricated plan for reaction
to ENV and its WM (Working Memory) input. HR+S is delivered to
Thinking2 for Checking, Analysis, Attention, to which
Symbolization resonates. These conscious processes are then used
for Decision to accept or reject the habit routine and optionally
provide input parameters via WM affecting further HRS.
Thinking1=unconscious processes not available directly to
introspection. Thinking2=conscious processes, but may be
automatic and unattended unless Attention is active. Decision
based on either unattended processes, or processes scrutinized
with Attention and/or Symbolization. Decision may accept, reject,
supply parameters, and request further HRS. Decide has a
double-headed arrow back to other thinking2 activities to
indicate that there are cycles of thinking2 processes possible
before deciding then alters ongoing thinking1 processes. Checking
and Analysis are merely representative of all such functions
which could be said to consciously deal with ongoing cognition,
Reasoning, Calculation, etc., could also be included. Checking,
Analysis, Attention, and Symbolization could be said to
constitute components of Perception or Awareness. Note that the
process of LMA is omitted for the present. </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To restate the model then, thinking1 is the
overall automatic and unconscious process of the comparison of
current sensory input plus the result of previous symbolization,
checking and decision, (thinking2), with information stored in
long-term memory accessed through the process of <i>habit routine
search</i>. We are not normally aware of the thinking1 processes
at all. Decision, which may be active or passive, (and is mostly
the latter), is consequently fed back into the thinking1/HRS
process as an additional defining parameter for ongoing HRS. It
may also act as a switch nullifying the implicit actions
recommended by the ongoing habit routine. This is probably a very
arbitrary and primitive attempt to formulate a schematic flow
model of some of the overall ongoing everyday processes of the
human mind. And it certainly, along with all other possible
models, must be a great over-simplification. But let us just take
it as a first faltering step in the direction we think
(thinking2!) we want to go in our understanding of psychedelic
experience. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Let me illustrate the above proposed processes
with a short cognitive story, the kind of scene that happens to
us all quite frequently, but which passes with little recognition
of just what is taking place. I live in the mountains in an area
that has seen rural subsistence farming for a thousand or more
years. During this long period, the mountainside has been divided
and maintained into flat cultivable strips separated by rock
walls put together with no mortar, but a lot of care.
Nevertheless, with every prolonged period of rain, the earth
swells and a piece of wall somewhere is bound to collapse,
needing repair. Occasionally, a rock or two will get rolling and
wind up several terraces away from the point of collapse. Thus in
my walks around the property, it is common enough to see a grey
irregularly-shaped stone, or several, in the midst of the
pathway, even when no immediate point of wall damage is evident. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Recently, walking down to the garden, in a mood
of simply passively enjoying the walk, thinking not really about
any particular topic, perhaps on the border of that state known
as day-dreaming, nothing out of the ordinary seems to be
happening when... </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; According to my cognitive model above, we could
say that as I am walking, thinking1 is doing its normal,
unconscious and pre-emptive job of actively using all sensory
input to compare the current ongoing activity of my walk with all
that I have learned and experienced, stored in long-term memory.
The component process of thinking1, HRS, is constantly retrieving
the simplest, most readily available, most easily employable
habit routines which match the parameters defined by the totality
of sensory environmental input and my pre-organized intention
(walking down to the garden), and these habit routines are then
supplied, firstly, as templates for the automatic regulation of
all ongoing process including the perception and reaction to the
surroundings. Secondly, the habit routine, along with relevant
fragments of the sensory data itself, is supplied to thinking2,
which at this moment of daydreaming, is doing very little
analyzing, reasoning, or deciding about the surroundings. The
component process of thinking2, symbolization, is however
representing the sensory data (most of which is merely the
information of the current habit routine) and making it available
for awareness, so that I &quot;see, hear, smell, feel,
enjoy...&quot; (and perhaps even explain to myself in language:
the mountains are nice today!) my entire surroundings, although I
pay no special attention to anything in particular. There is even
an ongoing, if vague internal dialog occurring, partly about the
surroundings, but also about other matters entirely. This I am
not particularly paying attention to either. Thinking2 is
relaxing, simply passively &quot;enjoying&quot; the stroll.
Unless thinking1 gives some extraordinary signal that something
is amiss, or unusual, thinking2 is quite content to let thinking1
supply all interpretations and responses to ongoing activity
(action). Thinking2 is therefore interfering minimally, if at
all, in the thinking1 processes through the prerogatives of
reasoning and deciding feedback via working memory. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ...when suddenly, I spy a grey rock in the
pathway ahead. As I said, this is not an unusual occurrence, but
since I have not seen a rock at this spot previously, thinking2
goes into action, prodded by the novelty signaled by thinking1,
and &quot;notices&quot; the novelty and reviews (checking) the
actions of thinking1 which has presented the habit routine that,
there before me, just like several times in the past, lies a rock
that has rolled down from some wall up above. This is a habit
routine of interpretation of environmental data (ENV) and carries
the action recommendation to accept the novel object as
&quot;grey rock&quot;. The cognitive processes begin to operate
fast and furiously now, even though this is no emergency, just a
minor novelty. Fleetingly I am aware of the analytical checking
process in thinking2 that indicates, yes, it rained quite heavily
last week, <a name="back22"></a><a href="#footnote22">(22)</a> so
here is the result. Another thread of checking goes on, seemingly
at the same time, which finds the information that there is a
wall, two or three terraces up from this point, that is known to
be in poor repair and likely to have collapsed. I am aware that
somehow this analysis happens at lightning speed, almost
instantaneously, and that the symbolization in language with
which I can &quot;explain&quot; these positive checks on the
habit routine comes slightly after the fact, perhaps after the
checking process has already told thinking1 that its habit
routine is acceptable, proceed with normal operation. Thus the
checking and deciding function in thinking2 seems to be
independent, and faster than the symbolization of thinking2 which
seems only to resonate to the former operation. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am just about to approve the habit routine as
an accurate and true representation of the novelty which lies
before me when, and this happens so quickly as to be almost
simultaneous with all that has been so far described, something
seems amiss. Perhaps the color was slightly wrong, or perhaps I
detected some movement in the object, but with a sudden suspicion
like that which one feels when one realizes he has been lied to,
thinking2 sends out a strong command to thinking1 (the classic
double-take!): suspicious interpretation! Find alternate habit
routine! These commands also occur well before any symbolization
process can &quot;explain&quot; what is going on. And lo and
behold, with this extra prodding and data, the HRS comes up with
the more accurate suggestion that here lies a dirty, partially
crumpled plastic bag from the local supermarket. This habit
routine was probably one of several more that could be called up,
in a series of increasing complexity and unlikelihood, and
indeed, if the bag had been red, rather than dirty white (almost
grey), the &quot;plastic bag&quot; interpretation would have been
the first accessed, being the most likely given the ENV parameter
of the color red. (All the rocks here are grey.) <a name="back23"></a><a
href="#footnote23">(23)</a> An interesting after-effect occurs
here: I notice that during the next few moments I can view the
object and willfully transpose its identity back to that of grey
stone, but this ability fades and finally I am unable to
interpret the object as anything but plastic bag. The dependence
of perceived reality upon preconceptions, <i>i.e.</i>, habit
routines, is especially demonstrated by this residual if fleeting
ability to see the object as either interpretation. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now if it takes the above amount of words to
analytically describe what occurred in probably a half-second, my
statement that there are limitations in using the mind to explain
mind takes on some relevance. And the above is certainly an
oversimplification! For instance, I believe that thinking1 and
HRS can be multitasking, to use a computer analogy. Thinking1 and
associated HRS can be interpreting the ongoing activity as
described above, and simultaneously be working on another thread
of material in reference to my internal dialog, which I mention
above as possibly being about something completely different than
my walk. I can be actively talking to myself about some subject
in which I have many severe prejudices (which are being accessed
as habit routines by thinking1), all the while noticing grey
rocks, plastic bags, or whatever, which also require the HRS
system to interpret. Whether the two threads are simultaneous or
&quot;time-sharing&quot;, I would not yet care to say. As for
even further aspects of complexity, I have also made no mention
yet of how the factors of significance or value are attached to
the sensory data accompanying a habit routine. More on this
later. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Let me postpone further theoretical
considerations for a bit to consider how the psychedelic
experience fits with the hypotheses presented so far. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>The function of a psychedelic drug, according
to my theory, is to interfere in some way with the Habit Routine
Search function of the brain, and I will call this the Habit
Suspension Model of the effect of psychedelic drugs</b>. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Since the habit routine search mechanism has
very probably several functional neural pathways and brain parts
which support its operation, different psychedelic drugs may
affect the system by differing mechanisms yet yield very similar
overall results. All further supposed effects of the ingestion of
these substances are not direct effects of the drugs themselves,
but rather are consequences, which very probably are <i>perpetuated
and magnified</i> by cybernetic mechanisms, of the changes
brought about in the HRS system of the brain. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now I do not mean to imply that habit routines
are destroyed by the influence of psychedelics, or that the
habits are completely suppressed or inaccessible during the time
of drug influence. It is much more a process of <i>temporary
delay</i> or <i>change in significance and value </i>of habit
routines and their consequently changed use in ongoing cognitive
processes. The strength of the effect seems dose-dependent. The
habit routines seem to arrive slightly out of phase, if I may be
allowed an electromagnetic analogy, and presented thusly to
thinking2 do not seem correct or valid recommendations for
ensuing evaluation and decision. And it is the habit routines
used for perception, analysis, reasoning and symbolization (I
will call them the cognitive habit routines) <a name="back24"></a><a
href="#footnote24">(24)</a> that are primarily affected: habit
routines which are used to coordinate movement, such as walking
or manipulating objects, are only slightly affected, if at all.
Unlike alcohol or some other drugs, even high doses of
psychedelics have very minimal effects on physical coordination.
As Huxley noted on his first mescaline experience: although he
wondered, when it was suggested that he take a walk in the
garden, whether he would be physically able to leave his chair,
once launchedinto the act he noticed no difficulty or change in
coordination. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now we may state something about the
&quot;causes&quot; of the normal state of mind and the
psychedelic state: the normal state of mind is facilitated by the
constant process of HRS which finds appropriate,
personality-typical responses for all ongoing activity. A
&quot;response&quot; may be an interpretation or complex
perception, an attitude, an emotional reaction, a
&quot;prejudice&quot;, or a pilot for actual physical action.
These responses are habit routines representing the summed
totality of ways in which similar situations were dealt with in
the past, and these habit routines are presented to thinking2 as
pre-structured ways of perceiving and dealing with the ongoing
situation so as to minimize or practically eliminate the
necessity for thinking2 to doubt perception or alter the response
through analytical decision making. Unless thinking2 is signaled
of some unusual significance that warrants attention, it may not
even become aware of the decisions made on its behalf by
thinking1. The process is cybernetic, an endless loop of
causation, a<i> </i>process which, after a small delay, <i>may </i>enter
consciousness as language and other reflective activities in the
process defined as symbolization. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The normal delivery of HR's by the HRS mechanism
for use in ongoing cognitive activity <i>is</i> precisely what we
call a normal state of mind, a state in which the checking
ability and analysis of thinking2 does or needs to do very
little. A good analogy would be driving along a well-known road
in light traffic: practically all required actions are
automatically provided for without conscious effort or the need
for evaluation by the analysis and checking of thinking2. This
applies to all physical routines needed to steer, brake, etc.,
but more importantly to the routines of perception, judgment, and
planning needed to decide, for example, whether the child ahead
is probably going to ride his bike too close for safety. Although
everyone would accept the analogy, I will perhaps not make many
friends suggesting that the totality of life is also a simple
matter of habit routines (sometimes of somewhat greater
complexity than those dealing with highway driving!), separated
at infrequent intervals by brief bursts of creativity which may
be little more than responses to temporary emergencies.
Psychology textbooks may be full of research showing how
automatic most actions and thoughts really are, but the reader
automatically (!) takes the position that the description is
relevant to others, the objects of study, and certainly not to
him who is right then scrutinizing the phenomenon. We may deduce,
perhaps, that a very powerful habit routine is the one which
gives us the impression of being constantly and fully aware, in
an analytic, deciding, and creative sense, of our surroundings
and thought processes, that habits play only a minor,
inconsequential and optional role in thinking. <a name="back25"></a><a
href="#footnote25">(25)</a> Again, the psychology textbooks are
filled with studies which indicate the contrary. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For the moment I must postpone showing the
distinction between physical habit routines on the one hand, (as
for example the physical, learned routines employed in the actual
driving of the car, above), and perceptual and cognitive habit
routines on the other. For now, we could say that cognitive habit
routines, among their other functions, may constitute a pilot for
the selection and implementation of <i>motor routines</i> used to
guide and control actual physical movement. I believe that two
quite independent systems of the brain are used to store and
implement the instructions for these activities. This would
explain why, according to my model as well as experimental
observations, cognitive and perceptual habit routines are
strongly affected by psychedelics, but physical coordination is
practically untouched. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>It is the normal and pre-emptive operation of
the HRS mechanism which is the impediment preventing the normal
mind from interpreting sensory and feedback input as anything but
common, routine, normal, everyday input.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We are very much the slaves of the habit routine
mechanism, and this is to be expected from an evolutionary
standpoint. HRS is the mechanism all organisms having even
moderately developed nervous systems use to deal with any and all
situations which do not present a crisis, situations of normal
significance and value for ongoing existence. The habit routine
is a short-cut, a pre-established pattern allowing an organism to
comprehend and deal with commonly encountered situations quickly
and with a very minimum of neurological, cognitive effort. More
primitive animals with very little cognitive ability in reserve
must rely strongly upon the HRS system. The habit routine
mechanism was probably a very early evolutionary development in
the animal kingdom for it would have conferred obvious important
advantages over any animal which had to treat every single event
as unique, an animal which would not gain the benefits of
practice and learning about a wide range of everyday situations.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us now review the list of
&quot;effects&quot; outlined earlier and see how they can be
understood in terms of the Habit Suspension Model. As an
introduction to the phenomenology of ASCs, I asked, &quot;let us
see if we can understand each 'effect' not as something that a
psychedelic drug <i>does</i>, but as something which <i>we</i>
might do, if only rarely, under certain circumstances.&quot;
Pretend, for the moment, that you have never even heard of
psychedelic drugs. This may not be easy, but for someone with
some measure of practiced control over his habit routines, in
reading the list, I think it would be quite normal to be able to
say, &quot;Yes, I've experienced something like that&quot;, or at
least admit that someone they know had had similar experiences.
In short, the only thing that makes any of the categories awesome
or strange, is their purported causal connection with psychedelic
drugs. Take the famous alleged time-distorting power of
psychedelic drugs. If you were having a very busy and interesting
afternoon with your favorite hobby, you might look up at the
clock and remark, &quot;holy cow, five-thirty <i>already!</i>&quot;.
But if you heard from some tabloid-reported source that LSD made
you feel it was only about four o'clock when actually it was
five-thirty... (or <i>vice versa</i> ). </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I think it is obvious that we have habit
routines for dealing with the everyday perception of the passage
of time, so that when we look at a clock, it is really only to
confirm what we already sense about the time of day. If you look
at your watch, and it has stopped even twenty minutes previous,
something seems immediately wrong unless you are particularly
distracted with other tasks. Even upon awakening from a deep
sleep in the middle of the night, I quite often find that I know
the time to the nearest ten minutes, in spite of living far out
in the countryside away from hourly chimes or audible traffic
patterns. In the above case of intense absorption in some
activity, we have habit routines available such that <i>we expect
</i>it to actually be later than it feels, so that when we
express amazement that it's already five-thirty, the knowledge
that we have been busily engaged does more than a little to take
the edge off the amazement, so to speak. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; All this is common knowledge. But where my
theory begins, is in the attempt to describe the data and systems
by which this simple everyday process is implemented, and
drastically changed by various influences including psychedelic
drugs. The hypothesis that it is installed potential habit
routines that deal with everyday perception of time gains some
credibility from the knowledge that time perception was quite
different before the advent of widespread mechanical time-keeping
devices. In medieval Europe, daylight hours were longer or
shorter according to the season, somethingthat would probably
wreak havoc with our modern sense of time until we had long
practice installing the newly required habit routines to deal
with the situation. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My theory also departs from simple common
knowledge in its attribution of such fundamental importance to
the use of habit routine; rather than a habit being an occasional
type of response to certain situations, </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>it is now proposed that the habit routine
search is the principal operation in thinking1, always a
precedent to awareness and thinking2, and that the habit routine
presented to awareness for decision making <i>always </i>constitutes
the pre-emptive or default response, seldom overruled by the
active analysis and decision of thinking2 except in cases of
emergency or particularly unusual significance of events</b>. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Familiarity breeds indifference, as Aldous
Huxley noted, but the cognitive mechanism by which such an
aphorism might operate has until now never been proposed. All
situations for which a satisfactory habit routine may be summoned
are dealt with as automatically, and with as great a measure of
indifference, as possible. The artist, the great composer, the
creative genius in any field may succeed in seeing the
significant when presented with the merely routine, <a
name="back26"></a><a href="#footnote26">(26)</a> but this is not
the normal state of brain operation, nor is it the type of brain
operation that evolution has caused to be predominant. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And this is why psychedelic drugs appear to be
so overwhelmingly powerful. When awareness is effectively cut
loose from the normal and reliable flow of habit routine, <i>everything</i>
seems changed, odd, with unusual, sometimes overpowering, but not
immediately explainable changes in significance. And as I have
indicated, this very change is actively recycled and augmented by
cybernetic feedback wherein current evaluation and checking of
awareness is fed back into the stream of thinking1 which is
seeking out further habit routines, now including parameters
which instruct it to look for the unusual, and these new habit
routines themselves are then delayed, suspended, or changed in
significance. Item C in the phenomenology of ASC's, the sense or
fear of loss of control, can be easily understood from the
foregoing. An individual's reality, what he automatically
believes to be normal and true in his estimation of the world
around him, is entirely a matter of the habit routines he has
collected, and himself installed, whether by intentional or
unconscious practice. If the individual is not prepared to
surrender his cherished notions, if he cannot overcome the
obvious implication that reality, seen without the aid of
preconceived habit routines, must appear <i>relative</i> and not
absolute, feelings of loss of control are the naive
interpretation to be expected. (And of course, the lesson being
taught is, &quot;What control?&quot;) </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As for the other items listed previously as
&quot;effects&quot; of psychedelic drugs, it should not now be
difficult to see how they are all the result of an individual's
having reduced access to his habit routines which define how he
sees, thinks, perceives objects around him, perceives his own
body and state of mind, the meaning and significance he attaches
to otherwise ordinary thoughts and perceptions, and so on.
So-called perceptual distortions are merely ordinary perception
divorced from the normal pre-emptive preconditioning of the habit
routine complex through which such perceptions are symbolized. To
those who wish to believe that psychedelic drugs cause
hallucinations and bizarre perceptual effects, the proposal that
perception under the influence of the psychedelic experience is
in fact closer to actual reality than normal perception (which is
heavily &quot;distorted&quot; by our habit routines) will appear
absurd. But the &quot;habit of thinking&quot; (as in Margolis'
analysis, see footnote 16) which prevents a paradigm shift
necessary to understand the psychedelic experience may well be
just this: the whole of our experience has established the
conviction, in reality a lie, that what we perceive is
automatically and without doubt, reality. Although most current
theories in psychology recognize the lie, as individuals we still
carry on as if this were a mere scientific technicality which
appears in certain laboratory experiments. The example
illustrated by the grey stone anecdote shows how misinformed we
are in this conviction. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of the items in the phenomenology of ASC's
may be understood as secondary or cascade effects of the more
primary results of suspended habit routine: hypersuggestibility
might be interpreted as a result of the feelings of loss of
control, sense of ineffability, and change of significance
wherein the suggestions of the guide or researcher are given
greater weight in the vacuum of normal comprehension of ongoing
cognition. Change in emotional expression would likewise be a
secondary effect derived from perceived alterations in thinking,
feeling of loss of control, etc. The suspension of the normal
framework of habit routine for interpreting and symbolizing
ongoing experience should obviously result in the sense of
ineffability. Feelings of rejuvenation may result from suspension
of personality habit routines that have become contradictory or
self-destructive, their temporary suspension leading the
individual to realize that they are mere routines, and capable of
being reformed once seen for what they are. Here we are led to
the hypothesis that the personality itself can be understood as a
malleable and alterable collection of habit routines; some early
psychedelic research suggested as much, and made use of the idea
by successfully treating many personality disorders with
psychedelic therapy. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed, the very existence of what we call
&quot;personality&quot; as such a strong, pervasive property of a
human being argues for the prevalence, importance, and
predominance of habit routines and the HRS as the primary
cognitive process. Personality, world view, beliefs, desires,
opinions, are all understandable as complex assemblies of habit
routines. What the Freudians have for so long called the
unconscious, may simply be the totality of potential habit
routines that can be accessed! <a name="back27"></a><a
href="#footnote27">(27)</a> A memory is not a memory until it is
accessed, therefore an unconscious memory is an oxymoron. But a
habit routine, (whose elements consist of the very same data), is
not only an unconscious potential pattern for perception,
comprehension, and behavior, it is in addition and quite
normally, accessed and employed unconsciously, and the process is
not available to introspection. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To return to the pathway for just a moment, from
my own personal experiences with psychedelic drugs, the grey
stone in question would probably have appeared, at first and very
briefly, as an object of some significance (it was new to its
location) but <i>without</i> an habit routine to immediately
identify it. The first thing my thinking2 would sense would be
mystery, the object seen as an <i>unknown. </i>Very quickly
thereafter, I think it is common during psychedelic experience
for the HRS of thinking1 to present <i>multiple</i>
interpretations of the object (hence one or more interpretations
would logically have to be an &quot;hallucination&quot;); I might
have sensed two or more possible identifications at once,
whereupon the relativeness of its novelty and significance might
stimulate further fundamental changes in my interpretation, and
so on. As this process is cybernetic, it can quite run away with
itself, so to speak, and the ordinary become fantastic through
successive interpretations and alterations of meaning and
significance. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The multiple interpretations, the multiple habit
routines appearing simultaneously, might be the mechanism whereby
it has been noticed by researchers that psychedelic experience
can assist in the &quot;recovery and eliciting of vast quantities
of unconscious material.&quot; It is as if thinking2 is
signaling, in the absence of a dependable habit routine,
&quot;quick, send me all the habit routines you've got, there's a
big mystery going on here.&quot; And then the habit routines that
do arrive are also out of whack... (but also potentially very
revealing of the personality and the &quot;unconscious&quot;). At
this stage there is little to be done except to relax and observe
the process as it unfolds. It is instructive to the personality
to be shown how dependent it is on normal and perhaps quite
artificial automatisms, and it is instructive concerning the
underlying nature of reality to observe first hand how its
interpretation is also totally dependent on preconceived
structures of the mind which may be more or less arbitrary, if
not outright deception. If this be madness, schizophrenia,
psychosis, or folly, a moderate dose of it is certainly more than
a homeopathic remedy for the far greater sickness which quite
obviously afflicts modern man &quot;in this century of
holocaust.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To conclude this chapter, I will quote at length
another account of psychedelic experience and the
&quot;effects&quot; as noted by the experiencer. The narrative is
that of Aldous Huxley, probably the most famous and widely-read
account of psychedelic experience to date. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I took my pill at eleven. An hour and half later I was
    sitting in my study, looking intently at a small glass vase.
    The vase contained only three flowers&#151;a full-blown Belle
    of Portugal rose, shell pink with a hint at every petal's
    base of a hotter, flamier hue; a large magenta and
    cream-coloured carnation; and, pale purple at the end of its
    broken stalk, the bold heraldic blossom of an iris.
    Fortuitous and provisional, the little nosegay broke all the
    rules of traditional good taste. At breakfast that morning I
    had been struck by the lively dissonance of its colours. But
    that was no longer the point. I was not looking now at an
    unusual flower arrangement. I was seeing what Adam had seen
    on the morning of his creation - the miracle, moment by
    moment, of naked existence... [I was seeing] a bunch of
    flowers shining with their own inner light and all but
    quivering under the pressure of the significance with which
    they were charged...[And] the books, for example, with which
    my study walls were lined. Like the flowers, they glowed,
    when I looked at them, with brighter colours, a profounder
    significance. Red books, like rubies; emerald books; books
    bound in white jade; books of agate, of aquamarine, of yellow
    topaz; lapis Lazuli books whose colour was so intense, so
    intrinsically meaningful, that they seemed to be on the point
    of leaving the shelves to thrust themselves more insistently
    on my attention... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>At ordinary times the eye concerns itself with such
    problems as Where?&#151;How far?&#151;How situated in
    relation to what? In the mescalin experience the implied
    questions to which the eye responds are of another order.
    Place and distance cease to be of much interest. The mind
    does its perceiving in terms of intensity of existence,
    profundity of significance, relationships within a pattern...
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>From the books the investigator directed my attention to
    the furniture. A small typing-table stood in the centre of
    the room; beyond it, from my point of view, was a wicker
    chair and beyond that a desk. The three pieces formed an
    intricate pattern of horizontals, uprights and diagonals - a
    pattern all the more interesting for not being interpreted in
    terms of spatial relationships. Table, chair and desk came
    together in a composition that was like something by Braque
    or Juan Gris, a still life recognizably related to the
    objective world, but rendered without depth, without any
    attempt at photographic realism. I was looking at my
    furniture, not as the utilitarian who has to sit on chairs,
    to write at desks and tables, and not as the cameraman or
    scientific recorder, but as the pure aesthete whose concern
    is only with forms and their relationships within the field
    of vision or the picture space. But as I looked, this purely
    aesthetic Cubist's-eye view gave place to what I can only
    describe as the sacramental vision of reality. I was back
    where I had been when I was looking at the flowers&#151;back
    in a world where everything shone with the Inner Light and
    was infinite in its significance... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Mescalin raises all colours to a higher power and makes
    the percipient aware of innumerable fine shades of
    difference, to which, at ordinary times, he is completely
    blind... Visual impressions are greatly intensified and the
    eye recovers some of the perceptual innocence of childhood,
    when the sensum was not immediately and automatically
    subordinated to the concept. Interest in space is diminished
    and interest in time falls almost to zero... Though the
    intellect remains unimpaired and though perception is
    enormously improved, the will suffers a profound change for
    the worse. The mescalin taker sees no reason for doing
    anything in particular and finds most of the causes for
    which, at ordinary times, he was prepared to act and suffer,
    profoundly uninteresting. He can't be bothered with them, for
    the good reason that he has better things to think about... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'This is how one ought to see,' I kept saying as I looked
    down at my trousers, or glanced at the jewelled books in the
    shelves, at the legs of my infinitely more than Van-Goghian
    chair. 'This is how one ought to see, how things really
    are'... for the moment, mescalin had delivered me [from] the
    world of selves, of time, of moral judgments and utilitarian
    considerations, the world (and it was this aspect of human
    life which I wished, above all else, to forget) of
    self-assertion, of cocksuredness, of over-valued words and
    idolatrously worshipped notions... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>[T]he investigator suggested a walk in the garden. I was
    willing; and though my body seemed to have dissociated itself
    almost completely from my mind&#151;or, to be more accurate,
    though my awareness of the transfigured outer world was no
    longer accompanied by an awareness of my physical
    organism&#151;found myself able to get up, open the
    French-window and walk out with only a minimum of hesitation.
    It was odd, of course, to feel that 'I' was not the same as
    these arms and legs 'out there,' as this wholly objective
    trunk and neck and even head. It was odd; but one soon got
    used to it. And anyhow the body seemed perfectly well able to
    look after itself. In reality, of course, it always does look
    after itself. All that the conscious ego can do is to
    formulate wishes, which are then carried out by forces which
    it controls very little and understands not at all. When it
    does anything more&#151;when it tries too hard, for example,
    when it worries, when it becomes apprehensive about the
    future&#151;it lowers the effectiveness of those forces and
    may even cause the devitalized body to fall ill. In my
    present state, awareness was not referred to an ego; it was,
    so to speak, on its own. This meant that the physiological
    intelligence controlling the body was also on its own. For
    the moment that interfering neurotic who, in waking hours,
    tries to run the show was blessedly out of the way. <a
    name="back28"></a><a href="#footnote28">(28)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; What a wonderfully poetic way of describing the
normal collection of habit routines that rendered the world
ordinary, plain, of merely routine significance: Huxley calls his
habit-routine governed personality &quot;that interfering
neurotic who, in waking hours, tries to run the show.&quot; He
notes that his awareness &quot;was not referred to an ego&quot;,
i.e., that the habit routines ofpersonality that preserve
self-image, self-importance, selfness, were no longer available,
his awareness &quot;was, so to speak, on its own.&quot; And the
following line: &quot;All that the conscious ego can do is to
formulate wishes, which are then carried out by forces which it
controls very little and understands not at all,&quot; is nothing
but a poetic description of the operation of checking and
decision of thinking2 feeding back instructions as parameters for
further habit routine search operations via working memory. If we
do not control them, at least we may now understand them somewhat
better. And note the number of times that increased
&quot;significance&quot; is mentioned... </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>... for the moment, mescalin had delivered me [from] the
    world of selves, of time, of moral judgments and utilitarian
    considerations, the world (and it was this aspect of human
    life which I wished, above all else, to forget) of
    self-assertion, of cocksuredness, of over-valued words and
    idolatrously worshipped notions... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In a word, mescaline had delivered him from
habit routines. If the Habit Suspension Model of psychedelic
experience is correct, we may begin to see the enormous power of
the HRS mechanism to shape our every impression, our every word
and deed, for if the profound changes of psychedelic experience
are nothing but reduced access to acceptable habit routines, we
would have to say that habit routines are the cognitive water we
swim in, omnipresent and supportive of our every intellectual
movement, yet (until now) perfectly transparent and undetectable
to ordinary scrutiny. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At the risk of seeing habit routines everywhere,
for a new theory often incites such excesses in its newly
acquired adherents, I think it safe to say that most of the
&quot;effects&quot; noted by Mr. Huxley, and in the preceding
examples as well, can be adequately understood in terms of the
Habit Suspension Model. In Mr. Huxley's case, considering his
great personal interest in art, the Perennial Philosophy and
mystical and spiritual matters, his compassion for the human
situation, and his humility, the effects he describes demand such
an interpretation. </p>

<p> (17). When speaking of memory here, I refer to what is now
generally called &quot;long-term memory.&quot; <a href="#back17">(back)</a>
<a name="footnote18"></a> </p>

<p> (18). I enclose the word in quotes to denote my
dissatisfaction with the current computer-oriented models of much
of cognitive science. In using such words as data, information,
computation, etc. when speaking about mind and consciousness, one
does less of explaining than &quot;conjuring away the barriers
between man and machine, between consciousness and
mechanism.&quot; (Raymond Tallis in <i>Psycho-Electronics</i>).
But it is very difficult<i> not </i>to use such terms today, so
ingrained is the idea of some equivalence between mind and
machine. I hope that the reader will see that as my theory
develops, along with new ways to understand the important <i>differences</i>
between man and machine, the use of such terms will slowly be
replaced by new concepts which obviate their need. Thus I will
from this point in the text suspend the tediousness of quotation
marks provided the reader will keep in mind the limitations I
have expressed. <a href="#back18">(back)</a> <a name="footnote19"></a>
</p>

<p> (19). Recent terminology as well as theory in the field of
memory research has blossomed. The process of LMA which I define
here would be said to access <i>autobiographical </i>or <i>episodic
memory</i>; additionally there have been proposed the terms <i>procedural,
semantic, implicit and explicit, short-term, long-term, and
working memory</i> to describe other aspects of memory. I shall
define and use these terms as the model develops. <a
href="#back19">(back)</a> <a name="footnote20"></a> </p>

<p> (20). Perhaps an analogy would be helpful here. We might
think of a unit of memory as like a single frame of a motion
picture. In LMA, a sequence of frames is called up, and
experienced as a sequence or &quot;film clip,&quot; in temporal
order, and with conscious reference to the time and conditions
where the frames were recorded. This is not to say that the
process may not become degraded, with loss of data, loss of
reference to time and place, erroneous mixing of different
memories, etc., the ideal expressed merely illustrates the type
and mechanics of the process to be understood. HRS, however,
would access a variety of single frames recorded at different
times and places, a sort of collage of single frames, associated
not as a temporal sequence, and not consciouslyexperienced, but
unconsciously selected and employed according to a thematic
agenda specified by subject content corresponding to current
perception. Thus if stopped on the highway by a &quot;law
enforcement officer&quot; for no apparent reason, we may be
rather hurriedly accessing, in the data of all memories of
dealings with the police (our own and knowledge of such dealings
by others gleaned from friends, newspapers, etc.), for every
possible habit routine that might assist in estimating what is
going on. Specific memories of similar scenes might appear
fleetingly, but far more important would be the unconscious
evaluation patterns supplied by habit routine search that would
allow and assist our judgment to calculate just how to react to
any eventuality, given the particular parameters of the current
situation. Thus if he has just gotten off an excessively chromed
Harley, has black ray-bans, razor-sharp creases on his shirt and
a penetrating snarl we will automatically react somewhat
differently than if he was a school-crossing patrolman, tips his
hat and says he thinks our signal light might be out. No
deliberate calculation or access of actual memories via LMA is
necessary, yet the &quot;data&quot; of many memories is obviously
being employed, unconsciously and automatically, to guide our
reaction to the situation. <a href="#back20">(back)</a> <a
name="footnote21"></a> </p>

<p> (21). The model described here has parallels to ideas
suggested by C.H. van Rhijn, see &quot;Symbolysis: Psychotherapy
by Symbolic Presentation&quot; in <i>The Use of LSD in
Psychotherapy, </i>Harold A. Abramson, editor, Josiah Macy, Jr.
Foundation, 1960. <a href="#back21">(back)</a> <a
name="footnote22"></a> </p>

<p> (22). This process must also use a habit routine, thinking2
feeding instructions to thinking1 to search for justification
that its previous interpretation of &quot;grey rock ahead&quot;
is possible. A habit routine is then found which relates the
cause and effect pattern learned previously about rain and
out-of-place rocks. I do not specifically remember as memories
the rainy days and the displaced rocks encountered, but use only
&quot;frames&quot; of these memories to obtain the fact that rain
has recently occurred on a scale which is known from experience
to produce grey rocks in pathways. <a href="#back22">(back)</a> <a
name="footnote23"></a> </p>

<p> (23). This knowledge must also have been retrieved and used
through HRS as a parameter ensuring that a <i>grey </i>object be
interpreted as probably a stone, and an object of decidedly
non-grey hue as not-a-stone. <a href="#back23">(back)</a> <a
name="footnote24"></a> </p>

<p> (24). And here I think that we are dealing with two classes
of habit routines, some simple habit routines of perception are
probably called up by the arrangement of sensory environmental
data itself, <i>i.e., </i>in thinking1, whereas habit routines of
analysis and symbolization must be habit routines that are called
up by thinking1 on behalf of thinking2. I will therefore
sometimes refer to a <i>habit routine complex, </i>signifying a
composite habit routine comprising multiple aspects and multiple
interlocking recommendations for action. <a href="#back24">(back)</a>
<a name="footnote25"></a> </p>

<p> (25). This might be understood as a habit routine which
thinking2 installs in memory through the process of constantly
seeing its power to alter the surroundings. The habit routine is
that thinking2 is in control, while the reality is that, most of
the time, it is on vacation. <a href="#back25">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="footnote26"></a>(26). The question presents itself:
Who can be best trusted to decide what is, and what is not
routine, the creative genius or the bored assembly-line worker? <a
href="#back26">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="footnote27"></a>(27). Warning! The reaction to such
ideas must also be primarily a matter of habit routines
representing one's investment in previous theories. <a

<h2>4.&nbsp; The Neuromechanics of HRS &#151; Introduction </h2>
</center>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Being an outlaw does have its share of sudden
and tragic surprises. The moralist (if he has read this far, out
of a taste for voyeurism or some other vice curious to those who
know what is right and hesitate not to coerce others to their
views), shall now have permission to gloat. Yet it has been my
life experience that sudden misfortune occurs to us all, most
unexpectedly and just when we thought we were going along quite
nicely. Moralists and fanatics of all kinds get their share quite
as much as the outlaw, the iconoclast, or the revolutionary, but
moralists seem rarely to commit their misfortunes to pen and
paper. The worst of misfortunes that men suffer is in my view the
slow, life-long and silent tragedy of those who do not, or will
not abandon so-called security when opportunity knocks. To be
simply dragged along by the responsibility to safety may be
instinctual, but it is hardly creative nor does it lead to the
fulfillment of the more precious potentialities of being human.
To arrive safely at the stage of life where it is certain that
the halfway point has passed, yet not even have an interesting
story to tell, would be for me a far greater tragedy than the
several which awaited. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; During the later stages of our morning-glory
researches, news reached us that two friends, who had been
missing for a few days, had been ambushed and shot dead while on
an expedition into the mountains of Michoacan. Several times
previously they had brought back with them the most amazingly
potent cannabis for us to sample; in those days seedless
marijuana, or <i>sinsemilla</i>, was almost unknown. I remember
introducing <i>sinsemilla</i> from one of their mountain forays
to a few friends in New York who were well acquainted with all
the varieties of hashish and pot that international smuggling
could bring to market. With the exception of that rare piece of
especially strong Lebanese Red, the <i>sinsemilla</i> won all
contests. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In spite of the new climate of liberalism on
both coasts of America, for several marijuana smoke-ins had
occurred and were mostly tolerated (it even seemed like
legalization would not be too long in the offing), in Mexico
association with any aspect of marijuana classed one immediately
as a <i>contrabandista</i>, and subject to the same wild-west
outlaw-style of justice as any train robber, or trafficker of
guns, hard drugs, slaves, or revolution. The fate of our
mild-mannered hippie friends was adequate proof of this. A few
weeks previous, we had been invited to a luncheon in celebration
of I-was-never-certain-exactly-what, and around the great table
of Mexican haute-cuisine sat the chief of police of Guadalajara,
a couple of army generals charged with controlling, among other
things, the local drug traffic, a half-dozen other government
types, a whole tribe of the most authentic-looking <i>contrabandistas</i>
one could imagine, including the major marijuana and hard-drug
broker of the state of Jalisco, and three disguised hippies (we
had cut our hair short north of the border to ensure ease of
entry into Mexico). Well it was a merry time indeed, I am ashamed
that I had not then learned enough Spanish to relate here the
details of the merriment, but the machine guns were casually
reposing along the entire length of the dining room wall in a
manner surpassing even Hollywoodian depictions of 1920's Chicago.
We hippies, of course, came unarmed. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the JohnWayneian fables we had been
nourished on from early youth inured us to such signs of
impending catastrophe, but the loss of our friends suddenly
transformed the mythology of good guys <i>versus</i> bad guys
into a sobering lesson. It was not the type of sobriety the
moralist will now blame me for not embracing, for that is the
sobriety of capitulation to a lie, a lie which is not even one's
own. It was more the type of sobriety gained by the hard won
contest in which a small bit of wisdom is wrested from the ritual
of initiation which fate so generously supplies in response to
boldness. All the ancient tribes had structured their societies
with elaborate and demanding ritual contests whereby the young,
expressing their natural and new-found boldness, might gain
wisdom with minimal risk, but our own advanced Western society
had dispensed with such superstition, with the feeble exception
of First Communions and Bar Mitzvahs, and so the young found it
necessary to express prowess through automotive inanity,
alcoholic one-upmanship and other silly sport, the corporal and
spiritual fatalities of which seldom prompted scholars to bemoan
the demise of ancient ritual. If anything, new layers of laws and
regulations, and a few new prisons were expected to do the trick.
But I digress. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; What the tragedy prompted me to do was not beat
a penitent retreat from my errant ways, disobeying laws that were
written for my own good, but to remove to safer climes and
continue on my researches with redoubled enthusiasm. Since the
outlawing of all use of LSD in 1967, the predictable had
happened. Clandestine manufacture and distribution had flourished
as had bathtub gin several decades before, and parallel to
bathtub gin incidents, not all clandestine LSD was of good
quality, nor manufactured by those intending that its use be
accomplished intelligently. (And as for parallels between alcohol
and psychedelic drugs, this is as far as it goes: either, or
both, may be legal or illegal, used or abused.) As a chemist, it
seemed a worthwhile project to experiment with the various
published synthetic methods it was possible to use in the
manufacture of LSD and other psychedelics, in order to develop
the most efficient processes possible. Efficiency here would mean
that the process had to employ a minimum of equipment, easily
obtainable chemical precursors and reagents, and still produce a
product of more than just acceptable purity, and in maximum
overall yield. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And as a shaman concerned with the existential
health of my tribe, it was also my duty to discover and relate
all possible knowledge to the people who would need such
information to use the psychedelic substances wisely. This aspect
of my work turned out to be by far the more difficult, for not
only had we lost touch with (eradicated, actually) much ancient
wisdom gained over millennia by the shamanic traditions, but the
modern political, social, and even scientific climates made it
practically impossible to recapture much of that early wisdom in
the natural way. The modern situation colored and distorted our
abilities to reproduce the mindset that would naturally see the
psychedelic experience as sacrament: the modern orientation had
first suspected the diabolical, then the insane, and soon
thereafter was trying to discover how to use psychedelics as
weapons of war and subterfuge. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Luckily, my friends, who were experienced in
that sort of thing, were able to import my laboratory back across
the border no questions asked. And so I found myself, back in
Somewhere U.S.A., (still a draft evader), and with an interest
that attracted over the next several years various groups of
persons wanting to promote the clandestine use of psychedelic
drugs, for reasons which seemed to change from noble to pecuniary
in proportion to the success achieved.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately the prohibition of psychedelics
has for the last quarter-century prevented much progress from
being made on elaborating the details of the neurological effects
of LSD and other psychedelics in the human brain. As I mentioned
previously, the very modest amount of work that <i>has</i> been
done was with laboratory animals, or <i>in vitro</i> cultures of
nerve cells, and has in general been directed toward
toxicological or forensic ends. Thus there is not alot of
reliable data available on how normal doses of psychedelic
substances affect normal neurochemistry in normal human subjects
experiencing the more valuable and interesting aspects of
psychedelic experience. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If for the past several years experiments could
have been performed using volunteers, especially experienced
psychedelic users, in the attempt to accumulate some reliable
data, the task I will now attempt would be far more
straightforward. For example, I suspect that if the new and
powerful scanning techniques of PET and MRI were combined with
the experimental ingenuity of some of the top cognitive
neuroscientists to illuminate the brain mechanisms paralleling
cognitive processes altered by psychedelics, we would rather
quickly find out alot more about not only the mechanisms of
action of psychedelic drugs, but many other neuro-psychological
realities as well. If mere speculation about the psychedelic
experience has led me to discover a major new brain function
(assuming that the HRS mechanism is as important as I suspect,
and corresponds to various discoverable patterns of neural
signaling in the brain), imagine what a little serious research
is likely to turn up. Needless to say, even the underground
scientist of independent means is unlikely to have access to
Positron Emission Tomography equipment. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nevertheless, I have gleaned enough data from
existing research to at least advance a few preliminary guesses
as to the neuromechanics of the Habit Suspension Model of
psychedelic experience. But before I venture into this minefield
of complexity I must discuss some further implications and
illustrations of the habit routine search cognitive process that
I have hypothesized. In proposing the habit routine search
mechanism as a fundamental but previously undiscovered brain/mind
process not only out of necessity to explain psychedelic effects,
but also from the perspective of other psychological,
anthropological, and evolutionary viewpoints, I hope to build
some badly needed bridges between these disciplines utilizing the
new model. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The phenomena discussed below, when viewed
through the new lens of the HRS model, start to be understandable
in a new way. But in addition, since current discipline-specific
models leave much to be desired in attempting to explain at least
some these phenomena, they <i>demand </i>a new and global way of
understanding them. The habit routine interpretation is not just
an alternative model for aspects of reality already well modeled,
but a viewpoint which may be able to unite poorly understood and
diverse phenomena under a common theoretical outlook. All of the
topics I will mention deserve more space than I can give them
here, some would require a lengthy analysis, but at the risk of
over-simplification, I don't believe I need an exhaustive
treatment to show just how wide the application of the habit
routine model might conceivably be. My attempts to propose
neurological models also will require reference back to these
many topics:</p>

<p> <b>Anthropology</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In anthropology, our understanding of the
phenomenon of shamanism and the ability of shamans to temporarily
divest themselves of their culture-bound cognitive limitations
using psychedelic preparations suddenly becomes much more than
the drugged delusions of the primitive mind as some have
suggested. The historian of religion Mircea Eliade wrote in 1951,
&quot;But we have seen that, in shamanism itself,
narcotics...represent a decadence and that, in default of true
ecstatic methods, recourse is taken to narcotics to induce
trance.&quot; <a name="back1"></a><a href="#footnote1">(1)</a>
Naturally, if one's whole viewpoint concerning
&quot;narcotics&quot; has been shaped by the Prohibitionist Ideal
of Twentieth Century Western Civilization, it would have been
difficult indeed in 1951 to recognize the true significance of
the use, not of narcotics, but psychedelics by tribal peoples.
But Eliade's view is stillclung to today by more than a few
so-called scholars, yet paradoxically their own
&quot;culture-bound cognitive limitations&quot; strikingly
revealed in the mentioned Prohibitionist Ideal are as in need of
cure as were those of the tribal peoples they see as decadent. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The great importance of shamans and psychedelic
drugs to so many early societies can now be seen much more in
terms of the temporary yet cumulative cognitive advantages that
psychedelic experience would have conferred. The success of
shamans in curing some of the diseases of tribal members under
their care takes on new meaning, as does the use of psychedelic
agents in rituals for initiation into adulthood, for devination
and the making of important decisions, and more. Psychedelic
experience as habit suspension unites the understanding of many
aspects of the life and evolution of Early Man. And far from
being a decadent substitute for &quot;true ecstatic methods&quot;
as some insist, I will show that psychedelic use was and remains
the genuine article for which many less efficacious substitutes
were tried and abandoned. The stability, longevity and ecology of
many ancient societies could only have been a by-product of
cultural wisdom; if limited and narrow from our modern point of
view, such wisdom certainly was not accidental, and in some
respects represents ideals which modern industrial civilization
has not even pretended to espouse. Our knowledge of ancient
psychedelic plants and their use is the subject of many excellent
books and reviews now available <a name="back2"></a><a
href="#footnote2">(2)</a>; the knowledge represented in these
works goes far beyond the primitive views that were prevalent in
1951. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The transformation of shamanism into organized
religion, a much discussed though poorly understood process, was
most certainly a process which was paralleled by the
discontinuance of the use of psychedelic preparations. Insofar as
this transformation has also been one in which doctrine and dogma
have not only replaced, but forbidden direct individual
experience of spiritual realities, it would be difficult to
maintain that the change worked for the benefit of the individual
in need of spiritual fulfillment. It seems obvious that the
transformation was a political one, brought about by those
requiring control over their subjects through the creation and
manipulation of cognitive habit routines, and especially the
prevention of the use of methods enabling the individual to
bypass the limitations imposed on him. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The transformation was certainly not a
refinement which led to peace and harmony among early
civilizations having organized religions and priesthoods. Lack of
peace and harmony among nations and civilizations has, in fact,
become the most important behavioral characteristic of the human
species insofar as it threatens that species with extinction.
Individuals, robbed of their access to direct experience of
religious truth (and here there is no substitute: religious truth
is something that <i>must</i> be personally experienced), become
members of a society which can be coerced by petty tyrants into
all sorts of collective insanities. In a future chapter I will
extrapolate the importance of early shamanism and the use of
psychedelic plants in two directions: firstly to show that a very
significant role for psychedelics can be hypothesized in the
early evolution of man; and to supply yet one more sermon on the
faults of modern civilization and what might be done about it.</p>

<p> <b>Meditation and Other Techniques</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The understanding of meditation techniques, sensory
deprivation, religious ecstasy provoked by various insults to the
body, and the panoply of other methods that human individuals
seeking enlightenment and self-transcendence have employed down
through the ages becomes unified by the present model of habit
routine search and suspension. I propose that all these diverse
techniques are more-or-less effectivemethods for achieving what
the psychedelic drugs do more efficiently and directly, viz., to
suspend one's programming as represented in the personal
collection of habit routines. If there is something to be said
for the &quot;naturalness&quot; of non-drug methods, methods
whereby the individual is purportedly gaining the ability to
achieve transcendent states at will, there is even a stronger
statement to be made by the obvious unnaturalness of the more
violent and self-destructive methods of certain religious
ascetics: extreme fasting and mortification of the flesh, such
techniques must be seen as quite primitive substitutes for the
use of natural psychedelic plants, quite benign by comparison. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Note that I do not propose that these various
techniques affect brain operation through exactly the same
mechanisms: the outcome of altered or suspended habit routines
may be realized by quite different mechanisms and points of
intervention in neurological operation, both neurochemical or
self-induced, as I have already suggested. The hypothesis of the
HRS system being the fundamental and primary cognitive operation
of the nervous system upon which all the ensuing processes of
thinking are based, fits well with the proposal that there would
likely be many diverse ways to alter the system as a whole,
especially considering the cybernetic nature of most if not all
brain processes.</p>

<p> <b>Instinct</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The operation of what have been called instincts,
both in animals and man himself, may now be understood in a new
way. Although the capacity and characteristics of memory in
animals are generally agreed to be very limited compared with
man, the use of data implanted by experience, as well as the
genetically-expressed data of the collective experience of a
species, not as long-term memory in LMA, but as data for the
operation of HRS, seems a promising new approach in ethology.
Chapter 6 will explore some of this territory. </p>

<p><b>Personality and the Unconscious</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In psychology and psychiatry we may begin to
understand better what the personality is, where and how the
neurological data that result in observed personality traits is
stored and accessed. A more physiological and operational
understanding of the properties of the &quot;unconscious
mind&quot; may now be possible, and may extend to understanding
how the prevalence of irrational belief can coexist in the same
society, even the same individual, with logic and rationality. We
may be able to apply the new concepts to the understanding of
phobias, neuroses, and personality disorders, the power of
propaganda and the phenomenon of crowd madness, the
neurocognitive correlates of prejudice, and the practice of
methods by certain individuals which seem to render them much
less susceptible to these major human weaknesses.</p>

<p> <b>Human - Animal Dichotomy</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fundamental difference between man and animal
is an ancient question, still debated from the perspective of
many opposing viewpoints. The habit routine model may provide a
new assessment of man's uniqueness in his ability to suspend or
modify the operation of habit routine at will, (with practice),
and so develop and cultivate the ability to be creative. I think
it is safe to say that animals have the ability to be creative,
at least in a simple way, but they exhibit such ability only when
there is little alternative, as in a crisis, or in experiments
designed to elicit such behavior. They do not do so out of the
exercise of free will, so much is obvious. Man can, however,
cultivate and practice the art, and dwell in a creative state by
choice, but this is not to say that most human beings make the
required effort to do so to any significant extent. Thus proposed
differences between man and animal have to date always seemed
merely a matter of degree rather than substance, animals
exhibiting any suggested trait simply on a less complex level.
Tool-making, language, music and dance, and other examples could
be cited. Understanding the difference as a major reorientation
from a habit routine governed mode of existence to at least a
potentially Creative-Individual Mode <a name="back3"></a><a
href="#footnote3">(3)</a> may be the characteristic which is more
of substance than degree. Further exploration of this topic must
also await future chapters. </p>

<p><b>The Binding Problem</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The so-called binding problem in philosophy and
psychology, the lack of an adequate psychological or neurological
theory to explain how unitary consciousness arises out of the
multiplicity of sensory signals which arrive at the brain, (and
the multitude of independent channels of sensory processing that
have recently been demonstrated), may have a solution using the
ideas I have suggested. With the recent elaboration of Parallel
Distributed Processing models of brain function, where it is not
even suggested that there is a central structure
&quot;responsible&quot; for consciousness, the binding problem
has become even more mysterious, to philosophers at least. But if
our unitary conscious experience is not the experience or
awareness of the totality of sensory input (and mental
reflection) itself, but rather the after-the-fact experience of
our own habit routines <i>activated by the sensory data</i>, and
overlaid with only a sparse sampling of the sensory data relevant
to the habit routine complex called into play, the binding
problem disappears. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The relative absence of brain structures which
associate all the sensory data from the various sensory inputs
and intermediate processing areas to produce overall unitary or
&quot;bound&quot; awareness is no longer a mystery, because
unitary experience of external reality is an illusion. What we
experience are the cognitive or perceptual structures provided by
our own habit routines which enable the evaluation of only the
most salient or attended to aspects of external reality; we see,
hear, and understand only what we have already seen, heard, and
understood, plus a small fragment of new sensory data which
relates agreement or disagreement, the presence of novelty or
sameness. It is through this deceptively small window upon the
external that we exercise our apparently powerful abilities of
free will and creativity. The power over external events which
results, although demonstrably quite limited, seems great, great
enough to install in us an illusion of control far greater than
the evidence warrants. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If one of the fundamental questions in cognitive
science has been whether perceptual data for which there is no
conscious awareness can influence behavior, then from the above
it can be seen that not only is this possible, but since the
total sensory input is used primarily (almost exclusively) to
select habit routine complexes in thinking1, which is entirely a
pre-conscious operation, then the conclusion is that sensory data
is <i>primarily </i>unconscious and the <i>primary </i>&quot;causative&quot;
agent in behavior! I will return to the binding problem during my
discussion of the brain systems which enable the construction of
habit routines. </p>

<p><b>The Experiments of Benjamin Libet</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The time delay between sensory signaling and the
subjective conscious perception of sensation which has so
carefully been demonstrated by neurosurgeon Benjamin Libet and
other experimenters may also have a simpler explanation than
those proposed so far. Libet and others have shown that a
pin-prick of the finger, for example, transmits a signal to the
cortex of the brain via the thalamus, which arrives in a few
thousandths of a second. All sensory signaling except olfaction
is similarly transmitted: first to the thalamus which acts as a
sort of relay-station distributing the signals to the appropriate
domains of the cortex. Yet conscious perception of the pin-prick
can by various experimental techniques be shown to be delayed by
up to a half-second, while &quot;cerebral neuronal adequacy&quot;
is achieved. <a name="back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">(4)</a> It
is proposed that there is then &quot;a subjective referral
backwards in time, after neuronal adequacy is achieved, which
antedates the [perception of the] experience to correspond to the
time of early cortical responses...&quot; [the onset of signaling
measured after a few thousandths of a second]. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The alternative view that I propose is that the
original sensory signaling, passing through the thalamus, is
projected to all the appropriate areas of the cortex, and it is
this signal, by comparison with all the stored data representing
the frames of memory, which generates the habit routine complex
which is then used in the thinking2 processes of perception and
symbolization. The time delay corresponds precisely to the time
necessary for all the thinking1 (pre-conscious) comparisons of
current sensory signals with LTM (long-term-memory) to assemble
the habit routine complex to be presented to thinking2. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; According to my view then, the original signals
from the periphery of the body, projected upon the cortex by the
thalamus, are not at all the &quot;data&quot; of which we become
aware. This original sensory &quot;data&quot; will be selected,
trimmed, and mostly eliminated during the process of HRS (habit
routine search), and only details from the data which are
relevant to the habit routine complex brought to awareness will
be included. Thus the greatest part, by far, of the
&quot;data&quot; which is experienced, the supposed &quot;bound
awareness&quot; of external reality, is merely the data that
already existed as LTM. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The problem of how experience is referred
backwards in time is also neatly resolved since what is
experienced is the habit routine complex generated from sensory
data received <i>at the time</i> of the pin-prick or other
peripheral input: the habit routine complex represents the
sensory data at the instant of reception into thinking1, not at
the (up to) half-second later instant of perception in thinking2.
The variability of the time delay may represent the level of
complexity of the HRS process required in each case, a strong
sensory signal is perceived more rapidly than a minimal one
because less cognitive effort is required to construct a habit
routine when the salient data is stronger than the background
sensory information. Remember that both strong and weak signals
arrive at the cortex with the same small time delay (&quot;a few
thousandths of a second&quot;). </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The idea that &quot;perception is a function of
expectation&quot; <a name="back5"></a><a href="#footnote5">(5)</a>
is, of course, not new. But the dependence has so far been seen
more as a minor imperfection or inconvenience, easily over-ridden
by careful observation especially by he who is in the act of
studying such phenomena. The new view provided by my theory shows
that very attitude to be a product of the &quot;minor
inconvenience&quot;, the magnitude of its influence being
directly proportional to the certainty of its negligibility. I
repeat: in a very literal sense, we see what we have already
seen, hear what we have already heard, think what we have already
thought, believe what we have already believed, and I'm afraid in
most instances in most people most of the time, little else.
Illusions to the contrary may well be provided and sustained by
installed habit routines! Disagreement with this analysis may
well provide evidence for its accuracy! </p>

<p><b>Further Experiments</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a further series of investigations, Libet was
able to show a similar and apparently much more mysterious
anomaly. A carefully executed series of experiments seemed to
call into question the operation, perhaps even the existence of
&quot;free will&quot; as we know it. Again, the results were
indicated by the existence of various time delays in neural
signaling relative to tasks that the subject was asked to carry
out. Here is an abstract of theoriginal article: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Voluntary acts are preceded by electrophysiological
    &quot;readiness potentials&quot; (RPs). With spontaneous acts
    involving no preplanning, the main negative RP shift begins
    at about -550 [milliseconds]. Such RPs were used to indicate
    the minimum onset times for the cerebral activity that
    precedes a fully endogenous voluntary act. The time of
    conscious intention to act was obtained from the subject's
    recall of the spatial clock position of a revolving spot at
    the time of his initial awareness of intending or wanting to
    move (W). W occurred at about -200 ms. Control experiments in
    which a skin stimulus was timed (S), helped evaluate each
    subject's error in reporting the clock times for awareness of
    any perceived event. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>For spontaneous voluntary acts, RP onset preceded the
    uncorrected Ws by about 350 ms and the Ws corrected for S by
    about 400 ms. The direction of this difference was consistent
    and significant throughout, regardless of which of several
    measures of RP onset or W were used. It was concluded that
    cerebral initiation of a spontaneous voluntary act begins
    unconsciously. However, it was found that the final decision
    to act could still be consciously controlled during the 150
    ms or so remaining after the specific conscious intention
    appears. Subjects can in fact &quot;veto&quot; motor
    performance during a 100-200-ms period before a prearranged
    time to act. The role of conscious will would be not to
    initiate a specific voluntary act but rather to select and
    control volitional outcome. It is proposed that conscious
    will can function in a permissive fashion, either to permit
    or to prevent the motor implementation of the intention to
    act that arises unconsciously. Alternatively, there may be
    the need for a conscious activation or triggering, without
    which the final motor output would not follow the unconscious
    cerebral initiating and preparatory processes. <a
    name="back6"></a><a href="#footnote6">(6)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Although Libet himself commented in the closing
section of his paper, &quot;...it is important to emphasize that
the present experimental findings and analysis do not exclude the
potential for 'philosophically real' individual responsibility
and free will&quot;, several writers have, at least in popular
presentations, rather exaggerated the possible implications of
the experiments: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>...The conclusion is that we are deluded in believing that
    each of us is a free agent who may decide to take an action.
    Such a decision is an interpretation we give to a behavior
    that has been initiated someplace else by another part of
    ourselves well before we are aware of making a decision at
    all. In other words, the decision has been made before we are
    aware of the idea to even make a decision. If &quot;we&quot;
    are not pulling the strings, then who or what is? The answer
    is, it is an unknown part that is unfathomable to
    introspection. <a name="back7"></a><a href="#footnote7">(7)</a>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>...Here we have physiological confirmation of Ambrose
    Bierce's definition of 'intention' as apprehending the
    imminence of an action. Behind the scenes the blind
    brain-mind is determining what action to take, and when to
    initiate it. And as it sends out messages to the muscles to
    move, so it also initiates processes that may end up as a
    conscious <i>prediction</i> of the act that is already on its
    way. Consciousness, however, ignorant of its own foundations,
    takes this prediction, and re-interprets it as control. <a
    name="back8"></a><a href="#footnote8">(8)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Actually there are some elements of truth in
these observations, as I hope to show below, but they do not
support the implied positions of the authors. The peer commentary
in the same journal as Libet's original article, it must be said,
did not at all suffer from the same exaggeration, but presented a
range of quite perceptive criticisms of the methodology of the
experiments and suggested several less extreme psychological,
neurological and philosophical conclusions, yet Libet was in my
opinion able to support his position effectively. But none of the
commentators seemed able to simplify the experimental results and
their implications with a new modelof what might actually be
taking place. Let me first describe some further details of the
experiments: </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Each experimental subject was asked to observe a
kind of TV monitor on which was projected a spot of light
rotating around the center of the screen. This was the timing
device: psychological and sensory events were timed by observing
their occurrence relative to the clock-position of the spot of
light. The subject could then relate, for example, the timing of
a pin-prick or other event such as a decision, to the position of
the spot at say, three o'clock. The subject was then asked, at a
completely random moment chosen by himself, to suddenly flex the
fingers of his hand, and observe the clock-position of the spot
of light at the moment of his being aware of having made the
decision to flex his fingers. What was consistently found was
that an electrical signal in the cortex of the brain, the
&quot;readiness potential&quot;, would appear about four-tenths
of a second <i>before</i> the subject signaled his awareness that
he had made the decision to flex, and that the actual flexing of
the muscles appeared about two-tenths of a second <i>after</i>
the apparent time of the decision. The fact that these were
considered startling and unexpected experimental results is
illustrated by the depth and intensity of controversy that ensued
in trying to explain the results within the framework of the
various critics' paradigms. What was debated by all was the
question of volition. How could the decision to take a voluntary
act, which in anyone's book must certainly be a <i>conscious</i>
event, be preceded by an <i>unconscious </i>event of such
regularity that the timing of the ensuing muscle movement could
be predicted from it? </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The answer, according to the habit routine
model, is that there was no volition whatsoever concerning the
decision to flex the fingers. This was a &quot;decision&quot;
pre-programmed to take place as an instruction in working memory
for the selection and implementation of habit routines that would
lead to the desired movement. The trigger for this decision was
another instruction in working memory, the instruction to &quot;<i>choose
a random moment</i>&quot;. The volition involved in the overall
process consisted of the voluntary programming of working memory
by the subject to carry out the instructions of the experiment,
nothing more. And nothing less, especially, for in this process
we observe quite unambiguously the operation of free will: the
subject chooses quite freely to follow the instructions of the
experiment, and consciously programs his working memory with the
recipe for carrying out the desired sequence, <i>viz</i>., choose
a random moment, notice the position of the timing device, and
then flex the fingers. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Owen Flanagan has expressed a similar
interpretation of the experiment. But his philosophical intent
seems to be to argue against any idea that mind might be anything
other than something <i>caused </i>by physical,
observable-in-principle brain processes. He calls his position on
the mind/brain debate &quot;constructive naturalism&quot;, but
seems to fall into the same trap concerning causation that I
mentioned previously: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I conclude that Libet's results, far from offering solace
    to the suspicious epiphenomenalist, are precisely the sort of
    results one would expect if one believes that conscious
    processes are subserved by nonconscious neural activity, and
    that conscious processes play variable but significant causal
    roles at various points in different cognitive domains. <a
    name="back9"></a><a href="#footnote9">(9)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The first proposition, &quot;conscious processes
are subserved by neural activity&quot;, is in logical
contradiction to the second, &quot;conscious processes play
causal roles&quot;. If the first proposition is taken to mean
that for <i>every</i> conscious process that may be defined or
intuited to exist, then there is necessarily a real, durational,
and logical sequence of neurological operations in the brain
which precedes and causes the conscious activity (causation must
have duration and precede the effect which results), then the
conscious process of the <i>second</i> proposition must be
included: it must also be caused by neurological activity, and so
its apparent causative power is only a reaction to previous
neurological causation. As I stated above, the mind, or
consciousness, is thus reduced to having no actual causative
power at all, it becomes an inoperative concept. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I must also reiterate my own position that this
argument does not automatically make me a &quot;suspicious
epiphenomenalist&quot; nor a closet mysticist. The mind/body
debate has, like so many other debates, become polarized into a
binary reductionism: if you're not in the one camp, you must be
in the other. If you don't believe that the physical
manifestation of the brain &quot;causes&quot; all the mental,
intentional, qualitative, subjective, and yes, spiritual
manifestations of the human (to say &quot;organism&quot; would
already be admitting to the reductionism I am questioning), then
you must be an advocate of mysticism, <i>i.e.,</i> unscientific. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My previous analogy to the dual nature of
electromagnetic radiation is apt, I think, for it illustrates the
same debate that occurred in physics long ago: is light a
particle or a wave? Or both simultaneously? Does the particle
nature of light <i>cause </i>its wave aspects? Or <i>vice versa</i>?
All these questions may only be <i>asked</i> from the point of
view of classical physics, they only have <i>meaning</i> from the
classical view. Once quantum mechanical physics enters the scene,
no one even attempts to answer the questions on the classical
level. If my guess that brain and mind are parallel aspects of a
more fundamental reality is nebulous, perhaps it will take on
some relevance when a &quot;quantum mechanics of philosophy&quot;
will be available. Whether a process of mind studying mind will
accomplish such a feat is still an open question. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope I may be forgiven for having diverged
considerably from my analysis of Libet's findings to repeat an
argument of the previous chapter, for I think that the argument
and the logical inconsistency it points out lend some credibility
to the use of the habit routine model as a way to resolve many
aspects of current debate. The habit routine model is far from
being a mystical proposition, yet it seems that many questions
which previously forced opinion into either the reductionist or
mystical extremes are now moot. If the habit routine model does
not itself show how mind and brain might be parallel and
complimentary aspects of the same thing, it at least weakens some
arguments that such a view must be unscientific. To continue with
the habit routine view of Libet's results: </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I would propose that the time of the onset of
the &quot;readiness potential&quot; corresponds exactly with the
implementation of the instruction in working memory to
&quot;choose a random moment&quot;, and that the ensuing delay
corresponds to the time necessary to activate the habit routine
search process to produce a pattern which seems to the subject to
satisfy the instruction, &quot;choose a random moment.&quot; At
this point, the second and third pre-programmed instructions to
notice the time, and then flex the fingers is launched, and the
ensuing delay again corresponds to the time necessary to select
and activate the various habit routines necessary to implement
the physical action. The subjective timing of the intention to
move the fingers occurs when it does because it must await the
success of the first instruction to choose a random moment. When
conscious awareness is satisfied that this criterion has been
met, it &quot;approves&quot; the continuation of the instruction
sequence in working memory. Notice that I have adhered to my
intuition that mind and brain are simultaneous, not causative in
either direction; in this example the readiness potential is the
physical attribute of the larger process which is implementing
the instructions of free will. </p>

<p><b>Hallucinations</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have already alluded to the idea that the
so-called hallucinations resulting from psychedelic experience
are not &quot;real&quot; or strong hallucinations at all. In this
case, normal sensory data, perceived without the usual framework
of acceptable habit routines to organize and categorize the
perceived sensations, becomes itself seemingly hallucinatory (in
the naive subject) because it is perceived &quot;as is&quot;.
And, as I mentioned previously, the perception of such sensory
input, especially if the set and setting of the experience are
threatening (as in the above account of a hospital-setting LSD
session), will through feedback to further thinking1 habit
routine search produce even more bizarre results, greater
feelings of loss of control, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Classical hallucinations produced by brain
pathologies and various diseases are a quite different
phenomenon, as was noted by many of the early psychedelic
researchers. It was in fact the widespread dissatisfaction with
the term &quot;hallucinogen&quot; (and also
&quot;psychotomimetic&quot;) which led to the coining of the term
&quot;psychedelic&quot; as a properly descriptive name for these
substances. Classical hallucination produced by brain pathology
(or as manifested in the delirium tremens of end-stage
alcoholism, for example), is probably outside the domain of the
habit routine model, although the psychological and cognitive
results of certain nervous system diseases may assist in devising
the neurological model of habit routine search. In the next
chapter I will discuss some types of brain damage which provide
such evidence. </p>

<p><b>Subliminal Perception</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Many diverse psychological experiments have been
able to show that information from a briefly encountered
experience, although not subsequently accessible to normal recall
of memory, nevertheless provides data which the subject uses
&quot;unconsciously&quot;. <a name="back10"></a><a
href="#footnote10">(10)</a> In recent studies, the terms
&quot;explicit memory&quot; and &quot;implicit memory&quot; are
used to denote sensory information which can, or cannot be
consciously recalled. The terms correspond roughly to what I have
called LMA, or logical memory access (explicit memory) and the
output of the habit routine search system (implicit memory). But
defining the two as different <i>types</i> of memory obscures
what the habit routine model makes clear: the memory
&quot;data&quot; is the same, it is the method of access which is
different. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A typical experiment would run something like
this: Subjects are given a brief exposure to a word presented on
a screen. A 30 millisecond showing is not long enough for the
subject to recognize that he has seen anything at all, yet in
subsequent testing the word will be identified more frequently
from lists of random words than statistics would predict.
Research on subliminal perception had been motivated by studies
of amnesic-syndrome sufferers, who had often been observed to
have intact implicit-memory function despite gravely affected
ability to recall autobiographical events. A patient afflicted
with amnesia might be taught a procedure, for example, and shown
by testing to have retained at least some information that he had
learned. Yet he would have absolutely no memory for the time or
place nor the procedure in which he had learned this information.
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Daniel L. Schacter (footnote 8) has identified
five types of evidence for the dissociation or independence of
these two memory processes and concluded, &quot;Taken together,
the...studies constitute solid evidence for a fundamental
difference between implicit and explicit memory.&quot; The
evidence, I believe, fits the Habit Routine Model like a glove,
but it is not at all necessary to propose independent memory
systems to explain it. The Habit Routine Model proposes that the
same memory &quot;data&quot; from exactly the same distributed
sources in the various domains of the cortex, are accessed and
assembled by two different processes, one automatic, ongoing, and
pre-conscious (HRS in thinking1), the other voluntary,
deliberate, and accomplished by feedback of cues assembled from
conscious analysis and evaluation of thinking2 (LMA). </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The model illustrates how HRS can retrieve
information from the briefly perceived, subliminal exposition,
yet LMA, which must have reference to a process of duration,
cannot access the same data. The film frame/clip analogy is
useful here: the 30ms exposure is recorded, just like all sensory
data, but it represents only a frame of a film. LMA must access a
sequence of frames during recall, a series of time-related frames
of a certain duration, a &quot;film clip&quot;. This may be a
result of the nature of the cues which are used in LMA, or
perhaps just the inherent operating characteristics of the brain
system which reconstructs conscious memories. Or it might be
hypothesized that the memory of an instantaneous cross-section in
time, like the 30ms. exposure, would simply not register in
consciousness, thus no process of cue-construction necessary to
retrieve a memory would be possible. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; An interesting experiment suggests itself to
attempt to show the operation of information collected and
useable as habit routines, but not accessible in LMA. A series of
images is shown, all subliminally, demonstrating one of several
possible logical relations between several different generic
objects depicted in the images. By &quot;generic&quot; I mean
that the objects do not have individual or &quot;personal&quot;
characteristics, but denote a type, or a class. Numbers or
letters in a non-descript font would be a good example, as would
simple geometric figures. In each image is also a prominent and
unchanging &quot;reference&quot; object which does have intrinsic
specific characteristics, a photograph of Jack Nicholson perhaps.
The images may be interspersed with other images, both subliminal
and perceptible, or they may even be inserted in a short film,
for instance. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Afterwards the subject is asked to deduce a
possible logical relation between the several types of generic
objects, now shown continuously, in one case <i>with </i>the
reference object shown, and in another case <i>without</i> the
reference. To deduce any one of the several possible logical
relations between the generic objects requires a logical sequence
of brain/mind operations, including attention and decision,
reference to previously learned knowledge of similar cases, it
requires deliberation of a complex nature. The logical relation
between the generic test objects implied by the series of
subliminal frames, if deduced preferentially over other possible
logical relations when the reference object is included, would
indicate that habit routines had been installed by the data in
the images; the co-presentation of the reference object should
reinforce the habit routine learned about the logical relation
indicated by the images. And not only would the routines be
invisible to LMA, but even recall of the objects themselves would
be nil. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Note that some preference for the required
logical relation should be present even without the reference
object. The prediction is that a small preference should be found
without, and a larger and much more significant preference with
the reference object present. This is because the reference
object has obvious and strong individual characteristics which
would be expected to activate the assembly of habit routines in
which it played a part, whereas the test objects have little or
no specific characteristics. The experiment would demonstrate
that even complex logical decisions, supposedly made on the basis
of consciously applied information and calculation, are
nevertheless guided by invisible and pre-emptory patterns
installed in memory in perhaps involuntary and illogical ways.
(What would be logical about preferentially choosing one of
several relations among geometric figures based on a picture of
Jack Nicholson being present?!). </p>

<p><b>Context - Dependent Memory</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This proposed experiment is a reduction to the
subliminal perception level of a more general phenomenon called <i>Context-Dependent
Memory</i>, which was described as long ago as 1690: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The British associationist philosopher John Locke refers
    to the case of a young man who was taught to dance. His
    lessons always took place in the same room which contained a
    large trunk. Alas, it subsequently proved to be the case
    that: &quot;The idea of this remarkable piece of household
    stuff had so mixed itself with the turns and steps of all his
    dances, that though in that chamber he could dance
    excellently well, yet it was only while the trunk was
    there.&quot; <a name="back11"></a><a href="#footnote11">(11)</a>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental studies of context-dependent memory
in recent years have established the importance of the effect,
but no general cognitive model has been proposed which might
explain its operation. The application of the habit routine model
may consolidate understanding of several currently studied
aspects of memory. Baddeley reports a particularly interesting
study, the results of which lend themselves directly to
interpretation using the habit routine model. This interpretation
of context-dependent memory will additionally lead us into
another question of importance for understanding HRS and LMA and
how these processes are initiated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Is it actually necessary for the subject to return
    physically to the same environment for context-dependent
    effects to work, or is it sufficient to imagine the original
    environment? This was explored in a study by Smith (1979) who
    had his subjects study 80 common words in a distinctive
    basement room on the first day, and then attempt to recall
    them on a second day in either the same room, or in a
    fifth-floor room with very different contents and
    furnishings. Subjects who recalled in the original basement
    room tended to remember about 18 words, significantly more
    than those who remembered in the different upstairs room, who
    recalled only about 12. Of particular interest however was a
    third group who were tested in the different upstairs room,
    but instructed to try to recollect as much as possible of the
    original learning environment before starting to recall. They
    remembered an average of 17.2 words, not significantly
    different from those who had physically returned to the
    learning environment. <a name="back12"></a><a
    href="#footnote12">(12)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The habit routine interpretation of these
experimental results would be as follows. The original session in
which the 80 common words were studied was, like all ongoing
cognitive activities, organized around and facilitated by habit
routine complexes which each individual has developed over his
lifetime of conscious activity. They would be roughly similar for
all the subjects, but not identical, some persons obviously
having developed routines for study (the memorization of a list
in this case) which are somewhat different and more or less
effective than those of other individuals. Nevertheless, for a
given subject, habit routines typical for that subject are used
for the learning process, and the information learned is
incorporated into memory as further habit routines based on the
learning routines. Thus the learned data is itself organized into
habit routines related to those used in the learning. We might
think of the learning routine as a sort of template on which the
data to be learned is imbedded. But more than just the
&quot;data&quot; of the words is recorded! All habit routines are
potentially re-assembled from the entire sensory and cognitive
input of the moment (including the habit routines brought to bear
in implementing the ongoing process): if the words were printed
in red ink, if Beethoven's Fifth Symphony were playing at the
time, if one had an annoying itch, all these, including the
general surroundings of the room and the emotional
&quot;feel&quot; thus elicited in the learner, are part of the
habit routine which contains the information concerning the words
studied. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the above experiment, recalling the words
later is improved if the subject is tested in the same room; here
the word information embedded in the habit routine created at the
time of learning is accessed more reliably by the presence of the
sensory input of the room (which matches elements of the original
habit routine). But improvement is also noticed just by asking
the subject to <i>imagine</i> the original learning location. In
this instance, the habit routine is activated by thinking2
imagining the original scene and supplying this as an input
parameter to HRS via working memory. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It has been noticed in many studies that if the
words to be learned can be organized in some way, either
intentionally with a mnemonic or categorization process, or
&quot;unconsciously&quot; by the influence of context, as is the
case here, then subsequent recall is much improved. We may view
this effect as the production of habit routines having an
internal organizational structure, a cross-linking between
elements of the routine, so that recall or recognition may be
brought about by more numerous cueing situations. The context in
which the learning is taking place, the basement room, provides
an organizational framework, as would more intentional or
contrived methods such as relating the words to certain
categories or classes. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This brings us to the related question of the
difference between recall and recognition. In word learning
experiments, a subject can be tested for his <i>recall </i>of
words, <i>i.e.</i>, the words that he can remember on demand; or
for <i>recognition</i>, wherein he is given a list of words only
some of which were words to be learned. The subject then goes
through the list and replies yes or no to each entry. Baddeley
discusses the many experiments that have been done and the
methods used to correct for various errors inherent in the
procedure. <a name="back13"></a><a href="#footnote13">(13)</a> It
has been shown that, as a rule, recognition is far better than
recall, scores for the former being typically twice or more the
scores for recall. A single case study (of myself) illustrates
the disparity and suggests also that using the experimental
paradigm of learning and recall of <i>words</i> (as opposed to
images, or composite sensory patterns) may not tell the whole
story: </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the 1950's and 1960's I often frequented
small record shops to buy cheap (I was a student) and usually
out-of-print jazz record albums. Album cover design, even then,
was crucial in promoting records that were not expected to be big
selling items, and so many were quite original in appearance.
When sifting through the bins, I almost never erred in knowing if
I had already bought an album, yet a printed list of titles was
much less helpful. To this day I can look at an old jazz album on
display, and tell immediately if I already own a copy in my
collection of well over a thousand. A list of titles is much less
effective. And if asked to recall the cover art from a well-known
album, I will usually fail for most items. Out of a thousand, I
can right now bring to mind the cover of perhaps twenty or
thirty, yet somewhere in my head is the &quot;data&quot; required
to recognize them all. I predict, on the basis of my own
experience here, that if experiments on recall <i>vs.</i>
recognition were performed using visual and perhaps audio
material, as well as composite sensory input, the disparity
between recall and recognition would far outpace the results
found for word study tasks. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Baddeley notes, &quot;The question of how recall
and recognition are related is one of the oldest in the study of
memory. It is also one that remains complex and
controversial.&quot; I think that the Habit Routine Model may
have some ability to simplify the controversy, for the
distinction between recall and recognition parallels closely the
distinction I have made between LMA and HRS. In recognition, the
result comes about automatically and rapidly through HRS, the
effect of context being entirely &quot;pre-conscious&quot;, an
operation of thinking1 processes; whereas in recall, the context
can be consciously recreated to assist in the process as in the
experiment above. Thus in the recall of words learned in the
basement room, the subject can improve his score by simulating
the context, using LMA to intentionally reconstruct the look and
feel of the basement room. In the experiment that I have proposed
(showing a series of subliminal images containing the constant
context or non-generic item), the context item automatically
supplies access to habit routines which produce the response. In
the basement room experiment the working memory is intentionally
programmed with a reconstruction of the context (in the case of
the upstairs recall), which then as a parameter for ongoing
thinking1 assists in recall. </p>

<p><b>Filling In</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another phenomenon of recent interest and debate
which may benefit from a habit routine interpretation is <i>filling
in</i>. In its simplest aspect, it has long been known that due
to the particular structure of the eye, there is a small blind
spot on each retina at the position of its attachment to the
optic nerve. The portion of the visual scene projected here is
therefore not represented in the visual cortex of the brain, yet
we have no awareness that there are two blank spots in our field
of view. (A simple experiment that all children are taught shows
the reality of the blind spot.) The process whereby the brain
nevertheless produces an apparent continuous field of view is
called filling-in, and some examples of recent research and
controversy are nicely summarized by Francis Crick. <a
name="back14"></a><a href="#footnote14">(14)</a> Although the
filling-in of the blind spot may be a quite simple process in
normal persons (the retina itself may play some supporting role)
a more extensive and higher-order kind of filling-in is known to
occur with brain-damaged patients. Crick reviews the research of
Ramachandran <a name="back15"></a><a href="#footnote15">(15)</a>
and his colleagues and concludes, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Filling-in is probably not a special process peculiar to
    the blind spot. It is more likely that, in one form or
    another, it occurs at many levels in the normal brain. It
    allows the brain to guess a complete picture from only
    partial information-a very useful ability. <a name="back16"></a><a
    href="#footnote16">(16)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Habit Routine Model agrees entirely with
this assessment that only partial information arrives at
conscious awareness, yet an apparently seamless perception of
reality results. But the model goes even further in saying that
most, or nearly all, of the data we believe we are perceiving is
the data produced by the &quot;filling-in&quot; that the habit
routine search process has provided. It is not surprising then
that such a powerful system can fill in the minor amounts of data
lacking due to the characteristics of the retinae, or even of
damage to the visual cortex of the brain. </p>

<p><b>Synaesthesia</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Along with the renewal of interest in consciousness
and the mind/body problem in the wake of the demise of
behaviorism has come a wave of new theories about long-known yet
little-understood phenomena such as synaesthesia, the cross-over
or confusion of two or more sensory domains. Popular books about
such long-standing enigmas have reached a wide audience. In
observing the disparity of proposed theories attempting to
explain some of these phenomena, it becomes evident that
psychology and the study of the mind is still in its infancy. But
also, due to the breakneck pace at which research is now
eliciting important if uncoordinated results, it seems of
paramount importance for some part of this wide area of
exploration to devote its efforts to providing linkages between
the various disciplines, attempting to design overall theoretical
frameworks which deal with all the phenomena on a unified basis.
If not, I fear we are in for even greater overall confusion,
disagreement, and controversy. In reaction, a new brand of
behaviorist, mechanistic, nothing-but-ism is likely to take hold
to again stifle creative approaches in man's study of himself. I
make these comments here because a recent book on Synaesthesia <a
name="back17"></a><a href="#footnote17">(17)</a> illustrates the
lack of coordination in recent theoretical approaches. I should
not single out this book from the many others which have
purported to &quot;explain&quot; consciousness or various aspects
thereof; reading several of these is more like watching a
sporting match than an exposition of a deliberate research
undertaking. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The quotation from <i>The Man Who Tasted Shapes </i>above,
in the section on Benjamin Libet's time-delay research,
exemplifies the point, I believe. One-upmanship contests, perhaps
encouraged by editors and publishers, take precedence over
accurate representation of others' work. As for synaesthesia,
Cytowic presents interesting theoretical ideas, but limits them
by inaccuracy of presentation of supporting evidence. This is
certainly the case where he attempts to present results of
psychedelic research to support his ideas. <a name="back18"></a><a
href="#footnote18">(18)</a> Reported synaesthesia during
psychedelic experience has occurred frequently enough to warrant
attention. Yet scientific attention is so severely limited by
research restrictions that it is certainly a dubious conclusion
that psychedelic synaesthesia has anything more than coincidental
parallels to naturally-occurring synaesthesia. Cytowic remarks, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Ethical considerations guarantee that 1950s-era government
    research into the effects of LSD on humans will never be
    repeated. While no contemporary research exists, however, the
    older data about the drug's general effects on the nervous
    system are reliable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The statement reveals, I fear, a dual ignorance.
If the unethical 1950s-era research he refers to is that
undertaken by the CIA, (and highly unethical it was, along with
much if not most other CIA &quot;intelligence&quot; activities),
then Cytowic displays a glaring unawareness of the research of
the dozens of workers who administered many thousands of
psychedelic experiences in which ethics were not only respected
but a primary consideration. But if Cytowic is ignoring this much
greater body of highly ethical research for the abominable
fumblings of the weapons and mind-control crowd of MK-ULTRA/CIA
fame, it is highly questionable to then express confidence about
&quot;older data being reliable.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is simple enough to explain psychedelic
synaesthesia in terms of habit routine suspension, (I will leave
it as an exercise for the reader!), but I believe that the habit
routine model may also succeed quite well in explaining naturally
occurring synaesthesia. Cytowic states that synaesthesia is a
product of the limbic system, not the cortex, and with this the
habit routine model is in moderate agreement. I will show in the
next chapter the interplay between the cortex and various centers
of the limbic system which brings about the various habit routine
cognitive operations. But rather than having to postulate an
enhancement of limbic activities, or the actual crossing-over at
some point of sensory signals as others have done, (both of these
hypotheses depend on the supposition that it is the bound
awareness of all the sensory domains which consciousness
perceives), a simple and small change in the limbic activities
which access and apply habit routines is the only hypothesis
necessary. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once again we see that if it is not bound
sensory awareness of which we are conscious, but rather our own
habit routines, the mechanism underlying the phenomenon is easily
imagined, rather than requiring several hypothetical nervous
system operations unsupported by any existing research. And once
again I think, the habit routine model shows its capability to
moot certain questions of controversy by providing an overall
structure in which previously misunderstood or misinterpreted
phenomena are now brought together. </p>

<p><b>The Newly - Sighted</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another such phenomenon recently discussed in a
popular book <a name="back19"></a><a href="#footnote19">(19)</a>
concerns persons who have been blind for many years and whose
sight is then restored, the &quot;newly sighted&quot;. Oliver
Sacks relates the rare yet typical case of Virgil, a man blind
since early youth due to heavy cataracts. At the age of fifty, he
undergoes the relatively simple and risk-free operation for
cataract removal. All are hopeful for wonderful results, yet, as
has been noted in the handful of cases with other newly-sighted
patients, curious and difficult problems arise and persist, and
the final result has often been disappointment and tragedy: Not
because sight is not restored, but as Sacks relates in a lengthy
and fascinating account of Virgil's tribulations, sight seems to
be extremely difficult to understand and interpret in such a
situation. According to the habit routine model, we could say
that firstly, Virgil had no available perceptual habit routines
to be activated by visual stimulation, therefore what he
&quot;sees&quot; is only color and motion in a practically random
and significance-less pattern. With effort and practice, he is
able to interpret some of the visual data in terms of the world
as he has known it through his other senses, but he has immense
difficulty in learning these interpretations: they must be
repeated each time anew. For instance, visually he cannot tell
his dog from his cat. The instant he touches one or the other
however, its identity is obvious. Relating the visual data to the
touch is not retained however, for the next time he encounters
the animal visually, again he is lost. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Secondly, cognitive aspects of the habit routine
complexes are also lacking. This was illustrated by Virgil's
inability to see photographs and pictures as anything but random
if interestingly colored surfaces, even after he had been
practicing with his new vision for awhile. Along with previous
cases, he could not see people or objects in the pictures, even
after he had learned to recognize them in the flesh. He simply
did not comprehend the idea of representation for there were no
cognitive habit routines available which would allow and
facilitate such interpretation. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And thirdly, since all Virgil's existing habit
routines consisted of structures building upon his previously
available senses, (it had been remarked how his sense of touch
and smell were acute, and far more developed than in normal
persons), there was no possibility of intuitive or automatic
cross-modal association between his new vision and his
established cognitive schemes for understanding the world around
him. With a cane, he could walk up a stairway easily, yet the
vision of the same stairway gave no comprehension of its
three-dimensional structure and how one might navigate it. This,
in spite of knowing for certain that what was being viewed was
the same object that could be climbed with ease bytouch alone.
There were no cognitive habit routines enabling a connection
between the reality as perceived by the two sensory methods. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I refer the reader to Sack's description of
Virgil's symptoms (which one might call them in the sense that
they are the result of a deficit, in this case a deficit of habit
routines of perception and cognition necessary for the function
of meaningful vision). With the elaboration of each strange
effect, the habit routine interpretation is easily and
effectively summoned to organize and understand the situation as
a whole. In one sense, Virgil was in the situation of a young
child, trying to learn and establish the habit routines necessary
for interpreting a strange and colorful visual world around him.
Yet in another sense, since his brain and cognition had already
fully developed in other directions, taking account of his
deficit, he could not hope to achieve what the child does
effortlessly. In the young child, the entire cognitive structure
of habit routines is nascent and plastic; at fifty years of age
this structure is rigid, established, and not amenableto radical
change such as the sudden introduction of a new sensory pathway.
In such a case as Virgil's we can see that the total absence of
habit routines enabling the interpretation of vision renders the
visual sensation incomprehensible; visual data arriving in
thinking2 awareness without any organizing habit routine
structure results only in a profound and, in the end, often
tragic confusion which becomes a liability rather than a gift. </p>

<p><b>Perception of Language</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I believe it is difficult, if not practically
impossible in some situations, to experience raw sensory data; we
cannot avoid experiencing external reality in terms of our own
habit routines. Consider what happens when we hear someone speak
a few words. If the words are in a language which we ourselves
speak, they are immediately and unavoidably transformed into
meaning! Try studying some difficult subject while a conversation
is going on, or worse, an abusive TV advertisement is running. We
are practically incapable of hearing such auditory sensory data
as just noise, the meanings of the words keep attracting our
attention. But the meaning is not inherent in the sound! If the
language is not a familiar one, no meaning is produced! What is
the difference? We experience our own habit routines, as I have
stated, and when we hear auditory input which calls forth habit
routines of meaning, it is these habit routines which are
pre-emptively experienced, not the pure sound of the words. Even
for a foreign language, our habit routine search process is still
active (if less insistent), trying to pick out short successions
of syllables which might have a correlation to our own language,
in the attempt to get at least some fragmentary meaning out of
the noise. The point is, we are practically incapable of just
listening to speech as pure noise, the habit routine search
system simply overrides the will to do so. The habit routines
turn the sound of speech into meaning, automatically,
unavoidably. (Interestingly, in meditation, one practices the art
of &quot;quieting the internal dialog&quot;, of experiencing
reality without analyzing it, without attaching one's own
semantic interpretation to it. As I mentioned above, meditation
seems to be a method for suspending the significance and use of
habit routine in ongoing awareness.) </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now it is not conscious episodic memory, or LMA
which gives us the ability to understand language; we do not
actively recall the many instances in which we learned the
meanings of the words and their combinations. Yet the data that
was installed by these instances is certainly being used. For a
particular word I may perhaps be able to recall the event of
learning its meaning, but this is not what is used for present
understanding. Rather, the sum total of all instances in which
the meaning took on relevance for me is accessed (to continue
with the analogy of a film), asa collection of frames, by the
habit routine search process, and this collection of frames is
the habit routine called forth through which meaning is produced
in awareness. The fact that one can use a word in conversation
quite accurately, yet find it difficult to produce a satisfactory
definition of that word upon demand, illustrates the two
cognitive processes. Providing a definition requires LMA, (or at
least considerable conscious analysis of context to deduce what
the meaning must be), whereas the automatic use of a word in
proper and meaningful context is entirely controlled by the habit
routines generated in the thinking1 processes. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If it is easy to see how auditory input of
language results overpoweringly in the experience, not of the
pure sound, but of the <i>meaning of that sound,</i> (and hence
the habit routines which produce that meaning), I would ask the
reader to go back over my arguments concerning the other sensory
modalities. The experience of vision, for example, must be
parallel to audition of language: we do not experience the raw
sound, nor the raw visual scene, <i>but rather the meaning to
which we habitually attach that sensory input.</i> I cannot
stress enough, we experience what we have already experienced;
the view, if it has been stated in many contexts down through the
ages, now represents a new and radical paradigm shift for
understanding perception and psychology, for understanding
ourselves in a radically new and more complete way. </p>

<p><b>Illusions</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There are textbooks full of examples of visual,
cognitive, and even auditory illusions. How do they work? One of
my favorites, since I started playing around with a video camera
and learning how to control the &quot;white balance&quot; so as
to achieve accurate color representation in my films, is the Land
Effect, named after the inventor of the Polaroid Land Camera. The
absolute values of colors as perceived by a standard measuring
instrument, like the charge-coupled-device (CCD) in the video
camera, change radically according to the color balance or
temperature equivalent of the ambient illumination. As I film my
wife in the shade of a north-facing wall, thence to walk out into
full southern-exposure sunlight, the colors of her costume
undergo a radical metamorphosis in the final film, if I have not
correctly regulated the characteristics of the CCD of the camera,
the &quot;white-balance&quot;, in order to take account of the
change in illumination. If I film her in close-up, and set the
white balance to automatic, then the costume colors remain fairly
true to what we expect, but at a price: the background colors
change alarmingly. If I film her little walk from further away,
with the white balance locked to the setting which produces the
correct background, then it is the costume colors which change.
But as I observe the same scene with my normal vision, no
apparent metamorphosis takes place: blues are blue, reds are just
as red no matter where she walks, the background <i>and </i>the
costume are perceived without significant change even though the
color balance of light actually striking my retinae is changing
just as radically as it is at the surface of the CCD. Am I to
assume a &quot;white-balance&quot; feedback signal to my retinae,
adjusting their characteristics? There are no such neural
pathways in the brain. And any such regulation would not be
expected to correct for the costume <i>and</i> the background
simultaneously. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever mechanism is producing this color
constancy effect must therefore be in the brain itself, in the
processes of cognition, although some preprocessing of
&quot;data&quot; has been hypothesized to occur in the retinae of
the eyes. Edwin Land and other researchers of the effect have
come up with a mathematical model of how various nervous system
&quot;computations&quot; of intensity information from the entire
visual field might allow constancy of color perception, but I
suspect that mathematical computation theories of brain operation
are all, in some sense, artifacts which may have good predictive
power, but are not really good models for understanding what the
brain is actually doing. I, for one, am quite certain that my
brain is not calculating integrals or differential equations due
to its demonstrated failure to do so on my final
&quot;diffy&quot; examinations! Admittedly, due to the very
limited and tentative knowledge about the mind that the
neurosciences have so far been able to provide, mathematical
models may be all we have, in some cases. Computer analogies for
mind processes all suffer more or less from this same failing,
which is why I may (as noted previously) enclose &quot;data&quot;
and &quot;computations&quot; in quotes when discussing mind
processes. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Land's experimental findings can be summarized
by stating that the perceived color of an object in the visual
field does not depend solely on the color of light entering the
eye from that object, but on the entire spectrum of light
arriving from all locations in the visual field. The application
to the habit routine model of perception is obvious, I think. We
would say that the habit routines for the constant perception of
color values overrule to a large extent the actual signals
relayed by the retina. But if habit routines can counteract
actual color changes with such efficiency that we are not aware
that any correction is taking place, why then doesn't it happen
while I watch the curious effect in the film of the scene which
live, caused no such drastic change? Actually, I have noticed
that after watching such a distorted film many times, as when
editing it, that I do begin to get used to the odd change in
color values, and correct for it, or at least ignore it (which
might be practically equivalent). Such habit routines can and are
inevitably developed to some degree in artificial situations such
as the film editing, but are strong and well-developed for the
experiences of daily life situations since they have been
practiced and reinforced since early childhood. In agreement with
Land's theory, we do &quot;calculate&quot; the color of the
object perceived by comparison with the entire visual field. But
we do so through the use of habit routines which define what
colors to expect when we see sky, grass, stone wall, tree, etc.,
and such habit routine information is only weakly established, if
at all, when divorced from natural three-dimensional
surroundings, as in the case of watching the TV film. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There are parallel situations concerning the
perception of the constant size of objects. Some very interesting
illusions have been produced to confuse our nervous system's
ability to tell us the absolute size of an object in spite of the
wildly varying size of image projected on the retinae, if the
object is moving for example. Again, I believe we can improve
upon mathematical models of how size constancy is accomplished
with the habit routine model. Constancy is again produced from
the constancy of the habit routines in use by the perceptual
system. The habit routines <i>are</i> what is perceived. </p>

<p><b>A Cognitive Illusion</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another quite fascinating illusion that has been
around for quite some time was discovered by J.S. Bruner and Leo
Postman in 1949. <a name="back20"></a><a href="#footnote20">(20)</a>
I will quote Thomas Kuhn's account of the experiments for its
concision, and also because he raises a couple of interesting
points: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In a psychological experiment that deserves to be far
    better known outside the trade, Bruner and Postman asked
    experimental subjects to identify on short and controlled
    exposure a series of playing cards. Many of the cards were
    normal, but some were made anomalous, e.g., a red six of
    spades and a black four of hearts. Each experimental run was
    constituted by the display of a single card to a single
    subject in a series of gradually increased exposures. After
    each exposure the subject was asked what he had seen, and the
    run was terminated by two successive correct identifications.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Even on the shortest exposures many subjects identified
    most of the cards, and after a small increase all the
    subjects identified them all. For the normal cards these
    identifications were usually correct, but the anomalous cards
    were almost always identified, without apparent hesitation or
    puzzlement, as normal. The black four of hearts might, for
    example, be identified as the four of either spades or
    hearts. Without any awareness of trouble, it was immediately
    fitted to one of the conceptual categories prepared by prior
    experience. <i>One would not even like to say that the
    subjects had seen something different from what they
    identified</i>. With a further increase of exposure to the
    anomalous cards, subjects did begin to hesitate and to
    display awareness of anomaly. Exposed, for example, to the
    red six of spades, some would say: That's the six of spades,
    but there's something wrong with it-the black has a red
    border. Further increase of exposure resulted in still more
    hesitation and confusion until finally, and sometimes quite
    suddenly, most subjects would produce the correct
    identification without hesitation. <i>Moreover, after doing
    this with two or three of the anomalous cards, they would
    have little further difficulty with the others</i>. A few
    subjects, however, were never able to make the requisite
    adjustment of their categories. Even at forty times the
    average exposure required to recognize normal cards for what
    they were, more than 10 per cent of the anomalous cards were
    not correctly identified. And the subjects who then failed
    often experienced acute personal distress. One of them
    exclaimed: &quot;I can't make the suit out, whatever it is.
    It didn't even look like a card that time. I don't know what
    color it is now or whether it's a spade or a heart. I'm not
    even sure now what a spade looks like. My God!&quot;...
    [italics added]. <a name="back21"></a><a href="#footnote21">(21)</a>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The first italicized sentence raises the
question of what kind of illusion is actually happening here. The
reaction to the anomalous card is so automatic and reliable that
one is tempted to say that it is a <i>perceptual</i> illusion
taking place, that the subject actually perceives the anomalous
card <i>as </i>a normal card. But unlike many perceptual
illusions, in which the illusion persists even when knowledge of
deception is gained, here, as shown by the second of the
italicized sentences, the illusion tends to disappear after the
trick is discovered. It seems therefore that the illusion is
cognitive, having to do with the analysis or evaluation of
perception rather than perception itself. A perceptual illusion
may rely on habit routines that are fundamental to the
functioning of the perceptual system they involve, and thus be
very difficult to counteract. An example would be the now famous
line drawing which can be seen alternately as a vase, or as two
faces in profile, but never both simultaneously. <a name="back22"></a><a
href="#footnote22">(22)</a> An illusion depending on the analysis
or higher processing of perception, as I believe the anomalous
card trick shows, can be overcome almost immediately <i>by the
installation of new or modified habit routines via working
memory, </i>which are supplied as parameters for further habit
routine search which then takes into account the new data that
anomalous cards are likely to be presented. It would be
interesting to know more about the few persons mentioned in the
experiment who had difficulty seeing through the trick even after
they knew about it. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At this point it might be useful to recall my
view in the last chapter that at least two different categories
for habit routines are postulated, although since a habit routine
is a composite of data from many sources, in multiple sensory and
cognitive domains, the categories will certainly overlap or be
simultaneously applicable in some situations. But as far as it is
useful, we may refer to habits of <i>perception</i>, and habits
of <i>cognition</i>. The latter will be understood as the habit
routines which are used for analytical and reasoning tasks, or
the production of meaning from language as discussed above, while
the former produce such things as the visual illusions mentioned.
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have suggested the term habit routine complex
to denote that the unitary habit routine which is constantly
constructed and presented to the awareness of thinking2 consists
of all these types or aspects simultaneously. Thus if we can
usefully isolate a part of an overall habit routine and see it as
a habit of cognition, or a personality trait, such a dissection
will be only a theoretical operation for heuristic purposes. The
actual habit routine complex is an entity constructed from all
levels of brain/mind operation from simple perceptual tasks to
complex intuitive, deductive and associational processes such as
the expression of personality. </p>

<p><b>Personality as Habit Routine</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very existence of strong, purportedly
inalterable &quot;personality traits&quot; seems to me a perfect
illustration of the prevalence and importance of habit routines
in producing the range of reactions to the daily life process. As
with the language example above, we do not use LMA to consciously
search our memories for the data revealing how to act in a
typical situation, consistent with our established
&quot;personality&quot;. We react typically, but automatically to
certain situations, if not practically all situations, as an
observer who knows us well will attest. Others know us by our
personality, which when seemingly a bit different due to unusual
troubles or a very bad mood, will invite sincere inquiries of
&quot;what's wrong? You're not <i>yourself</i> today!&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; People who know us certainly do not expect
radical or even moderate personality change from meeting to
meeting; if encountered, someone will surely recommend a few
sessions on the couch, or medication. The most startling and
tragic event of diseases like Alzheimer's is perhaps not the
gradual loss of memory and function, but the loss and/or change
of <i>personality</i> which accompanies the disease. For the
family relative who loved the person as expressed through <i>personality</i>,
we may hear the lament, &quot;he's just not <i>himself</i>
anymore.&quot; What could the personality be, if not a large
collection of routines suitable for automatic use; what data
could personality arise from if not the very same data from which
we extract conscious memories, yet accessed in an unconscious,
rapid and automatic fashion by a cognitive/brain system not under
conscious, analytic and deliberative control? The
thinking1/thinking2 model outlined in the previous chapter is a
far more descriptive and operational framework than simply saying
that personality is a property of the &quot;unconscious
mind,&quot; as if there were some separate compartment, some
independent source of data wholly other, completely independent
of the conscious mind. <i>It is the same data</i>. It is the
method of use and the neurophysiology of access which is
different. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Cognitive illusions and intellectual traps are
more difficult to explain than visual illusions, no matter what
the theoretical model. But why shouldn't our opinions and
beliefs, our prejudices and expectations, our ideas about
reality, our personal metaphysical outlook, the very patterns we
use to evaluate what we believe to be truth or lies, also be not
only governed by habit routines, but actually be identical with
habit routines modified only slightly, in the ongoing perceived
normality of daily existence, by the precise monitoring of one's
present intellectual intentions? I don't deny that extensive
self-evaluation ever takes place, but in most individuals it may
take a life-crisis to stimulate it, while the creative genius and
artist may dwell there frequently. But since we all need to swim
in <i>some</i> kind of water, the normal everyday joe has
practically no awareness of his habit routines, and the artist
little realization that partial immunity to habit routines is his
own peculiar suspension medium. But if cognitive, evaluative
aspects of habit routines are as important as we see the visual
ones to be, psychiatry may be a far more primitive endeavor than
had been suspected even by the pessimistic. </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As so often happens when one invents a model, or
attacks some problem with a new way of thinking, a search of the
literature reveals that someone has already covered the territory
and proposed something very similar. But the habit routine model
is itself applicable here: in having re-invented the idea from a
new perspective, without having previously been acquainted with
older work, I may have avoided falling into certain traps or
habit routines that the original work would have installed in the
process of learning it. Thus I discovered, long after coming up
with the idea of habit routine suspension as the mechanism of
psychedelic experience, that Sir Frederick Bartlett in 1932 had
proposed that memory and learning were represented in the mind by
being embedded in large scale structures which he called <i>schemas
</i>or <i>schemata</i>, &quot;...an active organization of past
reactions, or of past experiences, which must always be supposed
to be operating in any well-adapted organic response&quot;. <a
name="back23"></a><a href="#footnote23">(23)</a> But in having
developed my own approach first, I arrived at a view of the
function of schemas, or habit routines in my terminology, which
attributes to them a more fundamental and primary importance than
even recent developments of schema theory imply. Daniel Schacter
notes that, &quot;Although Bartlett's notion of a schema is
rather fuzzy..., and his experimental results have not proved
easy to replicate..., his approach has exerted a strong
theoretical and experimental influence on cognitive research...
Mandler...provides a useful summary of the cognitive conception
of a schema: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . [a schema] is a spatially and/or temporally
    organized structure in which the parts are connected on the
    basis of contiguities that have been experienced in space or
    time. A schema is formed on the basis of past experience with
    objects, scenes, or events and consists of a set of (usually
    unconscious) expectations about what things look like and/or
    the order in which they occur. The parts, or units, of a
    schema consist of a set of variables, or slots, which can be
    filled, or instantiated, in any given instance by values that
    have greater or lesser degrees of probability of occurrence
    attached to them. Schemata vary greatly in their degree of
    generality-the more general the schema, the less specified,
    or the less predictable, are the values that may satisfy
    them. <a name="back24"></a><a href="#footnote24">(24)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Baddeley summarizes the characteristics of
schemas shared by the various recent interpretations of schema
theory. The parallels to my own idea of habit routines will be
obvious, but I shall presently point out the important
differences in the two conceptions. (Baddeley is here summarizing
a paper by Rumelhart &amp; Norman): </p>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>Schemas have Variables</b> <br>
    Schemas are packets of information that comprise a fixed core
    and a variable aspect... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>Schemas can Embed One Within Another </b><br>
    Schemas are not mutually exclusive packages of information,
    but can be nested... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>Schemas Represent Knowledge at all Levels of
    Abstraction </b><br>
    The concept of schema is broadly applicable, from abstract
    ideologies and concepts such as justice, to very concrete
    schema such as that for the appearance of a face. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>Schemas Represent Knowledge Rather than Definitions </b><br>
    Schemas comprise the knowledge and experience that we have of
    the world, they do not consist of abstract rules. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <b><p>Schemas are Active Recognition Devices </b><br>
    This is very reminiscent of Bartlett's original emphasis on
    effort after meaning. <a name="back25"></a><a
    href="#footnote25">(25)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With a little editing, both of these sets of
characteristics could be used to define the nature of habit
routines. I have in fact learned much about what I expect of
habit routines from a study of modern research on schemas. But
there is a fundamental difference between the two concepts.
Schemas were hypothesized as hierarchical structures <i>resident
in</i> the mind/brain which provided an organized template on
which knowledge and memory was stored, as well as for the
incorporation of new knowledge or learning. Habit routines, by
contrast, do not have any independent or <i>inherent </i>existence
until they are called up, actually <i>manufactured and assembled</i>
from LTM data by brain systems which I shall define in the next
chapter. Although in speaking of habit routines, I continually
refer to them being accessed or called-up for use, the
terminology is only a convenience, for I do not wish to imply
that habit routines have any independent <i>a priori</i>
existence in the storage medium of the brain, which stores only
the frames of memory; a habit routine is <i>constructed</i>, in
my view, each time anew as required by the current ongoing
cognitive state. HRS is thus a process of reconstruction rather
than something akin to looking up a reference in a library. Also,
it must be remembered that Attention does not <i>refer back to</i>
habit routines after having received sensory information in need
of organization. Quite the contrary, for the information which is
at any moment available for Attention has already been
constructed from habit routine data via unconscious thinking1
processes. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, much of the research that has been
conducted in the effort to illustrate the characteristics of
schemas has used language oriented material in the experimental
tests. The accuracy of memory in the recall of stories recounted
to subjects was studied, for example, to explore how the learning
of the story was superimposed upon schemas about typical aspects
of stories in general. But since I have proposed that language is
itself only a resonance to thinking1/2 processes,
(symbolization), occurring well after and only in reaction to
habit routine search and resulting thinking2 processes of
checking, analysis, and so on, then of necessity habit routines
do not themselves exist in terms of linguistic structures.
Language itself is not what is stored in LTM, although the means
(the data for the construction of habit routines) to produce or
reconstruct it most certainly are. I have proposed that the HRS
process is one of the earliest to have been evolved in the animal
nervous system, and this would certainly not agree with the
hypothesis that the data of habit routines was stored in terms of
language (an error and abuse-prone, add-on option only available
on the very latest models of animal life!) The study of the
manifestation of habit routines through experiments utilizing
language therefore misses their essential character. If we can
observe the effects of habit routines through the study of
symbolization processes we must not overlook the fact that we are
not eliciting the properties of habit routines themselves, only
their effect upon subsequent mental events. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; An argument of economy supports the contention
that habit routines are constructed rather than accessed <i>in
situ</i>. If schemas or habit routines existed already structured
in LTM, then a particular important bit of information that
related to many different habit routines would have to be stored
in many different ways, redundantly, in order to be present in
the very many habit routine structures requiring it. If the habit
routine is manufactured afresh each time it is needed, the bit of
information need only be stored once. This is an
oversimplification however, since it is debatable whether the
storage of &quot;data&quot; in the brain can be conceived of on
the computer model of the storage of &quot;bits&quot; or
&quot;bytes&quot; of &quot;data&quot;. Nevertheless I still
believe the argument of economy above is significant.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My belated discovery of schema theory as such a
close fit to my own model was in one sense a disappointment. It
is always gratifying to believe that one's work has originality.
But I also found an encouragement: If I had proposed the habit
routine model of cognition as a deduction from observations of
the effect of psychedelic drugs, (and in this I was sure to have
many, many critics), yet the model proposed had so many
similarities to a theory which &quot;has exerted a strong
theoretical and experimental influence on cognitive
research&quot; in Schacter's words, then my ideas about
psychedelic experience might not be too far off the mark. I had
arrived at a theoretical viewpoint from my study of psychedelic
experience which replicated current thinking in cognitive
science, about which I had studied very little. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope I have been able to convey the cognitive
nature of habit routines as I understand them. If
&quot;Bartlett's notion of a schema is rather fuzzy&quot;, I
expect that it will also be said that my own notion of habit
routines is also somewhat nebulous. But the same could be said of
many current theoretical approaches to the working of the human
mind. The controversies and radically opposed paradigms in this
endeavor are a sure sign that our knowledge is yet primitive and
introductory, but also that a fruitful and rapid evolution of
understanding is imminent. In this chapter I have tried
therefore, not to propose a precise definition of what a habit
routine may be, but rather to illustrate some of the things it <i>may</i>
be in relation to several known phenomena. I am intentionally
leaving the concept of a habit routine open to further
development and more precise elaboration. If the habit routine
search and suspension model is in fact useful and widely
applicable, it will take more time and better minds than mine to
develop the idea satisfactorily. It is an ongoing effort on my
part to study the great volume of theories, models, opinions,
data and sheer speculation that has been advanced in the very
difficult task of understanding the human mind and how it works,
but professionals in this field who spend their lifetimes in the
universities and laboratories are far better equipped than I to
continue this work. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Necessarily, I have omitted mention of many
research studies about phenomena which seem to fit well with my
model, but which would have overly encumbered the present text to
describe. If at the end of the last chapter I mentioned the risk
of seeing habit routines everywhere, the reader will now see
that, if they are not omnipresent, my model at least intimates
that they are pervasive in a way that has not at all been
suspected in theories of the operation of mind/brain. I believe
that habit routines are fundamental, that HRS is the primary
cognitive operation of the brain/mind, coming before and
providing the very structure for the operations of mind of which
we have everyday awareness; and very importantly, due to these
characteristics, that <i>the HRS process is greatly obscured by
its own operation</i>. Only in the modification of its operation
(gradual and unsurprising in the case of meditation, for example,
radical and unmistakable in the case of psychedelic experience),
can we even suspect its existence, and attempt to understand its
characteristics and functions. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the next chapter I will attempt to postulate
neurological mechanisms of the brain which might be associated
with the formation, use, and modification of habit routines, as
well as some of the other functions of mind that I have
discussed. Due to the present state of our knowledge of the
nervous system, my attempt will certainly be fraught with error,
not least because my own knowledge of neuroscience is
self-taught, and only (so far) a year in the making. But I
thought it would be useful to at least define some neurological
possibilities for the habit routine model, and it has been quite
alot of fun to do so. If professional neuroscientists will find
it child's play to show where I have erred, I would ask their
indulgence to suggest better neurological models rather than use
my admitted status as a novice to reject the whole theory of
psychedelic experience. In the act of too facile a dismissal of
the new ideas, (as has repeatedly happened in the history of
science), they might in the present case be providing evidence
for the very theory they are rejecting out-of-hand! </p>

<h2>5.&nbsp; Neuromechanics &#151; The Minefield </h2>
</center>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Proposing a reasonable neurological model for
the operation of the habit routine search process is not the
first minefield that I have had to navigate. Back in the U.S.A.
it seemed a straightforward thing to continue the research which
so few seemed to have the motivation for; several people had
offered varying degrees of support for such projects, but as I
mentioned previously, motivations are a funny thing. My own
seemed at the time to be relatively uncomplicated, and in
retrospect, although I may tend to tidy up my autobiographical
act with a few convenient omissions and over-telling of some of
the high points, <i>je ne regrette rien.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Coincidences, mysteries, personal lessons, and
strange experiences of the most diverse character, as significant
and soul-searching as the Mexican earthquake experience,
continued with a very suspicious frequency. I have previously
mentioned my ability to bear up under the influence of any drug
or shamanic potion, and I sometimes found this ability of even
greater value in dealing with the people and day-to-day events
playing a part in the unfolding of my work. The idea that the
shaman himself must deal with forces and destinies on a far more
fundamental level than the members of his tribe is, of course,
the very spirit and tradition of shamanism. If powerful
psychedelic experiences were to benefit members of the tribe, the
shaman must have already explored the same territory, and gone
well beyond to the very limits of his abilities. In the present
case where the shaman not only administers the powerful
medicines, but actually creates them with the tools of modern
science, his knowledge and intentions are perhaps even more
important. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, in the case of what turned out in some
ways to be a rather successful collaboration between myself and a
trio of avowedly enthusiastic partners, the passage of time and
the achievement of some degree of success seemed to distort the
relations between us in a way very reminiscent of a kind of
vicious parody of the psychedelic experience itself. Meetings and
discussions of plans and goals at first were nothing less than
inspiring. Between us we had the connections and ability to
obtain the necessary raw materials, manufacture a high-quality
product, and distribute it in such a way that it would reach the
right people. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We certainly did not advocate or intend any sort
of mass distribution of psychedelics resulting in their misuse or
ignorant use, which would only call attention to a situation
easily besmirched by adverse publicity. Sensational,
fear-mongering publicity had already made it much more difficult
to properly initiate or introduce a newcomer to the psychedelic
experience. There was certainly a case to be made that many
negative experiences were a direct result of the adverse
publicity itself, for in the early, pre-publicity days of
psychedelic research, &quot;bad trips&quot; were a rarity, even
among alcoholics and psychiatric patients. With normal research
volunteers, the statistics noted by the many researchers
indicated the astonishing <i>safety </i>of psychedelic drugs, not
risk. Now the publicity made it seem that, although an Aldous
Huxley or Alan Watts might get through a psychedelic experience
unscathed, the normal member of society should realize that the
potential risk was overwhelming. And this kind of official
attitude weighed heavily on the person interested to undergo an
experience: even if such a view could in principle be seen for
the hysterical, prohibitionist, puritanical mindset that it in
reality was, the slightest lingering doubt had the possibility to
poison a person's trust in himself and his shaman. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is perhaps easier to see demons where there
are none to be found. And if demons <i>are</i> encountered, the
idea that they are exterior, real, and <i>caused</i> by something
other than oneself is certainly not conducive to understanding
their meaning. As the Habit Routine Suspension model
demonstrates, the psychedelic experience is no roll of
science-fiction film projected upon consciousness from the
outside. If demons are encountered, they are in reality our
everyday friends seen without the normal range of categorizations
which render them ordinary and insignificant. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The demons which appeared to disrupt our
successful enterprise were therefore more real than those of the
imagination. I can only suspect a hidden agenda on the part of my
co-workers, but the nature of their intentions at the end was so
at odds with the honest enthusiasm of the beginning that I
suspect that the hidden motivations must have developed over
time. From the original enthusiasm there seemed finally to have
evolved a plan to demonstrate once and for all that the
psychedelic experience was, in fact, illegitimate, or at least
unnecessary, its insights illusory, its history merely primitive
self-delusion. To arrive at the establishment reactionary
position through first having professed a more universal and
enlightened view seemed to me altogether impossible. This demon <i>was
</i>real. And what was I going to do about it? </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The final scene was quite surreal. The night
before, one of my partners presented me with a five-hundred
dollar banknote, subtly making sure that I noticed the portrait
on the face of the bill, that of the &quot;assassinated
leader&quot;, William McKinley, twenty-fifth president of the
United States. At most, I felt only the slightest premonition of
the events the next day would bring, for which we were planning a
day of skiing, and restaurant to follow. Whether the banknote,
and perhaps other similar but unrecognized intimations were
apparent I do not remember, but in the morning I decided to take
a small dose of LSD, to appreciate a day in the high snowy
mountains from a different perspective. In retrospect, I find
that I instinctively tended to undergo a psychedelic experience
at points in my life where a certain crossroads was about to be
reached, when perhaps only vaguely realized intimations of
important changes to come had appeared. Without fail, the
experience would precipitate whatever it was that was pending,
and ignite the insight and decision that would usher in a new
direction. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My friends were newcomers to skiing, and I had
promised to help them get their sea-legs, so to speak. Upon
arriving, I sent them off to the rental shop to secure their
equipment, and I took a test-run on the nearest slope. It was
exhilarating! Although there was quite a crowd that day, the
scene was magnificent. Arriving at base, my friends had not yet
reappeared, so I continued on up again to the irresistible
heights. The next time down the crowd was getting thick enough to
make locating my friends problematic, and in my present state of
exhilaration I couldn't begin to devise a sure-fire method for
finding them. I had to assume that, although our original plan
seemed to be going astray, they would nevertheless have suited up
and found some incidental help with their first few glides on
skis. After a few more runs I began to feel, in contrast to my
exhilaration, a gnawing guilt that I had ignored my friends, even
if through a concurrence of events which I could not have
foreseen. The LSD experience, despite the very modest dose that I
had taken, was attaining a peak more spectacular (in more ways
than one) than those amongst which I was gliding. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly my friends appeared, and I knew that my
neglect had ruined their day. But the intensity of my feelings,
and their reaction as well, seemed all out of proportion to the
reality of the situation. There was far more significance afoot
than a simple evaluation of the day's events would warrant. My
apologies, and their subdued yet somehow exaggerated insistence
that it didn't really matter, were a mere facade for the emotion
that was all too evident in just a glance. Somehow aspects of the
entire relationship in our joint involvement in the psychedelic
project were metaphorically represented here, and they were
threatening a tumultuous final act upon the stage whose players
had to date seemed so reassuringly without calculation or
subterfuge. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The situation while driving back continued to
intensify. I began to see through the cracks in reality, the
physical manifestations of which became more and more a flimsy
veil affording less and less protection against immediate
dissolution into the hidden dimensions beyond. If my friends were
worried about my driving on the slippery roads, I think that they
too must have sensed, more importantly, that loyalties and
intentions concerning our collective enterprise was the real
issue that was coming to a head. At the restaurant, under the
influence of good food and wine and associated conversation, the
electricity subsided somewhat, and it seemed that things might be
patched up with a resulting return to a situation that we all now
realized had more of deception than honesty. If we could return
to business as usual, we all now knew that on a more fundamental
level, all was changed. This is not, and never has been, a
situation from which effective shamanism can work its benefits to
the full. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Later at their house, in front of a warm
log-fire, I continued to ponder on this last point. So far,
absolutely nothing explicit had actually been discussed
concerning the impending crisis that we each knew to be imminent.
An outsider could not have detected that anything more than the
superficial was transpiring, yet in each others' presence, a mere
glance was like a trumpet fanfare announcing major discoveries
about a hidden side of our co-involvement. It must have been past
midnight when in walked partner number three, whom I had seen
only a few times. He lived quite far away, and I was surprised to
see him at this late hour, but the others apparently had expected
his arrival. After some lengthy and private discussion in the
kitchen, they reappeared, and, very tentatively at first, began
to suggest to me a most surprising plan. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I had recently been working on some advanced
techniques for making our product in a more purified form, and
had been meditating about my experiments probably as a way to
suspend thinking about the more serious implications of the day's
events. At my partners' first mention of LSD I immediately
launched into an attempted discussion of my recent experiments,
perhaps also hoping to repair the situation: At every stage of my
work it was of primary importance to me to be able to continue,
even if this involved having people associated with the project
who neither knew nor cared about the larger implications. If a
partner was interested in nothing but the cash-flow, for example,
I tried to cope with the deficit temporarily until something
better presented itself. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But something was seriously wrong here. One of
my partners was now saying to me that he didn't like the effect
of LSD, it seemed dirty to him, made him sick rather than giving
him inspiration. Despite the day's events and the suspicions that
had been aroused I was quite shocked, and speechless. Gradually
the hidden agenda was presented: what I was to do, was to prepare
a large batch of placebos. Make up what I would say was a batch
of the purest LSD that had ever been made, give them away free to
all my contacts for distribution, and pass along the message that
everyone was to wait until the vernal equinox, then take the new
psychedelic together. The trick was, they would be entirely
inactive, blank doses with nothing but an implied message from...
Yes, from whom? Who was the author of this message? Was this idea
a brainstorm of my partners, suddenly having seen a vision that
drugs were the tools of the devil? The apparent honesty of our
relationship so far in contrast to the way that the plan was
presented, and the things that were said that night, including
the implied threats (the McKinley banknote was burning in my
pocket), and also the implied promises of new and greater
projects and responsibilities for me if I could only see the
wisdom of this plan, made it plain to me that the tiger I had by
the tail was rather larger than I had heretofore suspected. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, the activation of my consciousness by the
dose I had taken, and these astounding changes of identity made
manifest that day, made the indoctrination as effective as a
lengthy torture and brainwash session in North Korea. I quite
forced myself to believe the idea had some merit, and for the
next few days, more than half-heartedly prepared a large batch of
chocolate covered placebos in line with the master plan. The
chocolate coating was to prevent anyone examining the underlying
substrate and possibly suspecting that there was less than meets
the eye about this plan for a glorious first-day-of-spring
celebration. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I carried through with the lie to the bitter
end, I don't think there were any suspicions, and I myself
boarded a train for the Grand Canyon to be (1)out of reach when
the chocolate hit the fans and (2)in a nice spot in case of the
highly unlikely event that the Millennium was actually going to
begin that day. It didn't, and the feedback from the experiment
was less than respectful. My former partners disappeared from the
scene to cope with more petty problems and new coincidences
materialized out of nowhere to enable the next stage of my
ongoing quest.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is an old Negro Spiritual that was in the
1940's made into a &quot;Jazz Soundie&quot;, the equivalent of
today's rock video as seen on MTV. I have a wonderful 3-minute
version of &quot;Dem Bones&quot; by the Delta Rhythm Boys, sung
in close four-part harmony; it starts with the refrain, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Ezekiel connected
    dem...DRY BONES, </i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Referring of course to Chapter 37 of the Old
Testament Book of Ezekiel in which the prophet is commanded to
&quot;Prophesy upon these bones: and say unto them, O ye dry
bones, hear the word of the Lord.&quot; Whereupon, as in the
refrain of the song, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Oh, de toe bone connected
    to de...FOOT BONE, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; De foot bone connected to
    de...HEEL BONE, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; De heel bone connected to
    de...ANKLE BONE, </i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And so on up to &quot;de HEAD BONE&quot;. I
hadn't watched my collection of &quot;Soundies&quot; in quite
some time, but humming in the shower late one night, meditating
on my recent neurological studies and lack of satisfaction of
their power to explain processes of mind except in a very
rudimentary manner, the tune suddenly popped into my headbone. It
occurred to me that current neuromechanical models of how the
collection of parts in the brain is supposed to produce mind,
behavior, thinking and perception, was very much a Dry Bones
Model of Neuromechanics. (Substituting brain part names into the
song quite ruins the rhythm however: de caudate nucleus connected
to de...CEREBELLUM, de locus coeruleus connected to de...ANTERIOR
CINGULATE GYRUS, you get the point.) </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The textbooks carefully told the student what
was connected to what, and suggested sometimes that a particular
part &quot;was thought to be involved in&quot; some function or
other. And to my further dissatisfaction, slowly compiling again
and again my own map of brain connections, my studies had
revealed that practically every brain part was connected to every
other brain part: each brain map I plotted quite soon became
filled up with arrows, and quite useless. It seemed that
mainstream neuroscience, in spite of its great and rapidly
increasing wealth of assuredly precise data, had little to say
about the functions of all these parts on a systems level;
understanding how to get to psychology from neurology, how to get
mind out of brain, was still at the level of expecting dry bones
to suddenly, as the song's second verse goes, after &quot;dem
bones&quot; have been connected, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Dem bones, dem bones
    gonna'...WALK AROUN'... </i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The neuroscientists, without such divine
intervention as Ezekiel had access to, simply were not able to
show decisively how connections of the nervous system could
produce even simple psychology, much less consciousness itself.
My own efforts to suggest brain systems and connections that
might allow the operation of the habit routine search cognitive
process would therefore be no less tentative and imprecise,
certainly due for major revisions as new evidence was discovered.
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the case of memory, so fundamentally
important to everyday life and to the operation of my proposed
habit routine system, it is therefore still very much a matter of
debate as to how information is stored in or associated with the
properties of the neurons in the central nervous system. The
&quot;data&quot; representing the various types of memory,
including habit routines, must in some sense be &quot;in the
brain&quot; and by extrapolation must somehow be associated with
the properties of neurons and their connections, but the wide
diversity between current theoretical viewpoints illustrates more
our lack of precise knowledge than an emerging paradigm. Perhaps
the most popular model of information storage at present is that
of the adjustment and long-term maintenance of the strengths of
the connections between neurons. This is supposed to occur by the
modification of the neuron's synapses, the junctions by which
neurons communicate using chemical neurotransmitters. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This &quot;neural network&quot; or
&quot;synaptic weight&quot; model lends itself to ready
simulation on a computer and is probably on one end of a scale
ranging from extreme reductionism, to another extreme which
reductionists usually brand as mysticism. An example would be the
ideas about memory advanced by Rupert Sheldrake, that the actual
memory information is resident in some quasi-independent memory<i>
field</i> which may allow such phenomena as telepathy, apparent
reincarnation and so forth, the physical brain being merely the
sender-receiver of memory to the common field by a process of
morphic resonance. <a name="back1"></a><a href="#footnote1">(1)</a>
In looking at the broad range of sometimes very enigmatic
properties of memory, and the admitted uncertainty and disparity
of views by the experts, no model should be routinely dismissed
if it has any explanatory power whatsoever. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The synaptic-weight model probably owes its
status to the power and success of computer science, the enormous
investments and hence large number of talented scientists working
therein providing a momentum of opinion which may unduly limit
the credibility of other well-constructed but competing models.
It cannot be denied that very impressive mathematical models and
computer simulations of &quot;intelligence&quot; have been
demonstrated, and shown to have similarities to the ways in which
we believe human intelligence to operate. It has also been well
demonstrated that synapses between neurons (as well as the size
and connectivity of the neurons themselves) can and do change
their characteristics for varying lengths of time under the
influence of learning processes. The power and sophistication of
neural network models (see for example descriptions of the
operation of the Hopfield Network as a mechanism for the
storage/retrieval of information)<a name="back2"></a> <a
href="#footnote2">(2)</a> are certainly impressive. The
fundamental question which remains to be resolved, however, is
whether the brain works anything like a computer. There is
currently raging a most entertaining debate on this subject, some
of the most powerful intellects of our time are joining the
battle, (see, among others, works by Churchland, Claxton, Crick,
Dennett, Edelman, Flanagan, Fodor, Freeman, Gazzaniga,
Hofstadter, Humphrey, McGinn, Penrose, Searle, Tallis, Tulving,
the list is so long there is no recourse but to leave out mention
of many more. Some titles are listed in the Bibliography). </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Steven Rose, himself a veteran of many years of
research attempting to identify brain sites involved with storage
of <i>engrams</i> or memory traces, has recently summarized
criticism of the computer-like, information-processing model of
brain operation. <a name="back3"></a><a href="#footnote3">(3)</a>
Particularly of interest, as Rose points out, is a critique by
the neurophysiologist Walter Freeman, for it is solidly based on
research findings: Freeman insists that, although changes to
various individual neurons can be observed to happen as a result
of learning, the &quot;information&quot; that is learned does not
subsequently exist as &quot;bits of data&quot; recorded in these
neurons (the computer paradigm). Rather, the memories of the
learning exist as fluctuating dynamic patterns of electrical
activity generated by the <i>entire brain.</i> As Rose puts it, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[The] experiments say that it, the engram, is not confined
    to a single brain region. But I want to go further than this,
    and to argue that in an important sense the memory is not
    confined to a small set of neurons at all, but has to be
    understood as a property of the entire brain, even the entire
    organism. <a name="back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">(4)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; An intriguing suggestion has been that the
storage of information in the brain is analogous to the storage
of information in a hologram, a model which was first developed
by the neurosurgeon Karl Pribram in the 1960's. <a name="back5"></a><a
href="#footnote5">(5)</a> The idea that brain activity might be
non-local, a process of the generation of distributed waves of
activity which interact to form interference patterns, had been
suggested in 1942 by Karl Lashley, whose pioneering research on
the brain had inspired Pribram during their collaboration at
Yerkes Laboratories. Freeman's experimental findings, as well as
the observations of Steven Rose above, are exactly what one would
expect from a brain operating on holographic principles. The view
of memories existing as &quot;fluctuating dynamic patterns of
electrical activity generated by the <i>entire brain&quot;, could
not embody holographic principles more strongly.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Although criticism of the so-called holographic
paradigm has come from many directions, the parallels between the
mathematical and physical facts of optical holography and many
known properties of memory and the brain suggest that further
research will tend to support rather than discredit the model. In
a recent paper Pribram elaborates on some of these parallels: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The following properties of holograms are important for
    brain function: (1) the distribution and parallel
    content-addressable processing of information &#151; a
    characteristic that can account for the failure of brain
    lesions to eradicate any specific memory trace (or engram);
    (2) the tremendous storage capacity of the holographic domain
    and the ease with which information can be retrieved (the
    entire contents of the Library of Congress can currently be
    stored on holofische, or microfilm recorded in holographic
    form, taking up no more space than is contained in an attache
    case); (3) the capacity for associative recall that is
    inherent in the parallel distributed processing of holograms
    because of the coupling of separate inputs; and (4) the
    provision by this coupling of a powerful technique for
    correlating (cross-correlations and autocorrelations are
    accomplished almost instantaneously). <a name="back6"></a><a
    href="#footnote6">(6)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a curious fact of the history of
neuroscience that Pribram's work during the 1960's and 1970's was
almost unanimously rejected by the mainstream: he was for two
decades practically the only proponent of the theory of
distributed representation of memory (distributed coding) in the
brain. At the time, nearly all theoretical work leaned strongly
toward the assumption of detector-cell coding, <a name="back7"></a><a
href="#footnote7">(7)</a> a model strictly analogous to computer,
bit-storage processes, with a precise location in the machine
being responsible for the storage of a uniquely defined unit of
information. Today the mainstream neuroscientists have taken the
opposite tack: distributed processing and storage is their
byword, yet Pribram's holonomic theory is still widely rejected,
even though in an important sense it is part of the foundation of
recent theory. Francis Crick's assessment is typical: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This analogy between the brain and a hologram has often
    been enthusiastically embraced by those who know rather
    little about either subject. It is almost certainly
    unrewarding, for two reasons. A detailed mathematical
    analysis has shown that neural networks and holograms are
    mathematically distinct. More to the point, although
    [artificial] neural networks are built from units that have
    some resemblance to real neurons, there is no trace in the
    brain of the apparatus or processes required for holograms. <a
    name="back8"></a><a href="#footnote8">(8)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To state that neurosurgeon Pribram and his
recent mathematician colleagues &quot;know rather little about
either subject&quot; is a bit stiff, and the observation that
there don't seem to be any lasers or such holographic equipment
in the brain itself demonstrates ignorance of the two subjects.
Pribram counters such criticism with the warning, &quot;It is
important to realize that holography is a mathematical invention
and that its realization in optical systems...is only one product
of this branch of mathematics.&quot; In other words, optical
holography is merely a special case of a wider and more
fundamental process for the encoding and reconstitution of
information. For this reason it was suggested that the term <i>holonomic</i>
<a name="back9"></a><a href="#footnote9">(9)</a> be used in
reference to brain/mind properties, a term I shall adopt here.
The term holonomic as used in physics, also indicates that the
process is not a static, frozen-in-time representation as is a
hologram, but a dynamic, continuous one. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Further rebuttal, including a short history of
the criticism of the holonomic theory can be found in a recent
paper by Pribram and his colleagues. <a name="back10"></a><a
href="#footnote10">(10)</a> The most recent and complete
exposition of holonomic theory is presented in a book covering
the 1986 John M. MacEachran Memorial Lecture, <a name="back11"></a><a
href="#footnote11">(11)</a> delivered by Pribram. The book
demonstrates that the holonomic theory has progressed both
conceptually and mathematically far beyond its introductory
position of the 1960's; it is the original and necessarily
simplistic exposition of the theory which is still attacked by
the critics of today who remark (along with other trivial
complaints) that &quot;there don't seem to be any lasers in the
brain&quot;. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Other criticism of the holonomic model of memory
storage and retrieval has been derived from the perceived
contradiction with the accepted dogma that regulation of synaptic
weight must certainly be the only possible storage mechanism in
the brain. Synaptic weight distributions are quite amenable to
neural network, <i>viz.</i> computer-like models of brain/mind
function, but it was very difficult to see how synapses could
function as a storage medium for the interference patterns
implied by holonomic models. Yet the idea of learning and memory
storage by neural networks is itself by no means universally
accepted. Concerning the much-touted ability of computer
analogues of neural networks to learn, Jerry Fodor remarked:
&quot;Much has been made of this, but, in fact, it's a tautology,
not a breakthrough.&quot; <a name="back12"></a><a
href="#footnote12">(12)</a> </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A very promising idea which would obviate some
of these objections to the holonomic model has been the recent
suggestion that the site for storage of information is not the
synapse <i>per se</i>, but associated with the microtubules
making up the cytoskeletal structure of the neuron itself. <a
name="back13"></a><a href="#footnote13">(13)</a> (The synapse is
known to be in indirect yet intimate contact with the microtubule
structure of the neuron.) This model has the immediate advantage,
as Hameroff points out, of increasing the potential effective
complexity and storage capacity of the brain by about seven
orders of magnitude, <a name="back14"></a><a href="#footnote14">(14)</a>
but there are many other attractive aspects to the model as well.
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It would seem that the synapses are concerned
primarily with the large-scale systems of the brain, they are the
functional units enabling coordination and signal transfer
between distinctly separate, sometimes distant locations. For
example, they enable the experimentally-demonstrated phenomena of
the sequential processing of sensory information from primary
sensory cortex through several levels of associational cortex.
Another example would be a neuron in a brain-stem nucleus such as
the locus coeruleus: it may project the entire distance to an
area of the cortex before synapsing on another neuron. As a first
consideration, the synapses thus seem involved with the switching
and transfer of information (analogous perhaps to the transistors
or switches in the central processor of a computer). To assign
them the double duty of also being the <i>storage site</i> for
the information which they manipulate seems merely a default
position (the synaptic-weight model). There is more logic to the
idea that the information that is manipulated via the synaptic
connections has been accessed in structures or locations
independent from the synapses, otherwise the duty of the synapse
in one function would seem to necessarily limit its capacity for
the second function. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Having looked into the neural network models of
brain function, I realize how easy it would be to reject the
foregoing argument if one is convinced of the validity of such a
model. But it is my own view that, although neural networks seem
to simulate brain/mind operation in some trivial respects, the
&quot;connectionist&quot; paradigm as it is called is as
primitive and misleading a model of the human brain/mind as is
the planetary model of the atom (discussed in chapter 2). From
this viewpoint, neural networks may be useful for modeling
&quot;intelligent&quot; processes up to the level, say, of
creating robots for assembly-lines or for playing chess, but to
extrapolate from there to say that by adding a few more bells and
whistles, or even many additional layers of mechanical or
electronic complexity to these beasts, we will then have
duplicated the human mind in a machine... Well, to me and many
others that is sheer folly. I am all for letting the
connectionists connect, and the AI (Artificial Intelligence)
crowd continue their quest to reproduce themselves asexually, but
they do tend to pummel the less-well financed competition with
epithets worthy of the flat-earth advocates of a bygone age.
Hence the present riposte. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The combination of the holonomic
storage/retrieval model with the hypothesis of micro-tubule based
storage sites thus seems even more promising: Hameroff's paper
even suggests that the microtubules of neurons might provide a
location where coherent photons would operate (<i>viz.</i>, the
kind of light necessary for optical holography). In constructing
my own model of brain operation, I have tried not to depend
irrevocably on any particular view now contending, including the
more conservative ones. Yet due to the wide disagreement between
the positions of the several groups of theorists, I have felt
justified to freely use some of the more speculative suggestions
such as holonomic operation and storage, if only as temporary
visual, heuristic devices. Since my intention is merely to
suggest a <i>possible </i>mechanism for the operation of the
habit routine system, (and at the present stage of neuroscience,
it would be unrealistic to hope for more), my overall theory of
psychedelic experience would not be damaged by further research
indicating the brain had many further tricks up its sleeve. The
holonomic, microtubule hypothesis, although it may well be found
to describe the actual operation of the nervous system, will for
my purposes merely provide a convenient conceptual model
facilitating the understanding of the operation of the brain
systems responsible for habit routine search and suspension and
other proposed operations involved with psychedelic experience. I
thought it valuable, however, to introduce the holonomic model on
a level which would show that it was far more than &quot;New Age
Techno-Babble&quot;, an implied if not explicit critical view now
prevalent. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Figure 2 illustrates the location of just a few
of the major brain-parts for the benefit of the general reader.
But in the interest of brevity and concision, I will not attempt
to diagram or explain entry-level details of the model I shall
now present, either in the case of the properties of neurons, or
the general views concerning the functions of the various brain
components taking part in my own theoretical view. For the
layman, the Glossary will be of some help, but a survey of a
textbook such as <i>Principles of Neural Science </i>(Kandel,
Schwartz &amp; Jessell), would be indispensable for evaluating
the proposed model in detail, and comparing it to standard
textbook views representing current paradigms. </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have mentioned that most brain areas are
connected to most other brain areas, the multiplicity of
connections between parts becoming obvious and soon quite
bewildering when one starts examining the various brain
&quot;maps&quot; in Nieuwenhuys' book, for example (the source of
the diagram in figure 2). In addition, it is found that nearly
all of the connections are two-way, the connections between the
thalamus and the primary sensory areas of the cortex, for
example, being reciprocated by nerve pathways (backprojections)
in the opposite direction. It is problematic therefore to
construct a diagram for the supposed &quot;flow of
information&quot; in the brain: if the retina of the eye, for
example, sends its &quot;visual data&quot; to the thalamus (which
has been likened to a relay-station for sensory data), and then
the thalamus sends this signal to the primary visual cortex for
the first stages in the processing of visual information, why
should the primary visual cortex send a nerve pathway directly
back to the same area of the thalamus from which it has just
received the data? The backprojection is not insignificant:
recent findings indicate in the case of vision that there are <i>ten
times</i> as many nerve fibers in the &quot;backwards&quot;
direction as in the direction in which &quot;information&quot; is
supposed to flow! The size and importance of the various
interconnections <a name="back15"></a><a href="#footnote15">(15)</a>
seems to indicate that the actual sensory
&quot;information&quot;, the environmental data ENV in figure 1,
constitutes only a minor part of what is being
&quot;processed&quot; in the brain! Current computer
&quot;data-flow&quot; models of brain operation cannot explain
the facts of the existence and relative importance of
backprojections, as even the best workers in the field will
admit. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But this is exactly what one would expect for a
brain architecture that operated according to the habit routine
model of cognitive function. The environmental data merely
provides cues for the elaboration of the far more complex
informational entity of which we become aware, the habit routine
complex. It is far more complex, because it is generated from the
entirety of previous experience stored in memory, whereas the
actual environmental data is quite limited in scope not least by
the limits of the sensory organs themselves. In size and
complexity, the nerve pathways carrying the primary sensory
information to the cortex are among the less important
connections of the brain. To be sure, the environmental input is
necessary: when you shut your eyes, vision promptly ceases. But
this effect itself may be heavily dependent upon the operation of
habit routines. We are all absolutely and automatically certain
that vision <i>must </i>cease when we close our eyes, and would
be profoundly confused, (if not shocked into psychosis!), were it
to be otherwise, even for a few seconds. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a computer analogy that could be made
in the attempt to account for the curious facts of neural
reciprocating connectivity, that the signaled area must send back
a return signal indicating that it has received information, like
two modems do as they talk to each other. But this would not
explain why return pathways are so much larger. I would propose
that something much more interesting is taking place. In the case
of the nerve pathways from the thalamus to the primary sensory
cortex areas (and back again) for the various sensory modalities,
I believe it is useful to hypothesize that a <i>reverberation </i>is
being established with the two-way signaling, and that this
reverberation <i>is a dynamic informational entity having
holonomic properties</i>. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The thalamo-cortical reciprocating nerve
connections set up for each sensory domain a dynamic
reverberating <i>holoprojection</i> of information, which is
constantly updated and modified with the newly arriving signals
from the sensory organs. It would require a much higher density
of nerve pathways to set up and maintain such reverberation than
to feed in the flux of newly arriving ENV data, thus explaining
the relative importance of the brain connections between the
sensory receptors, the thalamus, and the areas of the sensory
cortex. The suggestion of similarity to the projection of a
holographic image is intentional, for I believe that, not only
are the mathematical principles which predict and describe
optical holography applicable to memory storage, but also to the
ongoing operation of many of the systems of the brain. In
comparison to optical holography, it can also be maintained that
the relation between a given unitary nerve signal (the electrical
action potential of a neuron) and the overall holoprojection to
which it contributes, is analogous to the relation between the
unitary nature of one grain of photoemulsion making up a hologram
(the &quot;photograph&quot; of the interference patterns produced
in optical holography), and the resulting projected holographic
image. The single grain of emulsion on the photographic plate may
only be either &quot;on or off&quot; like the neuron, yet it
theoretically represents the entire holographic projection, <a
name="back16"></a><a href="#footnote16">(16)</a> albeit with a
resolution of zero. It is the same for a single action potential:
it represents the entire holoprojection, but with zero
resolution. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Someone familiar with holography would certainly
ask, but how and where are <i>interference patterns</i> produced,
certainly any holonomic process implies their existence, for it
implies the interference of two or more signals? Dropping one
pebble into a still pond produces concentric waves, but dropping
two pebbles produces an interference pattern between the two sets
of waves. So it may be with the nerve signals of the brain. It is
well known that neurons in their various nerve pathways have a <i>background</i>
rate of firing which, for all intents and purposes, seems to be
merely random noise. Here is pebble number one. Pebble number two
(in the case of the primary sensory holoprojections), is the
impinging signal from ENV (of figure 1), the signal coming from
the sensory receptors. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus the resulting holoprojection is the product
of a dynamic interference pattern resulting from at least two
distinct signals, and is amenable to expression as mathematical
transform coefficients analogous to the mathematical operations
which describe optical holography. In the nerve pathways
maintaining a primary sensory holoprojection, the microtubules of
these neurons record and dynamically maintain the transform
coefficients which represent the information necessary for the
neuron firings to maintain the reverberation. The coefficients
are constantly updated with the sensory signal from the
environment, which also exists as a transform of the interference
patterns actually received by the sensory receptors. Thus there
are two sets of coefficients representing the two signals,
together they contain the information necessary to maintain the
dynamic holoprojection in time. It will be seen that even the
background firing of the neurons, the resident signal, is not
merely random noise, for it is generated from the coefficients
resident in the microtubules and represents the holoprojection in
temporal cross-section. The constant arrival of the ENV signal
produces the dynamic aspect of the primary holoprojection. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But the combination of signals to produce
interference patterns does not end with the primary sensory
holoprojections, for as I shall explain below, holoprojections <i>themselves</i>
combine and overlap, they become superimposed under the guidance
of certain brain components so as to produce further interference
patterns and thus further <i>composite </i>holoprojections. It
can be seen that the &quot;processing of information&quot; in the
brain is therefore accomplished using entire simultaneous fields
of bound &quot;data&quot; from several, or even the entirety of
all ongoing processes. The hypothesis of such a process conflicts
radically with the computer, neural network model of the brain in
which the serial processing (in parallel pathways) of discrete
bits of information is the proposed mechanism. If experimental
results begin to confirm the holoprojection model of brain
operation, they will be a significant argument against the
pursuit of strong Artificial Intelligence as it is presently
conceived. Let us see how the fields of information I have called
holoprojections might function in stages of brain operation
beyond the primary sensory realm. First let us take a closer look
at the thalamus, which plays so central a role in generating the
primary sensory holoprojections which are the data fields upon
which all further brain activity is based. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The thalamus itself is composed of many
different nuclei, widely connected to other brain areas and
interconnected as well. Thus in discussing the various functions
of the thalamus, it must be kept in mind the great diversity of
independent yet interrelated parts and functions comprising this
centrally-important component of the brain. In the case of
vision, after the signals have passed from the retinae through
the optic chiasm which combines and distributes the visual
signals from both eyes to the left and right hemispheres of the
brain (the thalamus also is divided bilaterally), the visual
signal that is to be used for updating the primary visual
holoprojection enters a thalamic nucleus called the lateral
geniculate nucleus, or LGN. The LGN then signals the first stage
of the part of the cortex involved with vision, the primary
visual cortex, and it is from this area that we note the very
important nerve pathways which return directly to the LGN. It is
merely a convenience to say, for example, the signal is
&quot;passed&quot; from here to there, and &quot;then&quot;
passed...etc., for we must remember that all these processes are
dynamic, continuous, and as I have proposed, reverberating and
holonomic. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The function of the LGN of the thalamus thus
appears to be as a &quot;driver&quot; for the reverberation
between the LGN and the first stage of the visual cortex. As I
have suggested, this reverberation may be thought of as a
holoprojection which has at least two functions. Firstly, this
informational entity is the first stage in the generation of (the
visual aspect of) the habit routine complex, it contains the
information which will activate from the frames of memory (stored
in distributed manner in the same visual areas of cortex), the
actual information which makes up the habit routine presented to
thinking2 processes. Secondly, since this holoprojection carries,
at least potentially, the original or &quot;genuine&quot; visual
information, it will be used under certain circumstances to
generate aspects of the visual scene that are detected as
significant and to which the attention is directed. This will
occur by a comparison or superimposition of the primary visual
holoprojection with another holoprojection set up by the habit
routine search system. (As explained below, significance
detection <i>may </i>use the primary sensory holoprojections, or
the memory data activated by these holoprojections instead). </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; An additional function of the primary visual
holoprojection results in the phenomenon of <i>iconic memory</i>,
the very short term visual memory trace that has been
experimentally demonstrated. <a name="back17"></a><a
href="#footnote17">(17)</a> An informational fragment of the
primary visual holoprojection, since the entire holoprojection is
being constantly updated with new visual data, would be expected
to have a very short &quot;half-life&quot; comparable to the 200
to 500 millisecond iconic memory (up to three or four seconds
under certain experimental conditions). Experiments with iconic
memory have shown that it persists for greater periods when
preceded and/or followed by a simple dark field containing little
or no new visual information. Likewise, it may be interfered with
by the process of <i>masking</i> in which a bright field of view,
or interfering patterns are shown. This is exactly what would be
expected for the visual holoprojection model. A paucity of new
visual data arriving to update the holoprojection would allow the
reverberation to persist &quot;as is&quot; for a greater length
of time. Data intentionally designed to confuse or interfere with
the iconic memory would have the effect of overwriting the
relevant aspects of the holoprojection (the transform
coefficients stored in the microtubules of these neurons). </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The extraction of the iconic memory must occur
by other systems involved with thinking2 processes, again
probably by the comparison or superimposition of holoprojections.
There is more than speculation in the idea that such projections
might be superimposed and compared to show similarities and
differences, for the same kind of process can be carried out with
optical holograms (in practice, I am informed, there are
technical difficulties to overcome, but no theoretical
restrictions). Two slightly different optical holograms, for
example, could at least theoretically be projected so that they
cancel each other except for the aspects in which they differ:
only the differences would appear in the projected image.
Likewise, two radically differing holograms having just a few
identical features could be projected to emphasize their common
features. In the brain, the process might be as simple as the
addition and subtraction of the transform coefficients stored in
the microtubules of the contributing neural systems. This would
produce another set of coefficients representing the
superimposition. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At the same time that the primary visual
holoprojection is being generated, of course, all the other
sensory systems are generating their own holoprojections, by
similar mechanisms involving sensory receptors, the thalamic
relay nuclei concerned with those senses, and areas of the
cortex. Thus for hearing we get an audio holoprojection from
which can be extracted <i>echoic memory</i> (analogous to iconic
memory). The audio holoprojection is used to activate the audio
domain of the frames of memory going into the generation of the
habit routine complex. Tactile sensations and proprioception
likewise produce their reverberations, and so forth. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The binding and superimposition of all the
primary sensory holoprojections is accomplished by a scanning
mechanism only recently detected by neurological experiments. <a
name="back18"></a><a href="#footnote18">(18)</a> This scanning
operation is also carried out by a nucleus of the thalamus, the
intralaminar nucleus. Now what is scanned is not the actual
primary holoprojections themselves, but the memory information
which they activate in the various regions of the cortex. This
activation occurs as the holoprojection signal transits through
the pyramidal cells of the several <i>layers</i> of the cortex
taking part in the reverberation. The sum total of all ongoing
sensory holoprojections, impinging on the memory data distributed
in the same areas of the cortex that take part in the set up of
the various holoprojections, activates this memory data such that
the intralaminar nucleus, acting again as a driver for the
generation of a holoprojection, creates the habit routine complex
holoprojection. The memory data in this process is thus analogous
to the role of primary sensory data in the generation of the
primary sensory holoprojection. Remember that we are
hypothesizing that this memory data is associated with the
microtubules of the neurons in the cortex and not their synapses,
so while the neurons and their synapses in the circuit between
the thalamic relay nuclei and the cortex are maintaining the
primary holoprojection using the signals from the sensory
receptors, the holoprojection itself, as an interference pattern,
is resonating with the stored interference patterns in memory
resident in the microtubules. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The habit routine complex holoprojection is the
bound informational entity presented to thinking2 processes,
having the various properties already described in chapter 3. The
memory information used to generate the habit routine is, as just
proposed above, analogous to the original sensory information:
the sensory signals are used to set up the primary sensory
holoprojections, and the activated signals from memory are used
to set up the habit routine holoprojection. In each case we have
a thalamic nucleus acting as the driver for the process, using an
input of transform coefficients to produce the holoprojection.
But the intralaminar nucleus scan which sets up the habit routine
is deriving its input from the entire cortex, not just the
primary sensory areas. The habit routine complex is much more
than just primary sensory information taken from memory, for
remember that a habit routine contains pre-programmed
associations with ideas, with habits of thinking, and it also
contains recommended actions (including not only physical
responses but thoughts, opinions, implied value judgments, etc.),
that represent the sum total of ways in which similar situations
were dealt with or reacted to in the past. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The higher domains of the cortex itself are
using the primary sensory holoprojections to derive associational
information such as that concerning depth perception, for example
(from both audio and visual sources in combination), as well as
perception of motion, types and categories of perceptions, as
well as cross-modal associations. Thus the primary
holoprojections generate far more from the memory data than just
elementary sensory information. This is why the ILN scan cannot
be simply of the primary holoprojections themselves, but of the
result of the entire sequential associative process they generate
in the cortex. The process extends over the entire cortex. For
instance, at the most advanced level of associational processes
in the frontal cortex regions, you have a bound, unitary, and
multi-sensory short-term-memory of events (and your reaction to
these events) that just happened a moment ago, produced by
successive stages of associational cortex operation. This memory
information is also scanned and becomes part of the habit routine
complex. In this sense even current experience is very much like
a reverberation, for current evaluation of reality is based upon
the interpretation of reality just experienced which has been
re-injected into the ongoing habit routine complex. Thus the
significances that thinking2 decides to examine more closely by
extracting information from the primary holoprojections are
actively perpetuated. Using this mechanism we can increase the
proportion of &quot;raw reality&quot; in the current habit
routine to override the &quot;interpretation&quot; of reality
that would be supplied by the unmolested habit routine alone. And
here is where the psychedelic experience comes in. The process
which is so startlingly activated by psychedelic drugs, is the
very same process that we can accomplish, if on a more limited
level, as just described. Let us look closer at this overall
process, for it involves the generation of additional composite
holoprojections which have more to do with conscious thinking2
operations, including free will, than with automatic sub- or
pre-conscious thinking1 processes and their holoprojections. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The nuclei of the thalamus are also important
for the generation of these composite holoprojections, but at
this stage, other brain nuclei become partners with the thalamus
and cortex. Again, these older, more &quot;primitive&quot; parts
of the brain act as drivers in dialog with the cortex to produce
the composite informational fields. <a name="back19"></a><a
href="#footnote19">(19)</a> Among the brain components taking
part are the locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei of the brain stem,
the amygdala, hippocampus, the basal ganglia and cerebellum,
among others. It is certainly an ambitious statement to say that
I will attempt to explain the role of some these brain areas, but
here goes: </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; First let us consider the role of the locus
coeruleus and the raphe nuclei, for it is the nerve pathways
connecting these two brain areas with the cortex and with each
other that are the primary site of biochemical action of the
psychedelic drugs. It is with these nuclei that I must show how
significance detection and the suspension of habit routine is
accomplished. I would propose that the locus coeruleus is the
master functioning body, the driver which through dialog with
essentially all brain areas but particularly the thalamus, the
raphe nuclei and the cortex, produces the composite
holoprojection containing information about significance or <i>salience
</i>not only in the environment, but also even in the ongoing
processes of thought leading to ideas, opinions, etc. I will
refrain from presenting a diagram of the connecting nervous
pathways between the various brain areas cited as it is extremely
difficult to do so meaningfully at this stage. Certainly, as I
have already said, there are plenty of connecting pathways
between all of these brain parts, there are rather too many, it
would seem. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now the statement that the connections between
the raphe nuclei, the locus coeruleus, and their connections to
the thalamus and cortex are the primary site of biochemical
action of the psychedelic drugs is based quite solidly on recent
brain research. <a name="back20"></a><a href="#footnote20">(20)</a>
We know that LSD and other psychedelics, for example, exert
powerful influence on the operation of neurons emitting and
receiving at their synapses the neurotransmitter, <i>serotonin.</i>
There remains considerable mystery as to <i>how </i>the drugs
react with these neurons, whether they activate or inhibit
serotonin receptors, which types of serotonin receptors are
affected, and so forth. There is also considerable mystery as to <i>how</i>
these affected neurons might bring about the overall
psychological result. The first question remains, at the present
state of research, very difficult to answer. But it is with the
second question that I believe we should start, for there seems
to be enough information now available to formulate a model. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is generally agreed by neuroscientists today
that the locus coeruleus acts as a kind of novelty or
significance detector, its activation (in animals) has been shown
to increase in response to stressful or noxious stimuli,
preferred food and other complex arousing events, and even to
changes in body systems such as the level of oxygen or carbon
dioxide in the blood. The psychedelic drugs have been repeatedly
shown to greatly increase the activity of the locus coeruleus,
but not when applied directly to the cells which make up the
nucleus. Thus it has been hypothesized that the state of the
locus coeruleus must be influenced by another nucleus or system
which itself is directly affected by psychedelics. Some relevant
facts concerning the locus coeruleus: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The locus coeruleus (LC) consists of two dense clusters of
    noradrenergic neurons located bilaterally in the upper pons
    at the lateral border of the 4th ventricle. The LC, which
    projects diffusely to virtually all regions of the neuraxis,
    receives an extraordinary convergence of somatic, visceral
    and other sensory inputs from all regions of the body and has
    been likened to a novelty detector. Thus, the LC represents a
    unique nodal point both for the detection of significant
    changes in the internal and external environment and for
    relaying this information to the remainder of the central
    nervous system. It is not surprising that hallucinogenic
    drugs, which produce such dramatic changes in perception,
    would alter either directly or indirectly the function of LC
    neurons. <a name="back21"></a><a href="#footnote21">(21)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In keeping with the holonomic model, I would
propose that the locus coeruleus is the driver which produces a
composite holoprojection consisting of the superimposition and
canceling of primary holoprojections including the habit routine
holoprojection to yield a field of information concerning <i>significances
</i>in the ongoing experience of the organism. The detection of
significance, or salience, normally is derived from the same
memory data from which the habit routine complex is generated,
and is merely a repeat detection of salience that has occurred in
the past. When the test animal mentioned above is shown a
preferred food, for instance, and its locus coeruleus is shown to
increase in activity, the salience detected is obviously relative
to memory data of the preferred food. But when I am the test
animal in a French restaurant, when some unknown yet succulent
dish is placed before me, I begin to extract information directly
from the primary sensory holoprojections to try to deduce the
composition and possible methods of preparation of the mysterious
delicacy. Memory information in the habit routine will still be
the primary source of information in these deliberations, but my
Attention will guide the process to actual examination of the
&quot;genuine&quot; sensory data contained in the primary
holoprojections. As I mentioned above in introducing the
functions of the primary holoprojections, we see that salience
detection <i>may</i> use the primary data, but normally, and
routinely, salience is merely a repeat performance of previous
detection, based on the habit routine complex itself. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The connections of the locus coeruleus which
accomplish the detection of normal salience from the habit
routine data may be simply the interconnections with the cortex.
The locus coeruleus receives a modest input from only one area of
the cortex, the prefrontal cortex, but it sends its output to the
entire cortex. We see again (as in the case of the pathways
between the thalamus and the primary sensory cortex) the
situation where the &quot;return&quot; signal is far more
important than the &quot;input&quot; signal, and this suggests,
as in the nervous pathways taking part in the generation of the
primary sensory holoprojections, a reverberation, in this case
the salience detection holoprojection. <a name="back22"></a><a
href="#footnote22">(22)</a> The signal from the prefrontal cortex
is the final stage of the entire process of association, so it
will obviously represent the complex associational memory data of
past salience detection that was experienced. The return pathways
to all cortex areas might also be thought of as facilitating the
cancellation or ignoring of all features of the habit routine
except for the salient entities, so that the resulting
holoprojection contains only information about these entities.
Thus the Attention is directed to the salience which practically
jumps out of its surroundings. The locus coeruleus has several
inputs besides that from the prefrontal cortex, but these inputs
function to modulate the holoprojection generation in various
ways. A particularly important control of the process is
accomplished by the raphe nuclei. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The raphe nuclei of the brain stem are
particularly important to salience detection and to the
psychedelic experience because they contain the great majority of
neurons of the brain which use serotonin as a neurotransmitter.
Some of the earliest work on the effect of LSD in the brain found
that &quot;LSD and other indoleamine hallucinogens...have potent,
direct inhibitory effects upon serotonergic neurons located in
the raphe nuclei of the brainstem.&quot; <a name="back23"></a><a
href="#footnote23">(23)</a> Now it has been well established that
the serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei project heavily to
the locus coeruleus, and likewise that serotonin inhibits the
firing of the type of neuron found in the locus coeruleus. <a
name="back24"></a><a href="#footnote24">(24)</a> As mentioned
above, studies have also confirmed the psychedelic agents have as
their target at least some of the many types of serotonin
receptors on neurons both of the areas signaled by the raphe
nuclei, and on the raphe serotonin neurons themselves
(autoreceptors). The raphe neurons also project widely throughout
the brain, to all areas of the cortex, (strongly to the
prefrontal cortex from which the locus coeruleus derives its
input), the thalamus, the amygdala, virtually the entire nervous
system. Thus I would propose that the raphe nuclei are the
principle mechanism of control, the driver which guides the mode
of function of salience detection, as well as the manner in which
the detection is used and subsequently stored in memory. It
appears that Attention and other thinking2 process use the
serotonergic system of the brain, based in the raphe nuclei, to
direct the detection and use of salience, but not simply by
&quot;inhibition&quot; as would be implied by the observed
&quot;inhibitory&quot; action of serotonin on the neurons of the
locus coeruleus, or the observed &quot;inhibition&quot; of
serotonergic neurons by LSD. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a curious fact of the human brain, that
fully 75% of the neurons therein are supposedly &quot;inhibitory
neurons&quot;, whereas in the monkey the figure is 45%, and in
the cat a mere 35%. <a name="back25"></a><a href="#footnote25">(25)</a>
Clearly these facts must have some tremendously important
significance, not only for the type of functioning they imply of
the brain, but in some sense they must tell us something very
important about the psychological differences between man and
animals, particularly the great disparity of intellectual
capacity. A not very convincing speculation has been that the
large proportion of inhibitory neurons allows a
&quot;streamlining of thinking&quot; in which groups of brain
cells are more quickly returned to a state of readiness after
some operation. <a name="back26"></a><a href="#footnote26">(26)</a>
I would propose that the inhibitory neurons do not
&quot;inhibit&quot; in such a literal manner, but rather are
concerned with the superimposition of holoprojections in which a <i>cancellation
</i>or <i>subtraction</i> of information results, such as the
manner in which all peripheral information from memory going into
the generation of the salience holoprojection is removed so as to
yield a composite holoprojection consisting of <i>only</i> the
detected entities. It might be said that human mental powers, as
opposed to that of lower animals, reside primarily in the ability
to discriminate between and detect widely differing types of
significance not only in the environment but within thought
patterns of abstractions and concerning <i>ideas</i> and
constructs of the intellect. These human feats, I would propose,
are accomplished using the wide network of inhibitory neurons
functioning to produce composite holoprojections derived through
the comparison and <i>subtraction</i> of informational fields one
from another, to reveal patterns the complexity of which far
outstrips the power of lower animals to detect. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There are probably several brain operations,
brought about by combinations of brain parts including a nucleus
of the midbrain or brainstem as a driver, which generate such
composite holoprojections. The detection of emotional content, or
<i>valence</i>, is probably accomplished using the amygdala as a
driver in dialog with the cortex and other nuclei, superimposing
the same primary holoprojections as are used for salience
detection. But the salience detection of the locus coeruleus,
controlled and modulated by the raphe nuclei connections
throughout the brain, generates what is probably the most
important holoprojection of the brain/mind, (or in any case,
second only in importance to the habit routine holoprojection).
And it is upon the generation of this salience detection
holoprojection that the psychedelic drugs exert their effects. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now it was soon noticed, after the inhibitory
effect of LSD and similar psychedelic drugs on the raphe nuclei
was discovered, that other psychedelic agents such as mescaline
and the phenethylamine family did not produce the inhibition. The
<i>indirect effect on the locus coeruleus was, however, as
important as with LSD. </i>The effect is indirect, for as
mentioned, the application of psychedelic agents to locus
coeruleus neurons themselves fails to alter their activity. But
since the locus coeruleus salience detection system involves the
entire cortex, and the serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei
project to the entire nervous system, it is evident that the
control of salience detection would be alterable at many
different sites of potential psychedelic drug action. A direct
change in the raphe nuclei is the possible primary action in the
case of LSD, whereas a change in the <i>effect</i> of the
signaling by the raphe neurons, either in the locus coeruleus or
possibly the cortex itself, might be the mechanism for mescaline.
The overall effect is in both cases a change, which appears to be
an increase, in the rate and type of salience detected by the
locus coeruleus system. I am tempted to repeat some of Huxley's
observations about significance quoted at the end of chapter 3,
but instead will quote Alan Watts, here writing about his first
experiment with psychedelic drugs: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;I have said that my general impression of the first
    experiment was that the &quot;mechanism&quot; by which we
    screen our sense-data and select only some of them as
    significant had been partially suspended. Consequently, I
    felt that the particular feeling which we associate with
    &quot;the meaningful&quot; was projected indiscriminately
    upon everything, and then rationalized in ways that might
    strike an independent observer as ridiculous&#151;unless,
    perhaps, the subject were unusually clever at rationalizing.
    However, the philosopher cannot pass up the point that our
    selection of some sense-data as significant and others as
    insignificant is always with relation to particular
    purposes&#151;survival, the quest for certain pleasures,
    finding one's way to some destination, or whatever it may
    be.&quot; <a name="back27"></a><a href="#footnote27">(27)</a>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have suggested above that there are two modes
of salience detection, the first merely automatic and based upon
previously experienced situations, and a second which is based on
the genuine data of the primary holoprojections. Remember my
little story of noticing the grey rock in the middle of the
pathway. Automatic salience detection brought it to my awareness,
and interpreted it relative to previous experience. Yet some
unconsciously perceived anomalous data, a slight movement, a
color not quite in keeping with experience, caused me to suspect
an error, and <i>choose</i> to examine the raw sensory data
itself and Decide that something was amiss. At this point the
original habit routine was overruled, and a new interpretation
actively demanded by the Attention. This was accomplished by use
of the working memory, thought to be a function of and resident
in the prefrontal cortex, <i>the same cortical area from which
the locus coeruleus receives its sole input.</i> Remember also my
stated feeling that under the influence of psychedelics, it seems
that the habit routines of interpretation in this case would be
at least momentarily suspended, and after a moment multiple habit
routines might arrive at thinking2 processes. All these
observations seem to indicate that psychedelics would be
interfering with the habit routine holoprojection, rather than
the salience holoprojection. But according to my neurological
model so far, it would appear that psychedelic agents interfere
with the control exerted on the salience holoprojection by the
raphe nuclei and the serotonergic neurons extending widely to all
areas of the brain. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>I would now propose that the profound
alteration of the salience holoprojection by psychedelics,
illustrated both by neurological data and by the practical
observations of Huxley, Watts, and many others, causes the
individual, using the conscious mechanisms of thinking2, to
himself suspend the dependence on the habit routine
holoprojection. It is the cumulative effect of not only added
salience detected in the ENV both external and internal, but of
the interpretation of this increased salience as itself extremely
significant, that leads to a veritable avalanche of salience
detection which simply overwhelms normal acceptance of and
dependence on the habit routine system. </b> </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The habit routines are still assembled and are
there in the background, but they are almost completely ignored
by Attention, Decision, and other thinking2 processes amidst the
flood of salience perceived. Thus, the psychedelic experience is,
in an important sense, <i>voluntary,</i> and this would explain
the ability to achieve such states through meditation and other
voluntary mechanisms. That the habit routines are still assembled
and available to some extent is illustrated by the common ability
during the lucid end-stages of psychedelic experience to
recognize a duality in experience: a perception of the way things
appear with &quot;the doors of perception&quot; cleansed, and a
simultaneous recognition of how the same scene would appear in a
normal state of mind governed by habit routine. Such realization
extends to the perception one's personality traits, one's
prejudices and automatisms of behavior, from a viewpoint that is
essentially <i>outside</i> of the self and beyond the ego. In
this state I believe, the habit routines have been completely
suspended in function, and salience detection is using the
information of the primary holoprojections. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At the request of thinking2, the primary sensory
holoprojections become the subject of meticulous examination,
genuine reality floods through, the habit routines ignored. The
raphe nuclei must in some sense be acting as a control mechanism
for this switch-over, allowing the locus coeruleus system to
create superimpositions of the genuine data rather than the
memory data. This switch-over probably occurs in the cortex
itself, by the control exerted by the serotonergic neurons from
the raphe nuclei which contact both inhibitory interneurons and
the pyramidal neurons of the cortex. <a name="back28"></a><a
href="#footnote28">(28)</a></p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental evidence supporting the above model
relating the neurological operations of brain systems and the
habit routine search and suspension hypothesis of normal and
psychedelic functioning has been easy to find in the literature.
Of course, due to the current state of neuroscience, it is often
found that alternative interpretations of experimental results,
leading to radically different models, is possible. Such is the
case here, and for any specific experiment which I might use as
evidence for my model, others would find it just as easy to use
the same data for another view. For this reason, as well as in
the interest of brevity, I shall mention only a few examples. A
thorough survey would require at least another volume, and the
more important chapters of the present volume still await
exposition. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A vast body of literature concerning brain
function and its perturbation by brain lesions goes back more
than a century. A great many studies have been done concerning
patients whose brains have sustained damage through accidents or
necessary brain surgery, and experimentally, countless numbers of
animals of every description have undergone destruction,
disconnection or removal of various brain areas in the attempt to
localize various sensory, motor, and cognitive functions of the
brain. With such a wealth of evidence, it is not hard to find
studies that might support almost any model one would care to
dream up. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I will mention just a few cases which have been
well documented, and which deal with damage to the areas of the
prefrontal cortex. This brain area, it will be remembered, has
been suggested both in the literature and in my own model as an
important center involved with the working memory and with the
most complex levels of associative processing by the cortex. Such
association might be expected to facilitate complex cognitive
phenomena such as the expression of personality traits, decision
making and attention, voluntary action and free will, the
perception of and reaction to complex social situations, <i>i.e.,</i>
the most complex and human of cognitive functions. (It is the
frontal lobe, and especially the prefrontal area that has seen
such a massive expansion and development in the recent evolution
of the hominids.) Remember also that it is from the prefrontal
cortex that the sole cortical projection to the locus coeruleus
occurs. Projections from the prefrontal cortex also extend to the
raphe nuclei and the amygdala. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The model I have devised would therefore predict
that disruption of frontal lobe integrity should produce
alteration of salience detection and the evaluation and
expression of emotion, and radical changes in the assembly and
use of habit routines, especially as they apply to these most
advanced cognitive and affective functions. Since the connections
to the locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, and amygdala hypothesized
to be important in my model project from the prefrontal cortex,
interference with salience and valence functions should certainly
be observed in cases of prefrontal damage. And prefrontal damage
resulting in an impaired function of working memory in supplying
parameters for the ongoing habit routine search process should
produce symptoms identifiable as resulting from impaired
generation, access to, or use of habit routine in ongoing
cognitive operations. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A very famous case of brain injury in the
prefrontal area, recently the subject of a book and various
newspaper articles, is that of the construction foreman Phineas
P. Gage. In 1848 Gage sustained a massive brain injury when an
explosives procedure went terribly wrong and sent an iron tamping
bar vertically through the frontal region of his brain.
Miraculously, Gage seemed at first practically unaffected, even
walking some distance, and conversing with his men on the way to
medical attention. It was only later that the peculiar kind of
mental deficits that necessarily result from this type of
prefrontal injury came to light. The case has recently become the
subject of detailed attention thanks to the work of Hanna
Damasio, who was able to reconstruct the precise location of
Gage's brain damage using state-of-the-art computer techniques to
analyze the features of Gage's skull, a museum exhibit at the
Harvard Medical School Museum for over a hundred years. An
overview of this work together with a detailed examination of the
symptomatic evidence in the case is presented in a recent book. <a
name="back29"></a><a href="#footnote29">(29)</a> </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was said of Gage that he became a different
man, his entire personality was radically changed. It seemed that
he had completely lost access to his previously acquired social
conventions and rules and had become childish, irresponsible, yet
strangely undiminished in terms of episodic and autobiographical
memory, language ability, even, one might say, intelligence. In
terms of the habit routine model: In the daily yet complex social
relationships in which personality is expressed, it appeared that
Gage's behavior was capricious, or even <i>random</i>, the habit
routines of personality which are among the most complex and
highly associative aspects of the habit routine complex, were no
longer accessible (reconstructible) from the memory of the
frontal cortex and by consequence, his automatic social behavior
was based not upon previous experience but was instead <i>arbitrary
and random</i> rather than merely childish. In theory, it seems,
he could still reason out how one should act in a given
situation, but when forced into a decision by a life situation,
he was essentially powerless to apply such reasoning. This may
illustrate how dependent we are on habit routine for making
decisions and for the expression of personality. In the case of
personality traits, it would obviously be impossible to calculate
logically and consciously how to react to a situation in accord
with our established personality. The reaction must be automatic
and instantaneous. If this is also the case with at least some
aspects of decision making, a statement I previously made becomes
even more pertinent: &quot;We see what we have already
seen...&quot; and decide in ways that we have previously decided
to an overwhelming degree. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The symptoms described by Antonio Damasio <a
name="back30"></a><a href="#footnote30">(30)</a> could well be
explained in these terms, but in addition, Damasio describes the
case of a prefrontal patient which he had himself examined in
detail. The patient, referred to as Elliot, had undergone surgery
for the removal of a tumor at the base of the frontal cortex,
just above the eye sockets. Surrounding brain tissue had also
been removed or damaged, and thus a large portion of the
prefrontal cortices were dysfunctional. As with Gage, the largest
part of the damage was in the ventromedial (lower-central) area,
and many of the symptoms were repeated, such as radical
personality change. But particularly striking were symptoms that
might be interpreted as resulting from interference with the
salience and valence systems involving connections from the
damaged prefrontal region to the locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei,
and to the amygdala. These symptoms might be categorized as a
lack of ability to plan ahead, to make decisions concerning
strategy and the immediate future, almost, one might say, a
deficit of free will. The obvious intelligence which Elliot
retained could not be mustered to organize even simple sequences
of activity as required for his job, for instance. In addition,
he exhibited an emotional flatness or detachment in striking
contrast to his pre-operative character. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Interestingly, a lengthy series of psychological
tests indicated that, like Gage, Elliot could <i>theoretically </i>make
such decisions, such as those pertaining to moral judgments, ends
and means problem solving, awareness of consequences concerning
both events and social situations, etc. But when a real life
situation forced a decision based on habit routine, the
theoretical knowledge seemed impossible to apply. In the
theoretical situation, we could say that the records of social
information in memory were actively and intentionally used to <i>reconstruct
</i>the required decision from scratch, whereas in the life
situation what was required was an automatic referral to the
habit routines representing such decisions that had been made
over a lifetime: the records of previous decisions as represented
in the highest levels of habit routine had been destroyed along
with frontal cortex, <a name="back31"></a><a href="#footnote31">(31)</a>
whereas the previous memories themselves upon which the previous
decisions had been based were still intact in other areas of the
cortex. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The combination of decision deficit with
emotional flatness led Damasio to construct a model he calls the
Somatic-Marker Hypothesis, and it has attracted much favorable
comment. <a name="back32"></a><a href="#footnote32">(32)</a> I
will not describe it here, but will instead offer my own
interpretation of the concurrence of the two symptoms. We could
describe an inability to make rational decisions not only as due
to deficits in the assembly of the highest levels of the habit
routine complex, but also on the basis of faulty salience
detection, since the relative significance of events and aspects
of reality, both present and in memory, must obviously play an
important role in constructing plans based upon contingencies and
the evaluation of probabilities and strategies. With both of the
above cases, Gage and Elliot, there was a theoretical ability to
make decisions, based upon reasoning processes utilizing episodic
and autobiographical memory of events themselves. Likewise,
reasoning processes and memory would be able to <i>deduce</i>
significance both in the internal and external environments, but
the automation of salience detection would be deficient. The key
to understanding the overall syndrome, however, is seeing that
the generation of emotional content by a holoprojection driven by
the amygdala must be a process based on information in the
salience detection holoprojection. It is with the various
significances detected in the external and internal environment
that emotional expression deals, all routine and superfluous
information merely falls by the wayside and is ignored. The SD
holoprojection feedback to all areas of the cortex accomplishes
this cancellation or ignorance of irrelevancy, to leave the
detected significances in stark contrast relative to the
background. From this holoprojection of detected significance
comes the data from which the emotional value or valence is
generated. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is easy to see, then, that if the salience
detection system is perturbed or interrupted, a naturally
resulting symptom should be emotional flatness, or even randomly
expressed emotion since the amygdala is not itself damaged but
merely has little or no accurate information to work with. Elliot
himself realized perfectly well not only his inabilities in
making decisions in the face of real-life situations, but also
how subjects or situations that had once caused him strong
emotion no longer evoked any reaction whatsoever. Here we can see
that, since he remembers subjects which formerly caused an
emotional reaction, he can also theoretically evaluate emotional
content just as he can theoretically evaluate significance,
reconstructing the information from long-term memory. But it is
the automated accomplishment of these functions which has been
perturbed, and in real-life, on-the-spot decision making,
reconstruction does not and cannot substitute for the automated
processes. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Damasio's hypothesis, the deficit
for decision is based on the deficit of emotional content, but I
believe the situation is quite the reverse, that emotion is based
on significance detection necessary in the process of automatic
decision-making, and that both of these functions are based upon
intact operation and connections of the prefrontal cortices to
the locus coeruleus and the raphe nuclei. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now I cannot tell from Damasio's descriptions
whether the actual connections projecting from the frontal cortex
to the locus coeruleus, amygdala and raphe nuclei were damaged or
severed during Elliot's operation. It would seem in Gage's case
that the trajectory of the iron bar might well indicate that
these connections were destroyed: they are grouped together into
the medial forebrain bundle, an important nerve pathway passing
directly through the ventromedial area. This pathway also
contains the projections returning from the locus coeruleus and
raphe nuclei which connect to all areas of the cortex. Whether
the severing of the medial forebrain bundle alone produces a
syndrome similar to the actual destruction of prefrontal cortex
is not known, but if my hypothesis is correct, the severing of
the medial forebrain bundle connections to the locus coeruleus
and raphe nuclei should produce a very similar result as is seen
in cases such as Gage and Elliot. Damage to the frontal cortices
may have to be quite widespread to bring about the same result as
the simple severing of these nervous pathways. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is another type of damage to the frontal
cortex which produces rather different results. So far, in the
two cases mentioned, the principal damage was to the ventromedial
areas, just above the eyes and centrally located. When damage to
the dorsolateral areas also occurs, psychological tests indicate
an important deficit in working memory accompanies the syndrome.
These same tests, given to Elliot, showed no disability
whatsoever in his working memory function. Inasmuch as the
working memory has been proposed here as an important part of the
process of habit routine search, its disruption should alter the
process in certain ways. In the cases of ventromedial damage
cited above, I proposed that the actual memory information
necessary for construction of the highest associative levels of
the habit routine complex had been destroyed. But with
dorsolateral damage as well, an important part of the system
which carries out the habit routine search is destroyed: the
ability to supply parameters for the search is impeded. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was proposed that conscious and unconscious
parameters guiding the successive scans producing the habit
routine complex were introduced via the working memory. The ILN
scan, incorporating WM parameters would, on the succeeding scan
retrieve a modified selection of memory information according to
the parameters previously scanned. And it was proposed that this
&quot;small window on reality&quot; was essentially the only
normal way to guide the processes of thinking1 using free will or
intentional creativity. In experimental situations we notice
deficits in precisely these domains. Fuster, in his book on the
prefrontal cortex, states that &quot;In general terms, ablation
studies indicate that the cortex of the dorsal and lateral
prefrontal surface is primarily involved in cognitive aspects of
behavior. The rest of the prefrontal cortex, medial and ventral,
appears to be mostly involved in affective and motivational
functions...&quot; <a name="back33"></a><a href="#footnote33">(33)</a>
(such as salience detection and emotional evaluation.) </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In human prefrontal patients, a striking
experimental demonstration of working memory disruption due to
dorsolateral damage is the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, here
described by Dudai: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The subject is presented with a series of stimulus cards
    and a deck of response cards. The cards bear coloured
    geometric patterns (e.g. a single blue star, three red
    circles), and can be matched by categories (e.g. colour,
    form, number). The examiner selects a sorting category (e.g.
    colour), but does not inform the subject. The latter is
    instructed to place a response card in front of a stimulus
    card, wherever he or she thinks it should go. The examiner
    then informs the subject if the response was right or wrong,
    and the subject uses this information to obtain correct
    responses in the following matches. After ten consecutive
    responses, the examiner shifts the sorting category without
    warning, and the subject must unveil it again to obtain
    correct matches. The procedure is then repeated with other
    sorting categories. Patients with prefrontal lesions find
    this task abnormally difficult. The interpretation is that
    they have difficulties in using temporarily stored
    information to regulate their actions. <a name="back34"></a><a
    href="#footnote34">(34)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The function of working memory as a parameter
store for ongoing habit routine search is well illustrated by the
experiment. The original instructions for the experiment, which
the subject has little difficulty in following, create a simple
habit routine for performing the sorting according to the first
learned category. But when the category is changed, the habit
routine developed for the experiment remains fixed, its
alteration by new working memory parameters is difficult if not
impossible. Most prefrontal patients with dorsolateral damage
have great difficulty in this test, but Elliot, whose damage was
limited to ventromedial areas, passed it with flying colors. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now the evidence concerning prefrontal damage
and its interpretation using my model takes on some additional
relevance in consideration of the following experimental
findings: In a series of experiments using PET brain scan
techniques to observe subjects in altered states of consciousness
brought about by psychedelics, the primary effect noted was a
significant increase in the activity of the frontal cortices. <a
name="back35"></a><a href="#footnote35">(35)</a> This result, in
combination with Aghajanian's findings of greatly increased locus
coeruleus activity caused by psychedelic drugs, lends my
interpretation some credibility. Under the influence of
psychedelic drugs, the cognitive functions of working memory and
habit routine search, significance detection and emotional value
detection are all working overtime, and they all are facilitated
by the prefrontal cortices. Whether this is all mere coincidence,
or an indication that pieces of a very intricate puzzle are
falling into place only time and further research will tell.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A vast quantity of experimental evidence awaits
the organizing ability of some yet-to-be-discovered overall model
of brain function. In reading the many papers dealing with just
the prefrontal cortex in the recently published <i>The Cognitive
Neurosciences</i> <a name="back36"></a><a href="#footnote36">(36)</a>
for example, one is immediately impressed with both the wealth of
experimental information available and the corresponding wealth
of models, terminologies, and hypotheses which attempt to
organize this information. But such a cornucopia of viewpoints
must certainly be a sign that we modelers are very much like the
collection of blind men describing the elephant from the feel of
merely local areas of the overall beast. Who will be the
visionary to discover the viewpoint from which all these models
and observations become a united whole? I certainly cannot
pretend that the cognitive and neurological models I have
presented here fulfill that function. I would be the first to
admit the highly speculative nature of the above neurological
model that I have presented, and would not be surprised nor
indignant if it were said that the area that I was describing was
not even part of the elephant! </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In my view, the only claim for consideration of
my ideas stems from their origin in the attempt to explain the
body of evidence that has accumulated concerning the psychedelic
experience, evidence which has been almost entirely disregarded
by the mainstream of science for nearly thirty years. Had it not
been for such neglect, which in part was forced by an idiotic
international effort to fight an unwinnable, self-defeating and
therefore irrational &quot;war on drugs&quot;, it seems to me
that several fields of study of human psychology and neuroscience
would have by now achieved far greater insight than is the case. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But we can blame not only the drug warriors, the
politicians and intelligence organizations, the religious
moralizers and puritanical oafs for this ignorance: scientists
too are to blame, perhaps equally so. It was easy for me, from
the outside of the scientific establishment, to see that one of
the most important discoveries ever made by Western science was
being ignored, even vilified. But from the inside of that
scientific enterprise, it was apparently no easier to see what
was happening than it was for those inside the traps of religious
fanaticism or the carefully cultivated paranoia which is the
paradigm for institutions providing much of the raw material for
the politicians: the intelligence organizations. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Scientists, at least outside the realm of their
own specialties, often seem as prone to narrow-mindedness as are
other intelligent yet confused men. It seems to be almost
instinctual that men follow such narrow pathways through life,
and the habit-routine model is certainly also an attempt to show
how such narrowness might actually be derived from an inherent
neurological feature of the human organism, rather than something
which we must label instinctual for want of a better
understanding. The functioning of our nervous systems utilizing
the habit routine system might be taken as a convenient excuse
for the current deplorable state of civilization, this
&quot;century of holocaust,&quot; but now that I have laid bare
the roots of the situation, it is a lame excuse at best. In the
next chapter I will explore the idea that this inherent
neurological and cognitive feature has been an essential (yet now
for man a skeuomorphic or vestigial) characteristic in the stages
of evolution not only of man, but of all animal life. </p>

<p> (19) I might go so far as to suggest that most, if not all
cognitive functions of the brain are accomplished by a dialog
among two or more brain parts, and not by a single area acting
alone to effect some cognitive result which is then passed on to
another area. The multiple holoprojection model is entirely in
accord with this suggestion. The model has conceptual
similarities to another important &quot;checks and balances&quot;
feedback system of the body, the hormonal system. <a

<p> (22) Another way of thinking about the disparity between
&quot;input&quot; and &quot;output&quot; signals again
illustrates a basic conceptual fault with the computer model of
brain function. In the case of the locus coeruleus for example,
it has been stated that since its &quot;output&quot; extends to
such diverse regions, its functions must also be multiple and
widespread. This view has the underlying assumption that the
locus coeruleus is sending information it has processed from its
modest input, to many locations where this data is then used for
many different functions. But the alternative view I have
proposed is that the locus coeruleus accomplishes only one
function. The multiple and widely connected &quot;output&quot;
pathways are not to be seen as sending information, but rather as
<i>requesting or accessing information </i>of a widely diverse
nature (relating to the detection of salience in many domains,
situations, and complexities). The result of this request is then
cycled back to the locus coeruleus via its modest input from the
frontal cortex, as a reverberating holoprojection.<a

<h2>6.&nbsp; Instinct </h2>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ideas expressed so far, particularly those in
the last two chapters, were not the starting point for the
present theory of psychedelic experience. They were, on the
contrary, only recently developed along with my also recent
interest in cognitive neuroscience and the organization of the
human brain. But rather than present the components of my theory
in the chronological order of their development, for the purposes
of this book it was desirable to construct a theoretical
framework within which my principle hypothesis would, when
revealed, already have a persuasive foundation. The actual
starting point of the theory began with an idea which occurred to
me several years ago during my tenure at an institution of
&quot;enforced languishing&quot;. I had plenty of time to
consider at length my experiences, and to re-read the many
volumes I had collected along the way (volumes which, somewhat
unbelievably, due to their titles and subject matter, I was
nevertheless permitted to possess). A part-time library
engagement (and a friendly library &quot;director&quot;) also
allowed me to order in on loan any book I might desire. The
entire situation, despite the shabby surroundings and lack of
intellectual companionship, was not unlike a very productive
sabbatical from my former routines. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus I began early on in my study to think again
about things that I had experienced in Mexico, to consider
mankind's early and ubiquitous use of psychedelic medicines
especially with regard to the aboriginal practices of shamanism,
early religion, the curing arts. And given the universal
importance of psychedelic plants and preparations for early man
it was not a great extrapolation (but a surprising one
nonetheless) to begin to suspect that the use of these sacred
drugs must go right back to the very origins of man; they must
have played a role in his evolution from proto-humans, from
whatever species it was that was definitely advanced animal, but
definitely not-yet-mankind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever the characteristics of this proto-human
species were, <a name="back1"></a><a href="#footnote1">(1)</a> it
is generally agreed that they were hunter-gatherers who explored
widely for food from many diverse sources. Evidence also
indicates that climatic changes and other factors had provided a
strong impetus for proto-man to migrate from his African home to
the most distant regions of the earth, thus bringing him into
contact with the diverse psychedelic flora of many new habitats.
The period of this migration, the middle to late Paleolithic,
coincides precisely with evidence of the birth of human culture
illustrated by the recovery of artifacts such as complex tools,
body adornments, artwork, evidence of music, etc. McKenna <a
name="back2"></a><a href="#footnote2">(2)</a> has presented
several persuasive arguments indicating that such generally
agreed characteristics which typified the proto-human species
would have ensured that its members frequently came into contact
with a range of psychedelic plants. But to hypothesize a role for
psychedelic plants in the evolution of man was easy, to discover
what kind of psychological and cognitive leap was entailed in
that miracle of evolution, and what function psychedelic plants
played therein, especially whether their influence was a
necessary, merely facilitating, or just coincidental factor, <i>that
</i>would require some diligent study and inventive thought. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although I had studied chemistry and physics in a
top university, my knowledge of the biological sciences was quite
limited. In trying to get some ideas about what might have been
the psychological condition of proto-man, and how psychedelics
might have affected that condition to bring about major change, I
naturally started with only the most elementary of conceptual
tools, the first of which being that somewhat discredited concept
called instinct. To the psychologists of the last century the
existence of instinct was self-evident. William James,
introducing an extensive chapter on the subject in his famous
opus <i>The Principles of Psychology </i>wrote, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Instinct is usually defined as the faculty of acting in
    such a way as to produce certain ends, without foresight of
    the ends, and without previous education in the performance.
    That instincts, as thus defined, exist on an enormous scale
    in the animal kingdom needs no proof. <a name="back3"></a><a
    href="#footnote3">(3)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet soon the Behaviorists, in a half-century
crusade to objectify the science of psychology, would first
dispense with the terms, and later with the very concepts of many
such self-evident entities for lack of simple experimental
techniques capable of isolating, measuring, and controlling them.
The difficulty or inability to accurately measure the predictions
of a model is, of course, a serious flaw, for the purpose of a
model is precisely to suggest experiments that <i>will </i>yield
meaningful measurement. The Behaviorist stratagem is thus
understandable, and would probably have been better justified had
the science of psychology already attained a level of perfection
comparable to that of early 20th Century physics or chemistry. In
retrospect, and in consideration of the still very rudimentary
state of the discipline, the strategy must now be judged as one
of desperation, for despite the Behaviorists' long and powerful
onslaught, concepts such as instinct and consciousness remain far
too vital to justify the elimination of the terms from the
lexicon of psychology. As I have already pointed out, the study
of consciousness is now enjoying a major and fruitful revival,
and I think that I can show how at least one aspect of what has
been called instinct is now describable, and perhaps even
measurable, in physiological terms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the start of my quest therefore, before I had
worked out some of the cognitive and neurological mechanisms for
the Habit Routine Model, I necessarily found myself toying with
the concept of instinct. Believing that the influence of
psychedelic drugs on proto-humans might have been a <i>necessary </i>catalyst
for the rapid <a name="back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">(4)</a>
transformation to culturally modern <i>Homo sapiens,</i> there
seemed two possibilities to explore. Either the psychedelics
might have <i>added </i>something to the psychological abilities
of proto-man (which turned out to be the conclusion of McKenna's
views), or conversely, perhaps the repeated and cumulative
effects of psychedelic drugs had <i>eliminated an impediment </i>to
further psychological evolution, an impediment which, up until
that point in evolution, had been not an impediment but a
characteristic favorable or essential for the reproduction and
survival of the species. And that characteristic, it seemed,
should be something very much like an instinct, an innate
psychological tendency governing the normal behavior of the
species. I am assuming that, in the ultimate stages, the change
from proto-man to humankind was preponderantly if not entirely a <i>psychological
</i>change, the facilitating physiological changes such as
greatly enlarged brain capacity having already been present. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The latter hypothesis seemed the more powerful, for
if it had been necessary to <i>add </i>to the abilities of
proto-man, the normal processes of evolution are always willing
and able to provide such addition. This is the whole idea of
evolution. Additions to the abilities and design features of a
species follow necessarily from the essentials of the process.
Thus the hypothesis that psychedelic drugs might have <i>added </i>to
the abilities of proto-man would have carried with it the
probability that such addition would not, in the long run, have
been necessary. The mere passage of time, and further selection
pressures, would have surely led to the same result. Under this
hypothesis, the psychedelics would only have provided a
facilitation to an ongoing process, or perhaps been merely
incidental to it. It didn't seem that the ubiquitous use of
psychedelics by early man would have resulted from a merely
coincidental influence; the great importance of these sacred
plants for early man in every corner of the earth indicated to me
that they had been essential and necessary for the evolution of
humankind. If this were the case, their prevalence of use and
central importance for early man would naturally follow. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But if evolution relentlessly provides any required
new feature, we also see the strange result that occurs sometimes
when a feature becomes obsolete, the case of the vestigial
vermiform appendix on the large intestine being the example known
to all. Evolution is remarkably efficient at slowly bringing
about any design feature that is required for the production of
new abilities and new species, but does not pay much attention to
the intentional removal of design features that have become
obsolete, even if they become mildly unfavorable as in the case
of the appendix. Design features may persist through sheer
conservatism or &quot;force of habit&quot;, as for example the
persistence of a full range of digital bones in the fins of
whales and other once-terrestrial species; and if the feature has
been an important one at some stage of development, it will be
very difficult to eliminate. One would suspect that such a
feature would have to become a significant disadvantage before
selection pressures and the normal course of evolution would
bring about its gradual removal. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now if evolution could produce physiological
&quot;skeuomorphs&quot; (design features which have persisted
despite becoming disused or non-functioning <a name="back5"></a><a
href="#footnote5">(5)</a>), then it seemed that the same process
might have occurred in the realm of psychology. Perhaps
instincts, once valuable to a species or range of species
(perhaps even the entire animal kingdom), might have become not
only skeuomorphic, but a factor which would impede further
psychological development in a given species. Although such a
skeuomorphic instinct would present no disadvantage to the
species in its given form, it might well tend to prevent a
radical evolutionary jump such as that between animal and
humankind. The existence of evolutionary dead-ends in the
physiological sense <a name="back6"></a><a href="#footnote6">(6)</a>
might illustrate the parallel concept of the case of the advanced
ape who had every physiological capacity necessary to be a
philosopher, a mathematician, yet... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My hypothesis began to take shape: an instinctual
or innate psychological drive or tendency that had been an
essential and <i>defining </i>feature of advanced animal life had
become the barrier which prevented proto-man from achieving the
most important of all evolutionary quantum leaps. And it was this
barrier, this very powerful and efficient psychological trait or
instinct which had been eroded and then (at least temporarily)
suspended by proto-man's exposure to psychedelic drugs.</p>

<p></p>

<hr width="50%">

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It would be valuable at this point to provide a
definition and examples of the concept of instinct as it applies
to my theory. As I hinted above, I intend to show how the
instinct in question is actually something describable in
physiological terms, but a clearer understanding results, I
think, from treading the same conceptual path from instinct to
brain systems that I myself took in constructing the theory. A
few general suggestions concerning the various possible
mechanisms of instinct, and what kind of information constitutes
an instinct might help to alleviate some objections to the
concept by the more demanding adherents of hard science. Perhaps
we might also find that what was once piled together under the
label &quot;instinct&quot; is actually a range of quite different
and independently organized processes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is quite true, for example, that we have not the
foggiest notion of how fledgling cuckoos, at the end of their
fall migration, find their way to the same trees in Africa where
their parents are nesting, despite the fact that the parents
leave Europe a week or more in advance of their progeny. Saying
that the young cuckoos have an instinct to do so tells us very
little, and it is far-fetched to suppose that the parent birds
&quot;teach&quot; their progeny how to make the voyage before
their early depart. Equally improbable, despite
&quot;nothing-but&quot; arguments of
&quot;what-else-could-it-be?&quot;, is the proposal that cuckoo
genes or nervous systems come equipped with maps of Africa. The
use of &quot;instinct&quot; as a mere label that only pretends to
impart an understanding of how such a phenomenon might arise has
justifiably drawn criticism. Thus the distinguished
anthropologist Gregory Bateson has commented, (in a
&quot;Metalogue&quot;, between Father and Daughter), </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Daughter: Daddy, what is an instinct?<br>
    Father: An instinct, my dear, is a explanatory principle.<br>
    D: But what does it explain?<br>
    F: Anything&#151;almost anything at all. Anything you want it
    to explain.<br>
    D: Don't be silly. It doesn't explain gravity.<br>
    F: No. But that is because nobody wants &quot;instinct&quot;
    to explain gravity. If they did, it would explain it. We
    could simply say that the moon has an instinct whose strength
    varies inversely as the square of the distance&#133;<br>
    D: But that's nonsense, Daddy.<br>
    F: Yes, surely. But it was you who mentioned
    &quot;instinct,&quot; not I.<br>
    D: All right-but then what does explain gravity?<br>
    F: Nothing, my dear, because gravity is an explanatory
    principle.<br>
    D: Oh... <a name="back7"></a><a href="#footnote7">(7)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such an instinct as cuckoos have still evades
description in terms of brain systems or genetic codes, and thus
to call it an instinct is about as far as we can go. In the last
century, due to a very primitive understanding of the nervous
system, practically all habitual behavior of animals had to be
labeled instinct. &quot;Early psychologists sought to identify a
drive for every aspect of behavior: a hunger drive responsible
for feeding, a thirst drive, a sex drive, etc. It proved
impossible to classify animal behavior in this way without
resorting to a <i>reductio ad absurdum </i>involving drives for
thumb-sucking, nail-biting, and other minutiae of behavior.&quot;
<a name="back8"></a><a href="#footnote8">(8)</a> The examples of
proposed instincts for thirst and hunger illustrate how an
inability to explain a trait of behavior and the resulting
retreat into mere labeling, can later be resolved with further
knowledge. Science has today discovered a great deal about the
physiological systems which control and produce hunger, thirst,
and more. With more advanced knowledge of the brain, some
phenomena which were once called instincts, and which were
indistinguishable from other phenomena like the cuckoo's
navigational abilities, can be shown to result from elementary
brain-systems operation. Such will be the case with the
&quot;instinct&quot; I have in mind as a candidate for
proto-man's impediment. <a name="back9"></a><a href="#footnote9">(9)</a>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The perceptive reader will certainly, remembering
my cognitive and neurological models of earlier on, see where
this argument is going. But the pathway that was followed, I
believe, is not only an interesting view of how one model leads
to the next in theory building, but also of how the pieces of
this large puzzle were manipulated to form an overall and
convincing picture. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At first, and very crudely, it seemed to me that
proto-man might have had some kind of instinct that could be
viewed as a &quot;narrow-mindedness&quot;, a strong repression
of, or inability to use the obvious and recently expanded
theoretical capacity of his brain. I soon coined a nice term for
the effect, the <i>sophiolytic instinct</i>, a behavioral drive
that prevented the ape from becoming wise, that actually
&quot;cured&quot; him of any tendency to become wise, for an ape
who suddenly decided to ape not an ape, but a Socrates, would not
be very popular with his mates! He would be excluded from the
group, become solitary with no chance of reproducing either his
weird psychological abilities (through teaching perhaps) nor any
physiological &quot;adaptions&quot; that had suddenly enabled him
to use his tremendous brain capacity more fully than his
contemporaries. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The model began to improve as I realized that such
a sophiolytic instinct should be part of a pair of
characteristics which would be precisely what all advanced animal
life would profit greatly from. An animal <i>should </i>have a
much greater mental and psychological capacity than it needs in
normal everyday life, for that capacity would be of enormous
value in crisis situations, or other infrequently encountered
situations where the animal is called upon to be creative in some
sense. Obtaining food from a new source, coping with unusual
threats to life or habitat, and many other imaginable situations
would demand a level of &quot;creativity&quot; in an animal. If
extra brain capacity could provide for overcoming merely habitual
and stereotyped behavior in times of need, this should obviously
be a favorable evolutionary development in the animal kingdom. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But likewise, it seemed that there would have to be
a strong tendency for an animal <i>not </i>to use his creative
abilities on a daily basis. Any creative potentials of an animal
would have to be dormant or actively inhibited in the normal
routines of existence, and this would also favor survival and
reproduction because it would lend great stability and coherence
of behavior between the members of a group, and within species as
well; individuality would be suppressed during routine existence
in favor of group and species stability. Indeed many species have
mechanisms for isolating and expelling members of a reproductive
group who exhibit unusual or disruptive behaviors. Such behavior
would often have indicated that a given individual might be
diseased, or afflicted with some genetic defect, so a species'
ability to isolate such individuals would be a favorable
characteristic for maintaining species integrity. These
mechanisms and the sophiolytic instinct would therefore ensure
that members of a group all &quot;toe the line&quot; and do not
become too much the individual, in spite of the possession of
cognitive capacities going sometimes far beyond those required
for routine existence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The evolution of animal life is not at all a matter
of one exceptional individual providing genetic material for the
future, but of the slow selection of many <i>slightly </i>better
adapted individuals providing for future inheritance. The
hypothesis of excess cognitive capability coupled with a
mechanism for the normal suppression of this capability seemed to
fit these requirements quite well. <a name="back10"></a><a
href="#footnote10">(10)</a> And what was more, the dual
characteristic should become more and more important with the
complexity of the species considered: the most advanced animals
in terms of social situation, reproductive requirements,
nourishment-obtaining abilities, protection strategies, etc.,
should be the very animals which would profit most from excess
and reserve cognitive abilities, and it would be in these very
species that the most efficient, powerful and precisely applied
suppression of these abilities in everyday routine would be
required. The maximums here would have attained their summit in
the proto-human species, the recent and sudden increase in
cranial capacity indicating a vastly increased cognitive reserve,
and my speculations indicating that the restraining mechanism,
the proposed sophiolytic instinct, must also have attained a
corresponding power and efficiency. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This scenario seemed to provide a paradox for
evolution. On the one hand, in order for evolution to produce
modern man, it would have had to proceed through stages in which
animals gained more and more neurological and cognitive ability,
and especially a <i>reserve </i>of such ability, yet an essential
requirement of this gain would be that it needed to be
increasingly suppressed for normal routines of daily existence.
It would therefore become impossible for an advanced animal to
use this cognitive power <i>at will</i>, to enter a <i>mode of
life, by conscious choice, </i>in which the creative ability
might be used routinely rather than only <i>in extremis.</i> To
break through this evolutionary barrier between proto-human and <i>Homo
sapiens </i>would require an extraordinary and <i>external</i>
influence capable of dissolving this barrier. All the
neurological equipment would be in place, thanks to the normal
evolutionary processes, but the final breakthrough would have to
be something that the normal processes of evolution could not
provide. And the drugs which enabled that cognitive breakthrough
were conveniently scattered about the planet in plenitude... </p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; If these hypotheses are at all valuable, it should
be possible to see evidence in animal behavior of the processes
they describe. The idea that animals, even lowly insects, have
quite amazing abilities available for use in case of novel
challenges has been experimentally demonstrated for many
different species. Greater cognitive abilities are likewise
reflected by correspondingly larger nervous system capacity
compared with similar species exhibiting less versatile behavior.
A lengthy review of recent work on &quot;intelligence&quot; in
animals is not necessary here, a few examples will suffice to
show convincingly that not only our recent evolutionary
neighbors, apes and chimpanzees, have significant cognitive
reserves, but that the hypothesis of excess cognitive capacity
describes a universal trait of animal life. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although recent presentations by Gould &amp; Gould <a
name="back11"></a><a href="#footnote11">(11)</a>, Griffin <a
name="back12"></a><a href="#footnote12">(12)</a>, Byrne <a
name="back13"></a><a href="#footnote13">(13)</a>, and others show
many examples of rudimentary insight, context-switching
intelligence, and conceptual thinking in animals as diverse as
beavers, honeyguides, and even insects such as wasps and bees,
certain hard-science advocates have done their best to raise
objections against such evidence. Donald Griffin has reviewed
such argument and presented an admirable rebuttal to what he
considers to be a taboo against considering that non-human
animals might have subjective mental experiences or an ability to
&quot;think&quot;, albeit in very primitive ways. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The taboo...has become a serious impediment to scientific
    investigation. Effective indoctrination&#151;often
    accomplished by nonverbal signals of
    disapproval&#151;inhibits students and young scientists from
    venturing into this forbidden territory, and those that do so
    encounter criticism and ridicule. One result is that students
    of animal behavior are inhibited from reporting versatile
    behavior that suggests conscious thinking; and scientific
    journals sometimes refuse to publish data or interpretations
    that support the inference of animal consciousness. <a
    name="back14"></a><a href="#footnote14">(14)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I will mention only examples of intelligence in
apes and chimpanzees, because here the weight of evidence is
exceptional. In suggesting some ideas about the importance of
young animals' play for cognitive development, Richard Byrne <a
name="back15"></a><a href="#footnote15">(15)</a> mentions a
seeming paradox: Gorillas in captivity regularly show extensive
skills in the use of tools, yet in the wild, tool use in gorillas
is practically non-existent. He notes that only young chimpanzees
and humans &quot;invest much time in play with detached objects.
But under the artificial conditions of captivity, young gorillas
also play with objects&quot;. Byrne's proposal that infant play
with objects might be a causal explanation of the paradox may
have some validity for gorillas, but apparently ignores that many
other tool-using species also do not exhibit play with detached
objects in juveniles. But he also notes that &quot;gorillas
evidently have the <i>latent potential </i>to play with objects
in childhood, and to use tools to solve problems in adulthood,
yet they do neither in the wild-why?&quot; [my emphasis]. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The question is answered with the hypothesis of a
sophiolytic instinct being the factor which all but guarantees
that much advanced behavior capability in animals will remain as
&quot;latent potentials&quot; under normal conditions, especially
if we understand that the sophiolytic instinct must be a powerful
and primary one, surpassed only perhaps by instincts for sexual
behavior without which, of course, there would be no animals
around to study. Without the sophiolytic instinct, the force
ensuring group stability, survival, and reproduction, individuals
would have constantly been far more subject to the vicissitudes
of the environment, to dispersal and separation from potential
mates, to dangers resulting from their constant
&quot;inventiveness&quot; and individuality in dealing with
everyday situations better handled with habit than innovation.
The latent potential which Byrne concedes is evident for apes, is
a simple and elegant illustration for the concept of the dual
characteristic of excess cognitive capacity and the sophiolytic
instinct. Byrne asks practically the same question later on,
(p158): </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Ape mentality: why not more? ...But we are still
    confronted with a paradox: if cognitive abilities are so
    useful in social and other spheres, as we like to imagine
    they are, why aren't these demonstrations much, much more
    common and obvious in these animals which apparently can show
    the cognitive skills occasionally? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nicholas Humphrey, in his paper &quot;The Social
Function of the Intellect&quot; asks the same question: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We are thus faced with a conundrum. It has been repeatedly
    demonstrated in the artificial situations of the
    psychological laboratory that anthropoid apes possess
    impressive powers of creative reasoning, yet these feats of
    intelligence seem simply to not have any parallels in the
    behaviour of the same animals in their natural environment. I
    have yet to hear of any example from the field of a
    chimpanzee (or for that matter a Bushman) using his full
    capacity for inferential reasoning in the solution of a
    biologically relevant practical problem. Someone may retort
    that if an ethologist had kept watch on Einstein through a
    pair of field glasses he might well have come to the
    conclusion that Einstein too had a hum-drum mind. However,
    that is just the point: Einstein, like the chimpanzees,
    displayed his genius at rare times in 'artificial'
    situations&#151;he did not use it, for he did not need to use
    it, in the common world of practical affairs. <a
    name="back16"></a><a href="#footnote16">(16)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For apes especially, the answer is that the
sophiolytic instinct, in these advanced animals, has attained the
height of its development and effectiveness, for it needs to
restrain a nervous system with tremendous inherent capability.
And in light of Humphrey's comments I might add something
obvious, perhaps painfully so, to which I shall return later: the
sophiolytic instinct is certainly not something that miraculously
disappeared once humankind was on the scene, and its power (like
the power of other important instincts) is negligibly reduced by
awareness of its effect, or of its skeuomorphic nature for man. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us consider another example of excess cognitive
capacity, in the chimpanzee. No-one would disagree with the
proposal that the use of language is one of the most advanced
cognitive abilities that has developed. Thus, in the exploration
of potential cognitive abilities of our closest evolutionary
neighbors, the attempt to teach some form of language to
chimpanzees has been going on for a long time. As usual, any
apparent success in this project has been immediately met with
objections, mostly from the lingering remnants of the Behaviorist
School of Thought (at least they readily admit that <i>they
themselves </i>think!). A difficulty has been that chimpanzees
simply do not have the physiology for speech (as opposed to <i>neuro</i>physiology),
hence spoken language of any complexity is <i>physically,</i> but
not necessarily cognitively impossible for them. Thus attempts
have been made to teach chimps various types of sign language as
used by the deaf, and quite good results have been obtained. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The work of B.T. and R.A. Gardner with a chimp
named Washoe constituted a breakthrough, in which the animal was
taught to use correctly about 130 words of the American Sign
Language over a period of four years. Of particular note was: the
achievement of this and other chimpanzees to invent novel word
combinations for new objects and concepts; the fact that chimps
in some of these projects began to communicate <i>between
themselves </i>using the language; and evidence that there began
a <i>cultural transmission </i>of the newly acquired ability. For
example, Washoe's adopted son, even though the experimenters
never used the sign language in his presence, nevertheless
learned over fifty signs directly from Washoe. <a name="back17"></a><a
href="#footnote17">(17)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the most striking example of language
ability in chimpanzees has come from the work of David Premack
and of Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and Duane Rumbaugh. These workers
succeeded in teaching chimpanzees a <i>symbol-based </i>language,
using either colored plastic shapes to denote words
(&quot;lexigrams&quot;), or in another approach the use of a
keyboard-based language in which keys are marked with <i>arbitrary,
</i>not iconic or representational symbols: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The most ambitious project to teach language to
    chimpanzees was initiated by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and Duane
    Rumbaugh. With their colleagues they developed a
    keyboard-based language. Each key is marked with an arbitrary
    symbol. When pressed, a key lights up and its symbol appears
    in sequence on a screen, so the chimpanzees can keep track of
    their lexigram sequences. The researchers used a word-order
    grammar with a generic interrogative symbol to initiate
    question sentences. The chimpanzees in these experiments are
    typically taught a vocabulary of 75 to 90 words. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The computer-mediated keyboard approach allows
    unprecedented accuracy in recording the linguistic progress
    of chimpanzees. Analysis of the painful transition from the
    one-word stage of using a lexigram to identify an object to a
    two-word level that permits interrogation (by both humans and
    the chimps) shows that in these experiments the symbols
    initially <i>are</i> learned as operants for obtaining things
    (usually food). But once the two-word concept is mastered
    for, say, asking the name of a particular food, the chimp
    realizes how it applies to all other objects. This kind of
    mental breakthrough opens new horizons for the chimp and at
    the same time demonstrates that they understand concepts like
    &quot;food&quot; and &quot;tool.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In a further extension of language use, the
    keyboard-based approach has allowed two chimpanzees to
    communicate with each other. The chimps had to learn that the
    keyboard and screen could be used for two-way exchanges; just
    mastering the techniques for answering researchers' questions
    or making requests was not enough. But once the chimpanzees
    grasped the idea of exchanging information, they were able to
    cooperate to solve problems. To take a typical example, one
    chimp would figure out what sort of tool it needed to get at
    food left by a researcher, and then use the keyboard to ask
    the other animal (in an adjoining room) for that implement;
    the second chimp, who was unaware of the particular problem,
    would pass the requested tool through a small opening. Again,
    there was every evidence of a conceptual threshold having
    suddenly been reached: training accelerated and error rates
    plummeted. Moreover, the chimps began to engage in what seems
    to be interactive play via the keyboard link. <a
    name="back18"></a><a href="#footnote18">(18)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The idea of &quot;a conceptual threshold having
been reached,&quot; is precisely what would be expected from my
hypotheses: the excess inherent cognitive capacity of the chimps
is sufficient for significant language abilities, but chimps in
the wild have never achieved these abilities because there is a
powerful, if not almost unbreachable barrier which needs to be
overcome to allow a specific manifestation of excess cognitive
capacity to be used routinely. Thus it requires great and careful
effort to teach chimps the rudiments of language in experiments
like these, but once a certain stage is reached, once the
significance of the new situation and ability has temporarily
nullified the sophiolytic instinct, the new abilities themselves
become part of the normal routine of the chimps, and are even
taught to youngsters independent from further human training. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I should mention one further example in which even
greater abstract reasoning ability in chimpanzees has been
demonstrated. This is a particularly valuable body of evidence
for my hypotheses since it illustrates that a particular
cognitive ability, once liberated from control by the sophiolytic
instinct, may then facilitate the liberation of further cognitive
abilities which would not have been possible for the animal to
learn or employ without having achieved the first ability. I will
use another extended quote from Gould &amp; Gould to describe the
work, the title of this section is &quot;Chimpanzee Logic&quot;: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Though the reasoning abilities of keyboard-trained
    chimpanzees have not yet been explored in any systematic way,
    Premack has tried teaching a variety of logical operations to
    both language-trained and untrained chimpanzees. In the
    simplest tests, the chimps were faced with the task of'
    labeling pairs of objects as either &quot;same&quot; or
    &quot;different.&quot; This problem is unlike the
    same-different concept tests described earlier. In the usual
    form of the task the experimenter shows an example and then a
    pair of objects, one of which is the same as the example and
    the other different; the animal is rewarded for choosing the
    member of the pair that is different. In the Premack study,
    however, the two objects to be categorized were presented
    simultaneously. Language-trained chimps learned this
    discrimination, whereas untrained chimps did not. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Premack also attempted to teach the concept of
    analogies: A is to B as C is to D-lock is to key as can is to
    can opener, to choose one of the most abstract examples he
    used. The usual format of the test was to present an
    incomplete analogy and offer a choice of three different
    objects to finish the verbal equation. Language-trained
    chimpanzees eventually handled these tasks with nearly an 80
    percent accuracy rate; chimps without language training, on
    the other hand, never mastered even the simplest analogy:
    &quot;apple is to apple as banana is to....&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Another task familiar to students of child
    development is proportionality. Language- trained chimps
    could choose an object&#151;a half circle rather than a full
    or three-quarter circle&#151;that corresponded to the
    proportion visible in the test object (a half-filled glass of
    water, for instance). Chimps without language training could
    master this task only so long as the choice objects they had
    to select from were similar to the test object.
    Interestingly, Premack found that his language-trained chimp
    had no difficulty with a related concept that proves very
    difficult for children: conservation of volume. Young
    children judge the amount of liquid in a glass or the mass of
    clay in a lump by its height or length; thus they behave as
    though there is more water in a tall, thin glass than in a
    short, squat tumbler, even if they have seen each filled from
    identical containers of liquid. The language-trained chimp
    tested on this task required no instruction: from the outset
    she recognized the two amounts as being the same. To be fair,
    though, this chimp was nearly 20 years old at the time, and
    she had had plenty of opportunity to learn the basic facts of
    fluid physics before testing ever began. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, Premack has taught language-trained
    chimps to complete cause-and-effect sentences of the form
    &quot;whole apple plus X produces cut apple,&quot; offering
    three objects (a bowl of water, a knife, and a pencil, for
    instance) as possibilities for X; in other tests, the goal
    was to supply the final item, as in &quot;dry sponge plus
    bowl of water produces Y.&quot; The language-trained chimp
    mastered these tasks with a minimum of training; untrained
    chimps failed. <a name="back19"></a><a href="#footnote19">(19)</a>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Clearly, advanced apes have extensive latent
language capabilities, and even what would have to be called a
capability for logical reasoning, and one wonders what might be
developed by these animals by the training of a hundred
generations of chimps, first by human instructors but later by
cultural transmission. Unfortunately such experiments are
difficult to carry out without access to a time machine, and
physicists seem loathe to provide us with either a theory or the
technique for constructing one. But extensive experimentation
attempting to use psychedelic drugs as facilitators for this
process are called for, and might well reveal a facilitation,
perhaps cumulative, for the animals' rapid overcoming of
sophiolysis and resultant achievement of quantum leaps in their
cognitive development. Again unfortunately, government
restrictions on psychedelic research, and especially a strong
reluctance for scientists to engage in research with such
&quot;discredited drugs of abuse&quot; make it certain that such
work will not soon be attempted. Perhaps the absurdity of my
comment on time machines will call attention to the even greater
absurdity of the impossibility of undertaking, in the present
social, political, and scientific climate, even the most
elementary of psychedelic research projects. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gould and Gould continue with a few careful
comments about what the chimpanzee research might indicate, and
certainly caution is necessary when research has barely begun in
a field. But the evidence outlined above, if not yet sufficient
for other conclusions, clearly demonstrates the validity of the
concept of excess cognitive capacity and the sophiolytic
instinct. Yet leaving the model at the stage of postulation of
yet another mysterious instinct without physiological basis would
not have amounted to much more than another instance of New-Age
technobabble if the facilitating neurocognitive mechanisms for
its operation could not be found or hypothesized. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The next stage of my model-building toward the
psychedelic theory therefore involved an attempt to see how the
sophiolytic instinct might actually operate on a physiological
level. The fact that it seemed to be such an important instinct
hinted that a fundamental operation of the nervous system might
produce what at first would be seen as an instinct, much as the
discovery of fundamental neurological operations had elaborated
the nature of such former &quot;instincts&quot; as those for
hunger, thirst, or breathing. The idea that instincts were
essentially habits, or exhibited themselves as such, and the
realization that the implementation of a habit could only be
using the contents of long-term memory in an unconscious way, led
to the models described in chapters three and four. These models
were then seen to have a wide explanatory power across a range of
phenomena, as my examples in these chapters showed. Thus the
sophiolytic instinct became the primary cognitive operation of
the nervous system of all advanced animal life, the habit routine
search function. Now it was no longer necessary to posit a
skeuomorphic instinct, of mysterious origin and operation, to see
how the result that such an entity would produce was instead
brought about by a normal brain operation utilizing brain areas
common to all mammals right back to the most primitive. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sophiolytic instinct thus turned out to be
merely a descriptive artifact resulting from the way animal
nervous systems have evolved to operate, the HRS system as the
primary cognitive operation, and the requirement of activation of
the SD (significance detection) system, dependent on unusual ENV
(environmental) events, for overruling of the HRS patterns as
templates for thinking2 and behavior. As to the question of why
evolution produced a nervous system that detected, not reality
directly, but a representation of current reality drawn from
memory data through the process of HRS, I think that it can be
seen that at each stage of animal evolution, the former type of
nervous system would always lend a greater survival value than
the latter. With the very first organisms that became capable of
&quot;taking a decision&quot;, it seems to me that such decision
taking should be a far more efficient and dependable process if
it were based on habit rather than fresh analysis of the entire
environmental input which, at a minimum, would require far more
time and &quot;brain power&quot;. Thus we can see the normal and
necessary parameters of evolution as the factor which has
produced the &quot;sophiolytic instinct&quot; which is the
&quot;suppresser of creativity&quot;, the characteristic that we
humans are still very much slaves to in lieu of active, strenuous
and constant striving to free ourselves from our in-built
&quot;narrow-mindedness&quot;. Needless to say, it is my opinion
that the judicious use of psychedelic drugs to aid in this effort
is precisely the Rx that is called for, just as it has been for
the ancient Greeks at Eleusis, for the Native Americans, for so
many other tribes down through history. </p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="footnote9"></a>(9) From the foregoing,
instinct thus seems a mere label for phenomena which have not yet
been explained on a more reductionist level. But perhaps there is
a more hopeful future for the term, and phenomena of behavior and
variations thereof which can profit from a new conception of the
term. Recent advances in the science of chaos and complexity
might suggest that at least some instincts, those not explainable
in simple physiological terms for instance, might be something
like state attractors for behavior patterns, analogous to the
attractors seen in other complex adaptive systems. See for
example <i>Complexity, Life at the Edge of Chaos, </i>Roger
Lewin, MacMillan 1992, especially the example on page 176, and
also <i>The Origins of Order, </i>Stuart Kauffman, Oxford
University Press 1993. An instinct seen as a biological state
attractor for behavior would be more like a mathematical function
than some undefined &quot;innate drive&quot; supposedly hidden
away in an organism's &quot;genes&quot;, and this behavioral
attractor would guide the formation of habit routines in an
individual animal. Under the influence of such a function, habit
routines in different animals of the same group or species would
be very similar, but yet show the small variations commonly seen
in instinctual behavior. The idea of instinct as a probabilistic
state attractor for the formation of habit routine is perhaps
only a more modern description of William James' idea that
&quot;most instincts are implanted for the sake of giving rise to
habits, and that, this purpose accomplished, the instincts
themselves...consequently fade away.&quot; (<i>The Principles of
Psychology, ibid., </i>vol. 2, p402). Since my conception of the
sophiolytic instinct is reducible to the operation of brain
systems however, these speculations would not be of use to the
present work, and I will leave their development for some future
project. <a href="#back9">(back)</a> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="footnote10"></a>(10) The &quot;dual
characteristic&quot; might at first seem to be tautological: a
&quot;reserve&quot; capacity would necessarily imply the
selective or only occasional use of that capacity, otherwise it
would not be &quot;in reserve&quot;. But if we concentrate first
on the aspect of suppression, and then see that this is only an
introductory and oblique way of understanding what an important
cognitive system of the brain is naturally producing, and
further, that other brain mechanisms allow the over-ruling of the
first system, then we see that the tautology is merely the result
of a rudimentary description of the overall phenomena. Here again
is illustrated how an introductory model, primitive and not very
useful in itself, can lead nevertheless to more advanced models
overcoming the original limitations. <a href="#back10">(back)</a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Early Man's relationship with the psychedelic
plants he discovered was a symbiotic one. These plants, which had
long before evolved biochemical mechanisms to produce substances
whose ultimate, if incidental function was not to be realized for
millions of years, suddenly provided the key whereby the very
process of evolution might overcome a most formidable barrier. <i>Homo
sapiens,</i> the (potentially) Wise Man was born, and dozens of
obscure species of fungi, flowering vines, roots, seeds, trees
and cacti, became revered partners with him to produce an
experiment in evolution which would truly be a final experiment:
Either it would eventually succeed in producing an enlightened
world society in which the rule of the Perennial Philosophy
occurred not through force of authority but simple good sense,
enabling humankind to undertake a conscious and deliberately
ecological stewardship of his small corner of the universe, or it
would end in the probable destruction of all advanced life on the
planet. There would be no turning back once the barrier of the
sophiolytic instinct had been breached. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The symbiotic partnership at first enabled a
relatively small population of Early Man to prosper, to migrate
rapidly from his birthplace to all the corners of the earth, to
initiate a veritable explosion of culture wherever he went, and
to displace all more primitive species and races of archaic man,
the descendants of <i>Homo erectus</i> which had migrated out of
Africa eons before. But as the experiment progressed and culture,
technology, and thus power accumulated, repudiation of the
beneficial symbiosis sometimes occurred in the various regions of
early civilization. Unfortunately it is a simple fact that
accumulated power and technology may, with the greatest of ease,
be used with malign intent, and thus be used by the ignorant to
enforce their folly on the wise. Wisdom is by definition
incapable of using force, technological force at least, to
assuage ignorance. Advantageous Ends are simply not obtainable by
Deplorable Means. As the first organized societies grew and
accumulated technology, some inevitably succumbed to the
temptations which occur all too easily to the ignorant, including
the subjugation and eradication of neighbors whose continuing
wisdom threatened their power structures. The catalytic factor
which had made culture and technology possible in the first place
was, again and again, ignored, and one by one, such societies
declined and were extinguished, their achievements to be
forgotten along with their perversions. And so the story
continues. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the early years of my work, and with the spirit
of the 1960's still fresh, it seemed that it was yet possible to
ameliorate by stages and eventually reverse the destructive
momentum that had been building for centuries in the most modern
and recent, and world-encompassing of civilizations, Western
Civilization (for want of a better term). The Twentieth Century
had provided horrors which were the logical extrapolation and
epitome of many centuries of psychedelic ignorance, and there was
something new: the horrors of the Twentieth Century were in
essence terminal ones for they could no longer be exceeded
without a resulting collapse of the civilization which had
brought them about, and the novelty was that this time, the
collapse would preclude the possibility of picking up the pieces
once the ignorance and stupidity of the powerful had run its
course. But having been born into, and grown up within the best
and the worst that civilization had ever offered, it was natural
to hope that the good could be preserved, the bad at least slowly
corrected, a small group of wise persons begin to re-establish
the ancient symbiosis at first stealthily and cautiously, the
resulting new vision becoming eventually an irresistible
ground-swell. Today I am not so sure. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The scenes of my several attempts to be a modern
shaman for the tribe of Western Man provided contradictory and
paradoxical results. In one sense, I was attempting for the first
time a &quot;scientific&quot; rather than ritual and intuitive
approach to shamanism. The teaching and experience of the
psychedelic state was not to be interpreted, as in previous
societies, in terms of myth and ritual, but in terms of a truly
scientific understanding of the eternal religious questions
concerning origins, destinies, and meanings of the life-process.
This understanding would extend even to the biological processes
of the human nervous system which corresponded to the psychedelic
state of awareness. It seemed possible for the first time to
answer many of the questions for which Early Man could only
compose tales and enact symbolic ritual, it seemed that we might
finally grasp where the Essential Mystery of life lay. We would
be able to see how all the religions, all the ancient
philosophies, were describing a truth with means inadequate to
the task, so that their result was not wrong but merely
incomplete, each description like that of one of the blind men
exploring some local region of that famous elephant. Now for the
first time we seemed to have all the tools necessary to step back
and view the beast all-at-once, and use the former limited
techniques to confirm what we now could take in at a glance. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another important difference in what modern
&quot;scientific&quot; shamanism was attempting was that the
psychedelic experience had in the past been a factor in human <i>evolution</i>,
whereas now we were attempting to make it an essential part of
our technology, a guide enabling the wise use of that technology.
It was obvious that we could not achieve an evolutionary effect
on such a rapid timescale, we could not expect to recapitulate
the phylogeny of the effects of psychedelic experience on Early
Man with the ontogeny of modern psychedelic research. The new
function of psychedelic experience, although helping the
individual to overcome the disadvantages and limitations of
habit-routine governed existence, just like it had done for Early
Man, was not this time a causative factor in the <i>establishment</i>
of culture and civilization, but would instead have to correct a
psychedelically long-ignorant civilization from the path of
self-destruction. Such an accomplishment had never before been
realized, at least not on the global scale required today. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The intent of this approach was therefore to be
directed not just to the benefit of a local tribe as in former
ages, or even the now global tribe of psychedelic seekers, but at
a corrective experience for the evolutionary life process itself.
It seemed therefore that we were involved with an <i>evolution of
the function</i> of psychedelic experience. If at first the
symbiosis had made possible the great experiment, its role was
now to help confirm the inevitable showdown implicit in such an
experiment: given the awakening of mankind from the slumber of
animal existence, an awakening in which man acquires the creative
ability, the sense of right and wrong, and all the other God-like
attributes, it is inevitable that such a gift will be repudiated,
and man assume for whatever reason that he is self-made, not born
of the primitive elements of the earth nor of his animal
ancestors, a pretense of omnipotence. The result of this great
experiment would thus usher in an age in which humankind in its
entirety would finally live up to its potential, or perish. If
psychedelic ignorance had in the past contributed to the demise
of localized civilizations, this time the fate of the entire
planet, and all life thereupon, was at stake. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although the energies which I set in motion in this
project I know have reached a great many people, and provided a
catalyst to the more positive of these possibilities, the
scenarios within which I have had to operate never seemed to take
on a continuing spirit of the cooperativeness and enlightened
action that might be expected from a knowledge of the intent of
such a project. The chocolate-covered placebo fiasco was neither
the first nor last of the scenes filled with trivial disputes,
cross-purposes, deceptions and dishonesty, scenes certain to
detract from the business of effective shamanism. Business was,
of course, one of the problems. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ideally, the enlightening medicine should be free;
to attach an earthly value to a sacrament can only devalue the
meaning of the situation in which it is given. But we
co-conspirators could neither afford to work &quot;for free&quot;
in our society of institutionalized greed euphemistically called
competition, nor could we expect others to do so. And the
prohibitionary restrictions of the late 1960's ensured that
people who wished to spread the knowledge of psychedelic wisdom
would often have to deal with unscrupulous intermediaries who
would as soon deal cocaine or other contraband. Cash flow was the
sacred element for such as these. And paradoxically, the
prospective psychedelic initiate also required that a price be
paid for the potion, so paradigmatic was the principle of all
things having their price in this &quot;capitalistic&quot;
society. The power of shamanism in this mundane world had become
in one way like that of the psychiatrist, the effectiveness of
his treatment having been shown by statistical analysis to be
proportional to the size of his fee! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In attempting a modern shamanism I was also at a
great disadvantage not having the direct contact with tribal
members which had always been an essential feature of the
shamanic art in former societies. Rather than direct guidance,
the instructions that went with the potion had to traverse the
several hand-to-hand transactions between myself and the final
recipient. I also had to assume that public information such as
that in the published works of Huxley, Watts, and the many other
gurus of our time would be studied and employed. In the modern
situation, it was also obvious that there could be no public
pronouncement of the intent of such a project in guiding
societies to a new and ecological direction, although many
authors had suggested as much, at least obliquely. Personally, it
would have been absurd to proclaim that this was <i>my</i>
intention, not least for the danger of intervention by the
enforcers of the unenforceable. Today, having years ago retired
from any active continuation of my former activities, it has
become possible to publish an analysis of the intentions and
particulars of that handful of persons, the modern-day shamans
who were instrumental to the early years of the psychedelic
movement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is not hard to understand why, with these
retrospective views now available, that of the various scenes and
collaborations of partners involved in the project, the smaller
and more improvisational efforts were the more successful. The
same seemed to be true of other groups doing similar projects.
Bigness was a certain harbinger of disaster. When big plans were
made, large quantities of psychedelics produced, and sizable sums
changed hands, scenes collapsed, friends became enemies, or at
least no longer friends, and those who, like myself, seemed to
have an inner vision of the overall purpose of the project
encountered the most unlikely coincidences which set in motion
the beginnings of a new collaboration to attempt again that which
had just failed. Many times the coincidences which arrived, in
the course of my own shamanic journey, were so unusual and
unbelievable that I just ignored them; it would have been
pointless to speculate as to the origin or cause of such unlikely
events. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The overall lesson that was illustrated by my
experiences with several groups of collaborators was that a
modern technological and scientific approach to shamanism,
although rewarding for individuals and small groups able to exist
on the periphery of modern &quot;bigness&quot;, was not going to
restore the equilibrium between man and nature within the
confines of the present social reality of Western Civilization.
The modern and artificial distinction of man being apart from
nature seemed to be a direct result of psychedelic ignorance, and
the &quot;bigness&quot; of the modern system of life exaggerated
the distinction so much so that the ecology of the life of early
psychedelic man simply could not be re-created within our modern
system. Hence every attempt to produce sizable quantities of
psychedelics inevitably met a swift retribution; and each time
there occurred a new wave of popularity of psychedelic use which
attracted public attention, that use seemed to degenerate quickly
into misuse, and the majority of those seekers lose sight of the
spirit of their original awakening, just as had entire
civilizations before them. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The tribal nature of the societies of early man had
provided the ideal milieu for beneficial psychedelic use, and the
nature of our own society now prevented its own conversion to a
more ecological, satisfying, and psychedelically-educated way of
life. The only project that made sense therefore, was to attempt
to influence only small groups of people, individuals who would
themselves integrate their psychedelic experience by blending in
discreetly with our modern insanity to influence again only a
small circle of friends, keeping a spark alive and teaching
valuable activities that would be necessary for a future in which
the inevitable if slow collapse of modern civilization into chaos
would eventually restore regional and small, &quot;tribal&quot;
societies to their former importance. Whether that future was to
be a time of great pain and destruction, or relatively benign,
no-one could hope to predict. Certainly, psychedelic education
would help to promote a beneficial transition and prepare those
so educated for the inevitable changes that lay ahead. The
psychedelically-educated would hopefully be able to provide the
wisdom necessary to guide others through a transition that will
certainly be difficult, yet perhaps not cataclysmic if the goal
of modern shamanism were to be adequately realized in time.</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It has long been the accepted wisdom among most
scientists, as well as the common mythology of public perception,
that the rise of tool-making, i.e., <i>technology,</i> was an
important, if not defining characteristic of the evolutionary
process connecting advanced apes to Early Man. Specifically, it
has long been hypothesized that Darwinian selection for
increasingly intelligent hominids came about through selection
for the best abilities to make and use tools. In the extreme, at
least before recent studies of tool use and especially tool-<i>making</i>
in some animal species, the technology of tools was thought to be
a primary defining characteristic separating <i>Homo sapiens</i>
from the animal kingdom. Also among extremities of interpretation
has been the idea that tool-making and early technology might
even have been the force driving the extraordinarily rapid
increase in the size of the primate brain, from the first
hominids of two or three million years ago with a brain volume of
about 400 cubic centimeters, to modern man with a brain volume
more than three times this figure. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is understandably important to science to
explain this evolution in brain size, for it has often been noted
that, on an evolutionary timescale, the rapidity of the change
was practically unprecedented. Since the middle Pleistocene,
about a half-million years ago, the rate of increase was
particularly rapid, so much so that it has even been suggested
that the enlargement might actually have been somewhat
pathological, leading to a being whose irrationality and
capability for wanton destructiveness equals or excels his
creativity. Certainly, the history of the Twentieth Century has
been a pinnacle of both tendencies, and also requires an
explanation, and a resulting solution, if we wish to ensure our
future survival. But even though we may have vestigial organs
such as the appendix, and &quot;skeuomorphic instincts&quot; as I
have discussed, blaming our present situation on purported faults
of evolution is neither productive nor scientifically logical.
The mere proposal of a hypothesis that we have too much brain
power for our own good goes a long way to suggest that we must
therefore have the brain power to correct any such tendency to
let foolishness dominate our lives; scapegoating is seldom a
productive hypothesis. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It now appears that the tool-making hypotheses also
have resulted less from a careful analysis of the data than from
superficial concurrence of two tendencies. We have complex
technology, we have large brains, animals have neither. Seeing
that there are facilitations and parallels between technology and
brain power does not, however, provide more than circumstantial
evidence for causation. And recent work now makes it extremely
likely that the ability to produce technology, it has been called
<i>object-intelligence</i> for want of a better term, has been a
development that has &quot;piggy-backed&quot; upon a much more
important development in intelligence, that which is required for
<i>social transaction.</i> A recent collection of the important
papers providing the foundation for the theory of <i>Machiavellian
Intelligence</i> has been published as a book <a name="back2"></a><a
href="#footnote2">(2)</a>, and I will not present an extensive
argument here for its well-founded conclusions. One quotation
should suffice to illustrate that even anthropologists such as
Thomas Wynn, who might be surmised to have a &quot;vested
interest&quot; in the importance of tool-use and making in the
development of early hominids, has whole-heartedly agreed with
the new view: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Given the evidence of brain evolution and the
    archaeological evidence of technological evolution, I think
    it fair to eliminate from consideration the simple scenario
    in which ability to make better and better tools selected for
    human intelligence. At almost no point in hominid evolution
    was there even a provocative correlation. The earliest known
    hominids, <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i>, had a brain
    larger than an ape's of equivalent size, but as far as we
    know, no greater reliance on tools. Early <i>Homo</i> at 2 Ma
    [million years ago] had a much more 'encephalized' brain, but
    the tools and even the context of use were not beyond the
    capacity of modern apes. <i>Homo erectus</i> did possess
    technology that was outside the range of ape behaviour, but
    by this time, 1.5 Ma, much of the encephalization of the <i>Homo</i>
    line had already occurred. In sum, most of the evolution of
    the human brain, the presumed anatomy of intelligence, had
    occurred prior to any evidence for technological
    sophistication and, as a consequence, it appears unlikely
    that technology itself played a central role in the evolution
    of this impressive human ability. <a name="back3"></a><a
    href="#footnote3">(3)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As one of the contributors to the book remarked,
Wynn's paper &quot;is a bombshell to the older 'Tools makyth Man'
view... Wynn throws the question of the cause of human brain size
back into the realm of the invisible: either the social
relationships or the lifestyle which produced technology, not the
technology itself.&quot; <a name="back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">(4)</a>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The conclusions of the <i>Machiavellian
Intelligence</i> hypothesis fit well with my own theory, and lead
to the most probable evolutionary scenario for the influence of
psychedelic plants in the emergence of modern humans. The
arguments of the hypothesis show that the complexity of logical
operations required for social interaction in large groups of
individuals is far greater than that required for tool use or
making, or for that matter any other activity of primate species.
<a name="back5"></a><a href="#footnote5">(5)</a> Studies of
societies of monkeys and apes in both natural and controlled
environments strongly support the theoretical arguments. The
brain size of various species of modern primates, for example,
has been closely correlated with the size and complexity of the
social groups of the various species studied. The complexity of
social interaction would increase geometrically with the number
of possible interrelations between animals in a group consisting
of three or more generations of relatively long-lived animals.
Complex dominance relationships, alliances, group undertakings
such as efficient foraging and hunting, lengthy childhood, and
relatively constant possibility of mating activity add to the
complexity. The demands of increasing social complexity was a
development requiring far faster biological evolution of the
equipment which facilitated it than any previous set of demands
such as tool use and manufacture, climate change, interactions
with other species, or other hypothesized evolutionary pressures.
Thus it is reasonable that the rapid increase in brain size among
primates requires no other explanation, despite its unprecedented
speed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The proposal of early influence of psychedelic
plants on hominid evolution as a factor in brain enlargement
(between one and five million years ago), as suggested by Terence
McKenna, is therefore difficult to support. Criticism of
McKenna's theory as presented in his <i>Food of the Gods</i> has
been sometimes dismissive, <a name="back6"></a><a
href="#footnote6">(6)</a> and although I find much of value in
the book, I would have to agree that his proposals that
psychedelics were &quot;mutation-causing&quot; agents that
&quot;directly influenced the rapid reorganization of the brain's
information-processing capacities&quot; are unsupported by
evidence, and unnecessary in light of the much more reasonable <i>Machiavellian
Intelligence</i> hypothesis. The temptation to explain the rapid
evolution of the primate brain has led more than one author to
error, however. What McKenna overlooked was a much more recent
period of prehistory in which a proposed psychedelic influence
fits a wide range of facts like a glove. In the preceding
chapters I have outlined many of these facts, and it remains now
to show at what period an intervention of psychedelic influence
is most likely in consideration of several areas of knowledge
about fossils, human genetics, climate changes and catastrophic
events, and other sources of information. The necessity for
psychedelic intervention has already been established in previous
chapters, the question of when such intervention occurred is the
present concern. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before presenting possible evolutionary scenarios
however, let me explore further the idea of social complexity and
its relation to the habit routine model of cognitive operation I
have proposed earlier. I stated that the power of the habit
routine cognitive system would have increased with the increasing
complexity of animal species, and would have reached its summit
in proto-man. The <i>Machiavellian Intelligence</i> hypothesis
and its proposed increasing social complexity fits perfectly with
my surmise. Increased social complexity and the evolution of a
large, expensive to support nervous system go hand in hand with
extreme reliance on habit routine generation as the primary
cognitive mechanism. One major consideration is that a large
brain requires an excellent and copious diet, a requirement that
would be fulfilled best in a social group able to cooperate on
the highest levels to procure and share a wide variety of
nutritious foods. An ability to avoid toxic plants as well would
depend on complex social relationships as I will show in a
moment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It might be said that all these requirements would
be an argument <i>against</i> the use of psychedelic agents in
such social groups, an argument with which I entirely agree! The
increasing social complexity and food requirements are arguments
for the increasing power of sophiolytic tendencies and habits
that would prevent any cognitive breakthrough to using the new
brain for purposes other than the maintenance of social order and
survival, a significant strengthening of the habit routine
system. Experimentation with new foods, such as psychedelic
plants, would not in normal circumstances have been a common, or
even likely occurrence. Two quotations concerning the diet and
food sources for primates will illustrate the point, the first
quotation concerning the necessity for a rich and complex diet,
the second on the ways this is fulfilled while yet preventing
exposure to toxic (or presumably psychedelic) items: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Monkeys and apes have to balance their diet, which they do
    by wide ranging and yet selective eating; this is nicely
    illustrated by a study of Sri Lankan monkeys, <i>Macaca
    sinica</i>, by Marcel Hladik. By careful observation and
    quantification of their feeding, and phytochemical analysis
    of their food plants, he was able to show that for these
    'frugivorous' monkeys, fruit was always more abundant than
    they could ever need. However, the monkeys had large day
    ranges and occupied a home range too large for efficient
    defense as a territory. Why? Their ranging was apparently a
    consequence of a need to eat fungi, rotten wood, insects,
    bark, shoots-a whole range of items that allowed them to make
    up the protein, vitamin, and mineral deficiencies of the
    energy-rich ripe fruit (Hladik 1975). The need for a balanced
    diet forces many primates to eat items that are hard to find.
    In studying baboon ecology, I was continually amazed at the
    subtle cues that they must use to identify some of their
    plant foods; at the most harsh time of year, the main
    survival foods were all either underground, or tiny and
    inconspicuous. <a name="back7"></a><a href="#footnote7">(7)</a>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Mother primates of several species pull their infants away
    from novel objects (two species of macaque), or remove foods
    from infants if the food is not part of the diet
    (chimpanzee). Caro and Hauser suggest that the latter might
    be 'accidental', but having seen it happen in gorillas, I
    doubt this (Anne Russon, who has noted the same in
    orang-utans, shares my scepticism). An infant gorilla was
    fiddling with and chewing at a leaf (of a species not
    normally eaten), facing away from the mother who was eating
    herself, when the mother broke off her feeding, reached over
    the infant's head and took the leaf, dropping it well out of
    the infant's reach. In the case of a chimpanzee watched by
    Mariko Hiraiwa-Hasegawa (1986), the mother not only did the
    same, but systematically picked every other leaf of the same
    species in the infant's reach and placed her foot firmly on
    the pile of leaves! But in any of these cases, the function
    is unclear: does the behaviour serve to teach, or simply to
    remove infants from danger? <a name="back8"></a><a
    href="#footnote8">(8)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It has been proposed <a href="#footnote9">(9)</a> <a
name="back9"></a>that the dietary requirements of animals with
complex nervous systems was itself a factor in the evolution of
hominid intelligence, the increasing need for a high-quality diet
selecting for advances in intelligence and larger brains, which
itself would demand further dietary improvements. This must
certainly be the case, but I think that the methods used by
advancing species to procure better and better diets are
themselves aspects of social behavior, and thus fall under the
hypotheses of <i>Machiavellian Intelligence.</i> It was only
through the advancing complexity of social life that the dietary
requirements could be met, either for the actual procurement and
sharing of foodstuffs or for the transmission of the knowledge of
how to obtain them, and how to avoid serious errors such as
ingesting toxic items. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As I have just suggested, if increased social
complexity and the need for a correspondingly complex diet to
satisfy the needs of a large brain indicate anything, they would
seem to argue <i>against </i>much use of psychedelic plants in
advanced apes and proto-man. Indeed, an individual who
accidentally ingested a plant which disrupted his function and
place in such a social system would most likely lose that place,
and possibly be ostracized and excluded from the group. This is
the substance of Andrew Weil's comments on McKenna's hypothesis
(footnote 6). Psychedelic influence on <i>H. erectus</i> and even
more remote human predecessors is of course possible, as
McKenna's model suggests, but I believe it was unlikely, and if
so, unimportant to either social or neurological evolution.
Certainly, evidence is very sparse indeed, and there are
important counter-arguments to be considered: For example, <i>H.
erectus </i>lived on 3 continents in various habitats and through
several periods of disruptive climatic change for a period of 1
or 2 million years, yet remained in a relatively unchanging
state, with few signs of significant cultural or technological
innovation. This is certainly a sign of normal, slow evolution,
not psychedelic evolution. By contrast, the culture of early
Greece, with psychedelic influence, advanced dramatically from a
quite primitive state to an advanced civilization in the space of
a thousand years or so. In addition, the progression from <i>Australopithecus</i>
to <i>erectus</i> to <i>sapiens</i> involved many different
anatomical developments, not only brain size and reorganizations,
but speech-enabling changes to the larynx, <a name="back10"></a><a
href="#footnote10">(10)</a> even an enlargement of nerve canals
in the spine suggested as facilitating the precise diaphragm
control needed for speech, <a name="back11"></a><a
href="#footnote11">(11)</a> and many other anatomical changes.
This is certainly an argument for slow gradual evolution, not
psychedelically-enabled or &quot;psychedelic-mutagenic&quot;
evolution as suggested by McKenna. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From the preceding arguments concerning social
stability, we may thus surmise that the influence of psychedelics
on our immediate ancestors must have also involved some other
simultaneous and important changes or events which helped to
suppress the described tendencies to greater and greater
dependence on habit routine and the sophiolytic mode. Some
unusual change must have occurred to allow and ensure that
psychedelic use would occur on a significant scale and would
rapidly and irreversibly transform the habits of the hominid
group that was the precursor of modern humans. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is necessary to point out, however, that the
very brain changes which facilitated social evolution and a
powerful habit routine cognitive system would be the same changes
that would make an eventual psychedelic intervention most
effective: A greatly expanded cortex to allow the storage of
long-lasting and complex memory data used for habit routine
search, would also implement creativity that was far more than
random trial and error, creativity that could intentionally
produce wide-ranging positive results: we would not expect
attempts at creativity by a small-brained animal to result in
much more than increased risk for that animal. A greatly expanded
portion of the cortex involved with &quot;association
processing&quot; allowing the assembly of habit routines of a
multisensory and intentional complexity, would also facilitate
highly effective creativity. And a greatly expanded frontal
cortex, the seat of working memory and other advanced cognitive
abilities, facilitating habit routine based upon simultaneous
nested levels of intentionality, would likewise be instrumental
to a being requiring the frequent use of improvisation in
situations which involved simultaneous trains of logical
operations. The same nervous system improvements that enable
advanced habit routine generation and use also provide for
psychedelically-enlightened operation that is productive and
creative, and not just hazardous to an animal. Here we have an
additional argument against the influence of psychedelic agents
at an early, small-brained stage of hominid evolution:
psychedelics would not have &quot;worked&quot; on animals with
limited brain capabilities. We might say that psychedelics
haven't really &quot;worked&quot; on humans either, considering
our backsliding tendencies to ignore (and eradicate) psychedelic
tribal wisdom that has accumulated for millennia. The present
state of Western Civilization in this &quot;century of
holocaust&quot; is a direct result of that ignorance, and if it
should lead to the scenarios of devastation and collapse which
have all too often been predicted by some, we will have to
conclude that the great experiment, the psychedelic intervention,
will indeed have been a failure. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One further argument will suffice to eliminate from
consideration an early psychedelic influence on hominid
evolution. The role of language in hominid development has been
another hotly-debated topic of late. It is my contention that the
psychedelic state of consciousness would have been of little or
no value for an individual, and would have provided no
evolutionary breakthrough for a social group which did not
already have the benefit of complex language abilities.
Psychedelic use and its effects are most valuable as a cumulative
phenomenon. The psychedelic experience must not only be
individually integrated but socially integrated as well, if it is
to provide a key to rapid cultural advance. There must arise a
&quot;psychedelic culture&quot; which is transmitted and
developed from one generation to the next, and through which the
beginnings of shamanism can arise. Without symbolic language, it
is difficult to see how such a process might happen. Once a
fairly complex language ability had evolved, however, we may
imagine that psychedelic experience would have provided an
impetus for further important language development into abilities
concerned with the expression of the abstract, the mythical, the
artistic, language capable of elaborating and transmitting <i>tradition,</i>
the hallmark of culture. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whereas written language is a cultural phenomenon
which must be taught, (a child who is not taught to read and
write will certainly not pick up the ability spontaneously),
spoken language <i>is</i> assimilated spontaneously. Spoken
language is a <i>biologically-inherent</i> feature of the human
brain, a realization that became apparent to the linguist Noam
Chomsky several decades ago. Steven Pinker, a former student of
Chomsky, has made several conclusions concerning language and its
evolution which are pertinent to a hypothesis of the time period
in which psychedelic influence might have played a role in human
evolution. <a name="back12"></a><a href="#footnote12">(12)</a> On
the strength of much recent research, Pinker concludes that the
first anatomically modern humans <i>already</i> spoke the
equivalent of modern human language. Since language is intrinsic
to the brain structures which produce and interpret it, language
must have co-evolved with those structures, and have been fully
realized with the advent of the brain with which it co-evolved.
Spoken language was therefore not &quot;invented&quot; at a late
stage of that evolution, (although reading and writing most
certainly were). Since language is inherently a social
phenomenon, this proposed co-evolution of brain and language fits
nicely with the <i>Machiavellian Intelligence</i> hypothesis of
brain advances being driven by social requirements, including the
advancement of language capability. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pinker notes therefore that &quot;language did not
first appear in the Upper Paleolithic beginning about 30,000
years ago, contrary to claims frequently seen in
archaeological...and popular science treatments.&quot; <a
name="back13"></a><a href="#footnote13">(13)</a> The idea that
psychedelics would not have &quot;worked&quot; on our
small-brained forbears such as <i>Australopithecus</i> is
supported by the proposed necessity of the existence of complex
language as a precursor for the beneficial influence of
psychedelics, and considerably narrows the time frame in which
such influence must have played its role. Using conclusions from
linguistics and brain evolution, we see that such a time frame
should extend from about 150Ka to 50Ka (thousand years ago). I
shall further narrow this window of opportunity for psychedelic
influence in my arguments to follow. The important conclusion
which has just been developed is that psychedelic plants in the
environment cannot have played any significant role in either the
early development of language, nor in the parallel development
and tripling in size of the hominid brain during the period from
about 3Ma to the appearance of anatomically modern humans about
150Ka. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Considering the importance of language in
evolution, and the importance of language for various modern
arguments as to how the process of man's evolution took place,
some further comments are appropriate which will tie together
some ideas expressed in previous chapters with the task at hand.
It is widely hypothesized, quite correctly I believe, that major
enhancements to spoken language occurred during the Upper
Paleolithic with the appearance of anatomically modern hominids.
As Pinker has noted, certain observers thus wish to believe that
language itself was practically non-existent before this period.
The argument of language being inherent to the brain structures
which produce it, and therefore of the necessity that language
co-evolved with those brain structures is a powerful rebuttal of
such ideas, but additional evidence also favors the co-evolution
claim. As noted in the last chapter, rudimentary language
abilities have now been definitively shown to exist in our
closest relative, the chimpanzee. It was also noted that language
abilities are not used by chimpanzees in the wild, but the fact
that these primitive language capabilities exist at all must
indicate that rudimentary brain circuitry for producing language
nevertheless exists. If such circuitry was present, albeit in
very primitive form, at the period of divergence between the <i>Panidae</i>
and early hominids, it is unreasonable to assume that such
circuitry might continue to evolve for the next several million
years, to be used suddenly at the Upper Paleolithic to produce
complex language which had no precedent whatsoever. The only
argument here could be that these brain areas which later
permitted spoken language were all along used for another
function altogether. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although I feel that chimpanzee language ability,
and certainly the arguments of Pinker and other linguists,
strongly favor the continuous existence and development of
language throughout hominid development, the alternative use
argument just cited brings us to another consideration which is
important to my theory. Referring back to figure 1 in chapter 3
and the associated text, it will be seen that according to my
cognitive hypothesis, language is but one, if the most obvious
and important, of the <i>symbolizing</i> functions of the
thinking1-thinking2 conglomerate. In other words, language, the
serial realization of thinking in abstract symbolic form, is not
itself the <i>material</i> or <i>medium</i> of the thought
process until a late stage, and is not necessarily a part of the
thinking process at all. My model is, of course, in contention
with the majority of recently proposed cognitive models of the
function and construction of language, and I do not expect its
easy acceptance: only the evidence of the many-sided picture that
my theory of psychedelic experience presents might have the power
to convince scientists today that the cognitive model of
thinking1-thinking2 processes might have some general
applicability. The neurologist Harry Jerison, for example,
proposes that language itself is the medium of reflective thought
and imagery: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The role of language in communication first evolved
    as a side effect in the construction of reality,&quot;
    proposes Harry Jerison, a neurologist at the University of
    California, Los Angeles, who has made a special study of
    brain evolution. &quot;We can think of language as being
    merely an expression of another neural contribution to the
    construction of mental imagery.&quot; Brains throughout
    evolutionary history have been shaped to construct an inner
    world appropriate to a species' daily life. In amphibians,
    vision provides the principal element of that world; for
    reptiles, an acute sense of smell. For the earliest mammals,
    hearing was additionally important; and in primates, a
    melange of sensory input creates a complete mental model of
    external reality. Humans, says Jerison, have added a further
    component: language, or more precisely, reflective thought
    and imagery. Thus equipped, the human mind creates an
    internal model of the world that is uniquely capable of
    representing and coping with complex practical and social
    challenges. Inner reflection, not outer communication, was
    the facility upon which natural selection worked, argues
    Jerison. Language was its medium-and, at the same time, an
    efficient tool for communication. This hypothesis now has
    wide support. <a name="back14"></a><a href="#footnote14">(14)</a>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Too bad. I believe the hypothesis that language is
the <i>medium</i> of the construction of mental models of
reality, is misguided. But it wouldn't be the first instance in
the history of science where the experts were wrong. Firstly, as
stated here, the model implies that without language, the
construction of mental models of the world, by animals for
instance, is minimal. Yet the habit routine cognitive model shows
that the habit routine, constructed by thinking1 processes and
analyzed by thinking2 processes, <i>is</i> the mental model of
reality we are concerned with, and that the transformation into
language or other forms of symbolization is a subsidiary,
secondary, and non-essential process occurring in thinking2. As I
have argued previously, the habit routine system has been the
constant companion of animal life from the beginning, it is the
primary function of <i>all</i> animal nervous systems, not just
advanced ones such as our own. It is interesting how close the
above quotation comes to the idea of the habit routine model as
the mechanism of construction of the &quot;mental model of
external reality,&quot; (&quot;a melange of sensory input creates
a complete mental model of external reality&quot;) but then
misses the necessary conclusion. Jerison's model would have the
symbolization function as the primary cognitive operation, but
that would require that the &quot;raw material&quot; of
symbolization be the primary sensory information rather than the
generated habit routine, and a great deal of evidence, summarized
in previous chapters, argues against this model. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Language is not at all the <i>medium</i> of the
thinking processes which precedes symbolization, which is a
resonance to the habit routine and its analysis. Language as it
is realized, or other forms of symbolization such as the
production of gesture or music, perhaps also the expression of
emotion via facial expression and general posture, are <i>serial</i>
processes, yet the habit routine, the internal model of the
world, is <i>iconic.</i> It is a Gestalt, a constantly changing
and updated <i>holistic</i> entity not requiring elaboration
through a serial process of point for point representation with
abstract symbols as does language. Our basic thinking process is
in terms of icons or Gestalts, <i>holoprojections</i>, which
later, and sometimes very laboriously, may find only incomplete
and unsatisfactory expression through the symbolization
processes. Consider this statement by Albert Einstein, describing
the way he considered his creative thinking to occur: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The words of the language, as they are written or
    spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of
    thought. The psychical entities in my case are . . . visual
    and some of muscular type. Conventional words and other signs
    have to be sought for laboriously only in a secondary
    stage.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus many recent views of language and thinking
miss the essential fact that the great part of what constitutes
thinking, both conscious and pre-conscious as with the
construction of the habit routine, has nothing to do with the
serial process of spoken language at all. The creation of the
mental model of reality is not &quot;linguistic&quot; except in
the sense that we might define a new type of &quot;language&quot;
constituted not of words and the rules for serially connecting
them, but of the very iconic Gestalts that are created by habit
routine search. The evolution of the ability to produce the habit
routine Gestalt started probably with the very first animals, as
I have discussed, but the evolution of spoken language only began
much later. The two evolutionary processes are very far apart
indeed, as are the brain processes which produce them. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The problem of the modern understanding of these
facts probably arises from the nature of the methods of modern
Western science itself. It is, above all, a <i>descriptive</i>
undertaking, and therefore a <i>serial</i> process rather than an
<i>experiential, iconic</i> one. So in attempting to
&quot;scientifically explain&quot; many of our cognitive
abilities using descriptive <i>language</i>, we must necessarily
let serial symbolization rule our paradigm to such an extent that
we ignore certain aspects of the ongoing iconic thinking process
which is the seed of our explanations. Thus the possible Gestalts
which would themselves, if we became aware of them, allow us an
experience of the nature of the iconic thinking processes which
precede symbolization, of how they provide the basis for
symbolization, are ignored by the requirements of our paradigm to
provide only serial explanation: these ignored Gestalts, the
iconic habit routines which would give a view of the nearly
invisible underlying thinking processes, <i>do not activate the
significance detection system piloted by the locus coeruleus,
because we have ruled them out from consideration by the
programming of working memory with the specifics of our paradigm,
this is the conscious feedback process which is an input, along
with sensory information, to the habit routine generation process
in thinking1</i> (see again figure 1)<i>.</i> Except in the
reflection of those unusually perceptive and gifted individuals
such as Einstein who have developed life-long habits of looking
for the significant in what everyone else deems the routine, the
iconic nature of basic thinking processes is therefore rendered
invisible. As I have shown, of course, the psychedelic experience
can produce this very same result reliably and safely, although
it requires considerable experience with the drugs to understand
that this is what is happening, and to use the effect to its
potential. I might say, perhaps not too ponderously I hope, that
this entire book is the symbolization in language of an iconic
entity or Gestalt, a &quot;mental model&quot; of my theory that I
have been slowly constructing over the years. I &quot;know&quot;
full well its entire content and form, and yes, it seems to be
visual and even &quot;muscular&quot; in a certain sense, but its
translation into serial language is another affair altogether,
requiring entirely different types of effort than the
construction of the informational entity which I am describing.
Interestingly, the symbolization in language does have a feedback
to the characteristics of the iconic Gestalt: the fine points of
its significance, the small details of the interrelations of its
parts seem to be refined as the experimental process of
symbolization attempts to capture its essence in words.</p>

<p></p>

<hr width="50%">

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Other parts of my theory, such as the
neuromechanics of HRS, the cognitive operations mapped in figure
1, and other &quot;pieces of the puzzle,&quot; are models, useful
aids, heuristic devices useful until better models come along, a
development which must surely come to pass considering the
speculative methods which led to their proposal. But the
suggestion of an evolutionary scenario for human development
attempts to establish an actual series of events in history, if
pre-history. Considering the very fragmentary evidence in the
fossil record, and the indirect nature of other modern evidence
to be described below, the chance for error in proposing the
story of how Early Man made his way out of Eden is humbling. As
we have seen above, the first theory of psychedelic evolution,
that of McKenna, has suffered, perhaps terminally, from a dose of
counterargument all too easily supplied by the critics. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Much of McKenna's book remains admirable however,
for instance his presentation of evidence indicating the probable
importance of psychedelic plants for the very early tribal
societies which lived on the Tassili Plateau of southern Algeria,
or atal Hyk in central Anatolia. These are examples, along
with ancient Greece and the Eleusinian Mysteries, which
illustrate the rapid flowering of culture possible in societies
in which there is strong, if not incontrovertible evidence of
psychedelic use. The importance of psychedelics for early man
certainly suggests an important evolutionary influence as well:
the trick is to deduce, using a wide variety of ancient and
modern evidence, when and where, and why that evolutionary
influence might have taken place. Let me start by considering
some modern reinterpretations of the fossil evidence which have
recently received overwhelming support from one of science's most
recent and fascinating developments, molecular genetics. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Chris Stringer, who is today the head of the Human
Origins Group of the Natural History Museum in London, recounts a
most interesting tale of scientific discovery in his recent book,
<i>African Exodus</i>, co-authored by the science writer Robin
McKie. It is the kind of story which has epitomized the romance
and excitement of scientific discovery and revolution as
perceived by the lay public, stories such as the Curies'
discovery of radium or Galileo's road to revolutionary views of
the heavens. The important periods of these scientists' work
were, of course, marked far more by hard work than by romance!
But not only is the story of these recent discoveries concerning
human origins of interest to the general public, it represents a
scientific revolution of important scope, comparable to the
recent revolution in geology with the advent of the discovery of
plate tectonics, or even the revolution in physics earlier in the
century. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first chapters of <i>African Exodus</i> are
concerned with a close examination of the &quot;bones and
stones,&quot; in which Dr. Stringer shows how the Multiregional
Hypothesis <a name="back15"></a><a href="#footnote15">(15)</a> of
human evolution, the predominant model for most of this century,
has just recently been discredited in favor of an Out-of-Africa
(actually an Out-of-Africa II) <a name="back16"></a><a
href="#footnote16">(16)</a> model. A new mathematical technique,
multivariate analysis, used by Dr. Stringer during his several
years of work on the fossils, led him to doubt the validity of
the multiregional theory early on in his career. But only a small
minority of paleoanthropologists were ready to listen to new
analyses of fossil characteristics which called into question the
status quo of their profession, for many great scientists of the
past decades had analyzed these same fossils and there was wide
consensus that a multiregional scenario was the correct one. The
upheavals and conflicts typical of a newly-born scientific
revolution ensued. A revolutionary new idea proposed by a small
group of scientists, at first rejected as absurd by the
establishment, soon began to topple that establishment. Chris
Stringer and Robin McKie introduce the book: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>For the past few years, a small group of scientists has
    been accumulating evidence that has revolutionised our
    awareness of ourselves, and our animal origins. They have
    shown that we belong to a young species, which rose like a
    phoenix from a crisis which threatened its very survival, and
    then conquered the world in a few millennia. The story is an
    intriguing and mysterious one, and it challenges many basic
    assumptions we have about ourselves... It is a remarkable,
    and highly controversial narrative that has generated
    headlines round the world and which has been the subject of a
    sustained programme of vilification by scientists who have
    spent their lives committed to the opposing view that we have
    an ancient, million-year-old ancestry. The debate, which
    reverberates in museums, universities and learned
    institutions across the world, is one of the most bitter in
    the history of science. <a name="back17"></a><a
    href="#footnote17">(17)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What finally broke the dam of resistance to the new
ideas was the entry upon the scene of revolutionary new
techniques from a field which had previously played no role
whatever in paleoanthropology, molecular genetics. Until very
recently, the possibility that we might learn something about the
evolution of our distant ancestors by studying the genetic makeup
of living humans was hardly even suspected, and of course the
techniques for doing so completely unknown. But all this changed
rapidly as the science of molecular genetics grew from its
infancy in the 1960's to the powerful tool it is today. The use
of genetic analysis for understanding evolution, the science of <i>molecular
anthropology,</i> also had its beginning the 1960's, with the
pioneering work of Allan Wilson (later to be a key player in the
confirmation of the Out-of-Africa scenario) and Vincent Sarich.
It was their early work that began to topple many sacred cows of
paleoanthropology, the first to fall being the idea that apes and
humans had diverged very early, between fifteen and thirty Ma. By
comparing protein structures of modern apes and man, Wilson and
Sarich concluded that the separation could have been no earlier
than 5Ma. &quot;We were variously ignored, abused and
scorned,&quot; recalls Sarich. But it was the first of many
venerable precepts of paleoanthropology that was to fall to the
new techniques of genetic analysis. The research of Wilson and
the many others who followed came along at precisely the right
time to resoundingly confirm the early work of Stringer. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Stringer and McKie mention in their introduction
above that our species &quot;rose like a phoenix from a crisis
which threatened its very survival,&quot; and propose later on in
the book the occurrence of a population bottleneck sometime about
100 to 150Ka. The possibility of such a bottleneck has also drawn
criticism from defenders of the orthodoxy, yet again the genetic
evidence is what has come to the forefront to support the
proposal. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The genetic evidence in question was not at first
concerned with the DNA of the cell nuclei, found in every cell of
the body and which is responsible for control of the growing
embryo and inheritance of physical traits, but DNA contained the <i>mitochondria</i>
of these same cells. These small structures within animal cells
act like metabolic power-packs, enabling the biochemical
reactions which provide the cell with energy. That these
structures contain their own DNA, entirely different from nuclear
DNA, is something of a curiosity, and has led to speculation that
very early on in evolution, mitochondria might have been a
separate organism which developed a symbiotic relationship with
primitive single-celled life forms to enable the evolution of the
first true single-celled animals. Whatever their evolutionary
story, the mitochondria and their independently organized DNA
strands have provided an important key for the understanding of
hominid evolution. Two specific characteristics of mtDNA
(mitochondrial DNA) figure importantly: firstly, mtDNA is
transmitted only through the female lineage, since the
mitochondria of sperm reside in the cell's extranuclear
protoplasm, and do not enter the egg at fertilization. Thus mtDNA
provides a powerful tool for tracing genealogies in animals, and
reconstructing recent evolutionary trees. Secondly, mtDNA has a
relatively high and constant rate of random mutation which is
conveniently analyzed, thus constituting a &quot;molecular
clock&quot; providing genetic markers for accurately tracing
migration and fissioning in human societies. A recent paper by
Rebecca L. Cann, an early associate of Allan C. Wilson, explains
more fully the peculiarities of mtDNA which result in its being
such a powerful tool for the study of evolution. Concerning the
bottleneck hypothesis resulting from mtDNA studies she recounts: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When I began my study of mtDNA in the late 1970s with Dr.
    Allan C. Wilson, one of his postdoctoral fellows, Dr. Wesley
    Brown, was writing up his work on a study of 21 human mtDNAs.
    Dr. Brown had discovered that using restriction fragment
    length polymorphisms (RFLPs), humans as a species looked
    'different' to other mammals. He found that in comparison to
    two chimpanzees, or two gorillas, or two orang-utans, or two
    gibbons, or even two pocket gophers, humans had only one-half
    to one-fifth of the intraspecific variability seen in our
    closest primate relatives and other genetically
    well-characterized mammals. In 1980, Brown proposed that the
    level of variability sampled in his study was consistent with
    the derivation of the human mitochondrial sequence from a
    single female about 200,000 years ago. This was the origin of
    the bottle-neck hypothesis and mitochondrial 'Eve'. <a
    name="back18"></a><a href="#footnote18">(18)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The mitochondrial &quot;Eve&quot; hypothesis
naturally made big headlines, was featured on the cover of such
magazines as <i>Time </i>and<i> Newsweek,</i> and also quite
naturally was journalistically exaggerated out of all proportion
to the original claims. A concerted attack by the
multiregionalist &quot;old guard&quot; also helped to make the
new idea sound a bit absurd, both to the public, and to
scientists in other fields not yet acquainted with the genetic
evidence. All the criticisms have been adequately countered
however, and the findings confirmed by newer and more complete
studies, including studies on the nuclear DNA. Rebecca Cann was
careful to explain, in the above quoted paper, the intended
interpretation of the hypothesis concerning the possible number
of individuals existing at the time of the proposed bottleneck.
Since mtDNA is passed on only through the female lineage, the
existence of a mitochondrial &quot;Eve&quot; does not imply that
our <i>nuclear DNA</i> is also descended from a single
individual, nor that at one point the human lineage was reduced
to a single, or mere handful of individuals (the &quot;Biblical
Eve&quot; scenario!) Recent estimates of the number of
individuals existing at the time of the bottleneck, including
that of Chris Stringer, puts the number at perhaps ten thousand. <a
name="back19"></a><a href="#footnote19">(19)</a> It may be argued
that a population of ten thousand individuals is not what one
could call a genetic bottleneck, yet the sum of the genetic
evidence indicates that &quot;there were at least 100,000 adult
archaic forebears of our Africa ancestors about 200,000 years
ago.&quot; <a name="back20"></a><a href="#footnote20">(20)</a>
Thus a decrease to 10,000 individuals is certainly a
&quot;population crash&quot; indicative of important events in
the early evolution of modern man. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for the date of the lifetime of
&quot;mitochondrial Eve,&quot; there have been various estimates
between the extremes of about 60 to 400Ka based on several
different methods of mtDNA analysis. Some best estimates put the
life of &quot;mitochondrial Eve&quot; at about 130 to 140Ka,
&quot;the date of origin of modern humans.&quot; <a name="back21"></a><a
href="#footnote21">(21)</a> The uncertainties in these several
estimates may be narrowed by considering data from other fields
of study, and from a view of the overall evolutionary scenario
which emerges upon consideration of all the information at our
disposal, including my own hypotheses of the influence of
psychedelics on the overall process. Using all these sources, a
reasonably constrained sequence of events with fairly accurate
dates becomes possible. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In looking at the combined evidence from new
interpretations of the &quot;stones and bones,&quot; (Chris
Stringer's findings), the genetic evidence, (now far more
convincing than just a few years ago), and other pieces of the
puzzle, Stringer and other workers have come to the conclusion
that there must have been some kind of unusual event, some
catalyst, some kind of &quot;trigger&quot; which set in motion
the very rapid rise of human culture and civilization which began
a mere few moments ago on an evolutionary scale. The strong
evidence for a population bottleneck, during which time
individuals existed who were our sole ancestors, and the ensuing
rapid migration and rapid rise of human culture in every corner
of the earth, has led these workers to ask a central and
important question for which they have not yet formulated an
answer. Stringer and McKie write: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It was one of the critical events in mankind's convoluted
    route to evolutionary success. The nature of the trigger of
    this great social upheaval is still hotly debated, but
    remains a mystery at the heart of our 'progress' as a
    species. Was it a biological, mental or social event that
    sent our species rushing pell-mell towards world domination?
    Was it the advent of symbolic language, the appearance of the
    nuclear family as the basic element of human social
    structure, or a fundamental change in the workings of the
    brain? Whatever the nature of the change, it has a lot to
    answer for. It transformed us from minor bit players in a
    zoological soap opera into evolutionary superstars, with all
    the attendant dangers of vanity, hubris and indifference to
    the fate of others that such an analogy carries with lt. <a
    name="back22"></a><a href="#footnote22">(22)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reading this paragraph in <i>African Exodus,</i> I
realized I had been for several years working on ideas which
constituted the very answer sought by this recent revolution in
thinking about human evolution. It was, as I have said in chapter
2, &quot;Models and Theories,&quot; a falling into place of
pieces of a puzzle which justified so much earlier &quot;wild
speculation,&quot; a realization that practically by accident I
had found a key that many others were actively searching for
which would enable the opening of a door to an important future
in understanding. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rebecca Cann asks, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We often wonder if language played a part of the process,
    and that our ancestors all had some new mutations which
    allowed them to spread, at the expense of the other
    indigenous peoples. [Results of genetic research] suggest the
    spread of our ancestors was rapid, with little mixing. <a
    name="back23"></a><a href="#footnote23">(23)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although language certainly played a part in the
process, as I have already discussed, the identity of the
trigger, the origin of the population bottleneck, the reason
behind man's migration to the ends of the earth, the factor
enabling the rapid rise of culture independently in all these
regions, the factor behind the ability of the new hominids to
out-compete all former races of archaic man, the secret of the
birth of the human race, may all be intimately related to one and
the same phenomenon: the advent of psychedelic use by a
regionally isolated group of proto-humans somewhere in Africa.
Such use might then have spread with the spread of the
descendants of this core group of individuals, mimicking a
population bottleneck in that psychedelic use and the advantages
it provided were closely guarded secrets not evident or available
to competing &quot;tribes.&quot; As I stated previously, if a
member of a competing &quot;tribe&quot; were to use the new
medicine, it would only serve to isolate him from his own group.
Psychedelic use could then have been at once the reason for an
apparent but not necessarily absolute bottleneck, and also the
trigger, the key which enabled this original group to expand and
prosper by virtue of the cognitive advantages provided by the
cumulative effects of psychedelic use. These advantages, I remind
the reader, concern a new and powerful ability to suspend a mode
of existence entirely governed by habit routine. The advanced ape
that was our predecessor necessarily had, as I have shown, the
most complete, one might say irrevocable dependence on habit
routine of any animal yet evolved, a dependence entirely
precluding the use of the most advanced nervous system ever
evolved for creative purposes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what of that other facilitating factor I
mentioned before, the one that would allow psychedelic use to
become important and not just an infrequent and disorienting
event for single individuals who might then expulsed from their
group? Some environmental or social situation must have resulted
in the frequent use of psychedelics by a significant proportion
of the core group, and psychedelic use must then have become part
and parcel of the social structure of the group. There are
several possibilities. Here another body of research information
on climate change becomes important, for during the proposed
period between 100Ka and 200Ka, drastic climatic changes were
occurring on a time scale certain to disrupt all life on the
planet, especially those advanced forms of life so dependent on
social complexity and a diversified diet. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In view of the best estimates for the time slot for
the population bottleneck and mitochondrial Eve (about 133Ka), <a
name="back24"></a><a href="#footnote24">(24)</a> a particular
period of climatic history stands out: the Eemian interglacial
period. During the Eemain, warm, wet, and tropical conditions
extended much further north than at present. The fossil evidence
shows that hippopotamuses browsed along the banks of the Thames
and the Rhine, while lions and elephants roamed the forests of
southern England. Until recently, the Eemian interglacial period
was thought to have been a stable climatic period lasting from
about 130Ka to 114Ka, when the beginning of the last ice age
commenced. Climatic information has been obtained from such
methods as analysis of ocean sediment cores, pollen cores from
terrestrial sources, and ice cores drilled in such locations as
Antarctica and Greenland. A recent ice core analysis from
Greenland however, has given us a radically new view of the
Eemain climatic era, indicating that it was not a period of
stability but rather one of wild climatic oscillations: <a
name="back25"></a><a href="#footnote25">(25)</a> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The early part of the Eemian was dominated by several
    oscillations between warm and cool stages. The temperature
    dropped by as much as 10 degrees, sometimes within as short a
    time as ten to thirty years. Some cold spells lasted a few
    decades, while others lasted several hundred years. After
    8000 years of fluctuating conditions, the climate settled
    into a period of stable warmth lasting some 2000 years. This
    warm period ended abruptly...when the temperature in
    Greenland dropped about 14 C within ten years. <a

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such a period as the early Eemain seems to provide
exactly the kind of opportunities for the disruption and crisis
conditions for groups of human predecessors that would lead to
the discovery of psychedelic use. Several times there must have
been abrupt changes in habitability of various regions, with
changes in flora and fauna and resulting dietary pressures, food
shortages, the encroachment of and conflict with neighboring
tribes, the possible occurrence of new diseases and a resulting
search for medicinal remedies promoting population movements, in
essence, frequent turmoil. If modern chimpanzees have the need to
roam far and wide to procure their necessary diet including
&quot;fungi, rotten wood, insects, bark, shoots,&quot; we may
safely assume that proto-man had similar if not even greater
exigencies. If uprooted from a home ground, or if rapid climate
change forced him to experiment with new foods, an opportunity
for the discovery of psychedelic plants becomes important. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the case of edible fungi today for example, it
is well known that many, if not the majority of cases of
poisoning result when individuals or groups, newly arrived in an
area, see and consume a mushroom which they had always safely
consumed in their previous home region. Many mushrooms look
nearly identical, and some fungi species are known to be safe in
one region, yet toxic in another. A changing climate might well
alter a fungal species, changing its visible characteristics or
production of metabolites. Some recent work has shown that fungi
tend to proliferate at far greater rates in a tropical, CO2 rich
climate, as must have existed during the Eemian. <a name="back27"></a><a
href="#footnote27">(27)</a> In these facts we see a possible, if
not probable mechanism whereby a group of our ancestors might
have discovered the use of a psychedelic mushroom or other plant,
in which the discovery involved the use of that plant by the
entire group, and for an extended period of time. The likelihood
of widespread existence of unfamiliar and unusual species of
alkaloid-containing plants is, of course, much higher in the
tropical and humid, and fluctuating conditions of the Eemian,
rather than during the dry, cold, and barren ice age conditions
which preceded it. And the dates of the climatic disruptions of
the early Eemian that might have led to such a discovery match
nicely the mtDNA evidence of a population bottleneck. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Eemian might well have been the period of
mankind's first important exposure to psychedelic drugs, for by
90Ka we see the appearance of sophisticated bone harpoons and
knives in what is now Zaire, a level of technology that was not
seen in Europe until 50 thousand years later. <a name="back28"></a><a
href="#footnote28">(28)</a> But we should not expect that the
initial psychedelic exposure would have led to rapid cultural
change as we would today define it. Evidence from studies of
&quot;primitive&quot; yet ecologically stable and wise tribal
societies indicates that psychedelic use and the associated rise
of shamanism does not automatically propel a society towards
building automobiles and atom bombs, but rather, preferentially
enables another kind of creativity involving stability and
equilibrium. Some of the oldest of tribal societies, those that
have been discovered in New Guinea, or in the backwaters of the
Amazon basin, or the vast tundra of the Siberian wilderness, all
have a long tradition of psychedelically influenced shamanism,
and have remained stable for many thousands of years. If we
should look at such a society and call it &quot;primitive,&quot;
their practices being seen as &quot;backward&quot; and
&quot;ignorant,&quot; how much more so may such a stable and
ecological society view the all-too-obvious happenings and
extrapolations of Twentieth Century &quot;Civilization&quot;? Our
view today of what constitutes &quot;progress&quot; and
&quot;civilized living&quot; has practically nothing in common
with the views of hundreds, even thousands of societies that have
come before, and lasted far longer than our recent experiment in
&quot;progress&quot;. With a little luck, the remnants of an
isolated tribe or two may well survive us. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A psychedelically-enlightened society does not at
all produce rampant technological change, just for the sake of
change. They do not fly to the moon just because it is there, or
to impressand propagandize tribal members with their supposed
superiority over a rival tribe in some cold war scenario. A
psychedelically-enabled society does, however, make rapid
advances of a creative nature in response to real challenges such
as climate change, the necessity to emigrate to new regions, the
avoidance of disease and a search for new medicines (chimpanzees
and even elephants have been shown to intentionally search out
and consume effective medicinals as required). But in periods of
climatic and resource-stability the psychedelically-enabled
society also exhibits an ecological stability: it has the power
and intelligence to make creative changes as it pleases, and
chooses consciously to remain in equilibrium with nature. What
could be more illustrative of wisdom than this? In times of
stability, psychedelically-enabled tribes produce myth, art, they
use their creative powers to elaborate tradition, the hallmark of
culture; they do not spend their time in petty schemes to conquer
nature, or exploit reality, or develop &quot;backward&quot;
regions. Perhaps the long term lesson that is taught by the
psychedelic experience is that the human animal, having evolved
slowly over millions of years, is ill-equipped to handle sudden
large advances in technology, which have historically resulted
very reliably in mass production of weapons, ecological
destruction, genocide, waste, and the collapse of civilizations.
Surely there is a better use for creativity than this. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The point here is to give a better view of what a
psychedelically enabled tribe, at the advent of the human race,
might do with its powers of creativity. If our original African
ancestors began the use of psychedelic agents as the first step
toward an organized shamanism, only our modern illusions of what
constitutes &quot;progress&quot; would predict that such a
society, if truly a society of <i>man,</i> would rapidly invent
and amass technology. A broader view would predict that what
would be amassed by the true <i>Homo sapiens</i> would be
techniques of living exhibiting a consciously designed harmony
and ecology, leading to long-lasting modes of tribal life
changing only slowly with time. Psychedelically enlightened
tribes would optimally remain stable for millennia. To restate:
Creativity in such a group would involve the creation and
preservation of myth and ritual, the gradual perfection of a
style of living, the elaboration of tradition, not a headlong
rush into exploitation of &quot;resources&quot; and a supposed
domination of nature. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus our originally psychedelically-enlightened
ancestors, the first humans, would have spread slowly and surely
from their original home, perhaps in East Africa, and carried
with them such traditions of stability and longevity. Only severe
challenges to their survival and continuation would result in
their use of the creative power to make radical changes in their
technology and lifestyle. Before long even a slow migration would
have brought descendants of the original core group into the
Middle East, as evidenced by fossils of modern humans in Israel
dated at 100Ka. <a name="back29"></a><a href="#footnote29">(29)</a>
We must remember that climatic changes after the end of the
Eemian, although following a general tendency toward the next ice
age, continued to include occasional but abrupt reversals as is
shown by the recent Greenland ice core studies. Migration was
likely therefore to have been a sporadic happening, as certain
habitats and food sources changed. Considering these tribes'
penchant for stability, intentional migration, just for the sake
of migration, was unlikely. The spread of our ancestors would
therefore have been slow and occasional, initiated by the
occasional climatic upheavals and other environmental challenges
such as volcanic eruption, changing food supplies, occurrence and
avoidance of diseases, and perhaps the search for new medicines
and psychedelic plants. We know from anthropological studies how
important are the recommendations of the shamans for decisions
taken by tribal elders, and it is thus possible that shamans also
greatly influenced decisions of our early ancestors concerning
their movements. The shamans' use and search for psychedelic
plants may well have initiated some early migrations. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is necessary to understand the above described
tendencies that would naturally follow our original psychedelic
enlightenment to see why modern culture as we know it did not get
underway for over 60 thousand years. Tradition and stability
reigned for many thousands of years while a slow migration
brought human ancestors to Europe, Asia, and finally the
Americas. But the flowering of modern culture did not really get
underway until 40 thousand years ago, when art and body
ornamentation, sophisticated bone tools, built hearths and
structured living spaces, open site &quot;religious&quot;
burials, storage pits and social storage, quarries, the long
distance exchange of raw materials, long term occupation of harsh
environments, and signs of complex forward planning made a wide
appearance as evidenced in the archaeological record. <a
name="back30"></a><a href="#footnote30">(30)</a> This apparently
sudden appearance of the roots of the modern age, in which the
beginnings of modern technology can be seen, is the phenomenon
that has challenged anthropologists the most. If anatomically and
cognitively modern humans began their specieshood in Africa
130Ka, why did it take so long for the modern trend to get
underway? And importantly, what was the catalyst which
precipitated this event so suddenly? Like all history, the
answers to such questions, even if they could be known, must
necessarily be very complex, a story that can be told in a
multitude of ways that might seem contradictory. Consider the
myriad ways the story of the eradication of Native American
populations can be told. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But some scholars have proposed that the sudden
flowering of the modern age beginning about 40Ka might actually
have been more gradual, and sporadic. Such ideas fit in with the
above observations on the likely characteristics of
psychedelically-enlightened societies. The appearance of the
previously-mentioned bone harpoons in Zaire, and other scattered
evidence may well indicate that local tribes made advances in
technology in fits and starts, in response to novel challenges,
and then returned to long periods of stability. The appearance of
cave art seems today from modern discoveries to be rather abrupt,
yet the quality of such art would indicate a long tradition of
artistic endeavor, certainly the artists of the Lascaux and
Cosquer caves were no amateurs, thousands of years of tradition
no doubt led up to their remarkable artistic abilities. New
discoveries of even more ancient sites are bound to indicate that
the first &quot;artists&quot; did not suddenly appear around 40
thousand years ago, but that artistic expression was a slowly
maturing phenomenon of very long duration indeed, going back to
the Eemian perhaps. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychedelic model of evolution of culture
therefore agrees that some recent interpretations of evidence
indicating a &quot;sudden flowering&quot; of culture beginning
about 40Ka is too drastic. Alison Brooks, an archeologist who
with John Yellen made the important finds in Zaire, states: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A closer scrutiny of the archeological record leads one to
    inquire, Just how abrupt was the behavioral transition in
    Europe? I believe that the gulf between the Middle
    Paleolithic and the Upper Paleolithic has been artificially
    widened by de-emphasizing the very real evidence of cultural
    complexity in the former and overstressing the achievement of
    early modern humans, who, in Europe, did not achieve all of
    the behaviors usually cited as part of the Upper Paleolithic
    &quot;revolution&quot; until the very end of the Pleistocene
    [near 10,000 years ago]. <a name="back31"></a><a
    href="#footnote31">(31)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One final surmise about the trigger events that may
have continued to push Early Man along the road to modern
civilization will bring this chapter to a close. If, according to
my theory, there was a gradual evolution of culture during the 70
thousand years between the Eemian and the period in which the
beginnings of modern culture are deemed to have begun 40 thousand
years ago, then we might look for the rapid, yet sporadic and
geographically independent advances in culture and technology to
coincide with known instances of rapid climatic change, with
instances of severe volcanic activity or other known or
to-be-discovered radical environmental influences during the
period. It will certainly be interesting to compare further
detailed analyses of the new Greenland ice cores to known and
future archeological discoveries in an attempt to correlate
cultural change with environmental disruption. Perhaps there will
never be enough evidence to write history about such pre-historic
times, but intriguing clues and parallel developments may well
appear that will at least allow the writing of a probable
scenario. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The question of how geographically isolated groups
of modern men all developed astounding cultural and technological
advances, and how at least two dozen different regional societies
of men experienced along with such changes a dramatic increase in
population, has been a puzzle for many archaeologists, linguists,
anthropologists, and other workers. In the words of Chris
Stringer and Robin McKie, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is an extraordinary catalogue of achievements that seem
    to have come about virtually from nowhere - though obviously
    they did have a source. The question is: what was it? Did we
    bring the seeds of this mental revolution with us when we
    began our African Exodus, though its effects were so subtle
    they took another 50,000 years to accumulate before
    snowballing into a cultural and technological avalanche that
    now threatens to engulf <i>Homo sapiens</i>? Or did that
    final change occur later, and was it therefore more profound,
    and much speedier in its effects? <a name="back32"></a><a
    href="#footnote32">(32)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I believe the answer is neither of these, or rather
a combination of the two: The seeds of the revolution were indeed
carried by <i>Homo sapiens</i> from his birthplace in Africa, but
they were seeds which needed periodic stimulation to grow
vigorously. As I have argued, psychedelic wisdom does not of
itself propel societies to produce a &quot;technological
avalanche&quot; nor should we believe that &quot;technological
avalanches&quot; are inherently good. Psychedelic wisdom rather
leads to ecology, stability, and longevity. But when novel and
severe challenges present themselves to psychedelically-enabled
societies, they are able to react intelligently and with
foresight and complex long-range planning. This is perhaps the
most important difference between the true <i>Homo sapiens</i>
his animal forebears. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus the periodic and now well-established abrupt
climatic upheavals of the post-Eemian world became the catalyst
which successively and cumulatively forced tribes of men living
in many isolated areas of the globe to use their God-like powers
of creativity to advance technology in the interests of survival.
An ice age was approaching, with fits and starts, and global
climatic change was frequent and severe. If the cognitive seeds
existed, dormant in the sense of not automatically producing
technological change at a rate which we moderns believe essential
to our species, and these seeds existed in all the societies of
men around the globe, the fact of climatic change being a global
phenomenon would explain how these seeds flowered, or were forced
to grow independently in all these regions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During the post-Eemian period, changes in the
earth's orbit were responsible for the climatic disruption and
slow onset of a new ice age. But such orbital changes have
sometimes been hypothesized as the catalyst for increased
volcanic activity as well. Whatever the cause, at least one
extremely severe volcanic eruption occurred during the period
leading up to that famous starting date for the beginning of
modern technology, and in line with my proposals, may have been a
major event pushing tribal societies around the world toward
radical changes in the effort to survive. Stringer and McKie tell
of the eruption: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Earth was gripped by continuing climatic mayhem as
    changes in its orbit began inexorably to push down the
    world's thermostat. Then to add to these woes, about 74,000
    years ago, Mount Toba on the island of Sumatra exploded in
    the largest volcanic eruption of the past 450 million years.
    The blast was 4,000 times more powerful than that of Mount St
    Helens and would have sent more than 1,000 cubic kilometres
    of dust and ash into the atmosphere, plunging the earth into
    years-long volcanic winters. Summer temperatures could have
    dropped by as much as twelve degrees centigrade, while
    forests shrank, deserts spread, and in eastern Asia, a
    prolonged winter monsoon would have swept clouds of dust from
    inland deserts round the globe... Having evolved in warm
    Savannah sun we nearly perished, huddled in cold dismal
    misery as volcanic plumes straddled the earth. <a
    name="back33"></a><a href="#footnote33">(33)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Examination of some recent charts of sea-levels and
estimated prevailing temperatures reveals that this event seems
to have brought on the most severe period of the last ice age.
The post-Eemian climate between 115Ka to 75Ka is now known to be
more changeable, the Greenland ice core data showing several
abrupt reversals, yet the same data show that after a significant
warming period peaking about 75Ka to 80Ka, a severe decline then
led into the very coldest period of the ice age. The whole of the
post-Eemian climatic turmoil may well have been the partner to
those original African seeds of modern culture which required
such periodic stimulation to grow. The volcanic eruption might
have been one of the most important instances driving societies
to improvise and find technological solutions in order to
survive, the aftermath of the Mount Toba event would have
disrupted flora and fauna world-wide, it would have caused food
shortages, driven intentional and planned migration in search of
resources, brought about wide experimentation with new foods and
medicinal plants, and perhaps even led to the appearance of new
or altered species of psychedelic plants such as the fungi which
might have proliferated in the wake of widespread forest death
and an abundance of decaying vegetation. <i>Psilocybe cyanescens</i>
for example, usually a fairly rare species, thrives in decaying
woody debris and in colder climes. It is also one of the more
powerful <i>Psilocybe</i> species. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is certainly a difficult task to sift and weigh
all these factors in the attempt to propose a concise scenario
for psychedelic influence on early man. Two or more seemingly
contradictory scenarios might well have happened simultaneously
in different regions, or consecutively. The idea of psychedelic
evolution is still too new, and much more work will have to take
place with these new hypotheses in mind, trying to prove and
disprove the many resulting implications before we can decide on
a likely scenario. As I have said, this task is more than just
the construction of a temporary model, it is an attempt to
discover actual history and subject to real error. </p>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At a party in Chicago, a young man under the
influence of LSD seized a live kitten and ate it. Later, in an
effort to explain his action, he said he had felt an urgent need
to experience everything. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The story is revolting, of course, and possibly
apocryphal; but the incident is by no means improbable, and it
does make the point&#151;that LSD is powerful medicine, and that
the consequences of its use are often bizarre and terrifying.
While it now appears that health authorities have exaggerated the
threat of self-destruction or mental breakdown, the fact remains
that LSD is dangerous. The nature of the danger, however, may be
other than is commonly supposed, and it is possible the alarmists
are not nearly as alarmed as they should be. Almost anything may
happen when LSD produces the negative reaction that inner-space
voyagers refer to as a &quot;bad trip,&quot; and such a reaction
is by no means uncommon; but LSD also can result in a good trip,
which is more to the point, and the good trip may in the long run
have graver consequences than the bad. Indeed, there are
implications in the use of LSD which are far more disturbing
perhaps than an occasional suicide or psychosis. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Assume just for a moment that LSD's cultists are
actually doing what they suppose they are doing. If you can take
their own word for it, they have been tinkering with the gears of
the universe. They have rushed in where Sigmund Freud feared to
tread, invading a region of the human psyche from which the
father of psychoanalysis recoiled in horror. They have penetrated
a realm of Egyptian darkness&#151;courageously, perhaps, or
recklessly it may be&#151;and in doing so they have raised
fundamental questions about man and God. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever the answers, the questions are valid. They
are not new questions but very old ones, and some have their
roots in a philosophical tradition which predates Western
civilization. LSD has merely given them a renewed emphasis. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover, the LSD cults are not an isolated
phenomenon. There is some evidence that they represent only one
aspect of a psychic revolt whose manifestations can be detected
today in the areas of theology, psychology, and ethics. For
example, the cults appear to have a relationship to the radical
New Theology, and especially to the ultra-radical Death of God
theology. In essence, the LSD cultists are saying the same thing
that some of the Death of God prophets have said. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From one point of view, LSD presents the orthodox
church with a challenge more awesome than the Turk and the
comet&#151; from which, good Lord, deliver us. It casts doubt on
the validity of religious experience as a whole, suggesting that
the mystical awareness of God is nothing more than
chemistry&#151;and therefore a delusion. From another point of
view, however, the drug raises just as many questions for the
atheist as it does for the church. It challenges the scientist as
well as the priest. And some of its more extravagant enthusiasts
believe it will lead the way to a rebirth of the spirit&#151;to a
new Age of Faith in which man's soul in the twentieth century
will win an ultimate victory over materialism and a skeptical
science. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its members in fact have described the drug
movement as religious&#151;if not a religion&#151;and some groups
already have incorporated as churches. But if there is to be a
new age, there also will be a new faith, for the LSD cultists in
many cases are promulgating concepts which basically are alien to
popular Western theology. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the
New Theology has been its re-emphasis of the concept of <i>immanence</i>,
or the indwelling nature of God&#151;as opposed to <i>transcendence</i>,
or the &quot;otherness&quot; of God. While immanence as such is
by no means heretical, in the drug movement and in Death of God
theology immanence is carried all the way to its radical
conclusion, where it becomes pantheism. Pantheism of course is an
Eastern concept, and the West has regarded it as anathema,
describing it invariably as &quot;a vague pantheism&quot;&#151;as
opposed presumably to such crystal-clear doctrines as
transubstantiation and trinitarianism. But pantheism is not
vague. Whatever the merits of the idea, it is perfectly clear-cut
and straightforward in its assertion: <i>God is Man</i>. Or God
is the Universe. There is nothing very complicated about that,
and that is pantheism. It is, by and large, the Eastern view of
divinity. By and large, it represents the direction in which the
drug movement appears to be headed. And, in so many words, it
sums up the position of the theological school represented by Dr.
Thomas J. J. Altizer. When Altizer says God is Dead, he means
simply that God is Man. Altizer is a pantheist, and he admits he
is a pantheist. His pantheism is not quite the same as the
Eastern version, as we shall see further on; but it is
nonetheless pantheism and basically therefore an Oriental
concept. In this respect, along with LSD, it hints at a
development that could have considerable significance for Western
society. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; East is still East, and West is still West, but
there is evidence now that the twain have started to meet, and at
a point where one might least have expected it: the point of
religious metaphysics. It appears that there is presently
occurring, especially in America, a wholesale introduction of
Asian theories regarding the nature of man and the cosmos. This
development began long ago, in a small way, in the New England of
Emerson and Thoreau, but it seems to have accelerated
tremendously since the Second World War. Sages throughout history
have prophesied the day when the Wise Men of the Orient would
join hands&#151;or lock horns&#151;with the Wise Men of the
Occident, and signs abound that the day has arrived as a natural
consequence of the shrinking of the globe. In a sense, the
immanent God of the East has come knocking at the door of the
transcendent God of the West, and it is possible that we are
witnesses today to a kind of cosmic shoot-out at the O.K. Corral.
It would be premature to assess the full impact of the encounter
or its likely denouement, but there seems to be little doubt that
the encounter is taking place and that certain fundamentals of
Eastern thought are being integrated or assimilated into Western
culture. In its initial stages the development preceded both
radical theology and the drug movement; but it is obvious that
these are related to the development, just as they are related to
each other, and it would be worthwhile perhaps to judge them at
least partially within this wider context. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Within such a context, LSD and the Death of God
oppose orthodoxy in crucial areas of doctrine. Not only do they
dispute the idea of Theism, or a personal and transcendent deity,
but they also question such concepts as pluralism, resurrection,
personal immortality, grace, evil, and redemption or atonement
through the intercession of some supernatural agency. In short,
they leave man pretty much on his own, with nobody to turn to but
himself and with no place to seek salvation except inwardly, in
the recesses of his own inner Being. Putting these doctrinal
concerns to one side, the drug movement challenges the church in
its functional role as well. According to the LSD cultists, men
today are thirsting for the direct, personal experience of
God&#151; regardless of his actual nature. In other words, it
matters not whether God lies within or without; in either case,
men need and want a sense of direct communion with the ultimate
source of their faith. This divine-human encounter is not found
in church, where little or nothing is done to promote it. But it
is found in LSD, the cultists believe. Thus LSD challenges the
church to do as well and offer as much. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The debate spills over into the province of
psychology, where a related movement is under way to establish
standards of behavior and adaptation based on universal truths
rather than social norms. Mental health would be defined in terms
of man's actual nature or Being, and LSD might prove a helpful
tool in determining what that nature or Being really is. Such a
program of course would introduce psychology to the field of
values and ethics, which many have argued is a field that
psychology should have occupied long before now. And it might
open the way to the development of a humanistic morality founded
on man's true nature, replacing those legalistic moralities which
are founded on cultural mores or instinctive but arbitrary
notions of right and wrong. Coincidentally, this movement comes
at a time when psychoanalysts are doing their best to repress a
theory that schizophrenia is a physical disease, best treated by
massive doses of Vitamin B-3. The theory reduces Freud more or
less to the status of a witch doctor, and it raises the
possibility at least of a common origin for insanity, religious
mysticism, and LSD experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It may be that all of these movements are
interrelated in still another fashion, reflecting a revived
interest in the study of metaphysics&#151;and especially that
branch of metaphysics termed ontology, or the metaphysics of
Being: the study of life's essential nature. Academic philosophy
had largely abandoned metaphysics in favor of an arcane
linguistic analysis, and churchmen for the most part had turned
their attention to such mundane considerations as ecumenicism,
internal renewal, and civil rights. Now it appears that
metaphysics has come into its own again&#151;both inside the
church and out of it, but mostly out of it, and not so much yet
in the universities. And this is just a fancy way of saying that
people have started once more to ask ultimate questions. They are
asking who they are, and who God is, and what is the
relationship, if any, between them and him. Altizer is asking
these questions, and so is the hipster who seeks cosmic fireworks
in an LSD sugar cube. They are asking the questions that Gauguin
asked on his canvas: &quot;Where Do We Come From? What Are We?
Where Are We Going?&quot; It might be said that men have found
themselves confronted by two kinds of questions, problems and
mysteries. In recent years, men have dealt primarily with the
problems; but the mysteries are now and always will be the source
of the world's essential anxieties and aspirations, and it
appears that men are probing afresh into the mysteries, including
the <i>mysterium tremendum</i>. They are seeking again the pearl
of great price. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The asking of ultimate questions is significant in
itself. It implies an assumption that there are ultimate answers,
and that these answers moreover are accessible to men. In recent
times, it seems fair to say, this assumption has not been widely
held or widely expressed. Even proud science has gone mute on the
subject, having painted itself into that corner known as
Heisenberg's Principle of Uncertainty. As a result, it has been
said, the very best we can hope for apparently is that science
one day will be able to describe everything&#151;and explain
nothing. But the new search for answers is not predicated upon
scientific principles, nor indeed is it predicated upon orthodox
religious principles; it seems to reject both the Scribes and the
Pharisees, the scientists and the formal religionists. If it does
in fact constitute a religious revival, which is open to
argument, it is one which is bypassing the church's magisterium.
It is eclectic, and it rejects all outward authority. On the
other hand, it does accept the basic religious premise, as
William James defined it: &quot;the belief that there is an
unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously
adjusting ourselves thereto.&quot; Fundamentally, today's pearl
seekers are following Plato's injunction. They are striving for
an explanation of Being, which all true lovers of knowledge must
have as their final object, Plato said. They are inquiring into
the nature of their own Being and into the nature of Being
itself. And they are conducting the inquiry by turning inward
upon themselves, like flowers closing their petals in the night
of doubt. Like poppies, one might add, or possibly morning
glories and lotuses. But that is another question. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All in all, the challenge appears to be directed
toward the laboratory more than the pulpit. The implications of
the drug movement are basically anti-science rather than
anti-church, and they offer grounds for some far-reaching
speculation. We spoke earlier of a possible psychic revolt, and
we might ask whether this is not in fact suggested now by the
widespread interest in LSD and by related developments in radical
theology and psychology. Are these perhaps omens of a
counter-swing of the psychic pendulum? Over the centuries, as the
classical historian Edith Hamilton has observed, that pendulum
has swung back and forth: from the rational to the intuitive,
from the seen to the unseen, from the conscious to the
unconscious. Whenever one alternative has failed to answer man's
questions or to meet his needs, he has turned invariably to the
other option; it follows, therefore, that the apparent challenge
now is not merely to science but to rational thought as such. And
this is necessarily so. It can be argued that the erosion of
religious belief has not been caused so much by the specific
revelations of science; rather, it is a result of the empirical
method which science has utilized to obtain those
revelations&#151;of the introduction into the culture of a
show-me frame of reference which might be characterized as the
Missouri Syndrome. If empiricism has proved a disappointment, as
indeed it has, it is entirely possible that the instinctive and
unconscious forces of the mind may be rising again now in
opposition to the rational and the conscious; the spiritual
element may be reasserting itself in an era when scientific
rationalism had appeared to be solidly entrenched. An outburst of
mysticism perhaps has been simmering on the rear burner for some
time, in fact, and, if you care to, you might trace the
possibility back to the anti-rational philosophy of Henri
Bergson. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now LSD has turned up the flame. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, a revolt is not a revolution. The flame
could die&#151; from lack of oxygen&#151;and empiricism may be
just as impregnable as it thought it was. But the movements of
the time deserve serious attention even if they do not, for the
moment, seem to be leading anywhere or offering much substance.
What men search for, after all, is just as significant in a sense
as that which they find, providing some measure at least of their
nature and their needs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But suppose the revolt did ripen into a revolution.
Would that necessarily be a bad thing? What, if any, are the
dangers involved? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The main danger, already apparent, is the
possibility that these various movements could lead to a sort of
neo-Gnostic rejection of the world&#151;a retreat from the
concrete, as it were, resulting in the kind of pipe-dream
lethargy which characterizes so much of India and the Middle
East, and which is symbolized in turn by the Hindu contemplative
and the Arab hashish-eater: the one held spellbound by an idea,
the other by a drug. And perhaps the gravest challenge is not
after all to science, or to rationalism, but to the world as
such. Not just the values of the world, not just social goals,
but the world itself, as earth and substance. The danger in this
case arises from Oriental concepts of the world as some kind of
illusion, trick, or snare for the senses. According to this point
of view, the world does not really exist. It's all done with
mirrors, and the purpose of life is to realize this fact, such
realization bringing with it an immediate release from the world
where man is held captive by his own ignorance. Upon such release
the enlightened one attains the eternal bliss of nirvana, beyond
appearances. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What we have called a danger&#151;and the Hindu
calls a blessing&#151;is not a problem in so far as radical
theology is concerned. New Theology is utterly committed to the
world, having turned away from the heavens, and Death of God
theology actually rejoices in the world, embraces it, cherishes
it, and does all but make love to it. Contrary to their popular
image, the Death of God people are by and large a jolly and
optimistic lot. As the radical theologian William Hamilton
expressed it, in so many words: Prufrock, no; Ringo, yes. As far
as he is concerned, the Wasteland has been transformed into a
latter-day Canaan. Man is no longer alienated from the world,
according to Hamilton. Man is &quot;quite at home in this
world.&quot; And next to Altizer, Hamilton is a gloomy Gus. All
this happy talk stems directly from the fact that God is no
longer around to spoil the fun, so to speak. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The danger of world rejection exists within the
drug movement, where one hears cultists referring to the Net of
Illusion and the Quagmire of Phenomena. But even if you grant the
basic validity of the drug experience, it does not necessarily
follow that the world is a hoax. After all, there are Oriental
philosophies and Oriental philosophies. The Hindu and the Zen
Buddhist start from the same point of view; they share a common
experience, and they argue from the same evidence. But they
arrive at antipodal conclusions. The Hindu appears at least to
deny the world, while the Zen Buddhist affirms it. So it is
possible for the drug movement to go either way: toward a total
rejection of the world or a total commitment to the world. To
help clarify the alternatives, we shall explore the conclusions
of Zen and related concepts in some detail. To provide still
another option, we shall look into the evolutionary-theological
theories of Teilhard de Chardin, applying them to the questions
raised by LSD and Asian metaphysics. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In sum, it is the argument of this book that a
relationship exists between LSD cultism and radical theology;
that both offer a legitimate challenge to orthodox theology; that
both reflect an introduction into the West of Eastern religious
ideas; that LSD may provide the basis for a humanistic ethics;
that contemporary currents indicate a renewed interest in
metaphysics in general, ontology in particular; that there is
some evidence of a nascent revolt against science and
rationalism; that all of these developments carry with them both
dangers and promises. If the church is challenged, it has been
challenged before. If men have lost their God before, they have
always managed, somehow, to find him again. If legitimate
questions are raised, there also are legitimate answers to those
questions, and we shall suggest what some of them might be. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The drug movement has been characterized as a
weak-kneed retreat from reality. In reply, the cultists assert
that the truth is just the other way around: it is we who flee
reality and they who accept it. They alone have faced the
dreadful knowledge that comes when one encounters the Clear Light
of the Void. Only they have dared to turn and see what makes
those flickering shadows on the wall of the cave. Possibly the
only way to settle the question is to follow these explorers all
the way and enter with them into the secret inner world they say
they have discovered. And if you do that . . . well, they are not
cowards. They are very brave, perhaps, or very wise, or very dull
and foolish. Craven they are not. </p>

<h2>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Through psychedelic eyes</h2>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On a good trip the LSD voyager may feel he has
penetrated to the godhead itself. But is it really the godhead he
sees? Or is it the Medusa? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before we describe what LSD does, let us first ask
what it is. That is a much easier question to handle, admittedly,
and it is mildly ironic that this is so. Where the mysteries of
nature are concerned, the situation is usually reversed, as
Bertrand Russell has pointed out in the case of electricity.
Science can describe very accurately what electricity does but
hasn't the foggiest notion what it really is. As for LSD, it is a
synthetic drug: d-lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate, compounded
from a constituent of a rye fungus known as ergot. Its general
history by now is a twice-told tale and then some, so we shall be
brief about it. LSD was first synthesized in 1938 by Dr. Albert
Hofmann, a biochemist at the Sandoz pharmaceutical firm in Basel,
Switzerland; but the scientist did not know what he had created
until 1943, when he accidentally inhaled or otherwise absorbed a
small amount of LSD and thus discovered the drug's curious
properties. It produced uncanny distortions of space and time and
hallucinations that were weird beyond belief. It also produced a
state of mind in which the objective world appeared to take on a
new and different meaning. These effects, and the agents which
produce them, are now referred to as psychedelic &#151;a generic
term which means &quot;mind manifesting,&quot; which in turn
means nothing. The word has come into common usage simply because
of its neutral connotation; due to the controversy involved, it
is the only word so far that all sides have been willing to
accept. It is used as both noun and adjective. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike heroin, opium, and alcohol, LSD apparently
is not addictive. This means simply that prolonged use of the
drug, so far as we can tell at this time, does not create a <i>physiological</i>
craving or dependency based on changes in a subject's body
chemistry&#151;changes that are produced by liquor and
junk&#151;and there are no physiological withdrawal symptoms when
use of the drug is terminated. LSD on the other hand may be <i>psychologically</i>
habituating; but this, after all, can also be said of chewing gum
and television. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There are literally scores of psychedelic
substances, natural and synthetic, and LSD is only one of many
agents capable of producing a full-fledged psychedelic
experience. Identical effects can be obtained from Indian hemp
and its derivatives, including hashish; from the peyote cactus
and its extract, mescaline; from a Mexican mushroom and its
laboratory counterpart, psilocybin, which Dr. Hofmann synthesized
in 1958. Hemp and peyote have been used as psychedelics for
centuries, and mescaline was on the market before the turn of the
century. LSD's uniqueness lies in the fact that it is very easy
to make&#151; and mega-potent. According to the Food and Drug
Administration, a single gram of LSD can provide up to ten
thousand doses, each of them capable of producing an experience
lasting up to twelve hours or longer. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Scientists seized upon the drug as a tool for
research and therapy, and literally thousands of technical papers
have been devoted to it. Since LSD appeared to mimic some
symptoms of psychosis, it offered possible insights into the
sufferings of mental patients&#151;although psychotherapists
later came to doubt that it produces what was first referred to
as a model psychosis. Preliminary research indicated it might be
useful in the treatment of alcoholism and neurosis, and it also
served to ease the anguish of terminal patients. In small doses,
in controlled situations, it appeared to enhance creativity and
productivity. But the public at large knew nothing of LSD until
1963, when two professors, Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, lost
their posts at Harvard University in the wake of charges that
they had involved students in reckless experiments with the drug.
Leary went on to become more or less the titular leader of the
drug movement, in which capacity he soon ran afoul of the law,
and the movement spread to campuses and cities across the
country. By and large, it seemed at first to develop as a
middle-class phenomenon, attracting to its ranks mainly students
and intellectuals, liberal ministers, artists and professional
people, as well as bearded pariahs. Official panic provoked a
wave of legislation which ended or seriously hindered almost all
legitimate research programs; the legislation did little or
nothing to discourage the drug movement, which received its
supplies from black market sources. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Depending upon the point of view, Dr. Hofmann
assumed the role of a Prometheus or Pandora. In correspondence I
once asked him if he sometimes felt like the latter, to which he
replied: &quot;In my opinion, every discovery in the field of
natural science is to be positively viewed, and thus also the
discovery of LSD. If one wishes to deplore the discovery of LSD,
then one must also view the discovery of morphine negatively, for
morphine, one of the most valuable gifts of pharmacy, is just as
dangerous and destructive as LSD when used improperly. There are
no forces in the universe that are bad in themselves. It is
always up to man whether he will make good or bad use of
them.&quot; And if Dr. Hofmann's words have a familiar ring,
perhaps they are reminiscent of the statements nuclear physicists
were making in 1945. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; LSD is a colorless, odorless, tasteless drug. It is
taken orally for the most part, and the precise nature of its
action upon the brain and nervous system has not been determined.
It is believed, however, that only a minute portion of the tiny
dose ever reaches the brain, and even this disappears in less
than an hour. Possibly, then, LSD sets off a reaction which
continues long after the drug itself has been dissipated. As Dr.
Sidney Cohen, a leading medical authority on LSD, expressed it,
&quot;The drug acts to trigger a chain of metabolic processes
which then proceed to exert an effect for many hours
afterward.&quot; In hipsters' terminology, the subject is
&quot;turned on.&quot; And the experience begins. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The nature of the experience will depend on
countless factors, which are commonly summed up as
&quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot;: that is, the mood of the
subject and the environment in which the drug is administered.
The subject becomes highly suggestible, and the slightest false
note can result in the nightmare of a bad trip. Most experiences
will include a hallucinatory period, in which fantastic visions
occur, and in some cases it is possible to see sounds and hear
colors&#151;the result of sensory short-circuiting, referred to
in the literature as synesthesia. One subject reported that he
could taste the categorical imperative (which he said was
something like veal). These very weird effects have received
considerable publicity; when they are pleasurable, they&#151;and
sometimes sexual stimulation&#151;constitute what may be regarded
as the &quot;kicks&quot; aspect of LSD. But the drug movement
cultists are not concerned with kicks in this sense. Skilled
travelers say they can avoid the hallucinatory period altogether
and thus are able to achieve and prolong the &quot;central
experience.&quot; There does appear to be such an experience, and
this is what the cultists refer to when they speak of a good
trip. It does not always occur, and some people may never achieve
it; it must be sought after, perhaps, and expectation may be a
significant factor in its production. But it does exist, and it
is the very basis of the cult. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From various sources, then, let us see if we can
construct a typology of this central or core experience. While
the problems of description are notorious, in most cases the mind
will appear to operate at a new level of consciousness in which: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. The sense of self or personal ego is utterly
lost. Awareness of individual identity evaporates. &quot;I&quot;
and &quot;me&quot; are no more. Subject-object relationships
dissolve, and the world no longer ends at one's fingertips: the
world is simply an extension of the body, or the mind. The world
shimmers, as if it were charged with a high-voltage current, and
the subject feels he could melt into walls, trees, other persons.
It is not that the world lacks substance; it is real, but one is
somehow conterminous with it. And it is fluid, shifting. One is
keenly aware of the atomic substructure of reality; he can feel
the spinning motion of the electrons in what he used to call his
body, and he senses the incredible emptiness that lies within the
atoms, where the electron planets circle their proton suns at
distances which are comparably as vast as those in the solar
system itself. Thus it seems only natural that one could pass
through a wall, if only it were possible to get all the atoms
lined up properly for just one moment. In the vastness of outer
space, is it not a fact that billion-starred galaxies are able to
drift through each other like clouds of smoke or astral ghosts,
without the single collision of one star with another? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for identity, it is not really lost. On the
contrary, it is found; it is expanded to include all that is seen
and all that is not seen. What occurs is simply
depersonalization. The subject looks back on his pre-drug
existence as some sort of game or make-believe in which, for some
reason, he had felt called upon to assume the reduced identity or
smaller self called &quot;I.&quot; Being had concentrated its
attention at a single point in order to create, and play, the
game of writer, banker, cat burglar. Or so it now seems. If there
is any analogy to this in normal existence, is it not perhaps the
moment when one awakens from sleep? In that case, what is the
first thing one asks oneself? &quot;Where am I?&quot; Or isn't it
rather, &quot;Who am I?&quot; And then, in an effort of will,
attention is concentrated to re-create the role that was lost in
sleep. Thus in the drug experience, as in sleep, the normal state
of tension is relaxed. Home at last, after that dreadful party,
Being slips out of her stays, so to speak, and breathes an
ontological sigh of celestial relief. Consciousness is allowed to
scatter, and the subject at last can be Himself again. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The subject is somehow united with the Ground of
his Being, with the life force that has created the visible
world. He <i>remembers</i>. And what he remembers is the true
identity that underlies all the individual egos of the world. He
is one again with the universe, the eternal, the Absolute. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He has found himself again. He is made whole again.
That which he once knew, he has remembered. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (But when did he know it? And when did he forget?) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Time stops. Or, in any case, it ceases to be
important. And perhaps it would be more accurate to say that
memory and forethought stop. The subject is content to exist in
the moment&#151; in the here and now. And time has no meaning in
the here and now. Bergson suggested that the sense of time
consists simply of arrests of our attention. Seconds and minutes
do not really exist; they are artificially created
&quot;immobilities&quot; dreamed up by science, which is unable
to comprehend flux, mobility, or the dynamic character of life
itself. Installed within true movement, said Bergson, the mind
would lose its normal sense of time, since the normal function of
the intellect is to foresee, so as to act upon things. &quot;We
must strive to see in order to see,&quot; he said, &quot;and no
longer to see in order to act.&quot; This is precisely what
happens in the psychedelic experience, where forethought is
anesthetized. Without forethought there is no anticipation.
Without anticipation there is no desire. And time stops. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Words lose all meaning. In the here and now
there are no abstractions. An object represents only that which
it is. It is perceived as a <i>Ding-an-Sich</i>, a
thing-in-itself, and it matters not whether Kant said that sort
of perception is impossible. Kant never took LSD. If he had, he
would have known that rose is a rose is a rose is a rose. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The same feeling is captured in childhood perhaps.
As Wordsworth wrote, recalling his boyish days when nature was
all in all: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . . .
    I cannot paint <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; What then I was. The sounding cataract <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Their colours and their forms, were then to me <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; An appetite; a feeling and a love, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; That had no need of a remoter charm, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; By thought supplied, nor any interest <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Unborrowed from the eye.&#151;That time is
    past, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; And all its aching joys are now no more, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; And all its dizzy raptures. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychedelic experience is similar but
multiplied at least a thousand times over. Coincidentally,
Havelock Ellis wrote, after experimenting with mescaline in the
1890's: &quot;If it should ever chance that the consumption of
mescal becomes a habit, the favorite poet of the mescal drinker
will certainly be Wordsworth.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But thing-in-itself perception is beyond all
language. It is, in fact, the antithesis of language, which is
the real cause of our normal inability to see the
thing-in-itself. This is so because we think in words, and words
are abstractions or symbols of things; as a result, we tend to
think and perceive in symbols. Thus the American flag fluttering
on the Fourth of July is seen in terms of Concord and Lexington.
The flag-in-itself is never seen; we must always associate it
with something else. And so on. And the English language is
especially crippling because of its painful stress on simile and
metaphor. Thus a rose isn't a rose; it's what my love is like.
Ruskin quite properly attacked the pathetic fallacy as evidence
of a &quot;morbid state of mind.&quot; But the psychedelic
experience suggests that all figures of speech reflect the same
unhealthy attitude&#151;and that speech itself is a web of
deceit. The Greek poets sensed this. For the Greeks, as Edith
Hamilton pointed out, a thing of beauty was never a symbol of
something else, but only itself. A star was just a star, a
primrose a primrose. &quot;That a skylark was like a glow-worm
golden in a dell of dew, or like a poet hidden in the light of
thought, would have been straight nonsense to them. A skylark was
just a skylark. Birds were birds and nothing else, but how
beautiful a thing was a bird, 'that flies over the foam of the
wave with careless heart, sea-purple bird of spring.&quot;' And
if symbols as such are deceptive, how much worse are the symbols
of use. We look at a peach, and we see something to eat. We look
at a field, and we wonder how many bushels of wheat it will
yield. We meet somebody for the first time, and we ask ourselves
what this new person can do for us. Can we play bridge with him?
Sell him some insurance? Worst of all, we look at our loved ones
even in terms of our own needs, emotional and otherwise. In the
terminology of Martin Buber, we live in the world of I-It. We
associate things, and we use things, and we never look at the
thing-in-itself in the here and now. Moreover, we cannot look
upon an object without thinking the word which symbolizes it.
Tree. Lamp. Table. But the psychedelic world is the world of pure
experience and pure relation; it is the world of I-Thou. In this
world, for example, a tree is not a source of timber or shade. A
tree is to look at. And it is not a tree. It is <i>that</i>,
there. Now. And that is a that is a that is a that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. There are no dualities. Sweet and sour, good and
evil&#151; these also are abstractions, inventions of the verbal
mind, and they have no place in the ultimate reality of here and
now. As a result, the world is just as it should be. It is
perfect, beautiful. It is the same world that is seen without
LSD, but it is seen in a different way. It is transfigured, and
it requires no meaning beyond the astonishing fact of its own
existence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What does &quot;meaning&quot; mean anyhow? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meaning is just one more abstraction, implying some
future use or purpose; it has no place in the here and now of
naked existence. And is this perhaps the significance of the Eden
story? They ate of the tree in the midst of the garden, and their
eyes were opened, and they became as gods, knowing good and evil.
The first dualism, fundamental to all others. What does this
story represent if not the introduction into the world of a new
way of thinking and a new form of perception? What does it refer
to if not the evolutionary product we describe so proudly as
intellect, or the rational mind? What does it signify if not that
moment when man looked about him and said for the first time:
&quot;This is wrong.&quot; Not, &quot;This hurts me,&quot; or
&quot;The tiger is chewing my leg, and I wish he wouldn't.&quot;
No. &quot;This is <i>wrong</i>.&quot; What an idea! What a
curious concept. No doubt it was the greatest, or worst, idea
that man ever had. It marks that point in the process of becoming
when life took charge of itself. Man had accepted the world; now
he decided to judge it. Thus Adam became the first
existentialist, taking upon himself the nauseating responsibility
that turned Sartre's stomach. In doing so he laid the basis for
those existential anxieties which are nothing more or less than
ontological anxieties. He estranged himself from his environment;
worse yet, he alienated himself from the very Ground of his
Being. In Eden he had lived in perfect I-Thou relation, neither
judging things nor subsuming them with words. East of Eden lay
the world of I-It, where the ground was cursed for his sake, and
the Lord told him what he could expect from it. Thorns and
thistles he could expect from it. So Adam was cast out of the
garden, his own mind the flaming sword that would prevent his
return. He lived in the world of I-It, and he sought there for
meaning. But he never found it, and none of those who came after
him have found it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Men are frustrated in the search by their I-It
minds of use, which have made meaning synonymous with purpose.
Nothing is meaningful unless it leads to something else, or
produces some future effect. Thus a man smokes <i>to</i> enjoy
himself&#151; and that is a meaningless action. But he puts on
his shoes <i>so</i> he can go to the store&#151;and that by
definition is meaningful. But it is not meaningful enough, and
man craves for an ultimate meaning. He wants his life to lead to
something else, somewhere in the future. It doesn't, apparently,
so he feels the anxiety of meaninglessness. Taking hope, however,
he diagnoses his anxiety as a form of psychic pain. The sense of
meaninglessness is meaningful in itself, he decides; it implies
there is a meaning somewhere, and he is estranged from it. Which
is so. But the ultimate meaning he seeks is in fact the absence
of meaning&#151;in the sense of purpose. Meaning is simple
existence in the here and now. And of course man already lives in
the here and now. The trouble is, he doesn't know how to live in
it. And this is what LSD seems to tell him. It tells him that he
is still in Eden, if only he knew it. It is only necessary to
spit out the apple and look at the world through psychedelic
eyes. The apple is his intellect, or way of looking at things,
and under LSD his intellect no longer functions. Forethought is
put to sleep, and he opens his eyes upon Paradise regained. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A voice whispers in his ear. It tells him: <i>&quot;Essence
precedes existence.&quot;</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. The subject feels he knows, essentially,
everything there is to know. He knows ultimate truth. And what's
more, he knows that he knows it. Yet this sense of authority
cannot be verbalized (any more than the experience as a whole can
be verbalized) because the experience is a whole which cannot be
divided, and it transcends all partial abstractions. What is
known is pure Being, which cannot be compared with anything else.
The subject is identical with that which he knows and therefore
is speechless. In any case, language can never describe that
which language itself is responsible for negating. Finally, there
is the problem raised by H. G. Wells in his tale of &quot;The
Richest Man in Bogota.&quot; To a race of eyeless men, how do you
explain sight? What words do you use? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This describes the psychedelic experience, produced
by a chemical. But it also describes something else. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It describes religious mysticism. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It describes the experience of saints and prophets
since the first tick of history's clock. And it describes as well
those flashes of insight that sometimes come to humbler folk in
moments of prayer, or of grace. </p>

<h2>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Chemistry and mysticism</h2>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In its broadest sense, mysticism refers to direct
communion with the divine; to intuitive knowledge of ultimate
truth; to the soul's sense of union with the absolute reality
that is the Ground, or the source, of its Being. And apparently
it is impossible to distinguish this experience from the central
experience produced by LSD and other psychedelic agents. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The classic accounts of mystical experience read
like psychedelic Baedekers. In recent years, moreover, a number
of studies have compared the two experiences, and the results
have reinforced the idea that the experiences are in some way
connected. The best known of these studies was undertaken by
psychiatrist Walter Pahnke at Harvard University, where
psilocybin was administered in a religious setting to ten
theology students. Nine of the ten felt they had genuine
religious experiences, and Pahnke concluded that the phenomena
they reported were &quot;indistinguishable from, if not identical
with,&quot; a typology based on W. T. Stace's widely known
summary of mystical experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At Princeton, students were shown accounts of a
religious experience and a psychedelic experience, and two-thirds
of the students identified the drug-induced experience as the
religious one. In a book in which they summarize five separate
studies, including Pahnke's, R. E. L. Masters and Jean Houston
stated that &quot;religious-type&quot; experiences were reported
by 32 to 75 per cent of subjects who received psychedelics in
&quot;supportive&quot; settings, and by 75 to 90 per cent of
those who received them in settings that included religious
stimuli. And so on. The consensus of research seems to be that
the two experiences are at least phenomenologically the same.
This is a way of saying: &quot;Well, they certainly <i>look</i>
the same, and beyond that I'm not going to stick my neck
out.&quot; What this neatly avoids, of course, is the problem of
comparing the <i>sources</i> of the experiences. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Significant parallels to psychedelic experience are
to be found in William James's observations on religious
conversion, the faith-state, and mystical experience. Conversion
occurs, said James, when a formerly divided self becomes unified,
and &quot;a not infrequent consequence of the change operated in
the subject is a transfiguration of the face of nature in his
eyes. A new heaven seems to shine upon a new earth.&quot; James
made the point that &quot;self-surrender has been and always must
be regarded as the vital turning-point of the religious
life.&quot; And the total abnegation of self or ego is without
question the hallmark of psychedelic experience. &quot;Only when
I become as nothing,&quot; wrote James, &quot;can God enter in
and no difference between his life and mine remain
outstanding.&quot; Discussing the faith-state, James observed
that it too is characterized by an objective change in the
appearance of the world, which takes on a sweet and beautiful
newness. &quot;It was dead and is alive again. It is like the
difference between looking on a person without love, or upon the
same person with love.&quot; In addition, there is a loss of all
worry: &quot;the sense that all is ultimately well with one&quot;
and a &quot;willingness to be.&quot; Finally, there is &quot;the
sense of perceiving truths not known before,&quot; and these
&quot;more or less unutterable in words.&quot; As for mysticism,
James found that it also is marked by an ineffability requiring
direct experience, as well as a noetic quality which carries with
it &quot;a curious sense of authority for aftertime.&quot; Still
another aspect is passivity, in which &quot;the mystic feels as
if he were grasped and held by a superior power.&quot; And a
final factor is transiency. &quot;Mystical states cannot be
sustained for long. Except in rare instances, half an hour, or at
most an hour or two, seems to be the limit.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of those rare exceptions perhaps was Emanuel
Swedenborg, the so-called Swedish Aristotle, who was said to have
had a mystical experience which lasted, more or less
continuously, for almost three decades. LSD cannot match that
record, but it does seem to improve somewhat on the normal time
limits indicated by James. Except for duration, however, there is
obviously a remarkable similarity between James's typology and
psychedelic experience. And just incidentally, James noted that
mystical states are often accompanied by various photisms, or
luminous phenomena, which also are an aspect of psychedelic
experience (for example, Paul's blinding vision and Constantine's
cross in the sky). Finally, let us call attention to James's
observation: &quot;One may say truly, I think, that personal
religious experience has its roots and centre in mystical states
of consciousness.&quot; In other words, we are likening
psychedelic experience not just to mysticism but to religious
experience as a whole. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From this background, then, emerges LSD's first
clear challenge to orthodox theology. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Did the saints owe their visions to some biological
short-circuit which caused them to experience spontaneously what
LSD cultists achieve with a chemical? Can their mystic raptures
be traced to a malfunction of the adrenal glands? Does the
faith-state have a neurological basis? Is the religious
experience as such nothing more than a fluke of body chemistry? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The materialists would like to think so, and do.
Dr. Sidney Cohen (who is no materialist) has suggested that
religious experience may one day be redefined as &quot;a
dys-synchrony of the reticular formation of the brain.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some scholars have pushed even further. Not only do
psychedelics appear to duplicate religious experience, they say.
It is possible that religion itself is psychedelic in origin. One
of the major spokesmen for this viewpoint has been Gordon Wasson,
an authority on the psychedelic mushrooms of Mexico, who has
suggested that primitive men may have stumbled many times upon
innocent-looking plants which produce the same effects as LSD.
These theobotanicals, possibly mushrooms, might well have been a
&quot;mighty springboard&quot; which first put the idea of God
into men's heads. Wasson also has proposed a psychedelic
explanation of the ancient Greek cult that produced the
Eleusinian Mysteries, and he has advanced the idea that Plato's
pure Ideas might be the product of a psychedelic insight. (In
other words, Plato was an acidhead.) Following this line of
reasoning, it might seem logical to conclude that the Eden story
is actually a psychedelic parable&#151;and we would be happy to
propose that theory ourselves had we not already proposed another
theory with an antithetical conclusion. In any case, Wasson goes
on to suggest that psychedelic sacraments in the course of time
may have been replaced by more innocuous hosts, and that they
represent perhaps &quot;the original element in all the Holy
Suppers of the world.&quot; The whole idea, of course, is pure
speculation, and necessarily so, but at the same time it is very
interesting speculation and by no means implausible. It is
particularly tempting to apply Wasson's theory to the metaphysics
of India; according to Masters and Houston, an estimated 90 per
cent of the holy men in that country are currently on hemp and
various other drugs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The point often is made that religious ascetics
traditionally have promoted their mystical states of
consciousness by employing techniques that rival LSD in their
probable impact on biochemical balance. These include fasting,
yogic breathing exercises, sleep deprivation, dervish dances,
self-flagellation, and monastic isolation. Even in the pews of
the pious, religious contemplation may be supported by such
trance-inducing aids as organ music, stained glass windows,
repetitive chants and prayers, incense, and flickering candles. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The question of religious chemistry has been
underscored recently by the wide attention given to the theories,
already mentioned, of Dr. Abram Hoffer and Humphry Osmond. Their
adrenochrome-adrenolutin hypothesis suggests that schizophrenia
may be caused at least in part by defective adrenal metabolism.
Very briefly, the adrenal gland secretes the hormone adrenaline,
which helps coordinate biological mechanisms in emergency
situations&#151;for example, a fist fight or a threatened traffic
accident. Heart rate is increased, the blood is sugared up and
pumped to the necessary muscles. Adrenaline also may affect the
emotions, contributing to anxiety and depression. In the body it
turns into a toxic hormone called adrenochrome, which in turn can
be converted into either of two other compounds: dihydroxyindole
or adrenolutin. It is possible that dihydroxyindole balances off
adrenaline to reduce tension and irritability; in schizophrenics,
however, adrenochrome is converted primarily into adrenolutin,
which also is toxic, and the combination of
adrenochrome-adrenolutin results in a poisonous disruption of the
brain's chemical processes. That is the theory. And the
prescribed antidotes are nicotinic acid (niacin) or nicotinamide
(Vitamin B-3). Discussing one of the villains in the piece, the
scientists write: &quot;There are few who doubt that adrenochrome
is active in animals or in man, and it is now included among the
family of compounds known as hallucinogens&#151;compounds like
mescaline and LSD-2 5 capable of producing psychological changes
in man.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Hoffer-Osmond studies are far from conclusive,
and similar theories have been advanced in the past. But the
studies hold promise, and they are receiving serious
consideration&#151;due in part, no doubt, to the significance
they have in other areas of current debate, including religion.
The line dividing insanity and mysticism has never been too
sharply drawn, and the biochemical theory of schizophrenia makes
it all the more tenuous. Vitamin B-3 actually has cured cases of
schizophrenia, according to Dr. Hoffer and Osmond. But Vitamin
B-3 also has proved effective in terminating LSD experiences, and
the implications of this must be obvious. As we asked earlier:
Are insanity, mysticism, and the psychedelic experience in some
way related? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aldous Huxley has suggested they are. The
experience of absolute reality is awesome enough in small doses,
and the schizophrenic, drugged by his own body chemistry, is like
a man who is permanently under the influence of a psychedelic. He
is &quot;unable to shut off the experience of a reality which he
is not holy enough to live with.&quot; He cannot take refuge,
even for a moment, in &quot;the homemade universe of common
sense&#151;the strictly human world of useful notions, shared
symbols and socially acceptable conventions.&quot; The result is
a bad trip which never ends. But the psychedelic subject knows
that he can and will return to that limited but comforting world,
and he is therefore in a position to accept his experience: to
enjoy it and to learn from it. This in fact appears to be the
main basis for denying that psychedelics produce a model
psychosis. As Dr. Cohen and parapsychologist Gardner Murphy
expressed it: &quot;When the dissolution of the reasoning self
occurs in a chaotic manner, the result is called psychosis. When
the state is not accompanied by panic or anxiety, it is perceived
as mystical, and creative solutions of (or at least an armistice
with) life problems could result.&quot; Dr. Cohen has proposed
that the difference here makes logical a distinction between
insanity and unsanity, which he would place at polar ends of a
continuum; in the middle, somewhere, would lie sanity.
Nevertheless, it is a bit jarring to consider the possibility
that religious experience is an end-product of adrenochrome,
described as a dark crystalline material which can easily be made
in a laboratory. &quot;In its pure form,&quot; write Dr. Hoffer
and Osmond, &quot;it manifests itself as beautiful, sharp,
needle-like crystals which have a brilliant sheen. When the
crystals are powdered, it appears as a bright red powder, which
dissolves quickly in water to form a blood-red solution.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It would be interesting to see if a shot of
vitamins could terminate a spontaneous religious experience. But
what if it did? And what if LSD does in fact initiate such an
experience? Does this mean the experience is simply a
manifestation of the drug? </p>

<h2>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; The sound of one hand clapping</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A spark touches off an explosion. But the explosion
is not simply a product or property of the spark. If one opens a
window and looks at the view, one does not equate the view with
the window; one does not suppose that the window <i>caused</i>
the view. In the same sense, LSD has been described as a chemical
key which opens some window in the mind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Similarly, electric shock may awaken a mental
patient to the &quot;reality&quot; of the common-sense world, but
nobody will say that the common-sense world is a product of the
shock. By the same token, it could be argued that LSD awakens
normal men to a still greater reality&#151;and that it does so by
means of a chemical shock which liberates the mind from ingrained
thought patterns based on verbal abstractions and the
memory-forethought habit. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our normal mode of thinking can be described as
survival-thinking. We see a traffic signal, and we think
&quot;stop&quot; rather than &quot;pretty red light.&quot;
Furthermore, since our mind is designed to act upon things, we
normally limit our perception to those things we wish to act
upon. This is known as attention, a form of consciousness in
which awareness is brought to a sharp but limited focus; we see
what we have to see, and we see it the way we need to see it.
Both abstraction (&quot;stop&quot;) and attention are designed
for action, and so we view the world in terms of our action upon
it. Along these same lines, Huxley described the brain and
nervous system as a &quot;reducing valve&quot; which receives the
flood of sensory input and filters out all that which is not
necessary for action, and therefore for survival; were it not for
this, we could not function in the world as we know it. To
function, we must deceive ourselves as to the actual nature of
reality&#151;a form of adaptation which LSD researcher Willis W.
Harman has termed cultural hypnosis. &quot;We are all hypnotized
from infancy,&quot; wrote Harman, who went on to propose that
this was just another way in which to describe enculturation. We
accept suggestions from the environment&#151;from our parents and
society&#151;and these suggestions shape the manner of our
perception; finally, we perceive things in a state of hypnosis:
not as they are, but as we are told to see them. Thus the child
first sees the traffic signal as a pretty red light, which it is;
but soon he learns to see it another way&#151;as an
abstraction&#151;or else is run down by a truck. And so it must
be. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Genius, however, has been defined as looking at
things in just a slightly different way. Perhaps the truth of the
matter is that genius looks at things more as they actually are:
the genius is not completely hypnotized but only partly so.
Reality is still reality, after all, and it does no harm perhaps
to steal an occasional glance at it, if only to satisfy ourselves
that it still exists. LSD presumably allows us to do this by
breaking the trance; it enables us, in Huxley's term, to become
Mind at Large. The reducing valve is shut down, attention is
scattered, and we are back again in the real world&#151;happy and
helpless. Comparing survival awareness and psychedelic awareness,
Orientalist Alan W. Watts has suggested the analogy of a
spotlight and a floodlight, and the analogy may be an apt one; it
is true that the psychedelic subject often will focus his
attention for long periods upon some object of delight&#151;a
flower, perhaps, or a crack in a wall&#151;but as Watts put it,
this is an unprogrammed mode of attention in which one looks <i>at</i>
things rather than <i>for</i> things: the world is not chopped
into pieces for purposes of action or cause-and-effect analysis.
In any case, LSD from this point of view is simply a
trance-breaking snap of the fingers&#151;and the same applies to
any chemical agent which might be involved in ordinary religious
experience. The chemical does not determine the experience, it
merely permits it. In this connection, we may read a certain
significance into one of the LSD cultist's familiar expressions,
&quot;turned on.&quot; We turn on a radio and hear an orchestra
playing <i>Vienna Bonbons</i>, and of course the music was there
in the room all the time, and the music would be there even if
the radio were not; the radio simply allows us to hear the music.
The comparison is all the more valid if, as indicated earlier,
LSD in fact does quit the brain after triggering its chain of
metabolic processes, and it may be significant in this connection
that some cultists say they have learned to turn on without
drugs. And finally there is an interesting piece of evidence that
has come to us all the way from Japan. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To produce the sudden insight called <i>satori</i>,
many Zen Buddhists in Japan contemplate a
&quot;mind-murdering&quot; form of riddle called the <i>koan</i>.
(What is the sound of one hand clapping? What was your original
face before you were born?) These riddles of course defy logic,
and that is just what they are supposed to do; they are designed
to break down the rational intellect, just as LSD does, and thus
provide the student with a new viewpoint. If asked to explain
ultimate reality, a Zen master might kick a ball&#151;or slap his
pupil in the face. And the idea is that ultimate reality has
nothing to do with words or logic: it is raw existence in the
here and now. <i>Satori</i> is in fact remarkably similar to
psychedelic experience, if not indeed identical, and it is
produced by a form of shock which is neither chemical nor
electrical but intellectual&#151;or at least mental. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still, the non-physical explanations of psychedelic
experience raise many questions. If psychedelics simply awaken a
subject to reality, why does the subject invariably return to his
trance-state after a predictable interval? Why will another
chemical terminate an experience? And what of psychosomatic
medicine? Doesn't it suggest the possibility at least that Zen
Buddhists and self-starting cultists have developed a capacity to
influence their metabolism: that they somehow initiate a
biochemical reaction which in turn initiates their experience?
The issue of chemistry cannot be avoided, it seems; psychedelic
cultists and religionists alike should be prepared to face
squarely the possibility or even probability that their
metaphysical systems are in fact inexorably linked to
biochemistry. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is not a new question; it is one of those very
old questions we referred to earlier. And it revolves around the
musty dispute between the materialists, who say that the soul or
psyche is just an aspect or property of the material body,
nothing more, and the dualistic idealists, who make a clear
distinction between spirit on the one hand and matter on the
other. According to the idealists, the soul merely inhabits the
body, and it survives the body after death. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; William James met the problem head on more than six
decades ago in <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>. He
wrote sardonically: &quot;Medical materialism finishes up Saint
Paul by calling his vision on the road to Damascus a discharging
lesion of the occipital cortex, he being an epileptic.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; James himself had participated in experiments with
nitrous oxide (laughing gas). This turn-of-the-century
psychedelic produced what James referred to as the anesthetic
revelation, and far from convincing him that religion was mere
chemistry, it indicated to James that there were unfathomed
realms of consciousness which &quot;forbid a premature closing of
our accounts with reality.&quot; James scoffed at
&quot;superficial medical talk&quot; about hypnoid states, and he
asserted that medical materialism was &quot;altogether illogical
and inconsistent.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If <i>all</i> states of mind are caused by some
organic condition, then one &quot;could as easily argue that the
liver determines the dicta of the sturdy atheist as decisively as
it does those of the Methodist.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sturdy atheist has yet to answer that, but what
about the Methodist? With its obvious capacity to alter states of
consciousness, LSD might appear to make hash of dualistic
idealism. Even if it does, however, materialism is by no means
the only option that remains. An alternative can be found within
orthodox tradition, and this is the alternative offered by Thomas
Aquinas. One hesitates to speak for a saint, but it does seem
entirely likely that Saint Thomas would have no trouble
reconciling religious conviction with LSD or the
adrenochrome-adrenolutin hypothesis. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dualistic idealism derives from Plato and has been
passed on to us by Saint Augustine and Descartes, among others.
But Thomistic philosophy rejects it and proposes instead the
unitary idealism of Aristotle. This affirms the reality of both
the spiritual and the material, but it does not insist that they
be viewed antagonistically&#151;or indeed as separate entities.
One might as easily distinguish the warmth of the sun from the
sun. Mendelssohn's <i>Violin Concerto in E Minor</i> is no less
beautiful because it issues from catgut and horsehair. One does
not say, &quot;It's merely catgut&quot; or &quot;It's simply
horsehair.&quot; Nor does one listen to Fischer-Dieskau singing
Schubert and say, &quot;It's nothing more than epiglottis, after
all.&quot; In the same sense, the human personality implied for
Saint Thomas a combination of mind and matter, body and soul. He
acknowledged a physiological factor in dreams, moods, insanity.
He did believe that a certain spiritual element survives after
bodily death; but he considered this soul without its body an
insignificant phantom, and he held that human personality, as
opposed to this phantom, is an indivisible union of spirit and
matter. This view has serious implications for personal
immortality, as we shall see later. But it also provides a
framework for a religious interpretation of psychedelic
phenomena. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The supposed necessity for religion to insist upon
a soul-body dichotomy traces back to that original sin of the
I-It mind, dualism. And it also reflects a primitive line of
reasoning which Sir James Frazer described in The Golden Bough:
&quot;As the savage commonly explains the processes of inanimate
nature by supposing that they are produced by living beings
working in or behind the phenomena, so he explains the phenomena
of life itself. If an animal lives and moves, it can only be, he
thinks, because there is a little animal inside which moves it:
if a man lives and moves, it can only be because he has a little
man or animal inside who moves him. The animal inside the animal,
the man inside the man, is the soul.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus the Huron Indians supposed the soul had a head
and body, arms and legs; for the Nootka the soul was a little
fellow who stood erect inside the head, and whenever he fell
over, you lost your senses; for many primitives the soul was a
manikin exactly resembling its possessor, and it was proper to
speak of fat souls and thin souls, or long souls and short souls.
The soul could escape through the natural openings of the body;
the Marquesans therefore would hold the mouth and nose of a dying
person, and the Wakelbura of Australia would stick hot coals in
the ears of a corpse to allow themselves a running start before
the dead man's ghost took after them. The soul also could escape
in sleep and wander about, so the children of Transylvania were
instructed to sleep with their mouths shut, and it was bad form
to awaken anybody suddenly&#151;or worse yet, to move the body of
a sleeper. In Bombay it was tantamount to murder to alter the
appearance of a sleeper, painting a man's face perhaps or adding
mustaches to a slumbering woman. Such notions may well amuse us,
but one might ask how they differ in essence from the basic
assumption of dualistic idealism. That assumption has always been
difficult to defend, and there is perhaps no compelling reason
for us to defend it. The proposition that spirit <i>is</i> a
property of matter has assumed importance only because the
dualists have been so outspoken in their insistence that spirit
is <i>not</i> a property of matter. Once you grant the former
proposition, it loses all its force as an anti-religious
argument. That chorus of &quot;merely&quot; and
&quot;simply&quot; and &quot;nothing more than&quot; becomes
about as meaningful as the &quot;nevermore&quot; which Poe's
raven was trained to repeat. We do not even know, really, what
matter actually <i>is</i>, and as far as Thomism is concerned,
for example, LSD apparently does nothing to destroy the religious
premise&#151;as James defined it. If anything, it strengthens the
premise. From this point of view, it matters not that mystical
experience has a chemical aspect. To say that it is physical as
well as psychical is to say nothing at all. &quot;Of course it
is,&quot; Saint Thomas might well reply. &quot;And what of
that?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, some theologians and scientists alike
regard LSD as a kind of telescope with which to scan the
deep-space regions of the spirit: a discovery which will enable
man to gain a far greater understanding of his religious
instinct. Now mysticism can be produced in the laboratory. It can
be analyzed under experimental conditions with proper controls.
And some have predicted this could lead to an eventual
reconciliation of science and religion: to a science of religions
if not a scientific religion or indeed a religious science. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That could be a bit optimistic, and it might appear
to patronize religion. Considering their contrary viewpoints, it
might be asked whether the rational is suited to study the
instinctive any more than the instinctive is suited to study the
rational. But perhaps there is some hope for an accommodation. As
religions professor G. Ray Jordan, Jr., put it, there is a chance
at least that intensive research with LSD &quot;might do much to
provide empirical proof of a primary beingness in some sense
conscious which is the mystical or intuitive base and perhaps
goal of man's religious aspirations and behavior.&quot; That goes
directly to the heart of the matter: the possibility that there
is such a thing as absolute Being (not to be confused, by the
way, with a Being) and that this gives life its direction and
purpose. Absolute Being in this sense means an ultimate nature,
either realized or potential&#151;as an oak tree has the ultimate
nature of an oak tree (realized), and an acorn has the ultimate
nature of an oak tree (potential). If it could be demonstrated
that absolute Being exists in the universe, this would of course
knock the existentialist props from Sartre's basic proposition.
(Incidentally, it is interesting to note that Sartre once
participated in a mescaline experiment under psychiatric
supervision, and he did not like it at all, as Masters and
Houston report the incident in their excellent study, <i>The
Varieties of Psychedelic Experience</i>. When Simone de Beauvoir
telephoned the hospital to ask how he was doing, Sartre told her
unhappily he was fighting a losing battle with a devilfish. ) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for the common future of science and religion,
there is another possibility, and it was suggested long ago in <i>The
Golden Bough</i>. Sir James considered science a natural
outgrowth of religion, and in fact he traced a line of
development from magic to religion to science. As Sir James saw
it, magic was actually a primitive form of science; it was based
on the assumption that there were immutable laws to the universe
and that man could control them. Thus magicians fearlessly
ordered the gods about, threatening to kill them or bash their
heads if they did not obey. But there was a fatal flaw to magic,
and this lay &quot;not in its general assumption of a sequence of
events, determined by law, but in its total misconception of the
nature of the particular laws.&quot; In the course of time the
wiser magicians realized their spells were not working, and they
concluded the gods must be running the show after all. Thus the
Age of Magic became the Age of Religion; the magicians became
priests, and they prayed to the gods they had sought to command.
The point is that magic preceded religion &quot;and that man
essayed to bend nature to his wishes by the sheer force of spells
and enchantments before he strove to coax and mollify a coy,
capricious, or irascible deity by the soft insinuation of prayer
and sacrifice.&quot; But then man discovered new laws, and these
truly seemed to work; the priests became proud magicians again,
and the Age of Religion became the Age of Science. Sir James
thought this was well and good, as it should be. But he added: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Yet the history of thought should warn us
against concluding that because the scientific theory of the
world is the best that has yet been formulated, it is necessarily
complete and final.... In the last analysis magic, religion, and
science are nothing but theories of thought; and as science has
supplanted its predecessors, so it may hereafter be itself
superseded by some more perfect hypothesis, perhaps by some
totally different way of looking at the phenomena . . . of which
we in this generation can form no idea.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Today's magicians have found perhaps that their
spells do not work quite as they had hoped. Members of the drug
movement in turn may find Sir James's words prophetic, suggesting
that psychedelic insight can supersede both science and religion
as we presently understand them. Certainly the cultists imagine
that they have just the thing Sir James indicated might be
necessary: a totally different way of looking at phenomena. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Curiously perhaps, scientists have seemed somewhat
more receptive to the idea than have religionists. Among the
latter, there are those who deny that psychedelics offer any
insight into the actual nature of deity or cosmos. </p>

<h2>5. The god of the East</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Toward the middle of the last century the poet
Charles Baudelaire became a member of the famed Club des
Haschischins in Paris. He was initiated into the mysteries of
hashish, one of the derivatives of psychedelic hemp, and he later
wrote of the drug in something less than glowing terms.
Baudelaire declared that the &quot;accursed sweetmeat&quot;
resulted in &quot;an appalling thing, the marriage of a man to
himself.&quot; It led to &quot;the individual's belief in his own
god-head.&quot; In short, it made a man feel he <i>was</i> God. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A similar objection to the psychedelic experience
was lodged more than a hundred years later by Professor R. C.
Zaehner of Oxford, an authority on Eastern religions and a Roman
Catholic. Zaehner set himself the task of replying to Huxley's
enthusiastic claims for mescaline, and to play fair the professor
took mescaline himself. &quot;I disliked the experience,&quot; he
reported, and what especially displeased him, as he put it, was
the fact of losing control of oneself. &quot;My conscious
resistance to the drug was, indeed, very strong.&quot; That was
not a very propitious set, as the cultists say, and as a
consequence no doubt Zaehner's experience was limited to a sort
of silly jag which often occurs in the early stages of a complete
experience. Everything seemed utterly ridiculous and totally
funny, and Zaehner laughed himself to tears. He described <i>The
Golden Bough</i> as one of the great comic classics, and he said
the trouble with Jung was &quot;he doesn't realize how dull his
collective unconscious is.&quot; Cultists believe this period of
cosmic laughter reflects a first dawning of the awareness that
words and normal perception patterns are both artificial and
inadequate. In any case, Zaehner never went beyond it, and even
in his most mirthful moments, he said, he managed to distinguish
between funny and sacred objects. Shown a reproduction of a
praying figure in a nativity scene by Piero della Francesca, he
remarked that this was &quot;a holy thing not to be looked at
when you're drugged.&quot; Later he evaluated the experience as
in a sense anti-religious&#151;not conformable with religious
experience or in the same category&#151; and he reported with
some pride that his normal religious consciousness &quot;was
never completely swamped.&quot; Zaehner's book, <i>Mysticism,
Sacred and Profane</i>, is so far the most authoritative attack
upon psychedelics from the viewpoint of orthodox religion, and in
it the professor denies the idea that drugs might give rise to a
genuine state of mystical consciousness. Zaehner concedes that
psychedelics might promote what he terms natural mysticism and
monistic mysticism, in which the subject feels a sense of union
either with nature or with some impersonal Absolute; but they do
not promote <i>Theistic mysticism</i>, in which the subject
encounters the transcendent, personal God of Judaism and
Christianity. That at least is Zaehner's opinion, to which he
adds: &quot;In the case of Huxley, as in that of the maniac, the
personality seems to be dissipated into the objective world,
while in the case of theistic mystics the human personality is
wholly absorbed into the Deity, who is felt and experienced as
being something totally distinct and other than the objective
world.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Theistic mysticism, Zaehner explains, the
subject is conscious only of God and loses his awareness of all
other things. In Huxley's brand of mysticism, one identifies
himself with the external world&#151;to the apparent exclusion of
God. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From his own point of view, Zaehner may be right.
But there is reason to dispute even his basic premise&#151;that
psychedelic drugs cannot promote Theistic mysticism&#151;and his
statements in any case are somewhat confusing if not confused.
The Zaehner test for authenticity does not compare the
psychedelic experience to mysticism as such. It compares it to
Western mysticism. And that is just the point. There also is
Eastern mysticism, which is older even than Western mysticism,
and in fact it is just here that the drug movement offers its
second major challenge to orthodox theology. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Zaehner to the contrary, Westerners under the
influence of psychedelics very often have reported overwhelming
awareness of a transcendent God; on the other hand, they also
have reported the experience of alien concepts which frankly
astonished&#151;or even terrified&#151;them, and these by and
large have been the concepts of Eastern mysticism. Within the
drug movement, moreover, it seems fair to say that the tendency
has been toward the latter type of experience. There are
subjective factors which may help to account for this tendency,
and we shall discuss them later. But for the moment we can say
that psychedelic experience on the whole frequently appears to
validate Eastern ideas about God, man, and the universe. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This of course is a very broad statement and
possibly a very hazardous one; it assumes that it is possible to
speak of Eastern ideas as such, as if these constituted a
monolithic system of belief. The fact is otherwise, it scarcely
needs to be said, and in one sense it is just as misleading to
speak of Eastern religion as it is to speak of Western religion,
thus bedding down together the Unitarian, the Roman Catholic, and
the Seventh-day Adventist. It is not even proper to speak in
general terms of Hinduism as such, or Buddhism as such, or even
Hinyana Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism as such. Each is a major
system which contains various levels of sophistication and paths
to the truth; in India, for example, you will find one Hindu
worshiping a whole pantheon of Gods (330 million, according to
one count, including the elephant-headed Gunputty), while another
Hindu contemplates a metaphysical abstraction: you will find one
Hindu who denies the world and another Hindu who is totally
involved in the world. As you delve into Eastern thought you
reach a level of interpretation which seems to correspond with at
least some elements in Western thought; at a still deeper level
it becomes almost impossible to say anything positive at all. But
we shall call attention to some of these finer points, and
meanwhile the fact remains that there is <i>something</i> the
Westerner refers to mentally when he uses that term, Eastern
ideas. Perhaps in what follows it might be more correct to say
that we are describing Eastern ideas as they are generally viewed
in the West, from a more or less superficial point of view, and
that for the most part (in this chapter) we are describing the
ideas of India rather than those of China or Japan: that is to
say, we are talking more about Hinduism than Buddhism, and a
rather rudimentary Hinduism at that. Within such a context, then,
riding roughshod over nuances, it might be said that psychedelic
experience is Eastern in so far as it appears to validate
immanence rather than transcendence, monism rather than
pluralism, reincarnation rather than resurrection, nirvana rather
than heaven, maya rather than hell, ignorance rather than evil,
liberation rather than salvation, and self-knowledge rather than
grace, redemption, or atonement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As applied to the concept of God, transcendence
refers to a form of deity whose nature is wholly different from
man's. Theistic transcendence implies a wholly-other God who is
some sort of supreme Person, in the sense at least that he can
and does enter into a personal relationship with man. In strict
transcendence, God and man are no more the same person than a
master and his servant are the same person. In immanence, on the
other hand, men partake of God's nature; God dwells in men, and
they are in fact a part of God. The concept of immanence as such
is perfectly acceptable from the viewpoint of Western Theism, so
long as it does not deny altogether the element of transcendence.
Thus it is fine to say that in God we live and move and have our
being, in the orthodox interpretation of that phrase, just so we
do not develop some fancy notion that we <i>are</i> him. The
relationship in this case is crudely that of a father and son
perhaps, as opposed to that of a master and his servant. But in
pure immanence, or pantheism, God's nature and man's nature are
identical. God is just another word for mankind as a whole, or
the universe as a whole, or reality as a whole, or the life force
as a whole. In pantheism it is neither insanity nor heresy to
imagine you are God, because in fact you are God. Western
theology on the whole has tended to emphasize the transcendent
aspect of God&#151;certainly so at least in comparison to Eastern
theology, which has tended to emphasize the immanent aspect of
God. In Asia, moreover, the emphasis has been given to pure
immanence or pantheism, and God in any case is not conceived from
a Theistic viewpoint as in any sense a person or being who dwells
apart. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Consider next the doctrines of monism and
pluralism. Pluralism insists upon the integrity of the individual
soul, self, or ego. In monism, the individual personality has no
lasting reality. It is a passing phenomenon, illusory in nature,
and, in the end, all of the individual selves will be absorbed
again into the godhead: into the One, the Whole, the Absolute,
like drops of water in a termless sea. The godhead perhaps has
temporarily divided itself for some practical purpose, as the
hand is divided into five fingers; or more likely the godhead is
simply amusing itself, making all the world a stage on which it
acts out the various roles&#151;a method of killing eternity, as
it were. In Hinduism, this monistic Absolute is known variously
as Atman or Brahman, and all individual selves are but aspects of
Atman or the supreme Self. A Hindu holy man contemplates the
sacred syllable OM, emblematic of the Atman godhead, and he asks,
&quot;What is that?&quot; He is told, &quot;Thou art that.&quot;
Thus the wise Hindu is never jealous, for of whom should he be
jealous? He sees no other, hears no other, knows no other, for
what other is there to see, hear, or know? He hates no living
creature&#151;not even the tiger&#151;for he knows that all
creatures are simply food: are born from food, live upon food,
and then become food. As the hissing Hamadryad in <i>Mary Poppins</i>
put it: &quot;It may be that to eat and be eaten are the same
thing in the end.... Bird and beast and stone and star&#151;we
are all one, all one.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As cream in butter, as salt in the sea, Atman is in
everything and is everything. Atman is like a flame which assumes
the shape of each object it consumes. As the air in a jar is
nevertheless the same as the air outside the jar, although it
takes the shape of the jar, so the Self in every self is
nevertheless Atman. And the wise Hindu knows this. He knows that
he himself is the youth, the maiden, the old man bent upon his
staff, the dark butterfly, the green parrot with red eyes, the
thundercloud, seasons, and seas. Buddhists, in reverence, refuse
to limit reality even to a universal Self, and thus they never
speak of Atman. They speak instead of the Void or of the Clear
Light of the Void. But the Void is not a void in the Western
sense; the expression is a <i>via negativa</i> which seeks to
avoid the trap of language, because there are no words&#151;even
Atman&#151;to describe that which is beyond all words and beyond
all determinations. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But call it Atman or call it the Void,
enlightenment comes when the individual self realizes it has no
separate identity beyond this Absolute. Such liberating awareness
is referred to as <i>moksha</i> by Hindus and <i>satori</i> by
Zen Buddhists, and with it comes that perfect peace in which the
individual self achieves nirvana and is absorbed into the
Absolute. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the Theistic mysticism of the West, strictly
speaking the soul is not absorbed by the Absolute, or by God.
Rather, the soul and God retain their distinctive identities, and
their relationship is one of love. Love is the key word that
distinguishes Theistic mysticism from Eastern mysticism; it
implies a relationship between two separate entities, and it
therefore preserves both the transcendent nature of God and the
everlasting integrity of the individual human soul. The soul is
not sucked up by the Absolute as water is sucked up by a sponge;
the soul relates to the godhead in an act of love, and the soul
in fact may be referred to, in this relationship, as the Bride of
Christ. As Buber expressed it in terms of his I-Thou
relationship, I-Thou necessarily implies both an I and a Thou; I
is not Thou and Thou is not I, but I and Thou are united in love:
hence the significance of that hyphen. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the Asian doctrine of absorption, of course, the
achievement of nirvana can mean different things, depending upon
the interpretation. It can mean an actual release from the world,
physically and psychically, or simply a new state of
consciousness in which one is no longer deceived by his intellect
and therefore views the world as it actually is, beyond language
and appearances. But nirvana commonly has been associated with
the former interpretation, and this leads directly to the Asian
concept of reincarnation&#151;as opposed to resurrection.
Resurrection was an Egyptian idea; it supposes that man has but
one life upon the earth and thus only one chance to win his just
and lasting reward, whatever that might be. On the judgment day
of Western theology, the soul will be reunited with its body to
find eternal life in a pluralistic heaven. Saint Thomas among
others found it necessary to insist upon resurrection; with his
rejection of dualistic idealism, it seemed the only way to
provide for the personal immortality of the individual soul, and
this point was the main basis for Thomas' famous quarrel with
Averroism. Averroes had denied the possibility of personal
immortality and had proposed instead the theory of monopsychism:
the idea that mankind as a whole has a single mind in which all
individuals participate. It is said that Thomas considered
personal immortality the most important issue of the thirteenth
century; he defended it vigorously, and Averroism was
anathematized by the bishop of Paris in 1270. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But resurrection and the permanence of the
individual soul also are denied by the East. In the alternative
doctrine of reincarnation, the separate self does not really
exist, and it is only the realization of this fact which permits
the achievement of nirvana. But realization is difficult&#151;far
more difficult than good works or avoiding sin. So a man is given
not one life in which to achieve it, but many lives. The soul
passes from body to body in a cycle of death and rebirth, as a
leech proceeds from one blade of grass to the next, and each life
offers a fresh opportunity to make the great discovery in which
one recognizes at last the nature of the Grand Illusion. With the
discovery comes the death of the individual personality, which
never was, and absorption into the monistic Absolute or the
everlasting peace of nirvana. This doctrine also has been
interpreted symbolically as a poetic expression of the many
stages that one man passes through in one lifetime, just as
nirvana has been interpreted to mean a state of awareness rather
than literal absorption into nirvana which leaves the earth
behind. But the goal in any case bears no similarity to the
phenomenal heaven of the West. State of mind or state of Being,
it is not a place, and the individual personality is not an
aspect of it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the same sense, there is no Eastern equivalent
to the Western hell. If there is a hell, it is the world itself,
or at least the deceiving world of appearances&#151;the
phenomenal illusion which is known as <i>maya</i> or <i>sangsara</i>.
A man lives in hell when he fails to recognize reality. He lives
in hell when he denies his own true nature and is therefore
tormented by lust and desire. It is his mistaken sense of
individuality which causes all of his pleasure and all of his
pain, and there is far more pain than pleasure. He is a victim of
dualism, hopelessly enmeshed in <i>meum et thrum</i>. Because he
imagines that there is an other, he envies or desires the other.
Because he imagines that his little self is his real Self, he
weeps at the thought of his own mortality &#151;for he knows full
well that the little self is finite and that one day it must
perish forever. But with enlightenment comes peace, serenity, and
release from this hell. The wise man knows that there is no
other, so he does not envy or desire the other; he is free from
craving. The wise man knows that there is no little self, so he
does not weep for his own mortality; he knows that there is only
Atman or the Void, there is only the One, and he is that One, and
therefore he is in fact immortal and can never perish. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It also follows, from the Eastern viewpoint, that
evil deeds are a product of ignorance. Evil in the Western sense
is just one more example of dualistic perception. It suggests
there is a very real, if negative, force which causes man to sin
against the light. But ask the Western moralist what would happen
if a potential murderer were somehow spirited away to a tropical
island and left there alone. This would-be killer would have
nobody to kill, and so of course he would not kill anybody. On
judgment day, shall he be judged a murderer or not? The problem
is easily resolved in the East, where all men in a manner of
speaking are stranded upon that island. It is impossible to kill
anybody else, because nowhere in the universe is there anybody
else. There is no other, except as imagined. In doing harm to
what he supposes is another person, therefore, a man does harm
only to himself. Homicide is impossible; there can only be
partial suicides. And so it is, according to the doctrine of <i>maya</i>,
that men do wrong through ignorance. They sin against others, and
thereby against themselves, because they are deluded as to their
true nature&#151;because they fail to understand that they and
their fellows are but elements of a monistic whole. Thus
knowledge is the path to righteousness, and he who has knowledge
will never sin. Thus the goal of wisdom is liberation from <i>maya</i>.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It follows that Eastern liberation is not the same
as Western salvation. The Westerner must work for his own
salvation, but ultimately it comes to him only through the love
and mercy of God. In an act of grace, the transcendent deity may
bestow his gifts upon some erring soul. For Christians, man's
redemption was secured by the sacrifice on the cross, a direct
intervention of the supernatural power on behalf of mankind. But
in the East there is no supernatural power to intervene. There is
no forgiveness, for there is no God who is able to forgive. The
burden of liberation falls entirely upon the individual, who must
lift that burden himself; he cannot pray that it be lifted from
him. He must strive for liberation through self-knowledge, and in
doing so he is helped or hindered by his karma&#151;the sum total
of a man's thoughts and actions during his lifetime or his
lifetimes. He will be helped if it is good karma, hindered if it
is bad karma. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bad karma might seem at first to correspond with
Western guilt, but it does not really. Guilt implies that sinful
action is provoked by the active powers of darkness&#151;by the
force called evil&#151;and that free-willed man has perversely
chosen darkness over light. A clear-cut choice and the freedom to
choose are basic assumptions in the doctrine of guilt,-and the
whole idea is foreign to Eastern thinking. There may be a choice,
but there is nothing clear-cut about it. It is obscured by maya,
which prevents a man from seeing it. If he could see it, there is
no question what his action would be; he would do the right thing
without a moment's hesitation, because the right thing is simply
the logical thing: it is the selfish, or if you will the Selfish,
course to follow. Bad karma arises from ignorance, not
perversity. It has been equated with cause-and-effect and with
heredity. One remains a prisoner in the Net of Illusion because
one has not been thinking the right thoughts&#151;has not gained
the proper knowledge, in other words&#151;and heredity is another
way of saying that karma follows you from one generation to the
next, or from one reincarnation to the next. Evangelists such as
Billy Graham have complained bitterly that people no longer
believe in guilt, and Saint Augustine in his time felt called
upon to condemn a similar trend. In the latter case, the false
prophet was the astrologer, who suggested that a man's faults lay
in his stars, while the tempter's voice today belongs to Freud.
And perhaps America at least is moving toward an Eastern view of
sin. It has been said that an American takes delight in his
analysis, talks about it freely, and has a penchant even to boast
about it, while a European is still ashamed of his libido and
would not dream of discussing it in public. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the world as illusion does not sit very well
with traditional American concepts, and some would view this idea
as a greater threat to our values than pantheism, monism, or any
of the other Eastern isms. It seems to assert that life itself is
a curse, and indeed the Hindu speaks of life as a terrible wheel
of death and rebirth; reincarnation in his eyes is a curse, and a
new birth is something to be avoided at any cost. This might be
taken as a direct challenge to the Christian doctrine that being
as being is good <i>(esse qua esse bottom est),</i> and, as
mentioned, some elements within the drug movement seem to have
found it an attractive idea. Moreover, it could be argued that
modern physics supports the basic proposition with its formula
that energy equals mass times the velocity of light squared
(E=MC2)&#151;suggesting that matter after all is not the solid,
substantial stuff we had supposed it to be. Nor is this just
another idea of some woolly-headed philosopher; it is an idea
that blew up Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These various ideas represent the religious
tradition of half the world. Insofar as it confirms them,
therefore, the psychedelic experience cannot be dismissed as
non-religious on the grounds laid down by Zaehner and Baudelaire,
who really meant that it is non-Western. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seems fair to say, moreover, that most drug
cultists <i>do</i> interpret the LSD experience as a confirmation
of Eastern metaphysics. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Timothy Leary, the high priest of LSD, has often
appeared a bit vague on this point in his public statements.
While he expresses himself for the most part in Hindu and
Buddhist terminology, he tends to speak of the experience simply
as &quot;religious&quot; in nature&#151;suggesting that the
religions of the East and West are fundamentally the same.
Shortly after he founded his League for Spiritual Discovery,
however, I asked Leary if there are not in fact certain basic
differences between the Eastern and Western views. He agreed that
there certainly are. I then asked him whether he thought LSD
experience supports the pantheistic Eastern God or the
transcendent Western God. And he told me there is no question
about it&#151;the experience supports the Eastern God, not the
Western. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even so, is it necessary to regard Eastern thinking
merely as threat and challenge? As we have already indicated,
many of the Eastern concepts are subject to different levels of
interpretation&#151;and some of them at least, at certain levels,
may be entirely compatible with Western trends of thought.
Furthermore, we might demonstrate that these Eastern ideas are
not so foreign to the West as they may seem. </p>

<h2>6. The dome of many-colored glass</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>&quot;The Malay has been a fearful enemy for
months,&quot;</i> Thomas De Quincey wrote in May 1818. <i>&quot;I
have been every night, through his means, transported into
Asiatic scenes.&quot;</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The entry is contained in the famous drug addict's
autobiographical account, <i>Confessions of an English Opium
Eater</i>. The passage which follows describes the Eastern
nightmares produced by the Eastern drug, and it is worth quoting
at length: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I know not whether others share in my feelings on this
    point; but I have often thought that if I were compelled to
    forego England, and to live in China . . . I should go mad.
    The causes of my horror lie deep; and some of them must be
    common to others. Southern Asia, in general, is the seat of
    awful images and associations. As the cradle of the human
    race, it would alone have a dim and reverential feeling
    connected with it. But there are other reasons. No man can
    pretend that the wild, barbarous, and capricious
    superstitions of Africa, or of savage tribes elsewhere,
    affect him in the way that he is affected by the ancient,
    monumental, cruel and elaborate religions of Indostan, etc.
    The mere antiquity of Asiatic things, of their institutions,
    histories, modes of faith, etc., is so impressive, that to me
    the vast age of the race and name overpowers the sense of
    youth in the individual. A young Chinese seems to me an
    antediluvian man renewed . . . nor can any man fail to be
    awed by the names of the Ganges, or the Euphrates. It
    contributes much to these feelings, that southern Asia is,
    and has been for thousands of years, the part of the earth
    most swarming with human life; the great <i>officina gentian</i>
    Man is a weed in these regions. The vast empires also, into
    which the enormous population of Asia has always been cast,
    give a further sublimity to the feelings associated with all
    Oriental names or images. In China, over and above what it
    has in common with the rest of southern Asia, I am terrified
    by the modes of life, by the manners, and the barrier of
    utter abhorrence, and want of sympathy, placed between us by
    feelings deeper than I can analyze. I could sooner live with
    lunatics, or brute animals. All this, and much more than I
    can say, or have time to say, the reader must enter into,
    before he can comprehend the unimaginable horror which these
    dreams of Oriental imagery, and mythological tortures,
    impressed upon me. Under the connecting feeling of tropical
    heat and vertical sunlights, I brought together all
    creatures, birds, beasts, reptiles, all trees and plants,
    usages and appearances, that are found in all tropical
    regions and assembled them together in China or Indostan.
    From kindred feelings, I soon brought Egypt and all her gods
    under the same law. I was stared at, hooted at, grinned at,
    chattered at, by monkeys, by paroquets, by cockatoos. I ran
    into pagodas: and was fixed, for centuries, at the summit, or
    in secret rooms.... I fled from the wrath of Brahma through
    all the forests of Asia. Vishnu hated me: Seeva laid wait for
    me. I came suddenly upon Isis and Osiris: I had done a deed,
    they said, which the ibis and crocodile trembled at. I was
    buried, for a thousand years, in stone coffins, with mummies
    and sphinxes, in narrow chambers at the heart of eternal
    pyramids. I was kissed, with cancerous kisses, by crocodiles;
    and laid, confounded with all unutterable slimy things,
    amongst reeds and Nilotic mud. I thus give the reader some
    slight abstraction of my Oriental dreams, which always filled
    me with such amazement at the monstrous scenery, that horror
    seemed absorbed, for a while, in sheer astonishment. Sooner
    or later came a reflux of feeling that swallowed up the
    astonishment, and left me, not so much in terror, as in
    hatred and abomination of what I saw. Over every form, and
    threat, and punishment, and dim sightless incarceration,
    brooded a sense of eternity and infinity that drove me into
    an oppression as of madness. . . . [And] many times the very
    same dream was broken up in the very same way: I heard gentle
    voices speaking to me . . . and instantly I awoke: it was
    broad noon; and my children were standing, hand in hand, at
    my bedside; come to show me their colored shoes, or new
    frocks, or to let me see them dressed for going out. I
    protest that so awful was the transition from the damned
    crocodile, and the other unutterable monsters and abortions
    of my dreams, to the sight of innocent <i>human</i> natures
    and of infancy, that, in the mighty and sudden revulsion of
    mind, I wept, and could not forbear it, as I kissed their
    faces. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; De Quincey's attitude might well reflect English
provincialism at its best, or worst, but surely he was correct in
assuming that some of the causes of his horror are shared by
others. Undoubtedly he has summed up very well the reaction of
the average Westerner to that nebulous something we have referred
to as Eastern ideas. A similar attitude was expressed, for
example, by Grecophile Edith Hamilton in her comparison of Greek
and Eastern art. The Greeks, she wrote, were the first
Westerners, introducing into the ancient world something
completely new: the rule of reason and the supremacy of the
rational intellect. The Greeks loved order, they loved life, and
they embraced with joy the beauty of the visible world. They were
the first people to play, and their games were conducted on a
grand scale. But this point of view was unique; it did not belong
&quot;to the immense expanse and the multitudinous populations of
the East.&quot; With its oppressed masses and its wretched
conditions of life, the East was preoccupied with the
unseen&#151;and with death. So insecure and unbearable was the
visible world that men could find hope only by rejecting outside
fact and turning inward to the invisible world of spirit and
intuition. Thus a tomb in Egypt and a theater in Greece.
&quot;The one comes to the mind as naturally as the other.&quot;
Thus a grotesquely stylized Hindu bronze of Shiva, its many arms
and hands curving outward&#151;and the Olympic Hermes, &quot;a
perfectly beautiful human being, no more, no less.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When Egypt ended, the East went on ever farther in the
    direction Egypt had pointed. The miseries of Asia are a
    fearful page in history. Her people found strength to endure
    by denying any meaning and any importance to what they could
    not escape. The Egyptian world where dead men walked and
    slept and feasted was transmuted into what had always been
    implicit in its symbolism, the world of the spirit. In India,
    for centuries the leader of thought to the East, ages long
    since, the world of the reason and the world of the spirit
    were divorced and the universe handed over to the latter....
    The mystical artist always sees patterns. The symbol, never
    quite real, tends to be expressed less and less
    realistically, and as the reality becomes abstracted the
    pattern comes forward. The wings on Blake's angels do not
    look like real wings, nor are they there because wings belong
    to angels. They have been flattened, stylized, to provide a
    curving pointed frame, the setting required by the pattern of
    the composition. In Hindoo art and its branches, stylization
    reaches its height. Human figures are stylized far beyond the
    point of becoming a type; they too are made into patterns,
    schematic designs of the human body, an abstraction of
    humanity. In the case of an Eastern rug all desire to express
    any semblance of reality has gone. Such a work of art is pure
    decoration. It is the expression of the artist's final
    withdrawal from the visible world, essentially his denial of
    the intellect.... Again, the gigantic temples of Egypt, those
    massive immensities of granite which look as if only the
    power that moves in the earthquake were mighty enough to
    bring them into existence, are something other than the
    creation of geometry balanced by beauty. The science and the
    spirit are there, but what is there most of all is force,
    inhuman force, calm but tremendous, overwhelming. It reduces
    to nothingness all that belongs to man. He is annihilated....
    The Greek temple [on the other hand] is the perfect
    expression of the pure intellect illumined by the spirit. No
    other great buildings anywhere approach its simplicity....
    Majestic but human, truly Greek. No superhuman force as in
    Egypt; no strange supernatural shapes as in India; the
    Parthenon is the home of humanity at ease, calm, ordered,
    sure of itself and the world. The Greeks flung a challenge to
    nature in the fullness of their joyous strength. They set
    their temples on the summit of a hill overlooking the wide
    sea, outlined against the circle of the sky.... To the Greek
    architect man was the master of the world. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In so far as it remains Greek, and therefore
rational, the Western mind no doubt abhors Oriental images and
the metaphysical concepts they might seem to imply. Indeed, many
Occidentals have emerged from a psychedelic experience with the
same sense of horror and relief De Quincey felt when he awakened
from his opium-haunted dreams to find himself safe again in
merry, common-sense England. As we have already suggested,
however, those images and concepts are not as remote as they may
appear. They are and always have been an aspect of Western
tradition, as counterpoint if nothing more, and it would probably
be possible to demonstrate their influence in almost every phase
of Western history. We have no intention of doing so. The task is
beyond us and would serve no useful purpose here; without any
attempt at comprehensiveness, however, we shall try to show how
this or that thread of Eastern thought has appeared from time to
time in the Western fabric. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The earliest of the threads can be picked up in
Greece itself. It was Heraclitus who observed that no man can
step twice into the same stream. The phenomenal universe is not
the secure and dependable piece of real estate our senses
suggest; on the contrary, it is in a constant state of flux and
chaos. Nothing stays the same. The only thing that never changes,
said Heraclitus, is the fact that everything is changing. Thus
the visible world of the West was called into question from the
very beginning, and philosophical attempts to refute Heraclitus
led in turn to the hypothesis of an invisible realm beyond the
senses. Parmenides, for example, proposed that reality consisted
of pure Being: an eternal One, never changing, which had no
describable qualities whatever, except for the fact that it
existed&#151;and since existence in this sense did not change,
what then of that phenomal world where everything changed?
Obviously, it did not really exist. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then came Plato with his eternal Essences or Ideas,
which Gordon Wasson has suggested were psychedelic in origin.
&quot;The eye and the ear and the other senses are full of
deception,&quot; said Plato. The soul is a helpless prisoner of
the body. It is &quot;simply fastened and glued to the
body.&quot; Or so it was until philosophy came to its rescue.
Referring to the soul in the feminine gender, Plato said that
philosophy advised her to abstain from all use of the senses
&quot;and be gathered up and collected into herself, bidding her
trust in herself and her own pure apprehension of pure existence,
and to mistrust whatever comes to her through other channels and
is subject to variation; for such things are visible and
tangible, but what she sees in her own nature is intelligible and
invisible.&quot; The soul is &quot;dragged by the body into the
region of the changeable, and wanders and is confused; the world
spins round her, and she is like a drunkard, when she touches
change.... But when returning into herself she reflects, then she
passes into the other world, the region of purity, and eternity,
and immortality, and unchangeableness, which are her kindred, and
with them she ever lives.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Platonism evolved into the Neo-Platonism expounded
by Plotinus, who preached a doctrine of mystical union with the
Absolute. Both Platonism and Neo-Platonism in turn were
assimilated by Christianity, and in fact they provided the
metaphysical roots of the early church. This was due largely to
the enormous influence of Saint Augustine, who was a
Neo-Platonist before he became a Christian. Plato's pure Ideas
were interpreted to be the thoughts of God, and as such Platonic
philosophy continued as the mainstay of Roman Catholicism until
the rediscovery of Aristotle in the thirteenth century. Saint
Thomas became the most articulate spokesman for this revived
school of thought, arguing the case for intellect, reason, and
the interdependence of the spiritual and the material. And so it
was that Platonism gave way at last to Aristotelianism, mysticism
to empiricism, and Augustinianism to Thomism. Thomism in essence
was officially adopted by the Roman Catholic Church. But the
break really was not all that sharp, even within the church, and
Platonism has continued to be a major influence in Western
theology and philosophy. Today's drug movement might even be
described as a sort of Neo-Platonist revival. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The point is that Plato was talking Net of Illusion
talk and that this so-called Eastern idea is entirely within the
Western tradition&#151;the idea that the phenomenal world does
not really exist; or the idea that our truncated senses cannot
perceive ultimate reality; or the idea that our intellect
deceives us. Take Berkeley, take Hume. Take almost any Western
philosopher you would care to name. Take modern physics, for that
matter. It seems clear that the West mistrusts the visible world
just as much as the East does, and always has. The only real
issue has been, in James's terminology: Does some unseen order
lie beyond that visible world, and should we seek to adjust
thereto? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Platonism also contains other Oriental threads.
Plato, too, spoke of a morality based wholly on knowledge. He
spoke of reincarnation and of concepts equivalent to nirvana and
karma. For example, Socrates in the <i>Phaedo</i> is discussing
the fate of the soul after death: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>That soul, I say, herself invisible, departs to the
    invisible world&#151;to the divine and immortal and rational:
    thither arriving, she is secure of bliss and is released from
    the error and folly of men, their fears and wild passions and
    all other human ills, and forever dwells, as they say of the
    initiated, in company with the gods.... But the soul which
    has been polluted, and is impure at the time of her
    departure, and is the companion and servant of the body
    always, and is in love with and fascinated by the body . . .
    do you suppose that such a soul will depart pure and
    unalloyed? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such souls are held fast by the corporeal. They
haunt sepulchres and tombs. They </p>

<blockquote>

    they may be supposed to find their prisons in the same

    drunkenness, and have had no thought of avoiding them, would

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If the Greeks worshipped Apollo, god of reason,
they were devoted also to Dionysus, the wine-drunk god of
instinct and mysticism. The cult of the Eleusinian Mysteries paid
homage to Dionysus, and it is believed the Mysteries included a
theory of reincarnation. The possibility that the cult utilized
some sort of psychedelic host would appear to gain considerable
support from a Plutarch fragment, quoted by Edith Hamilton, which
is thought to describe the Eleusinian initiation rites:
&quot;When a man dies he is like those who are initiated into the
Mysteries. Our whole life is a journey by tortuous ways without
outlet. At the moment of quitting it come terrors, shuddering
fear, amazement. Then a light that moves to meet you, pure
meadows that receive you, songs and dances and holy
apparitions.&quot; As we shall see later, this passage suggests a
remarkable parallel between the Mysteries and the contemporary
drug movement's esoteric interpretation of the <i>Tibetan Book of
the Dead</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reincarnation also was entertained as a doctrine by
some of those Gnostic sects that flourished during the first
three centuries of Christianity. The sects were Platonist in that
they took a very negative view of existence in the world of
appearances, and they taught that release could be obtained
through a secret <i>gnosis</i> or knowledge of the divine order.
They also assumed Plato's concept of the Demiurge&#151;an
imperfect creator god who made the earth, as opposed to the
supreme and perfect god who exists as pure Being. They made of
the Demiurge an evil, fallen deity who was responsible for the
creation of matter and hence for the curse of phenomenal
existence, for the fall from pure Being, for the Net of Illusion.
The sects were a curious hodgepodge of Christian dogma, magic,
and Eastern metaphysics. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Christianity had to absorb Gnosticism, just as it
had to absorb Neo-Platonism, and the early church was plagued in
addition by a whole spectrum of Asian-flavored heresies: for
example, the Albigenses, the Bogomiles, the Paulicians. These
sects adulterated their Christianity with strong doses of Eastern
idealism, including the concept of the Demiurge and a hatred of
matter. Similarly, Judaism had come under the dualistic influence
of Zoroastrianism during the Babylonian Captivity. The precise
extent of the East's impact upon the development of Judaism and
Christianity is impossible to measure at this point in history;
indeed, there is an equally frustrated body of scholarship which
has attempted to demonstrate a Western impact upon Eastern
religions during some period in the misty past. But there clearly
was some East-to-West metaphysical commerce, and this has led to
some rather airy speculation that the Bible contains an esoteric
teaching along Eastern lines. Much is made of the fact that Jesus
spoke in parables, and it is suggested that these perhaps were
Oriental abstractions presented in parabolic style for the
benefit of his unsophisticated flock. The people were not ready
for meat, so he fed them milk. &quot;And with many such parables
spoke he the word unto them [the multitudes], as they were able
to hear it. But without a parable spoke he not to them: and when
they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hidden meaning is thus read into many preachments.
&quot;The kingdom of God cometh not with observation.&quot; (The
senses are trapped in the Net of Illusion.) &quot;Neither shall
they say, Lo here! or, lo there? for, behold, the kingdom of God
is within you.&quot; (You are God.) &quot;Inasmuch as ye have
done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done
it unto me.&quot; (We are a monistic One. ) &quot;Love thy
neighbor as thyself.&quot; (You and your neighbor are the same
person.) &quot;Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?&quot;
(We are all the same person.) &quot;If any man will come after
me, let him deny himself.... For whosoever will save his life
shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall
find it.&quot; (You must obliterate the ego to recognize your
true Self.) &quot;God is able of these stones to raise up
children unto Abraham.&quot; (God is immanent in matter. )
&quot;A good man out of the treasure of the heart bringeth forth
good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth
forth evil things.&quot; (Karma.) And so on. Small wonder, then,
that no man dared ask Jesus any question after he declared,
&quot;Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.&quot; And the
&quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot; of the Old Testament is obviously a
Zen statement of pure experience. If nothing else, such
conjecture indicates that truly great thoughts are like the
commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution: they can be interpreted
to meet any need in any period. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The thread of pantheism can be picked up again in
the monopsychism of Averroes, the Great Commentator who was
largely responsible for reintroducing Aristotle to the Western
world. His theories fell short of pure pantheism, perhaps, for
they included a remote First Cause; but they were both Eastern
and heretical in their monistic denial of personal immortality,
and they had gained considerable popularity in thirteenth-century
Europe before Saint Thomas managed to reclaim Aristotle for the
faith. Pantheistic tendencies appeared in the medieval Jewish
mysticism of the Cabala, and the latter movement did much to
shape the thought of Spinoza in the seventeenth century. The
philosophy of the Jewish Dutchman was wholly pantheistic,
equating God with creative Nature and creative Nature with God.
Spinoza also denied the possibility of personal immortality. He
did, however, speak of the immortality of the mind in language
which might well set psychedelic bells to ringing:
&quot;Nevertheless we feel and know by experience that we are
eternal.... Although, therefore, we do not recollect that we
existed before the body, we feel that our mind, in so far as it
involves the essence of the body under the form of eternity, is
eternal, and that this existence of the mind cannot be limited by
time nor manifested through duration.&quot; (A hundred micrograms
of LSD will make that statement perfectly intelligible.) For his
intellectual pains, Spinoza was excommunicated by his temple in
Amsterdam. But he had considerable influence on later
philosophers, including Hegel. Hegel's system of absolute
idealism proposed that the universe consists of a single absolute
Mind or Spirit which is attempting to realize and comprehend its
own nature through an evolutionary process. Hegel in turn
influenced such disparate thinkers as Karl Marx, Teilhard de
Chardin, and Thomas J. J. Altizer. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of the more fragile nuances of Eastern
philosophy perhaps are best caught in poetry&#151;and the poetry
of the West abounds in Oriental themes or hints of them. We could
quote countless examples but will limit ourselves to only a few,
offering them in the hope they may serve to sharpen some of these
ideas, and to show that the ideas as such have a definite place
in Western literature as well as philosophy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shakespeare, to begin with, certainly lends himself
to an esoteric interpretation. The Delphic injunction, Know
Thyself, is echoed in Polonius' fatherly advice to Laertes:
&quot;This above all: to thine own self be true, and it must
follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any
man.&quot; That might easily be taken to reflect the Hindu idea
that men abuse one another only through ignorance of their
monistic continuity, and that knowledge of the true Self
therefore will automatically result in a perfect morality. And
Hamlet himself sums up that delusion of the rational intellect
which gives rise to the dualistic concept of evil: &quot;There is
nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.&quot;
Shakespeare plainly is a commerce-clause bard par excellence, and
nobody has described the Net of Illusion so well as his Prospero:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our revels now are ended. These our actors,<br>
    As I foretold you, were all spirits and<br>
    Are melted into air, into thin air;<br>
    And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,<br>
    The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,<br>
    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,<br>
    Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,<br>
    And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,<br>
    Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff<br>
    As dreams are made on, and our little life<br>
    Is rounded with a sleep. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We must of course include John Donne: &quot;No man
is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the
continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the
sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well
as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any man's
death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and
therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls
for thee.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Blake's poetry can be taken as a whole. It rejects
the rational intellect and its dualistic perceptions, and indeed
it gives the Eden story an interpretation quite similar to that
suggested in an earlier chapter: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Serpent Reasonings us entice<br>
    Of Good &amp; Evil, Virtue &amp; Vice....<br>
    Two Horn'd Reasoning, Cloven Fiction,<br>
    In Doubt, which is Self contradiction,<br>
    A dark Hermaphrodite We stood,<br>
    Rational Truth, Root of Evil &amp; Good. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Blake had his own term for the Net of Illusion:
&quot;the mind-forg'd manacles.&quot; He rejected the intellect,
the phenomenal world, the God of Theism. He rejected everything
but man's eternal spirit, and he looked back with longing to the
Universal Brotherhood of Eden, to the Universal Man, to the
&quot;Immortal Man that cannot Die.&quot; Blake in fact was a
Gnostic, and his <i>Prophetic Books</i> revive the concept of the
Demiurge. His Urizen (&quot;your reason&quot;?) is that sinister
deity who was responsible for the fall from pure Being and the
world of appearances. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Earth was not: nor globes of attraction;<br>
    The will of the Immortal expanded<br>
    Or contracted his all flexible senses;<br>
    Death was not, but eternal life sprung.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then came Urizen with his ten thousands of
thunders, and a shadow of horror was risen in Eternity. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Eternal mind, bounded, began to roll<br>
    Eddies of wrath ceaseless round &amp; round,<br>
    And the sulphureous foam, surgeing thick,<br>
    Settled, a lake, bright &amp; shining clear,<br>
    White as the snow on the mountains cold.<br>
    Forgetfulness, dumbness, necessity,<br>
    In chains of the mind locked up,<br>
    Like fetters of ice shrinking together,<br>
    Disorganiz'd, rent from Eternity . . . </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That eternal life, the furnace of all creation, was
the subject of Blake's best-known poem, which Alfred Kazin has
aptly termed &quot;a hymn to pure being.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pure Being, from which sprang the Tyger. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In what distant deeps or skies<br>
    Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
    On what wings dare he aspire?<br>
    What the hand dare seize the fire? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After Blake, as might be expected, the Romantic
poets come to mind&#151;and one of the best examples would
naturally be Shelley, who abandoned rationalism and atheism to
become a full-blown Platonic idealist. As for the Passing Parade
of Phenomena, compare that fragile speech of Prospero's and
Shelley's stark: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br>
    Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&quot;<br>
    Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
    Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br>
    The lone and level sands stretch far away. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as our contemporary mystics are dismissed upon
the grounds of biochemical imbalance, so too has the Romantic
movement been supplied now with a medical interpretation. The
poets did not know it, but the source of their inspiration was a
bacillus, the mood of that period resulting from the prevalence
of tuberculosis. Keats was a victim of the disease, although
Shelley insisted the critics had done his friend in, and
Shelley's Platonic philosophy finds full expression in his elegy
to the dead poet: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The One remains, the many change and pass;<br>
    Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly;<br>
    Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,<br>
    Stains the white radiance of Eternity,<br>
    Until Death tramples it to fragments.&#151;Die,<br>
    If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!<br>
    Follow where all is fled!&#151;Rome's azure sky,<br>
    Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are weak<br>
    The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then to Wordsworth, poet of the mescal drinkers.
His ode, &quot;Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of
Early Childhood,&quot; includes the provocative stanza: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:<br>
    The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,<br>
    Hath had elsewhere its setting,<br>
    And cometh from afar:<br>
    Not in entire forgetfulness,<br>
    And not in utter nakedness,<br>
    But trailing clouds of glory do we come<br>
    From God, who is our home:<br>
    Heaven lies about us in our infancy!<br>
    Shades of the prison-house begin to close<br>
    Upon the growing Boy,<br>
    But He beholds the light, and whence it flows,<br>
    He sees it in his joy;<br>
    The Youth, who daily farther from the east<br>
    Must travel, still is Nature's Priest,<br>
    And by the vision splendid<br>
    Is on his way attended;<br>
    At length the Man perceives it die away,<br>
    And fade into the light of common day. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The poem as a whole might appear to support the
doctrine of pre-existence or reincarnation&#151;an implication
which Wordsworth later admitted &quot;has given pain to some good
and pious persons.&quot; He protested he had not intended
&quot;to inculcate such a belief.&quot; The poem was concerned
with &quot;that dream-like vividness and splendour which invest
objects of sight in childhood,&quot; and Wordsworth had cast
about in his mind for some device to express that vision,
deciding finally to picture it as &quot;presumptive evidence of a
prior state of existence.&quot; He explained further: &quot;I
took hold of the notion of pre-existence as having sufficient
foundation in humanity for authorizing me to make for my purpose
the best use of it I could as a poet.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The argument about this stanza, and about
Wordsworth's intentions, is extremely significant. It offers us a
key. And that key fits many locks. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It may give us access to the real issues and deeper
meanings that are still half-hidden below the surface of Eastern
philosophy, the drug movement, and radical theology. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Professor Arthur Beatty, a Wordsworth authority,
suggested that the poet really meant to say: &quot;It is as if
our birth were but a sleep and a forgetting.&quot; And that is
the key. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Consider, for example, a comment that Coleridge
made about the poem: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>But the ode was intended for such readers only as had been
    accustomed to watch the flux and reflux of their inmost
    nature, to venture at times into the twilight realms of
    consciousness, and to feel a deep interest in modes of inmost
    being, to which they know that the attributes of time and
    space are inapplicable and alien, but which yet can not be
    conveyed save in symbols of time and space. For such readers
    the sense is sufficiently plain, and they will be as little
    disposed to charge Mr. Wordsworth with believing the Platonic
    pre-existence <i>in the ordinary interpretation of the words</i>,
    as I am to believe that Plato himself ever meant or taught
    it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The italics are ours. And the point is simply this:
that poets are poets, and they express themselves in the language
of poetry &#151;saying <i>&quot;is&quot;</i> when they mean <i>&quot;as
if.&quot;</i> Prophets are poets as well, and so are the great
philosophers. And all poets, of whatever kind, have found it
necessary at times to express their ideas in terms of symbol; the
tools of their trade are the simile, the metaphor, the poetic
image, the myth. The Greeks indeed may have held themselves aloof
from the formal figures of speech, but they could and did make
ample use of myth. So, too, perhaps did Jesus, Buddha, and those
faceless authors of the Hindu holy books and the Old Testament.
They were poets all. And we can only guess how often their <i>&quot;is&quot;</i>
really means <i>&quot;as if.&quot;</i> One is tempted to ask, of
course, why they couldn't just come out with it&#151;say what
they meant and so have done with it&#151;and the question is fair
enough. In some cases, however, the people in fact may not have
been ready for meat. In some cases it may be that the poet
himself only half-knew what he meant&#151;knew what he felt, all
right, but could not quite put his finger upon it. In some cases
he may have said what he meant and meant what he said, failing
himself to apprehend the deeper meaning. And finally: he knew
what he felt, and he knew what it meant; but what he felt and
what he knew could not be expressed in conventional language.
Such language simply did not apply in those twilight realms of
consciousness where the poet explored the modes of inmost Being. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is not as fuzzy as it may sound. Many of the
discoveries of modern physics cannot be expressed in conventional
language either; the physicists have been forced to leave
language behind altogether, resorting instead to a complex
mathematical symbolism&#151;a form of myth, if you
will&#151;which cannot be retranslated into words. Many popular
books have been written for the general public on the theory of
relativity, for example; the fact remains that you cannot really
understand the theory unless you have the math. Or so at least
the mathematicians tell us, and we are prepared to take their
word for it, while we are by no means ready to take the mystics
at their word for anything. But the relativity theory is no less
valid because it is expressed symbolically, for in fact
everything is expressed that way. Expression as such is by
definition symbolic: only the thing-in-itself is something more
than a symbol of itself. Language and math, therefore, are
equally symbolic; they are simply different kinds of symbolism.
In any case, it follows that Plato did not necessarily mean that
people really return to life as wolves, hawks, and kites; Blake
did not necessarily mean that there really exists a deity
comparable to Urizen; and <i>&quot;is&quot;</i> does not
necessarily mean <i>&quot;is&quot;</i> every time it occurs in
the various Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, and Jewish scriptures. It
may in many cases mean <i>&quot;as if,&quot;</i> and, when so
interpreted, these various scriptures perhaps are closer in
meaning than they appear. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Using the key provided us, a case could be made
that contemporary developments in theology and psychedelic
experience can be explained essentially in terms of two basic
myths and the conflict between them: the myth of the Demiurge and
the myth of Ulysses. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us leave no doubt as to our own meaning. As we
interpret it, the Demiurge is a symbol of the rational
mind&#151;of the cerebral cortex, which separates man from the
beasts and (it may be) from much else besides. As for the Ulysses
myth, we take it to suggest the presence of an evolutionary
purpose in the cosmos: that is to say, an inherent state of Being
as yet unrealized. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We shall return to these concepts later. Meanwhile,
turning from Wordsworth, we skip ahead a few decades and look
across the ocean from Europe to America. </p>

<h2>7. Yankee Hindoos</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Orient's first substantial impact upon America
occurred in a rather indirect manner, in 1492. Or the actual date
might be placed two centuries earlier: it could well be argued
that America owes its discovery to the Great Khan Kublai, lord of
the Tartars, for the hospitality he showed Marco Polo in the
thirteenth century. Columbus of course discovered the new
continent while searching for the fabulous Cathay about which
Marco Polo had written&#151;and there is some irony in the fact
that Polo's book contains one of the earliest accounts of the
psychedelic experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Passing through Persia, the Venetian merchant
learned the history of the Old Man of the Mountain, who lived in
a castle which concealed a magnificent hidden valley. The Old Man
invited youths to the castle, drugged them with hashish, and had
them carried into the Valley of Delights, where they were wined
and dined and entertained by dainty damsels. After four or five
days the youths were carried back into the castle and told they
had been in the Moslem Paradise. The Old Man could send them
there any time he wanted, he said, if they would carry out his
wishes&#151;which usually meant killing somebody. This band of
happy cutthroats became known as &quot;hashshashins,&quot; from
which we have derived the word <i>assassin</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The barbarian invasions and the fall of Rome had
cut the old Silk Road into Hither Asia, and later the Crusades
served to divert Europe's attention still further from the
Orient. There had been virtually no contact whatever between East
and West when Marco Polo arrived in Tartary with his father and
uncle, and indeed the Polos were the first Westerners Kublai Khan
had ever seen. The promise of a restored relationship was
shattered when the Chinese overthrew the Tartars and slammed the
door on foreigners; then the Turks spread across Central Asia,
effectively padlocking the door&#151;and just incidentally
forcing Columbus to seek a sea route to Cathay. The English
penetrated India by the late seventeenth century, following the
Portuguese; but China kept all foreign devils out until the
middle of the last century, and Japan was a <i>terra incognita</i>
until Admiral Matthew Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay in 1853. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is understandable, then, that America was a long
time making its own discovery of the East. The young country's
first real introduction to Asian philosophy was provided by the
New England Transcendentalists, whose writings were often a
bewildering blend of Unitarianism and Orientalism, of Yankee
self-reliance and Hindu self-abnegation. The influence of
Romantic idealism and German philosophy also was evident. Thus
readers of <i>The Dial</i> in 1841 found themselves asking, with
Frederic Henry Hedge: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hath this world, without me wrought,<br>
    Other substance than my thought?<br>
    Lives it by my sense alone,<br>
    Or by essence of its own? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Margaret Fuller wrote of Man as a whole: &quot;As
this whole has one soul and one body, any injury or obstruction
to a part, or to the meanest member, affects the whole. Man can
never be perfectly happy or virtuous till all men are so.&quot;
Thoreau wrote of his inspiration: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I hear beyond the range of sound,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I see beyond the range of sight,<br>
    New earths and skies and seas around,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; And in my day the sun doth pale his light.... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It speaks with such authority,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; With so serene and lofty tone,<br>
    That idle Time runs gadding by,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; And leaves me with Eternity alone.... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Such fragrance round my couch it makes,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; More rich than are Arabian drugs,<br>
    That my soul scents its life and wakes<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The body up beneath its perfumed rugs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the last stanza suggests, Thoreau undoubtedly
would have no part of LSD were he alive today. In <i>Walden</i>
he observed, &quot;I prefer the natural sky to an opium-eater's
heaven.&quot; The point is, however, that Thoreau could turn
himself on, needing only that natural sky for a psychedelic, and
he was wholly preoccupied with the modes of inmost being. There
was no object in going around the world to count the cats in
Zanzibar, he said. &quot;Be rather the Mungo Park, the Lewis and
Clark and Frobisher, of your own streams and oceans.... Nay, be a
Columbus to whole new continents and worlds within you, opening
new channels, not of trade, but of thought. Every man is the lord
of a realm beside which the earthly empire of the Czar is but a
petty state, a hummock left by the ice.... it is easier to sail
many thousand miles through cold and storm and cannibals, in a
government ship, with five hundred men and boys to assist one,
than it is to explore the private sea, the Atlantic and Pacific
Ocean of one's being alone.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for the dualism of good and evil: &quot;I love
to see that Nature is so rife with life that myriads can be
afforded to be sacrificed and suffered to prey on one another....
The impression made on a wise man is that of universal innocence.
Poison is not poisonous after all, nor are any wounds
fatal.&quot; As for the verbal mind: &quot;I know not the first
letter of the alphabet. I have always been regretting that I was
not as wise as the day I was born.&quot; As for the rational
sense of time: &quot;Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I
drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect
how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away, but eternity
remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom is
pebbly with stars.&quot; And as for the comforts of formal
religion: &quot;I believe that men are generally still a little
afraid of the dark, though the witches are all hung, and
Christianity and candles have been introduced.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One passage in <i>Walden</i> strikes a particularly
responsive chord for psychedelic cultists. Indeed, William James
singled out the same passage as exemplifying those moments we all
have &quot;when the universal life seems to wrap us round with
friendliness&quot; and those hours &quot;when the goodness and
beauty of existence enfold us like a dry warm climate, or chime
through us as if our inner ears were subtly ringing with the
world's security.&quot; The oft-quoted passage: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I have never felt lonesome, or in the least oppressed by a
    sense of solitude, but once, and that was a few weeks after I
    came to the woods, when, for an hour, I doubted if the near
    neighborhood of man was not essential to a serene and happy
    life. To be alone was something unpleasant. But I was at the
    same time conscious of a light insanity in my mood, and
    seemed to foresee my recovery. In the midst of a gentle rain
    while these thoughts prevailed, I was suddenly sensible of
    such sweet and beneficent society in Nature, in the very
    pattering of the drops, and in every sound and sight around
    my house, an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all at
    once like an atmosphere sustaining me, as made the fancied
    advantages of human neighborhood insignificant, and I have
    never thought of them since. Every little pine needle
    expanded and swelled with sympathy and befriended me. I was
    distinctly made aware of the presence of something kindred to
    me, even in scenes which we are accustomed to call wild and
    dreary, and also that the nearest of blood to me and humanest
    was not a person nor a villager, that I thought no place
    could ever be strange to me again.... &quot;How vast and
    profound is the influence of the subtile powers of Heaven and
    of Earth! We seek to perceive them, and we do not see them;
    we seek to hear them, and we do not hear them; identified
    with the substance of things, they cannot be separated from
    them.&quot; . . . I only know myself as a human entity; the
    scene, so to speak, of thoughts and affections; and am
    sensible of a certain doubleness by which I can stand as
    remote from myself as from another. However intense my
    experience, I am conscious of the presence and criticism of a
    part of me, which, as it were, is not a part of me, but
    spectator, sharing no experience, but taking note of it, and
    that is no more I than it is you. When the play, it may be
    the tragedy, of life is over, the spectator goes his way. It
    was a kind of fiction, a work of the imagination only, so far
    as he was concerned. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One wonders whether Huxley's antagonist R. C.
Zaehner would dismiss that as natural mysticism or as monistic
mysticism, or possibly as both. Theistic it is not. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Emerson probably did more than anybody else in his
time to translate Eastern ideas, as he understood them, into the
American idiom. He informed his readers about a school of
thought, across the sea, which held that &quot;what we call
Nature, the external world, has no real existence&#151;is only
phenomenal. Youth, age, property, conditions, events,
persons&#151;self, even&#151; are successive <i>maias</i>
(deceptions) through which Vishnu mocks and instructs the
soul.&quot; He added his opinion: &quot;I think Hindoo books the
best gymnastics for the mind, as showing treatment. All European
libraries might almost be read without the swing of this gigantic
arm being suspected. But these Orientals deal with worlds and
pebbles freely.&quot; Emerson's poetry is freighted with Eastern
imagery, and his &quot;Brahma,&quot; for example, is almost a
literal rendering of a passage from the <i>Katha Upanishad</i>: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If the red slayer think he slays,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Or if the slain think he is slain,<br>
    They know not well the subtle ways<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I keep, and pass, and turn again. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Yankee monists, Transcendentalism had this to
offer: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I am the owner of the sphere,<br>
    Of the seven stars and the solar year,<br>
    Of Caesar's hand and Plato's brain,<br>
    Of Lord Christ's heart and Shakespeare's strain. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As with Blake, Walt Whitman's poetry as a whole
seems to reflect the viewpoint of Eastern mysticism. In his later
years Whitman gives the impression of somehow being in a
permanent state of <i>satori</i>, and James indeed suggested that
Whitman probably had &quot;a chronic mystical perception.&quot;
Rather tempting bait for speculation is offered by the fact that
Whitman for so many years was little more than a journalistic
hack. What was the source, then, of the inspiration which gave us
<i>Leaves of Grass</i>? Following Wasson, it might be asserted
that the Good Gray Poet at some period in his life was introduced
to hashish or peyote or some other psychedelic, perhaps on that
trip he made to New Orleans. The idea is farfetched, and we shall
not pursue it; the fact remains that, spontaneously or otherwise,
Whitman suddenly began to write poetry which echoes and re-echoes
with Oriental and psychedelic intuitions: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I celebrate myself, and sing myself,<br>
    And what I assume you shall assume,<br>
    For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe it wasn't hashish; maybe it was Hegel.
According to an 1882 entry in <i>Specimen Days</i>, the most
profound theme to occupy the mind of man is the relation between
the Me and the Not Me of the universe. And while Kant and
Schelling perhaps had supplied us with partial answers, &quot;G.
F. Hegel's fuller statement of the matter probably remains the
last best word that has been said upon it . . . illuminating the
thought of the universe, and satisfying the mystery thereof to
the human mind, with a more consoling scientific assurance than
any yet.&quot; Long before that entry was made, however, Whitman
had written in his journal of 1847: &quot;I cannot understand the
mystery, but I am always conscious of myself as two&#151;-as my
soul and I.&quot; He was not contained between his hat and boots,
he later wrote. There also was &quot;the unseen soul of me.&quot;
There also was the square deific, the One. There also was: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Santa Spirita, breather, life,<br>
    Beyond the light, lighter than light . . .<br>
    Ethereal, pervading all, (for without me what were all? what
    were God?)<br>
    Essence of forms, life of the real identities, permanent,
    positive,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; (namely the unseen.) <br>
    Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man,<br>
    I, the general soul . . . </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And just in case anybody should have missed his
meaning: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>What do you suppose creation is?<br>
    What do you suppose will satisfy the soul, except to walk
    free<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; and own no superior?<br>
    What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred
    ways,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; but that man or woman is as good as God?<br>
    And that there is no God any more divine than Yourself?<br>
    And that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally
    mean? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the general soul, read Brahman or pure Being;
for Yourself, read Atman. Clearly, if Wordsworth speaks for the
mescal drinkers, Whitman deserves consideration as the poet
laureate of LSD. He also hinted at an esoteric doctrine of
reincarnation, especially in &quot;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,&quot;
and, like Thoreau and the three monkeys, he heard, saw, and spoke
no evil. As we shall see, the innocent denial of evil in the
universe is the basis for one of the principal charges that would
later be lodged against Whitman, just as it is lodged now against
the psychedelic drug movement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; America was given another injection of Eastern
metaphysics in 1875, when the Theosophical Society was founded in
New York City by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and Henry Steele
Olcott. Madame Blavatsky, a Russian, said that she had studied
under an Eastern master in Tibet, and the Theosophists were
effective in promoting many Hindu and Buddhist concepts including
reincarnation, the monistic brotherhood of man, and the direct,
mystical knowledge of a Universal Self. At the turn of the
century, James's classic study of religious experience had a
profound and lasting influence on theology and psychology; it
opened the eyes of scholars and laymen to whole new realms of
consciousness, probing deeply into the mystical awareness of East
and West alike. On a lesser scale, R. M. Bucke helped to lay the
groundwork for future developments by popularizing the concept of
&quot;cosmic consciousness.&quot; Bucke, a Canadian psychiatrist
and a contemporary of James, wrote in 1901: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The prime characteristic of cosmic consciousness is a
    consciousness of the cosmos, that is, of the life and order
    of the universe. Along with the consciousness of the cosmos
    there occurs an intellectual enlightenment which alone would
    place the individual on a new plane of existence&#151; would
    make him almost a member of a new species. To this is added a
    state of moral exaltation, an indescribable feeling of
    elevation, elation, and joyousness, and a quickening of the
    moral sense, which is fully as striking, and more important
    than is the enhanced intellectual power. With these come what
    may be called a sense of immortality, a consciousness of
    eternal life, not a conviction that he shall have this, but
    the consciousness that he has it already. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bucke might easily have been describing the
deep-seated conviction of a psychedelic cultist&#151;and in fact
some of the cultists have begun now to speak of themselves as a
new species: as the forerunners of an emerging race of psychic
mutants who will transcend the world to attain the nirvana of
pure Being. Even at the time Bucke wrote, experimentation was
beginning with various psychedelic agents then available. As
mentioned, James himself was exploring the implications of
nitrous oxide intoxication. Havelock Ellis had been dabbling with
mescaline. And during the latter part of the nineteenth century,
American Indian tribes had begun to use peyote as a sacrament in
their religious ceremonies, leading finally to the establishment
of the psychedelic Native American Church, which now has an
estimated quarter-million members. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The new century saw a proliferation of cults,
sects, and societies whose teachings often were a combination of
mumbo jumbo and Eastern philosophy (for example, the I AM
movement). Some of the issues at stake were translated to the
secular and political level; the conflict between monism and
pluralism reappeared in the antagonism between democratic
individualism and the anthill conformity of fascism and
communism: even the Rotary Club orator fulminating against
creeping socialism and the Washington octopus was in a very real
sense addressing himself to one of the most basic problems of
metaphysics and East-West theology: the Many versus the One. As
far as the laying of a groundwork is concerned, significance must
also be attached to the new respectability which parapsychology
gained as a result of the studies inaugurated at Duke University
in 1930 by J. B. Rhine. The painstaking research devoted to such
phenomena as extra-sensory perception and psychokinesis would
lend its scientific aura to the astonishing statements which
would later be made by the prophets of the drug movement, making
those statements sound not quite so astonishing to an empirically
minded generation. Indeed, it is possible that the Duke research
has a direct bearing on the validity of psychedelic experience.
As the ultra-cautious Rhine explained in 1947: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The research in parapsychology even now touches other
    great issues of religion. If the mind of man is nonphysical,
    it is possible to formulate a hypothetical picture of a
    nonphysical system or world made up of all such minds
    existing in some sort of relationship to each other. This
    leads to speculative views of a kind of psychical oversoul,
    or reservoir, or continuum, or universe, having its own
    system of laws and properties and potentialities. One can
    conceive of this great total pattern as having a transcendent
    uniqueness over and above the nature of its parts that some
    might call its divinity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Eastern themes were everywhere. Even the schoolgirl
was not immune as she turned the treasured pages of Kahlil
Gibran's <i>The Prophet</i>. &quot;Fare you well, people of
Orphalese,&quot; said that chosen and beloved one, Almustafa.
&quot;A little while, and my longing shall gather dust and foam
for another body. A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind,
and another woman shall bear me.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The floodgates were opened by the outcome of the
Second World War, of course, and one does well to remember that
Zen was &quot;camp&quot; long before LSD. Buddhist study groups
sprang up. American pupils and housewives could be found writing
haiku poetry in grade-school classrooms and on the backs of
grocery shopping lists. Bookstore racks gave prominent display to
paperback editions of the <i>Upanishads</i>, the <i>Bhagavad-Gita</i>,
the <i>Tao Te Ching.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These developments perhaps were inevitable;
nevertheless, it seems fair to say that the Eastern influx could
not have attained its present magnitude had it not been for the
conscious and dedicated efforts of five men: Carl Jung, Daisetz
T. Suzuki, Alan W. Watts, W. Y. Evans-Wentz, and Aldous Huxley.
Jung's concept of the collective unconscious has Oriental
connotations, and Jung in addition had an abiding interest in
Eastern metaphysics: he lent the authority of his name to works
on Zen and related subjects, writing forewords and commentaries
which expressed his enthusiasm, and he once affirmed that the <i>Tibetan
Book of the Dead</i> had been a &quot;constant companion&quot; to
which he owed &quot;not only many stimulating ideas and
discoveries, but also many fundamental insights.&quot; Suzuki, a
Japanese scholar who died only recently in Tokyo, wrote literally
scores of books in which he sought to interpret Zen for Western
readers, and he also lectured widely in American universities.
Watts complemented Suzuki by examining Zen through Western eyes;
a gifted interpreter and popularizer of complex ideas, he has
made Eastern wisdom comprehensible to a vast audience through
books, lectures, and television classes. Evans-Wentz introduced
the West to the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, a remarkable
book which deserves our attention if only for the fact that it
has since been adopted as the bible of the drug movement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>&quot;It is a book which is sealed with the
seven seals of silence,&quot;</i> we are told in a foreword by
Lama Anagarika Govinda. <i>&quot;But the time has come to break
the seals of silence . . .&quot;</i> And why? Because &quot;the
human race has come to the juncture where it must decide whether
to be content with the subjugation of the material world, or to
strive after the conquest of the spiritual world.&quot; The
origins of the book go back at least a thousand years. In the
original Tibetan the work is known as the <i>Bardo Thdol,</i>
which means &quot;Liberation by Hearing on the After-Death
Plane,&quot; and the exoteric purpose of the book was
emancipation from the reincarnational wheel of death and rebirth.
The book was read over the bodies of the recently deceased by
those Sages of the Snowy Ranges, the Buddhist lamas of Tibet, and
the idea was to talk a dead person out of seeking reincarnation
in a new body. A dead man was believed to wander in the Bardo or
After-Death Plane for forty-nine days (a symbolic number based on
seven times seven), and during this period&#151;in fact at the
moment of death&#151;he would encounter the Clear Light of the
Void. If he had the understanding which comes with good karma, he
would surrender his sense of individuality and would merge with
that Void, thus ending the matter then and there. But the Void is
terrible to behold if you lack understanding, and many
reincarnations are normally required before one earns one's
karmic passport to nirvana. And so it was that most dead men
would turn in terror from the Clear Light. They would wander in
the Bardo, their senses assaulted by visions both frightful and
beatific&#151;by the Wrathful Deities and the Peaceful
Deities&#151;and finally they would enter the womb to be born
again. In hopes of preventing this, the lamas would therefore
read aloud from the sacred book, a sort of Fielding's guide to
the Bardo region, and the dead men would thus receive detailed
instructions for every stage of their journey. They would be told
that their fear of the Clear Light resulted from their false
sense of self, whose existence the Clear Light quite correctly
appeared to threaten. They would be told that the visions they
saw, apart from the Void, were nothing more than
sangsara&#151;projections of their own minds, which were still
caught in the Net of Illusion. And finally they would be told
that the womb was simply a doorway back to the world of
appearances. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That was the exoteric teaching; but when
Evans-Wentz first presented the book to the West, in 1927, the
suggestion was made that it included or concealed an esoteric
interpretation. Jung, for example, contributed a psychological
commentary in which he asserted that &quot;it is an undeniable
fact that the whole book is created out of the archetypal
contents of the unconscious.&quot; More to the point, Lama
Govinda stated in his foreword that the book &quot;was originally
conceived to serve as a guide not only for the dying and the
dead, but for the living as well.&quot; And that in any case is
what it has since become, whatever the original intention might
have been. More than a quarter-century after its initial
publication, the Evans-Wentz edition came to prominence again in
1954, when Huxley made much of it in his very influential book, <i>The
Doors of Perception</i>. In that book Huxley wrote of his first
experience with mescaline, which he took in his home in
California in the spring of 1953. Huxley reported that at one
point he felt himself on the verge of panic, terrified by the
prospect of ego disintegration, and he compared his dread with
that of the Tibetan dead man who could not face the Clear Light,
preferring rebirth and &quot;the comforting darkness of
selfhood.&quot; Thus the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> was
inexorably linked to the psychedelic experience, and ten years
later, in 1964, there appeared a volume titled <i>The Psychedelic
Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>.
The authors were LSD enthusiasts Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner,
and Richard Alpert, and they boldly offered their own
interpretation of the ancient book: it had to do not with the
death and rebirth of the <i>body</i> but rather with the death
and rebirth of the <i>ego</i> in mystical states of mind. It was
indeed a book for the living. More than that, it provided, in
symbolic imagery, a precise account of the psychedelic
experience. Absorption in the Clear Light is nothing more than a
good trip, in which the psychedelic subject feels himself united
again with the Ground of his Being. It is the apprehension of
pure Being, beyond the sangsaric deceptions of language and
rational perception. And those Peaceful and Wrathful Deities
represent the hallucinatory period which occurs when one fails to
achieve the central experience. A bad trip results inevitably
when the subject refuses to face the Clear Light&#151;violently
resists the disintegration of his ego&#151;and rather than seek
rebirth in another body, he pleads for a shot of Thorazine which
will return him to his own body in the phenomenal world of ego
and rational symbolism. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Huxley's book has a certain historical
significance; what we refer to today as the drug movement may be
said to date from that book, although, as we have attempted to
show, a substantial base for the movement had been in preparation
long before 1954. In any case, the drug movement appeared to
dovetail very neatly with what might be called the Eastern
movement, and it might well be asked if this occurred naturally
or under duress; that is, did the two really fit together, or
were they made to fit? The latter possibility has been suggested
by R. E. L. Masters and Jean Houston, who cite as evidence the
phenomenon they refer to as &quot;galloping agape.&quot; They
assert that the supposed capacity of the psychedelics to promote
feelings of brotherly love was rarely detected during early
research in the 1950's: it became manifest only with the
appearance of love-oriented drug literature. By the same token,
Huxley and other drug enthusiasts are accused of leading their
readers down the lotus path. Masters and Houston criticize the
emergence of a &quot;quasi-Eastern mystique,&quot; of a
&quot;wholesale leap to the East&quot; and a &quot;nebulous chaos
seen as Eastern 'truth.' &quot; These developments are all the
more regrettable since the psychedelic drugs &quot;may genuinely
give some inkling of the complexity of Eastern
consciousness.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Masters and Houston conclude: &quot;To at least
some extent the responsibility for this seduction of the innocent
must lie with such authors as Huxley, Alan Watts, and others who
in their various writings imposed upon the psychedelic experience
essentially Eastern ideas and terminology which a great many
persons then assumed to be the sole and accurate way of
approaching and interpreting such experience.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The charge is serious, if it holds up in court.
Does it? </p>

<h2>8. The evidence of things not seen</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Baudelaire complained in his time that ignorant
persons thought of the hashish dream as a kind of magic theater
where all sorts of miraculous things occur: wonders and marvels,
all unexpected. But in fact, said the poet, hashish has no
miracles to offer; all it does is exaggerate the natural, raising
the same number to a higher power, and the hashish dream
therefore will always be &quot;the son of its father,&quot;
reflecting the thoughts and impressions of the dreamer. Hashish
is a mirror&#151;&quot;a magnifying mirror, it is true, but only
a mirror&quot;&#151;and a man will see revealed in it
&quot;nothing except himself.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Evans-Wentz suggested that a wanderer on the Bardo
plane would see the gods of his own pantheon: a Christian would
see the Christian Heaven, a Moslem would see the Moslem Paradise,
an American Indian would see the Happy Hunting Ground, and a
materialist would experience after-death visions &quot;as
negative and as empty and as deityless as any he ever dreamt
while in the human body.&quot; The Tibetans taught, said
Evans-Wentz, that the after-death state is indeed very much like
the ordinary dream state, and whatever visions a man might see on
the Bardo are &quot;due entirely to his own mental-content.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no question that a subject under
psychedelic influence is extremely vulnerable to suggestion,
including autosuggestion, and this might support the contention
that the drug movement's Eastern orientation has been imposed
upon it by an Eastern drug literature. One might also consider
the fact that the drug experience historically has had Oriental
connotations, for what could be a very prosaic reason. The
hashish and opium of the nineteenth century came from the Orient,
and the Eastern imagery which so haunted the European drug fiend
might easily be explained as mental association. Even today the
mere word &quot;drug&quot; may often serve to summon up visions
of Fu Manchu and other sinister-looking Celestials. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The power-of-suggestion argument should not and
cannot be lightly dismissed. What can be dismissed, however, is
the contention that the psychedelic mystique is
&quot;quasi-Eastern&quot; or &quot;nebulous.&quot; Of course it
is nebulous, as we suggested earlier, but that is neither here
nor there; it is no more nebulous than any other metaphysical
assertion which cannot be submitted to empirical demonstration.
And it is not quasi-Eastern. It is Eastern. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If the problem was only one of imagery,
suggestibility would no doubt be sufficient to account for it.
There is no objective reason why LSD should evoke an image of a
Chinese pagoda rather than a Western church, or Ishwara rather
than Jehovah. As Evans-Wentz indicated, even the Eastern
literature acknowledges the subjective factor as far as visual
content is concerned&#151;and it can afford to do so precisely
because it regards the Bardo visions as delusional: the
phenomenal gods and paradises and hells do not really exist
except in the mind of the dreamer, and that is just the point the
Eastern philosopher is trying to make. It is only the Clear Light
which matters and is real. Similarly, no particular importance is
attached to the hallucinatory period in psychedelic sessions; all
that matters is the central experience, which corresponds with
the apprehension of the Clear Light. Nor is the terminology used
of any significance. You can refer to the central experience as
the Clear Light, or as God, or as anything you wish. The question
which remains, then, is whether or not the central experience can
be imposed by suggestion. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for Baudelaire's statement, a drug cultist could
easily turn it around to suit his own purposes. The psychedelics
do indeed offer us a mirror, and a very accurate one at that.
When a man looks into it, he sees nothing except himself&#151;and
this is just as it should be. That is the whole idea, right
there. There is nothing else to be revealed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We should keep in mind that the Eastern movement
did not grow out of the drug movement; if anything, it was the
other way around. The Eastern movement was well established when
Dr. Hofmann made his serendipitous discovery, and the factors
behind that leap to the East had little or nothing to do with
suggestion. The Eastern movement absorbed the drug movement, and
it did so because the central experience seemed to lend itself
very well to an Eastern interpretation. But why weren't the
Eastern implications obvious to begin with? Why did they have to
be interpreted? Why didn't psychedelic subjects know they were
having Eastern experiences? Why did they <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; have to be told? A possible answer, of course, is
that they did know&#151;but did not know that they knew. They
knew they were having some sort of an experience, but how were
they to know it was an Eastern experience unless they had some
knowledge of Eastern philosophy? If they did have the proper
background, they might have recognized their experience as
Eastern in nature&#151;and certainly somebody must have done this
at some point, or how else was the connection made in the first
place? Huxley had a mescaline experience, and he decided it was
Eastern; nobody had to tell him so: he told other people. But
Huxley of course was Eastern-oriented; maybe it was
autosuggestion. And so the circle turns vicious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us turn, then, to the people Huxley told,
assuming they were not Eastern-oriented themselves, and let us
ask why they believed him. They had an experience perhaps, and
they did not know what to make of it; there was nothing they knew
with which to compare it; they did not have the vocabulary to
verbalize their intuitions or even to think them through; the
concepts involved were new and startling, completely bewildering.
Then Huxley and other Eastern enthusiasts provided a vocabulary
and suggested various alternatives and possible conclusions which
might be drawn from the experience. Somehow it seemed to fit, and
people said, &quot;Yes. That's it. That's exactly what it
was.&quot; An analogy might be a robbery victim who flips through
the photographs in a police rogues' gallery and then declares,
&quot;There, that's the man.&quot; Such victims unfortunately
have been notoriously poor witnesses, and even their certainty
leaves a reasonable doubt that a reliable identification has been
made. Still, could a full-scale movement be generated by
suggestion alone, with nothing substantial to support the
suggestion? Surely there is something in the drug experience
which makes the Eastern interpretation at least appear tenable.
Furthermore, supporting evidence is provided by related
developments in radical theology, where a leap to the East also
is occurring, and without benefit of LSD. Watts and Huxley cannot
be blamed for that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor can they be blamed for the results of those
turn-of-the-century experiments with nitrous oxide.
Significantly, James found that the anesthetic (psychedelic)
revelation tended to suggest &quot;a monistic insight, in which
the <i>other</i> in its various forms appears absorbed into the
One.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even so, from either point of view, we still are
left with a Scotch verdict: not proven. And there the matter
might rest, were it not for a final factor which has to do with
mysticism as such. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fact is that Western church authorities have
generally regarded spontaneous mysticism with a measure of
distrust and sometimes with open hostility. There is first of all
the obvious objection that the mystic in a sense eliminates the
middleman: he deals directly with God and thereby undermines the
church's assumed right to act as religious arbiter. The second
objection is less obvious but more important. It seems mysticism
has shown a distressing tendency toward pantheism and monism, and
the saintly mystic has often been a source of acute embarrassment
to his church. We are talking now about Western mysticism. We are
saying that Western mysticism has tended to be very much like
Eastern mysticism; or, more accurately, all mysticism, Eastern
and Western, has tended to be the same. James noted as a general
trait of the mystic range of consciousness that it &quot;is on
the whole pantheistic and optimistic.&quot; He said further: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This overcoming of all the usual barriers between the
    individual and the Absolute is the great mystic achievement.
    In mystic states we become one with the Absolute and we
    become aware of our oneness. This is the everlasting and
    triumphant mystical tradition, hardly altered by differences
    of clime and creed. In Hinduism, in Neoplatonism, in Sufism,
    in Christian mysticism, in Whitmanism, we find the same
    recurring note, so that there is about mystical utterances an
    eternal unanimity which ought to make a critic stop and think
    . . . </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Churchmen had stopped to think about it long before
James made the suggestion, and they did not like what they were
thinking. Mysticism too often had quite a lot to say about God's
immanence and not very much to say about his transcendence; it
had a lot to say about the divine encounter, but in many cases
that seemed to imply a monistic absorption, not union through
love. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Traditionally, the concern of the church has been
in three areas: (1) the institutional, (2) the rational, and (3)
the mystical. In the first, the church has sought to create a
community of faithful with a heritage of common belief; in the
second, it has sought to adduce logical proofs for the existence
of God; in the third, it has sought to put church members in
direct contact with the source of their faith. And every age has
given these elements different emphasis. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Roman Catholicism has had its great mystic
saints&#151;Saint Theresa, Saint John of the Cross&#151;but it
also has had such thorns in the side as Master Eckhart, a
Dominican, whose mystical utterances in fourteenth-century
Germany sounded very much like pantheism. The rational Saint
Thomas largely ignored mysticism, and Roman Catholicism took the
position that God's existence could be proved intellectually. A
severe reaction against mysticism occurred in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, led by the Jesuits and provoked in part by
the excesses of the Quietists (Molinos, Madame Guyon, Fenelon).
Quietism was accused of perverting the contemplative aspect of
mystical experience; it recommended total annihilation of the
mind, of the self, of all desire, including even the desire for
salvation; it blurred or erased altogether the distinction
between evil and good, man and God; wholly passive, it eschewed
all thoughts and acts of service or devotion; it sought divine
inspiration in the &quot;soft and savory sleep of
nothingness&quot;; in its extreme form it produced a state of
&quot;mystic death&quot; which bordered on catatonia. The
practical and beloved Saint Theresa, reformer of the Carmelite
Order, had combined the active and the contemplative life, as
indeed had Jesus before her. By comparison, the Quietists
appeared apathetic and amoral, if not immoral; they were charged
with &quot;idle basking in the divine presence,&quot; and their
doctrines were condemned by Popes Innocent XI and Innocent XII.
Mysticism in all its manifestations came under suspicion, and
Catholics were advised that the mystical experience was a gift
from God, not to be sought after. While this attitude was later
softened, the Catholic reaction to Quietism quite likely has yet
to run its course; nor can there be much doubt that the Vatican
would tend to make a mental equation between the demand for a
direct person-to-God relationship and the sort of thinking that
resulted in the Reformation. Antagonism toward a mystical
emphasis also was evident in Rome's dispute with the Catholic
Modernists during the early years of the twentieth century. The
Modernists could scarcely be accused of Quietism&#151;they were
in fact activists who believed in living their faith, and they
strove for a liberal synthesis of the new science and orthodox
belief. But they also were at odds with their church's stress on
the rational knowledge of God, and especially so with the revival
of the Scholastic tradition which was implicit in the emergence
of Neo-Thomism. Rejecting religious intellectualism, they called
instead for a religion of the inner way: of the heart, not the
mind. Pope Pius X described their synthesis as a &quot;synthesis
of all heresies.&quot; Their doctrines were condemned in 1907,
and the Modernist movement was crushed by excommunication. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We have already mentioned the mysticism of the
Jewish Cabala, and in the following chapter we shall discuss at
some length the flowering of Hasidism in the philosophical
thought of Martin Buber. Turning to Protestantism, we find, as
might be expected, that the mystic at first met with a friendly
reception: the desire for a personal intimacy with God was one of
the root causes of the Christian schism. Luther himself was a
mystic. But even within Protestantism, restrictions were placed
upon the complete freedom of intuitive experience&#151;which led
in turn to such developments as creedless Quakerism and the
Quaker-meeting concept of personal communion with the indwelling
Christ: the Inner Light. In the present century, Protestant
mysticism came under fire from the heavy guns of Karl Barth and
Emil Brunner. The barrage was devastating (or seemed to be), and,
outside the revivalist's tent, spontaneous inner experience gave
way to a general emphasis upon creeds and community of worship.
Maybe it was not so much Barth as it was the overall decline in
religious conviction&#151;and therefore also in religious awe.
Maybe it was just an end-product of secularization. But in any
case it occurred. Or such at least was the opinion of Carl Jung
and others who warned that the churches to their peril were
ignoring their fundamental mission and their basic source of
strength. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the church critics saw it, that fundamental
mission was to put men in personal touch with their God&#151;to
encourage, in other words, the divine-human encounter. And that
basic source of strength was the mystical perception of the
nonrational mind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Such an argument makes mystical perception the
primary source of religious faith.</i> To follow the argument,
however, it is necessary first to define faith. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A skeptic has defined faith as believing in
something you know is not true. And many devout persons might
actually agree with that. As Kierkegaard expressed the same idea,
faith would not be faith if there were any rational basis for it.
Faith and reason are mutually exclusive, the one beginning where
the other ends, and a faith based on reason would be a
contradiction in terms; it would in fact be reason, not faith:
just one more example of ratiocination and logical analysis.
Absolute faith recognizes the utter impossibility of its claim;
to make the movement of absolute faith, you must first make the
movement of absolute resignation&#151;and then you believe
anyway, &quot;by virtue of the absurd.&quot; And this is faith.
The knight of faith knows that &quot;the only thing that can save
him is the absurd, and this he grasps by faith.&quot; He
acknowledges the impossibility, &quot;and that very instant he
believes the absurd; for, if without recognizing the
impossibility with all the passion of his soul and with all his
heart, he should wish to imagine that he has faith, he deceives
himself.&quot; Paul Tillich expressed a similar view, insisting
that absolute faith must be preceded by absolute doubt and
despair. You confess that existence is meaningless, and then you
accept your existence <i>in spite of</i> this&#151;and this
&quot;courage to be&quot; in the face of meaninglessness is in
itself meaningful. Where does it come from, if not from Being
itself? What does it represent, if not the power and the purpose
of the godhead? &quot;The act of accepting meaninglessness is in
itself a meaningful act. It is an act of faith.&quot; And so on.
But it is possible to define faith in an entirely different way
as well, and perhaps an inkling of this can be found in Hebrews: <i>&quot;Now
faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen.&quot;</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; John in his Epistle does not say that faith is
based on the absurd; he says it is based on <i>evidence</i>.
Science is based on the evidence of things seen. Faith is based
on the evidence of things not seen. Both, then, are forms of
deduction, and they differ only in the methods which they employ
to gather their evidence: science relies upon the rational mind
or the conscious; faith relies upon the intuitive mind or the
unconscious. This is precisely what Jung was talking about: he
said the churches were ignoring the vital role of the
unconscious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The churches perhaps were having enough trouble
with science and so were in no mood to encourage a free-wheeling
mysticism which might lead to a further erosion of orthodox
dogma. But Jung and other critics believed that religion was
making its stand on the weakest ground available. The logical
proofs for God's existence were not very convincing. Even if they
were, the intellect would reject them if instinct said no. Nor
did it do any good to urge more faith, because faith is not an
effort of will but, rather, a conviction based upon the evidence
of things not seen. And the ultimate and only source of this
evidence is the unconscious. &quot;The unconscious,&quot; said
Zen scholar Suzuki, &quot;is the matrix of all metaphysical
assertions, of all mythology, of all philosophy.&quot; Years
before, James had suggested that the unconscious was man's
liaison to that unseen or mystical world for which the word God
is &quot;the natural appellation.&quot; He proposed that the
unconscious sends us whispers of that other world &quot;even as
the waters of the infinite ocean send their waves to break among
the pebbles that lie upon our shores.&quot; He said that all of
man's ideal impulses appear to originate in that other world; if
there <i>are</i> spiritual agencies out there, he argued, it
seems only logical that they should communicate with us through
&quot;the subconscious continuation of our conscious life.&quot;
&quot;If there be higher powers able to impress us,&quot; he
said, &quot;they may get access to us only through the subliminal
door.&quot; And Jung agreed. But he charged that the churches
were concerned only with creeds&#151;with &quot;traditional and
collective convictions which in the case of many of their
adherents are no longer based on their own inner
experience.&quot; Unreflecting belief, he said, &quot;is
notoriously apt to disappear as soon as one begins to think about
it,&quot; and in any case it is &quot;no adequate substitute for
inner experience.&quot; The unconscious is &quot;the only
accessible source of religious experience.&quot; This does not
mean the unconscious is God. It is, however, &quot;the medium
from which the religious experience seems to flow.&quot; It is
not the role of the church, said Jung, to rope men into a social
organization and reduce them to a condition of diminished
responsibility. The care of the church should be the individual
soul; the task of the church is &quot;helping the individual to
achieve a metanoia, or rebirth of the spirit.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From this point of view, the unconscious perhaps is
comparable to a shortwave radio receiver. And the church has only
one function: it should help men tune in on God's wavelength, so
to speak, and after that it should drop out of the picture
altogether, making no effort to interpret the transmissions&#151;
much less to jam them. The challenge to church authority becomes
increasingly obvious, and indeed it has always been implicit not
only in outright mysticism but in any form of devotion which
emphasizes inner experience. The challenge was there long before
the word &quot;unconscious&quot; was introduced to the
vocabulary&#151;the Tibetans meant the unconscious when they
spoke of the Knower&#151;and the German theologian Friedrich
Schleiermacher as far back as 1799 was calling for a religion
based exclusively on <i>Ansokauung und Gefhl</i>, or intuition
and emotion. A rejection of all creeds and dogma also was
fundamental to the &quot;spiritual Christianity&quot; proposed
four decades ago by the Russian philosopher Nicolas Berdyaev, and
many other examples could be given. Huxley saw the urge for
self-transcendence as &quot;a principal appetite of the
soul,&quot; and that appetite in our time has not been satisfied
in church; today, &quot;the sole religious experience is that
state of uninhibited and belligerent euphoria which follows the
ingestion of the third cocktail.&quot; Tillich pointed to the
decline of religious awe: the question of our century perhaps was
whether or not man could regain that sense of wonder he had once
known in personal communion with the Ground of his Being. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then came LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With it has come a rebirth of awe. While some
people might debate the assertion that this is religious awe,
many members of the drug movement regard it as such&#151;and the
drug movement, as mentioned, has already produced a number of
psychedelic churches, of which the Church of the Awakening may
serve as an example. The church was incorporated in 1963 under
the laws of New Mexico by John and Louisa Aiken, retired
osteopaths. In a statement of purpose the church defines religion
in its internal aspect as &quot;the search within one's own
consciousness for the Self, which is Being, which is Life.&quot;
And to help the search along the church administers &quot;the
psychedelic sacrament.&quot; In a 1964 decision based on the
First Amendment, the California Supreme Court ruled that Indian
members of the Native American Church could not legally be
deprived of the peyote used in their religious ceremonies. As a
consequence of the widespread legislation against LSD, the Church
of the Awakening and similar organizations such as the
Neo-American Church and Timothy Leary's League for Spiritual
Discovery have indicated they might seek a First Amendment court
test to determine whether freedom of psychedelic religion applies
also to the paleface, and the law's ultimate decision should
prove to be of considerable interest, to say the least. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The drug cults make impressive claims. In the past,
they say, religion probably had real depth for only a minority of
churchgoers. Under the best of circumstances, a direct encounter
with God was reserved for the special few; and even for them the
experience was usually fleeting in nature. There are of course no
statistics available on mystic percentiles, but it is just
possible that psychologist Abraham H. Maslow offers us a rough
clue with his concept of the &quot;self-actualizing&quot; person
who is capable of achieving from time to time what Maslow has
described as a &quot;peak experience.&quot; We shall have much
more to say about Maslow's psychology in a later chapter; for the
moment, we are concerned only with his conclusion that
self-actualization is possible for less than 1 per cent of the
adult population. If peak experience and mystical experience are
similar, and if Maslow's figure is reasonably accurate, it is
rather interesting to find at the other end of the mental
spectrum that schizophrenia is also said to affect about 1 per
cent of the population. By comparison, the studies cited
previously suggest that psychedelics can provide a mystical
religious experience for up to 90 per cent of the population,
which is certainly a considerable improvement. Now, say the
cultists, with LSD it is possible for almost anybody to commune
with God, any time he wants to, and for hours at a stretch. Now
the common man can share the mystical visions of the saints
themselves, and it is no longer necessary to spend ten or twenty
years in a Zen monastery to achieve true <i>satori</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The drug movement says to the churches: &quot;Here,
at last, <i>this</i> is what we were looking for, and never
finding. This is what people really want. What do you have to
offer in its place?&quot; And so orthodoxy and the psychedelic
experience arrive at their collision point. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The institutional challenge is serious, if you
accept the premise that psychedelic experience is actually
mystical experience. Obviously the churches cannot compete with
the drugs in promoting that experience, even if they wished to.
It remains to be asked whether the experience should be
promoted&#151; whether in fact it threatens a jet-age
Quietism&#151;and there are arguments on both sides, to be
discussed later. But what about the doctrinal challenge? Is it
really true that the central drug experience confirms the Eastern
ideas we have mentioned? And why do these ideas have so much
appeal for Westerners in this day and age? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To begin with, psychedelic experience is closer to
Zen than it is to anything else the East has to offer. And Zen is
a unique religion, even in the East. It appears to be monistic
and pantheistic, but actually it is not. Unlike Hinduism, it does
not indulge in elaborate metaphysics; as far as possible it
avoids words altogether, and the student is advised to let the
mildew grow on his lips. Basically anti-intellectual, Zen
stresses intuition and the direct personal experience of reality.
As Suzuki put it, Zen seeks only to grasp &quot;the central fact
of life,&quot; which is found only in the here and now. It is
aimed at those &quot;who die of hunger while sitting beside the
rice bag.&quot; Unlike other schools of Buddhism, it does not
regard the world as illusory, an epiphenomenon of the mind; like
Saint Thomas, it rejects any dichotomy between body and spirit
(as it rejects all other dualistic concepts): in essence it is a
yes-saying to life and to the world. Suzuki was at pains to
refute the idea that Zen is pantheistic. Zen neither confirms nor
denies a transcendent God&#151;another dualism&#151;and if Zen
seems strangely silent about God, that is only because all
statements are limiting. If asked what God is, however, a Zen
master might say, &quot;Three pounds of flax.&quot; And this
sounds pantheistic. If a Hindu said it, it would be pantheistic.
But the Zen master's statement has nothing to do with such ideas;
in calling attention to something quite prosaic, the Zen master
is simply affirming the holiness of the commonplace in the moment
being lived. He might just as easily have eaten a peach, gone for
a walk&#151;or slapped his pupil in the face again. Since <i>satori</i>
can hardly be distinguished from the psychedelic experience, it
is significant that Zen scholarship has not found in this insight
any necessary implication of pantheism or monism; since Zen
scholarship represents centuries of study devoted to the very
subject which concerns them, immanence-minded drug cultists might
find cause to re-examine their experience in the light of Zen. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still, the sense of immanence under psychedelic
influence is very pronounced. It is overwhelming. And after all,
as we have already said, it is not necessary for an orthodox
Westerner to reject the concept altogether: it is possible to
conceive of God as both transcendent <i>and</i> immanent. To
borrow an example which has been used before, Shakespeare is
immanent in the characters of <i>The Tempest</i>. In him they
live and move and have their Being. But Shakespeare also
transcends his characters, in the sense that they do not exhaust
his Being; the characters are Shakespeare, but Shakespeare is
something more than Prospero and Trinculo. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the same sense, the indwelling God acts from
within, &quot;through the path of immanence.&quot; He still
transcends the world. But the world might fail to recognize this.
The very fact of immanence could well blind men to God's
transcendent character: in the psychedelic state especially, the
part could easily mistake itself for the whole. As Baudelaire saw
it, the hashish eater imagines himself to be God&#151;and never
thinks to ask himself the haunting question, &quot;Might there
not be another God?&quot; Or to put it another way, &quot;Might
there not be <i>more</i> God?&quot; Thus the psychedelic
experience neither absolutely confirms nor absolutely denies
God's transcendence. If it confirms anything, it confirms his
immanence. And there is nothing in the experience which
necessarily rules out an immanent God who is also transcendent. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as different ages have emphasized either the
mystical or the rational aspect of religion, so too have
immanence and transcendence been in and out of fashion. Saint
Thomas, as might be expected, had attempted in his time to avoid
either one extreme or the other, offering instead a synthesis of
immanence and transcendence. Calvinism, on the other hand,
insisted upon a majestic and omnipotent God who utterly
transcended the pitiful race of man, and transcendence also was
central to the Deism of Voltaire and others for whom God was the
Great Watchmaker: having created the world and its laws, he had
gone off to exist in complete isolation from his creation. The
mystics for their part preached the immanence of God; throughout
history, in fact, whenever orthodoxy has made God too remote and
austere, the mystic prophets have appeared from the wilderness to
reassert his immanence, and respect for immanence has gone hand
in hand with an emphasis upon inner experience in religious
devotion. Immanentist concepts were given powerful expression in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, both in literature and
philosophy. But the first part of the twentieth century saw the
emergence of a kind of neo-Calvinism, and Karl Barth again was in
large part responsible for the development: his objection to
mysticism necessarily included a concomitant objection to
mysticism's accent on immanence, and the result was a renewed
appreciation of divine transcendence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is possible, however, that the neglect of
immanence has been at least partly to blame for the decline of
religious enthusiasm in this era of technology and
secularization. A wholly transcendent God is probably least
compatible with modern science and modern experience&#151;he is
the kind of God modern man finds hardest to accept&#151;and it
does the churches no good to argue that this kind of God is a
caricature. It does no good to insist that the churches have not
preached this kind of God, and it does no good to argue that
theology perhaps has proposed an entirely different kind of God.
Doubtless we give theology and philosophy much more credit than
they deserve. A great philosopher decides something, and we
imagine that he has decided for his entire generation, if not for
the century in which he lived; this school of opinion gives way
to that school of opinion, and we suppose that mankind has been
following the contest like a football match, with critical
interest, and that everybody knows whether this side or that side
has the ball at the moment. If the players would look around,
however, they would find that the crowd is not paying much
attention to the game, or does not understand it, or finds it
hard to keep an eye on the ball. Of course the wholly
transcendent God is a caricature&#151;but a caricature by
definition is a distortion or exaggeration of an actual
characteristic, and an emphasis on transcendence has been a
characteristic of Western theology. Indeed, this characteristic
has mainly served to distinguish Western from Eastern religion,
and it should hardly surprise us to find that a desire to
preserve that distinction has led to an undue emphasis upon it in
the public mind. &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; Ask the
common man that question, and he will assume you are referring to
a transcendent figure of some sort. Ask the uncommon man the same
question; he still will assume that you are referring to
something along those lines. Of course he knows better, but he
takes it for granted that you do not, when you ask the question.
He may say, &quot;Well, that depends what you mean by God.&quot;
The question itself has come to imply that caricature of
caricatures, the bearded monarch on the marble throne&#151;and
that image is inferred even in those cases when it is not
actually implied. Especially is it inferred when the word God is
spoken from the pulpit of a church. The idea is ridiculous, of
course, and that is precisely the reason modern man no longer
believes in it. Unfortunately, he still thinks he is being asked
to believe in it, and that is the root of the problem. Eastern
philosophy, on the other hand, does not ask him to believe in it,
nor does the psychedelic experience ask him to believe in it, and
the credit both give to immanence is without question responsible
for much of the current interest in Eastern ideas and in LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The churches had been complacent. Perhaps they
imagined that the caricature no longer existed, and so they made
no effort to correct it or to offer their parishioners a more
plausible alternative. But the caricature did exist, although few
people believed in it&#151;or in anything else for that matter,
as a direct consequence. The continued existence of the
caricature resulted inevitably in a reaction against it, and
necessarily in a drastic reaction. The idea was so deeply
embedded in popular theology, and churchmen were so ignorant of
this fact, that Altizer had to kill off the transcendent God
altogether before the churchmen displayed any visible signs of
alarm. Then LSD came along. If they now hope to preserve any
vestige of transcendence, the churches might be well advised to
take a fresh look at the weight of their teaching&#151;and start
talking immanence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the decline of Barthianism, this has already
happened in radical theology. Basic to contemporary developments
in this area have been the concept of immanence and the direct
inner experience of that immanence. In Protestantism the reaction
against stark transcendence can be traced progressively from
Tillich to the New Theologians to the Death of God theologians.
In Judaism the voice of Martin Buber has been heard. In Roman
Catholicism immanence is the very heart of Teilhard de Chardin's
theology. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But immanence has always been a dangerous idea, as
we have indicated. Open the door to immanence and pantheism tries
to slip in with it. This too has been happening. </p>

<h2>9. The New Theology</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A coffee shop in Indiana did not seem a very likely
place in which to encounter the Anglican bishop of Woolwich,
England, probably the best-known advocate of the radical New
Theology. But that in fact is where I met him one dreary morning
in 1966, on the Crawfordsville campus of Wabash College. Bishop
John A. T. Robinson had come to Wabash from England to
participate in the annual Lilly Lecture Series, and he looked a
bit weary as he sat there in a corner booth discussing Dr. Thomas
J. J. Altizer's announcement of God's demise. He shook his head
over the idea, wondering aloud how Altizer could justify his
curious position on Judaism. Later we left the shop together,
heading for Robinson's temporary digs at the Caleb Mills House,
and the balding, pink-cheeked bishop seemed a lonely figure as he
walked across the campus through a misty rainfall, his macintosh
flapping in the wind. Some three years before, with the
publication of a little book titled <i>Honest to God</i>, he had
been attacked as a heretic, a traitor to the faith and a false
prophet; now&#151;bitter pill&#151;there were some who regarded
him as a theological square: in fact a real cube. For the moment
at least, the Ground of Being was Out. The Death of God was In. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Honest to God</i> had created a sensation when
it first appeared in 1963. To the astonishment of the author and
his publishers, no doubt, the book became an international best
seller, and total sales had exceeded a million when I met the
bishop. There are as many New Theologies as there are New
Theologians, but Robinson's book has had a tremendous impact both
in Europe and America, and it offers an excellent vantage point
from which to explore the main trends in radical theology just
prior to the emergence of the Death of God school. It is in a
sense a compendium of the ideas that shaped those trends, and
what it did basically was bring together a number of concepts
developed by four contemporary giants of philosophy and theology:
Rudolf Bultmann, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Paul Tillich, and Martin
Buber. But it brought them together in a new synthesis, the most
important aspect of which was a new interpretation of divine
transcendence, and it popularized them for a vast lay readership.
In doing so, it gave expression to the spiritual unrest and
dissatisfaction of laymen who had been theologically
inarticulate, and it helped also to lay a popular groundwork for
the still more radical ideas which were soon to follow in
America. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>From Rudolf Bultmann</i>, to begin with, the
bishop took the concept of &quot;demythologizing&quot; the Bible.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To demythologize does not mean to debunk. On the
contrary. A myth may represent an eternal truth&#151;intuitively
grasped perhaps&#151;but the mode of expression will be dictated
always by the world-view of the men who lived in the age when the
myth was promulgated, and it will reflect also that age's level
of knowledge and sophistication. Its language is metaphorical and
anthropomorphic. The method of demythologizing probes for the
deeper meaning hidden by the metaphor. &quot;Its aim,&quot; said
Bultmann, &quot;is not to eliminate the mythological statements
but to interpret them.&quot; In essence this is the same test we
applied in an earlier chapter to Wordsworth's ode and to poetic
symbolism in general: does the <i>&quot;is&quot;</i> really mean <i>&quot;is,&quot;</i>
or does it perhaps mean <i>&quot;as if&quot;?</i> Suppose, then,
said Bultmann, that the authors of the Bible wanted to convey the
idea of God's transcendence. They could do so only by resorting
to the crude category of space&#151;resulting in a God who is
&quot;up there&quot; in a place called heaven. According to
Robinson, a more sophisticated age refined the veridical myth to
connote a God who was not &quot;up there&quot; but &quot;out
there,&quot; somewhere beyond the flashing comets. But again this
is a crude metaphor, and it no longer satisfies modern man, who
is intruding upon outer space with radio telescopes and rocket
probes. To remain relevant, the truth of God's transcendence must
be demythologized or demetaphorized. It and other biblical truths
must be retranslated in modern terms for men who are able to
digest deeper levels of abstraction. But how? If God is not
&quot;up there&quot; or &quot;out there,&quot; where is he? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>From Dietrick Bonhoeffer</i>, the bishop took
the concept of a Christianity &quot;without religion.&quot; This
is certainly an enigmatic idea, and Bonhoeffer never had an
opportunity to elaborate upon it; it was merely suggested in
letters and notes which he wrote in a Nazi prison before he was
hanged in April 1945. But it has haunted many churchmen with a
moth-to-flame fascination, and it would be difficult to
exaggerate the fundamental influence it has had upon contemporary
theology. For most New Theologians it has served as a sort of
Rorschach ink blot, and each has brought to it his own
interpretation. For Robinson it represented at one level a
rejection of churchiness and otherworldliness. God is neither
&quot;up there&quot; nor &quot;out there.&quot; He is rather, in
Bonhoeffer's words, &quot;the 'beyond' in the midst of our
life.&quot; And that is where we should seek him, in our midst. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Traditionally, said Robinson, religion has implied
withdrawal from the world to a special compartment of life where,
in a sort of spiritual vacuum, one prays and thinks holy
thoughts. Too often, in Ronald Gregor Smith's phrase, it has
implied &quot;a kind of battle against the world on behalf of
God.&quot; One seeks God only in the sanctuary, in the gaps of
life. Inevitably, this attitude has made worship possible, or
profitable, for only a comparatively small cadre of religiously
minded people&#151;for the praying type. And something else. If
God is used simply as a <i>deus ex machina</i> to explain man's
unanswered questions about life and the universe, what happens
when these questions, one after one, are answered? God is pushed
further and further back by the tidal advance of knowledge, said
Bonhoeffer. Man has less and less need of him. &quot;As in the
scientific field,&quot; said Bonhoeffer, &quot;so in human
affairs generally, what we call 'God' is being more and more
edged out of life, losing more and more ground. Catholic and
Protestant historians are agreed that it is in this development
that the great defection from God, from Christ, is to be
discerned.&quot; Indeed, Robinson agreed, Julian Huxley expressed
the same idea or was thinking in the same vein when he observed
that, operationally, God &quot;is beginning to resemble not a
ruler but the last fading smile of a cosmic Cheshire Cat.&quot;
The world has come of age, said Bonhoeffer, and men in a world
come of age should accept their adulthood; they should go about
their business just <i>as if</i> God did not exist, not clinging
to his hand every time there is a street to cross. &quot;God
allows himself to be edged out of the world, and that is exactly
the way, the only way, in which he can be with us and help
us.&quot; Like a parent who wants his child to be self-reliant. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But how does one worship in a post-religious world?
By accepting the world, said Robinson. By seeking the sacred in
the secular, the holy in the common, the beyond in our midst. One
should seek God &quot;in the hungry, the naked, the homeless and
the prisoner.&quot; Prayer should not be a withdrawal from the
world to God but a penetration through the world to God; for
nothing, after all, is really secular: the whole world is holy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>From Paul Tillich</i>, the bishop took the
concept of defining God as the Ground of Being. Tillich rejected
the view that God is in any sense a Being. This rejection applies
of course to the God of Deism, who started the world ticking with
mechanistic precision and then went off somewhere far away and
remote, very much, as Robinson put it, &quot;like a rich aunt in
Australia.&quot; But Tillich also rejected the more familiar God
of Theism, in so far as that implies some kind of supernatural
Person&#151;a separate Being who exists in an intimate
relationship with the world which he transcends. Theism
necessarily does imply this kind of God, said Tillich. It implies
&quot;a being beside others&quot; who is simply a part of
reality&#151;the most important part, but still only a part; it
implies that God &quot;is a being, not being-itself.&quot;
Tillich proposed that theology replace this Being with the Ground
of Being, and that a new dimension be adopted to conceptualize
this reality. As a substitute for height (as in &quot;up
there&quot;) or distance (as in &quot;out there&quot;), Tillich
suggested that we think of God in terms of depth (as in &quot;in
our midst&quot;). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson took up the suggestion, defining God as
&quot;the ultimate depth of all our being, the creative ground
and meaning of all our existence.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The bishop wrote that traditional Christian
theology has concerned itself with adducing proofs for the
existence of God, and the psychological implication, at least, is
that God might not exist. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, then, what happens if we speak of God simply
as ultimate reality or the Ground of our Being&#151;as opposed,
for example, to <i>a</i> Being? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then it is no longer necessary to debate the
existence of God, since nobody doubts there is an ultimate
reality. The whole problem is reduced to speculation about the <i>nature</i>
of this ultimate reality, or God. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lot of people didn't like that. It seemed much
too easy, for one thing. And perhaps there is a basic flaw in the
argument, as we shall see later. In any case, the bishop also
used the Ground of Being as a wedge for the most awesome effort
of all &#151;demythologizing God himself. Behind the various
mythological expressions, what is the ontology of God? What is
the nature of ultimate reality, and what in truth is the real
meaning of transcendence? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>From Martin Buber</i>, the bishop took the
concept of the I-Thou relationship. We have already referred to
this concept; let us examine it now in more detail. Buber was a
mystic, and he began his argument with the proposition that all
men are born with a sense of cosmic connection. The sense of
&quot;I&quot; or individual self is not present at birth, and in
fact the child at first does not distinguish between himself and
the shining world which his eyes have opened upon. In the womb he
had known a life &quot;of purely natural combination, bodily
interaction and flowing one to the other,&quot; and after birth
he still rests for a time &quot;in the womb of the great mother,
the undivided primal world that precedes form.&quot; Buber
recalled the saying of the Jews: &quot;In the mother's body man
knows the universe, in birth he forgets it.&quot; But he does not
forget it all at once, and he never forgets it completely. Before
his sense of natural connection with the world fades gradually
away, the child is given time to establish a sense of spiritual
connection&#151;which Buber referred to as relation. Gradually
there develops a sense of &quot;I&quot; or self&#151; &quot;the
separation of the body from the world round about
it&quot;&#151;but the world nevertheless is still perceived as
existing in relation to the self. It is perceived as Thou, and
this is the I-Thou relationship. But the sense of &quot;I&quot;
grows ever stronger, until at last it snaps the fragile bond of
relation between subject and object, I and Thou. Thou becomes It
(or He or She), and I-It is the primary word of separation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The world perceived as It is something to be used
and exploited, and it is perceived in space and time&#151;whereas
the world as Thou is not perceived in space and time. The world
perceived as It is chopped into isolated segments, and the
segments are ranked in an artificial order; they are organized
for cause-and-effect analysis, so that man can &quot;get his
bearings.&quot; Man no longer looks at the world in relation:
&quot;instead of looking at it he observes it, instead of
accepting it as it is, he turns it to his own account.&quot; And
why? &quot;Only as It can it enter the structure of
knowledge.&quot; This is necessary for survival, because man
cannot live without It. &quot;But he who lives with It alone is
not a man,&quot; and the memory of Thou never dies altogether:
there are &quot;short, uncanny moments&quot; when it reappears,
&quot;lyric and dramatic episodes, seductive and magical.&quot;
The memory of that undivided primal world lingers as &quot;a
secret image of desire,&quot; and Buber implied that this is the
real meaning of the Freudian wish to retreat to the womb. Not at
all the sign of an unhealthy pathology, it represents a natural
longing to re-establish the cosmic connection. Man of course
cannot crawl back into the womb, in this life at least, but he
can relate to the world; he can look for the thing-in-itself,
seeing &quot;each thing simply as being.&quot; He can say
&quot;Thou&quot; to the world, and the world in turn will say
&quot;Thou&quot; back to him. In this relationship a man affirms
the reality of the world&#151;and he affirms also the reality of
himself. For the &quot;I&quot; is very real. With the emergence
of personal life, a man cannot deny his &quot;I,&quot; but he can
choose what sort of &quot;I&quot; it will be&#151;since the
&quot;I&quot; of I-Thou is not the same as the &quot;I&quot; of
I-It. A man can choose to be a <i>person</i> or an <i>individual</i>,
and all men are either persons or individuals: the &quot;I&quot;
of I-Thou is a person, and the &quot;I&quot; of I-It is an
individual. In I-Thou a man does not and cannot surrender his
personality, since the essence of I-Thou is personal relation: an
&quot;I&quot; relating to the Thou. A person does not lose
&quot;his special being, his being different.&quot; But he does
not revel in his special being as the individual does; he simply
accepts it as a necessary part of being in general. He seeks for
the Thou, which he sees in the eyes of every man and every
creature. He lives in the here and now, fully aware that
&quot;the one thing that matters is visible, full acceptance of
the present.&quot; He recognizes that true love is the
&quot;responsibility of an I for a Thou,&quot; and this leads him
at last &quot;to the dreadful point&#151;to love all men.&quot;
He hallows this life, and thus he meets the living God who is
present in every relational event. In every finite Thou he
catches a glimpse of the eternal Thou. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I-Thou was the final ingredient in Robinson's
eclectic omelet; he was ready now to face the question of
God&#151;and the question of God, he acknowledged, was the
question of transcendence. It was certainly the question as far
as the Western God was concerned&#151;no doubt about
that&#151;and the bishop therefore did his best to salvage the
concept. That really was the whole point of his book, although
many of his critics received just the opposite impression. The
task, he said, was &quot;to validate the idea of transcendence
for modern man.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson began with an all-out attack on Theistic
transcendence, agreeing with Tillich that the atheists were quite
correct in rejecting a transcendent Being or supreme Person. The
bishop conceded the fact that classical Christian theology does
not in fact picture God as a Person, and &quot;the Church's best
theologians have not laid themselves open to such attack.&quot;
Nevertheless, he said, &quot;popular Christianity has always
posited such a supreme personality,&quot; and the question really
was whether or not popular theology could afford to sacrifice the
concept. To do so, R. W. Hepburn had written, &quot;seems at once
to take one quite outside Christianity.&quot; Robinson felt,
however, that the concept could be abandoned&#151;indeed it must
be, since the average layman was finding it harder and harder to
take seriously. People must be told, then, that there is no
reason they should take it seriously. &quot;If Christianity is to
survive . . . there is no time to lose in detaching it from this
scheme of thought.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to what does one attach it? To what does
transcendence refer, if not to a transcendent Being? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson groped for an answer. And he found one, he
thought, in man's divine attributes&#151;love, wisdom, justice.
Feuerbach was looking over his shoulder now, and the bishop knew
he was treading &quot;on very dangerous ground.&quot; One slip
and he could easily plunge into the bottomless chasm of humanism
or pantheism, making of man's nature the <i>ens rea lissimum</i>.
The problem perhaps was to identify God as the source of our
higher aspirations, without at the same time making us synonymous
with the source&#151;that is to say, without making man and God
identical. In any case, the bishop pushed on with the idea of
defining God as the Ground of our Being or as ultimate reality.
If God is ultimate reality, what, then, is this ultimate reality?
Tillich had proposed that we think of it in terms of depth, you
will remember, and Robinson quoted Tillich's seminal passage: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The name of this infinite and inexhaustible depth and
    ground of all being is <i>God</i>. That depth is what the
    word <i>God</i> means. And if that word has not much meaning
    for you, translate it, and speak of the depths of your life,
    of the source of your being, of your ultimate concern, of
    what you take seriously without any reservation. Perhaps, in
    order to do so, you must forget everything traditional that
    you have learned about God, perhaps even that word itself.
    For if you know that God means depth, you know much about
    him. You cannot then call yourself an atheist or unbeliever.
    For you cannot think or say: Life has no depth! Life is
    shallow. [Furthermore] . . . speak of the depth of history,
    of the ground and aim of our social life, and of what you
    take seriously without reservation in your moral and
    political activities. Perhaps you should call this depth <i>hope</i>,
    simply hope. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One is reminded also of Tillich's &quot;courage to
be&quot; as an argument for faith. Why this courage? Where does
it come from? In the same sense, why do men hope&#151;and where
does their hope originate if not in the very depths of their
Being? In the last analysis, depth meant for Tillich &quot;those
deep things for which religion stands: the feeling for the
inexhaustible mystery of life, the grip of an ultimate meaning of
existence.&quot; And this mystery&#151;this ultimate
meaning&#151;is the source of the biblical intuition that there
is <i>something</i> which transcends our everyday life and the
world of appearances. There is, to use a clich, more here than
meets the eye. And this &quot;more&quot; is the
transcendent&#151;the not seen. It is that which we normally do
not perceive or recognize, but which nevertheless makes such
urgent demands upon us. It is the truth about ourselves and the
truth about Being itself. &quot;To call God transcendent in this
sense,&quot; said Tillich, &quot;does not mean that one must
establish a 'superworld' of divine objects. It does mean that,
within itself, the finite world points beyond itself. In other
words, it is self-transcendent.&quot; As Robinson expressed it:
&quot;The necessity for the name 'God' lies in the fact that our
being has depths which naturalism, whether evolutionary,
mechanistic, dialectical or humanistic, cannot or will not
recognize.&quot; And in Tillich's words again: &quot;We are
always held and comprehended by something that is greater than we
are, that has a claim upon us, and that demands response from
us.&quot; This is the Ground of our Being, and we can no more
escape it than Francis Thompson could escape the Hound of Heaven.
A trumpet sounds from the hid battlements of Eternity, and a
Voice declares: &quot;All things betray thee, who betrayest Me .
. . Naught shelters thee, who wilt not shelter Me . . . Lo!
naught contents thee, who content'st not Me.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>To thine own Self be true</i>. Is that what this
means? Is that what God means? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At Wabash I had a long talk with Robinson in the
library of the Caleb Mills House, and I asked him, among other
things, &quot;However that word God is finally translated, do you
believe that it transcends our Being?&quot; He replied,
&quot;Yes. I believe, obviously, that God represents a reality
which in a real sense encounters us as it were from without. It
is not something that we think up for ourselves. In many ways I
would find it much easier to invent a very different kind of God,
far less uncomfortable to live with. There is this, I think,
overmastering reality which challenges us, judges us, confronts
us, questions our whole being. It is this element of
otherness&#151;of unconditional grace and demand&#151;which it
seems to me traditional Christianity has meant by transcendence.
This is a dimension of experience in life which I've no desire
whatever to deny. What I am concerned with is to try and find
some way of expressing this dimension which doesn't put God right
at the edge of our whole experience and world.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An unconditional demand would seem to imply a
built-in demand which is forced upon us by the very nature of our
Being. It would seem to imply that we are not completely free to
choose our own destiny and to make of ourselves whatever we
please. Or, to put it another way&#151;and the distinction is
important&#151;we <i>are</i> free to choose, but our freedom is
less than perfect: if we deny the unconditional demand, we will
suffer for it. We will suffer the anguish of alienation from the
Ground of our Being. To boil it down, Sartre was wrong. There is
an essence (unconditional) which precedes our existence and which
gives our existence its meaning and direction; it tells us what
we should do and where we should go. Whether we heed it or not is
up to us. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what is this essence? What is the Ground of our
Being? What is ultimate reality? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In three words, what is God? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In his book, Robinson used three words to answer
those questions. And he took the three words from another book.
To understand his meaning, we must return for a moment to Buber,
to whom the bishop owes a large debt, and we must ask what Buber
meant by the eternal Thou, as opposed simply to Thou. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Buber had no objection to the word God.
Anticipating what was to come, perhaps, he wrote in <i>I and Thou</i>,
first published in 1923: &quot;Many men wish to reject the word
God as a legitimate usage, because it is so misused. It is indeed
the most heavily laden of all the words used by men. For that
very reason it is the most imperishable and most
indispensable.&quot; Buber had no sympathy with the Eastern
concept of absorption in the Absolute, in &quot;the One thinking
Essence.&quot; He spoke of relation, not absorption. He opposed
the doctrine that &quot;universal being and self-being are the
same.&quot; He told of a Face that is sometimes seen, briefly,
when one looks deep into the eyes of a finite Thou. This is God,
the eternal Thou. And this is transcendent. &quot;Every sphere is
compassed in the eternal Thou, but it is not compassed in
them.&quot; &quot;God comprises, but is not, the universe. So
too, God comprises, but is not, my Self.&quot; Nor did Buber
refrain from speaking of God as a Person; in a 1957 postscript to
his book, he wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The description of God as a Person is indispensable for
    everyone who like myself means by &quot;God&quot; not a
    principle (although mystics like Eckhart sometimes identify
    him with &quot;Being&quot;) and like myself means by
    &quot;God&quot; not an idea (although philosophers like Plato
    at times could hold that he was this): but who rather means
    by &quot;God,&quot; as I do, him who&#151;whatever else he
    may be&#151;enters into a direct relation with us men in
    creative, revealing and redeeming acts, and thus makes it
    possible for us to enter into a direct relation with him.
    This ground and meaning of our existence constitutes a
    mutuality, arising again and again, such as can subsist only
    between persons. The concept of personal being is indeed
    completely incapable of declaring what God's essential being
    is, but it is both permitted and necessary to say that God is
    <i>also</i> a Person.... From this attribute would stem my
    and all men's being as person . . . As a Person God gives
    personal life, he makes us as persons become capable of
    meeting with him and with one another. But no limitation can
    come upon him as the absolute Person, either from us or from
    our relations with one another; in fact we can dedicate to
    him not merely our persons but also our relations to one
    another. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Buber conceded that there was an apparent
contradiction in the concept of God as an Absolute Person who
cannot be limited and the assertion that his total Being is in
fact limited &quot;by the plurality of other independent
entities&quot; (namely, us). It is possible that Buber here was
addressing himself to Tillich's criticism of the Theistic God who
is only a part of reality, &quot;a being beside others.&quot;
Buber said, however, that this was not really a contradiction: it
was a paradox. And he added the enigmatic statement: &quot;It is
as the absolute Person that God enters into direct relation with
us. The contradiction yields to deeper insight.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson in his book referred to Buber only in
passing, as it were, and did not give him equal billing with
Bultmann, Bonhoeffer, and Tillich as a major source of
inspiration. Wedded as he was to Tillich's denial of Theism, the
bishop certainly did not refer his readers to the passage we have
cited on God as a Person. Nevertheless, his final conclusions
about God or ultimate reality might very well appear to be a
liberal interpretation of that passage, based perhaps on a
&quot;deeper insight.&quot; At Wabash I mentioned to Robinson
that his concept of transcendence seemed to have a strong streak
of Buber in it, and the bishop agreed. &quot;I think what Buber
is saying is fundamental,&quot; he said. &quot;And in fact this
goes back a long way in my own theological experience, because I
did my Ph.D. thesis on Martin Buber, which has never been
published. This was twenty to twenty-five years ago. And
therefore this represents a long-standing influence on my
thinking. And I think the kind of thing Buber is trying to get at
in this I-Thou relationship&#151;the way he sees every finite
Thou as a sort of glimpse through, a 'window through' into
something which meets us in, with, and under every relationship
of life&#151;this is very near the heart of what I am trying to
say.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Did Robinson in fact demythologize Buber? Was Buber
in fact asking to be demythologized? What might it be, that
&quot;deeper insight&quot;? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although he rejected the idea that God is a Person,
the bishop did affirm that God is <i>personal</i>. This may
appear contradictory at first reading, but we must remember that
Robinson was speaking of God as ultimate reality&#151;as the
truth about existence. &quot;For this way of thinking,&quot; he
wrote, &quot;to say that 'God is personal' is to say that
'reality at its very deepest level is personal,' that personality
is of <i>ultimate</i> significance in the constitution of the
universe, that in personal relationships we touch the final
meaning of existence as nowhere else.&quot; And he quoted
Feuerbach: &quot;To predicate personality of God is nothing else
than to predicate personality as the absolute essence.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But personality in itself is not yet the absolute
essence. If it is only in personal relationships that we touch
the final meaning of existence, what, then, is that final
meaning? What, then, is God? The bishop now was prepared to
answer the question. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; God, he said, is love. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;To assert that 'God is love' is to believe
that in love one comes into touch with the most fundamental
reality in the universe, that Being itself ultimately has this
character.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the &quot;more&quot; which does not meet
the eye. This is the truth about ourselves and the truth about
Being itself. This is the unconditional demand that is made of
us: that we love one another. And this truth, this ultimate
reality, we have objectivized as God. But God as love does not
imply &quot;a super-Being beyond the world endowed with personal
qualities.&quot; No. &quot;To believe in God as love means to
believe that in pure personal relationship we encounter, not
merely what ought to be, but what is, the deepest, veriest truth
about the structure of reality.&quot; It means to believe that
love is the Ground of our Being. It means that &quot;theological
statements are not a description of 'the highest Being' but an
analysis of the depths of personal relationships.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The bishop continued: &quot;A statement is
'theological' not because it relates to a particular Being called
'God' but because it asks <i>ultimate</i> questions about the
meaning of existence: it asks what, at the level of <i>theos</i>,
at the level of its deepest mystery, is the reality and
significance of our life.&quot; And this reality, this final
truth, this God is love. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who, then, was Jesus&#151;the son of God? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson demythologized him, too. Jesus was not a
God-man who came from &quot;out there,&quot; pretending to be a
man. He was not a divine visitant who chose to live &quot;like
one of the natives.&quot; According to the bishop, the
traditional view of Jesus leaves one with the impression that
&quot;God took a space ship and arrived on this planet in the
form of a man.&quot; It leaves the impression that Jesus
&quot;was not really one of us . . . he came from outside.&quot;
And that word incarnation: in itself, it &quot;conjures up the
idea of a divine substance being plunged in flesh and coated with
it like chocolate or silver plating.&quot; But Jesus in fact was
a man; he was in fact one of us. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nevertheless, Jesus also revealed to the world the
Word of God. He was a man, yes&#151;but a man who was completely
united with the Ground of his Being. He made himself
&quot;utterly transparent&quot; to the Ground of Being and thus
offered his fellow-men a window through to ultimate reality. He
did this by emptying himself of self; he was &quot;the man for
others,&quot; and his whole life was a testimony to the fact that
the Ground of all Being is love. I asked the bishop whether the
I-Thou relation did not imply that <i>all</i> men are a window
through to the eternal Thou&#151;hadn't Buber in fact said the
same thing about a cat?&#151; and Robinson answered: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Can I just say two things? First, this
window-through metaphor is obviously very inadequate and just
suggests that God is there to be looked at, whereas the New
Testament takes a far more dynamic view. I mean, here in a real
sense is the activity and love and purpose of God being revealed
and poured out and acting through this man's life. The second
question relates to the uniqueness of Christ. I think I certainly
would not want to say that he is unique in the sense that he is
quite abnormal. I think that it's worth asking: Is Christ unique
because he is normal, or because he is abnormal? Now, I think a
great many people would take from the Gospels as they read them
today that he is unique because he is abnormal&#151;in the sense
that he did all kinds of things we couldn't do, was born in an
entirely different way, had all kinds of miraculous powers, and
so on. Well now, if that is the picture of Christ, then he seems
to me a man who has very little to do with our life at all. It
seems to me what the New Testament fundamentally is saying is
that here is someone who is uniquely normal, what all human life
should be, what a genuinely human existence ought to be. And, on
the whole, this is not true of any other man&#151;we are in a
real sense failing to be what we were meant to be. Now, in that
sense I would certainly say that Christ is unique. But I don't
think he's unique in a sense that cuts him off from the whole of
the rest of humanity. And one of the troubles about so much of
the mythological view of the New Testament is that, for man
today, its effect is to sever this person from everybody else.
After all, the New Testament itself talks about Christ as the
firstborn of many brothers&#151;meaning that there's a real
solidarity here with the whole of the rest of humanity&#151;and I
don't want to draw his uniqueness in any sense which denies this
solidarity, but rather to say that he is the uniquely normal
human being.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In his book Robinson ridiculed supernatural
interpretations of the Atonement&#151;the idea that a divine
Person descended from heaven to save men from sin &quot;in the
way that a man might put his finger into a glass of water to
rescue a struggling insect.&quot; He suggested that sin and hell
are metaphors for man's estrangement from the Ground of his
Being, while union with the Ground of Being &quot;is the meaning
of heaven,&quot; and the experience of grace is the experience of
being accepted in that heaven where, in Tillich's words,
&quot;everything is transformed.&quot; On the level of worship,
the bishop called for a &quot;worldly holiness&quot; and a
&quot;sacred secularity&quot; in which the beyond is sought at
the center of life, &quot;between man and man&quot;&#151;for God
is discovered only in the here and now, in the concrete moment,
in personal relationships: he is not discovered in some other
world, nor is he to be found in the self alone. Finally, the New
Theologian proposed a New Morality&#151;a modern ethic, based on
the Ground of Being, which would take as its credo Saint
Augustine's injunction: &quot;Love God, and do what you
like.&quot; He even suggested that premarital sex might be wrong
only in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, arguing that
&quot;the only intrinsic evil is lack of love.&quot; In an age
that was turning its back on supernatural legalism, he said, he
was only trying to offer a reasonable system, founded on the
absolute priority of love, which could answer that troublesome
question, &quot;Why not?&quot; Thus a boy would not take
liberties with a girl unless he loved her; and if he loved her,
he would not take liberties with her. Or so it seemed to the
bishop. (See his book <i>Christian Morals Today</i>.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson warned his readers not to equate the
eternal Thou with the finite Thou, &quot;nor God with man or
nature.&quot; This, he pointed out, would be pantheism or
humanism, and &quot;Christianity must challenge the assumption of
naturalism that God is merely a redundant name for nature or for
humanity.&quot; With Tillich, he said, he wished instead to push
beyond both supernaturalism <i>and</i> naturalism; it was not his
intention, he said, &quot;to substitute an immanent for a
transcendent Deity,&quot; but rather to reaffirm transcendence in
a new translation. The bishop attempted to demonstrate,
therefore, that his position was not the same as humanism on the
one hand or pantheism on the other. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To rebut the charge of humanism, he returned to his
statement that God is love; this could not be turned around, he
said, to imply that love is God. In other words, divine love is
not simply a projection of human love; on the contrary, human
love is a projection of divine love: it occurs on this earth
because love is the Ground of Being. We recognize human love as
sacred because we see in it the ultimate truth about reality; we
see in it &quot;the divine agape of the universe.&quot; We love
because the Ground of our Being demands that we love. This demand
upon us is unconditional&#151;beyond our control as
individuals&#151;and therefore it transcends us. And this element
of transcendence is what finally distinguishes the humanist from
the radical Christian. The humanist says love <i>ought</i> to be
the final truth about existence; the radical Christian says it
is. Furthermore, the radical Christian says that this final truth
is revealed to us in Jesus Christ, and its validity &quot;stands
or falls&quot; with that revelation. So this in turn is what
finally distinguishes both radical and orthodox Christianity from
all other theologies, Eastern and Western&#151;and, we might add,
from the psychedelic cults. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Turning to the next charge, the bishop conceded
that his rejection of Theism might raise in some minds the
specter of the Eastern God. He acknowledged that it was dangerous
to abandon the concept of God as a separate Being. Indeed, he
said, traditionalists might find it hard to believe that his
position &quot;must not result in a theology of mere immanence,
not to say of pantheism.&quot; But, he said, there was one
element which ultimately distinguished his view from the
pantheistic or immanentist position&#151;and this was the element
of personal freedom: the freedom of the individual person to
accept or deny the Ground of his Being. Pantheism is purely
mechanistic or deterministic; concern for the other is as
automatic as two plus two, since in fact there is no other but
only the monistic One, and this concern cannot properly be
described as love, which is a relationship between persons and
not the Selfish awareness of an Absolute Identity. For example,
you are concerned for the welfare of your arms and legs, but you
would hardly refer to this concern as love. I am extrapolating
now&#151; trying to read the bishop's mind, as it were&#151;but I
trust this is close to his meaning. The &quot;I&quot; is real, as
is the Thou, but the two are bound together by God. And God is
love. This is what it means to say that God is personal but not a
Person. Love is the very Ground of our Being; but so too is
independence an essential aspect of our Being: indeed it must be,
if love is also, for the one implies the other. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Extrapolating again, it might be suggested that we
worship not God&#151;the word itself would seem to indicate a
Person&#151; but rather perhaps a symbolic X. Maybe we should
offer up our prayers to Love, which in fact is what we do. All
day long the radio blares the message, flooding our homes and our
autos with songs of love and little else&#151;news, sports, and
love: that is the prescribed formula&#151;and our literature,
too, seems preoccupied with the theme. Some call it sex; but is
it really God? What sends the unhappy young man wandering the
lonely streets of night in search of Her? Is it God who sends
him, the Ground of his Being? If God is love we are a pious
nation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We shall not belabor the possible parallels between
Robinson's demythologized Christianity and many of the Eastern or
psychedelic concepts we have already discussed. They should be
obvious. What especially stands out, of course, is the idea of
immanence, and the reader will decide for himself whether the
bishop has managed to slam the door in time. Or has pantheism
slipped in? To many it may appear that the bishop is hanging by
his fingernails over those chasms we mentioned, as far as
transcendence is concerned, and it would be worthwhile to take
one last look at his definition of this term. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seems fair to say that Robinson has made the
term <i>transcendent</i> synonymous with the term <i>unconditional</i>.
Love is a built-in aspect of existence; it is not ours to
command; it is the essence which precedes our existence; it is
the &quot;more&quot; which does not meet the eye and which does
not yield itself to the scrutiny of an empirical science. As the
bishop put it to me: &quot;Here is something before which you
say, yes, this is it. Here I stand, I can no other. I think this <i>is</i>
something in a real sense that confronts one, engages one, from
outside. It's not something one thinks up for oneself. It
clearly, as I see it, is describing how things <i>are</i>. You
say, well, here is something fundamentally true which I cannot
escape.&quot; For example perhaps, one does not think up
breathing for oneself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But some critics might argue that an unconditional
&quot;more&quot; is not really the same as a transcendent
&quot;other,&quot; and &quot;in a real sense&quot; is, after all,
a deceptive phrase; it sounds positive, but actually it weakens
and modifies more than it reinforces&#151;that is to say, it
implies <i>&quot;as if,&quot;</i> not <i>&quot;is.&quot;</i> It
is significant that the bishop did not say simply: &quot;This is
something that confronts one from outside.&quot; Because he did
not say this, and probably could not, it is debatable whether
Robinson was successful in his effort to validate transcendence
for popular theology, since transcendence has always implied
&quot;outside,&quot; &quot;other,&quot; or &quot;separate,&quot;
and the bishop's God displays none of these qualities. It is not
enough to say this God transcends the individual, since
transcendence has always implied something more than just this;
it has implied a divinity that transcends mankind as a
whole&#151;and not in the sense of being unconditional, but
rather in the sense of being separate and superior (at least <i>partly</i>
separate, and wholly superior). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson of course was well aware of this, and it
was precisely this implication he was trying to combat with his
new definition. It might be argued that Robinson did not actually
redefine transcendence; it might be argued that he substituted an
altogether different concept. &quot;Deep,&quot; for example, is
not a redefinition of &quot;tall,&quot; and unconditional, in
this sense, is not a redefinition of transcendent. But this may
be quibbling; substitution and redefinition shade into each
other, and perhaps there is a sense in which the bishop's God
&quot;as it were&quot; transcends us. (&quot;As it were&quot; is
another of the bishop's favorite phrases.) If you think about it
a long while, there will be moments when you say yes&#151;and
moments when you say no, or maybe. It is not an easy concept to
get your mind around; it is, if you like, rather vague (or
mysterious), and you will see perhaps why we objected to talk of
a vague pantheism. Pantheism is very easy. By comparison, one can
well appreciate the frustration of the critic who described
Robinson as a confused man who is confusing others. There are,
however, a great many people who would say that the bishop has
provided them with something other than confusion. From one point
of view, he may have taken away their silver&#151;but returned
them gold. In an era of subjective chaos, he has made religion
meaningful again for untold thousands. While he may well have
scuttled transcendence in its traditional interpretation&#151;may
indeed have lost it altogether&#151;his system does retain the
Western concept of pluralism. And this in the final test could
prove to have more significance even than transcendence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the bishop himself has acknowledged this.
You will recall the argument, derived from Tillich, that atheism
collapses if you define God simply as ultimate reality. Then it
is necessary to debate only the nature of this ultimate reality,
the bishop said. And he added this: &quot;One can only ask what
ultimate reality is like&#151;whether, for instance, in the last
analysis what lies at the heart of things and governs their
working is to be described in personal or impersonal
categories.&quot; That perhaps is the real question, and not
transcendence. That perhaps is the basis of the more fundamental
challenge which is offered to the West by LSD and by Eastern
metaphysics. The bishop of course took the position that ultimate
reality is personal, and this is another way of saying that it is
pluralistic: &quot;love,&quot; &quot;relation,&quot;
&quot;personal&quot;&#151;all these are pluralistic words,
opposed to monism. They preserve the integrity both of Thou and
&quot;I.&quot; If God is love, he cannot be Atman. If God is
personal, there is no One. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We have said, however, that the instant remedy for
atheism contains within it a possible flaw. As Robinson saw it,
&quot;one cannot argue whether ultimate reality exists,&quot; and
we have quoted Tillich's assertion: nobody can say or think that
life has no depth, that life is shallow. But in fact men can and
do assert that ultimate reality does not exist, that life is
shallow and has no depth. Existence, some say, is absurd. Life is
a joke &#151;a rather ghastly one at that&#151;and there is no
ultimate reality in the sense of an unconditional purpose or
meaning. For atheistic existentialists, such as Sartre, there is
no Ground of Being, no unconditional, no primary state of Being
in any sense; not only is there no God, there is no such thing
even as a definite human nature, for existence precedes essence.
And what does this mean? &quot;It means,&quot; said Sartre,
&quot;that, first of all, man exists, turns up, appears on the
scene, and, only afterward, defines himself.&quot; In the
beginning is subjectivity. In the beginning, man is nothing.
&quot;Only afterward will he be something, and he himself will
have made what he will be.... Man is nothing else but what he
makes of himself.&quot; He must choose what he will be, and that
terrible responsibility is his alone. Man, to his horror, is born
free. He is, indeed, &quot;condemned to be free.&quot; He is
&quot;condemned every moment to invent man.&quot; There are no
determinisms. There is, said Sartre, &quot;no human nature for me
to depend on.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;We are alone, with no excuses.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson perhaps recognized his own error, for he
also wrote: &quot;The question of God is the question whether
this depth of being is a reality or an illusion.&quot; And the
next question, then, is obvious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; True or false&#151;how does one decide? How does
one determine whether the Ground of Being is real or not? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is first of all the possibility of rational
proof. But those who hold to this possibility have had many
centuries in which to produce their evidence, and the evidence
has not been universally convincing. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is next the possibility of
revelation&#151;and especially, for the bishop, the possibility
of revelation through Jesus Christ. I asked Robinson why the
radical Christian says that love is the final truth, as opposed
to the humanist who says it ought to be, and the bishop said:
&quot;I think that this is defined and vindicated in Christ. And
personally, unless I saw this in Christ, and really felt that
this was the clue, then there are so many things in our modern
world which would suggest otherwise that I should find it very
difficult to hang on to this. But this is in a sense, I think,
the sort of knot in the thread.&quot; But the knot was tied
almost two thousand years ago, and there are signs today it is
coming undone. The revelation existed when the modern world came
into being, and men ever since have paid less and less heed to
it. Today men have eyes to see, and they do not see; they have
ears to hear, and they do not hear. Or so it might appear to the
church at least. &quot;Often enough,&quot; said Buber, &quot;we
think there is nothing to hear, but long before we have ourselves
put wax in our ears.&quot; So the problem perhaps is basic
enough. How can men be made to look and see, listen and hear? How
can the scales be removed from their eyes and the wax from their
ears? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson's solution was to demythologize, or
redefine, and this for many has been richly rewarding. But is it
enough? In itself, after all, it is rational analysis
again&#151;and this alone has never been enough. It may serve to
illuminate or to justify a truth that has been intuitively
perceived, however vaguely. But what if that perception was
lacking to begin with? Are we not thrown back once more on the
primary necessity for a direct inner experience of the ultimate
reality, which is God and the Ground of our Being? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This issue is implicit in the New Theology's
response to secularization. Many New Theologians have taken
Bonhoeffer to mean that the church should turn exclusively to
this world, becoming secular itself&#151;that religion should be
made &quot;relevant&quot; by involving it full scale in social
and political issues, and, in a more shallow sense, by adapting
it to contemporary mores and the modern idiom (beat prayers, jam
sessions at the altar). But is this what people really want from
religion? Or do they seek instead that intimate, personal
encounter which in turn is the ultimate <i>basis</i> for social
action? Are the secularizers putting the cart before the horse?
In their reaction against otherworldliness, do they threaten a
further diminution of that mystical element for which LSD seems
to demonstrate a widespread hunger? There is no simple answer,
but the problem is there. And so LSD perhaps challenges not only
orthodoxy but also one aspect at least of radical theology. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson himself is not limited to this one aspect;
he is not to be identified with the secularizers
alone&#151;although Altizer has so identified him. Certainly he
has a good deal of sympathy for this school, which derives
largely from Bonhoeffer. But, as he put it to me, &quot;There is
a whole other side which I took over from Tillich, and there is a
whole lot for instance in Teilhard de Chardin, and others, which
I think is equally important.&quot; This other side, of course,
represents the mystical-philosophical approach to
theology&#151;or, in other words, the metaphysical school.
&quot;What I'm trying to do,&quot; Robinson said, &quot;is to
combine this with the sort of thing that the prophets of
secularization are saying, and I don't want to have to choose
between them.&quot; The bishop indeed has shared Saint Thomas'
penchant for synthesis&#151;he has not been an either/or thinker,
and this no doubt explains why some have thought him confused or
confusing. While many of his basic viewpoints were drawn from
mystical philosophy, however, and while mystics such as Tillich
and Buber have been his own inspiration, the bishop in his book
nevertheless took a dim view of mysticism for the average person,
and of mysticism as a solution. He wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our contention has been that God is to be met not by a
    &quot;religious&quot; turning away from the world but in
    unconditional concern for &quot;the other&quot; <i>seen
    through to its ultimate depths....</i> That there are
    veridical experiences of the type usually called
    &quot;mystical&quot; or &quot;religious&quot; no one would be
    so foolish as to deny, and a man may thank God for them as
    St. Paul did for his visions. But the capacity for religious
    or mystical awareness, as for aesthetic or psychic awareness,
    is largely a question of natural endowment. Women, for
    instance, appear to be naturally more religious&#151;and more
    psychic&#151;than men. To make the knowledge of God depend
    upon such experiences is like making it depend on an ear for
    music. There are those who are tone-deaf, and there are those
    who would not claim to have any clearly distinguishable
    &quot;religious&quot; experiences. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Again, in our own conversation, I asked Robinson if
Bonhoeffer was not, among other things, rejecting what the bishop
referred to as churchiness. &quot;Yes,&quot; said Robinson.
&quot;He's also certainly rejecting any view of religion which
sees it just as a compartment of life and sees the church as a
sort of religious club for those who like that sort of
thing&#151;which indeed it very largely is. That is one of the
troubles. It exists to meet the needs of religiously minded
people&#151;which seems to me a great distortion of the real
function of the church, which is much more concerned with the
making holy of the common, with the transformation of the whole
of life, and not simply in providing the same sort of function
that, say, a musical club does for those who like music.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Obviously, as the bishop has interpreted it,
Bonhoeffer's rejection of &quot;religion&quot; is nothing more or
less than a rejection of mysticism in the sense that we have
defined it. The question remains, how does one manage to <i>see</i>
the holy in the common, and how is the whole of life to <i>be</i>
transformed unless there is, to begin with, some inner experience
corresponding to a mystical awareness? You cannot simply tell
people to see the holy, or point it out to them, and no New
Theology, however radical, is going to transform the whole of
life. If people cannot find ultimate reality in Jesus Christ,
they are not going to find it in Tillich. It could be argued that
more churchiness is just what is needed. Robinson of course had
no intrinsic objection to mysticism; on the contrary, he was
merely facing the fact that most people cannot achieve the state.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or could not, the drug movement would say. If
everybody in the world would take LSD tonight, under the proper
conditions, it is possible that tomorrow there would be millions
more of the praying type. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here, then, in its full scope, is LSD's challenge
to New Theology. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for New Theology's own challenge to orthodoxy,
the traditionalists have taken comfort in the fact that Robinson
since publication of his book has more or less dropped that
phrase Ground of Being. The idea seems to be that this was some
sort of capitulation, and a collective sigh of relief was heard.
Robinson indicated to me, however, that he had tended to
&quot;shear off&quot; the phrase simply because &quot;it
obviously seems to cause so much misunderstanding.&quot; A great
many people, he said, &quot;have assumed this is a purely
impersonal phrase and is the enemy of belief in God as in any
sense a personal reality.&quot; That of course is not the way he
interpreted it himself. I asked him if the book still stood, or
if he had changed his viewpoint in any fundamental area. &quot;I
think basically it still stands,&quot; he said. He had not in
fact read the book since it was last in proof. &quot;But I
wouldn't say that radically I have regretted anything I have
written, or changed it.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When they were not denouncing him for heresy, the
bishop's critics tried the opposite tack. After all, he was
saying nothing more than the church itself had always said. It
was old stuff. During a public debate at Wabash, for example,
Professor J. V. Langmead Casserley of Seabury-Western Theological
Seminary declared the bishop was &quot;profoundly in harmony with
the deepest theological opinions of the church.&quot; The bishop
was being honest to God perhaps, but dishonest to history. Well,
the bishop never said his stuff was new. He did say it was not
being communicated&#151;a fact attested to, perhaps, by the
incredible spark-to-tinder response his book produced in the
pews. Robinson has been criticized for fogginess, as noted, and
Casserley charged he had &quot;befuddled the minds of men both
inside and outside the church to a quite unprecedented
degree.&quot; But there was one man at least for whom the
bishop's meaning seemed perfectly clear. And that was Thomas J.
J. Altizer. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a talk I had with him, Altizer had no difficulty
whatever in assessing the bishop&#151;as an opponent. He
identified Robinson as one who was trying desperately to salvage
the core of traditional Christian theology, which Altizer
rejected. It was rather astonishing to find the bishop emerging,
from one point of view, as a kind of Red Cross Knight and
defender of the faith. To mix the metaphor, and possibly to
strain it, he might be described as a man trying to jettison
excess cargo from an aircraft which was dropping perilously close
to those peaks identified on theological charts as Altizer and
Hamilton, Nietzsche and Sartre. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From another point of view, however, it might be
said that Robinson opened the door&#151;and Altizer slipped in. </p>

<h2>l0. The Death of God</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thomas J. J. Altizer, the Young Turk of Christian
theology, had gee-whizzed to fame on the strength of a single
four-letter word. He was holding on to that word for dear life.
And then, for one breathless moment, it appeared as if he might
let it dribble through his fingers. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The word was &quot;dead.&quot; As in &quot;God is
Dead.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The occasion was a symposium at Northwestern
University, in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, where Altizer
appeared on a panel with Walter Kaufmann, the Princeton
philosopher, and Harvey Cox, author of <i>The Secular City</i>.
Altizer had become the most controversial spokesman for the
ultra-radical Death of God theology. Again, this was in 1966,
shortly before my meeting with Bishop Robinson at Wabash, and I
attended the symposium in hopes of discovering just what it was
that Altizer had been trying to say. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nobody seemed certain. As it developed, nobody had
really asked him before. After the symposium I did ask him, and
later I had a lengthy interview with him following his return to
Atlanta and his duties as associate professor of Bible and
religion at Emory University. If nothing else, Altizer made it
perfectly clear exactly what he meant. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He arrived at the Northwestern symposium in a
canary-yellow sport coat, black slacks, ice-blue shirt, flame-red
tie, baby-blue wool socks, and brown brogans. He had tousled
black hair and looked a little like the movie actor Glenn Ford.
When he addressed the audience, however, he no longer looked like
Glenn Ford. He looked and sounded like one of Plato's divine
madmen. He had charisma, and lots of it. And what he said was
pure poetry. Everybody agreed it was poetry, because it was very
beautiful, and nobody could understand it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I apologize for my presence,&quot; he said.
&quot;I'm incapable of speaking about man. I find myself almost
speechless. Almost the only word that may be spoken about man in
our time is a word that attempts to express the darkness of
ourselves. And this darkness is the body of the dead God.... If
faith can but whisper in our world, it can take a step toward
life. And we can never take that step until we truly know that
God is Dead. We can say with thanksgiving, 'God is Dead. Thank
God.'&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not only what Altizer said; it was his
tremulous, Margaret O'Brien way of saying it. A professor winced,
turned and whispered, &quot;How can he bear to do it&#151;strip
himself naked this way?&quot; &quot;He's sick,&quot; said one.
&quot;Inspired,&quot; said another. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer had been described as speaking at times in
mystical overtones, but that did not go far enough. Rather, he
presented the image of a full-fledged, card-carrying
visionary&#151;a profane mystic haunted by an apocalyptic vision
of cosmic dimensions. At one point, responding to a sharply
worded question, he told the audience in Billy Budd-ish
frustration: &quot;Sometimes I feel like a man who stutters and
can't speak. Sometimes I feel like a man in a room where a
foreign and untranslatable language is being spoken&#151;but he
has to speak nevertheless.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As he did speak, his references to the dead God
became even more enigmatic. They were voiced in the present and
future tenses. &quot;God is.&quot; &quot;God will.&quot; As it
turned out later, this was significant. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before the audience, Altizer did tend to express
himself in arcane symbolism. But later, at a student bull
session, a different Altizer took the floor. This was Altizer the
scholar, Altizer the theologian, Altizer the metaphysician. The
vision was switched off, intellect was switched on, and Altizer
himself was no longer obscure; he was instead a thoughtful man
who was doing his best to express an obscure idea: like a
mathematician who has been asked to describe the taste of
peppermint. He was friendly, amusing, intelligent, and eager to
communicate. He knew what he meant; questioned carefully, he said
what he meant&#151;and he did not mean what most people had
seemed to think he meant. Listening to him, it appeared
increasingly ironic that Altizer had somehow come to be
identified with that mainstream phenomenon known as the New
Theology, in so far as that refers to the secularization of the
church and a this-worldly involvement in social problems; it
seemed even more ironic that the New Theology had come to be
identified with Altizer. This was a gigantic error, Altizer
agreed. Grinning, puffing on a fragrant pipe, he explained his
vision. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What it boiled down to was a highly unorthodox
interpretation of the Incarnation: of the Word becoming flesh in
the person of Jesus Christ. What Altizer was talking about was
transcendence, and immanence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We have said it is possible to conceive of God as
both transcendent <i>and</i> immanent, and we recalled the
analogy to the relationship between Shakespeare and the
characters in <i>The Tempest</i>. Shakespeare obviously is
immanent in his characters, since they owe their existence to
him; but he also transcends them, in the sense that they do not
exhaust his being: he has a separate existence above and beyond
them. Altizer began with a fairly traditional view of God
somewhat along these lines, accepting the idea of a
transcendent-immanent divinity. And he also accepted the
Incarnation as a historic fact: God manifesting himself in the
world in the flesh of Jesus. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For years, however, he brooded upon the full
significance of this event. He immersed himself in a study of
Eastern mysticism, Nietzsche, Hegel, William Blake&#151;and he
thought hard about the Incarnation. Then, one day while he was
reading, it came to him. It all fell in place. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Incarnation happened. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So did the Crucifixion. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But not the Resurrection! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This idea is the essence of Altizer's theology. God
had incarnated himself in the body of Jesus; but when Jesus died,
God did not &quot;jump back up into heaven.&quot; He remained in
the world. He is in the world now. What God did, said Altizer,
was &quot;empty himself of transcendence.&quot; He became totally
immanent in the universe. He became part of the universe. But he
did not, immediately, become all of the universe. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At first he was immanent only in Jesus. Since the
death of Jesus he has continued to embed himself deeper and
deeper into the fabric of the universe. No longer transcendent in
any sense, he is in the process even now of becoming ever more
immanent. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jesus, to Altizer, was &quot;the original
Christ.&quot; Christ was that point where God entered the world.
And Altizer retains the word Christ to signify the God who
remains in the world, becoming more and more a part of it. The
word &quot;spirit&quot; might do just as well, said Altizer. But
for various reasons he would prefer to &quot;stick with the word
Christ.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More often than not, however, Altizer in his
conversation spoke neither of Christ nor of spirit. He kept right
on speaking of &quot;God.&quot; When this was called to his
attention, he conceded: &quot;In a certain sense I treat Christ
as God. But the word bears an entirely different meaning from the
dominant meaning of God. That's why I resist the word God.&quot;
He resisted it all evening with little success. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer described the movement toward greater
immanence as an evolutionary, creative process; it is leading
toward a final Christ: an apocalyptic new godhead in which God
will be all there is. Altizer spoke of &quot;a new world that
will dawn at the end of the old world.&quot; He spoke of &quot;a
totally new creation&#151;new man, new world, new life.&quot;
When he speaks of the death of God, said Altizer, he is speaking
of the passage from transcendence to immanence. Eventually the
new and different godhead will be realized, he said. But even
now, before it is realized, man can rejoice in a new sense of
freedom. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Man finds himself in darkness, said Altizer.
&quot;And this darkness is the body of the dead God.&quot; But
once the darkness is recognized for what it is, it can be
accepted. &quot;Only a rotting body in a tomb,&quot; said
Altizer. &quot;It can't bind us to it, once we have known it
truly as an empty darkness. Then, at that moment, we can truly be
liberated from it.&quot; The transcendent power has ended, and
man is free. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shakespeare has entered his own play, Altizer
seemed to be saying. Eventually he will be the play&#151;and then
he will write a final act which incorporates the preceding five
but is wholly different. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I make the Incarnation everything,&quot;
Altizer summed up, adding, necessarily, that he gives the rest of
the Bible &quot;only a very limited allegiance.&quot; His
interpretation of the Incarnation was entirely consistent, he
said. &quot;Christ has come, and you hurl him back into heaven.
This is a complete betrayal of Christ. Only by seeing God's death
in Christ can we be true to Christ.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the bull session, the Northwestern students
fired questions at Altizer, and, as they did so, it was possible
to trace many of his concepts back to their sources. A wholly
immanent God, after all, is scarcely a new idea: it is the idea
of Eastern pantheism, pure and simple, and Altizer conceded he
was talking pantheism. The God of the East is &quot;very
real,&quot; he said, and &quot;infinitely more realistic&quot;
than the traditional Western God. One could opt for this God, he
said. But there is one important sense in which Altizer would
distinguish his position from the Eastern view, and we shall
return to this point in a later chapter. Briefly, for now,
Altizer's theology suggests that the cosmic process is
evolutionary&#151;that it is leading up to something&#151;while
Eastern metaphysics supposedly rejects the evolutionary
hypothesis. The East &quot;looks backward to a primordial
totality&quot; (according to Altizer), and Altizer on the other
hand &quot;looks forward&quot; to an eschatological totality
which is utterly transformed and aware of itself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer of course had taken his God-is-Dead tag
from Nietzsche, and the new sense of freedom echoed Blake's
mystical emphasis upon man: his delight in man's liberty and his
rejection of any transcendent authority, his absorption with
Jesus and his denial of God. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer acknowledged his debt to Blake and
Nietzsche. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There also seemed nothing new in the idea of an
evolving spirit. That derived from Hegel, as Altizer was pleased
to point out. But it also sounded very much like Henri Bergson's
vital force. As a matter of fact, it sounded even more like
Teilhard de Chardin's view of the universe. Again, we shall have
more to say about this in another chapter, and we shall limit
ourselves for the moment to only one aspect of Teilhard's
metaphysics. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Teilhard, a Jesuit paleontologist, had proposed an
evolutionary theory based upon the increasing complexification of
inert matter. He proposed that mankind was moving toward the
realization of a new godhead which Teilhard referred to as the
Omega point. And he saw in this process the hand of God. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The key to it all: the Incarnation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Teilhard described evolution as &quot;a prodigious
biological operation&#151;that of the Redeeming
Incarnation.&quot; He added: &quot;As early as in St. Paul and
St. John we read that to create, to fulfill and to purify the
world is, for God, to unify it by uniting it organically with
himself.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how would God unify the world? Teilhard
answered: &quot;By partially immersing himself in things, by
becoming 'element,' and then, from this point of vantage in the
heart of matter, assuming the control and leadership of what we
now call evolution.&quot; This immersion, said Teilhard, was
through Christ&#151;who &quot;put himself in the position
(maintained ever since) to subdue under himself . . . the general
ascent of consciousness into which he inserted himself.... And
when he has gathered everything together and transformed
everything, he will close in upon himself and his conquests,
thereby rejoining, in a final gesture, the divine focus he has
never left. Then, as St. Paul tells us, God shall be all in
all.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I asked Altizer about this, and Altizer
acknowledged his IOU to Teilhard. (He suggested later that I may
have overwritten the amount a bit, but I doubt it.) He largely
accepted Teilhard's view, Altizer said. It represented &quot;the
most important theological work in a long time.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That seemed to leave Altizer with little to call
his own, apart from his unique view of the Incarnation. Even
there, he appeared to be separated from Teilhard by a single
word: <i>&quot;partially.&quot;</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The students jumped on what was left. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;That which was God,&quot; said Altizer,
&quot;will finally be real and present again in a wholly new
form&#151;if you like, in Teilhard's Omega point.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, then, God wasn't really dead, was he? Altizer
more or less conceded than &quot;transformed&quot; might be more
accurate&#151;that the passage from transcendence to immanence
meant &quot;a totally new form of the godhead.&quot; &quot;So we
shouldn't panic?&quot; asked a student. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Well,&quot; said Altizer, &quot;the Christian
church should. Because I'm saying that everything they stand for
is dead.&quot; Pressed again on his word choice, Altizer said of
God: &quot;I think he's dead in a very crucial way . . . in his
original divine form. Everything the Christian has called God is
dead.&quot; All this sounded remarkably close to the minimal
concession that theologians had been trying to wring from Altizer
for some time. God lives, but man's concept of him is outdated.
In my subsequent interview with him, after his return to Georgia,
Altizer picked up his word and ran with it again: a less drastic
word might fail to make the point, he said&#151;and, as a
newspaperman, I could certainly appreciate this. Suppose that
first story coming out of Atlanta had begun: &quot;A theologian
here says God is immanent.&quot; The story would never have come
out of Atlanta in the first place; the complex and productive
arguments behind the catchword might never have seen the light,
and Altizer, at best, would be an obscure Dixie heretic. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The word was not important really. What seemed to
upset the Northwestern students far more was Altizer's
fundamentally apocalyptic view of the world. Once understood,
Altizer appeared to stand in direct contradiction to the radical
theology his name had come to dominate&#151;because the main
thrust of that theology had probably been messianic and
pragmatic. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Radical theology is a big tent, and it has
sheltered other theologians who also have said that God is Dead.
But these others have not meant that God is Dead in Altizer's
sense&#151;nor indeed have they really meant that God is Dead in
any sense. Some of the people who are associated with this phrase
have meant to say simply that the <i>word</i> God is dead; they
have abandoned the word as a semantic wreck which means all
things to all men, and they have tried to clarify the concept
through linguistic analysis. Others have studied God talk as a <i>cultural</i>
phenomenon, asserting that man creates God in his own image, so
to speak&#151;that his idea of God is molded by his cultural
prejudices&#151;and they have tried to identify the real divinity
which exists perhaps behind the man-made idols. Still others have
meant that God is <i>hidden</i> or mysterious, as Job found him
to be, beyond the power of human comprehension, and they have
called upon us to abandon the vain effort to understand God
metaphysically, recommending instead that we do God's work by
seeking social justice here on earth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still another school appears to derive its
inspiration largely from Bonhoeffer. Its advocates speak of God
as <i>absent</i> in the sense that modern man no longer is
capable of experiencing God: the reality of God has somehow gone
dead on him. But absence is not the same as death, and Altizer's
fellow radical William Hamilton, for example, has referred to
&quot;our waiting for God,&quot; implying that God perhaps will
one day return: it may be that he has simply withdrawn for a
time, in order that we may achieve our adulthood in Bonhoeffer's
&quot;world come of age.&quot; In one of his essays, Hamilton
said he followed Bonhoeffer in rejecting <i>religion</i>&#151;which
is to say, &quot;any system of thought or action in which God or
the gods serve as fulfiller of needs or solver of problems.&quot;
Hamilton described radical theology as a movement from the church
to the world&#151;a letting go of God's hand, as it were. And he
added: &quot;This combination of a certain kind of God-rejection
with a certain kind of world-affirmation is the point where I
join the death of God movement.... If God is not needed, if it is
to the world and not God that we repair for our needs and
problems, then perhaps we may come to see that he is to be
enjoyed and delighted in.... Our waiting for God, our
godlessness, is partly a search for a language and a style by
which we might be enabled to stand before him once again,
delighting in his presence.&quot; In other words, we won't come
home again until we have made it all by ourselves in the big
city, or rather the big cosmos&#151;and then won't Father be
proud of us? Then we can sit on the front-porch swing together
and trade stories, man to man, and really get to know each other.
No more of this writing home for money; enough of this juvenile
dependency relationship: Andy Hardy is growing up. We are falling
into parody here, but it is not our intention to poke fun; we are
merely trying to communicate a rather difficult idea, somewhat in
the manner of an editorial-page cartoonist. Hamilton, in any
case, has probably been the best-known Death of God theologian
next to Altizer, and Hamilton clearly has not been saying the
same thing that Altizer has been saying. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer really stands by himself. Only he has taken
a position which might be construed to imply an actual Death of
God, and even in his case a stretch of the imagination is
required to justify that word Death. He is in fact talking about
the Transformation of God. Nevertheless, Altizer has been the
only Death of God theologian to propose a really radical
metaphysics. He has been the only one to suggest that an actual <i>change</i>
has occurred in the nature or ontology of God. The orthodox
atheist says that God never existed in the first place. Bishop
Robinson and the demythologizers say we ought to change our ideas
about God. Altizer alone says that God himself has changed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer also rejects the idea that theology has
anything to do with social action. In fact he scoffs at the idea,
and he ridicules the secularizers who are trying to make the
church &quot;relevant.&quot; (&quot;Suddenly the church had
something to do.&quot;) He is not against good works, of course;
but he feels that the secularizers are simply putting old wine
into new bottles, and Altizer wants a new wine. He can argue, and
does, that good works have nothing to do with the relevance of
the church; he can argue, and does, that the business of
theologians is theology; he can argue, and does, that only he and
a few others have been doing theology. Harvey Cox is a physician,
Altizer is a metaphysician. Only Altizer has been asking ultimate
questions about the nature of God and reality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The secularizers have been responding to history
and to social forces, and many people, missing his meaning, have
supposed that Altizer is doing the same thing. They interpret his
message as a kind of existential reaction to the modern world and
the impact of technology; they think he is this-worldly, as the
secularizers are. But that is wrong. Altizer did not start with
the world, he said. He started with his vision. That is what he
is talking about, and that is what concerns him: not the world as
such, but a vision of the world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer at Northwestern fulminated against
otherworldliness. He implied he was this-worldly, since after all
he had equated God with this world. It seemed fair, however, to
put him in his own category and describe him instead as
inner-worldly. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He told the Northwestern students that civil rights
was a &quot;phony nineteenth-century issue&quot; as far as church
relevance was concerned. In fact, he said, since divine authority
had collapsed (since the transcendent deity was dead), there was
absolutely no basis left for moral decision-making. &quot;A
Christian can't make decisions on Viet Nam,&quot; he said. Nor
had a Christian much to hope for at the moment. There was, said
Altizer, no messianic hope for &quot;this world, this history,
this society.&quot; There was only the apocalyptic hope for
&quot;the total transformation of all things.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Suppose I accept your dead God?&quot; said a
co-ed. &quot;Where do I get my Brownie points?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer could offer her only Omega points&#151;and
a sense of freedom to do something or other. Whatever she wanted
to, apparently. He did not offer the God-is-love message of
Bishop Robinson and the secularizers. In several hours, in fact,
the word love never came up. Just that other word. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer returned to Atlanta, and we later had the
following conversation: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Let me see if I understand your viewpoint
correctly, from what you said the other night. You believe, do
you not, that there once was a transcendent God? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Yes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Was this God wholly transcendent, or was he also
immanent in the world? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Both transcendent and immanent. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Did he create the world? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. This gets more difficult theologically. I do not
believe in a literal creation or creation story. Frankly, I
haven't worked this out. It's merely tentative. But I think in
terms of a kind of evolution of the cosmos. There was an original
totality in which all things were one&#151;no separation between
nature, man, and God. And out of this totality there evolved the
world or the cosmos as a distinct entity&#151;and also God. I
think in a certain sense God appears as creator in conjunction
with the world's coming to exist apart from God. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. As I understand it, you believe God emptied
himself of transcendence and became immanent in the
world&#151;that he incarnated himself in the person of Jesus.
That sounds orthodox, to a point. But you stop with the
Incarnation. You reject the Resurrection. You say, &quot;God did
not jump back up into heaven.&quot; You say he stayed right here
in the world after the Crucifixion. Is that correct? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Correct. I believe the fullness, the totality of
God passed into Christ, moving ever more deeply and fully and
comprehensively into the world, flesh, consciousness, and
experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Why did God decide to do this? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. He didn't decide. I understand the Incarnation
as implicit and essential in the whole process of cosmic
movement. There was no arbitrary point where a decision was
reached. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. So God is no longer transcendent but is immanent
right now in the world? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. That's right.... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. But in what is he immanent? In mankind? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. I wouldn't say only mankind. As I told you at
Northwestern, I reverence Teilhard's vision and largely accept
it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. By that, I take it you mean God is immanent in
the cosmos as a whole? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Really yes, in the entire cosmos. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You speak of Jesus as the original Christ. Do
you mean by that there have been other, latter-day Christs? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Originally the Incarnation was in the man Jesus.
And then, following the Crucifixion, Christ progressively enters
the fullness of history and experience, ever more fully and
comprehensively becoming actual in the world . . . a forward
movement . . . Christ becoming ever more actual, ever more real,
ever more incarnate. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You mean this is an evolutionary process that
isn't finished yet? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. I like to think of this immanence itself as a
gradual process. God once was real and actual as a transcendent
lord. He negated himself. Nevertheless, his epiphany or
manifestation as lord continues to linger in human experience,
and it has a certain reality in that experience. I call this the
dead body of God. It's real in human experience. And it will
continue to be real until it is totally negated by the total
dawning of the incarnate Christ. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You mean there are parts of the cosmos in which
Christ is not yet wholly incarnate? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Yes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. All this sounds rather like pantheism. Is it? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. I think it is . . . in the same sense that
Teilhard's vision is. In the cosmic process, it's a kind of
dynamic pantheism&#151; God ever becoming other than he was in
the past&#151;but nevertheless pantheism in that God eventually
will be all in all. Call it a dynamic-process pantheism. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Could your immanent God in any sense be
interpreted to mean the Holy Ghost? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Possibly. I'd almost be willing to use the word
spirit. I'd be willing. In part I do. It's just that this word
spirit is so kicked around these days. I'd rather stick with the
word Christ. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. But doesn't all this say something entirely
different from God is dead? You keep speaking of God in the
present tense and the future tense. You agreed at Northwestern, I
believe, that transformed&#151;completely transformed&#151;was
perhaps more accurate than dead. That it was the church's concept
of God that was utterly dead. Isn't that what you said at
Northwestern? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Well, I also want to say the transcendent lord
is dead. He's become totally immanent, totally flesh, totally
world. If I just speak of transformation, I fear the whole point
will be lost. I'm really saying that the God a Christian prays to
and worships is dead. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Dead? You start with a transcendent God and you
end up with an immanent God. It seems to me you've killed the
adjective, not the noun. The noun is God, and the noun remains. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Yes. All right. But it doesn't remain in the
sense that it still is what it was before. That which God has
become is wholly other. And there is, to my knowledge, no form of
Christian doctrine that admits or asserts this&#151;that God has
decisively transformed himself. I think God as God has died, and
God has passed into Christ. And he lives in Christ . . . but only
lives in Christ himself. If you like, God the father is dead. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Would you call yourself an atheist? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Yes. I do. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. The question arises, how do you know all this? I
believe you have stated that it came to you one day while you
were reading in the University of Chicago library. Could you
describe the nature of your experience? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. That must be about ten years ago now. It was the
summer of 1955, I guess. I was reading Erich Heller's essay on
Nietzsche and Rilke. It was a very intense personal experience.
I'd been thinking about these things for years, of course.
Suddenly I was overwhelmed.... I felt it. I sensed it. And once
having sensed it, I've never been able to lose that sense. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. I assume this wasn't something you arrived at by
a purely rational process, from empirical evidence. Would it be
fair to call it a revelation? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. I'm afraid that would mislead too many people. I
think this theological position is simply a consistent
consequence of thinking fully and radically about the meaning of
the Incarnation. Once you grant that God fully and finally became
man in Jesus Christ, you can largely think through this whole
thing. Also, it's rooted in what I believe to be modern and
contemporary Christian experience and thinking. And I employ
people like Blake and Nietzsche as spokesmen for this radical
Christian vision. I base my work on theirs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You often speak of your vision. Wasn't this
really a personal vision you had? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Let's put it this way. I believe there does in
fact exist a great body of materials of various kinds that
reflect and embody a modern radical Christian vision. For
example, the works of William Blake. I haven't had these visions.
I'm no visionary. I seek to be an interpreter of them. Then
there's also Hegel's logic as a conceptual expression of the same
thing. You can build on the vision and think it through. Hegel
allows you to see how Blake's vision is really a consistent
resolution of the Christian faith. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. But you didn't start with Hegel. Wouldn't you
say this understanding of yours came originally from a
non-rational source? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Oh yes. Every kind of understanding comes
originally from a source other than the empirical, the rational.
I'd include Freud and Marx in that category. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Would it be fair, then, to describe your vision
as basically mystical in nature? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. There is a higher vision; or, if you like, a
radically profane mystical vision. There is such a thing as a
modern mystical vision, yes. But it's not the same as traditional
[otherworldly] mysticism. It's radically profane. It's directed
to the here and now&#151;to life, flesh, energy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You told the students the other night you
couldn't help them make up their minds on Viet Nam and other
issues. You said your view provided no basis for moral
decision-making. What did you mean? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Well, basically this. My view does not lead to
an ethical system or set of moral laws. I don't think anyone can
think responsibly about ethical problems today. Man has lost the
ability. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You said civil rights was a phony
nineteenth-century issue. What did you mean by that? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. The problem itself, it seems to me, is basically
a matter of a group of people, Negroes, entering bourgeois,
middle-class society. And that basically is an eighteenth- or
nineteenth-century problem. It's an old problem, not a problem
peculiar to the twentieth century. I think the church has falsely
prided itself on being able to speak relevantly on this issue,
when it's not really a contemporary issue at all. Further, we are
now moving into a phase of the problem that's highly technical
and modern. And as we do, the church will have increasingly less
and less to say. It will have to be solved by technicians
basically&#151;by economists and sociologists. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You mean the church shouldn't speak out on the
issue? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. No, that's not the point. The church should not
pride itself on being relevant. These church people congratulate
themselves. They say, &quot;See how relevant the church is.&quot;
And I think that's a great illusion. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Are you saying there's no teleological or
ultimate basis for any kind of a morality at all? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. All I'm saying is, as far as I can see right
now, there is no source of moral or human insight into
contemporary human and social problems. This is a period of
terrible darkness we're going through. Either there is no basis
for morality or I just can't see it. Nobody else can see it
either. But I think it will come. I hope it will. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Shouldn't clergymen involve themselves in civil
rights marches? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Oh sure, sure. But we've reached the point
already where there aren't going to be any civil rights marches.
There won't be any role for churchmen to play. Their basic job
was to identify the problem, to attract public attention. And now
they've done that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. And now they have another job? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. That's the great problem. What is that job? I
think the church has to be totally reformed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Until you came along, the mainstream of
Christian upheaval seemed partly at least a reaction to social
forces&#151;Bonhoeffer reacting to the Nazis, Cox to
urbanization, Robinson to secularization. The reformers seemed to
be calling for social involvement and more or less suspending
judgment on the fine points of theology. That is, they seemed to
start with the world. But you seem to start with this inner
vision of yours. Is that a fair statement? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Yes. It's fair to say I started with the vision
rather than the world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. And your vision should in no way be interpreted
as a call to social action, to solve the problems of the world? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. That's right. That's not for me. But I don't
want to say it can't involve social action. Each one must find
his own way. It's a new kind of freedom if you like. This is why
the Death of God is pretty crucial. There's no longer any kind of
divine law to follow. It's no longer there. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. How would you differentiate yourself from people
like Harvey Cox and Bishop Robinson, who say Christians should
seek God by involving themselves directly in the problems of the
world? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. The people I call secularists, they're basically
church reformers. They're reacting to a form of Christian
religiosity which has turned itself completely away from our
world. They want basically to restructure the form of the church,
to make the church relevant. They're not concerned with
transforming the heart of the Christian gospel. They think that's
the same, and that's given, always. I myself, and Hamilton and
others, belong to a radical group who believe the very heart of
the Christian center has got to be transformed. The transcendent
God the church has worshiped is no more. One difference is, Cox
is not really a theologian. He's not interested in constructing a
theological vision or system. Robinson, too. I'm concerned with a
full theological understanding of contemporary faith. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. In other words, you're more metaphysical? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Yes. Except that word is such a . . . it makes
people see red. I'm not a Thomist or anything like that. But I am
concerned with an ultimate vision, with a full understanding of
faith in the world today. Teilhard was metaphysical in this
sense. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. As one of the students asked the other night,
&quot;Where do I get my Brownie points?&quot; What good does your
vision do, and what's in it for me? Isn't it just morbid
introspection, this naming of the darkness? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. I think it's liberating to know God is Dead.
Otherwise, inevitably, consciously or unconsciously, we will look
upon reality as being something alien. Something we can't really
know. We'll be victims of it, slaves of it, because it's
mysterious. To know God is Dead is to be liberated from the
threat of an unknown world, the threat of mystery. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. What is the nature of the light you say you see
burning beyond the darkness? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. That dawns in accordance with the degree with
which darkness is unveiled. And it's a light that makes possible
freedom from oppression right now. To the extent that we're
liberated from darkness, we are able to give ourselves to life.
And life itself becomes light. Darkness becomes light. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. This ultimate consummation we're moving
toward&#151;is the nature of it predestined? Or is the
evolutionary process creative, in the Bergsonian sense? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Something like the latter. Except that
everything that happens in the world will be a part of that final
Omega point. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You said the other night that God in a certain
sense remains transcendent. What did you mean? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. We were speaking in the context of Judaism. I
think the Jew can indeed know a transcendent God. The Jew lives
in a kind of eternal covenant with God, and he can preserve this
because he lives in exile&#151;because he is not totally involved
in our history. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. How can this be? Are you saying there are two
Gods, a Jewish God who's alive and a Christian God who's Dead? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. The Jew actually is in communion with that
ancient epiphany of God&#151;has preserved and perpetuated that
moment in faith. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. But you said that was over. Are you saying Jews
worship a God who isn't there&#151;a false God? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. It's a false God as far as the Christian is
concerned. But I see no reason for the Christian to attack it as
such. What must be attacked are the forms of Judaism that
maintain themselves within Christianity. That's the real danger. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. But is it a false God as far as the Jew is
concerned? Are you simply saying the Jew has a right to worship
as he pleases? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. No. I think It's possible for the Jew actually
to be in communion with this God. Christians must be totally
immersed in history. Jews don't have to be. They're in exile. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. I think there was another sense in which you
said God remains transcendent. You were debating the point with a
philosophy major, and finally you agreed with him. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Oh! The problem there was, he was using
transcendent in a different sense&#151;to refer to something
beyond the given, beyond the brute actuality of experience. He
was using it in terms of vision. That's in a sense transcendent.
In that sense, everything I say is transcendental. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer said he represents a far more basic
challenge to orthodox Christianity than the secularizers do, and
no doubt he does &#151;for he represents that influx of Eastern
ideas we talked about: he represents pantheism. And pantheism is
in the air, no question about that. The doctrine of transcendence
is challenged today as never before, and in Altizer's
theology&#151;as in LSD cultism&#151;Eastern immanence is given
full and final expression. In one of his articles, Altizer called
upon the American theologian to &quot;cast off his German
tutors&quot; and &quot;open himself both to the religious world
of the East and to the deeper sensibility of the Western
present.&quot; He added: &quot;From the East we may once more
learn the meaning of the sacred.... We can encounter in the East
a form of the sacred which Christianity has never known, a form
which is increasingly showing itself to be relevant to our
situation.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Obviously, the leap to the East is just as evident
in radical theology as it is in the drug movement, at least in so
far as this implies a leap from transcendence to
immanence&#151;and if Altizer has been the only important
theologian so far to embrace pantheism without reservation, less
radical radicals have been embracing it with reservations. On a
superficial level at least, it is not much of a jump from
Robinson's position to Altizer's (which is not to imply that
Altizer derives from Robinson; in fact, Altizer was publishing
his views for a non-popular reader ship several years before <i>Honest
to God</i> saw print), and radical theology on the whole can be
characterized essentially as a movement in the direction of
immanence. It is significant perhaps that Harvey Cox, that
squarest of all the radicals, was able to defend transcendence at
Northwestern only in a very limited way. He suggested it was
&quot;too early&quot; to foreclose the possibility of a
transcendent God; the discussion, he said, should &quot;remain
open.&quot; It could be that man is simply incapable of answering
the question one way or the other. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Once the shock effect has worn off, the Death of
God slogan may lose much of its appeal, and Altizer perhaps will
suffer an eclipse. Once understood, his apocalyptic message is
not likely to capture the imagination of this messianic Peace
Corps generation, and his unique view of the Incarnation is
subject to considerable criticism. To some degree at least,
Altizer has owed his success to the fact that few people have
actually grasped his meaning&#151;the attacks against him have
not been well informed&#151;and, from one point of view, the best
way to attack him is to explain him fully. But the loss of an
unfortunate slogan will not put an end to the radical examination
of transcendence, and Altizer's path to immanence is not the only
one. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer is both in and out of the radical
mainstream. He is in it so far as he leans toward immanence; he
is out of it so far as he rejects the messianic hope for this
world in the here and now. Particularly is he out of it in his
apparent rejection (or neglect) of a primary essence or condition
of Being which might provide the basis for an ethical system.
This essence or condition has meanwhile been given its due by the
drug movement and by the bishop of Woolwich&#151;and it also is
central to that emerging phenomenon which is sometimes described
as humanistic psychology. </p>

<h2>11. Humanistic psychology</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is said that Freud had an almost pathologic fear
of metaphysics. According to Jung, Freud was appalled by the
&quot;occult&quot; implications he encountered in his exploration
of the human psyche. Probing ever deeper into the mysteries of
the unconscious region, he heard whispers perhaps from that
unseen world William James talked about&#151;and they frightened
him. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Freud confessed to him, said Jung, &quot;that it
was necessary to make a dogma of his sexual theory because this
was the sole bulwark of reason against a possible 'outburst of
the black flood of occultism.&quot;' Consider, for example, the
idea of intra-uterine memories, or recollections of life in the
womb. If carried further this might suggest the possibility at
least of pre-uterine memories&#151;which in turn might lend some
support to the Eastern doctrine of reincarnation. Freud refused
to consider such implications, and this necessarily resulted in
his negative attitude toward the unconscious, which he regarded
as a sort of garbage heap for man's brute instincts. As a
consequence, said Jung, psychology became for the most part
&quot;the science of conscious contents, measured as far as
possible by collective standards.&quot; But suppose for a moment
that the unconscious is something more than this. What if it is
in fact man's link to ultimate reality and the Ground of his
Being? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Psychology has finally started to consider this
possibility, urged on in part by psychedelic evidence. In a
pioneering study, humanistic psychologist Abraham H. Maslow
proposed that his fellow psychologists move <i>Toward a
Psychology of Being</i>, and Maslow's unorthodox theories have
recently inspired something of a Freud is Dead movement. The
development is comparable in many ways to the radical upheaval in
theology, and Maslow might well be described as the Bonhoeffer or
Robinson of psychology. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What does this mean, a psychology of Being? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Maslow began by agreeing in a sense with Robinson
and disagreeing with Sartre. He began with the assertion that
every man has <i>&quot;an essential biologically based inner
nature.&quot;</i> This inner nature &quot;is to some degree
'natural,' intrinsic, given, and, in a certain limited sense,
unchangeable, or, at least, unchanging.&quot; (That is to say, it
is unconditional&#151;from Robinson's viewpoint, transcendent.)
Moreover, it is not bad or evil: it is either neutral in
character or positively good. Man therefore would do well to
discover and develop it; rather than suppress it, he should
follow it: he should live his life according to its dictates.
Psychology likewise should acknowledge it and seek to understand
it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Freudian psychology is preoccupied with pathology;
it is primarily a sick psychology, or a psychology of sickness.
But it fails to define health. Or rather it tends simply to
equate healthy behavior with successful adjustment to the social
environment, nothing more, and it regards conscience as a sort of
learned response: an internalization of one's &quot;shall&quot;
and &quot;shall not&quot; parents. It is situational and
subjective. It does not suggest the existence of any values,
goals, or ideals in any sense absolute, objective, or
unconditional, and it does not provide for the possibility of an
ultimate reality or ultimate state of Being. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand, Being psychology is a psychology
of health. It defines healthy behavior in terms of successful
adjustment to one's essential inner nature, and it regards
conscience as the &quot;unconscious or preconscious&quot;
perception of that nature. It affirms, of course, the existence
(or potential existence) of an ultimate reality or state of
Being, and it says, in effect, &quot;to thine own Self be
true.&quot; It does not ask what men do: it asks what they should
do. It asks what men are, but it also asks what men might be and
should become. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Being psychology indicates that man has a built-in
potential, as it were, like the oak which is hidden in the acorn,
and conscience is the intuitive awareness of that potential. The
Freudian superego may also exist, but its demands are imposed
from outside: from the society and the culture, transmitted by
the parents. The conscience of Being, by comparison, is
intrinsic; its demands are imposed from within, by the essential
inner nature: it is an inner voice which insists that we be true
to that nature, true to the future, true to the truth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Being psychology, or B-psychology, is different
from Deficiency psychology, or D-psychology. D-psychology studies
sick people whose basic needs have not been satisfied&#151;who
are afflicted, so to speak, with psychic deficiency diseases.
B-psychology studies healthy people whose basic needs have been
satisfied&#151; and who therefore can devote their energies to
life, to the world, and to growth: to the actualization of their
essential inner natures. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Maslow developed his theories in part by studying a
class of healthy people he described variously as meta-motivated,
growth-dominated, and self-actualizing. He also referred to this
type as inner-determined rather than outer-determined, recalling
the sociologist David Riesman's distinction between the
inner-directed individualist and the other-directed conformist.
He said further that self-actualizing people appear to be capable
of a special kind of love and a special kind of cognition. These
he termed B-love and B-cognition, as opposed to D-love and
D-Cognition, the letters again standing for Being on the one hand
and Deficiency on the other. What is more, he said, a capacity
for B-love and B-cognition will sometimes enable a
self-actualizer to achieve a special kind of experience&#151;an
intense, if fleeting, moment of utter joy and complete
fulfillment. This Maslow called a &quot;peak experience.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; D-love is a selfish love in which the lover seeks
primarily to satisfy his own needs; in short, it is I-It love.
B-love is unselfish, non-possessive admiration for the Being of
another person; in short, it is I-Thou love. Similarly,
D-cognition can be summed up here as the I-It mode of perception
and understanding, while B-cognition refers to an I-Thou view of
the world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In B-cognition during a peak experience, said
Maslow, an object is not perceived in terms of use, purpose, or
relation to anything else; it is perceived as a whole. &quot;It
is seen as if it were all there was in the universe, as if it
were all of Being, synonymous with the universe.&quot; The
B-cognizer becomes totally absorbed with the object to the
exclusion of all else, and he admires it without comparing it,
evaluating it, judging it, or desiring to possess it; above all,
he does not <i>rubricize</i> the object, which means to say he
does not attempt to classify it or put it in a category with
other objects. The B-cognizer, moreover, is relatively
&quot;ego-transcending, self-forgetful, ego-less.&quot; He also
is non-motivated in terms of future action; he regards the peak
experience as a &quot;self-validating&quot; end in itself and not
as the means to some future end. A &quot;very characteristic
disorientation to time and space&quot; occurs, and the B-cognizer
finds himself, subjectively, outside of time and space. He is
&quot;most here-now, most free of the past and of the
future.&quot; He is therefore &quot;non-striving, non-needing,
non-wishing.&quot; His perception is nondualistic, and he thus
denies the existence of evil&#151;or views it rather as
&quot;only a partial phenomenon, a product of not seeing the
world whole and unified.&quot; Being as such is good, or neutral.
And finally, the peak experience is beyond
abstractions&#151;including verbal abstractions. It cannot really
be put into words, since it is after all a view of the whole, and
words cannot express the whole. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; B-psychology's description of a healthy person's
peak experience sounds very much, of course, like James's
description of mystical religious experience, Buber's description
of I-Thou experience, the drug cultist's description of
psychedelic experience, and the Zen Buddhist's description of
satori. Maslow's essential inner nature, as we have already
indicated, sounds very much like Tillich's Ground of Being and
Bishop Robinson's transcendent or unconditional God. And the
B-psychologist's attitude toward the unconscious would certainly
appear to support the view of James and Jung. &quot;Because the
roots of ill health were found first in the unconscious,&quot;
wrote Maslow, &quot;it has been our tendency to think of the
unconscious as bad, evil, crazy, dirty or dangerous, and to think
of the primary processes as <i>distorting</i> the truth. But now
that we have found these depths to be also the source of
creativeness, of art, of love, of humor and play, and even of
certain kinds of truth and knowledge, we can begin to speak of a
healthy unconscious, of healthy regressions. . . . We can now go
into primary process cognitions for certain kinds of knowledge,
not only about the self but also about the world.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Maslow, unlike Robinson, did not attempt to say in
so many words what man's essential inner nature might be. But a
clue to his thought is provided perhaps by his expression of
wonder at &quot;the mystery of communication between alone-nesses
via, e.g., intuition and empathy, love and altruism,
identification with others, and homonomy in general.&quot; Maslow
added: &quot;We take these for granted. It would be better if we
regarded them as miracles to be explained.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The scientist Lecomte du Nouy expressed the same
idea in his book <i>Human Destiny</i> when he pointed out that
&quot;the appearance of moral and spiritual ideas remains an
absolute mystery.&quot; How, then, are we to account for our
&quot;unaccountable aspirations&quot;? The scientific unbeliever
insists upon cause and effect &#151;and then refuses to
acknowledge any cause creating such effects as love, conscience,
charity, and sacrifice. The cause is denied because it cannot be
seen. Thus, as physicist David Bohm has noted, nineteenth-century
positivists such as Mach held that the idea of atoms was
meaningless and &quot;nonsensical&quot; because atoms could not
then be observed. But even science will sometimes accept the
evidence of things not seen, as in the case of the outer planets.
The existence of some unseen planet was first suspected because
of perturbations in the orbit of Uranus; when a proper telescope
was brought to bear, giant Neptune swam into view&#151;and Pluto
later was similarly discovered. So what would happen if we were
to focus our attention on the phenomena of love and morality,
searching in the same way for the source of these perturbations?
What might swim into view in this case? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Evidence of an essential inner nature led Maslow to
reconsider the possibility that mankind might be able to develop
a humanistic morality or scientific ethic. As it is, Western
morality tends to be legalistic and authoritarian; our basic
rules of conduct are handed down from above, as it were, in the
form of commandments, on tablets of stone, and we are expected to
obey them without asking questions. Thou shalt not kill, for
example. No doubt that is a very good law, and there is probably
a very good reason for it&#151;but we are not told what the
reason is. Similarly, no particular reason is given for the less
basic rules of conduct which are imposed upon us by mundane
authority. As a general proposition, all in all, we are expected
to behave this way or that way because God said so, or our
parents said so, or Congress said so, or Emily Post said so. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The system does work, in a fashion, if we sense
that the laws in question are for some reason good ones. Thus
most of us feel intuitively that the law against killing is a
good law, which explains why it has remained on the books for so
many years in so many lands, and most of us therefore do not kill
other people, unless of course we are told to by Congress or the
President. But the system breaks down too, and especially so in
an age of empiricism when people develop the disturbing habit of
demanding a reason for everything. We are distressed, for
example, when criminals and juvenile delinquents band together in
gangs, make their own rules, and refuse to honor the laws of
society. We wonder why it happens. But society itself is a gang
&#151;it is simply a very big gang&#151;and its rules are no more
sacrosanct than the Mafia's unless some valid reason can be
produced to recommend them: a reason, preferably, which will
demonstrate that the rules as such are grounded in the very
nature of things. This is why men have dreamed of discovering a
&quot;natural law&quot; which is grounded in the nature of Being
itself, demonstrably true and irrefutable: a law which no man
could possibly deny, having once understood it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such a law indeed is central to the Tibetan concept
of <i>Dharmakaya</i>. As the Evans-Wentz edition of the <i>Tibetan
Book of the Dead</i> tells us: <i>&quot;Dharmakaya</i> is the
norm of all existence, the standard of truth, the measure of
righteousness, the good law; it is that in the constitution of
things which makes certain modes of conduct beneficial and
certain other modes detrimental.&quot; In the East, for instance,
human compassion is a matter of elementary logic based upon the
supposedly monistic character of mankind. &quot;When you're cut,
I bleed. Therefore, I had better see to it that you are not
cut.&quot; In the West the idea of a natural law can be traced
back to Plato's assertion that virtue and knowledge are the same
thing: that all real virtue springs from knowledge alone. Saint
Augustine perhaps was hinting at something of this sort when,
addressing himself to God, he bemoaned the crimes of Sodom.
&quot;But how can men's insults touch you, who are undefiled? Or
what injury can be committed against you, who cannot be hurt? But
your vengeance is in that which men do against themselves,
because when they sin against you, they are acting wickedly
against their own souls, and <i>iniquity gives itself the
lie.&quot;</i> Robinson likewise in his New Morality was
attempting to establish an ethic based on love, the Ground of
Being, and he believed that this could be accomplished by de
mythologizing the legalistic Christian ethic. The West of course
insists that the character of mankind is pluralistic and
personal, not monistic and impersonal; in East and West alike,
however, those who affirm the existence of a natural law are in
fundamental agreement on one point: they all base their arguments
on the existence of a primary state of Being. Natural morality is
not possible unless Sartre was wrong and such a primary state of
Being actually exists; it matters not in this case whether you
refer to that state as Atman or as an essential inner nature.
Here, then, we discover a critical point of convergence which
brings together the drug movement, radical theology,
B-psychology, and Eastern metaphysics. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Maslow, for his own part, conceded that all past
attempts to realize a natural morality had failed. But he added
that contemporary developments in psychology &quot;make it
possible for us for the first time to feel confident that this
age-old hope may be fulfilled if only we work hard enough.&quot;
If men knew what they really were like, and what they were meant
to become, the very nature of their Being would emerge as &quot;a
court of ultimate appeal for the determination of good and
bad.&quot; It would at last become possible to establish a system
of &quot;morals-from-within.&quot;In the past, all efforts to
establish such a system have been frustrated by man's apparent
inability to determine what his essential inner nature actually
is. It is all very well to say there is a primary state of
Being&#151;but how does one form any precise knowledge of it? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Maslow thought he now saw a way to solve this
problem. The first step would be for psychology to abandon its
exclusive interest in sickness. Let psychology turn its attention
also to a study of health, and of ends and values as well.
Specifically, let it study the habits and attitudes of healthy,
self-actualizing people: the growth-dominated B-cognizers and
B-lovers who have peak experiences. Maslow said that &quot;it
looks as if <i>there were</i> a single ultimate value for
mankind, a far goal toward which all men strive.&quot; All men to
some degree are struggling to attain that goal, which is the
realization of their essential inner nature; but the
self-actualizers by comparison have the goal already in sight.
Presumably, then, psychology could learn a good deal by keeping
the self-actualizers under close observation&#151;by examining,
for example, the hedonic <i>choices</i> they make in the course
of their daily lives: by taking careful note of the things that
delight them. And why do this? Because, said Maslow, such people
will automatically make the right choices. They will choose
virtue just as we choose a dessert, because virtue delights them.
&quot;They spontaneously tend to do right because that is what
they <i>want</i> to do, what they <i>need</i> to do, what they
enjoy . . .&quot; To such self-disciplined people, said Maslow,
we can safely say: &quot;Do as you will, and it will probably be
all right.&quot; And if this sounds familiar, it may remind us of
that Augustinian directive from which Robinson constructed his
New Morality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through the self-actualizers, therefore, psychology
can discover &quot;which values men trend toward.&quot; Indeed,
said Maslow, &quot;it is possible that we may soon even <i>define</i>
therapy as a search for values.&quot; This in turn calls to mind
a cartoon which appeared in the <i>New Yorker</i>, I believe,
quite a long time ago. A psychiatrist glares down at the
free-associating patient on his couch and snarls, &quot;You
cur!&quot; Or something to that effect. The idea seemed funny at
the time, but in a sense it is just the sort of attitude Maslow
has proposed. Psychology should start making value judgments. It
should say: &quot;Here is what it is like to be fully
human.&quot; &quot;This is wrong.&quot; &quot;That is
right.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Maslow failed to dispose entirely of one problem:
who decides what health is, and who chooses the self-actualizers?
If such an all-wise person exists, then why bother with the
self-actualizers? Why not study him instead? Again we meet one of
those saber-toothed circles, and here again the matter might
rest&#151;if Maslow stood alone in the witness box. As we have
already indicated, however, the case for a primary state of Being
is bolstered by the supporting testimony of psychedelic
experience, mystical experience, radical theology, and the
Eastern movement as such. Coming together as they do, all of
these give added weight to Maslow's argument, just as Maslow's
argument gives added weight to them. Also, each of them provides
as it were an additional laboratory tool with which to probe the
unconscious&#151;and thereby to test the assertions of
B-psychology. It is not necessary to depend upon peak experience
alone, or any one person's definition of a peak experience. The
psychedelics would appear to be especially promising in this
connection, and, in so far as it enables men to know themselves
better, LSD makes a natural morality far more of a possibility
than it has ever been before. There is some evidence that LSD in
effect anesthetizes the Freudian superego&#151;puts to sleep
those internalized parents&#151;and thus allows the intrinsic
conscience to take over. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If you grant the validity of a primary state of
Being, what are the practical implications of this? What would a
natural morality actually mean in terms of human conduct? The
answer is obvious if you assume that the primary state is
monistic in character&#151;you're cut, I bleed&#151;and this
interpretation in fact suggests a possible distinction between
law and justice. If mankind were a single man, and that man had a
gangrenous arm, law would simply whack off the arm to save the
man. Justice would first do all it could to save the arm. Justice
would not be interested in punishing the arm, for the sake of
punishment&#151;and while justice itself might consent finally to
radical surgery, it would do so only as a last resort. Law
recognizes the integrity of the whole. Justice recognizes the
integrity of the whole, but it recognizes also the parts'
participation in that whole. Monism therefore provides a firm
basis for decision-making in interpersonal relationships. It is a
question simply of how much you are willing to hurt yourself. Are
the gains worth the pains&#151;always remembering that the pains
are really yours? (If Stalin had been a monist, for example, he
might have hesitated over his decision to liquidate the kulaks.)
Indeed, this does seem to be the direction in which our court
system is presently moving, to the despair of many good citizens.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a general observation, in fact, whatever our
voiced convictions, it might be said that we act as if life were
monistic. I am struck by this personally whenever I see a fire
engine racing to a fire, or the United Nations in emergency
session&#151;whenever society mobilizes its resources in some
dramatic fashion to protect the welfare of individuals or the
common good. And what, for that matter, is the real meaning of
our personal and social gregariousness? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But after all, it is possible to account for such
phenomena without resorting to an unqualified monism. While it
seeks to preserve the integrity of individual personality,
Western religious tradition has been just as insistent that there
are bonds which in some ineffable way unite us all. We are told
this again now by radical theology, by B-psychology, and
especially perhaps by the drug movement. Whether or not mankind
is utterly monistic, psychedelic experience does seem to hint at
a brotherhood which is something more than brotherhood&#151;and
to this extent it may help to provide a rationale for social
action, including civil rights. As the LSD researcher Willis W.
Harman has said in connection with those who somehow manage to
break the spell of cultural hypnosis, whatever the means, a man
who is privileged to look at ultimate reality will know
thereafter from his own experience &quot;that we are elements of
a greater whole, and that what one does to another he does
ineluctably to himself.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A monistic awareness, qualified or not, might also
explain why LSD has proved helpful in treating alcoholics, who
say they no longer feel isolated from the rest of the world, and
in easing the anguish of terminal patients, who have reported new
insights into the real meaning of life, death, and immortality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In so far as it confirms an unconditional human
nature, LSD might also be helpful in solving another
philosophical problem. Implicit in the idea of a natural ethic
based upon a primary state of Being is a possible validation of
free will&#151;as opposed to a mechanistic determinism. The
modern argument for free will has been founded very often upon
the science of quantum physics and Heisenberg's famous Principle
of Uncertainty or Indeterminacy. Heisenberg said it is impossible
for science to predict the behavior of an individual particle at
the atomic level, since the very act of observation and
measurement will influence the behavior of the particle. (This
has been compared with the difficulty a blind man would encounter
if he attempted to learn about a snowflake by touching one. ) But
some physicists have gone even further; carrying uncertainty to
the point of indeterminacy, they have asserted that individual
particles actually behave in a chaotic, capricious, and lawless
manner. You can never tell what a particular particle is going to
do next, and thus there is no causality or determinism in the
microcosmos. The laws of nature are derived only when you apply
the theory of statistical probability to a vast number of
particles; then individual capriciousness will cancel out, and it
is possible to predict how matter will behave in the macrocosmos.
Flip a coin once and it will come up either heads or tails. Flip
it a million times and it will almost certainly come up heads a
half-million times and tails a half-million times. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some philosophers and theologians have seized upon
this idea, finding in microcosmic anarchy a possible
justification for the thesis that man himself has free will. This
of course links free will inexorably to physics, and it is
perhaps a rather dangerous position. In the first place, there
are those who suggest that the lawlessness of the particles is
only apparent; as Bohm has proposed, an explanation for
microcosmic behavior may yet be discovered at some deeper level
of causation below the atomic and subatomic. And where would that
leave free will, if not on a sawed-off limb? More to the point,
as philosopher Ernst Cassirer has argued, ethics would surely be
in a sorry position if it had to take refuge in the gaps of
scientific knowledge&#151;in a mere possibility which is,
essentially, negative in nature. Should freedom be equated with
causelessness? Is that the kind of ethic you would really prefer
if you had your choice? Could you trust such an ethic, and could
you trust any person whose actions were determined by a
capricious whim? Or would you prefer instead an ethic which is
grounded in reason, and would you rather do business with
somebody whose conduct is determined by his essential inner
nature? Describing Spinoza's views on the subject, Cassirer
wrote: &quot;To act freely does not mean to act arbitrarily or
without prior decision; it means rather to act in accordance with
a decision which is in harmony with the essence of our reason.
This essence and with it the specific priority of reason consists
of the knowledge of the whole.&quot; True ethical judgment, said
Cassirer, does not put a high value on capricious behavior;
rather, &quot;it values a course of action that springs from the
basic substratum of the personality and is firmly anchored in
it.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Natural morality is predicated of course on just
such a substratum&#151;on a primary state of Being&#151;and it
suggests in turn a kind of freedom we might describe as <i>ontological
freedom</i>. This has nothing to do with anarchy or lawlessness.
It implies a freedom to be yourself&#151;or more exactly, a
freedom to become that which you were meant to be. In this sense,
freedom for Beethoven would not mean a freedom to become a sailor
or an architect or an outlaw: it would mean simply a freedom to
become a composer of music. In the same sense, freedom for the
acorn would be a freedom to become an oak tree&#151;not a
hibiscus or a sugar maple, but only an oak. Freedom, in other
words, means the freedom to realize your essential inner nature,
and Beethoven for example would be subject to a blind determinism
only if his father, say, forced him to study medicine.
Ontological freedom applies both to the individual and to the
whole, and it is valid even if the whole should prove to be in
fact monistic. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here too Spinoza has spoken. If we <i>are</i>
nothing more than parts of a whole which is in the process of
realizing itself, we nevertheless contribute to that whole, each
and every one of us. It is an expression of us, just as much as
we are an expression of it. In so far as we partake of the whole,
we each of us determine in part what the whole is and shall be.
If we are cogs in a machine, we are not merely the servants of
the machine: we each of us in part comprise the machine, and it
is just as much subservient to us as we are subservient to it. In
fact, we are the machine, and the machine is us. (What was it
Bergson said? The universe is a machine for the making of God?)
In so far as the whole is free, then we also are free&#151;in so
far as we partake of the whole. The sense of a dictatorial
determinism arises only when we fail to recognize our true
identity or essential inner nature, and it matters not whether
that identity is pluralistic or monistic. The sense of freedom
arises with our <i>awareness</i> of our identity&#151;of our
destiny, if you will&#151;and we recognize that we are free when
we understand that we are responding either to our own inner
nature or to the inner nature of a whole in which we partake.
This perhaps is a deeper meaning of the saying &quot;You shall
know the truth and the truth shall set you free.&quot; The truth
is our essential inner nature, pluralistic or otherwise, and, to
the extent that it provides us with a greater awareness of the
truth, the psychedelic experience sets us free&#151;as do also
the peak and mystical experiences. Or so at least the argument
might run. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In his important book <i>The Secular City</i>,
Harvey Cox has asserted that &quot;the era of metaphysics is
dead&quot; and that &quot;politics replaces metaphysics as the
language of theology.&quot; Perhaps metaphysics is dead for Cox,
who apparently subscribes to the doctrine of God's hiddenness.
But obviously it is very much alive for Altizer, for Bishop
Robinson, for B-psychology, for the drug cults, for the Eastern
movement. In this case Cox may have completely misread the signs
of the times, for it appears far more likely that we are
witnesses today to a significant rebirth of metaphysics. As we
have shown, even psychology is now asking ultimate ontological
questions about the nature of Being. And perhaps it was
inevitable that psychology should do this. As Tillich has
indicated, there are two kinds of anxiety&#151;neurotic and
existential&#151;and only ontology can distinguish the one from
the other. Neurotic anxiety is unreal, or rather has a misplaced
object of attention, while existential anxiety is the result of a
realistic analysis of the way things actually are. Clearly it is
important to distinguish the two, and that is why Tillich
complained about &quot;the lack of an ontological analysis of
anxiety and a sharp distinction between existential and
pathological anxiety.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two decades ago, at the end of the war, Jacques
Maritain wrote: &quot;What is essentially needed is a renewal of
metaphysics. . . . What is needed first and foremost is a
rediscovery of Being, and by the same token a rediscovery of
love. This means, axiomatically, a rediscovery of God. The
existential philosophies which are today in fashion are but a
sign of a certain deep want and desire to find again the sense of
Being.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He said further: &quot;In perceiving Being Reason
knows God.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those words have a prophetic ring now. A
rediscovery of Being is central to the contemporary developments
we have discussed, and from one point of view it might be said
that man today is making another desperate effort to find his God
again. But, as noted, the rediscovered God has seemed more often
than not to be the Eastern God, and the new metaphysics has been
deeply influenced by mysticism. Today's radical ontology may
therefore be subject to a Western-oriented criticism, including a
major objection which was expressed some years ago, in another
connection, by no one less than Tillich: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Mysticism,&quot; said Tillich, &quot;does not
take seriously the concrete and the doubt concerning the
concrete. It plunges directly into the ground of being and
meaning, and leaves the concrete, the world of finite values and
meanings, behind. Therefore it does not solve the problem of
meaninglessness. In terms of the present religious situation this
means that Eastern mysticism is not the solution of the problems
of Western Existentialism, although many people attempt this
solution.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Buber raised the same point in rejecting the
Eastern concept of a mystical union with the godhead: &quot;What
does it help my soul that it can be withdrawn anew from this
world here into unity, when this world itself has of necessity no
part in the unity&#151;what does all 'enjoyment of God' profit a
life that is rent in two? If that abundantly rich heavenly moment
has nothing to do with my poor earthly moment&#151;what has it
then to do with me, who have still to live, in all seriousness
still to live, on earth?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This brings us back to questions we asked earlier.
Are the East and the West as diametrically opposed as they appear
to be? Or are they both perhaps attempting to say the same thing,
in different ways? </p>

<h2>12. The Jordan and the Ganges</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nature does not count, said Bergson. Neither does
it measure. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The French philosopher, who died in 1941, has been
harshly judged for his anti-intellectualism and for the essential
role he assigned to intuition in man's perception of ultimate
reality. But his views on the limitations of the intellect have
acquired a new significance today in light of the contemporary
developments we have discussed in this book, and they may help
illuminate an important aspect of drug cultism and related
movements. In Bergson, indeed, those movements may yet discover
their metaphysician. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In criticizing intellect, and therefore science as
well, Bergson asserted that intellect has its eyes turned always
to the rear. By this he meant that the rational mind is concerned
primarily with prediction based on past experience, or in other
words with the anticipation that cause-and-effect events will
repeat themselves in the future. And intellect favors this kind
of perception because intellect is interested only in action, or
in using things by acting upon them (I-It). Lecomte du Nouy made
the same point, no doubt taking it from Bergson, when he
commented, &quot;The aim of science is to foresee, and not, as
has often been said, to understand.&quot; Of course it <i>does</i>
foresee. It is highly successful as far as its own limited goals
are concerned, and the world's work could not be done without it.
But it does not understand, and philosophers delude themselves,
said Bergson, &quot;when they import into the domain of
speculation a method of thinking made for action.&quot;
Cause-and-effect prediction is valid enough in one sense, but the
intellect in another sense has actually created cause and effect.
It has done so by artificially dividing and, as it were, freezing
in time a reality which in fact consists of a dynamic and
indivisible Whole. The intellect cannot comprehend movement, and
it cannot comprehend the Whole. In short, it cannot comprehend
life. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dividing? Freezing? What did Bergson mean? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the first instance, to borrow an example which
Bergson used himself, suppose for a moment that reality consisted
of a curved line. Science imagines it can grasp the ultimate
truth about life by chopping the Whole into pieces&#151;by
reducing reality to ever smaller units of matter and energy.
Science therefore would divide the curved line into individual
points or segments, and it would then try to explain the Whole in
terms of its parts. But each of the individual segments would, in
itself, be almost a straight line&#151;and the smaller the
segment, the greater the illusion of straightness. Thus, by
restricting its vision, science quite likely would propose that
reality consists of a straight line, or rather a series of
straight lines. Following the same sort of logic, we can imagine
science announcing the discovery that Wordsworth's ode is
composed of twenty-six basic particles (the letters of the
alphabet), and while this observation is perfectly correct, it
hardly captures the meaning and significance of the poem as a
Whole. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for movement, Bergson likened the intellect to a
motion picture camera. The intellect simulates movement by taking
a series of snapshots, each one of which is frozen in time for
purpose of analysis. Intellect studies these snapshots and thinks
that in doing so it is studying true motion. But clearly it is
not. This Bergson referred to as the <i>cinematographical fallacy</i>,
which has its basis in &quot;the absurd proposition that movement
is made of immobilities.&quot; And thus Bergson explained the
paradoxes of the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno, including the
paradox of the arrow fired from a point A to a point B. According
to Zeno, the flying arrow must successively occupy a series of
lesser points between A and B. and it must obviously be at rest
at each such point, at least for a moment; therefore it is
motionless during the entire course of its passage. Or again, the
arrow in its flight must first cover half the distance from A to
B. But before it can do that, it must first cover half the
distance from A to the midpoint. And half of that distance. And
half of <i>that</i> distance. And so on, until at last we see
that it is impossible for the arrow to get started at all. But we
know that the arrow does travel from A to B. so there must be
something wrong with Zeno's argument, and Bergson resolved the
problem by suggesting that the flight is in fact &quot;an
indivisible movement.&quot; Once the flight is over, you can
count as many imaginary points as you like along its trajectory.
The fact remains that the flight itself was accomplished &quot;in
one stroke,&quot; from A to B. although a certain amount of time
was required for this flight. Thus Bergson accused the intellect
of neglecting time, or duration, as an actual factor in the
mosaic of reality. Science deals with points of time, he said,
but it does not deal with time itself or with motion as such. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand, said Bergson, instinct directly
installs itself within movement and reality. It refuses to
recognize those points of time and those snapshots of life which
are nothing more than &quot;arrests of our attention.&quot;
Instinct thereby provides us with a form of knowledge which is
&quot;practically useless, except to increase pure understanding
of reality.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bergson did not advocate that we rely solely on
instinct. Nor did he deny the necessary function of the
intellect. But he did reject an utter reliance on intellect alone
or instinct alone. The one is necessary for survival, the other
for understanding. &quot;There are things that intelligence alone
is able to seek, but which, by itself, it will never find. These
things instinct alone could find; but it will never seek
them.&quot; But <i>intuition</i> can both seek and find them.
Intuition for Bergson was a combination of instinct and
intelligence&#151;it was instinct guided by intelligence&#151;and
the same happy marriage has been proposed by many others,
including Gibran. Thus instinct is the wind which fills the sails
of our little ship, as it skims over the waves of this earthly
existence. And intellect is the rudder with which we steer the
ship. Similarly, life is complicated only when we consider its
parts rather than the Whole, and its apparent complexity
increases in proportion with the number of parts which we
synthetically ascribe to that Whole. And this perhaps is the
basis of the Hindu teaching: &quot;He who knows OM knows
all.&quot; (He who knows the monistic One knows all.) If the
consciousness that slumbers in instinct should awake, said
Bergson, &quot;it would give up to us the most intimate secrets
of life.&quot; It would do so by revealing to us the Whole,
philosophy being nothing less than man's attempt to dissolve once
more into that Whole from which he has estranged
himself&#151;that Whole where there are no measurements and no
laws (only science has laws, not nature), where &quot;there is
nothing left but the reality that flows, together with the
knowledge ever renewed that it impresses on us of its present
state.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That, in brief, was Bergson's case against a
slavish reliance on the rational intellect, and it would seem
that his point of view today is reflected to a considerable
extent in the assertions of radical theology, psychology, and
pharmacology. Maslow, for example, has expressed his criticism of
&quot;the need-motivated kind of perception, which <i>shapes</i>
things . . . in the manner of a butcher chopping apart a
carcass.&quot; We must give up, he said, &quot;our 3,000-year-old
habit of dichotomizing, splitting and separating in the style of
Aristotelian logic.... Difficult though it may be, we must learn
to think holistically rather than atomistically.&quot; In the
same sense, in the context of Zen, Suzuki stated that the central
fact of life &quot;cannot be brought to the dissecting table of
the intellect,&quot; and he said further: &quot;To stop the flow
of life and to look into it is not the business of Zen.&quot;
Taking a metaphor from chess, Dr. Sidney Cohen described LSD
perception as a kind of knight's-move thinking which leaps over
logical premises and formal syllogisms. Huxley called for a
recognition of the non-verbal humanities, or &quot;the arts of
being directly aware of the given facts of our existence.&quot;
There is New Theology's emphasis upon &quot;presentness&quot; and
here-now, derived especially from Bonhoeffer, Bultmann, and
Buber. We could give many more examples, but perhaps we have made
our point&#151;that the psychic pendulum may be swinging again
from the rational and the conscious to the intuitive and the
unconscious, for better or for worse, resulting in a phenomenon
which Maslow has termed &quot;the current call back to raw
experience as prior to any concepts or abstractions.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our acceptance of the intellect's perceptions has
always been tempered, to some degree at least, with doubt and
uncertainty. Consider a nightmare. What does it represent, if not
a temporary suspension of the natural order we normally perceive?
And what does it express, if not a concealed fear that cause and
effect are not wholly to be trusted or depended upon&#151;that
they may break down at any moment in waking life, leaving us
naked and defenseless? We sense perhaps that the ordered universe
with its immutable laws is not real at all but our own invention,
and there is no guarantee that those laws tomorrow may not be
rescinded. In the nightmare they are rescinded, revealing to us
our subliminal anxiety. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But anxiety can turn to joy&#151;and does so in the
mystical, peak, and psychedelic experiences. We are suggesting,
then, that there is a common factor in all of these
meta-experiences. The common factor is an apparent suspension of
cause and effect&#151;and this in turn is the result of a
temporary paralysis of the intellect, as Bergson defined the
intellect. Simply that and nothing more&#151;or that and nothing
less. We are suggesting also, as indicated earlier, that the
intellect is the basis for the myth of the Demiurge, that
imperfect deity who is the cause of the fall from pure Being, the
creation of matter, our phenomenal existence, and the Net of
Illusion. And such an interpretation might well enable us to
accommodate within the radical Western framework many fundamental
doctrines of Eastern metaphysics. After all, it is possible to
demythologize the East as well as the West, and such an effort
now could lead at last to that reconciliation which has long been
predicted. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the East, as also in Plato's philosophy, the Net
of Illusion has commonly been blamed on the body, or more
specifically the senses, with the assertion that the world
perceived by the senses is not real. The Eastern viewpoint has
therefore appeared to be world-denying, and as such it has found
small favor in the West, where men for the most part have obeyed
an impulse to affirm the world, sorry as it may seem. But there
is an alternative theory, and the contemporary meta-experience
might seem to confirm it. It is not the body which is at fault,
but only a <i>part</i> of the body: namely, the noetic brain, or
that prefrontal bulge, pronounced in man, which accounts for the
rational process and the rational way of viewing the world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus the world itself is real enough; it is only
our way of looking at the world which is not real. It is our mode
of perception that leads us astray, and it is not the senses
which deceive us but rather the mind or intellect which receives
and interprets the sensory input. That evolutionary gift, the
cerebral cortex, has enabled us so far to survive and to prosper,
but it also has distorted our vision of ultimate reality. It
directs our vision in such a way that we can see the world now
only in a symbolic fashion, in terms of use and action. We know
what happens, for example, when a man puts on a pair of those
inverting spectacles which cause all images to appear upside
down; after a time the man will adjust to the situation, and the
images will appear to him right side up again. In the same way,
perhaps, there is something which determines that we shall always
see things in a certain manner: a kind of internal processing
center for the raw data from the senses. No doubt this is for our
own good, just as the rigid rules and the white lies of the
parent are no doubt intended for the welfare of the child. But it
is nevertheless restrictive, and it is based in a sense on a form
of deceit. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It might be argued, then, that Eastern wisdom
conceals an esoteric teaching along the lines of this same
proposition. The East, it may be, has also meant <i>&quot;as
if.&quot;</i> The Net of Illusion does not refer to the world at
all; it refers to our perception of the world. By the same token,
OM is not an immaterial abstraction which transcends the world of
matter and earthly existence; it is the world we live in but do
not see: it is here-now, I-Thou, and &quot;the reality that
flows.&quot; Nirvana therefore does not imply a release from the
body which leaves the world behind; it implies a mental or
spiritual awakening which allows us to look at the world as it
actually is. It does not deny the world. It affirms the world but
rejects all partial views of it. It rejects the intellect, and it
rejects the supposed order which intellect imagines it perceives
in cause-and-effect relationships. As Spinoza suggested, this
order perhaps is self-realizing. It is what we look for, what we
are used to, and what we expect. If the world tomorrow should
fall into disorder, we should soon perceive this too as perfect
order. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Mahayana Buddhism, the East itself has appeared
to move toward a similar interpretation&#151;from a denial of the
world to a more perfect affirmation of the world&#151;and this
movement, as we have seen, comes to full expression in the
teachings of Japanese Zen Buddhism. The goal of Zen is <i>satori</i>.
And <i>satori</i> is not a denial of the world, nor is it a form
of release from the world. It is, said Suzuki, <i>the acquiring
of a new viewpoint</i>. It is a new way of looking at things, and
it is designed specifically to overcome the intellect's way of
looking at things. It is designed to destroy the intellect. As
Suzuki put it: <i>&quot;Satori</i> may be defined as intuitive
looking-into, in contradiction to intellectual and logical
understanding.&quot; It is not interested in concepts,
abstractions, and a limited perception; &quot;it does not care so
much for the elaboration of particulars as for a comprehensive
grasp of the whole, and this intuitively.&quot; It is interested
in the here and now, and it accepts the world. &quot;What was up
in the heavens, Zen has brought down to earth.&quot; It too
proclaims the reality that flows. Thus the Zen master denies that
reality is this, that, or the other thing; and when he is asked
what is left, he slaps his pupil and declares, &quot;You fool,
what is this?&quot; <i>Satori</i>, then, is a new kind of
perception; but it is nevertheless a perception of this world.
&quot;It is not that something different is seen, but that one
sees differently.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All this would seem to indicate that the radical
West and the demythologized East are not so far apart concerning
the Net of Illusion, and the worldly Westerner need not hesitate
for this reason to join that so-called leap to the East. From
Dietrich Bonhoeffer to James Bond, the contemporary emphasis upon
this world and this time is wholly compatible with the esoteric
interpretation of Eastern thought. In so far as they confirm the
reality of this world, the new insights into the nature of
meta-experiences challenge the orthodox Hindu as much as they do
the orthodox Baptist, and we may be experiencing today not so
much a leap to the East as the emergence at last of a possible
East-West synthesis: a historic blending, as it were, of the
waters of the Jordan and the Ganges. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If the East and West should agree that the world is
real, however, where would this leave the question of
immortality? And what of reincarnation? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reincarnation has been represented as a cycle of
death and rebirth, while nirvana has been represented as a
release from this cycle&#151;and a release thereby from the
world. After a final death, according to the popular Western
view, one merges with the Absolute and thus achieves immortality
in a state of pure Being somewhere beyond the pitiful world of
appearances and phenomena. We have said, however, that the world
beyond the world of appearances is <i>this</i> world seen in a
different way. We have said that nirvana is realized in this
world by living men, not in some other world by dead men. <i>Nirvana
is the pure experience of the present moment in this world here
and now</i>. That at least was the esoteric interpretation, and
we might very well ask, then, what this interpretation has to say
on the question of death and immortality. Does it not in fact
neglect the question altogether, leaving unanswered the fate of
man when life is ended and death occurs? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The esoteric reply might be that life never ends
and that death is just one more delusion of the intellect.
Immortal life is not experienced in some ethereal realm beyond
this world; it is experienced in this world, here, and that was
the deeper meaning of the statement that nirvana is realized in
this world by living men. To see the world as it really is means
to understand that life is immortal. And thus the myth of the
terrible wheel of death and rebirth. The wheel is caused by the
intellect, and it is nothing more than the rational way of
looking at things. The wheel is the I-It mind. It does not mean
that we are cursed to return again and again to this world, for
there is no other place we could possibly go. <i>There is only
this world. There is nothing else</i>. The myth means that we are
compelled by the intellect to go on and on imagining there is
something else, and also to go on and on imagining the world
exists as the intellect portrays it. To escape from the wheel
means simply to become aware that the world it portrays is not
the real world at all, or not the whole world. To escape from the
wheel means to understand that death is false and that life is
immortal. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you
free, from death as well as mechanism. If the intellect by nature
cannot understand life, it follows that the intellect by nature
cannot understand death. Its view of death results from the fact
that it looks only at the parts, not at the Whole. If it would
once look at the Whole, it would see immediately that life is
immortal. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This interpretation would seem to justify
immortality on a strictly monistic basis, by sacrificing
pluralism; it preserves the One only by denying the reality of
the individual selves. And what of the Western emphasis on
personal survival of the individual self or soul? The esoteric
doctrine would be that it is precisely our insistence on personal
immortality which makes us blind to our actual immortality. The
individual ego or personality has no real significance, and
therefore the death of this personality has no real significance
and should not be regretted. It is only because we insist on the
significance of the one that the fact of the other seems so
terribly important to us. And anyway, what do we really mean by
personal? The truth is, the Western emphasis on this element has
lately become at least somewhat less emphatic. In rejecting what
he called the religious interpretation of Christianity,
Bonhoeffer wrote from his prison in Berlin: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In my view, that means to speak on the one hand
    metaphysically and on the other hand individualistically.
    Neither of these is relevant to the Bible message or to the
    man of today. Is it not true to say that individualistic
    concern for personal salvation has almost completely left us
    all? Are we not really under the impression that there are
    more important things than bothering about such a matter?
    (Perhaps not more important than the matter itself, but more
    than bothering about it.) I know it sounds pretty monstrous
    to say that. But is it not, at bottom, even biblical? Is
    there any concern in the Old Testament about saving one's
    soul at all? Is not righteousness and the Kingdom of God on
    earth the focus of everything, and is not Romans 3.14 ff.,
    too, the culmination of the view that in God alone is
    righteousness, and not in an individualistic doctrine of
    salvation? It is not with the next world that we are
    concerned, but with this world . . . </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tillich wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Even if the so-called arguments for the &quot;immortality
    of the soul&quot; had argumentative power (which they do not
    have) they would not convince existentially. For
    existentially everybody is aware of the complete loss of self
    which biological extinction implies. The unsophisticated mind
    knows instinctively what sophisticated ontology formulates:
    that reality has the basic structure of self-world
    correlation and that with the disappearance of the one side,
    the world, the other side, the self, also disappears, and
    what remains is their common ground but not their structural
    correlation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Again, what do we mean by personal&#151;and by
personal survival? The meta-experience suggests that we are all
expressions or aspects of a primary state of Being. And this is
immortal. Therefore, we too are immortal&#151;for we are it. In
each of us the primary state comes briefly to a sharp focus: we
suddenly appear, like the dew that condenses from the still
morning air, or a wave that lifts from the surface of the sea.
The dew burns away, the wave drops, and we die. But there is no
real death. There is something elemental which survives and
re-expresses itself. Thus a great actor might look back on the
roles he has created and might also forget some of his lesser
performances; but he does not imagine that he himself died with
the closing of a play: he goes on, growing in talent, and even
his failures may serve to instruct him. Similarly, what dies when
a man dies is simply a role. What dies is merely a point of focus
where Being had concentrated itself. What dies, in the last
analysis, are only the particular memories which Being had
accumulated at this point or that point, in this role or the
other. And even the better of these are preserved by speech and
by pen. What dies are only particular points of view. And the
better of these are also preserved, for so long as they seem
valid: until still better replace them. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All this is what the meta-experience seems to tell
us, and no doubt it does not look very convincing or comforting
on the printed page. Perhaps it appears to say only that life
goes on&#151;meaning that life goes on but you do not. But
descriptions of the meta-experience are not the same as the
experience, and the experience would seem to mean something more
than life goes on: it would seem to mean that you go on
too&#151;although not in the traditional sense of reappearing
somewhere after death with all of your thoughts, memories, and
personal cachets intact. However desirable this latter kind of
survival might normally appear to us, the fact remains that the
meta-experiencer finds it neither desirable nor in any sense
important. In a state of unsanity, it just doesn't matter. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Possibly the West could assimilate this
interpretation of immortality, if it had to, since nobody really
believes in personal survival anyway. We might be able to accept
a monistic structure after death. What is far more difficult to
accept is the thought that life has this character here upon the
earth. The idea that other people do not really exist as separate
entities can be a terrifying idea&#151;pure hell, in
fact&#151;for it leaves you more alone even than Sartre would
leave you. Not we are alone, with no excuses, but I am alone.
There is an appalling difference between those two statements,
and it is really the fundamental difference between the Western
view and the Eastern. If life after death can be purchased only
by paying the price of earthly pluralism, there are many perhaps
who would not care to pay that price&#151;who would give up the
former, if they could, to retain the latter. And obviously you
cannot have both a monistic immortality and a pluralistic
mortality, since monistic survival is predicated on the
assumption that life itself is monistic. There may therefore be a
deep and basic wisdom reflected in the West's instinctive
rejection of this horror. On the other hand, however, it could be
a matter not of wisdom but of courage, or the lack of it: to say
that the idea is terrifying is not to say that it is not true. In
any case, it is a question to be faced&#151;posed again now by
the meta-experience. And it is hard. Very hard. This is why we
said earlier that the Eastern challenge to pluralism is more
critical even than the challenge to transcendence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meta-experience does not really deny the
possibility of some unseen dimension which transcends the
experience; it simply fails to provide us with any evidence to
support the possibility&#151;and, further, it does not suggest
any need for this hypothesis. If there is a transcendent power,
well and good. If not, that is all right too. The reality
suggested by the experience is reality enough, if that is all
there is, and the experience therefore has nothing to do with the
existence or non-existence of a separate God. The experience
tells us only that our normal perception of the world is limited
and limiting: that we are deceived in our perception by a mental
process, the seat of which can be anatomically localized in the
human brain&#151;which can even in fact be excised by surgery.
The experience tells us to stop living only in the past and the
future, or in a present moment which is perceived always in terms
of the past and the future. It tells us that we need no longer be
estranged from reality and from ourselves. The Eden story can now
come to its inevitable and happy conclusion; the flaming sword
has been extinguished, and we are free at last to re-enter the
garden. It tells us this, and it does not tell us there is no
transcendent God. After all, how could it? Negatives are hard to
prove in any instance, and I cannot, for example, conclusively
demonstrate that there is not at this moment a pink owl perched
in a lime tree on the fifth moon of Jupiter. Nor do I especially
care whether there is or isn't. But only a fool would insist that
his vision necessarily takes in the whole of reality, and one
wonders if God himself could ever be sure there was not somewhere
some other God who transcends him. Thus the meta-experience tells
us only what it sees; it speaks to us of this world&#151;and it
may be that this esoteric interpretation at least partially
answers the objection of Tillich and Buber that mysticism is
world-denying and therefore an inadequate response to existential
anxiety. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The meta-experience, then, is not directly
concerned with the question of God; but it is not for this reason
any the less fundamental in its assertions. As William James put
it to us, quoting Leuba: &quot;Does God really exist? How does he
exist? What is he? are so many irrelevant questions. Not God, but
life, more life, a larger, richer, more satisfying life, is, in
the last analysis, the end of religion. The love of life, at any
and every level of development, is the religious impulse.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the
meta-experience offers an accurate perception of ultimate
reality. We still must ask whether it is wise or prudent to seek
that experience and achieve that perception. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For one thing, the experience suggests that symbols
serve only to distort our view of the actual world. But I can
never forget Helen Keller's story of that day at the well house,
at the age of seven, when she first learned the meaning of
language. Before that, she said, she had been only a wild little
animal lost in the dark, unable to give love or receive it.
&quot;Before that supreme event there was nothing in me except
the instinct to eat and drink and sleep. My days were a blank,
without past, present, or future, without hope or anticipation,
without interest or joy.&quot; Then Anne Sullivan held one of her
hands under the running pump, and into the other she spelled out
&quot;w-a-t-e-r.&quot; The meta-experiencer would say of course
that &quot;w-a-t-e-r&quot; and water are two different things;
but Miss Keller has given us her own reaction. &quot;I knew then
that 'w-a-t-e-r' meant the wonderful cool something that was
flowing over my hand. That living word awakened my soul, gave it
light, hope, joy, set it free!&quot; Or again: &quot;All at once
there was a strange stir within me &#151;a misty consciousness, a
sense of something remembered.... Nothingness was blotted out....
That word 'water' dropped into my mind like the sun in a frozen
winter world.&quot; And we might do well to remember this before
we decide to blow out that sun. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An obvious objection to the meta-experience is that
it denies or ignores the existence of evil&#151;which it
considers simply a dualistic deception. And this was the main
objection James had to the optimistic mysticism of Whitman. You
cannot ignore evil, said James, for &quot;the skull will grin in
at the banquet.&quot; &quot;Here on our very hearths and in our
gardens,&quot; he said, &quot;the infernal cat plays with the
panting mouse, or holds the hot bird fluttering in her jaws.
Crocodiles and rattlesnakes and pythons are at this moment
vessels of life as real as we are; their loathsome existence
fills every minute of every day that drags its length
along.&quot; For his part, James preferred an optimism which
first acknowledged evil and yet saw hope. Only this could we
really trust. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There are the clear and present dangers which
threaten the individual who is in the grips of a meta-experience:
running in front of cars, leaping from windows with the
expectation of flying, a generalized indifference to injury and
death. But there is also a less clear and even more present
danger which threatens the vitality and welfare of society
itself, and this is the danger of a quietistic indifference to
social goals and social rewards. Until very recently there was
little cause for concern about this, and Maslow provides us with
an excellent example. While he conceded there was a possible
quietistic danger inherent in the peak experience, he added that
the experience came rarely even to self-actualizing people, and
as late as 1962 he wrote: &quot;Therefore the problem posed here
is more an ultimate than an immediate one, more a theoretical
problem than a practical one.&quot; Now LSD has made the problem
both immediate and practical, and the issue must be dealt with. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Prohibitive laws are one answer, and certainly
there is little to be said for the so-called Gumball Machine
theory that psychedelics should be freely dispensed to the
general population, with no restrictions. We do after all have
gun laws (though not very good ones); we have laws regarding the
purchase and consumption of liquor; and there are regulations and
licensing procedures for people who want to drive autos or fly
airplanes. In view of the potential dangers of an immediate
nature, it might seem fair to put psychedelics in the same
category as alcohol, guns, planes, and cars. But in fact the
governmental response has been to outlaw them almost altogether.
This apparently has succeeded only in frustrating some very
important research by scientists, and it is doubtful in any case
whether legal measures can resolve the more basic questions that
are raised by the drug movement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is the other side of the Delphic coin. <i>Know
Thyself</i>, yes. But also <i>Nothing in Excess</i>. As Suzuki
put it: &quot;There is also such a thing as too much attachment
to the experience of <i>satori</i>, which is to be
detested.&quot; This appears to be a very neat answer, but it is
much too easy telling people to behave themselves, and urging
moderation in this thing of all things is no solution. LSD may
not be addictive, but truth is. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This brings us to the test James suggested for the
revelations of drunkenness. &quot;If merely 'feeling good' could
decide,&quot; said James, &quot;drunkenness would be the
supremely valid human experience.&quot; The question is&#151;does
the experience work out when it is inserted into the environment?
This is another way of asking whether the individual continues to
function and survive, and whether or not the world's work still
gets done. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the psychedelic quietist would reply that none
of these things matters. It is the environment that is out of
joint, and the world's work is ridiculous. As for survival, life
is eternal&#151; especially so for a psychic mutant. And just by
the way, there is nothing evil about pythons and rattlesnakes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is not to say that all drug cultists are
quietists. In fact, there is a fundamental dichotomy within the
drug movement, and this is reflected in the programs and
philosophies of the two major psychedelic churches&#151;the
Church of the Awakening and the Neo-American Church&#151;that
existed before Timothy Leary's League for Spiritual Discovery was
founded in 1966. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Church of the Awakening, mentioned earlier,
might be described as the middle-class right wing of the
movement. Many of its members are businessmen or professional
people, and the church insists that even psychedelic religion has
both an internal and an external function&#151;the latter to be
expressed in terms of &quot;love,&quot; &quot;service,&quot; and
&quot;growth.&quot; In its statement of purpose, the church adds:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is important to recognize and to understand the
    existence of these two functions, internal and external; to
    recognize that we have a basic need and urge to <i>learn</i>,
    and an equally basic one to <i>serve</i>, to share. Next, of
    course, there must be an aspiration of the achievement of
    these objectives within the heart of each of us. And then,
    this knowledge and aspiration must be channeled into action.
    We must <i>do</i> something about it! </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Neo-American Church, on the other hand,
represents more or less the bohemian left wing of the drug
movement. It would seem to be dedicated only to &quot;the
appreciation of Transcendental Reality,&quot; and, although the
church officially advocates a kind of revolutionary nihilism, the
membership in general appears to be more interested in withdrawal
than revolt. The inclination is to &quot;turn on and drop
out.&quot; There are individual exceptions, of course, but this
is the overall impression one gets. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Neo-American Church to date has received far
more publicity than the Church of the Awakening has, and it has
been more aggressive in recruiting new members&#151;particularly
among the young. While a cleavage does exist, then, it would seem
nevertheless that there are now many more quietists than
activists within the drug movement as a whole, and the problem
grows more pressing with every day that passes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychedelic quietist of course does not
consider his attitude a problem&#151;he considers-it a
solution&#151;and in fact he might argue that there is precedent
for his decision to withdraw from the mainstream, renouncing the
goals and rewards of society. Would not identical consequences
follow if Christians started to take the New Testament literally?
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The quietist asserts that there is no destination
ahead of us; we are already there. He announces, in effect, that
he is getting off the bus. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It may be, then, that the question comes down to
this: Is the cosmic bus going anywhere? </p>

<h2>13. OM or Omega?</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There may often be good reasons for bad laws. The
sexual act, for example, is condoned only if the partners
involved are a male and a female who are married (to each other),
and any deviation from that pattern is proscribed as sinful and
evil. It is difficult to believe, however, that there is anything
intrinsically wicked in the performance of a mechanical act
engaged in by consenting partners. Young people especially are
more and more inclined to ask, &quot;Why not?&quot; And the
reasons offered are not very convincing. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the reasons offered may not be the real
reasons. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Human society is founded pragmatically on the
family unit, and it has therefore been necessary to encourage
matrimony and to challenge at once any conduct or philosophy
which appears to threaten the stability of that institution. Thus
the marriage relationship is represented as the only legitimate
source of sexual gratification, and thus also the myth is
promulgated that sex outside the marriage bed is a personal sin
against your body and soul&#151;a violation of heavenly law. But
the law is man-made, not celestial, and the sin in fact may be
real enough&#151;but it is social, not personal. It is a sin
against the social structure and therefore a sin against the
common good. Such an idea of course is hard to convey, and
society (or life) has relied instead upon a necessary fiction.
There are many today who recognize the fiction and who seek to
destroy it; but they fail to recognize the reason for the
fiction, or the purpose it has served, or the problems involved
in replacing it. Their efforts therefore are met with a blind and
instinctive resistance, which they assess as mere prudishness.
But it is more than prudishness; it is life trying to protect
itself, as best it can, in the only way it knows how. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the same sense, perhaps, there would appear to
be an instinctive reaction against the drug movement's monistic
pronouncements&#151;as also its quietistic emphasis upon the pure
experience of the here-now present moment. Assuming that life (or
society) has some dumb understanding of its own welfare, or its
own destiny, we might inquire into the source of this reaction. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for monism, an analogy could be made to the
human body and the cells which compose it. The body is a monistic
whole in which the cells all partake, although the cells can have
no notion of that fact: each is assigned its specialized
function, thus enabling the body to go about its business. What
would happen, then, if these dutiful cells or selves should
somehow gain awareness of the greater Self in which they
participate? What would happen if they ceased their functioning
to con template the body? Most likely, the body would not like
that very much and would order the cells to stop it at once. For
the greater Self has its greater business to attend to. If the
hand indeed is divided into five fingers, the better to do its
work, this clearly implies, does it not, that there is work to be
done? And it cannot be done if the fingers are curled inward in a
self-admiring fist. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A similar interpretation is possible in the case of
&quot;presentness.&quot; As we have seen, a here-now rejection of
the intellect's perception is a rejection in essence of the past
and the future&#151;especially the future&#151;and this brings us
again to another East-West dichotomy which seems at least to be
basic in nature. It is said that the orthodox East looks backward
to a primordial totality (and in this sense perhaps it
acknowledges the past, but not in the sense of using the past to
predict future action). The demythologized East does not look
backward; but neither does it look forward: it is concerned alone
with the here-now present moment. This is another way of saying
that it accepts the status quo. The West on the other hand looks
both backward and forward&#151;but especially forward. It looks
to the future. And it does so with the implication that there is
unfinished business to be conducted there; otherwise its constant
peering into the future is a matter simply of perceptual
deception, as charged. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Thus the myth of the Demiurge comes into
conflict with the myth of Ulysses.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Ulysses myth is a Western myth. It does not
accept the status quo of the present moment but suggests instead
that life is evolving. This process in turn points toward a
future purpose, and acceptance of the present moment would defeat
that purpose. Darwin of course showed that life is constantly
transforming itself&#151;changing its forms, in the manner of
Proteus&#151;but he failed to show that it is truly evolving in
the sense of having a definite direction, purpose, and goal.
Others in the West, however, have said that life is evolving in
precisely this sense. Hegel has said it, Nietzsche has said it,
Bergson has said it, Altizer has said it, Maslow has said
it&#151;and Teilhard de Chardin has said it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hegel depicted the universe as an absolute Mind
which is seeking to fulfill itself and know itself. Nietzsche
proclaimed the Overman and the will to power; man is but a
bridge, he said, and life is that which must ever surpass itself.
Bergson spoke of a vital force which advances, creatively, toward
a distant future end which cannot be predicted because it is not
predetermined. Altizer asserted that God himself is evolving,
from transcendence to immanence, and he specifically rejected
&quot;the backward movement of Oriental mysticism.&quot; He
rejected the orthodox Eastern view of a &quot;lost paradise&quot;
we can only regain through &quot;a reversal of the cosmos.&quot;
&quot;Above all,&quot; said Altizer, &quot;a reborn and radical
Christian faith must renounce every temptation to return to an
original or primordial sacred, or to follow a backward path
leading to an earlier and presumably purer form of the
Word.&quot; In the same context, Maslow has distinguished between
Being and Becoming; between a &quot;high Nirvana&quot; and
&quot;low Nirvana&quot;; between the &quot;the Heaven ahead&quot;
(of growth) and &quot;the Heaven behind&quot; (of regression).
Nowhere in recent times, however, has the concept of a
goal-directed cosmos been given richer expression than is found
in the metaphysical system of the scientist-priest Teilhard, who
developed a profoundly unorthodox theory of universal evolution. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Teilhard, a Jesuit, had been forbidden to publish
that theory during his lifetime; but his views have attracted
widespread attention since his death in 1955, and respect for his
system has continued to grow both inside and outside the Roman
Catholic Church. For many of the faithful, with the passage of
time, Teilhard's ideas have appeared to be more and more profound
and less and less unorthodox&#151;which is hardly surprising, for
they represent in fact an attempted reconciliation of scientific
knowledge and religious tradition. It is difficult to say whether
Teilhard was a mystical scientist or a scientific mystic, but he
is worth listening to in either case. He speaks to the
contemporary situation. And what is more, he addresses himself
directly to the issues raised by psychedelic quietism. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Teilhard proposed, to start, that evolution is not
just willy-nilly Darwinian transformism. It has a definite
direction. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the beginning, in the primordial chaos, the
individual particles of unorganized matter contained certain
elementary &quot;liberties,&quot; but matter by and large was
subject to the laws of chance and statistical determinism. After
a time, however, the particles began to organize&#151;first in
simple forms, then in complex forms. As eons passed, the forms
became increasingly complex. And this complexity resulted at last
in a new phenomenon: it resulted in consciousness. For
consciousness is a product of complexity. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At first there was a primitive animal
consciousness. Then, further complexification produced the human
brain&#151;and rational consciousness. For the first time,
evolution became aware of itself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This, then, is evolution's direction: toward
increasing complexity and (as a result) increasing consciousness.
Thus, by tracing the pattern of <i>psychical</i> rather than <i>physical</i>
development, Teilhard laid the basis for a neo-anthropocentricity
which restores man to the center of things as the most complex
and conscious creation. Man is not just a speck lost in a remote
corner of infinite space. If the universe is a super-organism
which is in the process now of realizing itself, then man is the
&quot;head&quot; of that organism. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But evolution did not stop with the emergence of
the human brain. From that point on, complexification continued
in the form of <i>social</i> <i>organization</i> and human
technology. Teilhard saw no reason to distinguish these from
&quot;natural&quot; (biological) evolution; for there is nothing
unnatural in nature, and the wireless is simply an extension of
the evolving human mind. The computer and the space probe are
similar extensions, Teilhard would have insisted, had he lived to
see their era, for what do they represent if not an enlargement
of our total awareness? By the same logic, government at all
levels is an expansion of overall consciousness, through
complexification, which allows us to deal with an ever wider area
of concern, and the United Nations may be the harbinger of a
global mind with global awareness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As we saw in an earlier chapter, Teilhard held that
this process is directed from within by an indwelling Christ who
took charge of evolution by partially inserting himself into
matter. Teilhard stated further that the process will lead
eventually to a final state of super-organization and
super-awareness he referred to as the Omega point. At this stage,
in a hyper-centration of cosmic matter, mankind will reflect upon
itself at a single point&#151;and will leave the earth behind to
become pure spirit. Mankind will abandon this world to rejoin the
godhead&#151;not by space ship, but spiritually and inwardly. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ideally, this should happen. But, said Teilhard,
there is no predestined guarantee that this will happen. The
Omega point must be attained by conscious effort. And already
there are ominous portents. Even now, &quot;a whirlpool is
beginning to appear ahead of us, in the stream that carries us
along.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a magnificent construction, Teilhard divided the
human race into two camps, the pessimists and the optimists, and
the latter camp he divided into buddhists, pluralists, and
monists. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Man must choose his evolutionary path, said
Teilhard. And each of these divisions represents a potential
choice or possible path. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. The first choice is pessimism or optimism. The
question in this case is fundamental, and it is simply Hamlet's
question asked on a grand scale. To Be or not to Be? That is the
question the whole universe must ask itself. Does it make any
sense to exist, or would it be better perhaps if there was no
life at all? In the early stages of evolution, the universe
instinctively chooses life over non-life and Being over
non-Being; it instinctively chooses to Be. But what happens when
life becomes conscious and therefore aware of itself? Is it not
possible that Being will reject its own existence, seeing no
point to it all, and that thinking men will go on strike against
an evolutionary course which seems to have no real meaning and no
final purpose? Even now the world has split into two opposing
factions, and those in one faction say that life is not
worthwhile. Why bother, then, to go any further? These are the
pessimists; let us leave them behind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. That leaves the optimists, and they must choose
between the optimism of withdrawal and the optimism of evolution.
The optimists of withdrawal are the buddhists, who wish to quit
the world at once; they acknowledge that Being as Being is good,
but they deny that the awareness of true Being can be found in
the forward-looking world of appearances. There is nowhere to go,
they say. We are already there. The idea of a goal ahead is
delusional, they say, and we need only to realize this; the
solution, it follows, is to &quot;break away from the
evolutionary determinism, break the spell, withdraw.&quot; Let
them cut the threads, then, and let them retire to their
future-denying nirvana. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. That leaves the optimists of evolution:
&quot;the believers in some ultimate value in the tangible
evolution of things.&quot; They are faithful to the future,
&quot;faithful to Earth.&quot; But they too have a decision to
make, and their choice is between pluralism and monism. The
pluralists are concerned primarily with their personal freedom
and individual uniqueness, &quot;in opposition to others.&quot;
For the monists, &quot;nothing exists or finally matters except
the Whole.&quot; Which shall it be? &quot;This,&quot; said
Teilhard, &quot;is the ultimate choice, by way of which Mankind
must finally be divided, knowing its own mind.&quot; And
Teilhard, for his part, chose monism. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Only in union, said Teilhard, can man ever hope to
achieve his final destiny, and a separatist individualism is
ultimately self-destructive: &quot;the element burns up all its
future in a flying spark.&quot; Let us plunge forward into
monism, &quot;even though something in us perish.&quot; For it is
written that he who loses his soul shall save it&#151;and in true
associations, as opposed to collective heaps, the combination of
separate elements does not eliminate their differences. It exalts
them. As in the specialized cells of the body, &quot;true union
differentiates.&quot; This is true even in the case of the
anthill or beehive&#151;the palace of honey&#151;where
specialization is based upon such biological functions as
nutrition and reproduction. How much truer it must be, then, in
the case of a <i>spiritual</i> association in which individual
personalities will conspire together to create &quot;a common
consciousness.&quot; In such a union &quot;each element achieves
completeness, not directly in a separate consummation, but by
incorporation in a higher pole of consciousness in which alone it
can enter into contact with all others.&quot; Tillich was
expressing the same thought when he denied that union with the
Ground of Being means a loss of self in a larger whole. &quot;If
the self participates in the power of being-itself,&quot; said
Tillich, &quot;it receives itself back. For the power of being
acts through the power of the individual selves. It does not
swallow them as every limited whole, every collectivism, and
every conformism does.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Teilhard died before psychedelic quietism became an
issue, but his second set of alternatives&#151;withdrawal or
evolution&#151; goes nevertheless to the heart of that issue. And
Teilhard has not left us to wonder which of the two alternatives
he would recommend as the proper and logical choice. This is
implicit, he said, in the fact that life up to now has followed
&quot;a precise line of direction.&quot; There has been an
unmistakable progression toward an increase of consciousness and
a greater awareness. What we must do, therefore, is select that
path which points ahead in the same direction&#151;&quot;the one
which seems best able to develop and preserve in us the highest
degree of consciousness.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It might be argued that the meta-experience
represents an advanced level of consciousness, as opposed to a
regression, and it is possible even to interpret Eastern doctrine
as evolutionary. There is, for example, the concept of &quot;the
days and nights of Brahma,&quot; contained in the Hindu holy
book, the <i>Bhagavad-Gita</i>. This suggests the image mentioned
earlier of a games-playing God who acts out the cosmic drama for
his own amusement, pretending to be Many when actually he is One.
The drama continues for a thousand ages&#151;until the
Self-deception is at last revealed, and the One once more is
aware of his Oneness. Whereupon the whole cycle is repeated,
forever and ever. There is some support for this idea in the
modern astrophysical theory of an &quot;oscillating&quot;
universe, which holds that all of the galaxies comprising the
universe were once contained in a primordial atom of incredible
density. At some point in the past this atom exploded, sending
all the raw material of the universe flying out into
space&#151;the galaxies evolving with the passage of time. There
is considerable evidence that this so-called expansion of the
universe is still going on&#151;in fact there seems little doubt
of it&#151;but recent observations indicate that the outward
flight of the galaxies will one day slow to a stop, and the
universe will then contract again into a new primordial atom.
Indeed, the process may have occurred countless times already
since the dawn of creation. Or so we are told. The theory is
based, I believe, on the estimated force of the original impetus
and the estimated amount of stellar material. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt science has weighed and measured the
universe very accurately and thus can predict what it will do
some billions of years from now. But it might be easier to accept
the idea of oscillation as final if science were just a trifle
more accurate in predicting tomorrow's weather in Omaha. Will it
rain there or won't it? However that may be, we have already seen
the danger of marrying physics to metaphysics (in connection with
free will), and it is doubtful in any case that Eastern evolution
is anything like Western evolution. The Eastern future is not a
creative future, in the Western sense, but rather an eternal
repetition of the past. This does not mean the East is wrong and
the West is right, but it does mean there is an essential
difference in their assertions on this point. The Western future
is clearly denied both by Eastern metaphysics and by psychedelic
quietism. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shall we rest on our oars? Are we already there? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Addressing himself to the buddhists among us,
Teilhard agreed that the concept of an ultimate withdrawal from
the phenomenal rat race &quot;fits in very well with the <i>final</i>
demands of a world of evolutionary structure.&quot; But he made
one proviso: &quot;that the world in question shall have reached
a stage of development so advanced that its 'soul' can be
detached without losing any of its completeness, as something
wholly formed.&quot; And to this he added: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>But have we any reason to suppose that human consciousness
    <i>today</i> has achieved so high a degree of richness and
    perfection that it can derive nothing more from the sap of
    the earth? Again we may turn to history for an answer. Let us
    suppose, for example, that the strivings and the progress of
    civilization had come to an end at the time of Buddha, or in
    the first centuries of the Christian era. Can we believe that
    nothing essential, of vision and action and love, would have
    been lost to the Spirit of Earth? Clearly we cannot. And this
    simple observation alone suffices to guide our decision. So
    long as a fruit continues to grow and ripen we refrain from
    picking it. In the same way, so long as the world around us
    continues, even in suffering and disorder, to yield a harvest
    of problems, ideas and new forces, it is a sign that we must
    continue to press forward in the conquest of matter. Any
    immediate withdrawal . . . would certainly be premature. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He also said, elsewhere: &quot;God creates and
shapes us through the process of evolution.... God awaits us when
the evolutionary process is complete; to rise above the world,
therefore, does not mean to despise or reject it, but to pass
through it and sublime it.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Teilhard may or may not have demonstrated that
evolution has a goal or a purpose. It is possible, however, that
he did show evolution to have at least a direction, and that
alone would be no small gift in this age of uncertainty. Given a
sense of direction, if nothing else, there are many perhaps who
would be willing, in an act of faith, to accept the idea of an
unguessed future purpose. And after all, at this stage in our
development, who has the wisdom to deny that possibility? Is
anyone so all-knowing, when all of us together would seem to know
so little? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If we are estranged from one level of reality and
locked in a world of action, it may be that we are estranged for
a reason&#151;and a reason, moreover, which we cannot yet
foresee. If there is a Whole which is seeking to know itself, it
may be that the Whole aspires to a more perfect knowledge of its
parts as well as its Oneness&#151;that the Whole demands of us
that we first conquer the earth, moon, and stars before we turn
inward. If there is a deeper level of reality, revealed by
psychedelics, there could well be another level still deeper than
that. Anything and everything is possible, and nothing as yet is
impossible. This is not to say that the psychedelic insight is
not true; we are merely suggesting that it may not be the whole
truth. If a little learning is a dangerous thing, there is danger
indeed in any total commitment to a partial understanding, and
some of the drug cultists might at least be a little less
cavalier in their decision to reverse the apparent direction of
the universal tides. Perhaps some knowledge comes to us too soon,
before we know how to use it or what to make of it, as was
certainly true with the atom. But it is too late for regrets, in
the case of the atom or the case now at hand. A decision of some
sort must obviously be made, and it is essentially a very simple
decision&#151;though by no means an easy one. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Backward to OM? Or forward to Omega? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shall we accept the myth of the Demiurge, which
suggests that our salvation lies in the simple acceptance of the
here-now present moment&#151;concealed by the intellect? Or shall
we accept the myth of Ulysses, which suggests that life is a
process of evolutionary growth toward some distant future goal we
cannot as yet perceive? These are the central questions posed at
this time by the mystical, peak, and LSD experiences. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Teilhard felt that mankind as a whole has reached
its decision and has chosen its path. If that choice in fact has
been made, as he supposed, then it is much easier to understand
society's angry and dogmatic reaction to those uncompromising
individuals who insist that the meta-experience points toward a
total withdrawal and nowhere else. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Ulysses found his men feeding upon the flowery
food, in the land of the lotus eaters, he did not pause for
thought. He asked them no questions, and he offered them no
arguments. He laid hold of the men, and he led them, weeping and
sore against their will, back to the swift ships. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He knew where he was going. He was going to Ithaca.

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>&quot;Four o'clock, and all's wrong.&quot;</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So says the voice on the tape recorder as I listen
to it now. My voice. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Having been reminded often enough of those
schoolmen who would not look through Galileo's telescope, I
participated in a psychedelic experiment on May 16, 1966, at the
Ridgeway psychiatric hospital in Chicago. Present were Dr. A. I.
Jackman, a psychiatrist; Dr. Herbert Maltz, clinical director of
the hospital, and a psychedelic guide I shall refer to here as
Jim. We used Huxley's drug, mescaline, because LSD at that time
had been taken off the legal market. The two produce identical
effects, I was told, the only difference being that a much
stronger dosage is required in the case of mescaline, which is
administered in milligrams rather than micrograms. I was first
given a thorough medical examination, including an
electrocardiogram, and we then retired to a small but pleasantly
furnished consultation room on the second floor of the hospital,
where the drapes were drawn against the afternoon sunlight. At 2
P.M. Dr. Jackman handed me a paper cup of water and five white
capsules, each of them containing seventy milligrams of
mescaline; a half-hour later I took two more capsules, for a
total dose of 490 milligrams. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing happened for more than an hour. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before going further, I should speak very briefly
about myself and various subjective factors which may have
influenced my reaction to the drug. While I had always been
interested in the implications of religious perception, I was not
normally given to mystical states of mind; some slight
significance might be attached here, however, to a phenomenon I
had experienced occasionally since early childhood. This would
happen once or twice a year, I suppose, and would last ten or
fifteen seconds at most. In moments of abstraction, my immediate
environment would suddenly appear to take on a new and wordless
meaning I could not define; time would stop, all objects would
lose their names, and the world would seem somehow peaceful and
perfect. The landscape would first appear to blur, as if the film
in a movie projector had jumped its track, and then it would come
clear again in a slightly different focus: it would look quite
the same as before, but in some subtle way its meaning would have
changed. Just how is hard to say. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had always had vivid memories of my infancy,
including a few sunlit memories of the cradle itself in the very
first days of my life, and the experience often reminded me of
those pristine recollections&#151;of that holy time, at the dawn
of life, when I lay innocent in sunbeams. Curiously, certain
pieces of music would often serve to evoke the experience: <i>Clair
de lune</i>, for one, which I always associated with sunlight,
and &quot;Zing Went the Strings of My Heart.&quot; I never
supposed that the experience was important, and I never mentioned
it to anybody, although I did give it a name. I called it
&quot;the Shift.&quot; I had never heard of a peak experience, of
course, and maybe it was something of the sort; maybe it was a
pint-size <i>satori</i>. In any case, it occurred less frequently
as I grew older. I became a newspaperman, and newspapermen are
not very mystical. I was taught to be critical and objective, and
I was prepared to be both when I swallowed the seven capsules. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The atmosphere of a psychiatric hospital was far
from ideal for a psychedelic setting, but I knew at least that I
was in good hands should anything go wrong, and I felt no
apprehension whatever about taking the drug. In fact, I had been
looking forward to it. I had read many accounts of good trips and
bad trips, and I fully expected to experience an ego loss, but
that prospect didn't trouble me. Finally, I should point out that
I had recently been reading a fair amount of Eastern literature,
and indeed I had just reread the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After about seventy minutes, Jim told me, &quot;You
look different.&quot; I asked him in what way I looked different,
and he said, &quot;You're somehow younger.&quot; I smiled and
pointed to a framed picture hanging on one wall. &quot;That water
stain on the left-hand side of the glass,&quot; I said. &quot;Was
that there before?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I think something is beginning to happen to
you,&quot; said Dr. Jackman. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Twenty minutes later I felt a numbness creeping
over my body, and I said that I seemed to be losing my muscular
control. &quot;But again, nothing special.&quot; I yawned and
added: &quot;That's interesting. The coffee in this cup looks
green . . . sort of a greenish cast to it.&quot; I had been
chain-smoking cigarettes, and I told Jim apologetically: &quot;I
don't want to put out the last cigarette. I'm such a smoker. I
keep thinking just one more cigarette before . . .&quot; Jim
reached down and switched on a tape recorder, filling the room
with symphonic music set at low volume. That annoyed me for some
reason. It seemed prearranged. &quot;Jim,&quot; I told him,
&quot;your whiskers have got a greenish tint to them.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had been sitting on a long couch, my knees
crossed, head nodding. I felt so weak and listless, as if I
hadn't slept for days. &quot;Jim,&quot; I said, &quot;did you
usually start with visual things? I've been waiting for
colors.&quot; I looked down at my tweed jacket and my
green-and-white striped shirt, then farther down at my crossed
legs. Black pants, black socks, black shoes. The only trouble
was, the legs weren't mine. They looked alien and somehow
sinister. I knew they were attached to my body, and I knew I
could move them, but they weren't my legs. They weren't me. Or
better yet, I wasn't <i>them</i>. It was just as if I were
looking at the legs of some stranger sitting next to me in a bar,
or on a train. So primly crossed. So black. And the silk-hosed
ankles, so damned self-satisfied. I didn't like them at all.
&quot;I didn't think my legs looked like that,&quot; I said.
&quot;I thought they looked different . . . but the point is, I'm
about one quarter-inch outside myself now. That's how I feel, I
mean. I'm sitting here, but I've also moved about a quarter-inch
outside my body, and that's why I can look at my body now and see
it just the same way other people see it. Funny, too. I'd
expected all these visual things first. Colors . . .
jewels.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So tired. So numb. Just one more cigarette. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jim helped me off with my jacket and shoes, and I
stretched out on the couch. I complained again about my lack of
motor control, and Dr. Maltz had me tug at his fingers and then
press my open palm against his palm in an effort to resist it.
&quot;You have not actually lost any strength,&quot; he said.
Then he tested me with a pin, jabbing at the back of my hand with
the dull end and sharp end. I told him each time which end it
was, and finally I said, &quot;That hurt&#151;but so what?&quot;
I felt the pain, but it didn't matter. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jim had turned up the music. The whole long-playing
tape seemed to be Beethoven, and I didn't like it. The <i>Eroica</i>
in particular sounded ponderous and threatening. Nothing human
there; it was pure mathematics, written on Olympus. &quot;Feel
good,&quot; I said. &quot;Feel different. It's like, ah . .
.&quot; I opened my eyes. &quot;I feel like I got great big
hands. You know? When I open my eyes, I'm back in the room. And
everything looks normal. When I close them, though, I feel sort
of disembodied. And I'm not sure yet which way I want to go.
Maybe I'd rather stay here and watch it happen. I have the
feeling I'd drift off if I closed my eyes. It's just a question
of whether I want to get disembodied or not. I have the feeling
that . . . I have the feeling that . . . It's very relaxing.
Especially in the small of the back. It's like I'm floating in
clouds without any body, and it's very nice to get rid of your
body. I feel this loss of weight and loss of tension, like it all
ran out of me. Especially in the small of the back. That's where
I'd localize it. It's like I drank a hundred martinis without
passing out. Still able to think and remember. It's like being
drunk without being drunk. You know? But just the same, I don't
feel all that great . . . feel different.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I rolled to one side and started to repeat the
first-person pronoun, nominative case. &quot;I, I, I . . . I, I,
I . . . I, I, I . . . Ai, Ai, Ai . . . Yi, Yi, Yi . . .
Ai-Yi-Yi-Yi . . . Yo, Yo, Yo . . . Yo, Yo, Yo . . . Spanish for I
. . . Yo, Yo, Yo . . . Yo-Yo, Yo-Yo . . . capitalized trademark .
. . Duncan Yo-Yo . . . That's it, we're all Duncan Yo-Yos.
Spanish word for I, means we're all a bunch of Yo-Yos. Up and
down on a string. Conclusive proof of Leary's Game Theory.... But
not really, of course.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Struck by a sudden thought, I sat up in alarm. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;What happened?&quot;' I asked. &quot;What
happened to all the other people?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was still puzzling that over when my gaze fell
again on the cold black dregs in my coffee cup. I stuck a finger
in the coffee and became a continuum with it and the plastic cup.
&quot;Ah, it feels so good . . . so good. I feel real good. Dr.
Jackman, you're a Yo-Yo.&quot; I knew I was being obnoxious, and
I didn't like that, either. &quot;When does everything start to
get exquisite?&quot; I asked. &quot;Nothing I expected has
happened yet. This is a bore, so far.&quot; I fell back
helplessly on the couch, and Dr. Jackman told me, &quot;You're
just at the beginning.&quot; &quot;The beginning?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I drifted off, mumbling incoherently, and the
doctors left. I was alone now with Jim. &quot;Poor little
world,&quot; I said. &quot;Poor little world . . . poor little
world.&quot; Later I opened my eyes and found that Jim had gone,
too. I sat up and looked around for him, rubbing my eyes with my
fists. But the room was deserted. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Jim? Did you go away, Jim, or are you really
here? Maybe you're still here, and I just can't see you. Could it
actually happen? Of course it couldn't. But then, how can I tell?
I'm under the influence of a drug. Oh, you shouldn't have gone
away, Jim. Did you go away, or didn't you? Are you there, Jim?
Where are you?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The door opened. Jim came in. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I went to the washroom,&quot; he said.
&quot;Is something the matter?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;Everything's
fine.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A nurse brought us a meal, which we ate at the
desk. Corned beef hash, apricots, sliced pickles, and another pot
of coffee. I shoveled the food down impersonally, much as you
would stoke a furnace, and the process of eating seemed highly
humorous. Biting into the pickles, I could sense their molecular
structure; I had a mouth full of cells and atoms, I thought, and
I could feel my teeth grinding them about. How ridiculous chewing
was. It would have been much easier, I thought, simply to slip
the pickles in through my ribs. I knew it wouldn't work if I
tried it, but I thought nevertheless that it should work. After
all, there was no such thing as a solid; there were only those
spinning atoms, which in turn were only sparks of energy
(whatever that was), and the emptiness of the atomic inner space
must surely be calculated in millions and billions of micromiles.
I stuck my finger in the coffee again&#151;it was hot this time,
but that didn't matter&#151;and I imagined that the end of my
finger had disappeared. I laughed and said that Huxley hadn't
turned into a coffee cup, had he? I, on the other hand, had just
turned into a coffee cup. Which is to say, I and the coffee cup
were the same thing, really; where the one ended, the other
began. The coffee cup, you might say, had turned into me.
Certainly the pickles and hash had turned into me, and those
Hindus clearly had known what they were talking about: it was all
a case of food living on food, and after that becoming food. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the meal I lay down again and shut my eyes.
In the darkness of my mind I saw a Technicolor display of
weird-looking growths waving about, like plants in a current at
the bottom of the sea. There were stalks and sponges and
fan-shaped objects: pink and green and purple. I thought I might
wander around down there for several centuries, and I wasn't at
all sure that I wanted to. I thought about my family, and it
didn't seem fair to go away so long and leave them
behind&#151;like Rip Van Winkle. What if they needed me for
something, and what if they were all dead when I finally came
back? &quot;Those are organisms,&quot; I said, imagining now that
I had recognized the growths. &quot;I am looking inside my own
eyeball. And those all are parts of my eyeball.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then I lay still for a time, drifting, and Jim
supposed that I was past the point of no return, comfortable and
happy. Coming up quietly, he slipped a set of stereophonic
earphones onto my head, the big foam-rubber phones snapping over
my ears in a snug fit. A majestic Beethoven chord exploded inside
my brain, and I instantly disappeared. My body no longer existed,
and neither did the world. The world and I had been utterly
annihilated. I could feel the pressure of the earphones; but in
the space between the phones, where my head should have been,
there was absolutely nothing . . . <i>nothing!</i> I was Mind
alone, lost in an icy blue grotto of sound. There was only the
music, and then bright colors that turned out to be musical
notes. The notes danced along a silver staff of music that
stretched from one eternity to another, beyond the planets and
stars and space itself. Red notes. Blue notes. But they had no
substance or dimension, and nothing was real in that empty cavern
between the two earphones. That unbounded abyss. The music rolled
on in orgiastic waves of sound and color, and then I myself was
one of the notes. I was being swept along on the silver staff, at
twice the speed of light, rushing farther and farther away from
my home back there in the Milky Way. In desperation, at the last
possible moment, I reached up with hands I did not own, and I
tore off the earphones. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was back in the room. But from that point on, it
went wrong. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I sat in a chair, staring at the floor. Jim pulled
back the drapes, filling the room with the last light of day.
Outside in the streets I could hear auto horns honking, and once
a fire engine went by. I felt a terrible depression rising slowly
from the bottom of my soul. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Even out here where I am,&quot; I said,
&quot;I don't know what's going on.&quot; Nobody knew what was
going on. Nobody knew anything. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed to me that my sense of self was
completely gone now. It had been ripped away by the music, and I
had come back without it. Although I knew nothing, I felt that
some awful truth was about to be revealed to me. It was lurking
somewhere just beyond the borders of my comprehension, and very
soon now I should have to come face to face with it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I studied the room, and I realized that I now
formed a continuum with everything in sight. The room seemed to
shimmer in the dying rays of sunlight, and I was aware once more
of the atomic substructure that underlay the visible world of the
senses. It struck me that the visible world was wholly real, and
in no way a deception, but it nevertheless had this underlying
structure which glowed and pulsed like a living force. And it all
ran together in a single composition. This is hard to describe,
and the only analogy I can think of is in painting&#151;for
example, Seurat's huge pointillist canvas, &quot;A Sunday
Afternoon on the Grande Jatte.&quot; The figures on the grass are
real enough, and there is a logic to their placement and
development; if you look closely, however, you will see that the
figures and the grass and the sparkling water are all composed of
tiny dots of color, and these dots all blend together to form a
single scene and a single reality. The lady with her parasol
looks out at the sailboats on the water, and she imagines perhaps
that they are far away and separate; but everything on the canvas
is inexorably locked together in one flowing creation, and the
lady in fact is an extension of the parasol, water, and boats. I
thought of that canvas as I sat in the room, drugged out of my
mind, and it seemed to me that I was locked into my scene just as
inexorably as Seurat's figures were locked into theirs. Dots of
energy or dots of paint, it was all the same. But even this
seemed unsatisfactory, the more I thought of it, and then I
remembered those Van Gogh canvases in which sky and earth swirl
together like magnetic force fields. &quot;That's it,&quot; I
thought. &quot;The reality that flows . . . much better than
dots.&quot; And I pitied poor Van Gogh, if that was his constant
perception. Those raging cypress trees, like tongues of green
flame licking at the heavens&#151;those whirling suns. No wonder
he cut off his ear. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I tried to explain it to Jim. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Instead of trying to figure it out,&quot; he
said, &quot;just try to feel what's happening.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I didn't like what was happening. I was
starting to remember something, and it seemed to have some
connection with sunlight and a cradle. But what could it be? Then
it came to me that I was gradually remembering my own identity,
like an amnesia victim who slowly recovers his past. Finally it
all fell together, and I remembered who I was. And it was so
simple, really. I was life. I was Being. I was the vibrant force
that filled the room, and was the room. I was the world, the
universe. I was everything. I was that which always was and
always would be. I was Jim, and Jim was me, and we were everybody
else; and everybody else was us, and all of us put together were
the same thing, and that same thing was the only thing there was.
We were not God. We were simply all that there was, and all that
there was wasn't God. It was us, alone. And we were each other,
and nowhere anywhere was there anything else but us, and we were
always the same, the one and only truth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Jim,&quot; I said, &quot;can you get me out
of this?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Uh-huh. You want to try it another
half-hour?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;Let's try it another
half-hour.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Having been reunited with the Ground of my Being, I
wanted urgently to be estranged from it again as quickly as
possible. But I tried to hold on, at least for a while, and I
tried to laugh at the terrifying idea that was building up in my
mind. &quot;I don't want to be God,&quot; I said. &quot;I don't
even want to be city editor.&quot; But it did no good to laugh,
and I stopped trying. Of course I wasn't God, I knew that. But I
was All That There Was, and I didn't want to be that, either. It
was dark now, and I could hear children playing somewhere outside
the hospital&#151; under a street lamp, no doubt&#151;and their
lonely voices filled me with sadness. <i>The children</i>, I
thought. The children, and Jim, and me: we were all the God there
was. And it was sad and awful, because I wanted there to be a
God. For the children at least, if not for me. But the loss of
God was not the worst of it; there was something far worse even
than that. The loss of my little self was not the worst of it;
nor indeed did I regret that at all. It was not what I had lost.
It was what I had gained. I had gained the whole universe, it
seemed, and that was more than I could cope with&#151;more than I
could bear. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I didn't want it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But who was I, who didn't want it? I was Everybody,
the Self. And now I knew what the little selves were for, I
thought. They were a fiction designed to protect the Self from
the knowledge of its own Being&#151;to keep the Self from going
mad. For surely, without them, the Self might be driven to
insanity by the thought of its own audacity, and the thought of
its loneliness, and the thought as well of the danger it was in.
And it <i>was</i> in danger, I knew that perfectly well. Since it
was All That There Was, there was nothing to assure it of its own
immortality. And in fact, I could sense, there was that which
resisted both its Being and Becoming. And this something was
nothing more than Nothingness itself, against which the Self had
exerted its will to Become. Thus the ontic anxiety, as Tillich
expressed it: the ultimate fear of ultimate non-Being. Or so it
seemed, as I struggled with my seven demons; and translating the
Self into selves once more, I imagined that I now understood with
perfect clarity the meaning of a passage that had always haunted
me in Unamuno's story of the good priest Don Emmanuel. That
saintly man had preached to his flock the word of God and the
message of salvation, which gave them great joy. There were
those, however, who perceived that Don Emmanuel himself was a
tormented soul, and one day, while walking in the countryside, a
villager named Lazarus begged the priest to tell him the
truth&#151;the truth above all! And all a-tremble, Don Emmanuel
whispered into the ear of him who had asked: &quot;The truth? The
truth, Lazarus, is perhaps something so unbearable, so terrible,
something so deadly, that simple people could not live with
it!&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now I thought that I knew this truth: the deadly
and unbearable truth that <i>nobody created us . . . we created
ourselves</i>. That was the horror that we could not live with, I
thought&#151; anything rather than that&#151;and I raved to Jim:
&quot;Tell the truth now, Jim. There is no God, is there? Oh God.
It's awfully hard. Why does life have to be so hard? Why can't
everything be nice? Oh God . . . God. I don't want life to be
this way. Oh God, I can't face this. I'm not ready. I'm not
ready. I don't have what it takes. I don't have the courage to
meet it.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jim said: &quot;It's an illusion we build up from
the time we're little kids. We don't often encounter&#151;&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Shut up!</i> &quot;It's too soon, too soon. Too
soon, I tell you. Oh God, we're not supposed to look at this. Not
now. Maybe in a million years, or a billion years, or ten billion
years. But not now, not yet. It was wrong to do this. The drug .
. . not right . . . we shouldn't be fooling with . . .&quot; My
voice trailed off, and I thought about Freud. I thought that
Freud didn't know what he was talking about, and the unconscious
was very simple, really: the unconscious was this knowledge I now
had of ultimate Being, and our repressions of it had their roots
in an existential terror, not neurosis. It was real, and it was
horrifying. It was more than most of us could accept, and thus we
took refuge in smaller identities and well-defined roles,
creating a limited world we could comfortably live in, pretending
all the time there was Something Else. But there was nothing
else, and deep down inside us we knew it, and we suffered. It
took courage to Be, just as Tillich said, and most of us didn't
have that courage. So we rejected our Being&#151;and not by
killing ourselves, because death was impossible, but by denying
our real identity. By refusing to face what we actually were. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Jim,&quot; I said, &quot;we're all there
is.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;That's right, buddy boy.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;God, you're tough. You don't look it, but
you're really tough. I just wish that I . . . Jim . . . Can you
get me out of this?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Sure. Want to try another half-hour
first?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;All right. Another half-hour.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All That There Was. But even this&#151;<i>even this</i>&#151;was
not the worst of it. I said that I was frightened by what I had
gained, and this was true. But I had lost something, too, and it
was more important to me than my wretched self, and more
important even than God. For along with my own self I had lost
all the other selves as well. I had lost other people. And I
missed them very much. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wanted there to be someone else. Anyone else. And
if there had been just two of us&#151;really two of us&#151;and
we two were All That There Was, that would not have been so hard.
But there was no one else; there was only the One. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sitting in that room, I could hear church bells
ringing somewhere, a long way off, and I imagined that they were
Christmas bells. I thought of the holiday season, and the crowds
thronging the downtown streets in the winter night, and the
stores all aglow like boxes of light. Snow falling, and carols
playing on the loudspeakers. And everyone with a home to go to,
and someone there to meet him, and maybe to love him. But someone
else, in any case. I was not feeling sentimental about Christmas
as such; I was thinking rather about the crowds of
people&#151;all of them real, all of them different. And I missed
them so, the people. More than myself, more than God, more than
anything. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It wasn't right, I thought. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Jim,&quot; I said, &quot;get me out of
this.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So he got the Thorazine, and he got me out of it.
And the doctors let me go home, where there was someone to meet
me. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I'm not going to hurt anybody,&quot; I said.
&quot;I'm just going to hurt.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I did, too, for several days. Then the mood wore
off, and I went back to the world I knew, and I worked in it.
Sometimes I would catch glimpses of that different world I had
seen in the hospital room, and I would wonder if the experience
was going to start all over again. But it never did. There was
only one time, when I was flying alone in a little airplane, high
over the Illinois prairie. Shut up in the cabin, I felt suddenly
trapped and afraid, and more alone than I cared to be. But I
dropped down out of the clouds to a lower altitude, and I opened
a window, and the feeling passed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Looking back on the experience, I recall several
things. For one, I never forgot that I was under the influence of
a drug. For another, I was never wholly convinced that the drug's
revelations were true; even during the best moments and worst
moments, a part of me warned that the truth might lie elsewhere,
and I suppose this was my reporter's instinct expressing itself.
For example, the monistic phase might well have been initiated by
my momentary panic when Jim left me alone in the room. And my
pre-experience reading could perhaps explain my failure to detect
any hint of a transcendent reality. Also, I remember a persistent
conviction that the experience itself was wrong. Not false,
necessarily, but wrong. For some unguessed reason, I felt, it
would be better for us not to seek the experience, at least at
this time. And finally, whether my phantoms were real or unreal,
I regret my cowardice in the face of them: I have the feeling
somehow that they might have appeared much friendlier had it been
in my power really to confront them. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I include this epilogue simply as an item of
interest, if it is, and certainly not as a testament. Obviously
there were too many unknown factors involved to draw any
conclusions from the experience, and for my part I have not drawn
any conclusions. Nevertheless, and just the same, it is something
to think about. I shall think about it for the rest of my life. </p>

<H3>Commentary on William Braden's Mescaline Experience</H3>
<H4>by Peter Webster</H4></CENTER><HR>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
How is it possible for two persons of such obvious intellectual
talent as William Braden and Aldous Huxley to have such radically
different experiences as a result of ingestion of a similar quantity
of mescaline? Both Huxley and Braden brought to their first psychedelic
experiment a wide knowledge and understanding of science, religion,
mysticism, literature and fine arts, yet Huxley's initial psychedelic
experience was a revelation, and led to the writing of <I>The
Doors of Perception, </I>a book which launched a movement, if
not a revolution. William Braden's experiment, recounted in the
Postscript of his book, <I>The Private Sea, </I>could not have
been more opposite to Huxley's. Anguish and torment forced Mr.
Braden to ask that the experience be terminated with the anti-psychotic
drug Thorazine, and several days of painful recovery, he tells
us, ensued.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The so-called &quot;bad trip&quot; has been the occasional result
in both psychedelic research and the clandestine use of psychedelics
since the 1950s. Authorities of all persuasions have warned us
of the ever-present risk, and that it is next to impossible to
predict if a given personality will experience the negative aspect
of psychedelic experience. It has also often been observed that
a bad experience may even follow several positive, ecstatic ones,
for no apparent reason. Even the careful control of the supposed
principal determinants of the experience, <I>set and setting,</I>
seems to leave a way open for negative experience, and indicates
a crucial lack in the understanding of how and why a bad experience
may arise. Or so it has been repeatedly said.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The set and setting hypothesis may fail to provide control or
understanding of the occurrence of negative experience for a very
good reason: Although many investigators have attempted to understand
the content of psychedelic experience solely in terms of the set
and setting of the experiment, I feel there is more of tautology
than scientific theory in this &quot;explanation.&quot; Saying
that the psychedelic experience depends on set and setting is
rather like saying that the weather is dependent on the contents
of the atmosphere. The weather <I>IS</I> the contents of the atmosphere,
and the psychedelic experience <I>IS</I> the set and setting of
the time and place in which the psychedelic drug is taken. This
is, of course, the case with everyday experience as well: the
set and setting of your day at the office <I>IS</I> the experience
of your day at the office. The set and setting hypothesis really
&quot;explains&quot; nothing we don't already know. We will have
to delve a little deeper than a comparison of the set and setting
of the experiences of Braden and Huxley to understand the extreme
difference of result.<P>
<CENTER>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</CENTER>
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There has been a continuing ignorance by a great many of the players
in the psychedelic controversy concerning the experience of tribal
man, both past and present. The visionary realms sometimes attained
through the use of psychedelic drugs have been visited since time
immemorial, and for a modern researcher to ignore what tribal
man has to say on the subject of psychedelic experience is a serious
oversight. Especially guilty have been those on the side of Prohibition
of the psychedelic drugs, whether government minister or categorically-abstinent
researcher: the great majority of persons who have themselves
experienced the psychedelic vision have subsequently educated
themselves on the subject of shamanism and the use of psychedelic
plants by the tribal practitioners of early medicine and religion.
At the same time the Prohibitionists, including some eminent researchers,
have gone so far as to insist that those having themselves taken
psychedelics are irrevocably tainted, and incapable of judging
the results of their own investigations. The very existence of
such an attitudinal conflict among trained thinkers suggests that
modern rationality may not be all that it is cracked up to be,
and might also be an intimation of at least one of the sources
of negative psychedelic experience.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
If one starts, of course, with the premise that tribal man is
primitive, ignorant, backward, incapable of rational thought,
lost in delusion, etc., then a complete disregard for the hundred-thousand
years (or more) of tribal psychedelic research follows. Such a
premise may play an important and stifling role in the outlook
of many moderns, even those who believe themselves far more broad-minded,
as the roots of prejudice are notoriously difficult to uncover.
But the brain of <I>Homo sapiens</I> has had exactly its present
macroscopic and neurological structure for at least 150 thousand
years, and although early man of course did not have the (not
all that certain) advantage of modern culture as a tool, it is
preposterous to believe that a nervous system capable of creating
symphonies and relativity theories was simply not employed to
full capacity before modern times. Evolution does not work like
that. The human brain would not have evolved to its present capability
had there been no aboriginal use for all that symphony- and relativity-theory-producing
hardware. The chronic skeptic will demand, &quot;well what do
you propose those primitives were doing with all that hardware?&quot;
If we would listen to them, instead of eradicate them, we might
begin to know.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Many modern thinkers, of course, <I>have</I> been listening. But
they are not usually among the cohort of institutional professionals
who practice hard, reductionist science. They are rather specialists
on mythology such as Joseph Campbell, anthropologists such as
Michael Harner, ethno-botanists such as Gordon Wasson and Richard
Evans Schultes, or psychedelic researchers such as Humphrey Osmond
and Albert Hofmann. Recognition of such pioneers by mainstream
science and society, not to mention Nobel Prizes and the like,
will not likely occur soon. Yet these are the very workers, and
fields of endeavor, which we must listen to very closely not only
to understand what early man has to say, but also to understand
the nature of the psychedelic experience and cause of the occasional
&quot;bad trip.&quot; Only by listening to the psychedelic wisdom
of the ages have we a chance for understanding how we moderns
fit into this very large picture. In evolutionary time, we are
but a mere blip, an exaggeration, perhaps an aberration which
might well soon self-destruct for lack of ageless wisdom, for
lack of listening to our ancestors who, with perceptions and thoughts
every bit as human, and every bit as potent as our own, ensured
human survival for greater than 99% of the time of human life
on earth.<P>
<CENTER>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</CENTER>
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
A principal lesson from the psychedelic past, which applies not
only to the use of visionary plants but to the optimal structuring
of society itself, is the importance of myth and ritual, both
for daily and seasonal life, and for the seeking of ultimate or
mystical understanding by a tribe or people. Today there are many
who would deny the importance, or even the presence of myth and
ritual as an underlying factor in their lives. But as with the
atheist, such denial is as much a mythology and ritual as the
denial of God by the atheist is in a very real sense, a religion:
An equivalent amount of faith is required to believe that God
does <I>not</I> exist (for there can be no absolute proof either
way).
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
A great and modern myth is that we no longer live by myths, but
hard facts, and perhaps peoples of all times and places found
it difficult to <I>know</I> the myths they lived by, the underlying
paradigm of their metaphysic. But the principal difference with
all tribal peoples as compared to us moderns, was that they all,
without fail, developed elaborate ritual and shamanism as a central
guiding framework for their lives. The myth and ritual of tribal
man was a living, evolving, all-encompassing structure, continually
being added to, and providing the long-term practical <I>and</I>
metaphysical understanding which kept such societies stable and
functioning for periods of time which make a mockery of modern
societal systems. For ritual today we have very primitive and
impotent relics indeed: empty &quot;religious&quot; charades on
the one hand, and a cut-throat tooth-and-nail paradigm of capitalistic
competition to the death as our day-to-day program for survival.
And compounding such a sickness-producing paradigm, the conviction
that we live by truth alone! If these be our myths and rituals,
we do not need to take psychedelics to experience a bad trip,
for we are already on one.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The primary importance of myth and ritual for understanding the
psychedelic experience, as well as for structuring psychedelic
experiments is today illustrated most forcefully by the use of
peyote by the Native American Church. In the ceremonies of the
NAC, quite powerful doses of peyote are often ingested, and &quot;bad
trips&quot; essentially never occur. The few documented cases
of negative result have uniformly involved a misuse of the sacrament
outside of NAC ceremonies, non-compliance with the wisdom of the
<I>road-men </I>or psychedelic guides for the ceremonies, or the
simultaneous use of alcohol. Within the structure of the NAC,
the peyote sacrament has continually been a very powerful and
efficacious one: by the definition of <I>sacrament</I> which we
use in the Christian tradition, peyote seems to many to be far
more the genuine article than the wine or bread, whose potency
one must take on faith alone. (Note that the mescaline which Huxley
and Braden ingested, is the main active component of peyote.)
So let's get this straight: the primitive, backward, ignorant,
irrational Indian, laboring under a childish and simplistic religious
paradigm, can ingest heroic quantities of a potent &quot;hallucinogen&quot;
and derive the most positive, reliable, reproducible and in every
sense of the word, <I>human</I> effects from this &quot;risky&quot;
behavior; yet one of us modern, rational, truth-loving supermen
know not whether the same dose might send us permanently over
the brink and into the looney-bin. I detect a faulty paradigm
somewhere.<P>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Aldous Huxley writes in <I>Heaven and Hell</I>, a book written
two years after <I>The Doors of Perception:</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have spoken so far only of the blissful visionary experience
and of its interpretation in terms of theology, its translation
into art. But visionary experience is not always blissful. It
is sometimes terrible. There is hell as well as heaven.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Like heaven, the visionary hell has its praeternatural light and
its praeternatural significance. But the significance is intrinsically
appalling and the light is 'the smoky light' of the <I>Tibetan
Book of the Dead</I>, the 'darkness visible' of Milton. In the
<I>Journal d'une Schizophrene</I>, the autobiographical record
of a young girl's passage through madness, the world of the schizophrenic
is called <I>le Pays d'Eclairement </I>- 'the country of lit-upness.'
It is a name which a mystic might have used to denote his heaven.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But for poor Ren&eacute;e, the schizophrenic, the illumination
is infernal - an intense electric glare without a shadow, ubiquitous
and implacable. Everything that, for healthy visionaries, is a
source of bliss, brings to Renee only fear and a nightmarish sense
of unreality. The summer sunshine is malignant; the gleam of polished
surfaces is suggestive, not of gems, but of machinery and enamelled
tin; the intensity of existence which animates every object, when
seen at close range and out of its utilitarian context, is felt
as a menace.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
And then there is the horror of infinity. For the healthy visionary,
the perception of the infinite in a finite particular is a revelation
of divine immanence; for Ren&eacute;e, it was a revelation of
what she calls 'the System,' the vast cosmic mechanism which exists
only to grind out guilt and punishment, solitude and unreality.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Sanity is a matter of degree, and there are plenty of visionaries
who see the world as Ren&eacute;e saw it, but contrive, none the
less, to live outside the asylum. For them, as for the positive
visionary, the universe is transfigured - but for the worse. Everything
in it, from the stars in the sky to the dust under their feet,
is unspeakably sinister or disgusting every event is charged with
a hateful significance every object manifests the presence of
an Indwelling Horror, infinite, all-powerful, eternal.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This negatively transfigured world has found its way, from time
to time, into literature and the arts. It writhed and threatened
in Van Gogh's later landscapes; it was the setting and the theme
of all Kafka's stories; it was Gericault's spiritual home; it
was inhabited by Goya during the years of his deafness and solitude;
it was glimpsed by Browning when he wrote Childe Roland; it had
its place, over against the theophanies, in the novels of Charles
Williams.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The negative visionary experience is often accompanied by bodily
sensations of a very special and characteristic kind. Blissful
visions are generally associated with a sense of separation from
the body, a feeling of deindividualization. (It is, no doubt,
this feeling of deindividualization which makes it possible for
the Indians who practise the peyote cult to use the drug not merely
as a short cut to the visionary world, but also as an instrument
for creating a loving solidarity within the participating group.)
When the visionary experience is terrible and the world is transfigured
for the worse, individualization is intensified and the negative
visionary finds himself associated with a body that seems to grow
progressively more dense, more tightly packed, until he finds
himself at last reduced to being the agonized consciousness of
an inspissated lump of matter, no bigger than a stone that can
be held between the hands.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It is worth remarking, that many of the punishments described
in the various accounts of hell are punishments of pressure and
constriction. Dante's sinners are buried in mud, shut up in the
trunks of trees, frozen solid in blocks of ice, crushed beneath
stones. The Inferno is psychologically true. Many of its pains
are experienced by schizophrenics, and by those who have taken
mescalin or lysergic acid under unfavourable conditions.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
What is the nature of these unfavourable conditions? How and why
is heaven turned into hell? In certain cases the negative visionary
experience is the result of predominantly physical causes. Mescalin
tends, after ingestion, to accumulate in the liver. If the liver
is diseased, the associated mind may find itself in hell. But
what is more important for our present purposes is the fact that
negative visionary experience may be induced by purely psychological
means. Fear and anger bar the way to the heavenly Other World
and plunge the mescalin taker into hell.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
And what is true of the mescalin taker is also true of the person
who sees visions spontaneously or under hypnosis. Upon this psychological
foundation has been reared the theological doctrine of saving
faith - a doctrine to be met with in all the great religious traditions
of the world. Eschatologists have always found it difficult to
reconcile their rationality and their morality with the brute
facts of psychological experience. As rationalists and moralists,
they feel that good behaviour should be rewarded and that the
virtuous deserve to go to heaven. But as psychologists they know
that virtue is not the sole or sufficient condition of blissful
visionary experience. They know that works alone are powerless
and that it is faith, or loving confidence, which guarantees that
visionary experience shall be blissful.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Negative emotions - the fear which is the absence of confidence,
the hatred, anger or malice which exclude love - are the guarantee
that visionary experience, if and when it comes, shall be appalling.
The Pharisee is a virtuous man; but his virtue is of the kind
which is compatible with negative emotion. His visionary experiences
are therefore likely to be infernal rather than blissful.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The nature of the mind is such that the sinner who repents and
makes an act of faith in a higher power is more likely to have
a blissfull visionary experience than is the self-satisfied pillar
of society with his righteous indignations, his anxiety about
possessions and pretensions, his ingrained habits of blaming,
despising and condemning&#133;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In <I>The Doors of Perception</I> Huxley reveals the secret in
an even clearer way (at this stage, he recounts his experience
at the height of the mescaline's effect):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
'If you started in the wrong way,' I said in answer to the investigator's
questions, 'everything that happened would be a proof of the conspiracy
against you. It would all be self-validating. You couldn't draw
a breath without knowing it was part of the plot.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
'So you think you know where madness lies ?'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
My answer was a convinced and heartfelt, 'Yes.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
'And you couldn't control it?'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
'No, I couldn't control it. If one began with fear and hate as
the major premiss, one would have to go on to the conclusion.'
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Young people who have explored consciousness with the aid of psychedelic
drugs have usually done so in a spirit of love, love of adventure,
love of exploration, love of freedom, love of community... The
older, &quot;wiser&quot; folk of today more often explore for
competitive or compulsive reasons, for fame, to achieve, to ascend
the ladder of success, to cement preconceptions into certainties...
Such exploration is often mixed with a compulsive or chronic skepticism,
constructed perhaps from previous entrapment in folly during youth.
Arthur Koestler was deceived into supporting the Communist movement
in Russia for a time, even after he had toured the country and
seen, not the desolation that he should have, but instead believed
the empty promises of the doctrine he had espoused. The discovery
of his self-deception produced an exaggerated skepticism in his
later years, hence his rejection of the psychedelic experience
as &quot;pop Zen&quot; (in <I>The Ghost in the Machine</I>). Perhaps
It is not surprising that he also had a negative experience in
an experiment with psychedelic drugs. And as for skepticism, Jean-Paul
Sartre was a chronic skeptic if ever there was one, and he, too,
experienced only the negative aspects of psychedelics in his first
and only psychedelic experiment. The experiments of such as these
are essays in search of proof that nothing has been missed, they
do not start with a premise of openness and love of life for its
own sake, as Huxley has prescribed, but of exclusion and suspicion,
precisely the formula for torment.<P>
<CENTER>~~~~~~~~~~~~~</CENTER>
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
From the viewpoint revealed by these several (not altogether congruent)
paragraphs, it is not hard to see why the chronic skeptic, the
hardened reporter, William Braden, might not be able to shed his
defenses, and paradigm, to experience the age-old visionary reality.
He sees a cartoon-world which he takes for hard, cold &quot;reality,&quot;
the kind of world his underlying mythology has created, and yet
the visionary psychedelic wisdom unlocked by these chemicals does
not permit him to believe in his own paradigm. He &quot;knows&quot;
plenty about Eastern philosophy, about western science, about
anything you can name, but it is all theoretical knowledge, none
of it bonded to ultimate experience, and so his world is, in the
final analysis, artificial, not &quot;reality-based&quot; as he
is bound by his metaphysic to believe. Suddenly he <I>experiences</I>
that artificiality in full force, with all the implied consequences
and contradictions, and of course, it is too much to take. What
is surprising about bad trips is not that they occur, but that
they are not predominant. The power of these substances to forbid
the lie of an empty metaphysic, a hard, cold world of facts devoid
of ultimate mystery and spirituality, would seem to me to require
bad trips almost every time for us moderns. It is the obvious
near-indestructibility of the human spirit, the almost unbelievable
fact that man survives in this lunatic world still for the most
part unscathed, that explains much about the results of psychedelic
experience and why it is not usually or even uniformly a negative
experience. Thanks be to those such as Huxley for providing a
light in our darkness, so that at least a few of us may find our
way through.

<h4>CHAPTER ONE</h4>

<h3>A LOVIN' SPOONFUL</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<p> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the beginning, more exactly . . . in 1943,
Albert Hofmann, a Swiss bio-chemist working at the Sandoz
Pharmaceutical Laboratories in Basel, discovered &#151; by
accident, of course; one does not deliberately create such a
situation &#151; a new drug which had some very remarkable
effects on the human consciousness. The name of this drug was
d-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide Tartrate-25, a semi-synthetic
compound, the Iysergic acid portion of which is a natural product
of the ergot fungus <i>Claviceps purpurea</i>, which grows on rye
and other grains. Its most striking pharmacological
characteristic is its extreme potency &#151; it is effective at
doses of as little as ten-millionths of a gram, which makes it
5000 times more potent than mescaline. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was during the synthesis of d-LSD-25 that chance
intervened when Dr. Hofmann inhaled some of the whitish-brown
powder and discovered that it produced some strange effects on
his mind. . . . 'Objects, as well as the shape of my associates
in the laboratory, appeared to undergo optical change . . .
fantastic pictures of extraordinary plasticity and intensive
colour seemed to surge towards me.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> </p>

<h4>1960</h4>
<i>

<p>New York City</i>, seventeen years later . . . a small package
from Switzerland arrived in my mail one morning containing one
gram of Dr. Hofmann's acid, which I had arranged to be sent to
me. There was also a bill for $285. I had first heard of LSD from
Aldous Huxley, when I had telephoned him at his home in Los
Angeles to inquire about obtaining some mescaline, which he had
recently been using. His information also included the name of
Dr. Albert Hofmann and a caution, subsequently unheeded, to take
great care if ever I should take any of the stuff: 'It is much
more potent than mescaline, though Gerald (Heard) and I have used
it with some quite astonishing results really.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There had been no difficulty obtaining even one
gram of LSD &#151; I simply asked an English doctor friend of
mine to write the order on a sheet of New York hospital
letterhead saying that I needed this ergot-derivative as a
'control' drug for a series of bone-marrow experiments. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Eagerly I unwrapped the package. The acid was in a
small dark jar marked 'Lot Number H-00047', and in appearance
looked a bit like malted milk powder. My problem was how to
convert the loose powder into a more manageable form. One gram
would make 5000 individual doses and I was obviously going to
need to measure it out in some way. I decided to randomise it by
mixing it into a stiff paste made from icing sugar. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I cleared the kitchen table and set to work. First
I poured some distilled water into a bowl, and then mixed in the
LSD. When all the acid had dissolved I added confectioner's sugar
until the mixture was a thick paste. I then transferred my
'divine confection', spoon by laborious spoon, into a
sixteen-ounce mayonnaise jar, and, by what magical alchemic
process, the stuff measured exactly 5000 spoonfuls ! In other
words, one teaspoon of the stuff ought to contain 200 gamma
(millionths of a gram), which would be sufficient for an eight-
to ten-hour session, and a pretty intense one at that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I should add at this point that I had, like all
good chefs, been tasting the preparation during its making with
my finger, and must have absorbed about the equivalent of five
heavy doses before I finally screwed the lid on the mayonnaise
jar, which left me somewhat unprepared for what was to follow. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I rented at that time the floor-through apartment
above Jim Paul Eiler's 'Showplace' on West Fourth Street near the
corner of Macdougal and Washington Square. It was a large
rambling place -with a roof garden over the back from which to
observe the life of the Village and the concrete towers of
Manhattan. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I moved on to the roof and sat up there and began
to observe . . . <i>I beheld a city of 10,000 angry streets, and
giant buildings fingered the sky; from a thousand throats the
giant screams. A hundred trash-cans tumble lids and litters
across the sidewalks, a siren goes hooting past, and all is
CHAOS. My mind was in a state of confusion, of whirling
distractions and distortions and intensely vivid non sequiturs.
'I have broken the shell!' I laughed. 'Now I step forth easily
from my body's prison-cell and live in the realm of the
primordial. I shall sing of heroes, wild men of the mountains,
guardians of the door, and ancient legends.... I shall transform
myself into a god who could walk across the tops of mountains . .
. thousand-headed was Purusa, thousand-eyed, thousand-footed he
reached beyond the earth! . . . Cuhulain rides his five fiery
chariots across the firmament! Arthur and Lancelot in battle! The
ground shakes! In the beginning was blood and fire.... I shall
sing that you might listen and would know the glory that mall is,
now, in his first dawning.... In the beginning, then ... proudly
the purple cock-man proclaims the arrival of the Dawn. The Warden
of Robes enters to attend our abracadabra about Acid and All
accompanied by large assembly of Acid Age Adams, Artists,
Anarchists, Actors, Angels, Alchemists, Athletes, Aristocrats and
assorted Acrobats. The 'gates of heaven' swing open on the court
within; worshipping priests from 10,000 countries kneel before
the royal insignia. The first rays of the sun gild the 'fairy
palms'; smoke of incense swirls round dragons writhing on each
royal robe&#151;they seem to float among the clouds.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> It was a very strange first trip indeed, and it was of many
hours' duration, perhaps fifteen. What I had experienced was the
equivalent of death's abolition of the body. I had literally
'stepped forth' out of the shell of my body, into some other
strange land of unlikeliness, which can only be grasped in terms
of astonishment and mystery, as an <i>tat de l'absurde</i>,
ecstatic nirvana. I could now 'understand' why death could
produce the sort of confusionIwas experiencing. In life we are
anchored through the body to such inescapable cosmic facts as
space, gravity, electromagnetic vibrations and so forth. But when
the body is lost, the psychic factor which survives is free to
behave with uninhibited extravagance. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was only after many, many acid sessions that I
learned how to cope satisfactorily with the incessant barrage of
sense-eclipsing distractions, pleasant and unpleasant, delightful
and horrible, which acid induces. I discovered, for instance,
that I could, by concentrating my attention on some object, put a
stop to the whirling distractions. The object on which I
concentrated became a radiance of pure light, very wonderful
&#151; so wonderful that one could be wholly absorbed in it. It
would be possible to stop at this point, to convince oneself that
this was the Real Thing, the ultimate illumination, Nirvana! Or
the 'Divine White Light'! But &#151; let's face it &#151; LSD is
not the key to a new metaphysics of being or a politics of
ecstasy. The 'pure light' of an acid session is not this &#151;
it may even be the apotheosis of distractions, the ultimate and
most dangerous temptation. But it does allow one to live at least
for a time in the light of the knowledge that every moment of
time is a window into eternity, that the absolute is manifest in
every appearance and relationship, and that Love is Wisdom in
daily practice. And though hard, it is possible to live this way.
It is the development of another state of consciousness within
'one's' own self, one that leads to a vision of existence in
which only the sense of wonder remains and all fear is gone. It
is also the impetus that makes a few travellers in each
generation set off in search of the grail, the genii in the
bottle, the magic ring.... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> Once back in the present, when the 'mountains were again the
mountains, and the lakes again the lakes' I felt a degree of
apprehension about the acid I had by now stashed away in my
study. It was pretty volatile stuff. How on earth could the
energy of this strange atom be utilised; how could man adapt it
to his needs? LSD was a bundle of solutions looking for a
problem, the problem being how to undertake a work of integration
on a massive scale. Modern man had fallen victim to the merciless
vision of his own sceptical intelligence. Caught up in a
wilderness of externals, he was a stranger to himself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, I telephoned Aldous Huxley at his
home; he might at least advise me about what was happening with
regard to LSD. Huxley had used both mescaline and LSD and had
found in them, perhaps, the visions he had so long sought. On the
phone, he was very sympathetic. No, there was still no one in a
position to say what was happening in relation to visionary
experience via LSD, though it seemed to excite a great curiosity
in the minds of many he had discussed it with. Of course, there
was a lot of work to be done; unconsciously, if not always
consciously, everyone knows that this Other World is there,
inside the skull &#151; and any news about it, any discussion of
its significance, its relevance to other aspects of life, is a
matter of universal concern. Perhaps 'mindchangers' should be
used in the context of some kind of yoga of total awareness,
leading to enlightenment within the world of everyday experience
&#151; which of course under acid becomes the world of miracle
and beauty and sublime mystery when the experience is what it
always ought to be. This could not be achieved by acid alone but
is achieved, essentially, through constant awareness &#151;
conscious even of the unconscious, by means of the ordinary
processes of living. Perhaps acid is above all a therapy for the
wide spread sickness of insensitiveness and ignorance which
psychologists call Normality' or 'mental health'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Huxley called me back a few days later, having
thought over my problem, and suggested that I go to Harvard to
meet a Dr. Timothy Leary, a professor there, whom he'd met
earlier that year in Copenhagen, when he had presented a paper on
induced visionary experience before the Fourteenth International
Congress of Applied Psychology. Leary had also read a paper on
'How to Change Behaviour' describing the induction of visionary
mental states by psilocybin, the synthetic of the sacred mushroom
of Mexico. He spoke very warmly of Leary as a scientist but also
as a man, whom he described as 'a splendid fellow'. Leary had
also written three classic monographs on personality and
psychotherapy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'If there is any one single investigator in America
worth seeing,' Huxley assured me, 'it is Dr. Leary.' <br>

<h4>1961</h4>

<p>There had been quite a bit of free-floating acid around
Greenwich Village that winter, but mostly restricted to the
'beats' of the East Village and a few wealthy Manhattan cats to
whom they sold it. It was legal, of course, in those days, and
this considerably reduced the paranoia level. 'Taking acid' had
not yet become the popular pastime of a turned-on youth, for such
didn't exist. The world of the late fifties and early sixties was
unimaginably drab and dreary. It was still a tight little
conformist world of roles and rules and rituals. Our culture had
drowned itself in a sea of contradictory and conflicting voices.
And, politically, Dulles &amp; Co. had tied the coldwar noose
around all our throats. We had finally conned ourselves into
submission to some nameless fear. Western civilisation lived
under the paranoia of the mushroom cloud. Liberal and religious
values had eroded to the point of insignificance.
Twentieth-century mass-society showed the political inhumanity
inherent in technological life-worlds. And it was perhaps
inevitable that some of us took to acid (and later to myths and
ancient stories) to seek a formula that would turn the
surrounding world to dust and reveal the portals of paradise. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I think that for perhaps the majority of the
avant-garde. in this very early period, LSD was still something
of an 'exotic' whose effects could not be taken for granted. LSD
involved risk. It was anarchistic; it upset our apple-carts,
torpedoed our cherished illusions, sabotaged our beliefs. It was
something you had to guard against, or you might explode. It was
a difficult experience to assimilate. It was impossible to
integrate with the ordinary world. And so on and so forth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Turning on' had not yet become a natural part of
our existence, or a symbol of certain life-styles, or philosophy,
or religion, or personal liberation. Yet there were some, of my
circle, who, with Rimbaud, could say, 'I dreamed of crusades,
senseless voyages of discovery, republics without a history,
moral revolution, displacement of races and continents: I
believed in all the magics.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And our Crusade was to launch LSD on the world!
Whilst other artists/visionaries/seers had been content to
observe the world, the New Message was simple: if things are not
right, then change them! We would make the dynamic life-giving
adventure of exploring Inner Space the New Romance! We would set
off an explosion that would sweep through our culture and give
birth to a New Radicalism! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We would even found a drug-based religion, whose
message would be 'Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out'! We would proclaim
the Reign of the Happily Integrated Modern Soul ! We would become
the first signatories of a new 'Declaration of Evolution' as
published in Timothy Leary's <i>The Polities of Ecstasy</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After my first few acid sessions, I began to
undergo some kind of metamorphosis. None of the successive issues
in my life were plain, nothing was concrete; I was now that
helpless drifting man, cut off from his roots, with no
destination told. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The reality on which I had consciously tried to
build my personality had dissolved into Maya, the hallucinatory
facade. Stripped of one kind of reality, and unwilling or unable
to benefit from the possibilities of another one, I was acutely
aware of my helplessness, my utter transience between two worlds,
one inside and the other wholly within. It set up a dichotomy,
and I was at the mercy of two contradictory yet seemingly
inseparable attitudes. There was, on the one hand, still the
familiar world of ordinary appearances, which I could cope with
without ever needing to find any meaning for, and then there was
this 'Other World' whose existence alone seemed to disclose the
nature of reality as it concerned me personally. In the former I
was a stranger to myself, a puppet of rote-consciousness, a
cipher on the face of existence, an object furnished with a label
and a price-tag, numbed and numbered by a neutral time that is
neither duration nor eternity. In the latterIwas not a dot but a
species in the great evolutionary experiment, a conscious agent
in the cosmic processes called life; it provided me with some
'meaning' for solitary existence, beyond the falsifications of
the mind, where I hoped I could achieve a simple awareness and
even affirmation of the world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was faced with the necessity to prepare a set of
'spiritual coordinates'; a set of natural harmonious rules to
follow as I spun off into neurological space, and more effective
instruments of symbolisation in order to leave this swampland in
which I moved. I was lost and exhausted, ambushed by stagnation
and depression. Yet it was the energy created out of this
tension, verging on strain, that kept me going in New York for a
few more months. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was working in New York at that time as the
executive secretary of the Institute for British American
Cultural Exchange. This grandiose title meant that I was in the
service of a semi-official British propaganda agency in the field
of international cultural relations. There was an impressive
board of directors, which included Lord and Lady Natalie
Douglas-Hamilton, Huntington Hartford (the megamillionaire whom
Tom Wolfe has described as someone who had come amongst us in the
role of a 'Martin Luther for modern culture'), Lionel Trilling,
W. H. Auden, Congressman Seymour Halpern, General Frank Howley,
the Vice-President of New York University, Buell Gallagher,
President of City College, New York. <br>

<p> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My offices were in the Huntington Hartford building
in the East Fifties, which cost a million dollars to convert into
Nassau Paladian and housed, in addition to the Institute
Speedparks Inc., The American Handwriting Institute, <i>Show</i>
magazine, and downstairs, a private art gallery. It was a neat
little set-up, and I felt rather pleased that we had got it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of my time was spent selecting scholarship
candidates for a Junior Year programme at St. Andrews University
(Lord Douglas-Hamilton's brother, The Duke of Hamilton, was
Chancellor); and for short-term credit courses at Oxford and
Cambridge; some of my time was spent meeting and talking with
executives of the large Foundations like the Carnegie and the
Rockefeller Institute, to try to get more money for our
programmes. But most of the time I spent smoking grass; and,
towards the end, getting stoned on acid. And, as the summer of
1961 approached, it became increasingly clear that I should have
to resign. The programmes had got all their dates mixed up, and
nothing about accommodation had been firmed up; the files were in
a mess, and piles of unanswered correspondence littered my desk;
bills accumulated and income was reduced to almost nil. My hours
became erratic. I very seldom bothered to answer the phone. When
people came to see meIwould always be stoned and doubtless
altogether incoherent. I attacked the Queen. I spoke
disparagingly of British culture. I spoke of 'kingdoms yet to
come' with a sort of women's magazine glibness. And I kept having
visions of this 'Golden Dawning' of consciousness in man which
would enable us to get things whole, to see life's magic
miracles, to know that indeed all is in everything from blade of
grass to man and woman. It was a vision of some ideal existence
in which there was only the sense of wonder, and all fear gone;
of a certain state of being that was there not to be judged, but
simply to be. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> </p>

<h4>September 1961</h4>
<i>

<p>Cambridge, Massachusetts</i> . . . The New England Fall was
just beginning, and the leaves on the trees were changing colour;
the air was fresh and clear, like Vichy water, and Cambridge
seemed an altogether nice place to be. I didn't know anybody, so
I rented a couple of rooms in a house on Brattle Street, and
moved in. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My object in coming to Cambridge was to meet Dr.
Leary to discuss LSD, or more exactly, to seek his advice about
what I should do with the some 4975 trips I had left in the
mayonnaise jar. The next day I telephoned him at his office on
Divinity Avenue and arranged to meet him over lunch at the
Faculty Club. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the telephone Leary was very much the cautious
professional and I was a bit apprehensive.... Leary, the author
of <i>Interpersonal Diagnostic of Personality</i>; Leary, the
no-nonsense behaviourist; Leary, the number one American expert
in personality testing. And yet, according to Huxley, this was
the man who was doing important new research in the non-clinical
uses of the Sacred Mexican Mushroom. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At twelve o'clockIwalked along Mount Auburn Street,
flanked on one side by white colonial houses with pretty gardens,
and on the other by the river Charles. A university boat crew
lazed by the boathouse. On the banks tidy groups of students sat
rapping or reading. Across the river, sharply outlined in the
bright sunlight, I saw the Georgian features of the Harvard
Business School, and the busy Boston Freeway reminded me of
Robert Lowell's lines: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Everywhere <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; giant finned cars nose forward like fish; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; a savage servility <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; slides by on grease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon I was in Harvard Square, and it was not long
before I reached the Faculty Club, an impressive building just
across from the Library. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had arranged to meet Leary inside the main lobby,
near the cloakroom. But the place was jammed with intense,
garrulous, smooth-suited, young men, and, since I had no idea
what Leary looked like, I asked a porter at the reception desk
whether the professor had arrived. He pointed to a handsome,
clean-cut man in his late thirties wearing a Harris-tweed jacket
and grey flannels. He also had on a pair of torn sneakers and one
red-socked toe peeped out from one largish hole. He had the
conventional Harvard short-back-and-sides and a hearing-aid
visible on one exposed ear. He was reading the sports section of
the <i>Boston Globe</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Dr. Leary? How nice to meet you. I'm Michael
Hollingshead.' We shook hands, and he smiled broadly and beckoned
me to the dining-room door, seating us at a small table by the
wall, where we could talk without being disturbed. I asked him to
order for both of us. We small-talked during the meal. Leary
seemed a bit distracted with other thoughts, and sometimes would
fiddle with his hearing-aid, as though blaming the instrument for
his inability to catch what I was saying. So I said nothing, and
encouraged him to talk. He was a very funny raconteur and told
stories about his life in Berkeley and his family and his
sabbatical in Florence. It wasn't until the coffee came that he
got on to the subject of psychedelics. He began telling me about
his work with psilocybin, the mushroom drug. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed that the University had let him set up
something he called the Harvard Psychedelic Research Project for
the study of these drugs and to test their potential as aids to
facilitate behaviour change. He felt they had great potential use
in such areas as alcoholism, recidivism, even in juvenile
delinquency. He then elaborated his theory of the game-structure
of Western society; how we all play games, for which there are
definite roles, rules, and rituals. Sick or mentally deranged
persons were 'game-losers'. If the game was, say, football, then
a neurotic person would turn up wearing cricket gear and insist
that everyone play his game. Efficient game players were those
who could make definitions and from them decisions which
corresponded to the consensus reality. He told me that the
psilocybin experience helped people get out of all games, move
into a space he called 'non-game', from which Olympian height the
subject could see his own hang-ups. And it was this insight, he
felt, that would provide them with the necessary impetus to
change. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I said that I'd never taken psilocybin, but it
interested me and I'd like to try it, if that could be arranged.
I then told him a bit about my first acid experience, and how I
had been taking it on average about once a week since then, and
was now more baffled than when I started using it. I felt LSD was
probably more confusing than illuminating. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary said there was still a lot of work to be done
in the field. He had not himself yet taken LSD, but he imagined
its effects on the mind to be similar to those he had experienced
under psilocybin. The main problem was one of communication: how
to verbalise an essentially non-verbal experience in such a way
as to make sense to people living in the ordinary game-reality
who anyway thought of these drugs as mysterious rather than
mystical. Here we were talking of temporary alterations of the
human consciousness brought about by these extraordinary
substances &#151; which cause a by-passing of automatic
programming in human speech and action, making possible direct
awareness at higher-than-normal levels of intensity and in
other-than-utilitarian worlds of experience. These drugs, if
properly used, could be the source of energy that is to transform
the human mind. But for the majority of his behaviourist
colleagues, these drugs were a threat to their game. They tend to
hide their mediocrity behind 'scientific' models and mechanical
designs of the human organism which are by definition mediocre,
generating triviality and error. As a consequence, they veer
easily into paranoid fantasies about the subjective nature of the
psychedelic experience, probably thinking anyone using these
drugs is pretty crazy anyhow. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nevertheless, the situation at Harvard was pro the
Behaviourists &#151; B. F. Skinner, the American Pavlov, was
getting massive appropriations from the Federal Government for
programmed teaching machines and research into conditioned and
re-conditioned human behaviour, and for whom the term 'mind' was
about as meaningless as the word 'snow' to someone living in the
middle of Africa. Mind, if it existed, was an aberration of the
computer's 'mind'; man was a conditioned animal, imprinted from
birth for life in ordered, concrete society. His brain was a
problem-solving mechanism, either efficient or inefficient.
Skinner and his boys were engaged in nothing less than a massive
programme of human conditioning, starting at primary school
level. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Skinner's philosophy stood in direct contrast to
Leary's. Rather than thinking of mind in man as some kind of
spanner in the works, the psychedelic-user is more likely to see
it as a truly miraculous instrument for new perceptions and
insights about those aspects of reality which concern him
personally. He may feel awed by the sudden power it releases
during a session and realise that his mind is his greatest
endowment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary had little time for those scientists who
extended the machine paradigm to living organisms. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Qualitative change is needed in the pattern of
    mind-research if we are to discern an enlarged meaning of
    nature and of man extending beyond mathematical and
    experimental analysis of sensory phenomena and human
    behaviour. The new direction of research has been to hasten
    the technicalisation of human nature and ignore as a
    superstition all work on those aspects of human nature which
    do not conform with the orthodoxy of the body-machine
    concept. We must move beyond this sort of scientific tyranny
    of behaviouristic and mechanistic procedures, where man is
    understood in terms of controls or biological-drive
    mechanisms. This is carrying Descartes too far. A psychedelic
    user cannot reduce the mind-brain problem to a materialistic
    monism. He is more likely to see how the current
    over-emphasis on mechanism has produced a corresponding
    dislocation of vision, one that is resulting in a
    de-humanisation of man. He is more likely to turn into a
    revolutionary than a college professor.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was getting late. Leary had a class at three
o'clock. I wondered how best to approach the fact that I had some
LSD with me. I decided to leave the matter for another day. We
shook hands and I said I'd call him again in a few days' time,
for another meeting. Fine. Perfect. We parted feeling it had been
a good lunch. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A couple of days passed, one of them tripping
around the museums and the banks of the Charles. The students
seemed strangely distant, and, in an odd sort of way,
English-looking, probably as a result of wearing tweedy clothes
and baggy grey trousers. Perhaps these are the robots Skinner has
conditioned, I thought, their minds sanctioned by scientific
objective reality as information-storing, predicting and
computing mechanisms, a 'tool' with which to shape a better
life-style in the great American dream. They seemed unaware that
there exists a range of energies and awarenesses beyond
rote-consciousness or the imprinted symbols of rational thought
which can work with a rapidity and efficiency beyond the workaday
conceptual processes. For every moment of human life is affected
by the way man's mind works. Everything we see, touch, think and
feel is linked with it, so that when the mind is extended for
brief moments, as it is under acid, these elements can be used
more freely and creatively, and can therefore be a tremendously
important influence in a person's life.... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My need to communicate this was very great indeed.
But the few people I did talk to about LSD seemed blithely
indifferent, or even a little shocked. I felt like some sleazy
drug operator in Marseilles, trying to hook young kids on heroin.
I began to get depressed, feeling that I'd got life cocked or
somehow incomplete after fooling about with all this acid. By the
end of my third day in Cambridge, I was feeling suicidal. A
communication problem, Leary had said. Okay, then, I'd try to
communicate with him, perhaps he would be able to emphathise with
my plight. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I got him at the office the next day. I had already
mailed him a short note the night before alerting him to my
inability to cope with my life-situation due to the disruptive
influence of acid. And when he got on the phone he spoke calmly
and authoritatively about how we must all share our knowledge
about these drugs, and how I had a lot to contribute, and that a
George Litwin would drive round to pick me up at my digs and
bring me back to the office. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; George turned up some ten minutes after putting the
receiver down. He was a genial and open Leo with lots of energy
forever rising. On the way to the office, he told me that he was
a graduate student in psychology, and Leary was his thesis
adviser. He'd taken psilocybin a few times, and had even taken
mescaline at the University of Chicago where he went to school.
Now he was a behaviourist who believed in psychedelic drugs,
which he felt was a bit heretical of him to say the least. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon we pulled up outside a pretty colonial style
house marked 'Social Relations Department: Center for Research in
Personality', which I later discovered was the same building in
which William James had done his researches with nitrous oxide
(laughing gas) until he was told to stop. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; George lead me along a corridor to Leary's office.
Leary was seated behind a desk dictating something to his Chinese
secretary, who kept giggling every time someone came through the
door. A few young men sat on a sofa quietly reading from piles of
mimeographed papers. One wall was entirely covered with a huge
blackboard on which the day's timetable was noted. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary waved me to a chair next to the desk,
finished whatever he was dictating, and screwed in the ear-aid in
an obvious attempt to let me know he was listening with all ears.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I repeated some of my thoughts explaining how my
personal philosophy had changed since LSD. I needed a place where
I could simply be, without always having to justify what I was
into. I also explained that I was broke and needed a place to
crash. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He invited me to move in to his house in the Newton
Center suburb of Boston. He said that I could use the attic,
which was large and spacious, where I would not be disturbed. He
gave me a $20 bill and asked George to take me over there. Once I
was more settled, I could join his team working with psilocybin.
Would I like to teach a course one hour a week to a class of
graduate students &#151; a course in existential philosophy,
concentrating on the phenomenological aspects of heightened
states of consciousness ? Would I like to borrow his Volkswagen
to drive to New York and pick up the rest of my things? Would
dinner at eight suit me? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He could not have been more helpful. I began to
realise what Huxley had meant when he called Leary 'a splendid
fellow'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Apart from Tim and myself, the only other people
living in the house were his two children, Jackie and Susan.
There were the occasional girl-friends, and visitors up for the
weekend from New York. But usually the house was quiet and its
life simple. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a big house with a beautiful garden and
sited next to the Little League Baseball ground, where Tim,
Jackie and myself would often join one of the evening games with
the local kids. The rest of the evening might be spent in telling
each other amusing stories, discussing the implications of
psychedelics, baseball or travel. Tim was also a great fan of D.
H. Lawrence, and we would chat about Lawrence's life and his
'message'. Every now and then I'd bring up the matter of the
mayonnaise jar, but Tim didn't seem particularly interested in
trying LSD, probably because he didn't want to get other issues
in the way of his on-going (and officially sanctioned) 'mushroom
research', as it was referred to in those days. His view might be
summarised as saying: When you've had one psychedelic, you've had
them all. But he did give me some psilocybin to try, which came
in the form of tiny red pills from Sandoz. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I dropped three of these pills, which was
considered about optimal dosage, for my first trip. I was alone
in the house. And I felt good about taking a session, especially
as I was very curious to see how the experience would compare
with acid. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The effect was excellent, though not as powerful as
LSD. It contained lots of magic and induced all kinds of very
pleasant visual changes, with colours deepening, turning the
house and garden into a Persian miniature of exquisite beauty and
prettiness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was a little disappointed when, after four hours,
the landscape changed back into twentieth-century American
reality. But I enjoyed it and used to take it pretty regularly
after that. Perhaps after all, LSD was too powerful for our
fragile nervous systems to bear? Besides, the effects of
psilocybin were of only four hours' duration, compared to
anything up to twelve hours on high-dosage acid. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> I had been living at Tim's for about a couple of weeks when
Maynard Fergusson, the Canadian trumpet player, arrived with his
wife, Flo. They were old close friends of Tim, and to us seemed
the ultimate manifestations of the current New York 'in' crowd
they were witty, urbane, hip, and cool in all areas. They also
enjoyed smoking pot. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was in those days no popular voice speaking
for marijuana, although it was considered by the 'in' crowd to be
the last word in status symbols. It was also illegal, a fact that
made Tim feel a bit paranoid about people smoking it in his
house. He did not use it himself. He took nothing stronger than a
few micrograms of psilocybin. And of course wine and whisky,
which he believed were 'indispensable luxuries'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One evening the subject turned to LSD. They
discussed acid in terms of a fluent flow of neologisms, jazz
slang, and weird verbal formulations. They treated the subject
lightly, as they also would marijuana and getting stoned in
general. And it became apparent to me that they had never
actually tried it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Later, when they heard that I had some, they
suggested that we all have an acid session together, including
Tim. Tim excused himself, saying he had some papers to mark. But
said we were welcome to take it if we wished. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I brought down the mayonnaise jar and gave Maynard
and Flo a teaspoonful of the confection. I also took one myself.
We then settled comfortably around the blazing log fire, lit some
candles and incense, and prepared for take-off. Tim had been
fussing about in the room while all this had been going on,
trying not to let his curiosity take him away from whatever other
business he was engaged in. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After about thirty minutes, Flo, who until that
moment had been lying fully reclined on the sofa, sat up,
suddenly, her face one huge smile, and started waving her arms at
Tim. 'You gotta try this, Tim, baby. It's f-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c!' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Yeah, really, Tim,' confirmed Maynard, his face
glowing like an electric toaster. 'It really gets you there
&#151; wow &#151; it's really happening, man.... ' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps Tim was impressed by the evidence of his
two friends, who were after all pretty hip and experienced in
using drugs. Perhaps he saw that we were all having a great time,
and he wanted in. Whatever it was, something finally decided him
and he took a spoon of the acid. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What happened to him next was the subject of a
chapter in his book, <i>High Priest</i>, which he published
several years later. As Tim described it in his book: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'It has been five years since that first LSD trip with
    Michael Hollingshead. I have never forgotten it. Nor has it
    been possible for me to return to the life I had been leading
    before the session. I have never recovered from the
    shattering ontological confrontation. I have never been able
    to take myself, my mind, and the social world around me
    seriously. Since that time five years ago I have been acutely
    aware of the fact that I perceive everything within the
    around me as a creation of my own consciousness. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; From that day . . . I have never lost the
    realisation that I am an actor and that everything around me
    is a stage prop and setting for the comic drama I am creating
    . . . LSD can be a profoundly asocial experience. Since that
    first trip with Michael I was never able to commit myself to
    the game of proselytising for LSD itself. Nothing that
    doesn't ring true to my ancient cell wisdom and to that
    central vibrating beam within can hold my attention for very
    long. From the date of this session it was inevitable that we
    would leave Harvard, that we would leave American society and
    that we would spend the rest of our lives as mutants,
    faithfully following the instructions of our internal
    blueprints and tenderly, gently disregarding the parochial
    social inanities.' </p>

<h4>CHAPTER TWO</h4>

<h3>THE HARVARD HAPPENINGS</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<h4>1961</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At Harvard University in the early sixties,
students had not yet discovered pot; the great majority were into
booze, and there was considerable emphasis on physical prowess
and middle-class, American WASP values. They had not escaped from
the prison of their conditioning and the grand diagonal of crisis
in student sensibilities was between those who went to football
games and those who didn't. There was also a snob element, the
Ivy League ethos, which pervaded the campus. Harvard was a sort
of club designated by the <i>imprimatur</i> of the establishment.
Yet 1961 was to herald a change of consciousness that was to have
a seismic effect not only on the sensibilities of many Harvard
students but on all sections of American culture. I refer of
course to the advent of psychedelic drugs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary had returned from a holiday in Mexico where
he had first taken the Sacred Mushroom called teonancatl or
'flesh of the gods' which had been used as a kind of sacrament in
Aztec religious rites, with a history going back more than 2000
years. The botanical name for this narcotic mushroom is <i>Psilocybe
mexicana</i>, which has autonomic side-effects similar to those
of LSD, though milder. According to the Harvard ethnobotanist,
Dr. Richard Schultes, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>' . . . psychedelic plants act on the central nervous
    system to bring about a dream-like state marked by extreme
    alterations in consciousness of self, in the understanding of
    reality, in the sphere of experience, and usually marked
    changes in perception of time and space; they almost
    invariably induce a series of visual hallucinations, often in
    kaleidoscopic movement, usually in rather indescribably
    brilliant and rich and unearthly colour, frequently
    accompanied by auditory and other hallucinations and
    varieties of synesthesias.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Psilocybe mexicana</i> mushroom was
synthesised by Dr. Albert Hofmann in 1958 at the Sandoz
Laboratories and given the trade name <i>Psilocybin</i>. It was
one of a range of psychedelic (mind-manifesting, mind-opening)
plants which dramatically alter psychological functions such as
mood, sensation, perception, consciousness, and cognitive
function, which are described as 'mystico-revelatory' by various
investigators, but statements about the subjective effects and
clinical differences among these substances are, at this stage of
our knowledge, in the realm of folklore. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is considerable disagreement in the
literature as to the interpretation of the effects of
psychedelics, but there is substantial, one might say unanimous,
accord on one major point: they do drastically alter human
consciousness. They apparently knock out inhibitory processes in
the nervous system (which select, discriminate, censor, evaluate)
and they thus release an enormous flow of previously screened-out
awareness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The words which one uses to describe the
psychedelic experience depend upon the investigator's cultural
background, his language repertoire, his literary breadth. If you
usually label 'psychotic' anything which lies outside the
middle-class cultural ego of your tribe, you will call these
psychedelic experiences pathological. If you define 'maturity' in
terms of those modes of perception popular in urban America of
1961, then you may call any experience outside these limits as
'regressive'. It was Leary's thesis that the psychedelic effect
is a <i>transcendental experience, accompanied by intense
positive or negative psychological reactions</i>. There is
transcendence of space-time categories, of the ego, of
subject-object worlds of experience, of words. There is usually a
sense of unity or 'oneness' with internal and external process
which can be ecstatic and exalting, but which can also be
frightening to the unprepared person in a strange or
non-supportive physical setting. Whilst most psychologists tend
to emphasise the pathological reactions; most subjects, who do
not think in pathological categories, stress the positive aspects
of the drug experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This would suggest that specificity of reaction to
a psychedelic drug is primarily a function of set and setting. If
the mental set of the subject and the physical setting or
environment are positive, supportive, anxiety-free, then the
reaction of the subject will be ecstatic, insightful, and
educational. If the set and setting are clinical, experimental,
non-supportive, and impersonal, then the reactions will be
frightening and confusing. Take the case of the American Indians
who still use peyote in connection with their religion. The
peyote rite is one of prayer and quiet contemplation. Their
doctrine consists of belief in God, brotherly love, care of
family and other worthy beliefs. Peyote is conceived of as a
sacrament, a holy god-given food and an available means of
communion with the Spirit of the Almighty. When ingested, it
causes the worshipper to experience a vivid revelation in which
he 'sees' or 'hears' the spirit of a departed loved one, or
experiences other religious phenomena; or he may be shown the way
to solve some daily problem, and experience a deep reverential
attitude to the divine; sometimes he may be reproved for some
evil thought or deed. For the Indian, there is nothing debasing
or morally reprehensible about using a psychedelic substance to
establish contact with the gods, for he believes the peyote
cactus to be of divine origin. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the modern-day Westerner, the psychedelic
experience can be very unexpected, seeing how personality is the
product of conscious and unconscious imprinting as it may also be
seen as the subjective expression of the society in which we
happen to be brought up. We like to believe in the general
regularity of our mental life, in the constancy of our views or
opinions, and like to think how much we are alike, our so-called
normality. But in the psychedelic state, our mind seems to obey
no rules and, except in trivial ways, seems to exist outside the
scope of ordinary rational consciousness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not surprising, therefore, that psychedelic
drugs like LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and peyote were considered
by the American psychological establishment as <i>psychotomimetic</i>
agents, and in the literature we note that researchers use the
language of psychopathology to describe mystical and ecstatic
experiences, in what Leary calls 'catalogues of anguish and
conflict'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychiatric researcher is trained to see the
world through negative, pathological lenses. He is myopic and
cannot see the wood for the trees. When he observes mystical or
transcendental or ecstatic reactions the psychiatrist falls back
on the concepts to which he is committed. He uses the language of
pathology. Psychedelic drugs produce reactions which are not
conventional. Somebody else's ecstasy always looks rather bizarre
or foolish or insane to such an observer. Since ecstatic
behaviours are not conventional and 'normal' it follows that they
must be abnormal. Psychotic. Crazy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A typical psychiatric interpretation reads like
this: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'This paper describes our initial pilot study of clinical
    effects of psilocybin. The volunteers selected were told only
    that they might receive a substance which would produce
    temporary changes in perception and bodily feelings or an
    inert substances A baseline EEG, mental status and checklist
    of symptoms was completed before the drug was administered. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Notice the suggestive use of a 'list of symptoms';
a researcher not oriented towards pathology could have checked
the subject out on a list of ecstasies and illuminating
experiences.) </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The experiment was conducted in a dark room. A nurse or
    doctor or both were constantly in attendance. Every fifteen
    minutes the psychiatrist rated the subject's responses on the
    checklist and conducted a mental status examination.
    Volunteers were told that they might be required to remain in
    the hospital for twenty-four hours, but only in two instances
    (out of fourteen) was this necessary. Results visual
    hallucinations, illusions, a form of hyperacusis, body image
    distortions, euphoria, anxiety, depression, blocking,
    disorganised thinking, distractibility, flight of ideas,
    clang associations, inability to abstract. A subject in
    response to the proverb &quot;People in glass houses
    shouldn't throw stones'' said before the drug, &quot;You
    shouldn't point out faults in others that might exist in
    yourself&quot;. After the drug he said, 'At who? That depends
    on a lot of things.&quot; Autonomic responses, pupillary
    dilation, nausea, dizziness, flushing, abdominal complaints,
    blood pressure and pulse.... Usage of these drugs especially
    in an out-patient setting is fraught with the danger and
    should be undertaken only with the greatest caution.
    Psilocybin, LSD and mescaline are extremely potent agents
    capable of producing acute psychotic behaviour in many
    individuals. Depression with the ever-present risk of suicide
    may develop during or after their administration. Additional
    post-drug effects also occur. Once a patient has been
    entrusted with a hallucinogen even when instructed to take
    the drug in small doses, below the hallucinogenic threshold,
    we have no control over the number of pills he may take. The
    use of hallucinogens should be restricted to research in a
    hospital setting.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The genius of Leary was that he avoided the
behaviourist approach to the study and use of psychedelics. Avoid
labelling, depersonalising the subject. Don't impose your own
scientific jargon or your own experimental game models. Do not
set out to validate the redundant implications of your own
premises. Do not limit yourself to the pathological hypotheses.
Do not interpret ecstasy as mania; calm serenity as catatonia; we
must not diagnose Buddha as a detached schizoid; nor Christ as an
exhibitionist and/or masochist; nor the mystic experience as a
symptom; nor the visionary state as a model psychosis. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Right from the start the Harvard Psychedelic
Project was surrounded by a charged field of excitement, glamour,
adventure, enthusiasm, mystery, hyperbole, passion, controversy.
Those who were running the show were charismatic, distinguished,
articulate and colourful. Whilst the majority of the Harvard
faculty was content to observe the world, our message was
revolutionary: if things are not right, then let's change them.
LSD et as was the New Heresy that gave birth to momentous social
change in the form of a New Radicalism, which had as its core the
experience of transcendence. Man could take a 'third eye' view of
himself. He could escape from the prison of his conditioning, his
robot-self, and move towards wholeness, completeness,
place-in-the-world. We could all be conscious agents in the
evolutionary process. This was to be our brave Golden Age of
Anarchy when man would free himself from the dehumanisation of
self-perpetuating, oligarchical bureaucracies and build a new,
socialised, humanized super-society. We wanted to make
'turning-on' a natural part of modern man's existence, for the
experience of liberation from the tyranny of the ego is an
experience so extraordinary, so unique, that it is never
forgotten by the individual&#151;indeed, the vision is the
impetus to behaviour change. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our offices at that time were located in an old,
remodelled Cambridge house&#151;Five Divinity Avenue. About nine
faculty members and seventy graduate students in psychology used
the building as their place of research and study, and it was a
division of the Social Relations Department. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As fate or chance would have it, the building was
called Morton Prince House after one of the first American
psychologists to recognise alterations in consciousness as a
critical area for research. Morton Prince would still be
considered 'far out' today with his curious and bold interests in
multiple personality, hypnosis, trance states and visionary
experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed somehow most natural and proper that we
should be initiating a research into altered states of
consciousness in this building. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although Morton Prince was the founder of the
Center he was not the first Harvard scholar to adventure boldly
into the uncharted realms of inner space. The lineage of this
research can be traced to the turn of the century, to that most
venerable and greatest of American psychologists, William James,
who saw that if the riddle of consciousness was to be solved then
the researcher must use psychophysical means on himself. James
tried the peyotl cactus, the sacramental food of the
Indians&#151;only to be daunted by the stumbling block of nausea.
He also tried nitrous oxide (laughing gas) as an available means
of enlarging consciousness, and refers to his experiences in his
classic work, <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Some years ago I myself made some observations on this
    aspect of nitrous oxide intoxication, and reported them in
    print. One conclusion was forced upon my mind at that time,
    and my impression of its truth has ever since remained
    unshaken. It is that our normal waking consciousness,
    rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type
    of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the
    filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of
    consciousness entirely different. We may go through life
    without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite
    stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their
    completeness, definite types of mentality which probably
    somewhere have their field of application and adaptation. No
    account of the universe in its totality can be final which
    leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded.
    How to regard them is the question&#151;for they are so
    discontinuous with ordinary consciousness. Yet they may
    determine attitudes though they fail to give a map. At any
    rate, they forbid a premature closing of our accounts with
    reality. Looking back on my own experiences, they all
    converge towards a kind of insight to which I cannot help
    ascribing some metaphysical significance. The keynote of it
    is invariably a reconciliation. It is as if the opposites of
    the world whose contradictoriness and conflict make all our
    difficulties and troubles, were melted into unity. Not only
    do they as contrasted species, belong to one and the same
    genus, but <i>one of the species</i> the nobler and better
    one, <i>is itself the genus and so soaks up and absorbs its
    opposite into itself.</i> This is a dark saying, I know, when
    thus expressed in terms of common logic, but I cannot wholly
    escape from its authority. I feel as if it must mean
    something, something like what the Hegelian philosophy means,
    if one could only lay hold of it more clearly. Those who have
    ears to hear, let them hear; to me the living sense of its
    reality only comes in the artificial mystic state of mind.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So the genealogical line of research in altered
consciousness at Harvard starts with William James and from him
to Morton Prince. And after Prince came another giant of
psychology: Henry A. Murray, who was the director of the Center. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Professor Murray used fantasy, dream legend,
folklore, mystic vision, poetry and esoteric writings as the raw
material of his work on human personality. It was perhaps
inevitable that he would request a psychedelic session, and in
the spring of 1961 he took the drug for the first time. As he
said of his decision afterwards, 'Curiosity and the envisaged
possibility that I might revel in a little efficacious lunacy
spurred me on to it. Why not?' It was a bold decision for a
modern behavioural scientist at a time when the behaviourists
were the tough-minded guys who wanted to apply impeccable
scientific methodology to the study of the human organism, hiding
their mediocrity and lack of imagination behind 'scientific'
models, techniques, and mechanical 'designs' of the mind which
are by definition mediocre and unimaginative, generating
triviality and error. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Professor Murray realised that modern man is
sitting on top of a simmering volcano. The psychedelic experience
is one possible solution to avoid the deepening chaos; but
thinkers, philosophers, psychologists and scholars have been
singularly reticent about the possibility of expanding man's
awareness and as a group are disinclined to face up to the
existence of this new range of mind-changing chemicals by modern
synthetic chemistry. If the minds of men are blind, then surely
we should utilise whatever available means we have to restore
true vision. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychedelic experience and the insights it
provides entail the obligation to communicate and to listen.
Revelation and response are not a man's private affair; for the
revelation comes to one man for all men, and in his response he
is representative of mankind. And since the response is
representative it endows the recipient of revelation, in relation
to his fellow men, with the authority of the prophet. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here we come to the central problem. Spiritual
fervour is not necessarily accompanied by tact; and men at large
do not willingly recognise a new voice of authority when they
hear it. ( <i>Vide</i> Leary, Aldous Huxley, Herald Hear, Alan
Watts, Robert Graves, Henry Murray). The difficulties are
infinitely aggravated in our present-day world of easy mass
communication which encourages a multiplicity of successive and
often parallel authorities whose rival claims extend all over the
place by virtue of the large followership which they have found.
I think if a Jesus or a Buddha were to appear in our midst today
he would be hard pressed to convince anyone of the relevance to
mankind of his teachings. We find ourselves in a situation that
Aldous Huxley, the patron saint of the psychedelic movement,
touches on in his essay 'Art and the Obvious', where he talks of
the incompetence and vulgarity with which the great obvious
truths have been trivialised by hacks, and goes on to say that
'on some of the most sensitive and self-conscious artists of our
age, this state of affairs has had a curious and unprecedented
effect. They have become afraid of the obviousness of things, the
great as well as the little.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But perhaps the communication of an old obvious
truth&#151;that the fullest kind of maturity has its core in the
experience of personal transcendence&#151;consists not so much in
looking for new things to do as in finding new and relevant ways
of doing the obvious things. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is evident that every scientific, ethical,
aesthetic and spiritual advance has been made by individuals who,
to some extent, broke out of the prison of their linguistic and
social conditioning. And when we consider the present situation
of the world, we see that advancing technology has rendered our
prevailing nationalistic and militaristic culture completely
obsolete, inappropriate and appallingly dangerous. Populations,
civilisations and their rulers are everywhere the prisoners of
this obsolete culture. They can't escape. Indeed, they have been
so thoroughly conditioned that, although on the intellectual
level they are aware of their danger, they do not, on the
subconscious levels really want to escape. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What can be done to help individuals to become the
beneficiaries of language and culture without, at the same time,
becoming their prisoners and passive victims, or running amok
under the intoxicating influence of misused words? There are
several 'obvious' things that might be done.- We can give young
people (and adults) instruction in the nature, limitations and
capabilities for evil as well as for good, of language. We can
drum into their heads (as every wise man from Buddha and Saint
Paul down to those of the present has always done) that words are
not the same as things, that concepts are not experiences, that
pigeon-holes do not exist in nature, that it is both stupid and
unjust to hang a dog because somebody has given him a bad name
(Hitler massacred six million Jews who were regarded not as human
beings, but as the embodiment of a bad name). We must teach our
youth to take their ease with words, naively, by reflex. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These thoughts are pretty 'obvious' to those who
use psychedelics. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>(Huxley: Private correspondence.) 'The accelerating rate
    of technological advance, of preparation for war, and of
    population increase leaves the human race very little time in
    which to get out of the prevailing mess. Perhaps within a
    decade the difficulties created by increasing pressure of
    numbers upon resources and by the disruptive impact of
    technology upon established behaviour patterns, may easily
    involve the whole world in a deepening chaos, to which the
    only antidote will be the iron dictatorship of generals or
    commissars. Those of us who worked with psychedelic drugs
    believed that within this short period we must try to train
    up a sufficient and effective minority of individuals,
    capable of profiting by language and culture without being
    stultified or made mad by them, capable of changing obsolete
    behaviour patterns in such a way that mankind may find it
    possible to live in conformity, not with disastrous slogans
    and dogmas inherited from the past, but with the life
    process, the essential Suchness of the world.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My own view is that LSD may be nothing more than
the extreme lengths to which a handful of individuals were
prepared to go in order to ensure the continuity of their
necessary freedoms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This slight digression over, let us return to the
activities at Five Divinity Avenue, to that tiny group led by
Leary and sustained by Murray, who were to fiddle with
irrelevancies while the giant powers multiplied their infernal
weapons, threats, and provocations. As soon as it became known
that a research project involving the use of these new
psychedelic drugs was to be organised, large numbers of graduate
students came round to join the project. There were many planning
sessions, and an air of excitement pervaded Morton Prince House.
We also examined the available literature on the subject,
including the works of Aldous Huxley&#151;<i>Heaven and Hell</i>
and <i>The Doors of Perception</i> which detailed his experiences
with mescaline, as well as his novel <i>Island</i> about a
'positive Utopia' in which psychedelic drugs are used by a
community to help expand awareness and bring its members closer
to God. It was Huxley's solution to the problems and horrors he
described so dramatically in <i>Brave New World</i> and <i>Ape
and Essence</i>. There were also Leary's papers on the subject as
well as monographs by Frank Barron, a leading American authority
of creativity, Richard Alpert, a member of the Harvard Faculty,
and William Burroughs. It was not much, but it was enough to
start planning sessions based on non-clinical methodologies. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My job at this time was as an assistant to Leary. I
was living in his house and we would drive to the office each
morning from Boston, just across the river from Cambridge. I was
also given a course to teach, two hours a week, when I would meet
with perhaps a dozen graduate students in psychology to plan and
discuss LSD sessions. We would sit around discussing how best to
run group sessions, the function of the 'guide' or administrator,
and the ethical and interpersonal principles involved. The
atmosphere of the Center hadn't been this stirred since Harry
Murray was trying to solve the Lindberg kidnapping, since Morton
Prince tried to get in touch with the co-conscious 'spirit
world', since William James started a rage of nitrous oxide
parties in Boston's Back Bay. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What we wanted to achieve was an 'open',
collaborative and humanistic response to our research in order to
produce optimally positive reactions to the drug experience. And
by 'positive reaction' we meant a pleasant, ecstatic, non-anxious
experience leading to a broadening of awareness and an increase
in individual insight. The following principles were laid down by
the team: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Participants whenever possible will alternate
roles of observer and subject. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Participants will be given all available
information about the drug and its effects before the experiment.
We will attempt to avoid an atmosphere of mystery and secret
experimentation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. The participants will be given control of their
own dosage. A maximum dosage will be determined by the principal
investigators. This maximum number of tablets will be given the
subject and he will be told to dose himself at the rate and
amount he desires. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. The sessions will take place in pleasant,
spacious aesthetic surroundings. Music, art reproductions,
sympathetic observers will be available. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. The subject will be allowed to bring a relative
or friend to be his observer. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. No subject should take the drug in a group where
he is a stranger. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 7. An attempt will be made to have one observer for
each two subjects. The subjects will be given complete freedom of
the house but cannot leave the premises. Observers will be
available at all times for discussion. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 8. Observers will be present at the end of the
session for follow-up discussions. </p>

<p> It is interesting to look back at some of the original
members of the Harvard Psychedelic Project, who were first
introduced to LSD via the contents of the magic mayonnaise jar,
and to note their successive and deepening involvement in the
psychedelic movement, which was to spread from Harvard to all
sections of our Western culture as well as introduce a new
vocabulary for a turned-on youth movement ('psychedelic', 'acid',
'trip', 'stoned'); new slogans ('turn on, tune in, drop out');
new artistic forms (psychedelic art, acid rock, psychedelic
discotheques, a Beatle album openly celebrating the psychedelic
experience); new drug-associated organizations (The International
Federation for Internal Freedom [IFIF] in Cambridge, The Agora
Scientific Trust in New York, The World Psychedelic Centre in
London, The Castalia Foundation at Millbrook); new religions (The
Neo-American Church, The League for Spiritual Discovery, The Free
High Church of Cumbrae [Scotland], The Church of the Awakening,
San Francisco); new life-styles (head shops, ashrams, communes,
The Brotherhood of Eternal Love); an underground newspaper
service; new literary forms and themes <i>(High Priest, Time
Psychedelic Review, The Ecstatic Adventure, The Psychedelic
Experience, Psychedelic Prayers, The Varieties of Psychedelic
Experience)</i> and so on and so forth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Along the crowded corridors of the Center walked
Aldous and Laura Huxley, Arthur Koestler, William Burroughs,
Charles Olson, Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky, famous
musicians and painters, ministers, cured dope addicts, New York
hipsters, oriental religious leaders, rabbis and even a couple of
Jesuits. 'There is some possibility that my friends and I have
illuminated more people than anyone else in history.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not long before the Harvard Research Project
had grown to include some forty professors and graduate students,
who had sensed in the psychedelic experience a new tool with
which to shape and extend their awareness of the world and the
other people in it. And their claims on behalf of LSD et al were
highly articulate, and perhaps tinged with a fervour usually
associated with religious belief. Naturally, this had a
disturbing effect on their colleagues, who were doing <i>real</i>
psychology&#151;Delay of Gratification Experiments; Need for
Achievement; Personality Studies of Lower-Class Irish in South
Boston; The Rorschach Test; Need for Approval; Perception and
Motivation Studies. Psychology was the science of rats and tests
and statistics. Exploring and mapping new realms of internal
experience didn't belong here. Or did it ? Who could now really
say ? The hermetic vase had been opened, and the <i>avis Hermetis</i>
had flown the nest. The dynamic life-giving adventure of
exploring <i>inner space</i> was to become the <i>new romance</i>.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was inevitable that, as our drug programme
expanded, criticism and rumour began to flourish about our
activities. One of the most vocal of the critics was Professor
David McClelland, a professor of psychology, a protestant-ethic
man, highly intelligent, an expert in the psychological basis of
'fantasy', a prominent Quaker, dedicated to external achievement.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; McClelland had decided to bring matters to a head
by calling a meeting of the staff of the Center in which he
revealed in no uncertain terms his growing concern over the
Psychedelic Project. To judge by the behaviour of Mexican <i>curanderas</i>
and Indian mystics, he said, one would expect the chief effects
of psychedelic substances to be to encourage withdrawal from
contact with social reality and to increase satisfaction with
one's own inner thought life. Research reports from the current
Harvard project, he said, 'are not inconsistent with these
expectations'. And went on to note that 'initiates begin to show
a certain blandness, or superiority, or feeling of being above
and beyond the normal worlds of social reality'. He was concerned
about a developing interpersonal insensitivity, about the
'inability to predict in advance what the social reaction of a
&quot;psilocybin party&quot; would be'. And religious and
philosophical naivet: 'Many reports are given of deep mystical
experiences, but their chief characteristic is the wonder at
one's own profundity rather than a genuine concern to probe
deeper into the experience of the human race in these matters',
and impulsivity: 'One of the most difficult parts of the research
has been to introduce any order into who takes the drug under
what conditions. Any controls have either been rejected as
interfering with the warmth necessary to have a valuable
experience or accepted as desirable but then not applied because
somehow an occasion arises when it seems &quot;right&quot; to
have a psychedelic session'. He concluded his statements with
this warning: 'It is probably no accident that the society which
most consistently encouraged the use of these substances India,
produced one of the sickest social orders ever created by mankind
in which thinking men spent their time lost in the Buddha
position under the influence of drugs exploring consciousness,
while poverty, disease, social discrimination, and superstition
reached their highest and most organised form in all history.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another critic, Dr. Herbert Kelman, lecturer in
Social Psychology, said at a later meeting that he had observed
that graduate students in the project had formed clannish
'insider groups'. 'I also question whether this project is
carried out primarily as an intellectual endeavour or whether it
is being pursued as a new kind of experience to offer an answer
to man's ills,' he said. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The problem was one of communication, or rather the
lack of any, for we had let the rumours go unchecked. From the
point of view of those of us working on the project, psychedelic
drugs had an amazing potential, not only as aids to psychotherapy
but in such areas as prisoner rehabilitation, personal growth and
individual freedom, interpersonal community structures, improved
human relations, creativity, art and entertainment, education,
religion and philosophy, politics and sociology, experimental
behavioural science, to mention just a few of the practical
applications we had pursued. We came to believe, as a result of
our own experiences and those reported to us by others using
psychedelics, that they had the potential to facilitate for the
individual the experience of major insights and problem solutions
of an intellectual-emotional nature. The realm of these insights
or problem solutions is in any area which is meaningful to that
individual be it social or personal, intellectual, religious,
philosophical, things like that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was also our conviction that these insights,
enlightenment or solutions provided a firm educational foundation
for (a) change in the social or intellectual behaviour of the
individual, (b) the development of new models regarding the
nature of man along with suitable research designs to test such
models, (c) the development of more subtle methods of
communication between individuals and (d) the conceptualization
and formulation of modified social systems. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We tried to counter the criticisms by gathering
together some of the students who had used psychedelics, at which
time phenomenological reports were made. We also had two graduate
students in the Harvard Divinity School and one student from
M.I.T. Philosophy Department attending who were considering Ph.D.
dissertations in this area. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We also brought out a Newsletter in which we tried
to illustrate the impact of the psychedelic experience by quotes
from subjects' reports: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The atmosphere could hardly have been made more pleasant
    and congenial. The freedom, spontaneity, and personal warmth
    within the group and between members of the group became very
    meaningful. In these moments the psychology <i>vs</i>.
    theology business dropped off, the faculty-student barrier
    just did not matter, even the friend-stranger game was
    minimised. For these few moments we interacted not as role
    players or status seekers but as human beings&#151;men who
    share common sorrows and common joys, some of which we
    discussed. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Things going on inside me took all my attention. Early in
    my session I fastened upon the question of the distinction
    between knower and known, recalling Allport's and Hall and
    Lindzey's discussion of whether the self should be
    conceptualized in terms of the processes of knowing
    (self-as-subject, James' pure Ego) or in terms of the
    structures, patterns, abstractions by which one defines
    himself (self-as-object, proprium). It seemed to me that
    these were being dissociated in me, and I as knower was
    unable to confirm my knowing or to sustain my sense of
    identity by referring to any stable elements of myself. I
    recall looking at a Buddhist symbol, a circle divided into
    two S-shaped parts, one black and one white, with a centre in
    each of the semi-circles which formed the S. I struggled to
    bring the two centres together, as if &quot;the 1&quot; had
    to do so to survive. I can remember twisting and straining
    with all my might, saying I-I-I-I-I and somehow being aware
    that the batter of my universe was to maintain the
    &quot;I&quot; while all else was stripped away. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Two related feelings were present. One was a tremendous
    freedom to experience, to be I. It became very important to
    distinguish between <i>I</i> and <i>Me</i>, the latter being
    an object defined by patterns and structures and
    responsibilities&#151;all of which had vanished&#151;and the
    former being the subject experiencing and feeling. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'What it all means: First, for psychological theory. One
    striking aspect of the experience was the lack of sexual
    feelings or thoughts. We all commented upon this. Another was
    the lack of aggression&#151;moments of irritability produced
    only a desire to move away from the irritating one. Moreover,
    I experienced no developmental regression. While this does
    not in any way disprove Freudian theory, it makes it utterly
    irrelevant to this experience.... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'To begin with, the usual: the experience is so fantastic
    in both its novelty and its power as to beggar all
    possibility of adequate depiction through words. The most
    that can be hoped for by way of description is an
    approximation, and only those who have had the drug can know
    how far removed from actuality the approximation must be. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The things that can be said easily and unequivocally are:
    (I) My physical symptoms were a pronounced quaking which
    centred in my lower limbs, climaxing (I would judge) about
    one and a half hours after taking the drug but continuing off
    and on for about five hours; a slight stomach cramp for about
    ten hours; the feeling of physical depletion&#151;having been
    wrung through a wringer&#151;on coming out of the spell; and
    inability to sleep (bright flashes of light) until 3.00 a.m.
    (2) No disorientation&#151;at no point did I lose awareness
    of who I was, where I was, or the group experience that was
    underway. (3) Considerable apprehension, but no real terror
    or paranoia. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Now to the difficult part. The best way I can describe
    the experience as a whole is to liken it to an
    emotional-reflective-visual kaleidoscope, with the words
    listed in order of decreasing importance&#151;mood and
    emotion most important, thought next, visual (internal, of
    the sort you can get with your eyes closed) least. Experience
    involving these three components kept dissolving continuously
    from one pattern into another. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Emotionally the patterns ranged from serene contentment
    and mild euphoria to apprehension which bordered on, but
    never slipped into, alarm, but overwhelmingly they involved
    (a) astonishment at the absolutely incredible immensity,
    complexity, intensity and extravagance of being, existence,
    the cosmos, call it what you will. Ontological shock, I
    suppose. (b) The most acute sense of the poignancy,
    fragility, preciousness, and significance of all life and
    history. The latter was accompanied by a powerful sense of
    the responsibility of all for all&#151;all this, it must be
    pointed out, while lying comfortably and privately flat on
    one's back. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Intellectually, the dominant impression was that of
    entering into the very marrow of existence. Instead of
    looking at a painting, I was climbing into it, almost through
    it, as if to view it from behind. So too with being in
    general. It was as if each of the billion atoms of experience
    which under normal circumstances are summarised and averaged
    into crude, indiscriminate wholesale impressions was now
    being seen and savoured for itself. The other clear sense was
    that of cosmic relativity. Perhaps all experience <i>never</i>
    gets summarised in any inclusive over-view. Perhaps all there
    is is this everlasting congerie of an infinite number of
    discrete points of view, each summarising the whole from its
    perspective with the sum of all perspectives running the
    entire gamut from terror to absolute assurance and ecstasy. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'During the supper, after the two groups had gathered
    together I found myself disinclined to speak much. And the
    reason seemed clear&#151;and still does. Several times a
    thought began to take shape. But immediately one saw three or
    four feasible (and very different) ways any overt expression
    of it could be taken: straightforward, platitudinous,
    farcical, too personally revelatory to be publicly broadcast,
    etc. As language seemed too gross and clumsy to screen out
    the senses 1 did not intend, it seemed, not so much more
    prudent as more truthful in the sense of
    not-multiplying-misunderstanding, to remain for the most part
    quiet. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Felt clean&#151;cleansed, actually&#151;clear and happy
    the next day; the reverse to about equal degree the day
    following: normal, thereafter.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We also tried to scotch the rumours by 'coming out
front' and including mention of them in the Newsletter: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'During the fall of 1961 reports circulated in Manhattan
    literary, artistic and intellectual circles about the
    availability of black market hallucinogenic drugs, allegedly
    psilocybin. These substances were sold in liquid form.
    Because of our interest in the anthropology of
    consciousness-altering substances we investigated these
    reports. Conversations with a physician who analysed this
    liquid revealed it to be a form of LSD mixed with another
    substance, probably amphetamine. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'In December we were informed about the case of a
    well-known model who had been wandering for several weeks in
    lower Manhattan in a delirious state which was attributed to
    liquid &quot;mushrooms&quot;. A New York businessman who is
    producing a movie on the Mexican mushroom heard of this
    case&#151;his wife being a former friend of the model. The
    girl was located and a physician called. The girl made an
    apparent recovery. After a week, at the suggestion of the
    physician, and at our invitation the girl came to Boston for
    a rest. We had anticipated that we could assist her in
    integrating her experience into her life. However, she was
    immediately seen to be suffering from a severer psychosis. A
    psychiatrist was called and hospitalization arranged in a
    local hospital. Subsequent investigations have determined
    that the girl had probably been functionally psychotic for
    several months. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'On Saturday, morning 7 October, we were asked for help by
    an undergraduate who knew of our work and was concerned about
    his girl. It seemed that he had obtained (from New York) and
    taken a hallucinogen the previous evening and had spent this
    evening with his girl, who was, apparently, already quite
    emotionally disturbed as the result of a series of recent
    traumatic experiences. During the night, although the girl
    did not take any drugs herself, she was affected by the
    situation, so much so that she lost contact with reality a
    number of times during the course of the evening. After a
    review of the situation, we arranged for the girl to see a
    Cambridge psychiatrist whom she reported having visited
    previously. We have continued to see the boy up to the
    present time in order to help him integrate and make use of
    his experience. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'A recent rumour suggested that the punch at a University
    function had been &quot;spiked&quot; with hallucinogens by a
    student who obtained the material from us. In fact, our
    materials are carefully safeguarded and are signed out <i>only</i>
    to the members of our staff (who sign a requisition for all
    material) for specified research purposes. We were unable to
    ascertain the source of the rumour. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'In the fall of 1961 members of our research group were
    approached by and met twice with several young men who have
    been informally experimenting with conscious-altering
    substances. All of these young men were or had been Harvard
    undergraduates. They wanted to talk with us about their
    experiences, and particularly about their plans for a model
    free community in Mexico. Two of these young men did go to
    Mexico to look for a location, but they returned to
    Cambridge. To our knowledge no community has been
    established. In our discussions with these men we found them
    to be imaginative, decent, and full of youthful exuberance.
    We did nothing to encourage their use of conscious-altering
    substances. Rather, we expressed concern about the
    clandestine atmosphere in which they used these substances
    and talked very frankly with them about the frightening
    experiences that stem from secretiveness, suspicion, and
    fear.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Newsletter ended with a paragraph about 'Group
leaders': </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'There is, at present, a group of psychologists who,
    during the past year have become very familiar with
    psilocybin and its effects. They have each participated in a
    number of sessions both as member and leader. We start with
    this group as a nucleus of administrators. The group
    includes: Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert, Michael Kahn, George
    Litwin, Ralph Metzner, Gunther Weil, Ralph Schwitzgebel,
    Michael Hollingshead. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the paranoia was not restricted to Harvard. The
Press were having a field-day, and reports of our activities
began to appear in such mass-circulation magazines as <i>The
Reporter</i> ('The Hallucinogenic Drug Cult'); <i>Look</i>
('Weird Story of Harvard's Drug Scandal'), and even an article
entitled 'Psycho Chemicals as Weapons' which appeared in <i>The
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</i>, which prompted us to reply
in an article duly published in their next issue; our article was
headed 'The Politics of the Nervous System'.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The article by Dr. E. James Lieberman entitled
    &quot;Psycho Chemicals as Weapons&quot; (January, 1962) could
    lead to serious confusion in the minds of a credulous public
    and of a credulous military. The author seems to be moved by
    admirable democratic sentiments, but he has mixed together an
    astonishing combination of psychiatric folklore and chemical
    warfare fantasy. The results are misleading. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The so-called &quot;psychotropic weapons&quot;
    emphasised in this article are Lysergic Acid Diethylamide
    (LSD), Mescaline (the synthetic of the &quot;divine peyote
    cactus&quot;), and Psilocybin (the synthetic of the Sacred
    Mushroom of Mexico). The author, a psychiatrist, warns that
    &quot;catastrophic damage that would be neither reversible
    nor humane&quot; might follow the ingestion of these drugs. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Dr. Lieberman has presented one of the many
    sharply divergent viewpoints about the interpretation and
    application of these drugs. Many psychiatrists believe that
    LSD, Mescaline and Psilocybin produce psychiatric
    symptoms&#151;anxiety, depression, detachment, confusion,
    suspicion, psychosis. Many other investigators have come to
    the conclusion that these symptoms exist mainly in the mind
    and eye of the psychiatrist, and that consciousness-expanding
    chemicals, far from being dangerous weapons, may produce
    dramatic changes in personality leading to unprecedented
    peace, sanity and happiness. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Perhaps it depends on what you are trained to
    look for. Most psychiatrists who have experimented with such
    consciousness-affecting drugs report danger. Most
    non-psychiatrists see these drugs as great benefactors of
    mankind. Included in the latter group are Albert Hofmann, the
    brilliant bio-chemist, who first synthesised LSD and
    Psilocybin; Alan Watts, author and philosopher; Robert S. de
    Ropp, bio-chemist; Aldous Huxley, novelist and philosopher;
    and the great American psychologist and philosopher, William
    James. Also included among those who hail the humanistic
    promise of consciousness-expanding drugs are a few
    psychiatrists who have seen beyond psychopathology to the
    adaptive potentials of the human brain. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'So much for the controversial. Research and
    not words will resolve these issues. But let us look next at
    the secure knowledge which exists concerning Mescaline, LSD,
    and Psilocybin. What are these substances? Sacramental foods?
    Devilish weapons? Wonder medicines? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'It is easier to say what they are not. They
    are not addictive, nor sedative, nor intoxicating. There is
    no evidence for any lasting and very few transient physical
    effects. Everyone agrees on one factor&#151;they dramatically
    alter consciousness and expand awareness. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'There is a second generally shared conclusion.
    Set and suggestibility, expectation and emotional atmosphere
    account for almost all of the specificity of reaction. If the
    drug-giver is supportive, open, relaxed, then the results
    will usually be positive, educational, dramatically
    insightful. If, on the other hand, the drug-giver is
    secretive, depersonalised, himself fearful of the drug, then
    the reactions will probably be anxious and unpleasant. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'As members of a research project studying the
    effects and application of consciousness-expanding drugs, we
    have had the opportunity during the last eighteen months of
    observing the behavioural and phenomenological reactions of
    over 300 subjects. A glance at some of our results suggests
    that the military applications of consciousness-expanding
    drugs may be limited. Ninety-one per cent of the Americans
    who have participated in our research report pleasant,
    inspirational experiences. Even with no attempt to be
    therapeutic, and with only one ingestion, over sixty per cent
    of our subjects report subsequent life changes for the
    better. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'During the past twelve months we have used
    these drugs for rehabilitation purposes in a maximum security
    prison. During more than 100 individual ingestions
    with-hardened criminals we have witnessed dramatic insight
    and behaviour change reactions. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Like any product of our advanced technology,
    the consciousness-expanding drugs can be used to manipulate;
    to dominate, to frighten or to benefit mankind. A hypodermic
    syringe of LSD or Salk vaccine in the hands of an enemy can
    become a frightening weapon. However, the greatest enemies of
    mankind are ignorance and fear. In the hands of the
    unfriendly, these weapons&#151;ignorance and fear&#151;can
    paralyse and destroy. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'What are the protections? Accurate
    information, openly shared, calm, courageous response to the
    evidence. Psychiatrists and physicians (on whom Dr. Lieberman
    calls for rescue from danger, perhaps imaginary) can help to
    the extent they are collaborative, open, fearless with their
    fellow men. If the American people are frightened by
    psychopathological obsessions and psychiatric superstitions
    and ill-kept chemical warfare secrets, they can be hurt. We
    are least vulnerable and strongest when we are well-informed.
    Facts are the defence against any weapon, and particularly
    the psychological weapons of fear and helplessness. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The facts about consciousness-expanding
    substances are not all in yet, but some things are clear.
    Physiologically these substances act mainly on the brain
    stem, disinhibiting certain regulating, selecting, screening
    and controlling mechanisms that constantly guide our
    perception and thinking. The higher, conscious centres are
    free temporarily from these artificial restrictions.
    Behaviourally the main effect of these substances is
    relaxation. Most of our subjects are very happy just to sit
    and enjoy the world. There is much less talking, much less
    superficial movement or conversation. Let us be clear, almost
    all of our subjects could function very adequately if called
    on. They choose to relax. Psychologically these amazing
    substances expand your awareness, they open your mind. The
    kaleidoscopic and complex world that has always been there,
    the powerful sensations from every part of your body and the
    unusual connections of thoughts and feelings that are
    normally ignored come dramatically into consciousness. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Of course these experiences can be
    frightening. If you are not prepared, if you do not know what
    is happening to you and your brain, if you are struggling to
    maintain complete verbal control over your senses and your
    awareness, you will certainly be frightened and angry. But if
    you are prepared, if you know what kind of a chemical you
    have taken and what to expect (which most subjects
    participating in psychiatric research with these substances
    do not), if you do relax, then the experience can be
    wonderful, enlightening, and life-changing. If an enemy does
    drop LSD in the water supply and if you are accurately
    informed and prepared, then you have two choices. If you have
    the time and inclination you should sit back and enjoy the
    most exciting education experience of your life (you might be
    forever grateful to the saboteur). If you don't have the time
    or the inclination for this pleasant and insightful
    experience, then swallow a tranquilliser (which is a good
    antidote) and you'll be back to the prosaic reality. Tomorrow
    the drugs and the counter-drugs may be different, but the
    prescription is the same. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'If an enemy introduced a
    consciousness-expanding drug into a military command centre,
    our leaders (if they are accurately informed and experienced
    about the potentials of expanded awareness) might find that
    men in certain key positions could function better. In fact,
    we must assume that these substances are now being used by
    our space agency for the preparation of cosmonauts, who will
    certainly undergo altered states of consciousness in space
    exploration. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Your brain is your own. Intelligent, open
    collaboration can expand your mind&#151;with words and with
    drugs. Only ignorance and misinformation can allow someone
    else to control it&#151;with their own words or with their
    drugs or with their imaginary fears.' </p>

<h4>CHAPTER THREE</h4>

<h3>LEARY FLIES HIS JOLLY ROGER<br>
FROM THE IVY TOWER</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<h4>1962</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the Harvard Psychedelic Project grew in both
numbers of people and sessions, and as we become more aware of
the effects of these drugs, it seemed that the hinterland of the
'psychedelic mind' is <i>not</i> the obscure forest in which
Blake saw his tiger, nor the dream-world from which Coleridge
conjured the mysteries of Christabel and Kubla Kahn. It was a
place altogether different, and much more mysterious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We studied the reports from students using LSD or
psilocybin, and began to chart maps of their interior space
(which we also compared with our own experiences). We were
hopeful that some of the mystery would thereby be revealed to us,
for the 'psychedelic experience' looks intelligible enough. But
here we came to certain other realisations. That this Other World
is vibrant with strange energy transformations and exists&#151;if
it exists at all&#151;in another dimension of mind or self; like
the inside of an atom, it is a space forever recreating itself
and its own mystery. The more we began to peer into it, the less
we could actually 'see'. It seemed to proceed, under pretence of
showing you how it works, to display a series of much more
surprising worlds. It might be called a more or less 'magical
preparation'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All we could say at this time was that this Other
World could be experienced as the moment when one emerges from
the prison of 'limited mind' and becomes identified&#151;by the
simplest but most intense of the acts of mental life&#151;with
the 'limitless mind', whatever it may be, however slight. And we
felt this form of identification or sense of 'oneness', far from
being an acquired or learned state of mental discipline, was a
natural state, the only true natural state for man to be. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was then but a short step from this realisation
to individual members of the project linking their secret
'psychedelic life' to the Beyond. And all sorts of claims on
behalf of LSD <i>et al</i>. were made on the campus. Some
advocates of the psychedelic experience suggested that God may
himself be at work in these biochemical compounds, and would
quote the work of W. T. Stace, William James even Henri Bergson,
in support of their growing mystical beliefs. Professor Huston
Smith of M.I.T. said that the subjective drug experiences are
sometimes 'strikingly like those reported by mystics, seers, and
visionaries of the past'. And in an extensive questionnaire study
of eighty-two subjects who took psychedelics at Harvard, the
following 'mystical' characteristics were cited by well over half
the subjects as occurring 'quite a lot' or 'among the most
important aspects of my experience': <i>loss of time sense;
objects snore significant and beautiful; being able to operate
out several levels at once; extreme pleasure, ecstasy, cosmic
joy, paradise; feeling of being very wise, knowing everything;
feeling that nothing need be said.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Freud, at the basis of the human
personality lies sex and aggression, the twin poles of deep
consciousness around which we revolve. But we found that when the
ego-personality was ripped away completely, which can happen
during an intensive LSD experience, what was left was 'purest
love' and a sense of oneness with all living creatures. No sex;
no aggression. Subjects felt free of anger, pity, and disgust. It
was as though the supremely ordinary human aspiration to be free
could be reached, albeit only briefly, by means of these drugs,
which is perhaps what Freud meant when he also spoke of 'the
Nirvana instinct' in man, this yearning for peace which lies at
the very core of our being. It has always seemed to me a pity
that Freud did not write more about the mystical or spiritual
dimensions of knowing, for he was obviously aware of the
existence within realms which do not easily fall into the
categories of psychoanalysis. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in New England in 1962 the subject of mysticism
was one that, for most people, was synonymous with religious
faith. And so it was rather natural for project members to turn
to spiritual masters in order to help them identify the nature of
their new experiences, which were not like anything they had ever
imagined before. It was the start of their search for an answer
to the riddle of consciousness or for the Grail, as for something
from the sky. They felt certain in their own minds that what they
had undergone was something which they had personally experienced
deeply, and not really something which they had done for
themselves. It was a gift from God, a gratuitous grace, aided and
abetted by modern synthetic chemistry. God was not only in his
heaven all right; he was also here with each single one of us,
but wholly within. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Naturally, the 'good news' quickly spread across
the Harvard campus, and the sort of feedback we got suggested
that the rest of the faculty thought Dr. Leary was starting a new
religion, with psychedelics as the new sacraments. And to the
rest of the psychology faculty, this was absolute heresy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, we began to experiment closer to home,
as it were, trying to find other areas in which these substances
could be used, particularly those with distressed or helpless
people, for whom life had become one long unrelieved struggle.
Such was the case with prisoners at the maximum security prison
at Concord, just north of Boston. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim Leary had had the good vision to see that if a
large-dose acid session could help end-of-the-line alcoholics, it
might also work with 'hard-core' criminal recidivists. And he had
spelled out a research project, using psychedelics, to the
officials at the Massachusetts Department of Correction, the
Department of Legal Medicine, and to the head of the Harvard
Social Relations Department. After a lot of hassle and red-tape
cutting, the proposal was accepted; and thus began a unique and
very successful experiment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We started slowly, with small groups of three or
four prisoners and two members of the Harvard group (who at this
time included, in addition to Leary and myself, Dr. Allan Cohen,
Dr. Alfred Alschuder, Dr. George Litwin, Dr. Ralph Metzner, Dr.
Gunther Weil, and Dr. Ralph Schwitzgebel, with Dr. Madison
Presnell as the medical and psychiatric adviser). We would
usually work in pairs, and go to the prison twice a week, with
one of the days given over to running the prisoners' psychedelic
sessions, which were held in a locked room in the prison
hospital, and one of the days devoted to planning future sessions
or in follow-up discussions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not a psychologist and it would be ridiculous
if I were to attempt to give a scientific appraisal of the
Harvard-Concord prison project. But one thing is certain, the
sessions 'worked' in the sense that very few of the inmates who
underwent the intensive LSD or psilocybin sessions ever came back
(which was the whole point of the exercise). Statistically, fifty
to seventy per cent of inmates paroled or released return within
a five-year period, with a nationwide average of sixty-seven per
cent. We found that one and a half years after the termination of
our project the return rate had been reduced to seven per cent,
which is a completely objective index of success. How did we
achieve these results ? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After an initial discussion meeting with an inmate,
when he would be told about the drugs and the kind of effects
they produced, we would then meet three or four more times to
plan his session. We explained to him how he would 'lose his ego'
and soar off into 'non-game' worlds of experience, and how this
would enable him to see himself and his criminal games with
greater clarity. We also encouraged the prisoners to propose the
kind of changes they would like to see happen within themselves,
which might take the form of a hefty South Boston American
Irishman saying 'I want to understand what drinking means to me'
or a coloured inmate from Georgia 'I want to get over my
paranoia'. We would also draw 'internal maps', huge circles in
which we could fill in the expected positive changes and note
areas of the personality best avoided in a session. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the day of the session, we would get to the
prison early, and after chatting to the guards as we moved
through the different locked doors to the prison hospital, we
would assemble the group of perhaps six inmates; and then all
take the psychedelic&#151;which included, of course, ourselves,
since only by taking the drug with them could their fear and
suspicion and paranoia be averted. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The physical setting was the best we could do under
the circumstances&#151;we spread mattresses all over the floor,
played taped pop and Indian music, made sure that the session
would not be interrupted by visitors or guards and thus that the
atmosphere would be relaxed and open and permissive. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We found that it was best not to really <i>do</i>
anything during the session, except be there and give reassurance
to anyone who started getting paranoid or fearful; everyone was
best left free to explore whatever material came up, whether it
be entirely personal or involve personal issues with any of the
others present. We found that in a benign, supportive, friendly
session and with a favourable mental set on the part of each
subject, the drug produced a detachment from everyday thoughts
and actions which was correlative with an increase in degrees of
reflectiveness and insights into normal behaviour patterns and in
turn opened up the way for the construction of alternatives. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For those of us responsible for conducting the
sessions, our orientation was, to quote Gerald Heard, the British
philosopher who first introduced Aldous Huxley to mescaline, ' .
. . concerned but not anxious, interested but not engrossed,
diagnostic but not critical, aware of the seriousness of what is
being conveyed and all the more incapable of coldness or shock,
aloofness or dismay'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what about the inmate, for whom the psychedelic
experience came as something not far removed from, if not
actually akin to revelation ? I think for the majority the
experience was intense and highly emotional, with hallucinations
of colours, of positive and frightening scenes; yet it apparently
stimulated them to do some thinking about their lives and what
they were doing with them. One inmate, who initially presented
the classic picture of a 'hardened criminal' of the well-known
American variety, emerged from his heavy shell as a sensitive,
lonely, child-like human being. At the time when I was feeling
highest I had a terrific feeling of sadness and loneliness, and a
feeling of great remorse at all these wasted years . . . and of
the harsh and brutal things I have done in order to survive at
all.... ' Or another, a twenty-eight-year-old coloured brother
who was serving a five-year sentence for robbery and had attended
a school for retarded children till the age of seventeen: 'I kept
saying to myself in thought&#151;where do you belong ? Where do
you belong?' And yet another inmate, a forty-eight-year-old man
serving time on charges of theft, forgery, larceny and escape
with a prior history of thirty arrests, the first one being at
the age of twelve: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>' . . . before taking this drug my thinking always seemed
    to travel in the same circles&#151;drinking, gambling, money
    and sex, I guess what you'd call a fast life. Now my thoughts
    are troubled and at times quite confusing, but they are all
    of an honest nature, and of wondering. I feel somehow
    detached now from prison life, uninterested in gambling or
    even talking to the other cons, except those in the group. I
    think I now know what I want to be and I am sincere in my
    mind when I say that I want to make it so. Because the drug
    opened my mind and I got a better understanding of myself and
    also of the other people in the group, I now feel free to say
    and discuss things, which you generally do not do.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (He was discharged a few months after his first
session and obtained a job with a construction company; he worked
ten to thirteen hours a day and one month later he was promoted
to assistant foreman. A few months later he became assistant cook
in a large restaurant. Ten years later he was still out and
running his own auto body paint shop.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But perhaps the most interesting of all the
prisoners who took part in the project is Jimmy Kerrigan, one of
the 'notorious' Kerrigan Brothers, a safe-cracker and part of the
Irish mafia, who is still serving out his sentence, even as I
write these lines, some twelve years after the events I have been
describing. When the project terminated, which it did with
Leary's dismissal from Harvard, Kerrigan continued the programme
but without using drugs, and started a group within the prison
called The Concord Self-Development Group to assist its members
to sort out their lives' priorities and to give guidance on
job-getting and how to 'go straight'. He got together this group
composed of inmates, starting with the ones who had been in the
drug programmer who then voluntarily pledged themselves to help
each other find a new direction in life that would not
automatically lead straight back to prison. I recently received a
brochure from Jim in which the aims of SDG are spelled out. It
ends with a list of questions that each member has to ask
himself, first alone and then with the rest; and 'a hypothetical
case history': </p>

<p><center> RESULTANT SITUATION</center> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Concord, five years, indefinite sentence,
feeding off fantasy and delusion for the most part; identified
with the 'boys'; satisfied with sense of belonging to rebellious
fragments of society; 'real' people are people in trouble, in
jail. The rest are 'way out'. No communication via legitimate
channels nor respect for norms of community. </p>

<p><center> THERAPY SUGGESTED</center> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reduction of fear, fantasy, and hang-ups, via open
discussions in small group, with trained inmates (A A's; Harvard
Experimental Group; Legal Medicine) who wish to pass it on. Crash
programme (classes two hours; once, twice, or more often per
week) towards self-development, consideration of proper goals and
attainable achievements tailored to variable individual
potential. Readiness for follow-up outside programme. Finally,
acceptance of social norms with respect for self and others in
all areas worthy of same. </p>

<p> It seemed to me then, as indeed it still does, that LSD can
be useful if it helps a person free himself of his habitual
patterns of thought or some kind of 'absolute' sense of identity
in order to see aspects of his life and reality as it concerns
him personally. It is useful for what it can yield in terms of
self-understanding, and is fruitful if it causes someone in a bad
life situation to exert himself to overcome it and learn how to
adapt the new insights to his needs. I think that perhaps for the
majority of the thirty or so prisoners with whom [ had sessions
at Concord, something happened during their experience that took
them beyond the falsifications of rote-consciousness and, in
time, led them individually to achieve a simple awareness and
even affirmation of the world. There is a little light burning in
each one of us which is something we are all too inclined to
forget, though with sometimes quite terrible consequences. And if
a psychedelic-associated programme is shown to help 'hard-core'
cons regain the lost light of that which makes them truly human,
then it is sad when politics and unconscious attitudes work
against those who would like to share something of their
experience and knowledge in precisely these human areas. If we
call a man an animal and then put him behind bars, we should not,
after all, be too surprised if later he reacts against us with
ferocity; it is perhaps significant that Charles Manson spent
over fifteen years inside various jails <i>before</i> he let the
society of plain and ordinary people know precisely what kind of
animal they had turned him into, though our admiration can be
given to such men as George Jackson, Eldridge Cleaver, Huey
Newton, Jimmy Kerrigan who, despite absolutely dehumanising
conditions over long periods of time, were nonetheless able to
detach themselves sufficiently from the 'prison system' and keep
some kind of light of humanity burning within themselves,
sufficient at any rate to preserve their sanity. Perhaps mankind
needs to discover a new culture of humanity before it is all too
late in a world that finally submerges into deepening chaos,
which will only happen if we find alarm-clocks sufficiently
powerful to wake us from the sort of sleepwalking existence which
nowadays passes for 'normality'. </p>

<p> Enough, enough; let us pass on or rather back to the Harvard
of 1962 and try to understand how LSD helped spawn a 'generation
of visionary maniac white mother country dope fiend rock and roll
freaks'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had got to know Leary quite well by now; not only
was I installed as a member of his household in the Boston suburb
of Newton Centers but I would accompany him each day to the
Harvard office, which we now ran as a sort of command
headquarters for planning sessions. There had been a rapid
acceleration of interest in the drug programme, and it was not
long before we had a constant stream of visitors asking about LSD
and psilocybin, and their availability. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But perhaps one of our most curious visitors was a
young man called Walter Pahnke, who was, incidentally, both an
M.D. and a Bachelor of Divinity. He was also a candidate for the
Ph.D. in the Philosophy of Religion at Harvard, had studied
Christian mystical literature and had established nine categories
which he felt described a genuine mystical experience. It now
occurred to him that if a group of extremely religious
individuals were to take a psychedelic drug, then they too might
also have a genuine mystical experience. He wanted to know
whether Leary would help him run a drug experiment for twenty
divinity school students from the Andover-Newton Theological
Seminary, ten of whom would be given a psychedelic, and the other
ten an amphetamine. The plan was to run the session on Good
Friday in Marsh Chapel at Boston University, a long-established
Methodist-affiliated institution. It was a breathtaking proposal,
though it only took Tim thirty seconds to agree wholeheartedly
and commit himself to planning the session. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We had by this time run or arranged over one
thousand psychedelic sessions for persons from all walks of life,
including fifty scientists, quite a number of artists and
musicians and writers, sixty-nine full-time religious
professionals. We also had a religious advisory committee that
included two college deans, a divinity school president, three
university chaplains, an executive of a religious foundation, a
prominent religious editor, and several distinguished religious
philosophers. We felt that with all this experience we could cope
with any drug-associated contingencies, including this one. This
particular session was to be later sensationalised in the
American press as 'The Miracle of Marsh Chapel, though perhaps
the only real miracle surrounding it was the one of actually
getting Walter Pahnke's Ph.D. dissertation accepted. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As I was to be one of the 'guides', I was naturally
very curious to meet the twenty students who had volunteered to
take part in this experiment. Our first meeting took place at the
Theological Seminary, and Tim began to explain a little about the
physical and subjective effects of psychedelics, though none of
the students, I believe, had ever taken anything stronger than an
aspirin in their lives. There were one or two questions, but on
the whole the group seemed relaxed if not actually looking
forward eagerly to what was to become for them a most memorable
Good Friday. One of their professors, Dr. Walter Clark, who had
himself used psychedelics, was careful to point out that it
should not be believed that psychedelic drugs are in themselves
religious. He said it was a bit like organ music, which may be
the means to a religious experience for some people. He also said
that drugs had been used in esoteric religious rituals, from the
days of antiquity right up to Boston in 1962, 'presumably as a
stimulus to religious experience'. During any profound emotional
experience, he pointed out, religious or otherwise, chemical or
hormonal bodily changes occur. 'Furthermore, we know that the
natural chemistry of the body includes biochemical substances,
known as <i>indoles</i>, which are similar in structure to the
consciousness-expanding chemicals and seem to be associated with
some of the same psychological states as those produced by LSD
and psilocybin. The question then immediately arises whether a
naturally-occurring excess of the indoles might not predispose
some people to certain kinds of mystical experience or whether a
mystical state of mind might not, on the other hand, stimulate
chemical changes in the body.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All the students again agreed to take part
voluntarily in a systematic demonstration of the religious
aspects of a psychedelic revelatory experience along the lines we
had suggested. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a double-blind experiment. The students were
divided into five groups of four persons, each group with its own
guide, who met with them before the session for orientation and
preparation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, on the day, we all arrived at 10.00 a.m.
at the Chapel. Everyone seemed serious, almost reverential, and
Dr. Pahnke busied himself with the preparation of the drugs,
which he was to administer. There had been a last-minute flap
when Harvard University Officials, an <i>ad hoc</i> faculty group
'to advise and oversee' future drug studies, headed by Dr. Robert
Bales, refused to release to the experimenters the supply of
drugs held by Dr. Dana Farnsworth, head of the Harvard Health
Service and one of the protagonists of the Pahnke experiment.
Nevertheless, after representatives had been despatched to round
up a sufficient quantity of 'non-Harvard' acid, there was enough
to go round, mostly from my mayonnaise jar. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The session took place in a small, private chapel
sited underneath the main building, one hour before noon on Good
Friday, with the reverent sound of the story of Christ piped in
by loudspeakers. The service would last for three hours and would
consist of prayers, spoken meditations and readings from the
Bible, periods of silent meditation, and religious music. We were
asked by the minister to maintain a reverent silence during the
service. My little group of four were amongst those who received
the psychedelic (neither the students, guides, nor experimenter
knew beforehand who received the psychedelic); but it was pretty
obvious after about thirty minutes, when one of my students
normally a shy, sensitive person, given to reading aloud large
passages of Donne's poetry, suddenly began to tear the buttons
off his jacket and declared that he was a fish. Another student
had meanwhile slipped silently off the pew on to the Chapel
floor, where he began to slowly gyrate like a huge snake. The
other two seemed quite okay; one was sitting bolt upright, his
eyes staring fixatedly at the huge crucifix on the high altar, an
insane grin on his face, and with his hands clasped tightly
together, as though clutching his last remaining $5 note; whilst
the fourth member lay stretched out and as stiff as a board on an
empty pew, a position he somehow managed to retain during the
entire service, and then only coming to again after a huge
injection of Thorazine had been administered. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I finally managed to subdue the student tearing off
his buttons, but not before he had removed all of them off both
his coat and his trousers and thrown his dental plate at the
altar, much to the surprise of the students who had been given
the amphetamine, who sat huddled together in the front pews,
nervous and not very sure about where their own heads were at. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was of course quite a lot of activity going
on with the other groups who had been given the drug, almost
total confusion, in fact with some of the students climbing
across the pews, and one actually standing facing the crucifix,
arms stretched out as if somehow able to identify physically with
Christ and his suffering on the cross. One student even managed
to get outside the Chapel and was almost killed when he walked
into the traffic on Boston's Commonwealth Avenue, 'believing he
was Christ and nothing could touch him'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, at two o'clock, when the story of Christ
had reached its conclusion, we all retired to an adjoining room
for discussions; since many of the students were still completely
under the influence of the drug, however, we decided instead that
we should all drive back to Tim's house, where our girl-friends
had arranged a wine-and-cheese lunch, which we could have whilst
taking turns to stay with those who were still out of it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (While most religious leaders would probably be
unenthusiastic over the idea of the drugged approach to religion,
<i>Archives of General Psychiatry</i> reported that earlier that
year one lawsuit brought attention to a pastor who told his
congregation that LSD could bring them closer to God.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Leary, the Good Friday session was something of
a personal triumph, and he began increasingly to study literary
accounts of religious ecstasies from such pens as those of
Wordsworth, Tennyson, Virginia Woolf, and even C. P. Snow, as
well as personal experiences from classical mystics like Teresa
of Avila, van Ruysbroeck, Plotinus, and Saint Augustine; he was
also at this time getting into Eastern mystical thought and read
extensively from the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, <i>I Ching</i>,
Vedanta, the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>, Christ's Sermon on the Mount,
Zen, Buddhism, Sufism, Hinduism and so forth. He believed at this
time that in LSD he had found a truly religious 'sacrament', and
one not too different from the Vedic Soma, the Dionysian nectar,
the Greek ambrosia, the Mexican mushroom, the Red Indian's
peyote, or the Chama Indian's ayahuasca. 'When the day
comes&#151;as it surely will&#151;that sacramental biochemicals
like LSD will be as routinely and tamely used as organ music and
incense to assist in attainment of religious experience, it may
well be that the ego-shattering effect of the drug will be
diminished,' he later wrote, and added 'Such may be one aspect of
the paradoxical nature of religious experience.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This call for acceptance of LSD as an aid to
genuine spiritual revivification was not only picked up by many
people seeking answers to their own spiritual problems, but also
by some of his professional colleagues who were in all other
respects highly cautious scientists. Indeed, one of them, Dr.
Frank Barron, a distinguished member of The Centre for Research
in Personality at Berkeley, wrote the following: 'There is a new
time coming, and we shall know it when it happens, when LSD is
interpreted by those who use it as the source for the energy that
is to transform human consciousness.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But it must also be appreciated that part of the
problem Leary faced at this time was in finding a 'model'
acceptable to society at large in which LSD could be legitimately
used. And religion certainly seemed more promising as a prospect
than psychology, despite the drug's promise as an 'adjunct' to
psychotherapy, prisoner rehabilitation, and the treatment of
alcoholics; besides which, he was coming in for considerable
criticism from many sectors of the American academic community,
where it was widely believed that the drug sessions at Harvard
were being run nonchalantly and irresponsibly. Dr. Herbert C.
Kelman, a lecturer in Social Psychology at Harvard, reported he
had observed that graduate students who had had LSD experiences
had formed a clannish 'insider group', and wrote: 'I doubt
whether this project is carried out primarily as an intellectual
endeavour or whether it is being pursued as a new kind of
experience to offer an answer to man's ills.' John U. Monro, dean
of Harvard College, wrote a letter to the editor of <i>The
Harvard Crimson</i> newspaper, warning of 'the effects of LSD,
psilocybin, mescaline and other mind-distorting drugs,' which ' .
. . have been known to intensify seriously a tendency toward
depression and to produce other dangerous psychotic effects.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet religion was still very much a new area for
Leary. I think his scientific training was the source of his
thoroughness and even of his originality as a talker, for on the
whole he did not always write very well. There was always a hint
of journalism in what he wrote, a too-easy tendency to slacken
off for long passages at a time, into just something not far
removed from the jargon of the hipster, and the related facility
that suggests, if not exactly knowingness, at least a feeling
that he is never at a loss, an essentially 'olympian'
preparation. He was a follower of Mao and Dionysus, Freud and
Epicurus, and this was never more apparent then when he tried to
define the religious situation. It was difficult to take him
seriously as a 'prophet' or a 'holy man' or a 'high priest'; it
was easier to see him as an inspired impresario, an Appolinaire,
or a Cocteau. Yet he sought to find a common ground on which both
science and religion could meet. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Science is a social system which evolves roles, rules,
    values, language, space-time locations to further the quest
    for these goals&#151;these answers. Religion is a social
    system which has evolved its roles, rules, rituals, values,
    language, space-time locations to further the pursuit of the
    same goals&#151;the revelatory experience. A science which
    fails to address itself to these spiritual goals, which
    accepts other purposes (however popular), becomes secular,
    political, and tends to oppose new data. A religion which
    fails to provide direct experiential answers to these
    spiritual questions becomes secular, political and tends to
    oppose the individual revelatory confrontation.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He found it hard to see how his results&#151;which
read: seventy-five per cent 'spiritual revelation'&#151;could be
disregarded by those who were professionally concerned with
spiritual matters and individual religious development. But
disregard them they did. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, far from convincing everybody that the New
Religion is really dedicated to the idea that we should only
think of ways in which to bring-each other up, not down, he only
succeeded in putting up people's backs. The problem was to find a
sufficient number of people left who would listen to what he had
to say. And part of this difficulty was due to a lack of
austerity in the presentation, which alone guaranteed- public
discussion though not necessarily of a kind calculated to produce
either consensus or rational inquiry. Yet despite Leary's various
resources of honesty and intelligence, his quest for
understanding must in some sense be a frustrating one. Whatever
his ideas or ideals, no two authorities seemed to agree with one
another and each would be the first to declare that he alone
spoke with authority. 'Lots of blacksmiths whose monopoly is
threatened.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary felt that LSD's significance lay beyond all
social analysis and all psychological categories and, since the
drug experience was completely unique, a new model was needed, a
new structure. It presupposed a readiness on the part of those
who used it to undertake a series of new departures, perpetual
readiness to expose oneself to new mental dimensions, even to new
forms of 'reality'. In that sense, no two sessions are ever the
same; each one provides an entirely personal, and at times,
highly idiosyncratic encounter with the self, with each person
becoming his own explorer. So that each session acts as a bridge
between one reality and another, and to the internal voyager
represents perhaps an attempt to penetrate into the deeper
reality below the externals of egocentric consciousness. And thus
the voyager returns, bringing back an inventive fertility and
diversity of experiences to talk about, to illustrate, through
art, through words, through music, through being. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a serious writer, Leary had to throw away the
chance of seducing readers or listeners with too ready-made a
view of human categories. Again and again he demanded that the
reader, too, open himself to the new and unfamiliar, as indeed he
had done himself. He began to speak of 'Man's Fifth
Freedom&#151;the freedom to use your own head and on your own
terms', and of 'The Politics of Consciousness Expansion'. And the
more he used words, the less the clarity of expression. 'We must
entertain nonverbal methods of communication if we are to free
our nervous system from the tyranny of the stifling simplicity of
words,' he wrote in an article published in <i>The Harvard Review</i>.
He wanted the freedom to live close to the hermetic and the
incommunicable and even to the refusal of all language.
Certainly, within those of us using LSD, it was developing a new
sensibility, a new awareness, there was something wholesome about
it, something healthy and vital. It had laid claim to new areas
of its own, and we wanted to share our knowledge with the world.
Verbal tricks were out. We had to make of our language an
entirely new instrument of communication, something to be
undertaken in the spirit of renewal, with a kind of reverence
which you find in acts of faith. The freedom we sought was not
the freedom to say or do what we liked, but freedom as a value
(internal freedom), something intangible yet also somehow more
real. We saw that the traditional means for expanding or
contracting consciousness such as the printing press, the
television screen, the radio transmitter, the movies, were
restricted by law and remained under government control. How then
were we to change this situation? For the purposes of describing
the psychedelic experience in 1962, he had no language, no
trained operators, just a vision that a new language would
inevitably develop to transfigure every one of our social forms. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'It is possible that in twenty years our psychological and
    experiential language (pitifully small in English) will have
    multiplied to cover realms of experience and forms of
    thinking now unknown. In twenty years, every social
    institution will have been transformed by the new insights
    provided by consciousness-expanding experiences. Many new
    social institutions will have developed to handle the
    expressions of the potentiated nervous system.' (Leary). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps because poetry is most responsive to the
change of human sensibility or awareness, and is the only true
advance guard of language today, much of the new 'visionary'
poetry is written in lines of simple word associations, that is,
with the poet taking his ease among words; he prefers a limpid
image which floats rather than runs, an image more natural than
precise, and in general strives for a direct, less intellectual
expression or emotion. He sees the manipulative verbal machinery
for what it is, an ego-oriented, aggressive, goal-oriented,
fear-ridden, guilty, unconscious use of language. According to
the American poet, Gerde Stern, 'In a world of simultaneous
operations you don't have to be first to be on top. We are
dealing with word as it exists in our own world as an object in
sight and sound. This is a unique role for the word, which before
our time has been a thing of thought and breath or written and
printed on paper, more of a private experience than in public
media like billboards, signs, radio and television. Most people
still long for a world of one-thing-at-a-timeness.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But it was not only true for poets. Artists, too,
were having to readjust their work to match their new insights,
find new forms of expression, use novel techniques to describe
this brave new world of sensory experience. They needed an art
that would reflect a deeper layer of consciousness; colour and
especially shape or form became in themselves more meaningful
than any object they might represent. 'Photographic' imitations
of appearances were less interesting than patterns of colour
which have a power to move us and in ways which we little
understand. The psychedelic artist was 'aware' of sensory
patterns in the intense way that the Tantric artist is; that is,
he created his art out of whatever it was that he had discovered
within himself, which in turn was commensurate with an increase
in degrees of reflectiveness. The artist who 'turned on' to his
own psychosomatic body wanted to recreate this experience
immediately in visual terms which electricity made possible. He
was no longer surface-bound to a piece of canvas or to imitations
of the world of external appearances for he had become more
universal&#151;now he could soar off into these new sensory
realms of human experience. He understood the meaning of such
words as 'liberation' and 'freedom', not only with reference to
his own life but in the life of his art. And he knew that the
visible form would have to be a direct expression of the
'electric' 'pulsating' centre of which he had become aware. Thus
it might seem to those who saw art as simply 'images' or aspects
of nature, that the psychedelic artist&#151;who flooded the room
with colour, movement, sound, and light&#151;was unconcerned with
outer form, and of course they were right. For psychedelic art is
expressive of an inner rhythm, like that of music. And the
spectator who is not possessed of a self-conscious similar to the
artist's, will never understand what response is expected of him.
For the psychedelic artist is learning how to make himself part
of the mystery of his own being by 'seeing' it, living in it;
here can be no sense of separatedness, no difference between 'Me'
and 'Thee'&#151;'We are all one,' he says; 'the art, the
spectator, and the artist are one. Threefold Always.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This may go some way to explaining the widespread
use of psychedelics at pop concerts, for truly great pop music
must present a frame to enable the spectator to merge with the
sound and the colour, and the musician achieves authenticity by
means of the language of 'visual music' expressed in the beauties
of his world of electronic simultaneities (Jimi Hendrix). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It would be a mistake simply to dismiss this New
High Art as an art of naivet, mental or logical deficiency, or
general benightedness since it presupposes that the spectator has
also been able to move beyond his ordinary relative vision and is
thus able to get into the invisible forces within his own deepest
self in order to 'see more seeingly'. And it is the psychedelic
experience that frees one, albeit temporarily, of any 'absolute'
sense of identity in order that one may soar off into the flux. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychedelic artist would rather see his art as
something that arose out of the alembic of self, as a piece of
reality salvaged out of the flux, which manifested itself in his
consciousness from the hidden depths of his being, somewhat
similar to the cave paintings of primitive man, which also arose
out of the experience of living. He is trying to express
something in a non-conceptual, highly-figurative and often
emotive way, through symbols which may themselves be magical,
i.e. that have the power to <i>turn us on</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychedelic artists had found a means of
communicating directly what they had experienced internally. But
what of the rest of us ? As Leary put it&#151; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'We are, in a real sense, prisoners of our cognitive
    concepts and strategies. Passed on from generation to
    generation. The cognitive continuity of history. Our current
    reliance upon substantive and &quot;closing-off&quot;
    concepts will be the amused wonder of coming generations. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The danger is not physical or psychological,
    but social political. Make no mistake: the effect of
    consciousness-expanding drugs will be to transform our
    concepts of human nature, of human potentialities, of
    existence. The game is about to be changed, ladies and
    gentlemen. Man is about to make use of that fabulous
    electrical network he carries around in his skull. Present
    social establishments had better be prepared for the change.
    Our favourite concepts are standing in the way of a
    floodtide, two billion years building up. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Let's try a metaphor. The social situation in
    respect to consciousness-expanding drugs is very similar to
    that faced sixty years ago by those crackpot visionaries who
    were playing around with the horseless carriage. Of course,
    the automobile is external child's play compared to the
    unleashing of cortical energy, but the social dilemma is
    similar.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (It was this particular passage which finally
convinced the Harvard hierarchy that Professor Leary was now
obviously suffering from <i>real</i> hallucinations and that he
had to go!) </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The claim was made in 1900 that the motor carriage,
    accelerated to speeds several times that of the horse-drawn
    vehicle, would revolutionise society. Impossible to
    conceptualise because in 1900 we possessed no concepts for
    these possibilities. But we always have the standard
    objections to the non-conceptual. First of all, we object to
    the dangers: high speeds will snap nervous minds, gas fumes
    are fatal, the noise will prevent cows from giving milk,
    horses will run away, criminals will exploit the automobile. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Then the puritanical objection: people will
    use cars for pleasure, for kicks. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Then we question the utility: what can we do
    with speedy carriages ? There are no men to repair them.
    There are no roads, few bridges. There are no skilled
    operators. The supply of fuel is small. Who will sell you gas
    ? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Then we raise the problem of control: who
    should be allowed to own and operate these powerful and
    dangerous instruments ? Perhaps they should be restricted to
    the government elite, to the military, to the medical
    profession. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'But why do we want cars anyway ? What is wrong
    with the good old buggy ? What will happen to coachmen,
    blacksmiths, carriage-makers? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The automotive visionary of l900 could have
    pointed out that his sceptical opponent had no concepts, no
    social structures to implement these possibilities. Remember,
    if one talks about experiences and prospects for which the
    listener has no concepts, then he is defined (at best) as a
    mystic. Our automotive mystic sixty years ago would have
    asserted the need for a new language, new social forms, and
    would have predicted that our largest national industry would
    inevitably develop out of this vision. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Can you imagine a language without such words
    as convertible, tudor sedan, General Motors, U.A.W., Standard
    Oil, superhighway, parking ticket, traffic court? These most
    commonplace terms in our present culture were mystical images
    three generations ago. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The political issue involves control:
    automobile means that the free citizen moves <i>his</i> own
    car in external space. Internal automobile.
    Auto-administration The freedom and control of one's
    experiential machinery. Licensing will be necessary. You must
    be trained to operate. You must demonstrate your proficiency
    to handle consciousness-expanding drugs without danger to
    yourself or the public. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'A final hint to those who have ears to hear.
    The open cortex produces an ecstatic state. The nervous
    system operating free of learned abstraction is a completely
    adequate, completely efficient, ecstatic organ. To deny this
    is to rank man's learned tribal concepts above two billion
    years' endowment. An irreverent act. Trust your inherent
    machinery. Be entertained by the social game you play.
    Remember, man's natural state is ecstatic wonder, ecstatic
    intuition, ecstatic accurate movement. Don't settle for
    less.' (The Politics of Conscience Expansion', Harvard
    Review, Vol. I No. 4, Pages 33-37.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think Leary was most prophetic when he noted one
of the occupational hazards of the LSD game&#151;'You are more
likely to find the evolutionary agents closer to jail than the
professor's chair.' It is true, of course, that unlike more
traditional occupations, the LSD one is not one in which you
normally get smoother and smoother with experience, like a
doctor's: it is (to use Leary's metaphor of the automobile)
nearer to motor-racing, in that the changes are so rapid, the
curves so sudden, and demands an immediacy of response, a quality
of sheer nerve&#151;attributes not often maintained indefinitely
at top pitch. Perhaps it is all part of the pilgrim's progress
which, though undoubtedly preferable in many respects to the
poverty endured by Renoir and Pissaro, Blake and Artaud, is
likely to destroy more talents, in the end, than it nurtures. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And here again, we began to get echoes back from
different parts of the world, from people who seemed able to
identify with the message we were sending out. I still keep a
letter we received from Alfred Schmielewski Yogi, the Siddha Guru
from Canada, who had no doubts about the efficacy of
psychedelics: 'Psychedelic drugs,' he wrote, 'are the
breakthrough of the ages and represent an all-important
contribution to racial history. Here seems to exist after a
billion years of unconscious evolution an instrument that man can
use to establish control of racial unconsciousness. Man can now
say that the race can control itself, its unconscious processes.
This discovery will be the birth hour of the cosmic history of
the human species. With this instrument, man can conquer the
stars.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another related area, though not necessarily always
drug-related, was being developed brilliantly by Ronnie Laing,
M.D., in London, and Joseph Berke, M.D., in New York, namely, the
exploration of the experience of 'going-into-madness', with
madness being seen as 'a fundamental human experience rooted in
an untenable intrapsychic and interpersonal situation.' The
possibilities for madness as enlightenment could now be
discussed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Joe wrote to me about some of this, and said he was
trying to get a course together at FUNY (Free University of New
York) in which 'madness will be seen as a key to understanding
the entire panorama of &quot;psychopathology&quot;.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whilst it was possible for us to observe that the
drug research area was one composed of a wide range of <i>sub
rosa</i> activity, utopian dreams, mystical aspirations, and
ordinary vague enthusiasm, interpenetrated by a certain
atmosphere of personal life-renewal, we also believed that young
people, particularly intellectuals and artists, were looking
increasingly inward and back into their archetypical past,
turning, as it were, towards the inner life via the use of
mind-altering substances, just as in the thirties many young
intellectuals turned to the inner life via the church. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what sort of church? And what sort of a
religion could contain the 'LSD sacrament' ? Increasingly, it
seemed, the answers to these questions were coming from the East,
most particularly from Tibet, through the esoteric teachings of
the Great Mantra and spinning-top sound of the universe: OM MANI
PADME HUM. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We found that many of the visionary states
expressed in the Tibetan doctrines described states of
consciousness which compared favourably with induced visionary
states recorded by many of our religious-minded subjects. And in
the Mahayana Buddhist text <i>Bardo Thodol</i>, we found a most
accurate description of the 'going-out-of-the-body' experiences
as well as an entire symbology of 'ego-death' and 'rebirth'; it
was, after all, a Tibetan instruction manual for the preparation
of one's own death, the offices of afterlife, and instructions
for rebirth. We found these Tibetan images and thought patterns
conducive to flexible thought, and we began to discuss such
matters as incarnation, 'white light', death, without
embarrassment. Of this apparent unself-conscious use of
highly-charged, emotive, tabu words and worlds, Richard Alpert
once told a magazine reporter: 'Two years ago, if a guy came to
me, like they do now, talking funny, I would have thought he was
nuts. But what is a nut ? They're all on the same journey to the
East that we are. They may come as a guy with a beard and a
motorcycle or a Tibetan Lama. But we're in communication with
everyone asking questions: What does it mean to truly be ? What
is man's potential ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And of the <i>Bardo Thodol (The Tibetan Book of the
Dead),</i> Gerald Heard wrote that it provided a method: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'which can give us essential aid and guidance in and for
    the most vital and most neglected phase of our lives.... But
    however necessary it is that our American and, indeed, all
    our &quot;modernised&quot; societies be taught how to get
    over our death phobia and so to be freed from the ridiculous
    tabu-dishonesties whereby we attempt to disguise our rightful
    exit, we shall not try this method and undergo this training
    unless we can be reassured on two points, unless two quite
    sensible questions can be answered, two rational objections
    be met. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The first is: &quot;How can a Westerner accept
    the Buddhist, oriental, pessimistic, pre-modern,
    pre-scientific view of life: namely, that the best thing to
    do with it is to get rid of it?&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The second question runs: &quot;Granted, that
    out of the psychological methods developed by Buddhism a
    valid terminal therapy could be extracted, what use could
    that therapy be to any but the old ?&quot;' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In 1962, the youngest and most typical Westerner,
the American, was the most sincere of human beings. His
potentialities were unlimited, and in a world of growth they had
a right to existence. He was moving into a new age, a new culture
of sincerity; the harmony based on heteronomy of the adult
society was to become transformed into one based on autonomy,
when everyone could do his own thing and not be thought of as
either dangerous or crazy, and that all truth which was accepted
previously on the strength of authority would in future become
personal recognition through the development of personal
self-consciousness. If man is to stand on his own two feet,
autonomous, completely responsible for everything that he wills,
thinks and does, then he must be completely conscious of his
causes and reasons. He would have to develop a system of thought
that deals with true bondage in a true world, whilst at the same
time aim for the spiritual state of no-game, no-ego, the ultimate
liberation and the very highest forms of maturity. Only along
such a path can a new order develop, the OM-HUM of presence and
loving process. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After 150 years of fanatical exactitude in his
conquest of the world of appearances, Western man was starting to
discover that he could explore inwardness; though of significance
he knew little as yet. But having once perceived it as a
possibility at all, then he would use his ingenuity to find
perfect expression for it, and establish the perfect harmony
between essential being and the world of external phenomena. The
affective spiritual state was not to be found in the great
institutions of theology, which in fact no one inhabits, but
there, inside the self. He found in his confrontation with the
'Void', things which alone disclosed the nature of reality to
him. He was no longer a stranger to himself, a cipher lost on the
face of an inhuman universe, a puppet furnished with a name. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Excerpt from a post-session Report): </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'This was the deepest drug state. Things became confused
    as to time and sequence. I have almost no recall of what I
    was seeing at this time, and only feeling was important. I
    was seeing <i>something.</i> It seemed that when I cried a
    whole new world unfolded and the fascination with the figure
    was lost. I became part of a vast universe, drawing my energy
    from the earth. The order of things and in things became very
    clear. Love and hate were very important as I entered this
    state and seemed to be clawing at my back in order to gain
    control of the very core of me, a brilliant spinning core of
    energy. From here, probably as a result of being able to cry.
    I began contemplating the infinite sorrow of being alone. I
    felt, however, that infinite sorrow was the key to open the
    door of understanding, like washing the eyes so you could
    see. I felt if you could suffer an infinite amount of sorrow
    and be patient enough to wait an eternity, you could
    understand the meaning of things. However, for me in this
    state, finding the real meaning of the world no longer seemed
    important, but only being part of it myself, a dot in the
    cosmos, and feeling the complete harmony of everything, both
    inside and outside, and knowing that because there was such
    complete order I did not have to worry about myself. There
    was a sense of a lack of gravity and I was spinning, or
    rather spinning and floating at the same time around the
    earth, something like a satellite. I felt comfortable here in
    spite of the knowledge that from here I could not communicate
    with others because all people were One and a part of the
    vast energy of the world, as I was. Energy simply is; it
    exists but has no capacity or wish of communication; it has
    no way of communicating. Death of the body was not important
    here. It was a very wonderful feeling to be able to give my
    energy back to the earth where it had originally come from.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Clearly, after such an experience there could be no
return to a culture based on authority and blind surrender to a
regime where personal opinion is largely erroneous. Courage and
truthfulness, and they alone, accelerate the processes of
evolution. It is in the nature of things that even our mistakes
must turn into blessings, which presupposes a morality in the
universe somewhere. And any crudeness is largely due to our
sincerity. We do not know, as they do in Bengal, how to unite
externally metaphysical truth and telling lies, or, like the
Chinese, how to maintain outer face without breach of faith,
without even questioning to what extent it corresponds to inner
personal truths. Accordingly, loyalty to one's own private
beliefs and empirical truthfulness are among our highest ideals. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We had a lot of convincing testimony by people,
impressively intelligent where academic and worldly achievements
are concerned, which encouraged us to believe that in LSD we had
a new chemical tool for human expression and development. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although the comments and reflections are quite
diverse, we felt on the basis of our evidence that, in the
aggregate, the appeal is one in which humanistic values prevail.
So far from the LSD experience necessarily being the withdrawal
of the mind from reality, it brought it, for certain people, once
again into an enriched everyday life. And for some of us working
with LSD at Harvard during this time, we believed we had found a
means, on a manageable scale, with which our Western kind of
civilisation could be renewed by the discovery of new mysteries,
by the undemocratic but sovereign power of the human imagination,
by the undemocratic power which makes poets the unacknowledged
legislators of mankind, the power which makes all things new. We
could feel somehow that we were involved in nothing less than
'The Great Work of Magical Self-Liberation' of the Tibetan
doctrine when the eyes of the spirit would become one with the
eyes of the body, and God would be in us, not outside. <i>Entheos:
enthusiasm:</i> that was the essence of our 'unholy madness'. And
how far Harvard was from that ideal was the measure of the defeat
of the American Dream. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed the more we studied the reports, the more
we realised that no quick rational explanation would suffice to
cover the range of the emotional power of LSD on the human
psyche. Everything suggested LSD had a different meaning for
different people, a different meaning for different professions,
and even a different meaning for different social classes; people
seemed to take it to fill their own particular needs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The only intellectual danger, it seemed to me, was
a tendency on the part of many subjects afterwards to convert the
'inner world' they saw into a cosy fiction. Yet the moment of
illumination, the creative vision, the ecstatic encounter, the
experience of true insight, is essentially brief; once achieved
and expressed, one is again back on square one, a victim, like
everyone else, to the merciless vision of our sceptical
intelligence, or ambushed by stagnation <i>(stasis)</i> and
depression. I also had personal reservations about the claims
made on behalf of LSD that it was the <i>key</i> to the religious
or mystical state or could lead to a truer metaphysics of being.
In 1962, despite perhaps a hundred LSD sessions, I could still
say with Flaubert, that 'I am a mystic and I believe in nothing',
or echo the modern French existentialist, Coiran, who said that
'Once we have ceased linking our secret life to God, we can
ascend to ecstasies as affective as those of the mystics and
conquer this world without recourse to the beyond.' For there is
no evidence that LSD ever made nor marred a saint. Certainly,
'turning on' was interesting for its usefulness, for what it
could reveal in terms of a creative understanding to those who
used the psychedelic experience for their own purposes, and could
benefit from such knowledge. But real courage and a tremendous
sensitivity of mind is needed if one is going to hurl oneself
into a madness that is <i>not sacred,</i> since the <i>real</i>
temptation, it seemed to me, is to link the psychedelic
experience to God and prepare to return to that Garden of which,
through no fault of our own, we have lost even the memory. But if
reality still counts for something, then the psychedelic voyager
had to become a <i>practical dualist,</i> whatever be the
non-dual philosophical doctrines to which he intellectually
subscribes. It is true that at certain peak moments during an
intensive LSD session, it is only the <i>Clear Light of the Void</i>
that alone <i>Is.</i> One transcends at such moments the
dichotomy set up in one's mind between 'inner' and 'outer' worlds
of experience, and sees reality only from the standpoint of the
mystical vision, of the <i>Brahman</i>; and may experience life
beyond all dualism. But after such a trip, when the mountains are
again the mountains, and the lakes are again the lakes, there is
still the empirical world to be dealt with; it doesn't disappear
like the Cheshire Cat, leaving only an insane grin on your face. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very nature of the psychedelic experience makes
it capable of producing apparently impossible
effects&#151;hallucinations are things which are impossible,
which can yet somehow be felt as real. LSD exerts an influence
over consciousness by virtue of its proximity in the blood
stream, but there is nothing whatsoever <i>about</i> LSD; it
cannot exert volition on its own; indeed, there is a case for
saying it is itself unconcerned. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Consciousness responds to its influence. This is
analogous to what is called in chemistry catalytic action. The
catalytic substance influences another by its presence but
remains unaffected itself. LSD is in this sense an efficient but
not instrumental cause of heightened self-consciousness; but the
real powers of consciousness are <i>will, knowledge, action:</i>
these are the great triangle of energy, which is something known
to every Tantric yogin. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was an attempt by Leary, Alpert and Metzner
to start a new religion based on the psychedelic experience,
which found its theoretical expression in their authorship of <i>The
Psychedelic Experience</i>, a manual based on <i>The Tibetan Book
of the Dead.</i> They had adapted the classic work of Evans-Wentz
on the <i>Bardo</i> plane, according to Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup's
English rendering; but in such a way as to turn it into a
guidebook for psychedelic sessions. It contained technical
comments about: The Period of Ego loss (First Bardo): The Period
of Hallucinations (Second <i>Bardo</i>): The Period of Re-entry
(Third <i>Bardo</i>), following the Tibetan model. </p>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>'The first period (Chikhai Bardo)</i> is that of
    complete transcendence&#151;beyond words, beyond space-time,
    beyond self. There are no visions, no sense of self, no
    thoughts. There are only pure awareness and ecstatic freedom
    from all game (and biological) involvements ('games' here are
    behavioural sequences defined by roles, rules, rituals,
    goals, strategies, values, language, characteristic
    space-time locations and characteristic patterns of movement.
    Any behaviour not having these nine features is <i>non-game:</i>
    this includes physiological reflexes, spontaneous play, and
    transcendent awareness). <i>The second</i> (lengthy) <i>period</i>
    involves self, or external game reality <i>(Chonyid Bardo)</i>&#151;in
    sharp, exquisite clarity or in the form of hallucinations
    (karmic apparitions). <i>The final period (Sidpa Bardo)</i>
    involves the return to routine game reality and the self....
    For the unprepared, the heavy game players, those who
    anxiously cling to their egos, and for those who take the
    drug in a nonsupportive setting, the struggle to regain
    reality begins early and usually lasts to the end of their
    session.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In other words, its authors suggested that we die,
creatively speaking, when we cling too fast to the definite. But
if you cling too long to any idea, even to the idea of LSD as a
means of human transcendence, it can become a chain like any
other. There were times when I felt we had forged an 'LSD chain'
around all our necks; our problem was were we ever going to
remove it? The Tibetan idea of 'ego death' leading to 'conscious'
experiences in the after-world, with the possibilities inherent
in that situation of selective re-lives, was a very appealing
one, though it reminded me a little of the Irishman of 102, who,
on being asked the secret of his longevity, said that we should
'choose our parents very, very carefully'. It seemed that the
spirit generated in the generation of the early sixties was of a
certain hopefulness in the possibilities of <i>consciously</i>
making of their future something beautiful rather than brave. The
origins of the Movement are thus in the loving direction of
concord, better human understanding, and brotherly love. </p>

<p> <center>Brotherhood: each person<br>
owns nothing but the whole.</center> </p>

<p> might stand for our motto at that time. Sublime optimism or
sublime nonsense ? Who can really say for sure ? And for the rest
. . . let me just add the only man who managed to live without
money was Robinson Crusoe. Therefore, Practical Dualism Always!
ought to be the slogan of our new psychedelinquent youth
movement, I believe. </p>

<p> Soon enough, the summer came, the conjunction of my planets
suggested change. For a little rest and recuperation I went to
Jamaica, accompanied by my girl-friend, Karen, with whom I had
been living for most of my time in Massachusetts. Tim, Richard
Alpert, Ralph Metzner, George Litwin, and indeed the majority of
the other members of the Harvard Psychedelic Project, took off
for Mexico, more precisely, to coastal Zihuatanejo, there to
start an LSD colony along the lines outlined in Aldous Huxley's
book <i>Island</i>. It was history's first organised LSD youth
colony. And a report from George Dusheck appeared in the San
Francisco <i>News-Call Bulletin,</i> part of which I reproduce
now: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Dr. J. J. (Jack) Downing, a top San Mateo County
    psychiatrist and LSD experimenter, was among twenty Americans
    expelled from Zihautanejo by Mexican authorities June 16. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Dr. Downing himself has treated about forty alcoholics
    with the mindboggling drug at San Mateo County General
    Hospital, with &quot;hopeful&quot; results, as the <i>News-Call
    Bulletin</i> reported last January. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'He was not, however, a member of the International
    Federation for Internal Freedom, sponsors of the Zihuatanejo
    LSD colony. Dr. Downing was there, in his own words, &quot;as
    an observer and investigator of the group treatment
    situation.... &quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The colonists were sedate, professional people, he
    reported. &quot;There were no beatniks among them,&quot; he
    said. &quot;The majority of them were successful people, who
    seemed to have a religious or self-improvement motivation in
    being there.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>' &quot;Zihuatanejo is a middle-class Acapulco,&quot; said
    Dr. Downing. &quot;The very rich go to Acapulco, those
    moderately well off go up the coast . . . about 120 miles
    north . . . to Zihuatanejo.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'There Dr. Timothy Leary and Dr. Richard Alpert, both
    former Harvard psychologists, set up a Mexican branch of
    IFIF, headquartered in Boston. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The colonists, screened from thousands of applicants,
    paid $200 a month for food and lodging, lived in one of
    several bungalows above a beautiful white beach, dotted with
    palm trees and cabanas. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>' &quot;There was an open-air dining room,&quot; Dr.
    Downing observed. &quot;The funicular, a little railroad
    going down to the beach, didn't run, so we had to walk. There
    was lots of fresh fish, caught in the bay by Zihuatanejo
    fishermen. The staff was friendly and casual. The setting is
    lovely.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'There are four rooms to a bungalow, he said. One of these
    was set aside for group LSD sessions. Every morning two to
    five persons would gather in this room, with Hindu prints on
    the wall, and Hindu woven prints on two double mattresses and
    boxsprings on the floor. The LSD companions, including one
    member of the IFIF staff, would swallow liquid LSD and plunge
    into the dream world of visions, mind-expansion,
    self-awareness and mystical ecstasy. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The staff consisted of Dr. Leary, who was busy most of
    the time screening applications&#151;more than 5000 were
    received from all over North America&#151;and fending off the
    curious officials of the Mexican immigration service; Ralph
    Metzner, a pharmacologist, and his wife, Susan, twenty-two. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'One of these sat with the LSD group, taking the drug
    also, so as to be <i>simpatico.</i> Those who take LSD and
    &quot;sail&quot;, as the saying goes, believe that only users
    can understand those who are taking it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The dosage was heavy: 100 to 500 micrograms. More than
    300 micrograms is considered an overwhelming dose by most
    experienced pharmacologists and psychiatrists. There are
    twenty-two grams to an ounce, and a million micrograms to a
    gram. Thus, enough LSD to cover the head of a pin can send
    one off like an Atlas rocket. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'As the hours wore on, the group . . . possibly consisting
    of an actress, a magazine writer, an alcoholic businessman,
    and Mrs. Metzner . . . would exchange visions, cry out at
    sudden insights of omnipotence and glory, listen to a motley
    collection of records. Gradually, towards four or five
    o'clock in the afternoon, the effect of the drug would wear
    off, and the drug therapees would emerge one by one into the
    bright Mexican evening. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'For those not taking LSD, the day was relaxed and
    endless: Breakfast at 11.00 a.m., lunch at 3.00 p.m., dinner
    at 9.00 p.m. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>' &quot;The atmosphere was highly unusual,&quot; Dr.
    Downing reports. &quot;People accepted one another without
    suspicion or anxiety. They seemed very open, very
    relaxed.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Even when immigration officials, embarrassed by stories
    of the LSD Paradise in the Mexican press, moved in to close
    the IFIF colony on June 12, nobody was upset. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>' &quot;Dr. Leary was very calm. He went to Mexico City to
    seek a modification of the order, but when he failed, took
    defeat without bitterness,&quot; said Dr. Downing. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'They all left for Mexico City on Sunday, June 16, on a
    special DC-3 chartered by immigration officers. The
    Zihuatanejo experiment had begun on May 1. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>' &quot;Six weeks is too short a period to measure any
    results,&quot; said Dr. Downing. &quot;It must be regarded as
    a ruined experiment. My own view is that Leary and Alpert
    have developed techniques of potential value. But I do not
    agree with them that LSD should be available to all who want
    it. It is a potent, potentially dangerous drug, and should be
    used on an experimental basis only, by qualified professional
    researchers.&quot;' </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Meanwhile, back in Jamaica, life had become quite idyllic for
Karen and myself; we had rented a beach house at Seven Miles, in
the grounds of the Copacabana Club, a popular hang-out and
dancing place for people from Kingston. There was a garden ablaze
with flowers, and hanging-plants around a veranda, from which we
had a view over the ocean and of the Blue Mountains behind the
house. There was also a small pool for a swim after coming back
from surfing. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Karen and I swam, and dug our limbs in the sand,
made pilgrimages into the bush and to the tops of mountains,
lived very close to nature, with the sun continually warming both
body and mind. Already we began to yawn for the future of
mankind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But is it possible to get bored with a panorama
that is the same virtually every day ? It seemed to me after only
a couple of months of Jamaican weather, that the sky remained an
unvaried bright-clear blue and the sun a bright orange furnace
every day; and I began to yearn for the varieties of nature you
find in Europe. The pull of home was too great. I had to find a
means of returning, somehow. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, I wrote a letter to Eileen Garrett, a
friend, the President of the New York Parapsychology Foundation
and a celebrated medium, who was extremely wealthy. I suppose my
letter was in some sense a call for assistance, which she
responded to immediately by sending me a first-class air ticket
to Nice, and a cable to say that her chauffeur would pick me up
and take me to 'Le Piol', the headquarters of the Parapsychology
Foundation in France. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When I arrived at Nice airport a few days later I
was indeed met by a chauffeur and taken to what seemed to be a
four-star restaurant, just outside St. Paul-de-Vence. But I was
quickly reassured by seeing Mrs. Garrett, who welcomed me and
explained that she had built the restaurant herself, 'to pay the
bills', and there were a number of chalets in the grounds for
guests of her Foundation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After several days there, during which I met a
number of very interesting people, including the Professor of
Psychiatry at Edinburgh University, George Carstairs, who had
written a monograph earlier on <i>Daru</i> (a potent distilled
alcohol derived from the flowers of the mahwa tree) and <i>Bhang</i>
(the Indian name for <i>Cannabis indica</i>) as a 'choice of
intoxicant' in a village in Rajasthan. We also discussed other
names in both India and elsewhere by which Cannabis is
known&#151;<i>bhang, charas, ganja, kif, takrouri, kabak,
hashish-el-k if, djoma , dagga, Samba, grifta, marijuana, pot,</i>
and even the American name&#151;<i>shit.</i> But, alas, he was
not holding at the time, which ever name you called it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, the outcome of my stay at 'Le-Piol' was
that Mrs. Garrett gave me a foundation cheque in the amount of
$3000 to write a report on the Harvard-Concord Prison Project,
which interested her. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was thus able to return to London, cable a ticket
for Karen in Jamaica; as it also enabled us to spend a very
pleasant autumn in a basement flat in Brompton Square. I did
manage to complete the prison paper and sent it off to New York;
my only acknowledgement was from the secretary of the
Parapsychology Foundation, who replied saying that my monograph
read as 'if it had come out of an &quot;atomiser&quot;'; and was
a 'literary work' by which, as a scientist, the secretary was not
much impressed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After a few months, with the grant money nearly
spent, Karen and I decided to return to America, this time to New
York, with plans for setting up a 'foundation for mind research'
called The Agora Scientific Trust Inc., where the 'Agora' in
Greek times was a market-place, only in this case it was a
'market-place' for ideas about the nature of human consciousness.

<h4>CHAPTER FOUR</h4>

<h3>THE EXILE'S RE-RETURN</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<h4>1963</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Once more I wandered through the gigantic city of
New York, and the busy arteries of Manhattan and its mighty
Central Park. It was January. And it felt good to be back. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had had quite a few new ideas since leaving
Harvard about extending the availability of LSD to new groups,
organisations, and selected individuals, which might lead to
locating space for the psychedelic experience in modern American
society. It was clear that if psychedelics were to enter into
proper competition for society's mandate, we would need some kind
of structure to disseminate our new knowledge. The need for a
legal framework into which psychedelics could be smoothly fitted
was very great indeed, for non-medical use of these drugs,
including LSD, was <i>not</i> yet governed by the Food and Drug
Act&#151;and if we were to use our legal advantages in a
collaborative way, and fast, we might be able to get a project
off the ground and circulating through inner space before the law
finally got round to outlawing their use or amended the Act to
prevent their use for religious purposes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An American legal authority, Roy C. Bates, writing
about 'Psychedelics and the Law'&#151;what he called 'A Prelude
in Question Marks'&#151;comments on the situation of about this
time, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'It may seem far-fetched but would be altogether in accord
    with the (Federal) Constitution to organise a group as a
    church, with the prospect of privilege.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And he based this observation on a decision by the
Honourable Yale McFate in 1960 in favour of a member of the
Navajo Indian Tribe appealing a charge of illegal possession of
peyote, a sacramental food of the Native American Church. There
was also another Navajo-peyote case on the books: it was decided
on July 26, 1962, by the United States District Court of Appeals,
District of Columbia Circuit (Washington), to declare a section
of the Code of Indian Tribal Offences&#151;'Peyote Violations'
'null and void, invalidly authorised and unconstitutional'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As to such religious practices, William Blake (b.
1757) has this to say: 'I then asked Ezekiel why he ate dung, and
lay so long on his right side and left side. He answered, 'The
desire of raising other men into a perception of the infinite;
this the North American tribes' practice.' <i>(The Marriage of
Heaven and Hell).</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bates also noted that </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Inner space law today (1963) is in the stage of
    underdevelopment outer space law was in A.D. 1903 when the
    Brothers Wright launched their airplane at Kittyhawk or,
    perhaps, when the Brothers Montgolfier ascended in the first
    air balloon, a hundred years earlier. Until it has matured,
    scholars in search of external on behalf of internal freedom
    will feel frustrated. They may believe themselves to be
    fugitives from injustice but in truth are victims of legal
    confusion engendered by the reversal of scientific objects,
    from the universe without to the universe within. Until
    psychedelics have found their place in law, a good many
    concrete questions will not be answerable with confidence.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim Leary had also taken note of the legal
uncertainty surrounding the use of psychedelic substances, and
working independently in Cambridge, Mass., started a unique
organization called 'IFIF' (International Federation for Internal
Freedom) to preach the gospel that man's salvation lies in the
expansion of his own consciousness&#151;that the fruits, which
hitherto have fallen only to the lot of him who renounces the
world, can now be shared by him who partakes of the LSD
sacrament, and that, no matter how little happiness can be
regarded as the goal of individual human aspiration, it is yet
the best means to its attainment. They sited the IF-IF offices on
Storey Street&#151;two blocks from Harvard Square. 'We welcome
anyone interested,' Alpert wrote in <i>The Harvard Crimson.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While Alpert continued to conduct his course in
motivation at Harvard for undergraduates and graduates, and Leary
taught his graduate seminars in research methods, IF-IF staff
took care of enquiries, official correspondence, and mailing
packets of literature to Harvard undergraduates, graduate
students, faculty and anyone interested anywhere in the country.
There was an application blank for membership in IF-IF (dues $10
per year), an 'Agreement to Indemnify and Hold Harmless'. </p>

<p><center> AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS</center></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For good and valuable consideration, including
access to the literature and other facilities of the
INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INTERNAL FREEDOM, its agents,
servants, associates and employees, I agree to indemnify the said
INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INTERNAL FREEDOM, its agents,
servants, associates and employees, and save them harmless for
any loss, damage or expenses arising from the claim and demand of
any person against the INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INTERNAL
FREEDOM, its agents, servants, associates or employees, in
connection with the use of LSD, psilocybin and related drugs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have read the information concerning these drugs
and substances and understand that they are classified for
investigational use. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; DATE: ........................&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .............................. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; WITNESS: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; .................................... </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And messages from the Cambridge headquarters
began to move along the system, telling the news, of odd
happenings in Mexico, how 'Internal Freedom' is going to be like
Zen this year, and of 'several million thoughtful people who have
heard the joyous tidings and who are waiting patiently for their
psychedelic moment to come', for whom LSD is becoming a major
religious and civil rights controversy. It was a brilliant
astonishing concept, even by eccentric New England standards, and
deserved all the support it could get; indeed, it seemed for some
of its membership to offer the umbrella under which they could
enjoy their psychedelic experiences without much spiritual or
financial outlay. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But even in the hands of Tim, the eternal juggler,
things began crashing about their heads as 'news' about IF-IF
circulated in the media and through casual gossip, which may or
may not have been true but was certainly extravagant,
contradictory, scandalous, libelous, comic and inspirational. An
IF-IF-Los Angeles opened for the West Coast. Alpert and Leary
went on radio in Boston to explain their mission. Television
networks were becoming interested, and 'experimental
multifamilial living' using psychedelics began to spring up in
different parts of America, along the lines of Tim's model for
'transpersonative, transcendental communities' where family
members could 'maintain a level of experience which cuts beyond
routine ego and social games'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alpert, Tim and his young daughter and son, a
married Harvard senior with wife and baby, and several friends
had themselves already started one such multi-familial dwelling,
in a house they bought in the Newton suburb of Boston. In it
there was a specially constructed 'meditation room' accessible
from the cellar solely by a rope ladder. The only furnishings
were mattresses covered in Indian prints, with drapes billowing
down from the ceiling like Tibetan clouds, and huge Afghani
cushions on the floor. A tiny oil-lamp gave just enough
illumination to see the Buddha statue in the corner. The
fragrance of incense completed the effect. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in the rich middle-class Boston dovecote of
Newton, the goings-on at the house had become a source of
irritation amongst neighbours, including one lady who had lived
for thirty-two years in a house near Dr. Alpert's green
ten-bedroom home. 'Some weekends,' she complained to one
reporter, 'their house is like a motel. They all wear a beatnik
uniform&#151;tight pants and jerseys, no shoes or stockings. One
young man in his twenties is letting his blond hair grow down to
his shoulders and every time I look at him I want to vomit.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally the families got together for a petition
and invoked a Newton statute which allows only one-family
dwellings in the neighbourhood. There was a hearing before the
planning board in which the colonists were represented by
Alpert's father, George Alpert, former president of the New Haven
Railroad and a distinguished member of the Massachusetts bar,
with his own law firm in Boston. The elder Alpert pointed out
that the law does not specify that families must be
consanguiness. And with that he won the case; there was no
further trouble from neighbours after that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nonetheless, all this, and events back at the IF-IF
offices, used up a lot of psychic energy in those of us committed
to keep the game going. It seemed that the best plan would be to
dissolve the corporate legal structure and announce that from
henceforth IFIF members could make their own way in the
world&#151;just their bodies and a willingness to stay 'on the
way', very much as in Hermann Hesse's <i>The Journey to the East.</i>
Accordingly, the organisation's board met to formulate the
closing-up operation and to send its members the terminating
Statement of Purposes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was all played as another conscious move in the
cosmic 'bead-game'&#151;Remove the old 'set' and <i>avoid</i>
setting up a new structure, and you have a brand new movie:
'IF-IF will have no members, no budget, no dues, no officers, no
meetings. It is now an anonymous system; not secret, not public,
but private. The term &quot;IF-IF&quot; no longer stands for
International Federation for Internal Freedom. It symbolises the
&quot;ecstatic process&quot; as the endpoint of any game or as a
point of the no-game experience.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The basic notion was to aim at some loose
association in being identified as 'wayfarers', but without any
kind of specific structure anymore, a 'move' that guaranteed both
end and start in one. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was absolutely unique. Once understood, all
manner of varieties and variations could be introduced....
Everybody has to find the way for himself, but can send messages
and cues from his own voyage, like internal cosmographers
charting new internal seas of experience and perhaps pointing out
sensory landmarks yet no prescription, no rigid principles, for
action. Total Autonomy Always . . . Just a message here and
there, or a particular quotation or a description of an
experience or exposure of getting stuck in a particular game, all
with the general purpose of raising the general tenor of people's
lives with the ultimate goal that of complete self-liberation. In
the lines immortalised by Bobby Dylan on the 'Lay Lady Lay' track
of <i>Nashville Skyline</i>&#151;'You can have your cake and eat
it too.' Yeah ! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The new IF-IF offered entry into a psychedelic
paradise of delights with the price of admission only your own
head. IF-IF was now free to develop its religious aspirations in
the direction of the most ideally minded&#151;the great American
youth, by suggesting people who take psychedelics are destined to
give that spiritual content to modern life. IF-IF was a church
you associated with bringing you up, not down; the new religion
was something associated with getting high. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One professor of psychology was very enthusiastic
to propose new techniques and complex in-field play: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Perhaps one could start with or on the IF-IF members as
    the natural audience and introduce the notion through the
    news letter, then encourage everybody to send in a
    return-addressed and stamped envelope. This would reduce the
    cost. Also send out all material in duplicate, with the
    instruction to give one copy to an interested friend. That
    would snowball the development. Also, initially perhaps the
    comic Zen koans ought to be relatively simple yet not too
    easy. Something in the nature of different languages,
    references to significant passages or books, or records, or
    anything. It is important to get people involved through
    action, they have to work to solve the koans. Then, gradually
    . . . one could make it more difficult, and more in
    &quot;code&quot;&#151;you could circulate original
    &quot;manifestos&quot; analysing possible game hang-ups and
    traps in society; and you can build up a body of references
    one can allude to. Then make it gradually more difficult to
    obtain information, so that one would have to go through
    several persons and piece things together. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'To meditate on a type of koan is a great idea.
    Set up a master file to collate correspondence, but keep
    everything cosmically anonymous. A lot of disguising and
    metamorphosis, using code names, etc. The whole thing ought
    to lead to a spiritual revolution in which everybody works
    for his own enlightenment, which will come to him in his own
    way through his own effort, carried by the feeling of
    participation in a brotherhood, yet without legislation and
    direct advice or feeding, which necessarily leads to control.
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'All this seems like a natural evolution from
    IF-IF that utilised accepted social games for its dialogue or
    &quot;duel&quot; with established social structures. But the
    previous effort is not the way to fight it. In doing so, we
    submit implicitly to their rules. We have to find new rules
    which transcend the old ones without direct conflict, but we
    have to play on our own terms and have the others adjust to
    finding out what we are up to. Not that we really have to
    know&#151;as a matter of fact we can't know, because the idea
    is to keep everything in flux and go beyond the structures as
    soon as they are built and have been used once. Transcending
    is being elusive but in a marvelous sense. (Socratic irony.)
    If we state fixed goals&#151;other than personal, unique
    enlightenment&#151;we set ourselves up for being attached,
    shot at. The secret is that &quot;the way itself&quot; or
    &quot;being on the way&quot;, is its own goal, which means
    you have to keep changing as you go along. Only the
    here-and-now counts&#151;the here-and-now which is anyway
    pregnant with future and past (although it is wrong to <i>worry</i>
    about that). Complete responsive surrender to the challenge
    of the moment is equal to complete transcendence. Following
    the call and tuning in on the demands that present
    themselves; reading the signs of the way through the jungle;
    being in tune with nature and responding to it, rather than
    trying to redo everything in one's own image; trying to
    impose one's own game on to things, people, events: only this
    leads to liberation, I think. So every event, every
    manifestation of being, stands on its own terms and wants to
    be understood as such. One can only serve as the guardian of
    being, as the custodian of phenomena, to let oneself be swept
    up and carried away. There need be no questions asked:
    affirmation and acceptance ! <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'But people are phobic about
    &quot;drugs&quot;&#151;a strange phenomenon unto
    itself&#151;and they rationalise about &quot;artificial&quot;
    and &quot;short-cuts&quot;, etc. If we could use gimmicks and
    natural disciplines like sensory isolation, movie techniques,
    and explore other techniques, meditation, what have you, in
    order to effect some kind of loosening up and ecstatic sweep
    or upsurge&#151;then it would be easy to convince people
    about the value of &quot;shortcuts&quot;. This effort would
    allay their fear. Not that we need to worry about convincing
    people, but to point out to them various possibilities for
    them to consider. All arguing about pros and cons seems
    futile. One should report on events, give messages about
    where we are, what we see, what there is to behold.
    Persuasion is not needed, but affirmation and signposts,
    which manifest their own persuasive power on those who are
    interested. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I also hope we can write and tape a few
    programmed Perhaps one could interest a record company in
    cutting a few discs and distributing them. The communications
    network could be a powerful influence on tastes. The
    meditation-room idea is gaining wide recognition
    here&#151;everybody should build one. There will be
    tremendous need for meditation guides as well as manuals for
    trips. All this is very exciting and I hope we can talk about
    it soon. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'There is a &quot;magic theatre&quot; wherever
    you look, if you can only relax and forget about yourself as
    an actor caught in a net struggling to get out. Total
    involvement and total detachment at the same time, which
    sounds paradoxical but it seems a desirable and realisable
    ideal, the 100 per centness, here and now, which makes every
    moment (even of deadliest routine) seem like a totally new
    experience merely by letting yourself be addressed each time
    anew.' </p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Doctor Strangelove, indeed . . . But it was left to
the Grand Master and High Priest Tim, to explain how, in future,
messages (verbal and non-verbal) were to be found in the seed
that lies at the core of each one of us. He wrapped it up in his
own esoteric way&#151;'IF-I F is conservative&#151;it seeks to
return to the wisdom of the tribe, to the wisdom of the body, to
the wisdom of the nervous system.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was all perhaps just a problem of 'unicornity',
for Hermann Hesse had written of the pilgrimage: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Throughout the centuries it had been on the way, towards
    the light and wonder, and each member, each group, indeed our
    whole host and its great pilgrimage, was only a wave in the
    eternal stream of human beings, of the eternal strivings of
    the human spirit towards the East, towards Home. The
    knowledge passed through my mind like a ray of light and
    immediately reminded me of the phrase which I had learned
    during my novitiate year, which always pleased me immensely
    without my realising its full significance. It was a phrase
    by the poet Novalis, &quot;Where are we really going? Always
    home!&quot; ' (The <i>Journey to the East</i>). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in a practical way, IF-IF&#151;if, IF!&#151;had
anticipated Marshall McLuhan's theoretical basis for what
lysergised nervous systems believe about non-verbal, i.e.
telepathic, communication: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Tribal man is tightly sealed in an integral collective
    awareness that transcends conventional boundaries of time and
    space. As such, the new society will be one mythic
    integration, a resonating world akin to the old tribal echo
    chamber where magic will live again: a world of ESP....
    Electricity makes possible&#151;and not in the distant
    future, either&#151;an amplification of human consciousness
    on a world scale, without any verbalisation at all.' (<i>Playboy</i>
    interview). </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Something similar happened to us in New York, where
a parallel development was simultaneously taking place at the
offices of The Agora Scientific Trust, Inc., on the corner of
Eighty-First Street between Madison and Park Avenues. It was only
in New York City the game possibilities were different, that's
all; it required a different scenario, new players, a fresh
response to the organisation possibilities inherent in our new
situation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Agora was to be a living metaphor for the kind of
idea-sharing an LSD session entails. In our 'Statement of
Purposes' a group of us introduced a theoretical model for Agora
as a Foundation for Mind Research, and wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'In the seventeenth century Rene Descartes advanced the
    theory that the body is a machine and is subject to the same
    investigational techniques that we apply to the natural
    sciences. In contrast, he considered the human mind to be of
    immaterial and supernatural design, linked to the body by
    means of some unknown divine fiat. The ramifications of
    Cartesian dualism were to provide all areas of Western
    science with the result that today the body is accorded
    extensive study and scientific analysis whereas those aspects
    of human life which are identified with the mind have been
    greatly neglected by experimental scientists. The tremendous
    advances of modern biology and medicine are the direct
    products of the great progress made in the knowledge of the
    body-machine which have resulted from the mechanistic
    procedures initiated by Descartes. On the other hand, these
    same procedures have had a debilitating effect on the study
    of the phenomenon of consciousness thereby seriously
    curtailing the studies related to the problem of life. Since
    biologists tend to extend the machine paradigm to living
    organisms, they neglect the phenomena not found in machines.
    Qualitative change is needed in the pattern of our studies if
    we are to discern an enlarged meaning of nature and of man
    extending beyond mathematical and experimental analysis of
    sensory phenomena and human behaviour. We believe, finally,
    that man has reached a crisis in consciousness within which
    he has the choice to continue in the path of the growing
    technicisation of human nature or to enter upon an intensive
    and comprehensive investigation of mind and its creative
    process in the pursuit of a greater use of human potential
    and a deeper understanding of the nature of reality. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In recent years, there have arisen groups of
    social scientists and psychologists who have striven to fill
    the existing vacuum in the study of consciousness. Guided by
    the successes of the natural scientists they have applied
    mechanistic attitudes to the study of mind and have sought to
    understand their subject in terms of behavioural controls and
    biological-drive modalities. In so doing, they have carried
    the theory of body-mind dualism to its logical and dangerous
    conclusion so that today we are faced with a growing tyranny
    of behaviouristic and mechanistic procedures applied to the
    exploration of human potentiality. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'We are a group of scientists and researchers
    who wish to move beyond our own scientific tyranny. We have
    ceased to be intoxicated with technological proficiency. We
    cannot endorse a mechanistic interpretation of human
    behaviour that reduces the mind-brain problem to a
    materialistic monism. We believe that the current
    over-emphasis on mechanism has produced a dislocation of
    vision, one that is resulting in a de-humanisation of
    knowledge and a de-humanisation of man. We believe that an
    investigation into the nature and potential of mind, a
    dynamic consideration of the range and chemistry of
    consciousness, the utilisation and evaluation of new and old
    techniques of intensifying and extending the mind's
    apprehension of its reality&#151;this is the substance of the
    research programme that is the Foundation for Mind Research.'
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to myself, there were two other
directors, John Beresford, M.D. (a long-term friend from the old
London days of the fifties, who now lived in New York), and Jean
Houston, Ph.D., a young, beautiful woman with two Off-Broadway
acting awards and an impressive list of academic involvements and
interests (Instructor in Comparative Religion and Philosophy of
Religion, Columbia University; Instructor in Philosophy, Hunter
College; Associate Professor in Philosophy and Religion, The New
School for Social Research; author of <i>The Varieties of
Religious Experience: A Re-evaluation of the James Work in the
Light of Modern Psychological Theory,</i> and <i>Tragedy In an
Age of Scepticism</i>&#151;and was later to co-author with Bob
Masters <i>The Varieties of the Psychedelic Experience,</i> a
work based largely on her experiments at Agora, where she was
guide to many intensive LSD sessions). And to help and advise us,
we gathered an impressive group of active 'research affiliates',
including Victor Lownes as our 'Tantric' consultant, a position
he filled&#151;or fulfilled admirably. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The set-up on Eighty-First Street was tasteful,
cosy, well-equipped, and expensive; we rented the floor-through
garden apartment in a private building with three rooms, toilet
and bath, and a tiny tree-shaded garden at the back. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By chance or by good fortune&#151;or it may even
have been by magic&#151;we had discovered in Howard Teague, the
Nassau millionaire, that rarest of cultural beings, the patron.
He had understood our needs and made the acquisition of the
property and furnishings possible, in a very open and generous
way. All we had to do in return was keep in touch and maybe visit
him in Nassau now and again. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The large centre room fronting the garden was our
'session-room'. No interior decorator ever devised this
psychedelic paradise of Swedish six-inch pile rugs and huge,
canvas 'mandalas' on ceiling and walls, but once inside you
dissolved all normal barriers of consciousness and flowed off
into the well of infinity. We had been on a spending spree during
the first few hectic days of getting the place ready&#151;a hi-fi
sound system with tape-deck and two speakers; a stroboscope; a
machine for emitting sub-audible (low-frequency) sound waves; and
a 'synchrotron', a device which delivers sound to the right and
left ears alternately. This room was also my bedroom <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The front 'office' had a couple of desks,
telephones, chairs, electric typewriters, small bar and cabinet,
a miniature FBI-type wire recorder, things like that, but was
nonetheless decorated in the conventional Manhattan office style,
without anyone ever actually using it, except possibly as a place
to smoke dope (very illegal in those days!) if there were
otherwise straight subjects undergoing a session in the other
rooms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At first, most of the planning and programming was
shared by Jean Houston and myself, each with our own little slot
to fill or speciality to develop. Jean was curious about what she
called 'Phylogenetic recall', the proposition by Jung that
in-built in the psychology of modern man there exist archetypes
related to the early history of the human race. She was
interested in setting up drug-related experimental designs and a
foolproof methodology of administration of long-term and
short-term psychedelics, most particularly the administration of
LSD-25, psilocybin, Dimethyl- and Diethyl-tryptamine, which we
had at the office in large supply; and, for myself, the question
of my role in Agora is a bit academic since I was both artist and
spectator at one with it and myself at the same time, though I
remember I used to write memoranda quite a lot and papers,
doubtlessly altogether quite meaningless, with titles such as
'Multicentricity and Incongruity; Epistemological Significance of
Recent Findings in Research Using LSD-25' and 'Experiments in
Thought Acceleration using Psilocybin' and 'The Nature of the
Subjective LSD Experience', all of which was, admittedly, pretty
didactic stuff compared to IF-IF, but nonetheless rather funny
and inspired for all that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In our psychedelic yellowstone we had found food
for both the lion (science) and the unicorn (fantasy/myth/magic),
even if in the end we could not persuade them, for all the
correctness of our opinions, to lie down together. What we had
tried to do was to blend new concepts and theoretical
frameworks&#151;utilising such diverse areas as the geometry and
energy dynamics of molecular 'flowing' structure to biochemistry,
genetics, vision, memory, and accelerated learning: Yes, ethical
and moral practice, too&#151;with all the magical arts, including
the 'I Ching', 'Quabhalla', The Tarot pack, and Alchemy, in order
to shed new light on what webelieved was a crisis in the 'Order'
and 'Symbolisation' in Western civilisation. I suppose you could
say that our orientation was humanistic. Our 'humane science'
aimed towards a simultaneous description of Man from multiple
points of view, which itself is nothing more than the
multidisciplinary understanding of the way mind and matter work
in man. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Julian Huxley, from London, wrote, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'In the psychedelic drugs we have a remarkable opportunity
    for interesting research. Nobody else, so far as I know, has
    done any work on different types of psychologically healthy
    and normal people&#151;people of high or low IQ, of different
    backgrounds, of different affective dispositions, on
    verbalisers and visualisers. This would be of extraordinary
    interest: we might find out not merely how to utilise our
    mind more energetically and more dynamically, but how to
    promote creativity by enhancing the creative imagination.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But as a research area, the psychedelic experience
was baffling for most researchers, whose speciality was
'compartmentalized' and who could not visualise the possibility
of a 'whole', when perhaps even a new branch of knowledge would
have to be developed to embrace new claims, concepts, as happened
in mathematics with the discoveries of quantum mechanics and
relativity theories, which revolutionized our understanding of
the forces at work in the external world but which have yet to be
integrated into a unified field theory of modern conceptual
knowledge. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In modern America in 1963, the available literature
looked more frightful than fruitful. Perhaps understandably, the
revolutionary impact of psychedelics was not recognised during
the early period of research. Occasional glimpses were found, but
the majority of reports suggest that the researchers describing
their results were seriously biased by their existing frames of
reference. A carry-over of former conceptual systems into the
radically new experience provided by these drugs inevitably
caused distortions in interpretation of the material covered.
Thus, while the work of the British psychiatrist, Dr. Humphrey
Osmond, concerning the biochemical nature of schizophrenia was
furthered by the introduction of LSD <i>et al</i>. during the
mid-1950s, at the same time psychedelic theory itself was not
advanced. It was in fact restricted into a pre-existing mould by
the unconscious association that came to be made between
psychedelic drugs and mental illness, which subsequently proved
to be as erroneous as it was misleading. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However, even in restricted scientific research,
sometimes something could happen to provide a valuable
psychedelic programme. In the field of treatment of alcoholism,
for one, there were several studies showing a close to fifty per
cent (one in two) control rate following 'LSD therapy', a figure
which cannot be matched by any other therapeutic approach to this
problem, and successful beyond the wildest dreams of Alcoholics
Anonymous, to say nothing of conventional psychoanalysis, which
has a success rate of curing alcoholics of about one in every
hundred, which is nobody. Or on another part of the
investigational spectrum, Dr. R. A. Sandison, a Canadian
psychiatrist, has reported the emergence of archetypal material
during psychedelic sessions, lending weight to the hypotheses of
C. G. Jung. Then there were a number of 'naturalistic' studies
from different schools of thought, artistic and otherwise, as
well as all the Harvard reports when subjects reported states of
consciousness, variously described in terms of transcendental
experience, i.e. visionary, mind-manifesting,
consciousness-expanding. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, a lot of research had been done with
psychedelics, by comparison with perhaps every other important
area of research, the total volume was minute. At the same time,
it was also becoming increasingly evident that there were
deficiencies in the published work which existed, and, curiously,
there had been little if any advance during the previous two to
three years over projects well under way before the 1960s. For
example, a review of the position by the psychologists Terrill,
Savage and Jackson, published in November, 1962, but dating from
a round-table conference in January, 1960, is <i>not</i>
essentially different from reports published in 1954 and 1956.
There were grounds for believing that the main factor which
stimulated the widespread interest in psychedelics, which
characterized the period of the mid-1950s, was the belief that,
through their use, long-standing problems in psychiatry were
about to be settled; further, that with the abandoning of this
hope a general decline of interest became noticeable in
psychiatric circles. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were even disagreements between some of the
developing 'psychedelic theoreticians'. John Beresford, for one,
believed that what he called 'the Leary attitude' results from </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'a static, unidirectional, relatively fixed set of
    preconceptualisations of entity caused by and arising from
    deep psychological disturbances, displaced on to and hence
    &quot;derealising&quot; a potentially dangerous drug. The
    error stems fundamentally from passive-receptive tendencies
    on part of erstwhile principal investigators, causing
    passive, permissive attitude during the highly suggestible
    LSD-state, criminally neglecting to acquaint the subject with
    the essential knowledge, that he can always control whatever
    his mind is involved with, rendering the subject helpless,
    and at times, extremely fearful.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beresford was a proponent of the counter-theory
that the LSD experience is a bi-phasic phenomenon: You must act,
as well as feel; decide, as well as submit; allow out, as well as
in. He felt quite strongly that LSD provided the </p>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>'only</i> curative hope for the &quot;crisis of
    civilisation&quot; type of malfunctioning', and that 'the
    cure can be summed up in the one word
    &quot;integration&quot;; and that integration requires
    activation of both self and image store. Leary fails
    miserably because total resistlessness in the end saps
    strength, leaving character no room in which to grow or form.
    Partly out of diabolical &quot;Gnosticism&quot;, and partly
    no doubt due also to ignorance, some of Leary's group have
    flipped out, and sometimes for months at a time, in sessions
    conducted according to the Leary precepts.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beresford believed sincerely in the vast potential
of psychedelic drugs. 'With safe and intelligent handling (of
LSD),' he wrote, 'the following facts can be substantiated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1) There is <i>no</i> possibility of &quot;psychic
    accidents&quot;. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Standard psychotherapy can be reduced in
    duration from a matter of years to a matter of months, with
    long-lasting, if not permanent results. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 3) The degree of &quot;internal
    decision-making&quot; possible is very impressive. A new
    pattern of Gestalt formation, on a level never before thought
    possible outside of classical conversion reactions, is coming
    to light and should be explored. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 4) Knowledge is waiting for the asking
    concerning alterations of the human mind which were thought
    non-existent or merely freakish before new psychedelic drug
    techniques were elaborated. An extensive new area of
    knowledge of mind is waiting to be opened. It is folly to
    ignore this. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 5) It has been beyond all doubt, though perhaps
    beyond credibility, that thirty-five per cent decibel
    increases in hearing are obtained on minute doses of LSD;
    that intellectual procedure beyond the normal capacity are
    commonplace; that new potentials are brought into existence;
    the probability of a high incidence of thought transference
    between two individuals should be brought out into the open.
    Other equally important researches are waiting. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 6) The sensation-minded public press, and the
    providers of scandal, and the prevalent public fear of
    &quot;losing control&quot; through drugs combined to drive
    the most valuable chemical discovery of the century almost
    out of existence. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 7) No more essential publishing service could
    be rendered than to place before the public the unadorned
    scientific, historical and psychological analysis of the
    &quot;extraordinary history of LSD&quot;.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beresford wanted to keep the drug and the research
in proper perspective as tools of the scientifically trained as
specialist. But any tool can only be as good&#151;or as
bad&#151;as the competence of those who use it. Certainly, one
must not assign to LSD intellectual problems which defy our
present intellectual capacities. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jean Houston, on the other hand was interested in <i>advancing
the intellectual capabilities</i> of the modern American&#151;to
meet and solve the problems not of today or tomorrow&#151;but <i>the
day after tomorrow.</i> And by means of a process that you might
call travelling in the <i>'ANTECEDENT FUTURE'</i>&#151;that is
inducing the ego to scan the cognitive parts of the cortex in
order to develop the ability to bring into the present what is
already in the memory and retrieve 'forgotten' information which
is then integrated into the normal intellectual processes of
ordinary consciousness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jean was an intellectually brilliant thinker in her
own right, and, if such things still mean anything, it had been
discovered in a nationwide survey of the I.Q.s of American Ph.Ds,
that Jean's was the highest&#151;a little over the 200 mark', she
once told me, though there was never any question in my mind
about her obvious intellectual gifts, which were always adequate
to meet her function as an Agora director, our third and most
junior member. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As with Beresford and myself, she saw modern
culture strangled by a crisis of value correlative with a
breakdown of its traditional ontological structures. The
'eleventh hour condition' of humanity is that of 'the dark
woods'. We are lost in the woods&#133; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Alone, alone, about a dreadful wood<br>
    Of conscious evil runs a lost mankind,<br>
    Dreading to find its father lest it find<br>
    The good it has dreaded is not good;<br>
    Alone, alone about a dreadful wood&#133;' </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &#151;W. H. Auden </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The poignant theme of the dark wood emerges in the
life of the mind as a symbol of the chaos that must precede the
restoration of Order and the revitalisation of the human
condition. How then is it possible for modern man to extricate
himself from the 'dark woods' of his mind? Jean believed that in
psychedelic drugs we had a means to dispel the clouds of despair,
and spoke of the promise they held 'of Homecoming'; and of the
possibility </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'of guiding man past the dark woods of non-being, past
    deep shadows of aloneness to a world where no longer does man
    view himself as a creature separated and estranged from all
    other creatures but rather as a participant in a rich and
    fertile reality, a reality so interrelated and so full that
    it could only best be described as a dynamic continuum; the
    new reality that unfolds in the &quot;psychedelic
    experience&quot;. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The universe is not a collection of separate
    bits and pieces, divided in time and space, but is in reality
    the metaphysical &quot;One&quot;, wherein everything is tied
    up with everything else in a pattern which is absolute for
    the entire universe. The social hierarchy reflects the
    psychological hierarchy, the cosmology hierarchy, and the
    celestial hierarchy; only this reality is not displayed
    within a single action, but instead, in an abundance of
    actions in which the most diverse tonalities follow one
    another in quick succession. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'It is thus with the psychedelic experience.
    When the threshold of consciousness is crossed we are flooded
    with the kaleidoscopic vision of cultures, peoples, symbols,
    remnants of historical and pre-historical memory&#151;the
    veritable infinity of humanity which seeks to constitute our
    being. Like Dante in the dark forest we can easily get lost
    in the labyrinth of strange byways and unknown paths. (This
    is an all too frequent episode in the unguided psychedelic
    session.) It should be one of the chief duties of the session
    guide to lead the subject through the newly exposed terrain
    of cultures, histories, eras, and symbols to evoke these
    contents to lead finally to their interrelationship in the
    mind of the subject, much the same way as Virgil led Dante
    through the medieval hierarchical cosmogony so that its many
    parts became inherent in Dante the man. It should be one of
    the chief tasks of the guide to assume the role of Virgil in
    this psychedelically induced Divine Comedy and to indicate
    and select out of the dynamic continuum in which the subject
    is immersed some of the historical incident, cultural
    awareness and racial memory that seems to lie buried in the
    cortex.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jean believed that the reality of the existence of
archetypes had been confirmed and demonstrated in the LSD
session, which seemed to bring mythological and archetypal
structures into conscious awareness. Thus, the role of the
session guide is crucial if the subject is not to lose his way in
the woods. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The guide must steer a course of gradual intensification
    and enhancement of consciousness. The first suggestions must
    be simple and familiar, geared to focus the subject's
    attention on the heightening of colour and form perception of
    well-known objects. Pictures and flowers, music and natural
    objects&#151;these are the data of initial discovery and
    consciousness enhancement in the experiencing subject. It is
    only after several hours of helping the subject build up a
    familiarity with his extended reality that the guide may
    begin to prepare the subject for an exploration of
    transpersonal and phylogenic material.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Simple, in theory, perhaps, but what in praxis ?
Jean ran many LSD sessions at Agora, which she conducted along
the lines just adumbrated with some quite astonishing results.
She makes some observations on these sessions, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'In the course of my experimentation I have discovered
    that a most conducive mode of preparation for phylogenetic
    investigation is to be had by taking the subject through a
    &quot;Cook's Tour&quot; of world history. A variety of
    historical situations and occurrences are suggested in a
    sketchy manner. The subject, whose eyes are closed, is asked
    to describe the pictorial display of historic scenery and
    activity which now he &quot;sees&quot;. This he often does
    with a detail and amplification and frequently an accuracy
    which far exceeds his normal historical awareness. Whether or
    not this is owing to the activation of previously learned but
    long forgotten historical information or to a utilisation of
    as yet unknown processes of historical evocation cannot be
    answered at this time. Suffice it to say that the probability
    rests with the former theory and that the subject's
    heightened imagination adds to the vividness with which he
    responds to these suggestions. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The subject may be invited to walk along the
    Piraeus with Socrates, to witness a battle in the Thirty
    Years War, to participate in the bull-leaping at Knossos or
    to help in building the pyramid of Khufu. He may be asked to
    gaze over the shoulder of that Cro-Magnon man who painted the
    great bison in the cave at Altamira. He may join in the
    violent thrust westward of the troops of Gengis Khan. He may
    have a front row seat at the battle of Hastings or mingle
    among the courtiers at the court of Louis XIV. History is his
    prerogative and it may be explored as fact or fantasy. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In addition to the historical panorama, the
    guide may invite the subject to participate in a recapturing
    of the evolutionary sequences of life. In many cases the
    subject discards the spectator role which he had assumed for
    the historical tour and finds himself taken up into a seeming
    identification with the stages of the evolutionary process.
    Thus the guide can suggest that the subject <i>become</i>
    that primordial piece of protoplasm floating in an early
    ocean. (This is described as a very restful state.) Then,
    either through the promptings of the guide but more
    frequently through the subject's own initiative there may
    unfold a reliving of the evolutionary process from gill stage
    to man. This re-experience of phylogeny is possible because
    of our germ plasm. Our body contains (however small the bit)
    a part of that physically real primeval mud from which we
    grew, through orders, classes, phyla&#151;to what we are.
    Thus the physical reality of the evolutionary sequence of
    life may become available to our consciousness and we may
    select for it in the psychedelic state. The psychic system
    has an anatomical pre-history of millions of years as does
    the body. And just as the body today represents in each of
    its parts the phylogenetic process, and everywhere still
    shows traces of its earlier stages&#151;so can the same be
    said of the psyche. It is for this reason that the activated
    psyche can be called upon to remember states which to us seem
    to be unconscious. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I would suggest then that ages and attitudes
    of man that are long gone by still survive in the deeper
    unconscious layers of our mind. The spiritual heritage of
    archaic man (the ritual and mythology that once visibly
    guided his conscious life) has vanished to a large extent
    from the surface of the tangible and conscious realm, yet
    survives and remains ever present in the subterranean layers
    of the unconscious. It is part of our being that links us to
    a remote ancestry and constitutes our involuntary kinship
    with archaic man and with ancient civilisations and
    traditions. Depth psychologists have pointed to the
    universality of psychic processes and the continuity of
    psyche within the race. We may add to this the theory that
    the psyche contains all the contents of time&#151;extending
    backwards, across and through time; history being latently
    contained in each individual. It is my contention that the
    psychic depths and the time depths can be tested and explored
    through the medium of the guide in the psychedelic
    experiences. The theoretical foundation of such a statement
    is that the ingestion of psychedelic substances evokes an
    activation of deeply buried psychic contents and a bringing
    of them to the surface of consciousness through the selective
    use of phylogenetic suggestion. As electrodes applied to
    memory or sensory areas of the brain can stimulate vivid and
    realistic recall at the moment of contact, so can suggestion
    activate phylogenetic memory in the subject undergoing the
    psychedelic experience. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In the course of human history man has come to
    the discovery that he is a foreconsciousness that sees only a
    manifold, incoherent world. Gradually he has been able to
    order the incoherence of pre-history by perceiving natural
    laws, by making hypotheses, and by his technological advances
    beginning to apprehend basic common factors and linkages in
    what at first appeared as sheer chaos. Through mythological
    structures he was able to gain some measure of surety in an
    incoherent world. One step further and he was able to
    perceive himself as being largely lawmaker and inventor. And
    now through the agency of the new physics man has attained to
    a knowledge of the mathematical structure of all matter as
    being in reality not inert but an instrument of infinite
    potentialities from which one may draw what forces one will.
    The pursuit of truth is now in fact akin to the creation of
    beauty. Yet all this new extension of potentiality bears with
    it the threat of unparalleleddestruction. I maintain that the
    new physics can be nothing but a deadly danger unless to that
    knowledge is added that of a new history a parallel and
    balanced knowledge of ourselves brought back from the
    subterranean regions of our psyche&#151;our phylogenetic
    awareness.... Then and only then may we use the new knowledge
    of outer nature for life and not for death. Our new vision in
    physics whereby we see ourselves actually devising new
    natural laws and even creating life must be equated with a
    deeper insight of ourselves given by a new knowledge of the
    past. This may be done by restoring man to a dynamic
    communion with his own sundered psyche, with his old sense of
    community, and with the whole of life and the universe.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, Agora was not entirely free from the
crackpot element, in whom the doors of perception seemed, if not
permanently unhinged then certainly wide open. One correspondent
writing from Flamingo Marina, Miami Beach, told of his work with
'a magnetic machine which will hypnotise you and a second machine
which goes inside the brain by rays and removes that part of the
moral degeneracy involved'. And added 'The patient may be
slightly ill for a few days, but his tendencies to sin will be
gone.' I simply replied that we already had one to deal with the
libertine tendencies of our staff, and hoped that his fine work
in ' &quot;prophylactic phrenology&quot; would have wider
application, perhaps as an instrument of the church'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there was a complicated correspondence with an
American Air Force Major from Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas, who
wanted Agora to build a 'life-size' Moebius Strip for people to
climb in and walk around 'accompanied by the entire spectrum of
colour and music'. The object of the envisaged 'Strip' is </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'to evoke in the participant any synergic, intuitive or
    emotive process/product of which he may be capable. This is
    for the purpose of unlocking his particular iron curtain by
    working directly on his subconscious through symbols
    (including language), the energy spectrum (light and colour),
    form, and even motion and odours if feasible. The
    super-computer qualities of the mind, including an ageless
    universal memory core, above-time-space programme actions,
    and conscious read-outs makes the mind our greatest resource,
    yet our greatest enigma. It is easy for this mysterious
    &quot;black box&quot; to be fed with <i>sensual</i> inputs
    that turn out a disordered state of consciousness.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In both these examples, it is impossible to ignore
the high moral tone of the two inventors. On the other hand,
which of us would not settle, at whatever cost to our reason, for
a febrile and creative, rather than static way of life ? And the
fact that the light these two ideas throws is a murky one,
doesn't, after all, seem inappropriate to our present situation.
Indeed, you could say that they illuminate the stresses placed on
the modern psyche in its relationship with modern society. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet&#151;I was sensitive to the fact that much
of the stuff going on at The Agora Scientific Trust must sound
every bit as 'crackpot' as the two examples just noted. The
intellectualization of what we had and were doing was a
formidable task. We had to find a way to describe certain changed
or altered states of consciousness, which lie beyond all
rationalization and even beyond all power of words, in a
completely new way which would also be intelligible for other
people, <i>whether they'd taken LSD or not.</i> Thus, no area of
possible fruitful research was ever turned down which could be
organised on the basis of rational belief, and we decided to
structure into an existence an idea or a series of ideas which
were derived from peoples' experience with LSD. During the first
few months of activity our own 'internal' viewpoints were
projected on to the outer world with a content that was found to
be full of meaning for other people. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is an intuitive basis which precedes the
intellectual which provides us with something like a magic armour
with which during LSD sessions nothing ever goes wrong.
Objectively my initial intuitive behaviour during a session when
I have given a person LSD can be codified into a set of precepts
and illuminations which may collectively serve as starting-off
point for others who may want to consider the principles of what
it means to be an 'LSD guide'. The following are some facts and
ideas from our 1963 Agora days I have assembled&#151;they involve
the means by which the 'internal logic' of the LSD situation may
be realised in ordinary consciousness, with what assumptions one
proceeds, with what goals, and what are the determinants of the
goals, and what is the relationship of the knowledge gained
through the LSD experience to daily life and ordinary affairs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had by this time given LSD to some 300 people and
taken it myself about 100 times, and learned by making mistakes,
as was inevitable, that no prior frame of reference can do
anything but hinder. I 'knew' certain things I had no way of
telling before. The intuitive leap had become standardised. For
this reason perhaps it was inevitable that I would sooner or
later leave Agora, terminating one phase and starting another. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what sort of people did we give LSD to ? We had
hundreds of requests from people all over America who wanted to
take it, but the facilities on Eighty-First Street were lacking
for such a large-scale operation. Perhaps I could note four
sessions which can be accurately dated and leave it to the reader
to decide how far they are relevant. (1) An abstract painter, (2)
a Captain in the U.S. Navy Office of Naval Research, (3) a Yogi,
(4) a hedonist sceptic, a wealthy resident of Manhattan's
fashionable Beekman Place and of Gstaad, Switzerland. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (It should be understood that axiomatic to my
belief-fabric is that with LSD each person discovers, or gets,
what they want.) The abstract painter, in the course of the most
extraordinary visual experiences, in concrete and specific
detail, of a mythological residue of a pre-Hindu Indian religious
fantasy, discovered the identity of the image which had been
eluding him from his paintings. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Captain achieved extraordinary insight into a
problem of mathematical 'transformations' with which he had been
unsuccessfully grappling for the past five years. His work was in
artificial intelligence via computer design. During the LSD
session, he wrote to us afterwards. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'I suddenly realised that whenever I concentrated on a
    single form and brought it into focus, the situation was
    analogous to setting up a random set of sensor inputs and
    connecting these inputs via a fixed but randomly designed
    network to a series of nodes. I realised that recognition of
    any given pattern is dependent upon calling a halt in the
    normal flow of transformations; and, most importantly for my
    own work, the achievement of really useful automata would
    appear to depend on mechanism that can effectively monitor
    the products of a large number of transformations, select
    from them the important one for study, and the halting of the
    process long enough to classify the signal from the one
    transformation for purposes of pattern recognition.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Translated into ordinary English, the Captain was
trying to invent a 'seeing' machine as effective as the human
eye, for use in atomic submarines.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Yogi, a man who spent seven years before his
arrival in America (where he had become a successful Wall Street
stockbroker) studying yoga in a <i>dhoti</i> on the banks of the
Ganges, jumped from the eighth of the twelve yoga stages&#151;the
name eludes me, but that is as far as he had got&#151;to the
twelfth, called <i>Samadhi,</i> and the very highest form of
Bliss, wherein he achieved the state of total identification with
all of reality that made him&#151;momentarily&#151;God. The man
from Beekman Place for the first time in his life was appraised
of a higher, that is more embracing and inclusive, logic than the
one he had known hitherto. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In each of these four instances&#151;people widely
different in background, education, character, nationality and
physique&#151;it was nonetheless possible to abstract a basic,
simple set of philosophical understandings, which are valid
enough to permit anyone to integrate on a higher-than-usual level
of awareness without any danger of paranoia (the common defence
against chaos, and one which mitigates against anything of value
deriving from the LSD experience) or of anxiety. The talked-about
'hellish experience' is actually completely unnecessary,
avoidable and non-contributory, reflecting inadequate mental
'set' or physical 'setting' or technical knowledge on the part of
the guide or a mixture of all three. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was of course no scientific follow-up on
these four individuals, but it was possible to deduce certain
things when we saw them again a few months later. The painter had
entirely reoriented his method of painting and when I last saw
him, was working fast and productively (and his paintings do
still sell in New York). From the Naval Captain have come some
engineering hardware&#151;'resistor networks to accomplish types
of transformation to be included in patent disclosures being
processed by the Office of Naval Research, Washington under Navy
Case 29093'. The Yogi was found to be, I fear, bewailing the
ordinariness of not being God, but was&#151;and still
is&#151;making money nicely on the Exchange, while the
millionaire believed that he had undergone a complete change in
his beliefs about other people. He has not been heard from since.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was thus with the establishment of the New York
centre, plus a form of status stabilisation with Washington (via
the U.S. Navy, who intervened on our behalf with the Federal Drug
Agency by placing our work in a rosy, even golden, light which
resulted in a letting-up of investigative pressure on Agora by
the FDA), plus the sketching out of rational (or neo-rational)
methods of managing LSD sessions, that this New York phase ended.
An astonishing, fascinating period, filled with interest, and
with lots of humour at all times to prevent us from becoming
LSD's dupes. But it was only achieved by an enormous amount of
work fed by the energy from our emotional fires. At once the
impatient reminder comes, and it is true: Agora experiment was
achieved at the cost of 'real' emotional contacts with other
people, including, at times, ourselves. The emotional content of
my existence was reduced to a working absolute minimum (though it
was difficult to recognise this process as going on at the time;
only afterwards did one realise at what cost the work had been
achieved). Perhaps it was all an elaborate form of 'self-therapy'
during the tormenting time after the collapse of my marriage in
1960 and plans to reconciliate with my wife and the consequent
loss of my daughter which became formalised at the moment of my
'rearranging of priorities' <i>intellectual, rational/artistic
creative work = No. I; love, emotion pleasure, sanity = No. 2.</i>
I had reached the end of my emotional tether; I had been 'on the
way' before I took LSD, but the paving had given out, and there
were not even stones left to pave new intentions. The country
ahead was dark, impenetrable. I was alone at the mercy of my own
awful fluidity of self; a time indeed of that 'eleventh hour
condition' of which Jean Houston speaks&#151;an impossible hour
of the day which is not marked by the sort of clocks you see in
shops&#151;so I was never sure of the present or certain enough
to determine the content of my emotional future. It is the
temptation to withdraw from emotional involvements, perhaps even
to curl up inside and stay remote from even the slightest
continuity. But of course all things pass&#151;'an afternoon does
not last all day, nor a sunset all night'&#151;and by the end of
the year I began to realise that the pointer of my 'eleventh
hour' was turning and that 'deadened time' was gradually being
displaced by a palpable and love-centred present pushing to the
future. 'The world, like the big wheel in a deserted funfair,
spun slowly toward the final revolution.' (Roger McGough). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All I had really achieved at Agora was the
realisation that the sombre doctors, scientists, technicians
point only to the rigour of their own particular method. Ah ! but
to go without aid in search of truth; perhaps this is the
beginning of wisdom&#151;to proceed with the utmost determination
towards a forbidding future through a series of 'crisis' instants
in which you think you're about to slip over the edge into the
aweful Abyss of Elsewhere, but catch yourself just in time but by
not shrinking from the lightning and thunder, by hurling yourself
forward, unafraid of taking risks, in your struggle towards love,
consciousness, enlightenment, light and God. And thus the Way was
suddenly much smoother; I was over the hump of the year. And it
was in this way, out of such emotional despair, that I stumbled
out of my dark existential forest into the daylight honesty of
Millbrook . . . </p>

<h4>CHAPTER FIVE</h4>

<h3>THE MILLBROOK HAPPENINGS</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<h4>1964</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although the world of Millbrook may seem
nonsensical by rational standards to the outside world it was
merely another way of saying reason is not enough. We lived out a
myth which had not yet been integrated into our personalities.
Millbrook was itself the work of art, or a mirror, or simply
something going fast like a watch, some time. Like Kafka's
castle, it gave out messages into the ether in the form of one
high resonant sound which vibrated on the ears of the world as if
it were trying to penetrate beyond the barrier separating 'us'
from 'them'. We felt satisfied that our goals were every man's, a
projection of every man's private ambition. We sought for that
unitary state of divine harmony, an existence in which only the
sense of wonder remains and all fear gone. Here was a philosophy
of TO BECOME in which appear bits of Vedanta and bits of popular
pantheism, bits of the Tao and bits of the Ching. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the Fall of 1964 I arrived at Millbrook.
Leary and Alpert, who had proclaimed themselves the International
Foundation for Internal Freedom (IFIF), had had to leave
Zihuatanejo, Mexico, where they had set up a training centre for
people using LSD. They got back to New York and started looking
for an alternative base somewhere in the States. The solution to
their problem came in the form of a sixty-four-room mansion on a
2000-acre walled estate within two hours motoring distance of the
city. They had rented the estate from the young millionaire Billy
Hitchcock, at a nominal rent more or less&#151;$500 a month. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The mansion was empty when they and their tiny
followship arrived, but it was the ideal place for them to be; it
was secluded and spacious and not entirely lacking in antiquated
charm. It had been built in the 1890s to the rather bizarre
architectural specifications of the German-born gas-lamp magnate,
Charles F. Dieterich, who christened his country seat 'Daheim'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The spires and turrets pointing above the trees
into a clear open sky, 'Daheim' looked, at first glance, like the
creation of some neo-baroque American King Ludwig. In addition to
the main building, there was an out-building that consisted of a
downstairs bowling alley and a large fireplace room upstairs. It
was built in the style of a Bavarian chalet and had a little
verandah from which access to the roof was easy. There was also a
lodge house at the entrance to the estate, in which Maynard
Fergusson and his beautiful wife Flo lived with their children. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Millbrook was the headquarters of the Castalia
Foundation, so named after the intellectuals' colony in Hermann
Hesse's book <i>Das Glasperlenspiel</i> (The Glass Bead Game),
the last and finest novel by Hermann Hesse, the story of which is
set in the Alpine province of Kastalien around the year 2400. In
this emotionally chill utopian future, isolated from the mass of
population, the elite monastic Castalian Order displays its
intellectual mastery through the ritualised game of glass beads,
a game encompassing all human knowledge. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The pattern sings like crystal constellations, <br>
    And when we tell our beads, we serve the whole, <br>
    And cannot be dislodged or misdirected, <br>
    Held in the orbit of the Cosmic Soul.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim was greatly interested in the writings of
Hesse, but at this time, it was the glass bead game that held him
under its hermetic spell&#133; Joseph Knecht ('servant'), hero of
the novel, rises to be a Magister Ludi, the High Priest of the
Castalian Order. Gradually he becomes dissatisfied with the
exclusive and esoteric nature of those who play the game, for the
rules of the game had evolved into an astonishing complexity: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'These rules, the sign language and grammar of the Game,
    constitute a kind of highly developed secret language drawing
    upon several sciences and arts, but especially mathematics
    and music.... The Glass Bead Game is thus a mode of playing
    with the total contents and values of our culture.... All the
    insights, noble thoughts, and works of art that the human
    race has produced in its creative eras, all that subsequent
    periods of scholarly study have reduced to concepts and
    converted into intellectual property&#151;on all this immense
    body of intellectual values the Glass Bead Game player plays
    like the organist on an organ&#133; (the Game represents) an
    elite, symbolic form of seeking for perfection, a sublime
    alchemy, an approach to that Mind which beyond all images and
    multiplicities is one within itself in other words, to God.'
    [Hermann Hesse, <i>The Glass Bead Game,</i> tr. by Richard
    and Clara Winston, Jonathan Cape, 1970, p. 14ff.] </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Knecht left the rarefied world in which he
performed with such eminence and resolved to fashion a link
between Castalia and the outside world. After making this
decision, Knecht fortuitously drowns in an Alpine lake with his
protg, a misfortune that yet points a precedent for action,
as the protg feels henceforth, life will 'demand much greater
things of him than he had ever before demanded of himself'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim thought most people missed the real message of
Hesse, himself the member of the Hermetic Circle; entranced by
the pretty dance of words and theme, they overlook the seed
message, for Hesse, in the spirit of Mercurious, is a trickster.
Like nature in April, he dresses up his code in fancy plumage.
The literary reader picks the fruit, eats quickly, and tosses the
core to the ground. But the seed, the electrical message, the
code, is in the core. The seed meaning is within, concealed
behind the net of symbols. Millbrook's Castalia Foundation was
its own 'sublime alchemy', and its own High Priest in Timothy
Leary, who saw in Hesse's story of the Castalian Order, both an
inspiration and a warning against constricting rigidity. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Groups which attempt to apply psychedelic experiences to
    social living will find in the story of Castalia all the
    features and problems which such attempts inevitably
    encounter: the need for a new language or set of symbols to
    do justice to the incredible complexity and power of the
    human cerebral machinery; the central importance of
    maintaining direct contact with the regenerative forces of
    the life-process through meditation or other methods of
    altering consciousness; the crucial and essentially insoluble
    problem of the relation of the mystic community to the world
    at large. Can the order remain an educative, spiritual force
    in the society, or must it degenerate through isolation and
    inattention to a detached, alienated group of idealists ?'
    [Timothy Leary and Ralph Metzner, <i>The Psychedelic Renew,</i>
    Cambridge, Mass., Vol. 1, No. 2, Fall 1963, p. 179.] </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For those of us who comprised the household,
Millbrook was simply 'a house', in the sense that a house is also
a home. We lived as a community of people who had accepted a
certain way of living, which had rules and goals, shared by all.
We felt that our life-style was a creative solution to the
problems of living in the cinematic, labour-saving world. We
wanted to explore our spiritual individuality, discover our
secret life within, but also to test the validity of our search
by means of living and loving and sharing with other people in
close community. It was some kind of heightened feeling of self,
combined with movement, a natural and instinctive reaction in
such a setting, the light, the landscape, an all-pervading
tactile quality about the place, the texture and the music of
natural surroundings, created a corresponding ambiance of colour,
affective tonality, and seriousness in our minds. Here we could
travel into our own minds, to remote and hitherto inaccessible
realms within. We sought the god who inhabits each and every man.
We took this lofty house and turned it into a small stepping
stone. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Elevated or metaphoric levels of consciousness have
been sought by a few men in each generation. The possibility of
transcendence has attracted the thoughts of men throughout the
ages. The visionary experience has coloured the visions of a few
Western thinkers, and has been recorded by many Eastern mystics.
It is described in the seventh book of Plato's <i>Republic</i>
and mapped in the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> and <i>The Tibetan Book of
the Dead.</i> For the most part, Western psychology has ignored
the possibilities of mind-expansion and has become almost
entirely externally oriented. During the last hundred years
particularly we have gained an incredible expertise in
manipulating the objective environment while simultaneously
setting up barriers against the exploration of the internal. This
imbalance between the outer and inner creates an over-emphasis on
action and aggressive behaviour, and a neglect of the fundamental
question of what consciousness is. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Everything is internal. Everything happens in the
mind. At Millbrook we wanted to develop a methodology to guide us
in our journey within. In the West our most ready metaphors are
neurological. At Millbrook we wanted to substitute a more
apposite imagery. We wished to confront the realities of our
nervous system, not in a clinical but in a creative setting. To
overcome the superstitious dread of 'tampering with the mind' we
set out to learn the language of inner space. Can this internal
language be understood? The problem is phenomenological. To go
into external space we have to overcome gravitational inertia. By
analogy, our ego spins around inside the mind compelling us to be
tied to its field of gravity. Transcendental experience is the
only escape from the prison imposed by the ego. It is the Saturn
rocket that boosts us into a more differentiated and freer space.
Yet so far from LSD being the withdrawal of the mind from
reality, it has enabled people to appreciate the authentic beauty
of what we understand by objective reality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the early days at Harvard we didn't know much
about this. We knew enough not to impose rules, roles, rituals on
the brain of another; enough to plan sessions beforehand in an
open way, to remove any fears a person might have that he was
going to have an experience put over him. And while we knew not
to get people out of their minds, we had to find a way to bring
them back. It was like having no equipment to plot re-entry.
Millbrook was an attempt to bring people back in a position to
sustain their spiritual transformation. And while we drew on the
collective wisdom of the great mystical texts we were not
attempting a crude transplant. We desired a coalescence of
Eastern insights and Western intelligence. A combination, for
example, of the Tantra and Western psychology. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Regularly the permanent members of the household
would participate in group sessions, using LSD, and we would take
it in turns to plan these. Fourteen people would turn on
together. The appointed guide would be responsible for the music,
the tapes, the readings, the lights. In one of these run by Dick
Alpert, we agreed not to speak for three hours, but to wholly
give ourselves in responding to the input. Dick read from Meher
Baba, the celebrated Indian mystic who ceased to speak on July
10, 1925 and communicated, through disciples, by means of an
alphabet board: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The sole purpose of creation is that the soul should be
    able to enjoy the Infinite state of the Over-soul <i>(Paramatman)</i>
    consciously. Although the soul eternally exists in and with
    the Oversoul in an inviolable unity, <i>it cannot be
    conscious of this unity</i> independently of the creation
    which is within the limitations of time. It must, therefore,
    evolve consciousness before it can realise its true status
    and nature as being identical with the Infinite Over-soul,
    which is One without a second.' [Meher Baba, 'The Divine
    Theme for Meditation', cited in C. B. Purdom, <i>The Perfect
    Master,</i> Williams and Norgate, London, 1937, p. 309.] </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After three hours we looked in the little hand
mirrors we had all been supplied with before the session and
watched the various physiognomic metamorphoses. For some people
it was like entering the world of Wilde's <i>The Picture of
Dorian Gray</i> watching 'in the dim light the hideous face on
the canvas' and realising, like Dorian, that 'each of us has
Heaven and Hell in him'. Some had a horrific experience of seeing
their faces melting or turning bright orange or red or green. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact these paranoid symptoms are described in
the Tibetan mystical writings where they are hallucinations of
devils. In Tibetan <i>tanka</i> paintings fearful dragons with
huge red eyes belch flame and smoke from their nostrils. These
are images of energy that exist in the mind. Under the session
conducted by Dick we also saw the snake, which is the coiled DNA,
the <i>Kundalini</i> serpent which lies at the base of the spine.
Once released it fills the mind and heart with light. Unprepared
for such images they create fear and terror. As we became more
sophisticated with the use of drugs and studied the mystics we
could deal with the images. We saw them as <i>mandalas,</i> as
screens of energy. By suspending analysis we were able to pass
through the screens. We noticed that in the centre of all these
images is a black hole, the vortex of mystical works. By focusing
on this swirling, sucking void we moved through its entrance to
the other kingdom. The blind spot in the centre of each <i>mandala</i>
is recognised by Tibetan monks as a device to reach
transcendence. It comes to life and triggers off archetypal
images. We learned to move through the <i>mandala</i> to Nirvana,
the state of absolute bliss. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In our hand mirrors we saw former selves, lives
past, and lives we might yet live in the present. And in this
session with a dosage of 800 gamma LSD (justified because of the
secure supportive system) we saw the multiple facets of our
potential. Indeed, 'it might be proposed that what we encounter
here is an activation of the phylogenetic inheritance.' [R. E. L.
Masters and Jean Houston, The Varieties of Psychedelic
Experience, Anthony Blond, London, 1967, p. 217] I had
experiences of living in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
and of living in India 2000 years ago. I also dissolved into a
very old man, receded into a young man, spun and shrunk into a
baby being born. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After five hours we still had not started to
verbalism We silently prepared for the period of re-entry. Here
daily consciousness is slowly intruding and our conceptual mind
perceives it with all its inhibitions, its whole pathology of
content. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'So far you have been searching for your past personality.<br>
    Unable to find it, you may begin to feel that you will never
    be the same again,<br>
    That you will come back a changed person. <br>
    Saddened by this you will feel self-pity, <br>
    You will attempt to find your ego, to regain control. <br>
    So thinking you will wander here and there, <br>
    Ceaselessly and distractedly.'<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>(The Tibetan
    Book of the Dead)</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At peak experience the being is filled with love,
joy and ecstasy; under LSD it is impossible to think of killing
anything. On reentry we would try to choose who we wanted to be.
If we were to return from spiritual heights we wanted to do so
changed, still possessed of love and radiance. This was the point
of the session, but none of us really managed it. The re-entry
periods we wanted to freeze were elusive. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dick's session was followed by a walk in the woods,
a silent exercise in looking. And after experiencing the sensuous
impact of the grass, and the trees, and the animals we went back
to the house and prepared a meal of rice and <i>tamara,</i> wine
and cheese, and we began to speak to each other. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We also played behavioural games with each
other, accumulating evidence to test various hypotheses. As an
example, in June 1965 we had all been studying Gurdjieff's <i>Meetings
With Remarkable Men,</i> Ouspensky's <i>The Fourth Way,</i> and
Orage's <i>Psychological Exercises.</i> Gurdjieff maintained that
most people sleepwalk their waking hours away, and saw his own
role as that of an alarm clock to wake people from this diurnal
somnambulism. To test this we planned a Self-Remembering game. It
started at 9.00 a.m. and, in an arbitrary sequence, a bell would
ring four times an hour throughout the day. The bell was the
signal for us to stop and record what we were doing at the time.
Under the heading EXTERNAL we answered the questions <i>Where are
you?</i> and <i>What game are you playing?</i> Under the heading
CONSCIOUSNESS we answered the questions <i>When?</i> (i.e. Past,
Present, Future), <i>Where?</i> and <i>What game?</i> As the
house was full of behaviourists this seemed a normal thing to do.
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim's wedding to 'the beautiful blonde Swedish
model' Nena Von Schlebrugge took place six weeks after I had
moved into my upstairs room at Millbrook. It was a radiant
morning and we were up early to welcome the guests, most of whom
drove up from New York. The marriage service was held in the
Episcopal church in the village of Millbrook in the early
afternoon and afterwards we returned to the estate where we had
arranged a Swedish-style buffet in all the downstairs rooms of
Castalia, so guests could wander around the house eating
delicacies. I had met most of the guests individually, or in
small groups, but this was the first really big gathering of
assorted heads. There were some 150 of us, all high on LSD, or
pot, or both. It was a brilliant festive occasion with everyone
dressed up so brightly that it was like watching an idyllic
pageant from Elizabethan England. Most of the girls had dazzling
ornaments over Indian saris. They held flowers and seemed to
glitter in an extraordinary delicacy. The men wore robes and
brightly coloured costumes&#151;harlequin pants, richly textured
jackets, sumptuous shirts. To view them on the lawn from the roof
of the bowling alley was to peep into a kaleidoscopic garden
party of glorious humanity. Castalia had been transformed into a
palace and it embraced this ceremony. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was one of those days when everyone was happy
and joyous and loving. Felicities filled the air. Charlie Mingus
played his bass, Maynard Fergusson cogitated on his trumpet, and
other musicians joined in to produce an elegant weaving series of
improvisations. Don Snyder took a wonderfully sympathetic series
of photographs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before Tim and Nena left for New York to catch the
plane to New Delhi for their first visit to India there was a
receiving line and we all filed past with our presents.
Psychedelic presents of course. Some gave hashish, some gave bags
of excellent grass. Some gave mushrooms. A snuff box of cocaine.
A quantity of LSD. The entire range of mind-expanding substances
were proffered to the newly-weds, and all the while people were
turning on. When Tim and Nena left we carried on with the
celebrations into the dawn, and watched the sun edging over the
horizon as the earth heaved over and took us into another day. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim was away for more than a month, during which
time we sent him messages about what we were doing. Tapes would
arrive at New Delhi via American Express and would be taken up to
Tim and Nena, about a mile away in Almora. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Dear Tim and Nina. We're missing you very much. We've
    been studying the works of Meher Baba, particularly his book <i>God
    Speaks</i> and we find this fundamental to our journey. We've
    also been reading Rene Daumal's <i>Mount Analogue</i> and our
    souls are climbing the mountain. Our bodies too: we've built
    our own mountain from chicken wire and plaster of paris, and
    we've painted routes and markings on this mountain, a
    metaphoric statement of where we're at, all climbing the
    mountain together. We ran seven sessions last week. Some
    wonderful. Jacky and Susan are very well. Jack is doing well
    at school, making new friends who he brings round to watch
    the deer in the park. Susan has been learning to bake. On
    Tuesday some of us went to Salvador Dali's birthday party at
    the St. Regis hotel. We were all dressed up, wearing ski
    masks, each with a different musical instrument. They were
    about to throw us out when they discovered we were Dali's
    guests. Gabi gave Dali his pet iguana for a present. Later,
    when Dali took us to the Stork Club for a meal, he paid and
    left the iguana on the table as a tip. We are sending you
    some LSD by next mail, to c/o American Express, New Delhi.
    Enough for forty trips. Love from Millbrook.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gabi, the photographer, had entered Millbrook
during the time Tim and Nena were away, a period when we spent a
lot of time working on multi-media techniques. The genesis of the
multimedia show 'Psychedelic Theatre' came about when, late one
evening, Arnie Hendin arrived at Millbrook with his girl, Lois.
He was a very active person, tall with a little beard and long
hair. He told me he was a photographer. None of us had thought
much about using photography in sessions, but Arnie mentioned it
as a possibility and asked if he could show me some of his
slides. He set up two projectors in the session room, selected
some music, and we took some LSD. Then he began to manipulate the
projector to inform his photographs with a dynamic quality.
Inexorably I was caught up in this dance of the fixed image. It
was a weird mosaic of visual rhythm, pulsating vibrating colour.
Arnie used our huge mirrors to reflect his slides and bounced
them round the room. He took them in and out of focus, blended
photographs together, and used this controlled agitation in
uncanny counterpoint with the music. These pictures were <i>real!</i>
I lived in them. A shot of the East Village, New York, would come
so alive that I could see the sounds, sense the smells, watch the
people move. At times I had to avoid the traffic. Suddenly Arnie
switched to a pastoral scene of an old New England barn, and the
mood changed abruptly. He had a triangular arrangement of three
mirrors which he put in front of the lens to break the image up
into multiple facets. Taking the slides out of focus he elevated
shapes to forms, and then reduced these to primal blobs of
chaotic colour. It anticipated Stanley Kubrik's psychedelic
continuum in <i>2001</i> when the space pod enters the visionary
atmosphere of Jupiter. I felt Arnie had visually duplicated the
early stages of the LSD experience. Words had never been equal to
the ineffable. These graceful gymnastics of colour which Arnie
had produced, by sheer artistry, were the apotheosis of
distraction. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was a magician&#151;not only a technically
brilliant photographer, but a being possessed of mysterious
creative powers, able to utilise new forms of energy. He had
understood that LSD is a non-verbal, visionary experience. An
intensity of seeing whether the eyes are opened or closed. Arnie
had changed our session room from the inside of a cigar box to
the inside of a diamond. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I asked him if there were any other photographers
who were his peers in these realms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Yes,' Arnie said. 'There is Gabi. He comes from
Detroit like me and came to New York to take up a scholarship at
the Cooper Union. Gabi spent one day looking round the place and
decided it was not for him. He lives in a small basement in the
lower East Village.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had to go into New York the following day to pick
up a Tibetan monkey which had been gifted to us. Why not see Gabi
then ? Arnie told me the address, but asked about the monkey. I
explained that the Tibetan monkey had been destined for the
Baltimore zoo, but had been rejected by the zoo. The donors were
friends of the Fergussons and suggested to them that the Castalia
Foundation could have it if we wanted. Of course, we did. So I
was to drive in and pick it up from an animal emporium just off
Broadway, near Wall Street. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I drove into New York next morning in the Ford
station wagon we had, and went first to see Gabi. He was seated
at a table in his basement sticking coloured polo mints on to a
discarded car axle. Quite naturally he showed me a champagne
glass with broken polo mints stuck around the base. Then a silver
spoon hanging from a string in a box with the coloured sweets
stuck on to it. After a period spent looking at these and similar
creations Gabi introduced me to his animals. He had a pet iguana,
a pet crow, a pet mouse. Later on the crow ate the mouse, and the
iguana freaked the crow by doing something the crow could not
do&#151;blink! It was this same iguana that ended up on a table
in the Stork Club as the Salvador Dali tip. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gabi was a six footer, with long blond hair, and
the largest blandest eyes I had ever seen. He looked a bit like
Lewis Carroll. I suggested he come out to Millbrook, but told him
that first I had to pick up the Tibetan monkey. Would he help me
as obviously he had a way with animals ? Certainly he would, but
if we were going on to Millbrook he wanted to take his animals.
Gabi put on his head the northern hemisphere from a metal atlas,
and we boxed the mouse, and put the iguana in a cage. Gabi felt
that a trip to the financial district might so upset the iguana
that it might bite, and we didn't want that. The crow, however,
was not nearly so sensitive so we let if fly above the station
wagon and follow us to the Wall Street district. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We got into the emporium without incident, and the
crow still hung about the station wagon. The monkey, about
two-and-a-half feet high with snowy white eyebrows and beard, was
put into a huge cage. Gabi said he could speak to animals, so I
carried the cage and he carried the monkey. So we walked back to
the station wagon, an extraordinary trinity&#151;me in my raccoon
coat and tam o'shanter, Gabi with half of the world on his head,
and the Tibetan monkey completely at home in Gabi's arms. From
the looks on the faces of passers-by it seemed as if a whole
section of New York had freaked out! Rush hour took on a new
meaning. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As soon as we got back to Millbrook everyone wanted
to see some of Gabi's psychedelic magic. He installed the animals
and then set up projectors, as Arnie had done. We were soon
transfixed by the beauty, dazzling colour, and unique insights
performed by Gabi with light and colour. The magicians were
taking over. And we liked it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This development led to other groups coming.
Probably the most important was USCO&#151;'US company'&#151;three
performers from the artists' colony at Woodstock, N.Y. The group
comprised Gerd Stein, poet and former <i>Playboy</i>
correspondent; Steve Durkee, previously a pop artist; and Michael
Callahan, an electronics technician. USCO communicated through a
multichannel media mix, a psychedelic orchestra of film, colour
slides, kinetic sculpture, strobe lights, and live actors. They
had developed a system of linking all projectors to one control
manual. With this ability to control all visual effects from one
source they used techniques of spinning sound from one speaker to
another. This, in conjunction with the images, seemed to us to
offer an exciting dramatic possibility, a unique form of theatre.
A performance where the audience would be involved intimately in
the field of action, participating. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At Millbrook we did not isolate ourselves
hermetically from the world outside, but wished to contribute to
and reflect something of the spirit of our time. Our Psychedelic
Theatre or 'Tranart' (transcendental art) did not arise like a
diversion or arrive like a gilded Pavlova. It grew out of alembic
of creative minds, from aspects of personal experiences of
living. We continually exposed ourselves to novel departures in
our conceptual, label-making process and tried to get rid of
ideas of what art must necessarily be. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the case of the Psychedelic Theatre we suspended
the general assumption that Theatre is concerned solely with
formal, fixed construction like the plays of Ibsen. We wanted to
avoid the mistake tacitly committed by both spectator and artist
of submitting to a mental trap of knowing what is expected of
them. The Psychedelic Theatre arose out of something like the
cave-paintings of primitive man interested in constructing a
piece of reality from the flux. It was a theatre of controlled
spontaneity, offered not as a virtuoso performance by a
signature-artist, but as a sensory embrace. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first public psychedelic event ever performed
was at the Village Vanguard jazz club in Greenwich Village on
Monday, April 5, 1965. Those taking part were myself, Dick
Alpert, Alan Watts, Charlie Mingus, Pete La Roca, Steve Swallow,
Charlie Lloyd, Ralph Metzner, Susan Leary, Mario (a dancer), and
Bjoern Von Schlegrugge as stage manager in charge of the
electronic equipment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I introduced the event thus: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Our purpose in being here is to expand our awareness. To
    assimilate and to see aspects of the psychedelic
    consciousness. To observe the phenomena of inner space. This
    is the Magic Theatre. By magic we mean the phenomena of
    everyday life through which we pass most of our time asleep.
    Tonight we shall be mixing auditory and visual phenomena. The
    brain is capable of processing all this data. It will see
    different images moving in a random/planned fashion. Sound
    tracks, some of which have been cut up, will be heard. Films
    and light will perform. All you have to do is focus on one
    point. And then you will see the rest. Diversity will be
    unity. But do not try to understand. The brain will do all
    that later. Here you will have 10,000 visions. So sit back
    and relax. Extend yourself to an aesthetic distance. You may
    have the opportunity of leaving your body. Leaving your mind.
    You are going on a voyage. The price of admission is your
    mind. For if you attempt to analyse and conceptualise you
    will cheat yourself of the opportunity to see things in a
    fresh manner.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then I read: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Is it a dream ? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Shadowy<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Elusive<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Invisible <br>
    All things <br>
    All images<br>
    Move slowly <br>
    Within<br>
    Shimmering nets </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Here<br>
    Essence endures<br>
    From here<br>
    All forms emerge<br>
    All forms<br>
    Emerge<br>
    From this second<br>
    Back to the ancient beginning<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>(Tao Sutra 21)</i>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And we began. The impact of this event is perhaps
best appreciated from the review in the <i>New York Times</i> of
Sunday, April 11, 1965: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Tamara, her blonde hair falling to her baggy white
    pyjamas, was passing out Tibetan incense. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; ' &quot;That's because it's delightful,&quot;
    she explained. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The patrons who jammed the 123-seat basement
    jazz club accepted the offerings with an equally earnest
    mysticism, for they had come to experience the debut of the
    Psychedelic Theatre&#151;a simulated &quot;session&quot; with
    the consciousness expanding drug Lysergic Acid Diethylamide,
    or LSD. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'It was &quot;speakout&quot; night at the
    Village Vanguard&#133; last week an LSD symposium transcended
    the merely verbal because, as a grave young man backed by a
    throbbing bass declaimed, &quot;Our limited lexicography,
    with its procrustean subject-object limitations cannot
    communicate this experience.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Darkness. Up tempo bass. Lights flash through
    the audience; slides flash on a sheet: Mount Rushmore,
    biological specimen, Buddha sliding in and out of focus.
    Drums and a clarinet pick up the rhythm. Tamara, accompanied
    by Tasha, a thin, haunted-looking young man also in baggy
    whites; they dance, not quite to a twist, with Siamese arm
    motions. Later, more dancing, to the Beatles, while a
    flickering blue light seems to stop the motion into jerks....
    A noise like three monotone bears trapped in a sewer,
    transforming itself into an oriental fluting, bonging and
    chanting. A movie of a frog embryo in a glass bowl, evolving
    rotating and flipping to a cool jazz score, while a voice
    quietly intones universal truths and insights: &quot;&#133;
    muddy water cannot be fathomed.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'A hundred would-be experiencers were turned
    away, business at the bar was slow, and the audience was rapt
    and curiously split. &quot;There's an awful lot of uptowners
    here,&quot; muttered a hostile hipster, glowering at a
    section of Wednesday matinee women. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'There was a scattering of ageing beards, but
    the other face was that of youth, sure of its
    terminology&#151;&quot;Cosmic consciousness&quot;,
    &quot;re-entry&quot;, and &quot;set&quot;. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Some matched the religious fervour of the
    performers, residents of a Millbrook, N.Y. &quot;utopian
    colony&quot; who soberly passed out jelly beans and balloons
    during intermission.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As well as passing out jelly beans (which some of
the audience imagined, with delight or apprehension, depending on
their attitude, to be treated with LSD) we gave Dick Alpert a
spot. He sat on a stool and began telling funny stories about his
experiences at Harvard, about his early experiences with his
millionaire father, and how this world now seemed several light
years away. The audience laughed uproariously at Dick's stories
and, after the show, the owner of the Vanguard, Max, came up to
Dick. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'You are a natural-born comedian. Would you like to
try a week here as a comedian, doing what you did tonight?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dick said he would try it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A couple of weeks later Dick took up the offer.
Unfortunately only half a dozen people were watching him and they
were boozy and incapable of understanding Dick. Apart from
myself, who accompanied Dick to New York for his 'gig', and some
friends, no one got the point of his humour. It simply seemed
crazy to them that a man could jeopardise an enviable family
security and a top academic job to live as Dick was doing then.
It was clear to us that for Dick's jokes to be understood
everyone had to be high. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Subsequent to the Village Vanguard evening we set
up a regular Monday night series of 'Psychedelic Explorations' at
the New Theatre, East Fifty-Fourth Street, in collaboration with
USCO. There would be lectures, psychedelic improvisations,
discussions, performances by the Castalia Foundation and USCO,
and finally an informal question-and-answer period. The idea was
that the Psychedelic Theatre would illustrate and amplify the
themes discussed in the lectures which in turn supplied the
theoretical background necessary for an understanding of the new
techniques of audio-olfactory-visual alteration of consciousness.
Our other main forum was the Coda Galleries in the East Village.
This opened in April 1965 and acted as a salon for exhibitions,
discussions and demonstrations. It proved immensely successful
and on one occasion some 6000 Villagers tried to cram into the
sixty-five-person capacity gallery to hear a panel of
psychologists and artists discuss the value of chemically-induced
transcendence for artists. The Coda's director, Ray Crossen, also
sponsored the 'Theatre of the Ridiculous' and many
poetry-readings in which I took part. There is no question but
that the work we did at that time in New York has been seminal in
the development of kinetic and optical art, the new cinema, and
freer forms of theatre. It opened up a whole vista of new
entertainment possibilities. Arnie Hendin, who had suggested so
much of this potential growth on his first evening at Millbrook,
was by now developing into a one-man theatrical event; as three
Yale psychologists were shortly to find out. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So involved had we been in the Psychedelic
Theatre and so closely had we communicated with Tim in India that
it seemed like days not months had passed when he eventually
returned with Nena. After the preliminary salutations of welcome,
Tim made it very clear that he had mainly learned from India that
all fire and metals should be kept underground. 'The great work
of the future,' he said, 'will be to return fire and metal back
to earth. This will be a work of joy. All works of destruction
involve fire and metal. We must overcome them. In future we will
separate our garbage into metallic and non-metallic substances.
All the metal must be buried.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I took it upon myself to bury all the empty tin
cans by sticking them upside-down into the footpath through the
garden. So we would walk on the metal and it would eventually
subside into the earth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim began to take up his psychological work with
some intensity and announced one morning that three senior Yale
psychologists were coming to see around Millbrook that afternoon.
Tim wanted this to be a serious exchange of ideas so he asked
Arnie Hendin&#151;who wore funny hats, trousers made out of
multicoloured curtain-material, and bells&#151;if he would mind
discarding his technicolour clothes for the duration of the
psychologists' visit. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Uhuh,' nodded Arnie. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, true to his word, he went to borrow a lounge
suit and a tie and a white shirt and shoes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychologists arrived for lunch and sat, rather
stuffily, listening to an affable Tim making jokes and
lighthearted conversation. Most of the members of the household
present for lunch were stoned, but, in deference to Tim's wishes,
we maintained an external propriety. In the middle of lunch Arnie
walked in sporting his splendidly conventional outfit and
carrying a copy of the <i>New York Times</i> under one arm. He
nodded and sat down opposite the three psychologists who seemed
suitably impressed by his impeccable attire. Arnie opened the <i>Times</i>
and began to read it. Then he smiled and, as he did so, a trickle
of green liquid started spilling from the corners of his mouth,
and slowly ran down to his little beard. Next Arnie opened his
mouth a little and the green liquid spurted over his chin and on
to his white shirt. By now everyone was staring at Arnie, so he
opened his mouth in a yawn and the green gushed from his mouth
over his newspaper and his shirt, all the while reading the news
as if nothing was happening. Arnie had filled his mouth with
green vegetable dye and it produced the first one-man happening I
had ever seen. The psychologists observed this event fastidiously
and seemed, from frowns and raised eyebrows and movements of the
mouth, to have agreed that this irreproachably dressed young man
was inoffensive&#151;merely afflicted by a slight idiosyncrasy.
Tim said nothing at all about it. Neither did we. It seemed the
wisest course to smother the scene in silence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After lunch, Arnie having excused himself with a
nod, we suggested to the psychologists that we show them around
the house. Indulging the frivolity of a moment, one of the
psychologists asked if we had any animals in addition to the four
dogs that wandered about the front porch. Tim pointed to the line
of Tibetan monastery flags strung along the turrets on the roof
of the house and jocularly linked that with the presence of our
Tibetan monkey upstairs. Often the monkey roamed about the house,
but at meal times it had to be kept in its huge cage because it
would perch high up on shelves and throw eggs at people.
Obviously that couldn't happen to a distinguished group of Yale
psychologists. Tim said he would remember to show them the
monkey. We got to the room, entered, and there, sitting in the
cage with a banana in one hand and engrossed in the <i>New York
Times,</i> was Arnie. Tim let the psychologists draw their own
conclusions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arnie was not only magical and mischievous, though;
he could be practical. Once Dick Alpert got a severe cold, dosed
himself with aspirins and sleeping pills and retired to the
bowling alley where he curled up in a sleeping bag before the big
log fire. Arnie asked me about Dick and I confirmed that Dick was
miserable and had just gone off to try to sweat out the cold in
front of the fire in the bowling alley. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'He doesn't need to do that,' said Arnie. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Oh ? Why not ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I know of a way to cure colds.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had considerable faith in Arnie's powers and
agreed to accompany him at midnight to see Dick. When we got into
the bowling alley Dick was sleeping like a twisted log in front
of the burning fire. Arnie started to prepare the room. He
arranged coloured pieces of glass on the floor and built a shrine
with a statue of the Buddha quite near to Dick and his sleeping
bag. Then Arnie lit about twenty candles. I was watching him, at
a loss to see what he was doing other than to create a setting
that would normally appeal to Dick. Arnie rushed out again and
came back with a primus stove and a huge metal crucible in which
he melted lead. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'This,' smiled Arnie, 'is an old recipe for curing
colds.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I nodded. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Every now and then Arnie would throw an apple or a
banana into the molten lead and they rapidly disintegrated into
sparks which filled the room with a pungent smell. Arnie felt he
should now wake Dick but it proved impossible. So Arnie filled a
hypodermic with DMT (N,N-dimethyltryptamine&#151;a very
fast-acting but temporary psychedelic drug which throws the
subject into fantastic realms and renders him incapable of
physical action) and injected Dick in the buttocks. Just as he
was pulling the needle out, Dick sat bolt upright and we watched
him maintain this position rigidly for half an hour while he
swirled through neurological space. When he came round, Arnie fed
him 800 gamma of LSD from a spoon. After about fifteen minutes
Dick turned round and saw the flowing colours of the glass, the
Buddha, and the crucible. He looked at Arnie, who was wearing a
hat with a tassel of bells, like a troll from Ibsen's <i>Peer
Gynt,</i> and who still periodically threw fruit into the molten
lead. As a final measure Arnie put on three separate
record-players simultaneously&#151;a Beethoven symphony, a
Coltrane record, and a Stockhausen record, all at full volume.
Dick seemed to swim in this incredible sonic tidal wave for an
hour. Arnie asked Dick if his cold was any better. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dick smiled: 'It's gone completely.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The wonder was that he was still there after such
drastic treatment, but in fact the cold never returned. We might,
therefore, claim that Arnie had found a cure for the common cold,
but somehow I cannot see his methods being universally adopted by
the medical profession. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Millbrook was not confined to the activities of
the permanent household. As its name spread we received many
people we admired. As I had been the first person to turn Tim on
to LSD, with what he felt were satisfactory results, I was
usually called upon to act as guide for the special guests.
Several of these had memorable trips. Feliks Topolski got in
touch with me, saying he had heard about me from Alex Trocchi in
London. Feliks had come to New York to do murals in the St. Regis
Hotel and when he arrived at Millbrook we agreed to do a Cook's
Tour of the mind. We went to the upstairs room of the bowling
alley and I decided to concentrate the visual input on colour,
using the projectors to suggest amorphous masses of
undifferentiated tonality. I blended images and sounds and let
Feliks think on them. </p>

    Remember the unity of all living things. <br>
    Remember the bliss of the Clear Light.'<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>(The
    Tibetan Book of the Dead)</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The session commenced in the late afternoon, and at
one point Tim came into the room with Billy Hitchcock. Not
wishing to disturb Feliks they sat in a corner, talked briefly,
and then left without interfering with Feliks. To Feliks,
however, this seemed like a conspiratorial tte--tte, and he
said to me when they'd gone: 'Wow, they're just like gangsters.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our session continued into the early hours of the
next morning and as the first light was being refracted from the
clouds I took Feliks out on to the balcony of the bowling alley.
Just as we stepped outside there was a flash of lightning. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The world is charged with the grandeur of God. <br>
    It will flame out, like shining from shook foil&#133; '<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Gerard Manley
    Hopkins, 'God's Grandeur') </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Feliks was stunned. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'My goodness,' he mumbled in his gentle way, 'look
at that.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Yes,' I smiled, 'we try to do our best for someone
on his first session.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dawn came, and later sunlight filled the entire
room. Another day, another world, had come. We went back on the
balcony, smelling the air, listening to the sounds of the birds,
feeling as if we were being reborn with the day. And as our eyes
were scanning the horizon we saw a car being driven very fast up
the road followed by clouds of dust. The car halted at the
bowling alley and out stepped Arnie, a male friend, and a
girlfriend. They were naked, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; and painted all over with colourful symbols. One of
Arnie's legs was blue, another green, and looking down I could
make out a painting of a torso on his forehead. All he had on was
a feather in his hair. He brought a flute out of the car and his
friend got a saxophone. Then they started to play and dance at
the same time. It lasted a few minutes and then they got back
into the car and drove off. They came from nowhere, hadn't been
expected, and went away again. Disappeared. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'This was a very vivid hallucination,' Feliks said
to me. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I knew it had not been an hallucination, but had to
question the whole concept of what was real and what unreal at
Millbrook. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Saul Steinberg the cartoonist, who lived in New
York, came up for an LSD session. He was very fond of romantic
composers and I played records of Ravel, Debussy and Chopin. I
laid on some large drawing cards and pencils in case he wanted to
draw, but he didn't. Nor did he want any slides. We used a
downstairs room in the house, and respecting his wishes for as
much solitude as possible, asked the others not to disturb him.
After turning him on I left and looked in every hour or so to see
how he was doing. He was quiet, smiling at the fire, but asked me
to stop the music. He was finding it abrasive and brittle though
this was his normal preference for music. Hours later he came out
on his own and spent some time with our coatimundi, a South
American animal resembling a raccoon. It was a friendly beautiful
animal and it curled up in Saul's lap. He put his finger to its
mouth and it gently rested its teeth on his finger. I sat beside
Saul on the porch for a while, then he went off on his own for a
walk through the woods. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Driving him back to Poughkeepsie for the train to
New York next day, l asked Saul if he had gained anything
permanent from his LSD experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I discovered trees,' he said. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Saul's life was usually spent either in his New
York home or in his little summer house in East Hampton, a select
Long Island bathing resort for the very wealthy. The trees he saw
there seemed desiccated. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'At Millbrook I discovered real trees. I have never
thought about trees before. That was the principal thing I got
from the session.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And sure enough about two months later, on the <i>New
Yorker</i> cover, there was a Steinberg drawing which
featured&#151;a huge tree. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On Monday, April 19, 1965 Paul Krassner came for a
session. Krassner, editor of <i>The Realist</i> and later, with
Abbie Hoffman, founder of the Yippie party, took LSD with me
upstairs in the bowling alley. Krassner later recorded his
experience in <i>The Realist</i> No. 60, June 1965: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'My LSD experience began with a solid hour of what my
    &quot;guide&quot; described as cosmic laughter. The more I
    laughed, the more I tried to think of depressing
    things&#151;specifically, the atrocities being committed in
    Vietnam&#151;and the more wild my laughter became . . . I
    laughed so much I threw up. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
    The nearest &quot;outlet&quot; ws a windoe. My hands seemed
    absolutely unable to open it. My guide opened the window with
    ease, and I stuck my head out. Was this a guillotine ? Was he
    to be my executioner ? Such fantasy occurred to me, but I
    trusted him and concentrated instead on the beautiful colours
    of my vomit. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'On the phonograph, the Beatles were singing
    stuff from <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>&#133; I started
    crying&#133; for false joy, it turned out. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I had seen the film with my wife&#151;we are
    separated&#151;and there was, under LSD, an internal
    hallucination that she had not only helped plan for this
    record to be placed, but, moreover, in doing so, she had
    collaborated with someone she considered a schmuck in order
    to please me.... Filled with gratitude, I decided to call her
    up (the power of positive paranoia), but I <i>also</i>
    decided that she had planned for me to call her up against my
    will.... Then I called&#151;collect, since I was in another
    city. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The operator asked my name. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I suddenly answered: &quot;Ringo Starr !&quot;
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; ' &quot;Do you really want me to say that
    ?&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I was amazed at my calm, logical response:
    &quot;Of course, operator. It's a private joke between us,
    and it's the only way she'll accept a collect call.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The operator told my wife Ringo Starr was
    calling collect, and naturally she accepted the call. When I
    explained why I was calling, she told me I was thanking her
    for something she didn't even <i>do.</i> I had been so sure
    I'd <i>communed</i> with her.... ' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Millbrook was music and musicians, too. Charlie
Mingus and I were in the kitchen one evening, high on LSD, and
unaccountably the tap started making yowling sounds followed by
bangs. Charlie got out his bass and played <i>arco</i> in
counter-point to the sound coming from the watertap. He seemed to
know exactly the pattern of the sound. 'I am conducting the
sound,' Charlie told me. 'I've taken it over. I've tuned into the
vibrations and resonate to them.' Millbrook was Charlie Lloyd
playing his flute in the woods. I walked in the woods during the
afternoon following the agitated sound of flute music. And there
was a very high Charles Lloyd playing to a squirrel who jumped
from branch to branch. Charlie performed a flute <i>obligato</i>
which matched and predicted the movements of the animal. It was
as if it was bewitched by the music as it slowed down and
relaxed. It was like watching a Disney film. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Millbrook was Pete La Roca, the drummer, taking LSD
and wanting to play. We hung a sheet from the ceiling and
projected on to it a nine-minute time-lapsed colour film sequence
of a frog embryo. From a black dot in the middle of the screen it
grew into a tadpole and the eyes and head appeared. Pete drummed
in the dark, behind the sheet, providing a rapid pulse that
speeded up at the climax of the film. His wife said she had never
heard him play so fast. He seemed hypnotised by the record of
creation before him. And Steve Swallow, the bass player
associated with Mingus, took LSD and watched one of Arnie
Hendin's photographs of a flower being taken in and out of focus
and mixed with colour filters. I was operating the projector,
when I heard Steve stop playing his bass and groaning 'It's so
beautiful, it's all so beautiful'. Then there was a double crash
as Steve and the bass fell to the floor. He had fainted. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jazz musicians, psychiatrists, social scientists,
people who were crazy enough to think us crazy. Mediums,
spiritualists, people who had had spontaneous visions, church
ministers. They all came to Millbrook by special appointment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From my point of view one of the most interesting,
fluent and beautiful visitors was Joan Wainscott, an American
girl in her mid-twenties who had been studying anthropology at
London University. She had acquired a convincing English accent,
very sharp and unbreakable. She told me she was a second-degree
witch in the British Coven of Witches, and that she had spent a
year in Africa living with primitive tribes. Before our LSD
session she told me about witches. She reckoned they were
priestesses of religion who had simply had a bad press down the
centuries. They followed a divine calling. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We chatted one another up and then had our session.
During this I read her 'Gate of the Soft Mystery', the Sex Cakra:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Valley of life<br>
    Gate of the Soft Mystery<br>
    Beginnings in the lowest place<br>
    Gate of the Soft Mystery <br>
    Gate of the Dark Woman <br>
    Gate of the Soft Mystery <br>
    Seed of all living <br>
    Gate of the Soft Mystery <br>
    Constantly enduring <br>
    Gate of the Soft Mystery <br>
    Use her gently and <br>
    Without the touch of pain.'<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>(Tao Sutra 6)</i>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It became obvious that we were going to make love.
We fed each other grapes, and touched each other on the hands and
face. Slowly we merged together in an ecstatic union. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What disasters we did have usually had a comical
aspect. As most of the household had taken LSD anything up to 200
times we did not see fit to store it surreptitiously. For
example, some liquid LSD was poured into a half-empty port bottle
and left on the top floor, usually out-of-bounds to visitors. A
Canadian TV crew came to record a Weekend Experimental Workshop
for a programme called <i>Seven Days on Sunday.</i> The head of
the CBC crew, a large man of about six feet, eight inches, began
to wander about the house on his own. When he saw the bottle of
port, to him a measure of normality in an inscrutable world, he
guzzled down a few slugs. Within twenty-five minutes he was on a
very high LSD trip, something he was not prepared for. We were
sitting in the dining-room when this huge man lumbered in with
one shoe off, his tie half undone, his jacket buttons ripped off,
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 'his doublet all unbrac'd; <br>
    No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd <br>
    Ungarter'd and down-gyved to his ankles; <br>
    Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; <br>
    And with a look so piteous in purport <br>
    As if he had been loosed out of hell <br>
    To speak of horrors.'<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    (Shakespeare, <i>Hamlet</i>) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The weekend visitors found it somewhat
extraordinary that this huge TV producer, ostensibly present to
record the activities with a detached professional eye, should be
stumbling around under the influence of LSD quite incapable of
doing anything. We sat with him through the night, comforting him
and playing music, until he was afraid no longer. In the morning
he was fine. I hope the programme was too. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is the sudden impact of the unexpected that
causes so many bad trips on LSD. Or any other drugs for that
matter, as I was to discover when I tried JB118 (the space drug)
in an attempt to go as far as possible in mapping the inner
Hebrides. The connection with NASA, who were developing JB118
came quite by chance. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One morning the telephone rang. It was a Dr. Steve
Groff calling from Miami. As staff hypnotist with NASA he was
interested in the use of psychedelic substances in connection
with astronaut training. He had just come from the space centre
and told me that all the astronauts had taken LSD to prepare
themselves for weightlessness and disorientation due to the lack
of external coordinates from which to take their bearing. Could
he come to Millbrook for a session to see how we were
administering LSD? Could he examine for himself our claim to have
joyful experiences with LSD, a claim in direct contradiction to
the results of sessions taken in clinical psychiatric
surroundings ? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Of course,' I said. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Groff arrived and I ran the session for him. During
the session he played the Beatles' <i>A Hard Day's Night</i> so
many times that I, as guide, felt it truly <i>was</i> a hard
day's night. Then after he was saturated with the music we took a
walk on the lawn. He told me how he had been in the Olympic
sky-diving team and that the LSD experience had certain
similarities with a free-fall from an airplane. After describing
his sky-diving exploits in some detail he suggested we go to
Poughkeepsie airport to rent a plane. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was easier than I expected. At the airport he
presented his Hertz rentaplane card and his flight licence and
within minutes a small Cessna had been put at his disposal and we
were airborne. As we had no maps we followed the winding road to
Millbrook and flew towards the turreted house where apparently
miniscule Tibetan flags fluttered. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By this time there were people up on the roof, and
some on the verandah and we were 4000 feet high physically, and
higher still metaphysically, when Groff began to zoom to within
twenty feet of the roof before shooting back into the sky. We did
this about a dozen times and enjoyed seeing friends waving up at
us. It was a strange visceral experience, like going on a huge
roller-coaster on Coney Island. I felt no fear, but enormous
elation and was disappointed when after half an hour Groff
returned the plane to the airport. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Over lunch Dr. Groff told me of his friend Jim
Arender, the former world champion sky-diver. If anyone would
appreciate a session it was Jim. And three days later Jim
arrived, twenty-six, handsome, dynamic. All-American in
appearance but with an un-American interest in astrology. Jim
brought along a movie of himself sky-diving and we showed this to
him backwards during his session by bouncing the images off a
mirror. He was stunned at the correlation between memories of
actual flights and the heights reached during his session. And he
stayed on at Millbrook to repeat the experience many times. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The links made through Dr. Groff with NASA resulted
in us obtaining some JB118, the space drug officially on the
secrets list. Dick and I volunteered to try it and remarked that
it looked as if we were becoming the guinea pigs for NASA and the
CIA. We went to the recording room and when Dick sat down on the
couch I took up the lotus position on the floor. We ingested the
drug and waited for the slight change in body metabolism one
associates with LSD. But wham ! ! ! ! This took effect instantly
in the somatic sensory areas. I felt myself moving round the room
in leaping acrobatic backward somersaults. I could not prevent
this, yet I was not hitting any of the electronic equipment in
the room. I was spinning round and round the centre of the room
gliding past everything. I had the absolute conviction that I was
in a small space capsule about the size of a tennis ball and that
I had broken loose from the safety-belts. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I felt alarmed and sensed a paranoic antipathy to
whoever had been careless enough to put me in the capsule in such
a dangerous way. Suddenly a door in the capsule opened and Whoosh
! ! ! ! I was sucked out and down towards the atmosphere,
hurtling down an air corridor, free-falling, able to move any way
but upwards. Observers said that all the time I was spreadeagled
on the floor, lying on my stomach. But I remember a horrific
sensation and suddenly there was a lurch and I stood up. It
seemed a parachute had opened just a foot before I hit the
earth's surface. Yet it had broken my fall. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wanted to fly again and I was a crow. I started
to caw and flap my arms. <i>Caw! Caw-caw!</i> My eyes were
tightly closed and I knew what it was to be a bird. I started to
hop around the house, pegged my way downstairs and into the
dining-room. With my eyes still tightly shut I touched people to
see who they were, let my blackfeathered wings brush over human
faces. And still I didn't bump into anything. With my eyes closed
I steered my way through the house several times. Through doors.
Through corridors. Through passages. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Eventually I was coaxed back upstairs with a piece
of bread as bait and I nested militantly until I finally evolved
back into a man and came round. The whole trip had lasted three
hours. Dick had sat on the couch for the duration of the trip. He
told me his experience was fantastic. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The first thing I saw was this young chick coming in. She
    was beautiful with long dark hair. She had a glass in her
    hand and asked me if I would like some grapejuice. I said
    yes. She put a glass on the floor and proceeded to fill it
    with grapejuice until it overflowed and then a red trickle of
    grapejuice moved across the floor, up the side of the
    opposite wall, along the ceiling, down the wall near me, on
    to the floor again, and towards the couch. I had to get up as
    it threatened to pass over me. I managed to avoid it and it
    got back into the glass. It was utterly real.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I agreed. This JB118 drug made hallucinations
palpably real. LSD gave a sense of bliss and oneness with life.
JB118 was a solid slab of hallucinatory experience that offered
nothing for the traveller to bring back to the real world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even more extraordinary, if we indulge our
empirical prejudices for a moment, was the experience of Alan
Eager and Arnie Hendin on the space drug. They went on an
identical trip and were aware of doing so all the time. Like me
they were pulled into the vacuum of space and moved freely above
the blue curvature of the earth. They saw a little dot
approaching them and noticed, when it came closer, that it was a
space-craft, with the hammer-and-sickle on the side. As it
floated towards them they clung to the side and saw two Russian
cosmonauts inside the craft. The men saw Arnie and Alan and
seemed frightened. So agitated did they become that Arnie and
Alan decided to float away on their own and eventually they
returned to earth in Millbrook. Next day, March 19, 1965, it was
reported that the Soviet Voskhod 2, containing cosmonauts Pavel
Belyayev and Alexei Leonov, had encountered difficulties in
reentry. On their first attempt to do so their automatic re-entry
system failed and the Voskhod 2 pilots had to make an extra orbit
and then bring the spacecraft back to earth themselves. This
change in landing site meant a long wait in the winter cold
before rescue helicopters located them.... As few of us at
Millbrook took much interest in current news it is doubtful if
either Arnie or Alan had heard of this flight. They were sure
they had not read about it prior to taking the space drug and
firmly maintained that the delay in re-entry had been caused by
the panic of the cosmonauts in seeing them. We await confirmation
from the Soviet Union. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alan and Arnie were to take another sort of trip,
this time through the heartlands of America. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'In New York we set up a centre in a large townhouse with
    a full working theatre in the basement, bought a roomful of
    divers musical instruments and opened another chapter in the
    history of psychedelia. In reaction to the programmed
    existence at Millbrook, a constant party developed which
    continued nonstop for months. Many of the Millbrook tribe
    would visit with us on their days off to play and learn.
    After a while we got restless. There were too many people
    around and it got repetitious and dull. We decided to take a
    trip. It was very cold in New York. I was shooting a lot of
    DMT&#133; at that time a smoking form had not been
    discovered. Arnie, Cathy, Simba the Siamese cat and me, plus
    guitar, soprano sax, pocket coronet, phono, records,
    psychedelic magic kit and a suitcase of drugs piled in the
    white Alfa and headed for warmer territory. The <i>I Ching</i>
    might have suggested it, I think. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The total picture we gave freaked out every
    cop south of the Mason-Dixon line and we were busted every
    time Arnie drove. (From the driving seat that is&#133; we all
    drove at once which can be very tricky sometimes but taking a
    trip while tripping is another trip&#151;if you know what I
    mean.) Arnie and I were in costume, he looking like Jesus,
    but in baseball pants, high sneakers, beads, etc., which is
    quite the mode now&#133; in '64 it was extraordinary and
    worth a hundred gamma just to look at it. When he would add
    extra touches to his gear like those kid space-helmets we
    wouldn't get half a mile before a cop would see us go by and
    flip. No harm . . . we were always released very quickly.
    Arnie, in his best prophet manner, would promise
    interrogating police chiefs fire and flood unless we were
    released at once. It always worked.... He's a fine magician.
    Our clothing was a time trip and it caused short circuits in
    robot people. Although we ate in all types of restaurants we
    were never asked to wear ties or jackets. Mainly, I think,
    because it never occurred to them. It would have been like
    asking an Eskimo to wear a tie. After a few days' travelling
    we had it worked out pretty well. Anything we needed from the
    establishment would be gotten by Cathy as she had a fairly
    straight appearance. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'We had gotten into warm weather and we
    travelled and explored all over the countryside on and off
    the roads&#133; cutting across fields and meadows and
    treating the Alfa as if it were a Land Rover; stopping at our
    slightest whim. Antique stores, underground caverns&#133;
    far-out little towns with one gas pump the man cranked,
    little stores that sold penny candy in glass jars and had
    spittoons that were used. Rural America almost unchanged in
    fifty years. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In Charleston we checked into the bridal suite
    of the Holiday Inn, had supper in our room (preferable to
    going out) and after bathing proceeded to set up shop. Out
    came the incense, candles, bottles, India prints, mirrors,
    toys, comics, phonograph, musical instruments, movie camera,
    fireworks (we had bought $100 worth a few hours before),
    magic kit and the drugs. We had everything but grass&#133;
    the brown rice of drugs. Arnie tried to score some from our
    coloured bellhop but his mind had been whitewashed. He
    brought us a bottle of vodka which we duly set in place
    unopened. We had about thirty-five caps of beige acid which
    we hadn't tried yet. We each took a cap. As it came on we saw
    it was good and took a few more. We were feeling great and
    proceeded to get married. We had bought funny fake marriage
    licences which we signed with our other names; Vazy McKoops,
    Ring, Hank and the Cat Paw Print. We kissed, danced, lit
    roman candles off the balcony and sparklers inside, which
    Arnie photographed in the candlelight. We danced and drew
    arabesques with them, and I drew a showering sparkler out of
    the bell of the golden soprano. We were flying ! <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I took some more caps. Arnie followed. We were
    travelling very fast now. The speed of sound (all motion is
    relative) at least. Again we took some more caps and now
    really started to move. We were at a rate that was so
    glorious that we decided to add a little JB840 to it. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I went out into the hall and got some Coke.
    Then instead of putting a normal dose in a glass, overcome,
    we poured three-quarters of a bottle of JB118 into the glass
    and drank. Suddenly, violently, and with a sickening lurch we
    were moving faster than light. I fell back on the bed and had
    a vision of a Roman or Etruscan warrior holding a sword to my
    stomach. It was no vision. I knew it was real. We had
    poisoned ourselves. Death was here. Real Death. I remembered
    and gave in surrendering to it. A pain lanced through my
    right side and my convulsive gasps stopped. BLACKNESS. And
    then pinpoints of light in the stygian dark. I realised the
    lights were stars and we were moving through the very edge of
    our solar system at some unknown speed, but without the
    feeling of movement. Then to the front of my mind, I sensed
    an alien intelligence. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Curious, I probed further, trying to contact
    it, when it started a mind-probe in an area it thought empty
    of life it tripped every alarm in my nervous system and body.
    I could feel my body on earth panicking, ready to explode
    with terror. I had to withdraw the mind-probe and take care
    of my terror-struck earth body. My mind came and, carefully,
    slowly, I began to turn off the alarms and unlock the
    muscles, sinews and nerves, calm and soothe the glands and
    get my body back to normal. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'As I was working I realised through visions in
    another part of my mind, that all of us on earth are remnants
    of other races and civilisations from various solar systems
    seeded into earth bodies for a reason not yet revealed. I had
    been from this solar system originally and had been a
    galactic ambassador, quite used to dealing with other
    cultures. Arnie was not of this universe originally, and I
    vaguely saw his shape as it had been; huge, swift and
    somehow, feline&#133; fifteen feet tall, five tons and
    covered with golden fur. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I opened my eyes, candlelight flickered, and
    the Holiday Inn took shape. Then a silent screaming came into
    my mind. It was on the edge of sanity driven there by fear.
    It was Arnie, Arnie the Great, The Prophet, Magician, Seer,
    Artist, Arnie was flipping out. I tried to lock my mind on to
    his, but he was so frightened, his mind was like greasy
    Jello. I couldn't hold on, so I followed, and when it would
    stop for an instant, I would hover and try to coax him back.
    It would have been all right, but Cathy didn't understand.
    She was trying to help vocally, and every sonic vibration
    only drove him further out. It was horrible! Arnie was
    moaning and flickering in and out of reality, sanity pain and
    dimension. I finally took Cathy to the next room and made her
    promise to remain silent, but she has a very strong mind and,
    when she began thinking of medical help, I couldn't block her
    thoughts completely. Soon Arnie began to think for help. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'After a time I gave up and called the desk for
    a doctor. Less than three hours had passed when we started
    and we were still very high to say the least&#133; plus
    slightly in shock. The doctor after a game attempt to get
    Arnie hospitalised, reluctantly gave him a mild sedative.
    After several stern reminders from me that he was a doctor,
    not a judge, he finally left, radiating disapproval. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'After a few more eons&#151;earth time, about
    an hour&#151;Arnie fell asleep. By then it was dawn. We were
    asked to leave soon after. When Arnie awoke, we moved to the
    nearest motel (a block away I think) and ate in bed rather
    quietly and slept till the next day. When we awoke we ate
    some more, discussed the dumb doctor, and the strange
    intelligence we had encountered, took stock of our drugs (we
    had thrown out all of the JB), and packed, giving all the
    fireworks to a bellhop as Arnie was afraid he would set them
    off mentally. We were quite down from the experience so we
    each took two capsules (Cathy wasn't having any), and I drove
    us out of Charleston through spiral type buildings, heading
    south, the top down. By the time we were out of the
    DMT-coloured city-limits and on the open road, we were
    feeling normally glorious. The car purred, the cat slept, and
    overhead the most tremendous, white thunderhead in a
    purple-rose sky formed a glorious paean to earth and the
    future and we sped into the technicolour southern dusk.' </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Probably the most highly-publicised feature of our
work at Millbrook was the Weekend Experiential Workshop. These
were held on alternate weekends when some fifteen guests would
arrive at 7.30 on Friday evening and leave on Sunday afternoon.
The idea was to simulate the LSD experience by means of Hindu and
Buddhist yogic traditions, Gestalt therapy, Gurdjieff's
selfawareness training, and Psychedelic Theatre techniques. We
wanted to use all the means at our disposal to provide a
nonchemical means of transcendence. Our handout advertising the
Experiential Workshops outlined three steps to take to the ideal
of maximum awareness and internal freedom: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The first step is the realisation that there is more:
    that man's brain, his thirteen-billion-celled computer, is
    capable of limitless new dimensions of awareness and
    knowledge. In short that man does not use his head. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The second step is the realisation that you
    have to go out of your mind to use your head; that you have
    to pass beyond everything you have learned in order to become
    acquainted with the new areas of consciousness. Ignorance of
    this fact is the veil which shuts man within the narrow
    confines of his acquired, artifactual concepts of
    &quot;reality&quot;, and prevents him from coming to know his
    own true nature. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The third step (once the first two
    realisations have taken place) is the practical theoretical.
    How can consciousness be expanded? What is the range of
    possibilities outside of our current verbal-cognitive models
    of experience? What light do the new insights perhaps most
    important, how can the new levels of awareness be maintained
    ?' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was to provide the answers implied in the third
step that the weekend workshops in consciousness-expansion were
instituted by the Castalia Foundation. We noted carefully in our
brochure that 'because of the complicated current legal situation
in the United States, psychedelic drugs will not be used in these
workshops'. This did not prevent many visitors from asking us for
drugs but we had to protect ourselves by refusing these paying
guests. Several guests, wise to our methods, took LSD before
arriving but that was not officially our affair. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The vulgarisation of these weekends commenced at an
early stage. In an article in the New York <i>Sunday News</i> of
August 29, 1965, beneath a banner headline asking ARE THEY OUT OF
THEIR MIND ? and suggesting 'You might call these sect members a
bunch of weirdos', the article noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'On alternative weekends they are joined by ten to fifteen
    paying guests recruited by direct mail and word of mouth.
    Most are middle-class professionals&#151;teachers, doctors,
    psychologists, students. The fee of $75 a person or $125 a
    couple includes plain home-cooking and a mattress on the
    floor.... There is no happy hour of cocktail chatter.
    Instead, each guest is escorted silently to a box-like room
    in the old servant's wing and left there for an hour to
    meditate. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The rooms are decorated with madras hangings,
    wall-sized paintings of Buddha, a collage of words and images
    collected from a psychedelic fantasy, or religious posters
    from India. The only furniture besides the mattress may be a
    lamp, a bookcase or a writing table.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such succinct details suggest the guests were
paying for a self-imposed ascetic exercise in hardship, but it
was nothing of the kind. The money from the workshops paid for
oil-heating bills and food, and helped to secure a
self-supporting community for the weekends. The Castalia
Foundation, after all, was a non-profit corporation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before the guests arrived on the Friday the guides,
of which I was one, would prepare spiritually by taking LSD or
pot and would reflect on the imaginative possibilities of
Millbrook. The house would be completely silent and the guests
were met by a beautiful girl in a sari holding a flower and
giving out copies of Max Picard's text on silence: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Silence has greatness simply because it is&#133;<br>
    It is and that is its greatness, its pure existence&#133; <br>
    There is no beginning to silence and no end&#133;<br>
    Man does not put silence to the test, silence puts man to the
    test&#133;<br>
    Silence contains everything within itself; it is not waiting
    for<br>
    anything, it is always wholly present in itself and
    completely<br>
    fills out the space in which it appears&#133;<br>
    Silence is original and self-evident, like the other basic
    phenomena, like love and liberty and death and life
    itself&#133;<br>
    And there is more silence than speech in them, more of the
    invisible than the visible&#133;<br>
    There is also more silence in one person than can be used in
    a single human life&#133; ' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This observation of silence had two reasons. First,
as Tim said, 'One of the oldest methods of getting high is
silence.' Secondly, it allowed us to impose an essential mood
that saved the time of the visitors. For the first workshop we
had welcomed the guests with a cocktail party, to break the ice,
and the straights immediately plunged into the cocktail party
game of which they were the experts. 'Hi, I'm Jack Smith from
Denver, who are you?' 'Jack Smith, eh?' And so on. The whole
evening had been wasted, and as we were novices in the cocktail
party game we were completely flattened. The guests were merely
putting an extra spin on their social whirl, while the household
was brought down by the experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In instituting the idea of silence we wanted to
impress on the guests that they were entering a new kingdom. That
they were tuning out of their everyday 'normal' world and turning
on to ours. Passing through the gates of Millbrook had to be like
stepping on to a spacecraft&#151;they had to leave behind them
all their usual judgements and normative expectations. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Having welcomed them with silence we gave each
guest MESSAGE ONE which requested absolute silence and asked them
to look, listen, to non-verbal energy and <i>experience directly.</i>
With the initial ambiance established we took each guest to a
separate small room on the ground floor and gave them three more
messages to read in solitude: </p>

<p> <center>MESSAGE TWO</center> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This period of silence is designed to help you
clear your mind from routine thoughts and to encourage an opening
of your awareness in several ways. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Please follow this programme: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Fill out the question sheet. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Then spend the next ten to twenty minutes trying
to meditate. Focus on the candle and see if you can turn off
planning and thinking. Concentrate on the moment-to-moment flow
of time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. After ten to twenty minutes turn on the light
and read MESSAGE THREE. This is your game contract for the
weekend. There are many implications and meanings contained in
each paragraph. Read it carefully. Make note of any questions or
comments. These will be taken up later. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After reading MESSAGE THREE, then re-read it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Turn off the light and meditate again for
fifteen minutes. Watch how your mind keeps interrupting. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Next, turn on the light and read MESSAGE FOUR. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Wait serenely until you are contacted by a staff
member. Be aware of your body, your flow of thoughts, your
emotion (you may be bored, or feel rejected, or irritated; you
may be excited, hopeful, etc.). </p>

<p> <center>MESSAGE THREE <br>
&quot;HOW TO PLAY THE 'EXPERIENTAL WORKSHOP GAME' &quot;</center>
</p>

<p> <i>What Do We Mean by Game?</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A game is a temporary social arrangement with the
following characteristics: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; goals, roles, rules, strategies, space and time
limits, values, rituals. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All of these characteristics of any game are
subject to revision. Ecstatogenic games are voluntary and the
contract explicit. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You have been invited to participate in the
&quot;Experiential Workshop Game&quot; during your stay at
Millbrook. This means you are a three-day member of a social
system which in some ways may be novel to you. This contract is
designed to lessen your &quot;culture shock&quot; and aims to set
up a memorable weekend. </p>

<p> <i>Goals</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. To communicate and exchange ideas about
consciousness <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; and its expansion and control. Relevant <i>theories</i>
about consciousness-expansion will be
discussed&#151;neurological, philosophic, religious,
psychological, oriental. A wide variety of <i>methods</i> will
also be reviewed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. To employ several of these methods during the
weekend, to expand the consciousness of participants and to
maintain as high a level of ecstasy as possible. </p>

<p> <i>Roles</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While there are many roles involved in running such
an enterprise, in this contract we are solely concerned with the
roles involved in the visitor game. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The roles which have been most comfortable to you
and of which are of most use to you in your regular life will be
of lessened utility here and, indeed, may handicap you. The aim
of the workshop is to get out beyond your routine robot
consciousness. Thus there is little interest in who you are
(were) and much more concern with where and how far you can go.
What you can obtain during the weekend depends in part on how
much of your routine ego you can leave in your room. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; . . . Why don't you check it in your suitcase ? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Staff roles.</i> Around ten people will be
present during the weekend whose job is to facilitate the goals
of the seminar. Their functions are assigned and scheduled. <i>Visitor
roles.</i> In general, the actions of visitors are addressed
towards the two goals of the seminar: i.e. to learn as much as
possible about the theories and methods of
consciousness-expansion and to put this knowledge into practice.
It is assumed that each visitor is here because of his past
experiences and his current interest in consciousness-expansion.
It is hoped that you can contribute any special knowledge you
have when it seems relevant. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>The Seeking Help Role.</i> This is not a
psychotherapeutic situation and the doctor-patient game is not
played. Personal problems cannot, therefore, become the focus of
discussion. </p>

<p> <i>Rules</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Be aware of and try to minimise the attempt of
your robot to capture audiences for its personal dramas. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Please obey the laws of the land. In particular
do not bring marijuana or any other illegal chemical to the
weekend workshop. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Visitors are asked to maintain their own room
during their stay. </p>

<p> <i>Strategies</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ecstatic-psychedelic experience can be reached
by several means: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; intellectual <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; emotional <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; bodily movement <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; sexual <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; somatic-sensory <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the aims of the workshop is to encourage
expansion of consciousness in all five of these functions in some
sort of balanced harmony. (Consciousness-expansion in the sexual
will be limited to indirect methods.) Since the average person
quickly falls into habitual and stereotyped modes of
awareness&#151;mental, emotional, physical, sexual, and
instinctive&#151;the weekends are designed to produce novel
experiences which deliberately &quot;break through&quot; these
stereotypes. If you feel yourself reacting with shock or outrage
at the challenge to your favourite habits, please remember that
this sort of friction probably points to an under-development of
some function and is a challenge for growth. For the same reason,
do not concentrate only on one of these methods of
consciousness-expansion. Take advantage of this opportunity to
expand consciousness at all levels. </p>

<p> <i>Space Factors</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After a while one of the staff will show you around
the house and grounds. During your leisure time you are free to
use any areas except for the third floor (which is residential)
and the kitchen, except during breakfast period. </p>

<p> <i>Time Factors</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The schedule of programmes will be announced.
Consult a staff member about additions and revisions to the
schedule and about leisure play. </p>

<p> <i>Values</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to the &quot;game model&quot;, values are
specific to the particular game and hold only for the defined
spacetime limits of the game. In the ecstatic game, the
&quot;goodness&quot; or greatness of your robot performance is of
lessened importance. Each person starts each second with a fresh
neurological slate. &quot;Good&quot; is what raises the ecstasy
count of all persons present and &quot;bad&quot; is what lowers
the ecstasy count. </p>

<p> <i>Mythic Context</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While any human behaviour sequence can be seen as
unique and original, another illuminating perspective can be
obtained by recognising that certain classic human games are
continually being re-enacted and that any social situation you
find yourself in is a current version of an ancient drama. The
question is not How does it turn out? (that is probably
pre-ordained by the script and the role) but rather, How well do
you play your part ? and, How conscious are you of your role at
each moment ? and, How can you change your my/this game? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Millbrook Workshops are clearly a re-enactment
of one of the oldest and most ambitious games&#151;the
transcendental game, expansion of consciousness, internal
exploration, ecstatic discovery. Our endeavours here are
descended from and indebted to those groups of explorers in
India, Persia, China, Greece and to their current western
counterparts. </p>

<p> <i>Rituals</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The creation of consciousness-expansion experiences
usually involves rituals&#151;some of which are directly
practical, others of which are designed to evoke mood or
readiness to change. The use of certain rituals (candles,
mandalas, pictures, incense, etc.) is strictly experimental and
does not involve any commitment to sectarian systems on the part
of staff members or visitors.' </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally MESSAGE FOUR reiterated the five most
important areas of consciousness accessible to the average
person&#151;intellectual, emotional, body movement,
somatic-sensory, sexual&#151;and requested the visitor to spend
the next ten minutes reviewing his stereotyped methods of
awareness in each of these five areas. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Naturally many of the visitors were overwhelmed by
reading MESSAGE THREE in solitude, and there was always one guest
each weekend who would decide&#151;in silence&#151;that the
experience was going to be too much. 'They think they have fallen
into the hands of a mad scientist,' Tim used to say, 'and that's
when we hear them creeping down the back stairs and screeching
out of the driveway.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those who stayed on would be divided into groups of
five and taken by their appointed guide for a walk in the woods
by candlelight. We walked silently in Indian file, then returned
to the oak-panelled library for a lecture by Tim or Dick or Ralph
or myself. We outlined and discussed our philosophic and
methodological ideas and hoped that the guests would sleep on
them. For some sleep was rather difficult as they tried to
anticipate what was to come. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Saturday morning breakfast was a food game.
Everyone had to be up at 7:30 for Ralph Metzner's yoga session,
including instructions on sitting in the full lotus and
half-lotus positions, standing on the head, and eliminating the
doubting fly of the mind. After this Ralph took them to the
kitchen for breakfast (where a cupboard door bore the legend
'Take LSD and See') and let them look at it for a while. He had
reversed the visual connotations of all the food. The scrambled
eggs were green, the porridge was purple or bright orange, the
milk was black. As the guests sat down to eat Ralph would say: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Our ideas dictate to us what we imagine reality to be.
    And we are very much affected by the imprints we have,
    particularly those of colour associations. When someone says <i>sky</i>,
    we think of blue, when someone says meadow we think of green,
    when someone says <i>scrambled eggs</i> we think of yellow.
    But this is a mental hangup. It doesn't really make any
    difference whether scrambled eggs are green as they are
    today, or whether they are yellow. Why is this ? All of these
    colour changes were achieved by a non-toxic, odourless,
    tasteless vegetable dye and as you are eating your green
    scrambled eggs and drinking your glass of black milk try to
    reconcile in your mind the different subjective responses
    that you have, and notice how your brain deals with this
    input.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Needless to say Ralph always took the precaution of
eating before the visitors and he would sit and observe their
attempts to appreciate the anti-food. Hardly any visitor got
through this breakfast and, as well as having a mental impact,
this method of serving food cut down our weekend budget as we
only needed to offer very small portions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The rest of the morning was spent in sweeping up
the parquet floors, and in relaxed preparation for the simulated
session. In the afternoon I would take groups to the waterfall
where, submerged in the gently churning water at the bottom of
the fall, I had a bottle of sherry on a string. As my group stood
looking at the waterfall I would slowly pull this piece of
string, finally revealing the sherry bottle. I also had a box of
glasses hidden in the bushes flanking the waterfall. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After spending some time in the woods we went back
for the evening meal, taken in the huge dining-room where guests
sat crosslegged or knelt on cushions around a circular table
raised six inches above the ground. From this room, dominated by
the massive fireplace, great windows offered a view of the front
lawns. There was an oak-panelled ceiling, a carpetless parquet
floor, and sliding doors which led off into the corridor. The
meal was simple brown rice or wheat and fruit. Hiziki soaked in
water. Baked pumpkin. Aduki beans and onion. And our own bread
baked from roast corn flour, water-salt, and sauted vegetables.
The meal itself was a yoga. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Once the guests were seated, the mantra OM was
chanted by Tim, followed by a suitable period of silence. Then a
little bell would ring and a disembodied message would be relayed
into the room: 'With the next mouthful of food contemplate on the
wonders of the body: where this food goes, how it is digested,
how it is transformed into energy, into you. Think carefully as
you chew the next mouthful.' </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Observe your body <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Mandala of the universe <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Observe your body <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Of ancient design <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Holy temple of consciousness <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Central stage of the oldest drama </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Observe its structured wonders <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; skin <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hair <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tissues <br>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; net of nerve </p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Observe its message.' <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>(Tao Sutra 24)</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the meal we took the guests to a long
darkened room at the back, the session room. It was dominated by
mirrors and a huge mandala painted on the ceiling. I always felt
conscious of the wood panelling and felt that at times it was
like being in a cigar box. All around were mattresses covered
with Indian prints. Slide projectors were humming in the dark.
Six speakers were linked to a tape recorder so that we could get
circular sound. Several pre-programmed movie projectors were
ready. I would then say: 'This is not a show, not something
outside yourself. We, for our part, will experience some of the
same things as you. This is a teaching device. All of us in the
household have been engaged in psychedelic work for a number of
years and we have developed methods of duplicating the world we
see on these trips. We want you to share some of these methods of
seeing inner space. We want you to go out of your minds and into
your heads.' And I would read: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Let there be simple, natural things to contact
during the session &#151;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; hand-woven cloth <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; uncarved wood <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; flowers&#151;growing things <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; ancient music <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; burning fire <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; a touch of earth <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; a splash of water <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; fruit, good bread, cheese <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; fermenting wine <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; candlelight <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; temple incense <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; a warm hand <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; fish swimming <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; anything which is over<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; five hundred years
    old <br>
    Of course it is always best to be secluded with nature.' <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>(Tao Sutra 19)</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In an instant, from all sides, came an electric
bombardment of sound and image including many of the images used
in the Psychedelic Theatre: the US flag, Buddha, the frog embryo,
amorphous colours. A voice would spin from speaker to speaker
saying:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'That which is called ego-death is coming to
    you <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember: <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; This is now the hour of death and rebirth; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Take advantage of this temporary death to
    obtain the perfect <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; State&#151; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Enlightenment. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Concentrate on the unity of all living beings. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Hold on to the Clear Light. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Use it to attain understanding and love.' <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>(The Tibetan Book of the Dead)</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there would be silence and darkness relieved
only by candlelight. Watching the perplexity on some faces I
thought how strange it was that modern Americans should find
something strange in a technique that had been used for thousands
of years in one form or other. It was clear that the one who
resisted the experience needed a new morality, a set of natural
harmonious rules to follow as they spun off into neurological
space. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They sat, some responsive, some astounded by the
assault on their senses. Just as they were becoming accustomed to
the candlelight, the stroboscope would start making multiple
divisions of light, hitting the retina in a staccato burst and
forcing chemical changes. By now the whole concept of
environmental reality had been altered. We encouraged the guests
to walk around in the flickering movement-stopping light. As a
body moved in the stroboscopic light it looked like a series of
still photographs being crudely animated. Guests who tried to
dance in the light were reduced to chaos because they could not
coordinate with their apprehension of their partner's movements.
Abruptly the strobe was stopped and we saw only the candles,
their light weaving in the warm air of human breath. Slowly the
room was bathed in yellow which is the colour of the Root <i>Cakra</i>
which we reinforced with Tibetan chanting music. After twenty
minutes the Water <i>Cakra</i> would be played on the
tape-recorder: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Can you lie quietly <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; engulfed <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; in the fierce slippery union <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; of male and female ? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Warm wet dance of engeration ? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Endless ecstasies of couples ?&#133; <br>
    Can you feel the coiled serpent writhing <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; While birds sing ? <br>
    Become two cells merging <br>
    Slide together in molecule embrace <br>
    Can you, murmuring <br>
    Lose <br>
    All fusing.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Twenty minutes after this came the Sex <i>Cakra</i>
when the room would be suffused in a pale silvery light and we
thought of the energies surrounding our sexual feelings. Ravi
Shankar music would dissolve into a Caribbean bossanova and we
watched slides of men and women in the act of love. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So on to the Heart <i>Cakra.</i> Colour of red
fire. The room bathed in crimson light. Music by Scriabin and
Miles Davis and Bach. And the sound of a child's heartbeat. Then
the Throat <i>Cakra:</i> blue bubbles of air. Debussy, Indian
music, Japanese flute music. Finally the Head <i>Cakra</i> with
Stockhausen and the sounds of outer space. Slides of the stars
and galaxies would edge around the room. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the end of this timeless session we would bring
the visitors back, carefully prepare them for re-entry: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 'As you return <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember to choose consciously <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Power is the heavy stone wrenched <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from your garden of tenderness <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Virtue is the heavy stone crushing your
    innocence </p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; What can be learned <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; From nature is <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Harmony <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore&#151; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shun the social <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cuddle the elemental <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Avoid angles, lie with the round <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Shun plastic, conspire with seed <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Do no good <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; But <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; For God's sake <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Feel good <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; And <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Nature's order will prevail' <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>(Tao Sutra 3)</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Undoubtedly many of our visitors obtained genuine
spiritual edification from these simulated sessions, though it is
my experience that they can never be a substitute for the
sacrament of LSD. For their money they had been changed in some
ways. Even those who did not seek change had access to the
Millbrook facilities of seminar rooms, meditation house, forest
paths, the lake for swimming, vegetable gardens, art and
photographic libraries, music and book libraries with an
extensive section on Eastern Philosophy, and our library of tape
lectures and experiential films. Some were astounded at what they
found. Those willing to drop the sensation-seeking game had an
insight into the religious aims of Millbrook. Though many members
of the public who might have been otherwise willing to open
themselves to the experience were alienated by lurid press
reports of which the following, from <i>The Charlotte Observer,</i>
is typical: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'A quick belt of whisky from the suitcase improves things
    considerably. OM. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; ' &quot;I am Michael Hollingshead,&quot; says
    the man in the doorway, half an hour later. He is tall,
    thirty-ish, baldish, with cold, cruel grey eyes. &quot;I am
    your guide for the weekend. Will you follow me?&quot; He has
    an English accent and a soft voice of sinister authority. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Down the hall (OM OM OM) down the stairs.
    Outside four people gather silently in the back of a battered
    Land Rover: two women and two men, one of them an egg-bald
    bespectacled young man from Ottawa. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;'Right now we're in the period of
    silence,&quot; says Hollingshead. &quot;First we'll go for a
    little drive, then a little walk, then dinner.&quot; He
    drives along a track through dusk-hushed woods, then out into
    a field and stops at a pond&#133; Hollingshead produces a
    bottle of cocktail sherry and paper cups. Dusk deepens. The
    pond is covered with a film of green growth, which creeps. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; ' &quot;Is the period of silence over ?&quot;
    asks the poison ivy woman, emboldened by sherry. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; ' &quot;Not for you,&quot; says Hollingshead
    with a little smile. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The drive continues through the woods and
    fields, then back to the house&#133; Timothy Leary enters and
    sits. He is tall, forty-five, handsome, barefoot, a dentist's
    son, the father of three: a boy, a girl, and the psychedelic
    movement&#133; Leary talks&#133; The reason psychedelic
    experiences are important and valuable is that people live
    their lives by their own &quot;chess-boards&quot;, playing
    the lawyer-game, the merchant-game, or some rule-ridden
    ego-game, rarely if ever expanding their consciousness to the
    point of true awareness and understanding of man and nature,
    including themselves. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'He demonstrates: Susan Leary and Hollingshead
    enact a short skit, she as a wife asking her overworked
    husband to take a holiday, he as a school principal firing a
    teacher. Their chessboards do not match; they do not
    understand each other&#133; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The appearance of things around Castalia's
    baroque bastion indicates a certain abandonment of modern
    survival values&#133; No particular concern is shown for the
    house&#133; Castalians are above the landed-gentry game.
    Furniture is not important to them&#133; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The woodwork and windows need washing, the old
    parquet floors need polish&#133; the dogs&#133; anoint the
    porch at will&#133; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'An air of sad decline pervades the house, like
    a Rolls-Royce being used as a dump truck.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fact that the local press had praised our work
in maintaining the house and improving the lawns and planting
three acres of corn and vegetables is beside the point. Like so
many people, that reporter looked without seeing, listened
without hearing, calculated without thinking. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had been a guide for invited guests, a guide for
paying visitors, and after taking so many people on an internal
journey I felt it might be time to do the same in other
countries. Mark Twain said that 'Guides cannot master the
subtleties of the American joke', and though he was not thinking
of a psychedelic guide, he had a point. There were too many
American jokers doing injustices to Millbrook. One of the
greatest guides, Virgil, says to a Dante tormented by frightening
phenomena </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But, as for thee, I think and deem it well <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou take me for thy guide, and pass with me <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Through an eternal place&#133; ' <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; (<i>Inferno,</i> Canto 1, tr. Dorothy Sayers)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Dante passes through a hell which in its
realistic aspects corresponds closely to the unenlightened daily
life. It is the desire of the guide to take his voyager to
paradise. As guide to many travellers I have taken them out of
their hell and offered them at least a temporary glimpse of
paradise. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The role of the psychedelic guide is new in our society,
    but the newness of the role should not blind us to the
    antiquity of its precedents. Priest and shaman, after all,
    were the first purveyors of its technique. Seer and sibyl
    mapped the cosmography of its domain. Perhaps the finest of
    its precedents is to be found in the figure of Virgil in
    Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>.... It should be one of the
    chief tasks of the guide to assume the role of Virgil in this
    chemically-induced Divine Comedy and to help the subject
    select out of the wealth of phenomena among which he finds
    himself some of the more promising opportunities for
    heightened insight, awareness and integral understanding that
    the guide knows to be available in the psychedelic
    experience. [R. E L. Masters and Jean Houston, <i>op. cit.,</i>
    p. 130f.] </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I guided Leary and Alpert through their first
trips. I guided the authors of the above passage through theirs.
I acted as guide to Krassner, Topolski, Steinberg, Mingus, Steve
Groff and dozens more. None had bad experiences. None returned
with distaste for the spiritual or natural worlds. I endorse the
ideal of the guide as Virgil, though could not claim to be an
ideal guide. At the most I could claim to be conscious of my
subject's creativity and that, in itself, is a step on the road
to paradise. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so I felt it to be time to take to the road
again myself. By September 1965 I felt that the Experiential
Workshops had been stimulating and often extremely successful. I
felt satisfied with our work in New York developing the
Psychedelic Theatre. Americans, the sensitive ones, were
responding to the wonderful implications of LSD. Artists and
scientists were admitting they could learn from mind expansion.
LSD was becoming quite popular with a growing number of people
and, in addition to the black market supply emanating from the
West Coast, two very devoted student alchemists were synthesising
it at Yale. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a European I felt the time had come for us to
share with Europe some of the things we had discovered about the
methodology of taking LSD in positive settings. I wanted to rid
people of their inhibitions about mystical writings and
demonstrate to them that <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead,</i> the
<i>Tao Te Ching,</i> and the <i>I Ching</i> were really basic
manuals with fundamental instructions about taking LSD sessions.
We felt we had supplemented this ancient knowledge by the
exploitation of modern technological means of transmitting
aesthetic phenomena. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From what I had heard in letters and conversations,
the psychedelic movement in England was small and badly informed.
It appeared that those who took LSD did so as a consciously
defiant anti-authoritarian gesture. The spiritual content of the
psychedelic experience was being overlooked. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We had a meeting at Millbrook to discuss this
question of disseminating the results of our experimental
research. It was agreed that I should return to London with the
idea of introducing <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> in the
translation by Tim, Dick and Ralph; the cyclostyled typescript of
the <i>Tao Be Ching</i> by Tim and Ralph; and the <i>Psychedelic
Review,</i> a magazine devoted to the theoretical discussion of
psychedelic experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim came to see me on the day of my departure. He
was going to join me in London in January 1966, which gave me
three months to set the scene for his arrival. The idea was to
rent the Albert Hall, or 'Alpert Hall' as Tim called it, for a
psychedelic jamboree. We would get the Beatles or the Stones to
perform, invite other artists, and, as the climax of the evening,
introduce Tim as the High Priest. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Taking a piece of paper from his pocket Tim said,
'These are your marching orders, your instructions.' What they
were I don't know because he decided to scrap them and took a
clean sheet of paper and wrote the following on it: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'HOLLINGSHEAD EXPEDITION TO LONDON 1965-66 </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Purpose: SPIRITUAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>To introduce to London the interpretation and applications
    and methods developed by and learned by Michael Hollingshead.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A YOGA-OF-EXPRESSION BY MH. <br>
    <i>Plan</i> <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; No specific programme of expression can be
    specified in advance. The Yoga may include <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Tranart* gallery-bookstore. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Weekly psychedelic
    reviews&#151;lectures&#151;questions and answers&#151;Tranart
    demonstrations. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Radio&#151;TV&#151;newspaper&#151;magazine
    educational programme. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Centre for running LSD session.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus it was I arrived London in the fall of 1965,
with several hundred copies of <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>
and thirteen cartons of the <i>Psychedelic Review</i> on their
way. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; * Tranart was the term we used to describe the art
of psychedelic simulation. The name never became widely accepted
and to this day there is no adequate label for psychedelic art . </p>

<h4>CHAPTER SIX</h4>

<h3>LONDON ON MY MIND</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<h4>London 1965</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is always interesting to come back to London
(why do we love the places we are born in ?) and see how you
react to the people. Here I am no longer 'the traveller', but a
resident, which is something you realise the moment you step
outside Heathrow&#151;abroad, you can treat the outer world as
mere reaction; at home this is impossible. When an Englishman
looks at London he is seeing in its masonry the reflection of his
race, like a clean slate, with his own face on. He may not like
what he sees, but it is a place he may nod to and really feel he
knows. Here, then, I am at the mercy of my own particular form of
existence; here I am responsible in a definite way, just a
citizen like everybody else.... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, I exchanged the consciousness of
Millbrook as rapidly as possible for that of the resident.
Through the far-sight of a generous friend, I soon became the
lease-holder of a large, comfortable, Pont Street, Belgravia
flat, with high ceilings and thick walls. It was here that we
opened the WPC ('World Psychedelic Centre') with Desmond O'Brien,
a Lloyd's underwriter and Etonian, as President; and, later, Joey
Mellen, also ex-Eton and a graduate in law from Oxford, as its
Vice-President. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had brought with me from America a quantity of
LSD, about half a gram, or enough for 5000 sessions, part of an
experimental batch made available by courtesy of the Czech
Government laboratories in Prague, who had taken over as
suppliers after Sandoz stopped selling it anymore, that is, after
the Leary-Alpert Harvard storm. But as far as Britain was
concerned, there were as yet no provisions for LSD <i>et al</i>.
under the 'Dangerous Drugs' Act. The possession of this drug did
not become an offense until the summer of 1966, when Britain fell
in line with American legislation in this matter. But it was
through this loophole in the 1965 legal situation that the WPC
was able to operate in an open way&#151;though we had to watch
anything else, particularly hash, for which we could be busted
(and eventually were, just five months after we started). But for
the time being, and encouraged by the accelerating interest in
psychedelics amongst our Chelsea neighbours, we believed that
London would indeed become the centre for a world psychedelic
movement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a city where world-feeling is expressed in the
form of an impulse for empirical expansion, our 'message' was
simple: If you can't capture the world, then try to conquer the
heavens. For the idealism of the <i>conquistador</i> would be
changed to that of the mystic, the man who conquers nobody except
himself. 'The energy which, a little while ago, was able to fill
universal space is now condensed into the confines of the
individual self; for isn't it said that what is without, is also
within ? It is just that the eye of insight&#151;the eye that
&quot;gets in&quot; where reality &quot;gets out&quot;&#151;has
atrophied in man during the past few thousand years; man is blind
to the world inside himself and needs the help of <i>three</i>
eyes instead of two to gain true wisdom of his own
individuality.' We wrote it; we may even have believed it
sometimes: and 'acid is to help us see &#133; '. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now we could believe with Camus that 'real
generosity towards the future lies in giving all to the present'.
And since it happens so rarely in a lifetime that one ever gets
the chance to give one's <i>all</i> to something, or someone, we
felt a tremendous sense of involvement now that we had pledged
ourselves to spread the psychedelic doctrine. And in one of our
earliest manifestos, we wrote </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Man's vision of the future is his recreation&#151;the
    fulfillment of it is his procreation. The essential ritual is
    procreation&#151;creation. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The future is what man thinks up in the
    present&#151;the logical extension in all cycles of thought
    of the point of each revelation&#151;the illumination of
    darkness by the word. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In the dawn of a new evolutionary phase poets
    chirp like sparrows....disregarded&#151;like
    sparrows&#151;the poets keep singing of a vision which is
    theirs <i>pour encourager les autres.... '</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the nagging question in such matters was how
were we going to communicate this message with the rest of the
world? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of us had began to wonder if the solution did
not lie in the direction first suggested by William Burroughs (in
1961): 'The forward step must be made in silence. We catch
ourselves from word forms&#151;this can be accomplished by
substituting for words letters, concepts and verbal concepts,
other modes of expression: for example, colour.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And silence is golden for those who live in the
land of gold. But from the revolutionists' point of view, the
huge monopolies of power and influence could be seen in 1964 to
have become places synonymous with intellectual bankruptcy and
spiritual (religious) emptiness. To take one example, the
situation with regard to the University Establishment. They could
be seen to be institutions of intellectual servitude: 'Students
have been systematically dehumanised, deemed incompetent to
regulate their own lives, sexually, politically and academically.
They are treated like commodities with a price-tag, so much raw
material to be processed for the university's
clients&#151;business, government and military bureaucracies.
Teachers have been relegated to the position of
servant-intellectuals, required, for regular promotion, to
propagate points of view in harmony with the military and
industrial leadership of our society.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The silence of responsible opinion in the face of
such calls to integrity, and ultimately even to sanity itself,
all but amounted to a scandal; and certainly a scandal wider in
its implications than any freedom movement growing up around
psychedelic drug-use, which the mass media promptly called
'abuse', and saw LSD made into a 'dirty' word, like masturbation
or VD. We couldn't simply bundle the drugs into a bag and bury
it, hoping psychedelics could all somehow be forgotten. This was
the problem&#151;what do we do with these psychedelics now that
'we' in the sense of <i>Everyman</i> have them ? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was&#151;and is&#151;a bit extraordinary, in
Britain of all places, that LSD has been rarely a subject, and
even more rarely a successful subject, for our best thinkers
(with such notable exceptions as Robert Graves on the subject of
'mushroom' visionary experience, Aldous Huxley, and Gerald Heard,
all of whom, perhaps significantly, lived abroad). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The reality of the LSD world was too random and
fragmentary for any but the most mentally flexible to identify
with it, and the unemotional 'cop-out'&#151;<i>synthesis</i>&#151;was
impossible. British intellectuals were not going to confuse the
LSD experience with <i>their</i> literary
'stream-of-consciousness' techniques for discovering the truth
about processes of deep consciousness, either&#151;you would
hardly call Tom Wolfe or James Joyce an 'acid tripper'! What they
were unwilling, or unable, to see was that acid literature and
acid thoughts are really only those ideas that deal with <i>high
level revelation, mysticism, telepathy, and transcendence of the
ego</i>. And to that extent we were a new human game and had a
message of universal interest. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The developing cult of Exploring Inwardness had
become a new truth, the stable core around which a new radical
movement would evolve. Truth and response are not a private
affair, for the truth comes to one man for all men, endowing the
recipient of it in his relation to his contemporaries with the
authority of the Prophet or of the High Priest. But men do not
willingly recognise a new voice that cries from the modern
wilderness &#133; and if they are ever at a loss for a scapegoat,
they have their man in him who would seek to remove the
distorting web of Maya, the cause of all illusions in the self. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Martin Buber, and a prophet of our time, reminds us
that, according to Hasidim, the 'teller of tales', ' &#133; the
effective exploration of the heart is the beginning of the way in
a man's life,' it is the one journey in which 'each man must find
his own way for himself'. Or such were my esoteric influences in
this period, which fed my vision of a future happier world &#133;
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thirteen cartons of books arrived at Pont Street
via the S.S. <i>Samaria</i> from America, a private importation
for which H.M. Customs required a Bill of Lading and a completed
form C.3. (Now you can't get more accurate than that). This was
our 'psychedelic stock' for this 'Operation London'&#151;300
copies of the Leary/Alpert/Metzner <i>The Psychedelic Experience:
A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead,</i> 200 issues of
<i>The Psychedelic Review</i> ed. by Drs. Weil and Metzner, and
200 copies of <i>The Psychedelic Reader</i> ed. by Gunther Weil.
It was not only that, at this time, in 1965, there was nothing
similar originating in Britain, but such literature was virtually
unobtainable here, except possibly through Bernard at Turret
Books in Kensington. It also meant that we had a Manual for
running 'guided' LSD-sessions through which we could observe the
elaboration of 'the Art' as well as various new art-forms. Now we
could conduct intensive group-sessions in which the group-mind
might participate in an ancient Tibetan ritual, and in the safety
of our own homes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All that now remained was an opportunity to use
them, which soon presented itself on the night of the first Full
Moon. (Alas, for those who do not actually <i>feel</i> the
biogenetic vibrations of a Full Moon, it must seem no more than a
pathetic, paltry, 'astronomical' phenomenon.) But for the tiny
circle of participants who asked to take part in an experience on
the <i>Bardo</i> plane, it was a night to hear mysteries which
quicken the heart, the mysterious power that makes all things new
again &#133; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were twelve of us on this spacetrip. We saw
ourselves as voyagers in search of answers to the secret of
magical self-liberation. In Tibet the responsible institution is,
or used to be, the College of Magic Ritual. Since it was
obviously impossible to duplicate any of this, we structured the
decor of the large living-room along the lines of <i>Sutra 19</i>
from the great esoteric work, the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> &#133; soon
the front room was emptied of all furnishings, except the carpet,
and we tried to have around simple, natural things to contact
during this session&#151; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>hand-woven cloth <br>
    uncarved wood<br>
    flowers&#151;growing things <br>
    ancient music<br>
    burning fire<br>
    a touch of earth <br>
    a splash of water <br>
    fruit, good bread, cheese <br>
    fermenting wine<br>
    candlelight<br>
    temple incense <br>
    a warm hand<br>
    fish swimming <br>
    anything which is over 500 years old. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We also had lots of cushions, some excellent tapes
and hi-fi equipment, a slide projector, and several chillums. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We began shortly before midnight, moving into the
new temple room with a kind of piety and seriousness you find in
acts of faith, when we all took our place in the 'Magic Circle of
Liberation'. After a short silence, we passed round the bowl
containing grapes impregnated with acid&#151;about 300
micrograms, or what is considered to be a relatively high dosage,
likely to last from between eight to twelve hours&#151;the
sympathetic discharge would follow in about forty minutes,
indicated by enlarged pupil diameter, rise in body temperature,
increased heart-rate, variable blood pressure, and sometimes a
moderate amount of physical trembling. Yet they are no stronger
on the body than the effects of a game of tennis&#151;only
thinking makes them so. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During this first period, the period of
'countdown', when the psychic energy first begins to be felt,
there is a growing sensation within of thousands of delicate
threads moving about the body, subtle lines of force which
tremble like Pampas grass, as if some thing had opened inside and
they were all streaming out. It is as though one's body is
dissolving and floating away, and the 'essence' of Me was being
liberated to join the 'essence' of everything else about me. One
feels open to a total flow, over and around and within the body,
and one becomes more and more conscious of these threads of
energy, of their vibrations, like harpstrings giving forth their
individual tones. There is something purely physical about it, a
sensation, something felt rather than recognised, a matter for
intuition, not intellect. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This sensation lasts for perhaps ten to fifteen
minutes (though one is hardly conscious of the passing of time).
Then the threads seem to collect themselves into a single vibrant
strand, circular, coiled like a snake; and then like a snake it
slowly begins to unwind, moving almost imperceptibly up the
spine, which feels like a hollow tube, gathering in force and
intensity and bathing the body in a silvery light and very, very
sensual indeed. And one's pale introspective self sits in the
boon of these tingling strings, sensitive to the least vibration
beyond time, beyond place, rocking to the motion of all that
is.... The dominant impression is that of entering into the very
marrow of self &#133; as if each of the billion atoms which
compose the body under normal circumstances is summarised and
averaged into crude, discriminate wholesale impressions which are
now able to be seen and savoured for itself. The impressions
become more intense. The vibrations turn into
colours&#151;brilliant blues, purples, and greens with dashes of
red and streaks of yellow-orange. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One gradually becomes aware of movement, a rocking
type of movement, like on the crest of a wave, yet the body does
not move at all &#133; with an overwhelming acceleration one is
turning around and around, swirling, then shuttling back and
forth like a piece of potassium on water, hissing, sparkling,
full of life and fire. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This experience may be likened to an
emotional-reflective visual kaleidoscope &#133; experiences
involving these three components keep dissolving continuously
from one pattern to another. Emotionally the patterns ranged from
serene contentment and mild euphoria to apprehension which
bordered on, but never quite slipped into, alarm. But
overwhelmingly they involved (a) astonishment at the absolutely
incredible immensity, complexity, intensity and extravagance of
being, existence, the cosmos, call it what you will; (b) the most
acute sense of the poignancy, fragility, preciousness, and
significance of all life and history. The latter is accompanied
by a powerful sense of the responsibility of all for all &#133;
intense affection for the others in the room &#133; importance
and rightness of behaving decently and responsibly&#151;of trying
to remain 'open' and cool in all areas simultaneously. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the 'guide' for this first <i>Bardo</i> session,
my job was to look after the music, the pre-recorded taped
messages from the book, and keep the participants in the flow.
The set and setting are positive, supportive, anxiety-free so
that the reaction will be ecstatic, insightful, and educational,
just as when the set and setting are clinical, experimental,
non-supportive, and impersonal, the reactions are invariably
frightening and confusing. </p>

</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shortly after dropping the acid, I played a tape of
Buddhist <i>Cakra</i> music, followed by <i>Concert Percussion</i>
by the American composer, John Cage. I then read from the
Psychedelic manual: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'O voyager<br>
    The time has come for you to seek new levels of reality. Your<br>
    ego and identity are about to cease. You are about to be set
    face<br>
    to face with the Clear Light of the Void. You are about to
    experience<br>
    it in its reality. In the ego-free state, wherein all things
    are<br>
    like the void and cloudless sky and the naked spotless
    intellect<br>
    is like a transparent vacuum; at this moment, know yourself
    and<br>
    abide in that state.<br>
    O voyager<br>
    That which is called ego death is coming to you. <br>
    Remember:<br>
    This is now the hour of death and rebirth; <br>
    take advantage of this temporary death to obtain the perfect
    state;<br>
    Enlightenment .<br>
    Concentrate on the unity of all living beings. <br>
    Hold on to the Clear Light.<br>
    Use it to attain understanding and love.<br>
    If you cannot maintain the bliss of illumination and if you
    are slipping back into contact with the external world,<br>
    Remember:<br>
    The hallucinations which you may now experience, the visions
    and insights,<br>
    will teach you much about yourself and the world.<br>
    The veil of routine perception will be torn from your eyes. <br>
    Remember the unity of all living things.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; About one hour had passed since we ingested the
drug, and we were well into the first <i>Bardo.</i> We were
beginning to confront the awesome illumination of the
metaphysical void and new energy transformations. The
instructions from the manual acted as necessary guideposts. We
were learning how to spin in neurological space. Psychedelic
equals mind-opening consciousness. Psychedelic means ecstatic,
which is to stand outside our normal patterns. It means going out
of your mind, your habitual world of contingencies, space-time
coordinates. And the key issue: 'Anything that exists outside
exists there inside'. The human brain is analogous to the
galactic one&#151;there are some ten to thirteen billion cells in
the brain, about the same number as there are stars in the
universe where the planet earth is invisible. The problem of
consciousness-expansion is the same as the external inertia to
get off this planet. The brain is 'hooked' to the external world.
Put a person into a sensory-deprivation tank for very long and he
is overcome by 'withdrawal' symptoms&#151;anxiety, tension,
physical discomfort, and paranoia. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next I played some music by Ravi Shankar and some
bossanova. Interval of fifteen minutes. Then some music by
Scriabin and part of a Bach cello suite. Interval. Some Debussy,
and Indian flute music by Ghosh. Interval. Bach organ music and
some John Cage 'space' music. Interval. The Ali Brothers and
Japanese flute music. We also looked at slides projected on to
the ceiling Tantric yantras, Vedic Gods, the Buddha, Tibetan
mandalas. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I suppose that the room in which we had gathered
would appear eccentric to most modern minds&#151;candlelight,
flames, incense, drapes flowers, bowls of fruit, but to us it all
seemed harmonious, natural and very appropriate for the
experiences we were undergoing. The session was not to be thought
of as some kind of show, a piece of theatre, an entertainment,
but a demonstration and a sharing of novel energy levels and
unusual forms of perception. And the decor was to assist the
voyager in his experience, a sort of ABC of internal language. It
was a device to help one go outside routine modes of
experiencing, beyond learned or familiar concepts, so that one
was&#151;albeit briefly&#151;no longer aware of oneself as a
social figure, but as another entity. We stood outside the
familiar self, outside parochial worlds of experience, outside
London outside the idea of being English/American/Danish. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this sense, the psychedelic experience was not
something invented by the Sandoz Chemical Company, but has been
known since Vedic times and for which an enormous literature
exists. In the West we seek to explain mind in terms of a science
called psychology, which is externally oriented towards action
and behaviours. But here one faced the fact that in the last
analysis <i>everything</i> is internal, everything happens in
your own mind. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'O friend <br>
    You may experience ego-transcendence, <br>
    Departure from your old self. <br>
    Do not cling in fondness and weakness to your old self. <br>
    Even though you cling to your mind, <br>
    you have lost the power to keep it. <br>
    You gain nothing by struggling in this hallucinatory world. <br>
    Be not attached. <br>
    Be not weak. <br>
    Go forward. <br>
    Relax. <br>
    Merge yourself with them. <br>
    Blissfully accept the wonders of your own making.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were still the instructions of the Third
Bardo to follow, and crucial to this session, because they gave
instructions on how to re-enter one's normal state of
consciousness and thus the everyday world &#133; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'O Voyager,<br>
    Now, if you wish to see the truth,<br>
    Your mind must rest without distraction. <br>
    There is nothing to do, nothing to think. <br>
    Recognise that this is the period of re-entry into the normal
    world.<br>
    Do not struggle to re-enter the denser atmosphere of routine
    game<br>
    existence. Do not attempt to use force or will-power. <br>
    Do not hold on to thoughts.<br>
    Allow the mind to rest in its unmodified state. <br>
    Meditate on the oneness of all energy.<br>
    Do not struggle to explain. Trust your guide.<br>
    Trust your companions. Trust the compassionate Buddha, <br>
    and meditate calmly and without<br>
    distraction.<br>
    Do not struggle to return. The re-entry will happen by
    itself.<br>
    Recognise where you are.<br>
    Recognition will lead to liberation.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Recognition, in this sense, does not lead to
liberation, but is liberation. He who really knows (that is to
say, vitally, not merely theoretically, with his intelligence)
that he is one with the entire universe, is beyond all fetters by
virtue of this knowledge. The world no longer binds him to it;
because, having once been above or outside ordinary existence, he
sees the things of the world differently, from a different point
of view, and they no longer possess the same power over him. This
'seeing differently' means at the same time recognition;
recognition, therefore, does not only condition, but is,
liberation. In his deepest being man is spirit, and the more he
recognises this, the more firmly he believes it, the more chains
fall away from him. Thus, it could happen that, in accordance
with the teachings of the Bardo Thodol, complete recognition
overcomes even death. All it needs is a believing soul, which is
what is meant when we talk about the power of faith. Ordinary
people will only be able to believe when they are convinced
simultaneously that the content of their faith is also
objectively real: that Krishna was really an Avatar, that the
Bible is really the Word of God, that Christ saved humanity from
death in the historical sense. The visionary, on the other hand,
knows that faith in the religious sense, and believing-to-be-true
in the scientific one, have nothing in common with each other,
that religiously it is completely indifferent whether Christ
existed or not, and that the true visionary who is spiritualized,
employs faith as he would an instrument. Ramakrishna, for
instance, was, for a while, a Christian and also a Mussulman; he
wanted to know the effect of these ideals; and in the meantime
his faith was so strong that Mahomet as well as Jesus appeared to
him in the spirit. For the rest, he kept to the worship of Kali,
the heavenly mother, as being the cult best suited to his nature,
for he knew that no one form was intrinsically adequate to
divinity. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the session we have just considered, it was
collaborative, and the planning increased the likelihood that
each person would have the sort of experience he wished. Thus his
internal freedom, his control over his consciousness is
increased. The readings from the <i>Tibetan Manual</i> were to
bring about 'recognition'; that is to remind the voyager at the
moment of ego-loss that he is prepared; to insure that he will
flow with the process trustfully. While the Buddhist language may
strike the Westerner as 'far-out', keep in mind that this is only
one of many manuals and instruction sequences from which the
prospective voyager can choose, and that the esoteric quality of
the language serves as a mnemonic device, that is, say, a sharp
memory tap so that the former instructions and resolutions can be
recalled. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If we agree that the human mind was born free but
everywhere it is in chains, it will take a miracle to free it:
because the chains are magical in the first place. We are in
bondage to authority outside ourselves; and to exorcise these
chains is the great work of magical self-liberation. And the one
way of doing this is to activate the soul. Then the eyes of the
spirit would become one with the eyes of the body, and god would
be in us, not outside. God in us: <i>entheos</i>&#151;enthusiasm:
this is the essence of the psychedelic experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how, you may wonder, shall we recognise the
individual who has thus freed himself from the bonds of
appearances, the man who has liberated himself and now walks the
earth? </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'He who returns in the flow of spirituality <br>
    Brings back a mysterious penetration <br>
    So subtle <br>
    That it is misunderstood.<br>
    Here is his appearance <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Hesitant like one who wades in a stream at
    winter <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Wary as a man in ambush <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Considerate as a welcome guest <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Fluid like a mountain stream <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Natural as uncarved wood <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Floating high like a gull <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfathomable like muddy water<br>
    How can we fathom his muddiness ?<br>
    Water becomes clear through stillness<br>
    How can we become still ?<br>
    By moving with the stream.' </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'He stands apart<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Serene<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Curiously observing<br>
    He stands quietly <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Looking forlorn <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Like an infant who has not yet<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; learned to know
    what to smile at<br>
    He is a little sad for what he sees<br>
    While others enjoy their possessions<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; he lazily drifts, homeless &nbsp; &nbsp;
    do-nothing, owning nothing<br>
    Or he moves slowly close to the land<br>
    While others are crisp and definite<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; he seems indecisive<br>
    He does not seem to be making his way in the world<br>
    He is different<br>
    A wise infant nursing at the breast of all life<br>
    Inside.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Again and again I must think of these verses from
the <i>Tao Te Ching,</i> for they remind me of so many of the
hippie voyagers I meet on the trail, who live at a different
level as the result of extraordinary internal experiences, which
alone affect men. With Jesus, they can say: I have, like my
father, all life within me. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>They are 'different'. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>milieu</i> of 'swinging London' in 1965
appeared to me like the best possible caricature of the Edwardian
world, that mighty institute for the threefold passion of
independence, indulgence, indifference, which gave soul to their
esprit and their art of living. Real love was unknown to them,
they had no serious interests of any kind- the whole of their
existence was spent in grooving, getting high, making the scene.
And yet many of them were intelligent and profound and their
profundity was not impeded by their life-style; on the contrary,
it gave them a means of expression. And for this reason the
frivolity of this period occasionally gave an impression of
gravity and profundity which struck me as being strange and made
one dream.... It was a period when people paid attention to
dress, and clothes were no less essential than their
bodies&#151;it was a means of expression, and their dressed
condition mirrored in their consciousness the outer expression
for themselves. 'By changing his clothes he changes the man
within.' The mode of dress assisted in expressing certain traits
of his being. In this way the process of dressing-up can not only
heighten or lessen the individual's power of expression: it can
indeed bring about self-realisation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How did I come to make this observation ? Shortly
after I moved into the Pont Street apartment, a couple of my
friends took me aside and suggested that I get some new clothes,
costumes of the Chelsea of the mid-sixties&#151;Edwardian
jackets, embroidered in gold and silver, and silk shirts with
huge collars, velvet pants and blue suede shoes, and so
forth&#151;and thereby prove that the spirit of this age is the
spirit of its wearer. It was a method of clothing oneself with a
certain purpose&#151;expressing certain traits of one's being
which in the ordinary course of events remain in the background.
It is a mode of dress to reveal what the individual is; it
alters, as it were, the centre of his being. Such an individual,
they argued, is more himself than he is otherwise in his 'real'
existence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, I let myself be persuaded to exchange
my jeans and sweat shirt for a new wardrobe, and Michael Rainey's
shop 'Hung On You' sent round a huge pile of fashionable clothes
and a bill for 600. There were about five of us staying at the
apartment and we divided the clothes between us. I ended up with
a pair of flared pin-stripe trousers with an enormous belt and
silver buckle, several silk shirts and ties, and a couple of
hand-embroidered jackets. Now I was at one with the fashion of my
times. The only problem was a psychological one&#151;I was
embarrassed to be seen in them and consequently I stayed indoors,
ignoring all invitations and gradually reverted back to my jeans
and sweat shirt much to the chagrin of those for whom clothes had
great significance. There was also the additional factor of the
cheque, which bounced, and I felt somehow uncomfortable wearing
these expensive clothes as a result. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My associations in this period with a select group
of young aristocrats and artists and musicians and writers,
responsible for influencing sharply the patterns of the New
Vanguard of British culture and intellectual life, was felicitous
in the extreme; but it cannot be held solely responsible for
making a revolutionary of me. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; l was certainly surrounded by a number of
high-powered anarchists. My partner, Desmond O'Brien, was already
achieving renown as one of the most far-out LSD exponents in
London and had ever been described in one publication as 'Mr.
LSD'; and our Vice-President, Joey Mellen, one of the first
persons to trepan himself, had already embarked on a career as a
priest in a new order which was to make him a distinguished
figure of great importance to English evolutionary religion. In
addition to my colleagues, associates of the World Psychedelic
Centre included such notables as Victor Lownes, who co-founded
the Playboy empire with Hugh Heffner; Julian Ormsby-Gore, the
film maker; Alex Trocchi, the philosopher-writer; Michael
O'Dwyer, the art gallery owner; Julie Felix, the singer; George
Andrews, the poet; Jo Berke, the psychiatrist working with Ronnie
Laing- Feliks Topolski, the painter; John Hopkins, the writer;
Nick Douglas, the painter; Kim Ella, the singer; Ian Sommerville,
the multi-media expert; Roman Polanski, the film maker; Bart
Hughes, the high priest of the trepanation movement; Sir Roland
Penrose, a director of the Tate Gallery; Hugh Blackwell, the
writer; as well as Roger Lewis, Billy Bolitho, Virginia Lyon,
Steve Groff, Mark Warman, Olivia de Haulleville, Shelley Cholst,
Maggie Russell, Shirley Scott James, Bill Burroughs, Bobby
Davidson, Donovan, Paul McCartney, Jim Arender, John Eason,
Nicholas Gormanstone, Christopher Gibbs, Suna Portman, and
Victoria Ormsby-Gore, all of whom made outstanding contributions
to the current London scene. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They exemplified a constellation of attitudes that
were of great importance to the cultural-artistic life of London.
They represented perhaps the seminal non-conformism of England's
mid-sixties intelligentsia&#151;not the evangelical
non-conformism of such as the Millbrook sect, but an
intellectualized form of psychedelic enlightenment, of which
popularised Learyism was largely a culmination&#151;that freed so
many of England's educated people from the rigidity of social and
class and cultural patterns which had outwardly been solidifying
into right-wing Toryism. Their rebellion was typical of this
period; the Establishment was the enemy, the representative of
the rigid patterns they felt needed to be violently rearranged. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These exotic friends were supplemented through
their contacts; and affiliations developed with such places as
St. Martin's School of Art, the Institute of Contemporary Arts,
where we conducted a 'Workshop in Consciousness Expansion', and
such literary figures as Professor Neville Coghill, Norman
Mailer, and Philip O'Connor. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet &#133; there was a problem, a
self-indulgence of mine which earned me some social suspicion, if
not also social ostracism, and which led me&#151;though against
all my instincts&#151;well over that line which divides the
normal from the abnormal. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I refer, of course, only to my taking of
methedrine. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not illegal to take methedrine, provided
that one has a prescription, signed by a registered medical
practitioner; and one could legally receive regular supplies of
this (or any other 'hard' narcotic) drug, provided that the
physician prescribes for an 'addiction'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In 1965, not only was my purchase of methedrine
legal: friends bought their heroin and their cocaine with no more
trouble than that with which they purchased their cough syrup. I
took my methedrine in the 'pure' form, as a liquid, being the
form in which the drug is most easily assimilable. And in doses
that medical descriptions of the typical methedrine-addiction
syndrome indicate to have been heavy ones, about seven injections
a day. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But that I had a serious addiction, a description
of my nervous activity makes clear: the restlessness, the ability
to work for days without adequate sleep, and even without rest at
all; the abrupt changes of mood; and the equally abrupt collapse
into somnolence not far (if at all) removed from a torpor
bordering on coma these, to those who have studied the effects of
methedrine addiction, are the unmistakable evidence of heavy and
prolonged indulgence in a powerful narcotic. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I also smoked pot and hashish constantly, and tried
every chemical I was handed. I also took acid about three times a
week and in dosages in excess of 500 micrograms. I never slept,
and after about two months I had turned myself into a sort of
zombie. Every now and then I injected myself with
dimethyl-tryptamine&#151;a fast-acting psychedelic of short
duration&#151;to jack myself back into life again. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Naturally, this 'hard' drug-taking led to a
complete disorientation of my life, which was now chaotic in the
extreme, and I spiralled further and further down until I was
caught in a mental prison of anxieties, paranoia, frictions and
most despairs of consequence. It was all very, very frightening,
and I began to think that I would remain forever hung up on an
endless chain of manic-depressive emotions. It was ironic,
really, that after all those lessons in meditation, all those
disciplines and yogic exercises those trips under LSD, those
austerities and years of metaphysical reflection, the mystic
dreams, quiet days, the idea that there was no need to <i>achieve</i>
anymore or to go about and do things and make things happen, I
was now at the mercy of a non-miraculous addiction. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In vain I tried to kick the habit, but it was
impossible, the monkey was on my back and I could not remove it.
I began to believe that it was all somehow a cosmic plot in which
I was the victim. I had nightmares which nearly scared me to
death. I reached a point where communication with other people
was impossible. I saw the whole world conspiring against me. I
was literally out of my mind and living in some kind of hell of
my own making. And, worst of all, there was no one I could turn
to for help, for there was no one I trusted; such were the
effects of this poison I injected into myself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the situation at Pont Street became more and
more unreal so much so that all my friends stopped coming round
and everyone thought I was crazy, which I was, if my behaviour
was anything to go by. That is how I appeared to them, what I was
for them&#151;a stupid, insensitive, unthinking person. What this
drug had done was to reveal the hidden monstrousness and infernal
depths within my psyche. Certainly, I made conscious efforts to
exorcise the sources of my confusion, but in vain. How would I
ever rid myself of this methedrine hell, this habit which was
killing me? I had plunged into the abyss, gone beyond my
limitations, beyond even the confines of my reason which had
served me so well. This was the land of madness, of death. How
undignified, despicable, meaningless! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet, like all addicts, I clung to my drug. I had
grown accustomed to it, I had even formed a superstitious
affection for it. I didn't want to stop my habit. One fix meant
four more hours of life another fix, four more hours of life. I
couldn't just let myself go, for this would have meant death, and
I still clung stubbornly to life. But there was a sense in which
I was already dead. The taking of methedrine implies excess of
life, intemperance, and surfeit; it is also a way of killing
yourself. This realisation accounted for the uncontrollable
terror, the panic, which gripped my soul at nightfall, when I was
alone with the alone and lost in a maze of contradictory
emotions, when I knew that my addiction was at once tragic,
dangerous, terrifying and immoral. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I was not the only one who thought so. George
Andrews, obviously disturbed by what was happening, wrote me a
letter: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Dear Michael, I have been hearing some strange stories
    about you from a lot of different people. In Tangier I
    learned to draw a very sharp line of distinction between the
    psychedelic guide, who is rare, and the psychedelic hustler,
    who is a dime a dozen. For someone with as much experience as
    you have had, to be using it the way you seem to be, you have
    in your hands the Void in crystal form, the lightning of the
    gods, the jade wine of the immortals. All the flip-outs and
    bad trips one is responsible for are added to one's daily
    load of <i>karma</i>. Why make the load even heavier? Why not
    lighten it instead?' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the advice could not be heeded. Like a poison
gas, the methedrine had become all-invading, and I knew that I
was close to death. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I ought to have known better. What a situation to
be in! The euphoria of the drug had become my refuge from the
real world. It was a barrier between myself and other people, a
wailing wall, a wall of separation. And I wondered what would
become of me. Was I a helpless puppet in the hands of some
unimaginably cruel demon, tugged and pulled on invisible strings,
but off from myself, since my innermost being was no longer in
control. What was the use of knowing mystical truths ? What help
were they now ? That I had to stop injecting toxins into my body
was obvious enough. But how must I do this? Never have I, the
wanderer, felt such pains of anguish in my soul. It seemed to me
at times as though the demon methedrine was at hand to strip my
mind of all reason. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was in the depths of despair, and anguish. Where
I should be laughing and playing, I felt horror and disgust. And
I did not understand how I had got myself into such a situation,
how my addiction was possible. The demon laughs: what is there to
understand ? It is something to like and enjoy. It is a matter of
course ! Is this the secret?&#151;I felt as though in some
mysterious manner, in some indescribable sense, I was living in a
plastic world where there was neither light nor fertility nor, on
the other hand, any wish to understand my former research after
truth. The spiritual light was extinguished in the same sudden
and mysterious way as it flashed up. The old dregs filled me up,
took me to task, threatened to weigh me down; I felt my humanity
as something alien, burdensome; worse still than that of the
helpless animal in a trap, because I knew how to question the
validity of that which was beyond my power to control. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was an impossible situation. It would never have
occurred to me a few years ago, when I first started to extend my
sensory appreciations and nervous system, that one day I should
find myself sitting in the living-room of a Belgravia apartment
trying to inject myself with 'speed'; or that if by some freaky
accident such a bizarre experience had come my way I should wish
to write about it. (Still less that my publisher would condone
such an eccentric choice of subject.) But the relation of the
individual fettered to earth through addiction with the
individual who knows the light of Brahma or Jesus or Buddha,
resembles that of the ant with the human being who crosses its
path: no matter how certain the ant is by instinct, it cannot
help itself when faced by problems which must appear
transcendental to its organism. Just so in the case of the addict
who attempts to solve the riddle of his own addition. From the
angle of reason, it is insoluble. 'Don't you see?' says a
well-intentioned friend. 'Just look at the mess you are making of
your life ! Stop ! Understand ! &#133; ' How can an addict
understand ? And even if he wants to give it up, he cannot do so.
The intentions he calls forth turn back, thoughts take flight, he
cannot grasp the totality of the experience, he is afraid of
exploding into a million bits of protoplasm. So he continues. And
to ask a psychiatrist or the local vicar to cope with your
addiction is as senseless as to ask an Indian yogi to repair a
jet aircraft. Today, neither psychiatry nor religion have much to
offer in the way of comfort or cure. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hugh, a friend of mine, also shooting speed,
came round to see me. He was desperately seeking to reassure
himself that there was some meaning to his life and that this
drug could help him find it. He had been up for the last three
nights writing his 'Journal' in which he attempted to solve the
riddle of the universe, seeing in his crazed eye previously
invisible relations and connections between words and worlds, and
himself as the sun-like source of boundless energy, ceaselessly
giving, ceaselessly pouring out words without hindrance or
resistance. He showed me a few pages from his never-ending
work-in-progress &#133; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Aquamarine light smoke the slow drift and eddy of youth
    in blue jeans and a painted face&#151;sounds like chandeliers
    drip glitter and tinkle chime pagodas&#151;Pont Street and
    Sunny South Ken sweet sounds of Donovan on a pyramid of
    people spotlit in a flurry of congas&#151;the black saint
    dressed in tribal white moans blues and mike yells lights
    hurt by the finger gleams of lunatic heads creating a collage
    of movement&#151;HEY BABY WHAT IS THIS ?&#151;it happens in
    murmurs and purple planes of light in mauve rhythms in slow
    syncopated tinsel quivers and glitters in their
    eyes&#151;blond hair&#151;stripes and fragrance <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Drugs, man ? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sure <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Likewise &#133; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It all made coherent sense to me when he read it
aloud, but I include it now as an illustration really of the
random processes of thought which occur in states of methedrine
narcosis. It was also fortunate for Hugh's reputation that, as
popular prejudice against speed began to grow&#151;and the law
began to take cognizance of that prejudice&#151;Hugh was steadily
being weaned from his habit by the undemonstrative, patient and
assiduous attentions of his girlfriend. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In my case, three events occurred to shake me out
of any feelings of indifference. The first was a telephone call
from Texas telling me that Leary had been found guilty of
transporting three ounces of marijuana across the Laredo-Mexican
border as well as failing to pay taxes on it and had been fined
$40,000 and given the maximum sentence of thirty years in jail.
'That s the same what Prometheus got,' the lawyer added, somewhat
casually. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The second was a half-page advertisement in the
London <i>Evening Standard:</i> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'LSD&#151;THE DRUG THAT COULD THREATEN LONDON. Just for
    kicks, some famous artists, pop stars, and debs are
    &quot;taking a trip&quot; on LSD&#151;one of the most
    powerful and dangerous drugs known to man. It produces
    hallucinations. It can cause temporary insanity. Kicks like
    this may be bought at the appalling cost of psychotic illness
    or even suicide. It is banned in America and
    elsewhere&#151;but is still available in London, quite
    legally. Still more appalling&#151;just half an ounce of LSD
    could knock out London. Socially, the stuff is dynamite. <i>London
    Life</i> magazine has investigated LSD fully and has
    uncovered a social peril of magnitude which it believes
    demands immediate legislation &#133; to stop the spread of a
    cult which could bring mental lethargy and chaos. <i>London
    Life</i> reporters have also traced the man who calls himself
    Mr. LSD. He has given them an astonishing series of
    interviews. Read all about him, and about LSD, in this week's
    <i>London Life.'</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. LSD was of course our President, Desmond
O'Brien, and believe it or not&#151;the reporter was Hugh, whose
mind, as I have already indicated, was racing ahead of itself
into the higher realms of associative paranoia due to methedrine
poisoning. When I telephoned Hugh about all of this, he said that
he had been so stoned that he had told the story of what was
going on at the World Psychedelic Centre to the <i>London Life</i>
editor who was, as it happened, the reporter who first broke the
Profumo-Keeler scandal. 'This thing is bigger than the Keeler
story,' he had told Hugh. But of course it was too late for me to
do anything. There were even advertisements on
television&#151;spirals of colour in and out of focus and a voice
saying 'LSD&#151;the drug that could turn on London. Read the
exclusive story in next week's <i>London Life.'</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the third and final straw was an article in the
Sunday tabloid, <i>The People,</i> that was headed in one-inch
lettering. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'THE MEN BEHIND LSD&#151;THE DRUG THAT IS MENACING YOUNG
    LIVES.... The drug is LSD-25&#151;Lysergic Acid diethylamide.
    It is by far the most dangerous drug ever to become easily
    obtainable on the black market. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; LSD, which is said to give &quot;visions of
    heaven and hell&quot; is used legitimately by psychiatrists
    to produce carefully controlled hallucinations. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In the wrong hands, the hallucinations it
    produces can lead to utter irresponsibility, disregard for
    personal safety and suicidal tendencies. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; IT IS, IN FACT, A KILLER DRUG. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; We have obtained evidence of &quot;LSD
    parties&quot; being held in London. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; We have discovered an alarming group of people
    who are openly and blatantly spreading the irresponsible use
    of this terrible drug. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; These men run what they call the Psychedelic
    Centre. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; It has operated from a number of addresses,
    including one in St. James's Street, and a flat in Pont
    Street, Chelsea. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst the Centre's activities is the
    publication of a handbook called <i>A Psychedelic Manual.</i>
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; This lists recommended doses of LSD and other
    drugs and antidotes, and contains a treatise on drug-induced
    hallucinations and other &quot;benefits&quot;. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The manual gives various reasons for the use of
    drugs such as LSD. These include: &quot;For personal power
    &#133; for &#133; fun &#133;for sensuous enjoyment &#133;
    &quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The manual which is written by &quot;B.
    Goldstein&quot;, says the taking of LSD and similar drugs
    offers &quot;a release from our conditionings&quot; and
    &quot;senses become more acute&quot;. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Recommending group sessions of drug-taking, the
    writer says: &quot;A person should approach the experience
    with love and trust in the company of those he trusts.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;A psychedelic experience lasts normally
    from eight to sixteen hours &#133; but the results may last
    from several days to several months. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The voyager should set aside at least two
    days for the experience itself.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; This is irresponsible, dangerous gibberish. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The Centre was deserted and in a state of
    considerable chaos when our investigators gained entry on
    Thursday. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; There were used hypodermic syringes, empty drug
    ampoules and a variety of pills. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Among the litter of papers were dozens of phone
    numbers, some of them of well-known show-business stars and
    personalities.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A 'paranoid', according to Bill Burroughs, is
someone who has some idea of what is really going on. In this
sense you could say that I was a 'paranoid'. I had read the
newspapers and realised that my time was up, that the police
would now be on to me, so I split London for the country, though
with little or no idea of where I should go or what I would do. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I rented a car through Hertz and set off for the
North, to Durham to be exact, arriving there late one evening,
and very, very stoned indeed. I still had several dozen ampoules
of methedrine, about two ounces of hashish and a similar quantity
of good grass. I spent a couple of days in Durham retracing
familiar places of my early childhood, visiting family and
generally grooving around. London seemed a memory only as I
wandered the narrow streets and alleyways surrounding the
Cathedral, a place that had become somehow unreal in my
imagination, a place I did not wish to return to. But in my
paranoid state (one of the real dangers of modern life), I began
to suspect that the Durham police were on my heels, so I left as
suddenly as I came, this time for Yorkshire and the open moors. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the next three days I just drove and drove and
drove, staying at country hotels and leaving early in the
morning. I think I must have clocked up 2000 miles since leaving
London. My drug intake had also increased, so much so that there
were times I had to park the car because I could not see the
road&#151;my vision was blurred and distorted, and I had
difficulty remembering how to change the gears or which pedal was
the brake and which was the clutch. My paranoia level also
increased and to such a degree that I thought I was being
followed by the police (such are the delusions of the advanced
methedrine-taker, who sees danger even in shadow). But the most
amazing experience occurred on the fourth night. I was cruising
through the lanes and by-ways of the Lake District in the early
hours; there was no traffic on the roads and the countryside was
still and motionless, when, suddenly, the mirror lit up and I
experienced a sort of panic. Police. It could only be the police
at this time of the night, and they had somehow got on to me. I
immediately accelerated and sped through the lanes like an
express train, swerving round corners, darting through empty
villages &#133; but still the light in the mirror. I could not
shake my pursuer, probably a cop specially trained at the Police
Driving School, I reflected. Faster and faster I sped. And still
the light in the mirror. Sheer panic. I was trembling all over.
Terror gripped my soul. I was like an animal being chased by a
pack of dogs, with no hole to dive into. Then I saw an open
farmyard, and turning into it, I drove through the potted yard
until I came to a narrow path overgrown with grass. But it was
straight and somehow I managed to keep on the path. I must have
driven three or four miles along this bumpy grassy path when the
headlights picked up a gate blocking the path, and for a moment I
was tempted to accelerate and smash my way through it, as they
seem to be able to do in the cheaper American movies. But I
stopped, and very fortunately so, because when I got out of the
car to open this 'gate' I discovered that it was a barrier fence
with a drop of about 100 feet to a river below. And that the
'path' was not a path at all but a disused railway track with the
railway lines removed. My next discovery was equally
surprising&#151;the 'light' I had been picking up in my mirror
and which I had believed was the light beam of a pursuit
police-car was only the reflection of a full moon ! I was being
chased by the moon. And it was this extraordinary hallucination
that brought me back to some kind of sanity again, and I slowly
backed my way to the farmyard and on to the road again, where I
parked the car and fell asleep, thankful that I had had such a
lucky escape from certain death. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At dawn, when my head was a little clearer, I
decided that I had had enough of this fantasy existence and, at a
leisurely speed, drove back to London and to my flat in Pont
Street. Strange! Back in the face of this flaming world I am
reminded of the serenity of the Buddha. And my mad car ride was
like a dream, induced by all the drugs; I had been to hell, but
the flames had done me no damage; they were as harmless as
shadows. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &#133; A new dawn breaks. Once more, as on the
first day of creation, I am born. The laughing moon, insecure and
pale, hurries away from the flaming sun in a sweeping curve. The
silver has changed into a dull red. The black background which
but a few hours ago threatened to absorb me, reveals itself now
as a grey crust of dross. And I am back in reality once more. A
thought strikes me: must addicts all contend with a nisus to
self-destruction ? In my case, it is only bad temper that keeps
me going &#133; the blessing of <i>Siva. Bom! </i> </p>

<h4>Six accused in Chelsea drugs case</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Arrested at a flat in Pont Streets Chelsea, yesterday
    evening, an artist, writer, physician, company director and
    an art dealer and his wife were each remanded on 100 bail
    until March 18 at Marlborough Street today. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; All were charged with unauthorised possession
    of cannabis sativa (Indian Hemp). They are: <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Joseph Chase Hunt Mellen, 25, writer; John
    Laurence Doyle, 29, art director; and Mrs Monica Doyle, 23,
    all of Pont Street; Sheldon Cholst, 41, American physician
    and author of Pembridge Square, Bayswater; Mark Anthony
    Warman, 21, company director, of Bywater Street, Chelsea; and
    Michael John Hollingshead, 34, artist, and occupier of the
    flat, who was also accused of permitting it to be used for
    smoking cannabis.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Being busted is like going bald. By the time you
realise it is happening it is too late to do very much about it.
So one tries to minimise the consequences as best one can, though
of course the damage is already done. Later, perhaps, it may even
become one of those stories that, suitably edited, you tell
against yourself&#133; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No one was particularly surprised when the police
raided my flat. The place was a centre for all kinds of
psychedelic experimentation, and it was only a matter of time
before someone complained or turned me in. There had been a
number of 'incidents' surrounding the history of this flat, such
as a party attended by some eighty guests who got accidentally
turned on via a spiked fruit-and-wine punch, amongst whom were
some police spies masquerading as hippies. There was also the
problem of noise since the speakers were seldom off, always
playing at full volume. Yet despite all this, I observed the
scene with complete indifference; I was in any case unable or
unwilling to do very much about it. It was an oversight I was to
'learn to regret', as the saying goes. Indeed, yes, it was, for I
had not expected anything quite so serious as it subsequently all
turned out. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think this was due in part to the fact that Leary
himself had been busted in Laredo, Texas, only a short time
before the police in London got after me. Tim had been passing
through Laredo on his way to Mexico with his daughter, Susan, and
his son, Jackie, and Susan had a small stash of grass hidden in
her brassiere, which the American customs found. Tim did the only
thing a parent could do under such circumstances, he admitted
that the grass was his and that he knew where it had been hidden.
The Texan judge sentenced him to thirty years' imprisonment. And
Susan got off. The American Establishment had got their man. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this left me in a somewhat difficult situation
in London, for the plan had been that Tim would join me before
Easter for a big Psychedelic Rally, possibly even at the Albert
Hall, with pop musicians, poets and members of the British
underground taking part. I had come on ahead to set it up, and,
like a juggler, I had several things suspended in mid-air at any
one time in the sure knowledge that when Tim came he would be
able to act as my 'apologist' and catch them. Now that he was
unable to leave America, l suddenly found everything tumbling
about my head. My world had come crashing down and I was unable
or strangely unwilling to do much about it. I simply let events
take their course, that's all. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was difficult to explain any of this to either
the judge or the jury. The 'politics of ecstasy' was a completely
foreign world to them, and one moreover they seemed to equate
with drug-taking of the very worst kind. l had also violated the
law. I was now liable for a penalty of ten years' imprisonment
and a fine of 1000. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet despite the seriousness of the charges and the
fact that I would almost certainly be found guilty, I treated the
whole matter as an exercise in breathtaking intellectual
negligence. It seemed to me that the whole purpose of the British
legal system, with its roles and rules and rituals, is to
convince you that, by its gravity and seriousness, it knows
better than you do. And it was through this insight that I
decided to defend myself rather than have a barrister do it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had also taken some LSD before arriving at court,
which enhanced the unreality of the scene, myself high in the
witness box on a charge of getting high, the judge in his robes
and wig, the jury banked in rows like eggs, a gallery filled with
plain and faceless men, and I saw myself as an actor in a
B-movie. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was one exchange I remember; it was during my
cross-examination of a Detective Sgt. Dalton of the London Flying
Squad, who had arrested me in the first place. The case had begun
to drag a little. The witnesses&#151;for the
prosecution&#151;were uniformly serious in their evidence. They
all made me look like some kind of horrible pervert who took
non-prescription drugs as for themselves it would be, say, whisky
or beer. The scene had become 'heavy'. Now that Dalton was in the
witness-box, I could try to lighten the proceedings a little, and
addressing myself to him, I asked him to tell the court what he
had done when he first entered the bathroom, where the marijuana
had been found. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I went over to the toilet-bowl,' he replied. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Very good, you went over to the toilet-bowl,' I
said, carefully lowering my voice so that it was almost a
whisper. 'And did you see anything in there ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Excuse me, but I didn't hear the question.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I raised my voice slightly: 'Did you see anything
when you looked into the toilet-bowl ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Yes. I saw some leaves of what I believed to be <i>cannabis
sativa</i> floating on the surface of the water.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'So,' I said, my voice in rising crescendo, 'you
saw some grass floating about in the toilet. Well, isn't that a
good place for it, then&#151;<i>in the toilet-bowl?'</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I thought it was a good joke, and inoffensive, but
I was told later that it had probably cost me an extra six months
on my sentence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As it was, I was unprepared for the
sentence&#151;twenty-one months for less than an ounce of hashish
and a negligible amount of marijuana. It seemed altogether too
long and I must have just stood in the dock in utter amazement,
for the next thing I knew was being grabbed on both sides and
propelled down the staircase to the cells under the court, there
to await the Black Maria or something, to take me and the other
new prisoners to Wormwood Scrubs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When my name was finally called, I was brought out
and handcuffed and put in the van. And it was a strange sensation
to observe London through the grillwork and glass, handcuffed,
and coming down off a trip. It also happened that the van
actually drove past my old flat, and I wondered how I would have
reacted if a few weeks earlier someone had said that one day I
would be passing the place under the exact circumstance I
described. It was all very curious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon enough, however, we reached the Scrubs, a huge
mausoleum of a place that could have been built as a Victorian
factory, with high walls and gothic towers, dustbin-dirty in the
way of railway stations, and rife with the smell of incontinence
of urine. I felt as if I were entering the bowels of the earth. I
don't think that I have ever been quite so depressed as I was for
those first few minutes in prison. My soul turned grey, if such a
thing is possible. I felt drained of all light in this
netherworld place in which it was impossible to imagine how
anything had ever been young or beautiful. My sensibilities
simply turned themselves off in the face of this monstrous
universe. I could have been a stick a stone, a zombie, for here
there were none who could emphathise with my plight. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But after a night's sleep, my heart began to
revive, and my curiosity about my unknown daily routine got the
adrenalin working. There was also the novelty of getting into my
new prison clothes&#151;a striped shirt with a black tie, socks
about quarter of an inch thick, a pair of trousers and
military-style jacket made of thick material, and a pair of heavy
marching boots. Nothing fitted properly, of course. Oh, I felt
like a walking scarecrow, which was probably the intention
anyway. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had no sooner got dressed than the landing
officer unlocked the cell and told me to go down and get
breakfast. The noise in the hall and passageways was quite
deafening, redolent with the sound of male voices, hoots of
laughter, crashing metal and bells. It was like living inside a
huge alarm-clock, I reflected, as I made my way down the narrow
iron staircase to the main hall. Prison is one huge sensory
deprivation tank, an incredible human vault that echoes to the
least footfall. It is a way of life to suit a sort of monk. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Breakfast consisted of a plate of watery porridge,
a couple of table-spoon measures of milk, a dry sausage, as much
bread and marge as you could eat, and a mug of tea. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After breakfast, I was told to go back to my cell
where I would be called during the morning to see the Governor
who liked to meet each new charge. He would also allocate my
work. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My cell was not very big. The walls had been
painted a sickening pink, the colour of corned beef, and the cell
door was a bright green. Light entered through a barred window
recessed some two feet into the wall. There was a table, a plank
hard chair, a bed, and a metal chamberpot. To look out of the
window you had to stand on the table, and it was possible to
discern in the distance beyond the high prison wall the contours
of the city, to look out nostalgically at all the lightness of
heart and foot going past in the park, never knowing for sure
whether you would ever rejoin it. This is something of what it
means to be a prisoner. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The morning passed with monstrous slowness. A
prison sentence is a certain fixed period of enforced idleness.
Things&#151;I was to learn&#151;have their own momentum of
realizability. You can rush your life on the outside by the
scruff of its neck, but in prison everything happens according to
the rules. It is a permanent 'working to rule', you might say;
rushing anything would be like trying to rush a stalactite. So
one needs to be philosophical about the slowness of it all and
develop the necessary mental and physical yogas to overcome
inertia, impatience and boredom. It's not so strange this world
as so different. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like most new inmates, I suppose, I went through
quite a few mental changes during those first few days. They were
appallingly difficult. My head was ambushed by depression and
stagnation, and it seemed that I was beset with all sorts of
cares, existential longings to be free again, angst. I think that
to be locked up without freedom&#151;that is, without access to
love&#151;is something you have to adapt yourself to, for man
cannot live by bread alone. We like to think it. And of course we
should, but we really cannot, you know. Individual human life
needs the closeness of another body, a warm hand or look, the
occasional kiss and merging with another. The inhuman regimen of
prison existences does not allow for spontaneity with joy, but
dictates a certain style of living in a prescribed manner, always
to form, always to rules accepted as facts. It is indeed an
experience of so-called reality. I continue to be amazed that
there are so few suicides, singly or even on mass scale, a
reaction to the tyranny of a system that allows bodies of men to
press on the bodies of men, and usually for so little reason. But
with patience and the passing of time, the mind-body adapts
itself, trying as best it can to keep a little flame of humanity
alight in the dark, womanless silence, and later, even achieve a
simple affirmation of the world. You must or otherwise you would
die. So you live on in the hopefulness that once beyond these
walls your heart will quicken and your tongue renew. I think
prison is really dedicated to the idea that we should think of
ways in which to bring each other down not up, and is thus the
antithesis of the aims of our new 'psychedelic revolution'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When the Governor finally sent for me, I was taken
to the main administration block, and told to remove my shoes
before entering his office. I saw the reason for this when I went
inside. The Governor sat at a desk about fourteen feet from where
I stood. We were separated by glossy linoleum as smooth and as
slippery as an ice-rick. It seemed that inmates were sometimes in
the habit of reacting violently to the Governor's decisions, and
this (almost) foolproof method protected him from assault. He had
of course nothing to fear in that way from myself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Chief Prison Officer gave my number and name to
the Governor, who looked up and asked me if I had ever been to
prison before. 'No, but I've worked in a prison.' 'In this
country ?' the Governor asked. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'No, in America, at a maximum security prison. I
was with a group of people from Harvard who used to run LSD
sessions for some of the inmates&#151;revelation followed by
reformation, that sort of stuff.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Yes, I see. Now, it seems you were charged with
possession of dangerous drugs. And that is why you are here now.
It seems a pity that someone like yourself who is obviously
well-educated and literate should find consolation in drugs. How
is such a thing possible ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like the New York call-girl from Radcliff who is
asked how a nice girl like her came to be in such an occupation,
I replied 'Just lucky, I guess.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Governor also expressed concern about what work
to give me. He finally settled on the steam laundry. And I was
told to report there after lunch. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The chief laundry officer was an amiable sort of
man who had been at the same job for twenty years. He began by
showing me around the laundry. There were huge steam rollers and
presses, washers and dryers, ironing rooms and drying rooms, and
about thirty prisoners variously engaged in keeping the flow of
laundry moving at maximum speed, or so it seemed at the time. He
then showed me what I had to do. My job carried 'a lot of
responsibility'; I was on the reception desk, and I had to check
in and check out all the laundry and to see that what came in
also tallied with what went out. A simple enough job on the face
of it. There was one snag, however: the nurses' laundry. It could
happen, if one didn't watch the articles like a hawk, that
brassieres and panties simply 'disappeared' at some stage on the
way through the various laundry processes. And a number of such
articles often found their way back to the cells. My main job,
the officer told me, was to see that this didn't happen. There
was also a complicated system of record keeping, which was
explained to me, but my brain couldn't embrace all the details
and I simply 'tuned out' halfway through the hour-long laborious
explanation by the officer. The result was that by the end of the
third day the laundry was besieged with complaints, particularly
from the nurses' home, which reported nearly a dozen panties
missing and several brassieres. There were also complaints from
the long-term prisoners, for whom clean laundry was one of the
few remaining pleasures, who were understandably impatient that
their bespoke shirts or specially fitted trousers had not been
returned. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was transferred to the ironing room and told to
iron shirts. Here again I seemed to get things cocked or somehow
not quite right. And this time the complaints were that shirts
were coming back from the laundry with big burn marks, missing
buttons, and twisted collars. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Once more I found myself standing shoeless before
the Governor. I had not been charged with negligence or
insubordination, but the implication was there. I was given a
'second chance' and transferred to the book bindery, which is
considered something of a plum of a job at Wormwood Scrubs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The book bindery is run by a civilian, and it is
quiet. In appearance it resembled a Dickensian solicitor's
office, with high tables and chairs and strained faces buried in
piles of books. I was put in the paperback section to be trained
in the craft of hard-cover binding, a job by which none would be
particularly impressed but requiring a certain amount of manual
skill, nonetheless. The civilian supervisor told me in this
connection that book-binding required three things: 'The first is
dexterity, the second is dexterity, and the third is dexterity.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was glad to be away from the old steam laundry
and was quite enjoying my new job when another one of those
unwritten minor tragedies occurred. I had left a foot-high stack
of books in the press; the new covers had been glued on and the
idea was to let them dry overnight. This was the culmination of a
week's work, and I was naturally excited to see how the finished
products looked in the morning. The civilian supervisor came over
with me to unscrew the press and see what kind of a job I had
made on my first assignment. He began to turn the handle; and his
dismay was equal to my own, for all the bindings had stuck
together with the result that the books rose as one, in
concertina fashion, and then crashed on to the floor, sending
loose pages all over the place. The civilian supervisor stood for
a moment, his mouth wide open, and then said very, very slowly,
and with great pathos: 'Good God! Good God! Good God!' (I was
with him on the first two all right, but he lost me on the
third.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That was the end of my stay in the book bindery. A
complaint was made to the Governor who immediately despatched me
to a foetid factory building to sew mailbags, the final
degradation, no doubt, for after mailbags there is nowhere
further down the work rung to go, except possibly being a waiter
in the Prison Officer's Mess. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the slowness of the Himalayan range, it
seemed, my average uneventful days passed into routinely ordinary
weeks. There had been quite a bit of news about hash and LSD in
the daily Press, mainly about people getting busted, so that by
the beginning of the summer quite a few of my friends were inside
with me&#151;Nick Douglas, the painter; Hugh Blackwell, the
writer; Hugh Lansdowne, the poet; Pat Ryan, the musician; Robert
Fraser, the art gallery owner; and John Hopkins, one of the
editors of the <i>International Times</i> of whom Christopher
Logue wrote in his poem: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Mistakes like mine occur<br>
    Bored with the cosy spiral of my galaxy<br>
    I went off limits<br>
    And time slammed around me like<br>
    The door into a pillar box.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And there were to be several hundred more
'psychedelic' inmates in British jails before the year was out. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Press was having a field-day on the topic. Pot
and LSD were the new twin menaces of our Western kind of society,
evils which had to be stamped out. 'At least 100,000 more Britons
will take psychedelic drugs this year in spite of new provisions
in the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1966,' said one headline, and went
on to say that this figure was the result of twelve-month
nationwide survey conducted by a Dr. Jim Marle, the Atlantic
psychiatrist, at a meeting in Oxford. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact this was more likely to happen <i>because</i>
of the provisions in the Dangerous Drugs Act. Restrict anything
and immediately people want it. There must be thousands of
readers now buying grass and LSD who would never have done so but
for articles of this kind; and quite a few I daresay now believe
that LSD is compulsory, like vaccination or fluoridation Besides,
total prohibition has never worked. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet drugs is a subject that can never come under
discussion without so much emotion that rational argument becomes
obscured if not totally banished. The Press, and to some extent
publishers as well, seem to delight in touching people where they
are most vulnerable&#151;producing articles and books which
threaten the incredulous and the superstitious. Whenever one of
these articles or books appears in public they set off a chain of
articles or letters, each more heated than the last. This is
possible because the problems concerned with drugs are not
susceptible to single convulsive solutions. It is as though where
questions of morality come in that detachment quits the scene. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And often the Press would slant a particular piece
so that not even an idiot reader could miss the point. One
example comes to mind, also from this period in the mid-sixties.
It is from the now defunct <i>Daily Sketch.</i> It showed a
photograph of Leary, smart and serious in a suit, deep in
conversation with the reporter. The article was headed 'I'll Turn
On Britain, says the leader of the Drug Church'. And Leary is
then quoted as saying: 'I don't imagine I shall run into as much
opposition for my religion in Britain as I have here in the
States. The British are more tolerant and have a sense of
humour.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The question of drugs inside the prison was also a
matter of some concern, for as the 'psychedelic' inmate
population rose, and as other prisoners became cognizant of the
phenomena LSD and hashish, there was a corresponding increase in
their availability. Many ways were used to get psychedelics in,
from felt-tip pens stuffed with Red Lebanese to bunches of grapes
spiked with acid. I myself had a reasonably steady supply of
hashish, and a stash of LSD which Richard Alpert and Owsley had
left during their visit to the Scrubs. There was very little if
anything the prison authorities could do to stop it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Naturally, I would often be approached by other
prisoners to tell them something about these drugs, or they
simply wanted to score. And as a general rule, I would share any
hashish I might happen to have, whilst refusing to give them LSD,
that is, unless they were already pretty experienced in using it.
There were exceptions, however, most notable of these being
George Blake, the spy then serving a sentence of forty-three
years' imprisonment. He had served about five years of his
sentence when I met him. And it was not long before we were
having long discussions about 'turning on'; and he said he would
like to try it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We decided to run a session on the Sunday, when the
cells in 'D' Hall are left open all afternoon and one can roam at
will about the landings without supervision. Blake's cell was on
the ground floor, comfortably furnished with a carpet and
curtains, a bookcase stuffed with books and, on the table, a
short-wave radio, which he had somehow acquired in order 'to
listen to Arabic language stations'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing much happened for the first hour. But as
the session developed, Blake became quite tense, a nervous strain
verging on complete paranoia, and seemed to believe that I was a
Secret Service agent who had administered him a truth serum. He
told me that I'd be killed within the next twenty-four hours, and
made other similar threats. I felt quite baffled as to what to
do, so I did nothing, merely listened as he went through his
flip-out, and tried to reassure him by means of treating the
whole affair as if it were all somehow something quite ordinary
strewn into the everyday, though secretly I was quite alarmed in
case a prison officer happened to look in and hear what was going
on. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He finally settled down, however, and the last
couple of hours were spent in deep thought and quiet reflection
concerning his future existence, and he said he might not be able
to stand up to many more years of incarceration. I suggested
they'd probably let him out on parole in a few years' time, but
he doubted this. He felt that he was in prison as a living
warning to others who might be similarly tempted. But I said that
was an old clich, and had never worked anyway. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As it happened, Blake escaped only a few weeks
after the session, by scaling the wall one Sunday afternoon by
means of a rope-ladder thrown over by an accomplice, who had been
in touch with him via the short-wave radio in his cell. When I
last heard about him, he was living in Moscow and working for the
Cairo Section of the Russian Foreign Ministry. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I had been at Wormwood Scrubs for about four
months when I was asked about going to an 'open prison' at
Leyhill, near the English-Welsh border. I said I'd prefer the
country. And shortly after this interview, I was transferred to
Leyhill Prison. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leyhill was in some sense a reprieve from the
double-dense monotony of a 'closed' prison like the Scrubs, where
no-life and all-life hang precariously together there. Here in
the country one could not only see the beauty of the natural
landscape but also feel it, and I am eternally grateful to
whoever it was who got me there. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon arrival, I was taken to the kitchen and given
a dinner of fried eggs, bacon, beans and chips, freshly baked
rolls and butter some cake, and coffee. The Duty Officer told me
that there were some 450 inmates and two night guards, that there
were no walls or fences surrounding the prison, and that anyone
was free to escape at any time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was then shown into a dormitory of about fourteen
people and given a bed and bedside locker. Pat Ryan, the
musician, occupied the bed on my right, and Jerry, a singer and
lyricist, the one on my left. They had both been busted for
hashish. A couple of others in the dormitory had also been
similarly busted for possession, and not a few of the ordinary
prisoners were starting to smoke. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was called to meet the Governor the next morning.
He was an amiable, elderly Scot, who managed our meeting very
well. He told me that this was his retirement year, that his wife
was dying of cancer, and that he was a lover of Robert Burns and
Ella Wheeler Wilcox. He suggested that I join both the bridge
club and the debating club, help start a flying club, and apply
for a course in fish ecology at nearby Bristol University, all of
which I subsequently did. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My first job at Leyhill was as a waiter at the
Prison Officers' Training School, which was sited in the former
Earl of Ducy's estate and house, next to the prison. It was a
good job as it meant in effect that one ate civilian food, which
made quite a change from the plain prison fare. And the work was
far from boring. I would wait on about four tables at which would
be four trainee prison officers attending their eight-week
induction course. I was probably the first live prisoner they had
ever seen. And it was interesting to observe their reactions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My initial approach would never vary. I'd meet them
at the table on their first day, extend my hand to each one, and
welcome them individually. By the end of the second day they all
knew why I was in prison. And by the end of the week, our
conversation was generally about ways to get high. Some of the
groups were quite generous, and would slip me the occasional
bottle of wine. Some let me use their billiard room. Some even
said they were looking forward to meeting me again at some point
in my future, when they would see that I got an easy deal. They
were a pleasant crowd, by and large, mostly respectable
working-class, who needed some kind of job with tenure in order
to keep their game going. It was a job. It gave financial
security. It made their respectability possible. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Life at Leyhill had a particular flavour all its
own. Physically, the layout was perfect. There was a huge sports
ground with cricket, rugby, and soccer pitches, running tracks,
and places to fly your kite. The Ducy estate contained an
arboretum filled with trees and bushes from every part of the
world, a constant delight to both mind and eye. There was one
tree in particular I was attracted to. It was Japanese and, I
believe, magical, whose flowering one spring turned me on to the
plant kingdom. The exquisite beauty of this tree was like a
window in which you could see the existence of this Other World.
And it was a point of routine for me to spend most of my lunch
time smoking praises for Shankar in the half-lotus position under
the boughs of this holy tree. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the highlights of my stay at Leyhill was the
production of a physio-psychedelic musical called <i>Paradise
Lost &#151; The True Story,</i> which had been sent to me by Joey
Mellen, friend and former associate from Pont Street, who had
decided that the best way to stay permanently 'high' was by
trepanning a hole in his head the size of the old sixpenny piece.
The play was a strange mixture of Milton and Mellen, with lyrics
in praise of trepanation or 'getting the hole'. I reproduce one
of the songs below, called 'The Great Brain Robbery': </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>THE GREAT BRAIN ROBBERY<br>
    By Joe Mellen </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Up stood the ape&#151;down came the drag&#151;<br>
    The beginning of the blues&#151;<br>
    Can't talk your way out of it adult <br>
    Daddy there's a drag on you. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Oh adult the mistakes you make <br>
    You ignorant little man <br>
    Adult oh the liberties you take <br>
    You mistaken little man. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Between your meals you make your deals <br>
    And send your sons to war <br>

    We've heard it all before. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Adult will you never see<br>
    All you want is to agree&#151;<br>
    The lies you tell to save your face <br>
    Constitute your grave disgrace. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>You're losing and you think you're gaining <br>
    It's just your ego needs maintaining <br>
    Adult d'you know what is true ? <br>
    The drag is bearing down on you. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>What you're trying to regain <br>
    Is blood belonging to your brain <br>
    Will you know before you're dead <br>
    That paradise is in your head ?<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You was robbed&#151;so you made belief&#151;<br>
    It's gravity&#151;we've caught the thief <br>
    All you prayers won't save your soul <br>
    Adult you need a hole. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another song, called 'Brainbloodvolume', has been
set to music by Julie Felix in her furthest-out number yet. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>BRAINBLOODVOLUME </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It was lost and now it's found again <br>
    Don't drive it underground again <br>
    Brainbloodvolume&#151;<br>
    They call it love and heaven above <br>

    It's you it's me it's good <br>
    Understood ? <br>
    Brainbloodvolume. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's what the poets have written for <br>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; Priests have prayed for <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Prisons have filled for <br>

</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was necessary to approach the Governor to obtain
permission to stage it in the prison theatre, perhaps even before
an invited audience of students from Bath and Bristol
universities. I decided to plug the Milton section at the expense
of the rest, feeling that the Governor would be more sympathetic
to it than the modern additions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Governor was most attentive during my outline
of the play, and wrote a memo to the Prison Chaplain that he
should consider staging it one Sunday in the Church. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, I met with the Chaplain, a nice,
easygoing man with a strong sense of Christian vocation, who had
been at Leyhill for four years and had a good understanding of
prisoner psychology. I introduced the matter by suggesting that
there is a mystery in the story of <i>Paradise Lost</i> that lies
at the heart of all our lives. And this is older than that of
Oedipus. In the play there are overtones of the great four
stories of the world's various religions, and specifically of the
Hebrew-Christian tradition. Guilt and Sin are pretty powerful
themes of the Christian Church, and any attempt to understand
their place in the world and their relevance to contemporary man
was, I assured him, a matter of concern to today's criminal. One
begins by depicting man as some kind of &quot;hairless talking
ape&quot; who is unable to benefit from the possibilities of his
own existence, who then has a revelation, in this instance,
through piercing a small hole through his skull to increase the
volume of blood to the brain. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Chaplain looked puzzled. 'But what has <i>Paradise
Lost</i> got to do with making holes in your head ?' he asked. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Well, the theory is that by increasing the amount
of blood to the brain the surface of the
capillaries&#151;millions of them&#151;increases, which in turn
release glucose from the blood into the brain cells. This is the
physiological secret of &quot;getting high&quot;. So the
&quot;hairless talking ape&quot; who does not know that his
&quot;fall&quot; (loss of brainbloodvolume) has a purely
physiological cause. Thus he lives out his simple life or death
without ever realising his golden future, truly the parable of
fallen man.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'It sounds all rather godless to me.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Well, the modern writer uses myths and metaphors
in order to get his message across. And in the case of this play,
he has found modern counterparts to the story of the Fall in
poetry, science, and music to express an awareness that we all
have, however obscurely, that there are vast capacities in man
which he continually fails to realise. The message of the play is
simple. If things are not right inside yourself, then change
them. The evolutionary leap in being from monkey to man produced
a new kind of animal, a creative animal, an animal with
imagination, who could devise ways to regain the lost paradise of
lost brainbloodvolume.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But why trepanation ?' the Chaplain persisted. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Because trepanation offers a solution on a
manageable scale.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'A solution to what ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'A solution to the problem of staying
&quot;high&quot;.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But what has staying &quot;high&quot; got to do
with putting on a musical play in my Church?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'The Governor and I thought that because of the
religious themes you might&#133; ' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But I find the whole thing utterly
&quot;godless&quot;, and I could never allow such a production to
be shown. And now that you have explained it to me, I doubt
whether I could allow it to be performed in the theatre.
Prisoners are very suggestible you know, and we could not risk
wholesale trepanations. It is just what the <i>Daily Express</i>
are looking for. I really think, Hollingshead, that you ought to
concentrate instead on more practical plans for your own future
than try to launch a social movement based on people putting
holes in their heads. Have you ever considered the profession of
the church ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I'm sorry you don't like the play. I thought you
would. What we are seeing today is merely the visible aspect of a
universal neurosis, and the Fall myths, in whatever language,
illustrate humanity's unconscious awareness of human suffering,
which is the failure of humanity which <i>Paradise Lost</i>
symbolises. God is simply a creative power which is part of human
life in the Garden. A voice within man tells him that he can and
should regain the lost brainblood of childhood&#151;should
exercise some degree of control over his own consciousness, in
other words, which is the message of the new developing religions
in the West. The problem facing the established Church is that if
man lived up to his full creative capacities, there would be no
religion.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We decided to go ahead anyway, and started
rehearsals. Hugh Landsdowne, a poet and magician, who had been
imprisoned for growing half an acre of marijuana at his farm in
Essex, linked in the <i>I Ching;</i> and together we made a huge
stroboscopic mandala with an electric motor we pinched from one
of the machines in the tailor's shop. The play was never
performed in either the church or the theatre, due to the
misunderstanding as to what the play was actually about; but it
was seen by most of the inmates at some point in its actual
unfolding; and helped keep our minds off more dangerous matters. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I tend to remember perhaps only the positive things
about my last year in prison. Yet in all honesty I cannot rid
myself of the thought that my life there might have been very,
very different indeed. I think all of us carry around in our
heads some picture of how we imagine prison life to be, though
doubtless altogether impossible to identify in reality. Mine was
a superstitious mixture of Gestapo camps and what I had seen in
American movies. The reality is quite different; there is, for
instance, very little real fear of the intentions of the prison
authorities, who tend to stick to a rule book that does not
include physical brutality or torture or idiosyncratic sadism.
There is also very little physical violence going on between
inmates, though incidents happen from time to time, like anywhere
else. Man is only human after all. And violence is part of his
human nature. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet&#133; the experience of prison <i>is </i>a
painful one. It may be no more than an enduring slight headache,
but it is always there, forever encroaching on your private
world, an impersonal, indifferent environment in which you are
physically contained; and all for the greater public good. Prison
is a feeling, a subjective as well as a purely physical thing. It
hits directly at your sensations, but acting more like a dampener
than an actual brake. It lowers by its sense of decay, its
corridors of refuse, its wasteland approach to fallen humanity.
No wonder one feels saddened to observe how as our twentieth
century develops so too does the machinery of incarceration and
the illegality of our various legal actions, who seek to condemn
even the children who comprise our future brave generation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Prison is some kind of other place in which I would
never wish for anyone to have to live out their simple life or
death. </p>

<h4>CHAPTER EIGHT</h4>

<h3>'WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE'</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<h4>Scandinavia 1967</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>'And when he came to the place where the wild things are
    they roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible
    teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their
    terrible claws till Max said &quot;BE STILL!&quot;<br>
    and tamed them with the magic trick <br>
    of staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once
    and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing
    of all<br>
    and made him king of all wild things&#133; '<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (From a children's
    story by Maurice Sendak) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My life has something of Peer Gynt's about it, more
intimate to me even than I am intimate to myself; just now I
happened to hear Solveig's song on the radio; it quite got hold
of me; to wait loyally a whole lifetime for someone&#133; the
kind of love that triumphs over the hostility of space and time
and separation: this is love. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So it is not entirely without reason that it is to
Norway my spirit will sometimes return, back, I suppose, to its
mythological roots and the magic landscape from which it sprang.
For I am at heart a Northerner, most at home in my Scandinavian
Kingdoms of the snows; essentially a Tundra type. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It had been a long, steamy pig of a summer in
prison and I wanted to empty its bog breath out of my bones:
Norway sounded like the one good place to be. It was thus with a
delicious sense of escaping from the freedom of the cage that I
sat down at the First Engineer's table on the <i>M.S. Blenheim</i>
as she slowly broke anchor in the Tyne at the start of a two-day
voyage to Oslo. This I had arranged.... Once more Proteus expands
across the space of the North Sea, returning to a place where
there is someone 'who loves him best of all', to the land where
the trolls and the Solveigs live&#151;to the Gudbrandsdal Valley,
to be exact. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A few days later I was sitting by myself in an
outfarm high on the upper reaches and timber line of <i>Rayneberg</i>
overlooking Lake Mjoesa and the town of Lillehammer, where the
air is as thin and as pure as Vichy water; and all sounds are
permanently sharp in the mountain stillness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rock was now a feature of my landscape&#151;and the
tiny farm I rented sat plum in a nest of great rocks, and it was
easy to see why the old dalesman family left it for a
State-provided modern apartment in the town. My window looked out
over an untouched moor and the eye was drawn downwards down
tousled slopes of ubiquitous bracken to the lake some 2500 feet
below. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a prehistoric feel about the place and I
now understood why it was this valley which Ibsen chose to set
the home of Peer Gynt, the universal wanderer, the exile in the
heart of each one of us. Yet would a Himalayan <i>Rishi</i>
understand Nordic gods (which the vision of these mountains quite
naturally created in my soul) were he to observe the landscape of
this valley?&#151;I think not; he would probably die of excessive
cold. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I loved the place, especially at night, sitting
by the open <i>peis</i> or fireplace, listening to the softly
stirring firs outside, so silent in my solitary retreat. For my
life here had something of Advent about it&#151;waiting and
hoping and getting on with ordinary things. In certain moods I'd
occupy my time translating Old Norse Sagas. I found this to be an
excellent aid to concentration. There is one text I particularly
remember, from <i>Morkinskinna,</i> a history of twelfth-century
Norwegian kings, which was compiled by an Icelander in 1220; the
text is called 'Audun buys himself a white bear', which actually
turned out to be something of a white elephant; the story is
about one Audun who, desiring to see the world, made the
dangerous voyage from Iceland to Greenland; there he exchanged
his entire cargo for a single white bear. That is all. Nothing
more; it is an exquisite story, exquisitely told: and in the mind
of the thirteenth-century narrator, Audun's behaviour in spending
his cash like this was perfectly reasonable, for Greenland was an
important place at that time, and a white bear a great
treasure&#151;like a white Cadillac might be today, something
whose price is simply our All and not a penny less. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I also got to know a few people in the district and
also in Lillehammer itself, where I would go for my weekly
shopping. On one of these trips I met a Norwegian poet&#151;whose
name escapes me who invited me to attend a reading of 'Nordic
poets' which he had arranged at the local Folk High School, when
I could also read something myself if I so wished. A lot of
people from Oslo were going to be there. And Vesaas, the
celebrated author of <i>The Ice Palace</i>&#151;by which English
reviewers are not much impressed&#151;had promised to attend. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus it was, on the appointed day, at the appointed
time, and with due solemnity appropriate to the almost
reverential sense of 'presence', if that is the right word for a
rather stiff atmosphere. It reminded me more of a meeting of Kirk
Elders than any poetry-reading I had been to before. Absolute
seriousness is not without a dose of humour except in Norway,
where it is absolutely serious that is, until the 'snaps' begins
to flow, when everyone seems to get very wild and something in
the structure of their thought completely snaps, as it were; it
is a completely different psychophysical effect from that of
getting stoned on hashish or marijuana. (A recent report by WHO,
Geneva&#151;'The Use of Cannabis' notes that 'Individuals who
have no taste for the cannabis experience <i>per se</i>&#151;regardless
of moral or other considerations&#151;are more apt to exhibit a
preference of a controlled, structured, rational and secure
approach to life,' as it also suggested that alcohol is much more
closely associated with crime, aggression, and violence than is
cannabis.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At any rate, I had taken the precaution of smoking
several joints on my way down the mountain, and arrived very
stoned that is, 'quiet' and 'sensing'.... 'Those who enjoy
cannabis tend to prefer an unstructured and spontaneous style of
life, are relatively prone to take risks, value states of altered
consciousness, and tend to seek such effects both through drugs
and through other methods.' (Same WHO report). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon the booze began to have its effect, and the
first poet&#151;from Sweden&#151;was helped on to the stage,
where he raged through his mother tongue like a prairie fire, his
bull voice crashing through our heads like falling
masonry&#151;and with about as many mixed metaphors in each line
as in my description of his reading. He finally collapsed in a
wave of laughter or tears, and disappeared backstage and was seen
again no more. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then followed a lady poet from Denmark, who read a
series of poems on the theme of Vietnam, and in the form of
imaginary letters from a Vietcong private to his mother in
Haiphong, telling her about the effects on his mind of being
bombed from planes 'too high in the sky even to see'. And this
had a temporary sobering effect on the listeners, who had perhaps
become aware, even if ever so faintly, that they were somehow, in
some way, also a bit culpable. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Three or four poets in quick succession. And then
it was my turn.... 'Cannabis users are most frequently young,
male, unmarried, and exhibit some instability with respect to
residence, work, school and goals.' <i>(Ibid)</i>&#133; I seated
myself on the stage in the half-lotus position, lit two candles,
which I put on either side of me, and asked that the hall lights
be put out, which was done, though not without a bit of protest
from members of a party from Oslo, who had, I gathered, been
wanting to dance on one of the large tables. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a hush, finally. And into this silent
space I inserted, <i>in the Danish,</i> Timothy Leary's
translation of Tao Sutra number fourteen from the Chinese
classic, the <i>Tao Te Ching,</i> which I reproduce here in its
more familiar English form: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Gazing &#133; they do not see it <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; they call it empty space.<br>
    Listening &#133; they do not hear it <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; they call it silence or noise<br>
    Groping &#133; they do not grasp it <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; they call it intangible<br>
    But here &#133;<br>
    We &#133; spin through it<br>
    Electric &#133; Silent &#133; Subtle' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And since it was the last poem of the evening, and
since Tarjaas Vesaas insisted only upon us speaking what for me
was the obscure dialect form of 'Nynorsk', I made my farewells
and silently&#133;softly&#133; I spun off into a crisp, clear
night of stars, gliding like a fish upstream, reaching <i>Ravneberg</i>
just as a new dawn was breaking. To the sounds of the clapper of
the cattle bells swinging back and forth, moving in flow,
regular, without stop or start so harmoniously held&#133; </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; After a few hours' quiet reflection, I realised
that what had really upset me about the poetry-reading the
evening before was an overheard remark following Ulla Ryum's
'Vietnam poems'&#133; 'Det tross alt er farlig aa leve i Norge
ogsaa&#151;hva med superhighwayene og alt, ikke?' ('Despite that,
it is pretty dangerous living in Norway too&#151;what with these
&quot;superhighways&quot; coming along and everything.') From one
point of view, the person was right but I could imagine there
were many in Vietnam who would gladly exchange the dangers of
Norwegian highways for the sort of life they had to contend with
there. But if I felt this strongly, why should I remain 'aloof
with Hermit Eye' ? Wasn't my situation just as much a 'cop-out'
as for the indifferent majority&#151;just living out our simple
life or death? Or in some Nietzschean sense, was not my life now
also a kind of 'germinative regression', an attempt to return to
my roots ? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had taken to acid and later to myths and ancient
stories to seek a formula that would turn the surrounding world
to dust and reveal the sought for paradise. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'For now I am homesick <br>
    after my own kind: and these people <br>
    touch me not.... ' <br>
    I remember myself as an ancient hero, a wild man <br>
    of the mountains, a guardian of the door, a paradox&#151;<br>
    To sing&#133; of heroes&#133; Now ? <br>
    In this forgotten age ? of giant men ? <br>
    No!<br>
    &#151;Yet I shall speak<br>
    that our giant flies might listen and would know<br>
    the glory that man is&#133;<br>
    IN THE BEGINNING, then <br>
    were men<br>
    men hard and tall, the warriors, who fought <br>
    with man and beast, who knew <br>
    the call of blood and fire, and whose swords <br>
    cut paths to&#133; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but who shall hear
    this&#151;here ? <br>
    The paths, the paths! Immortal paths! Cuhulain rides <br>
    his five fiery chariots across the firmament!<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Arthur and Lancelot in battle! The ground
    shakes!<br>
    IN THE BEGINNING was blood and fire&#133;<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; And now ? <br>
    The matterings of the civilised yet impotent <br>
    conscience of modern society ?<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; No. <br>
    The sound a new-minted coin makes upon a concrete street ?<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br>
    Silence then ? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes&#151;silence. Heroes are dead! <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; We buried them, and did the rites <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; And they've long forgotten us.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (by Kristof
    Konstanty Jastrzebski-Glinka) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus one sits, day in, day out, in urn-like
silence, staring wearily into nothing&#151;you can almost see the
nothing. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet in this nothing it was something to know
that it's not enough to see the light; you have to market the
message. The meaning of silence is only the suspense of our
breath before the storm and the stillness is nothing but the
prelude to catastrophe&#133; like a thunder-cloud in the process
of materialisation, it is the tension of violence held in check.
And do we notice ? Not a bit. We sail on in our aimless craft
lulled in the cradle of all that is&#151;that supremely ordinary
human condition of wakefulness which accepts, without reflection,
the universe as we find it. We are the proverbial
'sleepwalkers'&#133; we experience without any awareness of the
meaning of our experience of life; we are the monolithic mass who
act and speak like men asleep. We are as good as dead. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And is acid to help us wake, or help us dream ? It
can make us conscious of our own mental states as somehow
dependent on the predispositions left by the world we experience
as an impersonal universe; the all too personal soul fashions its
own world in the imagining of dreams&#151;the spirit serves as
light for itself: or worse, we somehow see the visionary delight
of the ego in its own spirituality, its purity, as if it were
itself absolute and infinite.... 'Behold! from the travails of my
soul, before me, above me, between heaven and earth, finite and
yet all penetrating, I see a tremendous figure growing out of the
nothingness of my being, the figure of One whose materialisation
is the Spirit Mercurius !'&#151;Or is it 'Aquarius' ?&#151;there
is such a pantheon of gods in the alchemic line. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But about the state of <i>conscious wakefulness,</i>
or <i>prajna</i> (wisdom), the Vedas tell us that it is a divine
attribute in one who has become aware of the One and is full of
Bliss, Bliss, Bliss.... 'In conscious wakefulness there is no
need or greet, no desire, no thought, and all confusions are
fused into a blessed peace; only knowledge and Bliss remain.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as for the state of 'transcendental
wakefulness', the truly wise know it is incapable of being spoken
of, grasped held, imagined or manipulated; it is without
distinctive marks of any kind&#151;unthinkable, unnameable, for
it is that into which the essence of the knowledge of the One is
resolved, it is the Peaceful, the Benign, the Non-dual.
And&#151;the metaphysical paradox!&#151;One is the self; 'He' is
to be known. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whenever imaginative man penetrates into the
mystical universe which surrounds him, it brings forth spirits
and gods. And the creatures thus born into the world appear
different according to the peculiarity of their parents&#151;just
look at all the historical pantheons, the first recorded
divinities of the Vedic poets, the gods of the Old Testament, the
Egyptian and Greek gods&#151;sometimes maternal, sometimes
paternal&#133; But the unknowable, unnameable, ungraspable 'He'
is at the root of them all, and thus the source of all that was,
and is, and will be, living as an ancestor continues to live in
His distant descendants. And occasionally 'He' appears again in
His own intrinsic form. 'He' is not Jahveh neither is he Allah
nor the Vishnu of the Hindus; 'He' is none of the historical
Gods, for 'He' is nameless. But when 'He' appears we know
it&#151;it was 'He' whom the tribes of Israel saw in the
wilderness, as it was also 'He' before whom the Aryans of the
Himalayas once trembled. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus Leary himself writes in each generation a few
men stumble upon the riddle of consciousness and its solution;
they discover, once again, that beyond the ordinary world of
macroscopic tangible, material things, there are endless levels
of energy transformations accessible to consciousness. They learn
again the age-old lesson taught by mystics and wise men of East
and West: that most of mankind is sleepwalking, moving
somnabulistically through a world of rote perceptions and
conflicting emotions. As have many internal explorers of the
past, they become dedicated to the process of consciousness
expansion, to the ideal of maximum wakefulness and internal
freedom. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is perhaps significant that the psychedelic
experience, which has been popularised by Leary through his
lectures and books in America, has not helped a single American
to a higher education and here I do not exclude myself&#151;but,
on the other hand it has brought all the more into hospitals and
jails. LSD is considered, even in India, as dangerous. Or is it
that it takes a very great deal of acid to produce even a little
elevation of consciousness. The fact is, no one has yet proved
that an increase of individual human awareness&#151;drug-induced
or not&#151;is appropriate to the organisation of
twentieth-century society in the West; it may be that it does
more harm than good in the case of most people. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No, I think the psychedelic experience does
something quite different&#151;it is not a question of the
validity of facts or even of personal manifestation of the
spirit, but <i>of becoming aware in oneself of how to fashion a
new and better reality.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I wanted to go on living in Norway, but however
well one tries to understand oneself and sort out one's
priorities for happiness, reality is forever getting in the way.
You never know what you will be doing until you find yourself
doing it, mysteriously at work again. I had been toying with the
idea of writing a book about my experiences in America, something
positive and forward-looking, reflecting somehow the optimism I
had for the future, the 'practical Utopia' of the Underground s
manifesto of liberation. My need to communicate was very great
indeed, but it had nothing to do with the ego or things like
that; it was, I think, something similar to the urge that
compelled Marco Polo to write about his travels. But there are
two things more important than writing&#151;<i>action</i> and <i>meditation</i>&#151;and
I was impelled by the former. There is perhaps a
transcendentalist anticipation of what I mean in Emerson's
address on the American Scholar: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The sacredness which attaches to the act of creation, the
    act of thought, is transferred to the record. Instantly the
    book becomes noxious. the guide is a tyrant. The sluggish and
    perverted mind of the multitude having once received this
    book, stands upon it, and makes an outcry if it is destroyed.
    Colleges are built on it. Meek young men grow up in
    libraries. Hence, instead of Man Thinking, we have the
    bookworm. I had better never see a book than to be warped by
    its attraction clean out of my orbit, and make a satellite
    instead of a system. The one thing in the world, of value, is
    <i>the active soul.'</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Books make bondage. But the bondage is to an
authority outside ourselves. Freedom lies in getting control of
our own lives back into our own hands&#151;'to stand on one's own
two feet'&#151;and everyone united by mutual affection with
personal relations as the touchstone, creating an environment of
creativity and harmony. But it will take a miracle to free the
human mind: because the invisible reins and chains are magical in
the first place; and each individual will only free himself in
the measure that he knows how to locate and discover his own
proper powers. Whitman, likewise in a transcendentalist sermon
says, 'You shall no longer take things at second or third hand,
nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres
in books.' And the man who is not possessed of an active soul, or
of a self-conscious able to recognise that it is everywhere in
chains to authority outside itself, will not know how to set
about the task of magical self-liberation. But to concentrate
oneself in this direction is a thing which very few individuals
of the West have ever known how to do, for to the rational mind
the ideal of a 'practical Utopia' accomplished on earth is an
apparently impossible task. It would seem to depend upon direct
incarnation of the soul/spirit/Christ in each individual if he or
she were to give direct expression of spiritual values in daily
life. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our Western philosophers have always been
rationalists, for their insights do not depend upon the awakening
of their own souls (most philosophers lead private lives that are
really quite hellish sometimes) but upon a special facility in
their treatment of symbols which awaken
spiritual/religious/philosophical associations in the mind of the
reader. Any true change would have to be based on a different
concentration from that of reason. We must create ourselves out
of whatever it is that is within ourselves, unconcerned with
standardized answers, the so-called scientific methods: it has an
inner rhythm, like that of music. Or, as my Guru puts it, 'We
must first recognise Atman within ourselves, and then realise him
in the world; we should assist Brahman, whose partial expression
we are, to perfect himself in appearance.' And this is something
beyond all power of words&#151;Life is not an art so much as an
experience. 'With the Pillar of Fire goes the Pillar of Cloud.'
At dawn, a pair of trousers; at noon, a cloud. But such mysteries
are unpublishable except as poetry, the veiled truth. This is
also the new doctrine of Ezra Pound, who says: 'Prose is not
education but the outer courts of the same. Beyond its doors are
the mysteries. Eleusis. Things not to be spoken of save in secret
The mysteries <i>self-defended,</i> the mysteries that cannot be
revealed Fools can only profane them. The dull can neither
penetrate the secretum nor divulge it to others.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What is the poet doing in trying to express
mystical reality objectively ? He is looking for a scheme which
would circumscribe it from all sides. And if he describes its
contours clearly and correctly, then every other intelligent
human being could place the content there for himself, so that he
might believe that the poet had shown the 'thing'. But that is
impossible. All the poet has done is to present a frame for that
which we must be conscious of anyhow in order to recognise it.
And recognition is liberation <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That is perhaps why people who have had a
psychedelic experience can 'tune-in' to the secret and occult, in
which God is better honoured and loved by silence than by words,
and better seen by closing the eyes to images than by opening
them. So let's not try to understand everything. LSD may provide
you with a clue as to what is happening. It opens the Doors of
Perception and beyond those doors who can really say ? </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no future, with modern man and man of
the future, which does not resemble what 'free' people are doing
in the world. All are trying to get control over the making of
their own lives; growing their own food in country meadows or
backyards, building their own homes out in the forests, learning
how to farm 'liberated' land and live off the produce of the sea;
learning how to bake their own bread&#133; and learning to love
one another as one enormous family, and with a conscious relation
to, or respect for, the environment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And this implies, in one word, Revolution, not the
revolution against the 'given' which has since the time of Hegel
provided the avant-garde with an excuse for anarchist expression
or behaviours&#151;the answer from the outside&#151;but the
revolution within the self. Total Revolution is
inner-change-in-the-world; the tools are a cultural framework
which bypasses (transcends) the existing projection structure;
and 'religion' is an artistic tool for getting there, through
image, vision and symbol's symbol. ONE METAPHOR CAN CHANGE THE
WORLD: 'Peace of Mind brings Peace on Earth ?'&#151;Yes, but only
if we recognise how the ego is the cause of all the wars inside
the human mind and, by implication, also of all the wars in the
world-at-large. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; How strange that I 'should' do anything again!
But these 'revolutionary' ideas were becoming decisive: action
would decide the rightness or wrongness of our ideas, success
that of volition. It is not enough to take your ease in the world
of ideas and live there naively, as I had earlier thought, for
this would mean that we had merely allowed ourselves to be driven
by the stream of events. We have to know how to guide ourselves
to the goal. I found it increasingly difficult simply to sit and
reflect on all this, for there was still the job of translating
recognition into action. I could not hope to 'change myself'
through 'meditation'&#151;a temperament like mine collapses under
the burden of living in another kind of existence that simply
'is' and needs the challenge of 'should' in order to realise the
goal of 'becoming', which is, I suppose what our Western sort of
life is all about&#151;we believe we 'should' <i>grow, become,
create, perform, perfect again</i>, and this is the impetus for
conscious volition, since our ideas remain nonexistent until they
have been tested in reality, with the self as the first testing
ground. From the point of view of the world, it is mere illusion,
if a holy man regards himself as an incarnation or a Saint he
must <i>become</i> saintly, change himself, if he wishes to be
taken seriously. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In my own case, I felt strongly that I should
return to America, see how my old psychedelic friends were making
out on their 'voyages of self-discovery', meet Tim and Richard
Alpert again, perhaps even settle over there for a time and try
to build a structure in which 1 could exist without losing sight
of my goal. But it was a difficult decision to make, seeing how I
had been out of touch for so long. And apart from considerations
like these, there was the fact that life in America actually
scared me stiff. If paranoia is 'having some idea of what is
really going on', then you could say that I was definitely
paranoid about returning to our brave New World. Just thinking
about New York could send icicles up and down my spine.... my
paranoia took the form of imagining myself walking alone on 11
5th Street from Riverside to Broadway at midnight, or
equally&#151;due to some error in my direction&#151;ending up, an
object of unpleasant attention by members of the 'Roach Guards'
or the 'Five Points Gang', in Broome Street down on the
Bowery&#133; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At any rate, my fears and doubts were overcome
somewhat by Christmas, and early in January I found myself once
again airborne over the Atlantic on a flight that was to land me
a few hours later at Boston's Logan Airport, and the start of a
new chapter&#133; </p>

    <p>'Turn on to acid, man,<br>

    No one knows the human mind... </p>

    <p>There are doors as yet unopened <br>
    So much to see, <br>
    Drop some acid, man, <br>
    Go see what you can find. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I never saw life as I know it, man, <br>
    It was all in my mind. <br>
    Things have become much clearer<br>
    Now that I've opened up my mind. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Before all this, life was such a drag; <br>
    Working on Chrysler's pressure line <br>
    Just to pay for a shag. <br>
    Working on the track <br>
    Just to score some bread <br>
    So I and the wife and kids <br>
    Could be fed and comfy <br>
    In our suburban shack. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>But all that's gone now <br>
    Since I've seen life for the first time <br>
    Through the channels of my mind. <br>
    Acid was the key, it turned me on <br>
    And helped me to find <br>
    The right channels in my mind.' </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Returning to America after an absence of nearly
four years was much more than a sentimental journey, much more
than just filling in time; I was a man trying to maintain his
soul alive. Keep the candle flame ablaze.... When all was growing
dark. It was the wriggling to avoid death, essentially a poetic
thing, undertaken without either rationality or reason. I wanted
to probe something solid to live by. And travel was an available
means to see, look, find &#151; <i>'la vraie vie'.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My internal space had changed since Millbrook and
our first brief experiment in 'transpersonative living', when
acid was the lance with which to ride after the Grail. There was
now (1968) little good acid around, and what there was&#151;the
so-called 'street acid'&#151;came mainly from California. There
was something wrong with the synthesis; it was not pure. And you
were never sure what it was exactly that you were taking, so I
only dropped it on those rare occasions when someone gave me
either 'Sandoz acid' or 'crystal acid'. I think the problem for
the underground chemists manufacturing clandestine acid was
shortage of ergot, without which the synthesis of d-LSD-25 is
impossible. Until 1965, supplies of ergot could be bought with
little or no difficulty from three or four European chemical
companies; but pressure from Washington put a stop to this,
doubtlessly hopeful that this would lead to an end of clandestine
LSD. In one sense the Federal authorities were right. The
underground ceased turning out d-LSD-25; instead, they discovered
a wholly synthetic substance, akin to d-LSD-25 in so far as it
produced marked change in consciousness. But the new synthetic
acid lacked, in my opinion, that invisible non-pharmacological
factor&#151;the magical, spiritual component that was really what
acid was all about. Sure, the new stuff 'worked' in the sense
that any mind-altering chemical 'works' to produce subjective
effects within the body, but it didn't seem to produce in those
who used it any particularly noticeable elevation of either head
or heart; at least, that was the conclusion I had reached in
London. But it was&#151;and probably still is&#151;an unpopular
view amongst the 'cognoscenti', who claim that some of the street
acid is capable of producing positive subjective effects of a
'long-lasting nature', though they readily admit that a lot of
the stuff sold as 'pure acid' is actually methylamphetamine (a
concentrated form of amphetamine, first developed by the U.S.
Army) or a stripped-down ergotamine compound by modern molecular
chemistry. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My evaluation had nothing to do with the notion
that a wholly synthetic drug produced a wholly synthetic
experience&#151;the intellectual response&#151;but was based on
direct, first hand experience (about thirty trips with street
acid in all). And in each session I felt there was something it
lacked&#151;it was too 'electric', too 'speedy' and too
'mind-shattering'. The earlier clarity of 'insight' which I had
obtained via the Sandoz acid was replaced by confusion,
brokenness, words and worlds thrown into absolute dismemberment
or even, absolute chaos, though, I must add, often coupled with a
feeling that I can only describe as 'sublime inflation', a
superabundance of emotive energy; but it could not signify; more
a passionate flame and less the life-giving sun, as it were. I
have read that d-LSD-25 is a semi-synthetic substance, of which
ergot is the organic, i.e. 'living' part. And to say that the
'spiritual' component is contained within the ergot molecules
must sound like a superstition to some, but what I intend here is
to suggest that 'pure' acid has 'metapolitical'
implications&#151;there is a hidden truth or statement in each
acid session which is unaccountably missing in most of my
experiences using the clandestine stuff, Owsley and
'white-lightning' notwithstanding. There is, it seems to me, a
qualitative decline in the subjective acid experience which is
something that does not admit of scientific analysis; it is an
intuitive thing I'd say. At any rate, I personally observed a
voluntary moratorium during this period and would take nothing
until I knew the exact chemical synthesis and where it was made
and by whom. Besides, there was little or no shortage of good
marijuana or hashish, our so-called 'mild psychedelics'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A psychedelic is the solvent which dissolves the
vigorous stereotypes of egocentric behaviour&#151;it transforms
the familiar self without changing a thing; it expands the
moment: yet there isn't anything we can count on or accumulate;
its value is poetic&#151;it helps ferry us across the abyss and
we may thus gain a new amplitude; it is not a 'psychological'
experience but a poetic one. It is best of course to undergo such
metamorphosis by means of tuning in to nature, though it is only
the very rarest of Westerners who can do this; we seem unable to
develop our own power of concentration sufficiently to live
consciously and continuously in our deepest self. We cannot
become more than we are. It may be that we cannot even become
what we are&#151;'there is only becoming' e.e. cummings says; for
us, then, Being is becoming; yet it remains possibility only,
never achievement. It is all a matter of recognition; we must
become capable of visualising ideas in order to live at the very
heart of our being. It is all so simple that any child could do
it (if only we don't try to explain). Or: only a child can do it.
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Cambridge, Mass., is the home of both Harvard
College and M.I.T. and stands across from the city of Boston,
separated by the River Charles, about thirty minutes by taxi from
Logan airport. It was snowing when I reached Gunther's house in
Mount Auburn Street; the town was as if deserted by man. The
gigantic apartment block on the opposite side of the street
towered up from a snowy wasteland, surrounded by a few straggling
trees. Every now and again one saw the lights of a car slowly
moving along the driveway flanking the river; visibility was soon
almost reduced to nil. The lady taxi-driver swore as I paid the
fare, wishing she'd stayed in Boston. Then she propositioned me.
'We could get to know each other in the parking lot,' she added,
waving to the back seat. 'There's not much else to do on a night
like this.' I said I was bushed after the long flight from London
but this only seemed to add spice to her game. 'I've only made it
with one English guy before, and he was the best ball I've ever
had, though a fucking bastard otherwise,' she added. Why not? She
was pretty, in her late twenties. 'Okay. Let's get to the parking
lot,' I said. 'Crazy! But in case you're kinky or something, you
know, want to cut off my tits or anything, Jack-the-Ripper style,
I'll blow your brains out with this.' And reaching inside the
glove compartment she suddenly produced an enormous revolver.
'Protection, you understand. If you want to live in Boston, baby,
you've gotta have a piece. Bam! Get it?' 'Are those things legal
here?' I asked, seemingly dumb. 'Legal, regal; the fuzz ain't
gonna bust ya for a piece, though they get pretty rough if you
kill someone. No, it's protection.' 'But what if everyone carried
a gun, then what...?' 'Then you'd be stupid not to, right?
Anyway, I was only kidding. It ain't got no bullets in the
chamber, maybe just two or three. I use it to scare drunks who
get fresh.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was in the right mood when, a couple of hours and
several drinks later, I rang Gunther's doorbell. I had called
Gunther from the airport but the baby-sitter said he was at the
Gurdjieff centre and wouldn't be back much before
midnight&#151;(a well-observed ritual vouches for the truly human
and therefore natural sequence of human behaviours; if the
meeting which a person needs is missed, then the psyche feels
cheated, and a sense of loss and remorse or worse is bound to
follow. Gunther believed in the ritual attendance of the
Gurdjieff meetings; he didn't necessarily believe in Gurdjieff
rituals, which, so far as one can understand them at all, seem to
depend on the presence of the Master himself, but the weekly
thing was important for the harmonious function of his
creativity.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Gunther was back, and we greeted each other
warmly with hugs and smiles and 'Wow-it's-great-to-see-you'
stuff. Yes, it really did feel good to be back; (almost) as
though I'd never been away. We spent the first few hours rapping,
filling in the blanks, trying to find out what had happened to us
both across the random and haphazard years since Harvard and
Millbrook. For myself change, unceasing change, as though change
was the only constant in my life. And Gunther? He was now
teaching at Boston College. 'A bit ironic, really, a Jew teaching
at a <i>Jesuit</i> establishment', working as a consultant with a
New York media company, 'They sent me to India recently to tape
some Indian music for a record', and running the Boston Gurdjieff
Centre. 'Man, that cat knew more about human psychology than
anyone I've come across before. I really dig his work.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I then discovered that quite a number of the old
Harvard psychedelic class of 1961-62 now worked for the Harvard
Corporation&#151;George Litwin was a professor at the Harvard
Business School, Al Alschuler lectured at the Harvard School of
Education, Dave Kolb was an instructor at M.I.T. and Huston Smith
was still professor of religious philosophy (M.I.T.), Dave Katz
was teaching at Boston's Brandeis University, Walter Clark was a
professor of the psychology of religion at Tufts University and
had helped start the Cambridge Neurobiological and Psychedelic
Study Group (together with Clemens E. Benda M.D., and the late
Max Rinkel M.D.). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Obviously, the medicine of hallucination and the
wonders of indiscipline had lost their appeal&#151;everybody
wanted to forget the 'Harvard Drug Scandal'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'It all seems so ordinary now.' Gunther was almost
apologetic when he spoke about former times. 'People turn on
differently nowadays, you know, <i>sans drugs,</i> <i>sans trips.</i>
Not Young-Man-Left-to Old-Man-Right but evolution of sensibility.
Today people dig astrology, Meher Baba, the Tarot, the I Ching,
Gurdjieff, macrobiotic food, yogas, even plain work.... ' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sure enough, when I did the telephone rounds the
next morning, everyone was into their own 'non-drug' thing. It
was as if Tim Leary and the Harvard Psychedelic Project had never
existed&#151;Al Cohen hadn't taken acid for over four years and
now busied himself as head of the American Meher Baba Group. 'I
dropped acid for three years, and it took me three years to
transcend acid. Now I don't even think about it. Of Acid, the
Avatar had this to say: &quot;It doesn't bring you closer to God,
for I am God and I tell you it takes you further away from
Me&quot;.' Rolf von Eckartsberg, who used to co-edit <i>The
Psychedelic Review</i> was a psychology professor at the
University of Pennsylvania and was running a 'global village'
project in Pittsburg; Paul Lee, also a former co-editor of <i>The
Psychedelic Review</i> was teaching humanities and religion at
the University of California in Santa Cruz; Stanley Krippner was
the director of The Dream Laboratory at the Maimonides Hospital
in Brooklyn; Frank Barron was a professor at Berkeley and the
author of 'Creativity and Psychological Health'; Joe Havens was
also still lecturing and writing papers on the theme 'Religion
Ponders Science'; and Richard Alpert was in India with his Hindu
Guru, Neem Karolli Baba, or simply 'Maharaj-ji' as he is usually
called, who told him, <i> propos</i> LSD, 'In a quiet place
where it is cool and you are feeling much peace, taken alone, it
can bring you into the presence of Christ to do <i>pranams.</i>
But you can only stay a few hours and then must leave. Better by
far to become Christ. For that, Love is the best medicine, better
than LSD. LSD is not the true <i>Samadhi.</i> These medicines
were known about in the Kulu Valley, but now that knowledge is
lost.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It felt almost obscene to mention this three-letter
word under the circumstances and I began to wonder whether I had
got things cocked or somehow not quite right. I was frequently
asked the same question: 'Do you still take acid?' which always
contained a definite, if unspoken clause&#151;after what happened
in Manhattan's Lower East Side and the Haight-Ashbury district of
San Francisco, after reports of people jumping out of windows or
staring at the sun until they were blind, can the psychedelic
experience still claim to a place in the New Age? Did Leary do
for LSD as the liberal-humanist did for stereotaxic surgery
(leucotomy), (which is the selective destruction of brain
tissue&#151;'Law'n Order surgery') and its claim as a therapeutic
adjunct to mental anguish? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not a few thinkers have thought so. During the
years following the Leary-Alpert firings many attacks against
non-prescriptive drug usage have appeared in the mass media. The
corruption of the original mystical insights reported in the
early (1960-63) literature has led to the corruption of popular
opinion, who now view the psychedelic experience as a subject too
complex, too weird to be discussed in a rational way. The mystic
with the gift of the third eye expected to proclaim the reign of
the happily integrated modern soul but instead he had found
himself considered something of an oddball, and a resented one at
that. Now he sits in solitary exile or behind the bars of the
lunatic asylum whilst the village idiot walks Times Square with a
gun in each hand. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Do you still take acid? Does Leary still
proselytise for LSD, trip out for days?' our visitor asks, as one
may also be supposed to know about heroin, cocaine, speed,
glue-sniffing and nitrous oxide. 'Mass-mysticism is poetry, an
open secret&#151;the message is in the seed.' As ancient Zen
might have had it&#151;'Take LSD for ten years, become LSD, and
then forget about it'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The power of Zen&#151;there is nothing to hold on
to; the power of the aphorism. In his Frederick William Atherton
lecture (Harvard University, 1967), Norman O. Brown reminds us
that </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Aphorism is instant dialectic<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; the instantaneous flip instead of the elaborate
    system...<br>
    And so perishable<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; that it cannot be hoarded by any elite <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or stored in any institution.'<br>
    'Aphorism: the word smells of literary self-consciousness the<br>
    reality is &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; brokenness<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; words in absolute dismemberment <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; or even, absolute self-contradiction.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like the historical Oxford Movement the Psychedelic
Movement is a Western response to the pathogenic signs of our
inner disruption, and is recognised as such by the New Radicals
and by a tiny circle of metaphysicians in both the West and the
East, just as the revolutionary anarchist movement was a century
ago. For LSD is anarchistic, it shatters our complacency,
explodes our stereotypes of ideology and dogmas, wakes, shakes,
and makes the inner sleeping man from the somnambulist gravity of
rectitude or righteousness. It is the madness that revels in the
categories of being in which not one member is sober. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madness need not necessarily be a cause for
gloom&#151;our greatest blessing, says Socrates in the <i>Phaedrus</i>,
come to us by way of madness&#151;provided; and the madness comes
from God, he adds, someone like the God Dionysus or the spirit
Mercurius or Siva, a condition which cannot be programmed,
something whose truth lies beyond all power of words. Yet smile
at our sad impasse. We cannot simply let ourselves go. 'I am
fully aware of this,' Ionesco says, 'teach me how to untie the
knots. I know I ought to undo them on my own and that this is a
task everyone must carry out for himself, but at least give me a
little guidance, so that I can see how the bonds I cannot loosen
are tied.' But no help is forthcoming. The only reality is the
truth of our own contradictory nature; truth is simply a more
efficient form of fiction, Maya like everything else. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Can anyone teach Ionesco to untie the knots? 'The
principal instrument of monopoly and control that prevents
expansion of consciousness is the word lines controlling thought,
feeling and apparent sensory impressions of the human host,' says
Burroughs, but he makes a common error for he fails to
distinguish the word from the experience. Another answer:
according to Joey Mellen and Bart Huges, is that it is man's
rigid cranium that prevents him from expanding his consciousness,
not his words... </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'When the skull seals the tide of brainbloodvolume is <br>
    out on the beach the adult dangles from the gallows&#151;<br>
    around his neck a chain of word associations&#151;<br>
    suspended on his own sentence<br>
    the adult passes judgement on his children&#151;<br>
    his children&#151;if they've any sense&#151;pay no attention <br>
    but bounce about<br>
    on a cushion of intra-cranial pressure <br>
    until their skull seals.... ' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ionesco, the new message is: 'If you want to get
ahead get a hole in your head.' Perhaps the advantage is with
Tibet where prayer wheels are another way of arriving at the same
result&#151;an egoless involvement with the abyss inside the
self&#151;any fool can do it: the mechanism is external while the
mind if left vacant; and vacancy is not the worst condition of
the mind; the go, being non-existent, does not have to store,
retrieve, catalogue, analyse or identify. But perhaps the last
word can be left to Norman O. Brown, speaking of the place (and
need) for the 'transforming spirit of play' and of that great
revolutionary intellectual of the twentieth century, James Joyce:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'who reduced all that solemn nonsense to nonsense leading
    us in the path to which Wittgenstein directed us from
    disguised nonsense to patent nonsense a transition that is
    accomplished not by linguistic analysis but by poetry.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leafless trees, the cold, clear air of winter;
wide, snow-covered streets on which students wander about, whose
physical appearance is different from when I was last here. Odd,
really, how quickly the young respond to change. Whilst only
seven or eight years ago the style was teeth-and-tweeds,
button-down shirts and college ties, the mode of dress now veered
on the far side of informality&#151;jeans, denim shirts, cowboy
boots and Afghan coats; and beards and long hair were everywhere
prevalent. It was as if one psychic atmosphere had spread from
California to Italy. Millions of similar people everywhere in the
West. And their lifestyle was loose, unstructured; they seemed to
roll on like the waves, whose movement is regulated by invisible
forces emanating from the moon. They were beings who were in
possession of a secret which provided the impetus to their lives;
their aims were more inward; they had a feeling for values; they
had achieved a certain level of consciousness. Were they not
somehow more open than in any age previously, which gave them
this new amplitude and a sense of purpose? And if you were to ask
them, 'What for the future?' it is to themselves they would
point. What folly to believe in a Providence which guides life
from the outside! This is the change in itself. Where growth is
guided by conscious volition, development of the personality
takes place; everyone progresses, marches onward, further and
further, and no end is in sight. Here was a new generation for
whom time is real before eternity. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How good for the mental health of modern youth to
imbibe a little Eastern wisdom. Everybody who believes in
himself, no matter who he is, stands on a higher level than the
timorous&#151;yes, the formative power of the Brahmanic and
Buddhistic, but also the Islamic East, can help us achieve the
ideal of universal brotherhood, whereas the received teachings of
the West fail in spite of their ideals. For whatever power the
spiritual message has exerted over the minds of men has surely
come from the unique degree of involvement which it posits
between the divine and the here and now. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As I wandered the Cambridge streets, I thought of
my earlier days of largely harum-scarum activity and what had
happened to us all across these random and haphazard years of
pilgrimage. And sometimes, when I am in a reflective mood, I
wonder if there is a secret connection between spiritual
necessity and empirical accident? How is it that this strange
drug LSD had such immense consequences, and was discovered
seemingly by accident alone? For the revolution in sensibility
produced results which the LSD-users did not&#151;and perhaps
could not&#151;foresee. But this is true for all
revolutionaries&#151;revolutions have to be considered as very
complex series of actions initiated in highly particular
circumstances and at particular points in time. 'Each age gets
the revolution it deserves', is perhaps a truism, yet it is in
fact that a small change of empirical circumstances, and the
psychedelic revolution would not be the widespread manifestation
which it is. It was now possible to see that an acceleration in
our brief new renaissance had turned the Leary-Alpert streams
into a river and that the whole movement, first of Harvard
1960-61, then of the International Federation for Internal
Freedom in 1963-64 and the Castalia Foundation of 1964-67 and the
League for Spiritual Discovery of 1966-68, etc., etc., was the
result of a series of accidental circumstances in which groups of
LSD-users discovered a peculiar disposition in their thought
which allowed them to transform a triviality into a profound
spiritual belief and allowed them to appreciate individual human
existence as the living expression of metaphysical reality,
because the psychedelic experience signified the reality and the
beauty of the flower of the spirit. And thus the Age of the
Flower Children was born out of the individual experience of
transcendence, just as, in an earlier age, the Vedic <i>Soma</i>
brought the light of consciousness into the world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What is the significance of the psychedelic
movement? I do not know myself. I have struggled with the problem
for years. But the facts are beyond question: the psychedelic
renaissance, like all great periods of culture, cannot be
explained altogether out of a demonstrable series of causes. If
anything, they seem to owe their existence ultimately to a
spiritual influx which bears the unmistakeable stamp of divine
grace, something given rather than made. And once the source of
inspiration has dried up, no effort and no talent is of any
avail. Further, since the height of the psychedelic impetus, the
insights have declined, in spite of all the psychedelic sessions
which have occurred through these years, and today the LSD-user
probably possesses less creative taste than any educated
non-user, although they are still spiritually the most developed.
What does this signify?&#151;I know only that LSD has decorated
the world of ideas. In what then lies LSD's unique quality, its
appeal for the person who takes it? Perhaps it is the discovery
of the existence of shades of inner meaning one would not
normally credit with the capacity for signifying so much. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us transpose ever so slightly the elements of
visionary knowledge, or change the varieties of the spiritual, or
use a different method for gaining deeper insights; or place the
individual, as he is, into another setting which is subject to
different environmental conditions, such as, for instance, a
damp, ill-lit and unheated cave somewhere high in the Himalayas:
it would be the revelatory 'mystical' experience no longer. I
have seen such non-drug revelatory methods for getting westerners
'high' not fifty miles from Kathmandu: they lack the crystal-like
clarity or immediacy of the psychedelic experience. The
psychedelic experience makes particularly clear what the nature
of individuality really is. It must seem a pity to some that
anything could be metaphysically real which is manifestly so
dependent upon empirical circumstances, in this instance, upon a
psychedelic drug. It illustrates, on the other hand, that the
spiritual component in man can only become visible subject to
special empiric conditions. It doesn't solve the riddle of man's
spiritual nature, nor is it a key to a metaphysics of ecstasy (as
some thinkers have claimed); no matter how many causes and
relations we establish: the essential escapes us. This says
little in favour of those who incline to the belief that the
LSD-user may thus far participate of metaphysical reality. But
the visionary experience is essentially brief; once achieved and
expressed, it becomes subject, like everything else, to the
merciless downward pull of gravity and the world of three
dimensions, that non-miraculous world of appearances we call
either prison or home, which is manifest everywhere around me
even now as I type these lines. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But reality must still count for something, and
this is perhaps more true in America (than in any other country
I've ever lived in), where prosperity is regarded as normal; he
who simply contents himself, i.e. turns himself on, is regarded
as feeble. The idea that divine blessedness and prosperity are
connected is still effective today: the man who discovers Christ
within him will become rich, healthy, an accomplished individual
in this lifetime; it is a religious belief that teaches the
possibility of uniting one's struggle for the goods of this world
with ideal aspirations. The man who is pleasing to God must
become rich; the fruits, which hitherto have fallen only to the
lot of him who renounces the world, can now be shared by him who
affirms it. This is the teaching of 'a religion of democracy';
the materialism of our era is Hallowed in Thy name... </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am constantly relapsing into didactics, though
no teacher I; on the contrary, I discourage any kind of
followership, since my capacity for head-work is limited. I am
also without the necessary information. So I drift; I am that
aimless drifting man who, setting out in the first light of dawn
like a ship to sea, never knows when or with what cargo he will
return to port; and to invite anyone to follow me on such a
reckless enterprise would be akin to negligence, if not actually
actionable. One has a few friends, and of course they help
sustain one through periods of change or difficulty, but in the
final analysis, one must chart one's own drift course through the
peculiarities of our modern kind of existence. It is a situation
I once discussed with Tim Leary&#151;who confided in me his own
strategies as a mentor of modern youth, which again confirmed my
belief that he is one of the wisest, most illuminatory beings
that the world has ever known.... The main theme of his
philosophy, which he has dealt with in his book, <i>The Politics
of Ecstasy</i> is the 'seven levels of consciousness&#151;<i>solar,
cellular, somatic, sensual, symbolic, stupor</i> (emotions) and <i>sleep',</i>
what he calls 'the seven tongues of God'; 'seven dialects of
energy, each triggered by the appropriate chemical&#151;<i>LSD,
mescaline, hashish, grass, stimulants, booze, narcotics'.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary's message is that we die, creatively
speaking, when we cling too fast to the definite, and that beyond
the falsifications of egocentric consciousness lies the world of
awareness which we must locate, pry out and finally weld to our
being and in this way achieve affirmation of God, the world and
the other people in it. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The yoga of drugs is of course a key method. The sexual
    yoga is also key&#151;access to and control of sexual energy.
    Nothing can be renounced. All is God. Every energy is divine.
    All must be understood and controlled for <i>spiritual
    purposes,</i> including the yoga of power. All energy is
    available to him who accepts the basic energy formula; all
    energy is available to him who knows that it must not be
    grabbed, held, possessed or used for any other purpose except
    spiritual.' (Private correspondence.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a beautiful message and one that could become
a proper matter of concern for a generation raised on Marx,
Dulles, Thieuing gum and Coca-Cola. It is thus not without
precedent that Leary, like Socrates before him, should be
convicted by his peers of corrupting a nation's youth, for
history, like the big wheel in a cosmic funfair, spins slowly
towards the final revolution... and mankind has not progressed
even one iota. And, most tragic of all, the protoplasm seems
happy. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing how many of the original Harvard
Psychedelic Project were working for the Corporation, it was not
too difficult to persuade the university to have me back, this
time, however, not as a four-hours-a-week instructor to
third-year graduate students in psychology but as a trainee
librarian at the Harvard University Library. The plan was that I
should work as an assistant curator of Scandinavian Aquisitions,
attend a two-year course in Library Science at Boston's Sammer's
college, and then stay on as a full librarian, with faculty
privileges; and perhaps teach one course after this probationary
period. The authorities were nervous, perhaps understandably, but
in their own way showed a remarkably liberal, open-minded
attitude about having me back. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first few weeks were spent learning how books
were indexed and catalogued and how to find my way around the
'stacks' underneath the main library building, which is an art in
itself, for the Harvard Library (second only to the Library of
Congress in Washington) had been assembled through the years with
stolid incompetence, and I dare say that no one is entirely sure
where all the books are. Certainly in my section, the
Scandinavian language collections were catalogued in such a
manner that it could sometimes take a whole day to locate a
particular book, even for an experienced librarian. The reason
given for this odd state of affairs was that until quite recently
the Curators were usually eccentrics and not infrequently quite
possessive about 'their' books, often devising an elaborate
personal coding system to stop students borrowing them; that is,
unless you asked the Curator himself to locate the particular
book for you. But times and people change. A new breed was taking
over, as it were; soon only <i>professional</i> librarians would
be in charge. No more muddling through. Efficiency was now the
touchstone by which a librarian was to be judged. The library did
not offer a complete life, as enclosed and dedicated as a
monastery, but a career, like any other. Certainly, it <i>helped</i>
if you had a taste for books or reading, but the main thing was
knowing how to catalogue the stuff. It was even envisaged that,
in time, the entire library would be computerised, though plans
for this innovation had met with little response from the higher
'invisible' echelons who contemplated such suggestions in the
cloistered calm of their private rooms. I was told about one
Curator, in charge of Burmese Acquisitions, I think, who had been
dead in his private room for nearly two months, and was only
discovered when a student, due to some error in his walk, had
accidentally opened the door and saw this decomposing figure
huddled in a huge leather armchair. The story goes that the
student, far from being surprised at the condition of the old
man, actually asked him for directions to the Poetry Room. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The work was interesting enough, however, and I
suppose I could have stuck it out through the two-year training
period, but something happened to change my direction. Gunther
and some other friends had obtained space in a huge loft-like
building in Nutting Road near Harvard Square. It was called the
'Cambridge Readeasy'&#151;a sort of free university-cum-workshop
in 'Communication, Creativity and Awareness'. And they invited me
to run a poetry workshop involving poets and students in the
greater Boston area. This was fine as far as I was concerned for
it gave a focus to my life and an excuse to meet and hear some of
the younger poets, who I encouraged to drop around and take part
in the experiment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Readeasy soon became quite popular with the
local Underground, who kept us all well-supplied with grass and
the occasional pipe of opium. But this was not the reason why I
left Cambridge (in fact, it was probably the high quality of the
grass that was keeping me there), but the arrival of Leary for a
lecture series in Boston, when we met and he invited me to join
him in Berkeley. I was a bit hesitant at first, perhaps because I
felt more at home on the East Coast, but my curiosity got the
better of me, and a few weeks later I resigned from the library
and was jetting across America to San Francisco, where Tim picked
me up at the airport; and the start of a new adventure. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; California&#151;land of the Brave or land of the
Freaks? Tim had no doubts in his mind: 'California is at least
one year ahead of the East Coast in Aquarian life-styles,
sophistication, and enterprise. Here is where it is all
happening.' I said the weather was nice. 'Yeah; warm, sunny and
soft, just like a beautiful woman.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon we were in the city and Tim said he'd give me
a tour, starting on Fisherman's Wharf and home of some of the
best seafood restaurants in America. From there we drove along
Chinatown's Pacific Avenue and Grant Avenue, where the sole
business seemed to be food. Chinese variety shops ran like a
strip of tinsel through the heart of the city. From there we
drove up to Nob Hill, home of the rich and the elegant, where
tradition is slow to change and the residents carefully preserve
an air of bygone days while sparing no modern convenience. Then
back to Market Street where we dropped by a couple of bars before
going on to the Haight and a Japanese restaurant for lunch. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then in the afternoon we visited Eldridge Cleaver
of the Black Panthers, a very impressive personality who was in
the middle of his campaign to become the first coloured president
of the United States. Basically, the line he presented was
something like this: 'When you vote for me you are voting for
this finger'. He would then hold up the index finger of his right
hand. 'This finger. Because this finger is the finger that
presses the button. And, man this finger ain't <i>never</i> going
to push any button. Do you trust Nixon's finger anywhere <i>near</i>
that red button? I don't. So when you vote, remember, you're
voting for the finger that won't push the button', etc., etc.
He'd been out campaigning most of the morning and seemed a bit
tired when we met him, but he welcomed Tim warmly, like an old
friend, joking and fooling, and every now and again telling Tim
that the Black Panther Party was really getting it together. A
very remarkable man, I thought. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And on to Menlo Park just south of the city to meet
Ken Kesey, who I remembered from the early Harvard days, when he
was then known as the author of <i>One Flew the Cuckoo's Nest,</i>
a brilliant novel about the goings-on inside a mental hospital.
Now he was into his political bag, and had hopes of uniting the
various hippie factions in the Bay Area into a coordinated party,
something similar to the Panther organisation, but looser,
without too many rules. Tim said that he was considering running
against Reagan as Governor of California: 'I'd strip the cops of
their guns, double their salaries and encourage them to smoke
dope. I'd also introduce a &quot;marijuana tax&quot;&#151;like
the annual automobile tax, only much higher, say, one thousand
bucks a year. And then I'd distribute the revenue amongst the
Californian middle-class. In that way, everyone would be happy.'
There were immediate and voluble objections from Ken and the
others in the apartment, 'Man, one thousand bucks to smoke weed?
You'd never get any of the heads to vote for that. Fifty bucks,
maybe. But one thousand... man, do you know how much weed you
could buy for that? Enough to keep you stoned for months. Better
think again &quot;Uncle Tim&quot; if you want to get my vote.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An hour or so chewing the breeze, and back to San
Francisco again, to a small building across from the Panhandle
Park where 'The Messiah' lived with his commune of followers, and
the headquarters of 'The Messiah's World Dope Crusade'. There was
no reply when we knocked on the door, but it wasn't locked so we
walked in. The house was silent. Tim then opened one of the doors
leading into a huge living-room where a group of perhaps six
beautiful girls were seated in a circle on the floor holding
hands. They all seemed to be crying. No one looked up as we
entered, and Tim immediately put on a serious expression and
quietly joined this tearful circle. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After a few minutes had passed, Tim asked after The
Messiah. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'He was busted this morning. The fuzz came round
and busted him for ten keys (kilograms) of grass. Man, like we
needed to raise bread on that for our new macro bakery.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Where is The Messiah now?' Tim gently asked. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Down at the Precinct, I guess. They said they'd
been watching him for weeks and that this time he'd go down for a
long time.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Why didn't he pay them off?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ' 'Cos we'd spent all our bread on this new
consignment and only had a couple of hundred bucks or so in the
house.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Is there anything I can do?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Just pray. That's what we're doing.' </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On the way to Berkeley mention of the raid was
made on the FM news. It seemed that The Messiah had told the desk
sergeant that unless he was released that afternoon he'd have to
take 'drastic action'. He was reported as saying that he'd use
his telepathic powers to cause a two-hour traffic jam on the Bay
Bridge during the evening traffic rush. He was released on a
nominal bail, a few hours later. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon we were in Berkeley and Tim's house in Queen's
Road, high in the hills overlooking the campus and the Bay. We
made it just before the curfew&#151;the Free Speech Movement was
rioting against the Vietnam war. There had been campus revolts
every day for a week, and the police had introduced a curfew
after nightfall. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim used to refer to his house as 'The Embassy'.
There was a constant stream of visitors of all shapes, shades and
sizes, each one involved at some level with the revolutionary
Underground. And they would make their reports to Tim who'd then
comment or make suggestions or give them some LSD. I was thus
able to get a picture very quickly of what was happening in
California, mainly talk actually, though sometimes you'd meet a
veteran of some campus riot or other. I think the only really
sensible and coherent person in the area was Jerry Garcia of 'The
Grateful Dead'. 'Acid,' he used to say, 'has changed
consciousness entirely. The US has changed in the last few years
and it's because that whole first psychedelic thing meant
&quot;here's this new consciousness, this new freedom, and it's
here in yourself&quot;.' He was later to develop his thesis in a <i>Melody
Maker</i> interview... </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'I think we're beginning to develop new capacities just in
    order to be able to save the world from our trips&#151;you
    know, pollution, etc.&#151;if for nothing else. Just for
    survival. The biological news is that in 100 years from now
    life on earth is finished, so what has to happen is this
    organism has to adapt real quick and develop new capacities
    to stem this flow, to maybe head it off somehow. In this
    scheme of things, politics and all those things belong to the
    past. They're meaningless, going down the drain.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After a couple of months in Berkeley, we moved to
Southern California, to a ranch in Idyllwild near the San
Bernardino Forest and the headquarters of the Brotherhood of
Eternal Love, a former Los Angeles motor-cycle gang who had taken
acid and dropped out of crime and into dope-dealing. And Tim it
was who had become their leader/guru/teacher. The ranch was sited
a couple of miles along a dirt road off the Palms-to-Pines
Highway; the hills at the back overlooked Palm Springs and the
desert. It was a beautiful place, and there were some thirty of
us living there. Tim lived in a small bungalow with his wife,
Rosemary, while I had a room in a smaller building adjacent. The
Brothers either lived in the ranch house or in small
outbuildings. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ranch hadn't been lived in for over a year, so
there was a lot of work to be done. For my part, I built a sauna
hut, utilising a couple of old stoves for the purpose and
insulating the walls with sand. There was room inside for perhaps
half a dozen people, and we'd often retire there in the evenings
with a couple of cherry pipes filled with hashish, and sweat and
smoke until we'd either pass out or freak out in the heat. I also
worked the huge caterpillar bulldozer in an attempt to smooth out
some of the bumps in the earth road leading to the ranch, but it
kept breaking down or, perhaps due to my inexperience with
heavy-duty machinery, it would sometimes swivel off the road and
into the ditch and it could take all of us a whole day to get it
back on the road again. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The summer passed gloriously, and apart from the
occasional police helicopter hovering overhead, we were not
troubled much by contact with the outside world. There was also a
lot of good acid available, and we would celebrate each Full Moon
in the mountains, when the sessions would be run along the lines
of the Indian Peyote ceremonies&#151;that is, we'd all be seated
in a circle around a blazing fire chanting or shaking an Indian
rattle to ward off evil spirits. There would also be drums and
guitars, and sometimes one of the Brothers would dance around the
fire shouting incoherently as though touched with the 'gift of
tongues', though you'd hardly call us Pentecostal. We also tried
to communicate with flying-saucers of which many had been
reported in the skies above the ranch. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; However, by the Fall, I was again restless, this
time for a more solitary refuge, somewhere where I could simply
be, and preferably alone. I had met too many people in
California, heard too many things, maybe even taken too much
acid. Now I wanted out. And it was thus to Tonga in the South
Pacific that I went... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nine hours after leaving San Francisco, I caught my
first glimpse of the tropical islands of the South Pacific as we
flew low over Fiji. The richness of the landscape below was
overwhelming everywhere. Perfect beauty abounded, in which
meaning and expression are one. This peaceful island of lush
jungle which blossoms like flowers was surrounded by dark green
hills and encircled by a rich blue sea, as still and as peaceful
as a lake. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then Tonga! This Other Eden of palm trees
shooting upwards to the sky, rich, luxuriant, yellow beaches and
an exquisitely blue sea lapping against the shores. When I
stepped off the plane I was so thrilled that I immediately set
off on a long walk, and when I returned, feeling weary, I
thought, as I reclined in a comfortable wicker chair on the
shaded balcony of my tiny hotel: thou art in paradise. Here
should I be; and be free from myself.... And as I looked out
across the garden over the tree tops, I saw hordes of monkeys who
pursued, in a silent tight-rope dance, their fodder for the
evening meal. How delightful it is to be in a world which was
finally created on the fifth day! Here nothing has changed, here
everything is simple and true. I was beginning to understand why
most truly great minds prefer 'nature to human society'. The
latter limits, the former liberates. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How harmonious the landscape in the light of the
sunset. The sea reflects the last light of the sky. The
screeching of the gulls high above the water and the shrill
chirping of the cicadas fills my mind as no music ever could. In
the narrow road opposite an old fisherman carries his nets; I can
hear him singing to himself, softly, to the rhythm of the
breaking waves. He is faithful to himself and to the spirit of
nature; I could believe that this solitary wayfarer understands
the doctrine of nirvana in the way in which an enlightened saint
wishes to have it understood. Here there is no striving, for
everything happens of its own accord. One's volition wanes
irresistibly. I feel in this hothouse air it is futile to work,
to wish, to strive; it is not I who think, but nature thinks in
me, it is not I who wish, but something wishes in me. For this
native fisherman, Buddha's doctrine of cognition is a matter of
course, the result not of self-determination but of his own
psychic process developing at one with nature; its truth is
something which the most cultured Westerner only very
exceptionally perceives. Here thought seems somehow superfluous;
here nothingness is the background of semblance; the intellect
turns away, as it were, from its possible content; it becomes
more and more empty, till at last no thought remains. The mind is
as bland and as blank as a bank of snow. Such simplicity of mind
signifies a form of existence which proceeds without effort. And
everything happens naturally, without conscious effort and
without the direction of the will; indeed, in the tropics the
will is so small that the wish fails to become father to the
thought. Life is thus essentially a mindless involvement with
nature, with mediocrity as the purest form of normality. Here it
is possible to achieve everything by doing nothing. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tonga itself is a collection of perhaps 150 small
islands, mostly uninhabited. It is Blessed, for it was dedicated
to Heaven at Pouono by King George Tupoul, and there is a strong
sense of the religious amongst its peoples, their faith is firmly
rooted in the worship of Christ. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I spent the first week in Nukalofa, the capital,
resembling in appearance a sort of shanty town you normally
associate with the ghetto districts of Georgia or
Alabama&#151;lots of corrugated iron and shed-like dwellings,
semi-derelict store fronts and flaked woodwork, but still
charming for all that. But I longed for isolation, for I was
impatient of humankind and wanted to live in the jungle where the
only sounds would be natural ones. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After consulting a map I decided upon Vava'u, a
tiny speck of an island some 150 miles distant from the main
island, and a two-day sail by steamer. I telephoned the Governor
to ask his permission to stay on the island, explaining that I
was a writer and needed the peace and quiet in order to write a
book. He was most gracious and hospitable, and even offered to
send his Land Rover to pick me up at the pier. Perfect. Now I
could unwind; find there my final dwelling place, and forget all
the despairs of consequence which had plagued my life in the
West. Somehow, incredibly, I had escaped from the concrete
jungles of London and New York and San Francisco, and in a
tolerably good state. Now I could begin the slow work of salvage,
become whole again, maybe even find that peace of head or heart I
had sought through all these years of largely accidental
activity. I had found an excuse for living. And I intended to
plan my own death very, very, carefully, which alone can give the
meaning to one's life. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Vava'u was all that I had anticipated; indeed more,
since it manifested itself in the form of the most delicately
sensuous natural beauty, especially in the morning, when the sea
flows in golden waves towards the rising sun; the whole island
seemed to be divinely transfused: one feels inclined, like the
pilgrims on the Ganges, to sink down every morning before the
beauty of the place in fervent gratitude. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You can imagine my surprise, therefore, when, on my
second morning&#151;I had rented a bamboo and thatched hut a
couple of miles from the tiny port on the edge of the bush&#151;I
was awakened by the sound of pop music. Nothing could have been
more incongruous or unexpected, and I feared at first it was an
auditory hallucination. But the noise persisted, and, quickly
dressing, I followed the sound into the bush until I came to a
small hut. I knocked on the door. No answer. So I knocked again.
This time a voice, an American, answered&#151;'Who is it?'
'Friend,' I said. 'Enter, friend.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I pushed open the door and inside were three young
men dressed in jeans and sweat shirts. The air was redolent of
marijuana, and everyone appeared to be pretty stoned. I said I'd
heard the music and, curious, had followed the sound. Did they
mind if I sat down and joined them? 'Nope.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It turned out that they were members of the Peace
Corps, of which there were about 120 scattered about the islands,
seven of whom were on Vava'u. The Tongalese called them
'voluntary workers'. Some taught English in the schools, some
worked as medical assistants for the Medical Department, and some
were working as farmers. These three seemed a nice bunch of guys.
And the ice was quickly broken when I told them I was writing a
book about psychedelics. 'Did you bring any acid with you?' one
of them asked. 'I did as a matter of fact&#151;about 100 trips of
&quot;sunshine&quot;, which is about as pure as you can get. Have
any of you taken acid?' None of them had, but each said he'd like
to try some. 'How about some grass? Do you have any?' I asked.
'Sure,' one of them said passing me the plastic bag filled with
marijuana. 'Roll yourself a joint. It's great weed. We grow it
locally. It's dynamite. ' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The effect was excellent, and soon I was as stoned
as they were. Jefferson Airplane were playing on the Sony
cassette, loud and energetic, playing tight and clean, blowing
our minds. You didn't have to listen to it with great
concentration. You can just sorta drift with it. Then followed
some Grateful Dead&#151;<i>Anthem Of the Sun</i> and <i>Aoxomoxoa;</i>
very soulful and communicative, a liturgy of the hip. The music
was creating good vibes all around, with everything becoming one
music; or rather, everything inside becoming <i>all</i> music,
which is what true pop music is all about, the obliteration of
thought for sensation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the Peace Corps guys was really uptight
about a recent debate in the Parliament. Apparently, a member of
the Tongan Parliament had complained that they were starting
their own private businesses by growing small gardens, selling
the produce, and feeding chickens so as to sell the eggs. He said
they were trying to change Tongan customs. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Here, let me read you some of what this cat
    said&#151;&quot;Our women who used to wear a dress, the
    traditional <i>tupenu</i> and <i>ta'ovala</i> are now
    clothing themselves in one yard of cloth. Even the huge women
    use up only one yard, making it so tight that their
    sharp-shinned legs show and it makes them look thick on the
    right side and thin on the left.&quot; Crazy! Now dig this,
    &quot;When they are walking in the streets, you can't tell if
    they are coming or going! This has come from the examples set
    by the voluntary workers. All the spiritual feelings I
    experience when I am in the church vanish when these
    voluntary workers enter the church building with the clothes
    they wear. Very often I feel like getting up and throwing
    them out. Therefore I ask the Premier that if a copra boat
    should come, let us pack them all in it and send them back to
    America. Soon they will be wearing only underwear to
    church.&quot; But he got no steam from the Premier, who also
    happens to be the king's brother, Prince Tu'ipelehake. He
    really took the wind out of the sails, telling this uptight
    cat, Tu'akoi' that instead of being critical he should be
    grateful.... &quot;God made their visit possible. It is often
    a mystery that, without knowing or being acquainted with
    anyone, they are willing to sacrifice t o give such help. The
    sacrifice and usefulness have been proved today not only to
    the Government, but also to the people, the country and the
    church. Love is repaid with love, and the understanding and
    the willingness to help is the most important of all. We
    should consider such gratitude and sacrifice. I believe that
    if they have sacrificed for Tonga, not one of us here in this
    house could do more for Tonga. We should be grateful and we
    have given an oath to be rightful and loving in our work for
    His Majesty King Tupou IV and the country&quot;.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After a few days I had got to know the seven local
Peace Corps quite well. We'd spend a lot of time rapping. And
there was plenty of grass from their gardens. We also discussed
having a 'sunshine' session together, on one of the small
uninhabited islands close by. We settled on one weekend, and
taking supplies of food and water for two days, we took the
motor-boat to a small island of palm trees and golden beaches
about three miles from port. I had previously explained at some
length what sort of reaction to expect and how to overcome any
paranoia by fixing the mind on a natural object like a stone or a
coconut, or by chanting the 'Vajra Guru Mantra'&#151;OM AH HUM
VAJRA GURU PADMA SIDDHI HUM&#151;which represents the vital
essence of the 84,000 sections of the Dharma, 'and in this way
attain the <i>siddhis</i> of the wrathful deities'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The session began shortly after we landed. It was a
morning of bright golden sunlight and a clear blue sky and sea,
no sound from anywhere; a perfect setting. Soon the 'sunshine'
began to take effect, and again I was transported into the heart
of my intra-atomic self, that place of reconciliation and bliss
in which all life lives in the unity of the One. But I was unable
to stay there for long; one of the group had begun to declare
himself as Jesus Christ and insisted that we were his disciples.
And the force of his conviction, coupled with an increased
rapidity and volume of his speech, began to take over our heads
so that soon we were lost in a maze of contradictory thoughts and
feelings, expressed variously in anger, laughter, dismay and
fear. In vain I tried to get him to keep quiet, but he continued
to expatiate on the evil he saw in life and insisted that we
follow him on a crusade to save the world. Very soon the harmony
of the session was lost, and people either wandered off by
themselves or sat as if transfixed by this Christ figure,
submerged under the non-stop repetitious flow of words. As there
was nothing now I could do to silence him, I too ambled off along
the beach, just hopeful that our new Christ would talk himself
into silence by the time I got back. OM AH HUM VAJRA GURU PADMA
SIDDHI HUM I intoned as I slowly walked along the shoreline
stopping every now and again to pick up a shell or observe the
miracle of the sand turtle or the vigorous motion of tiny
crabs.... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When I got back several hours later, everyone was
there and seated around a small fire. Jesus was curiously
observing each face one after the other, as if seeking an answer
to some private question, a sort of vacant look on his face, an
expression of disbelief; but he was mercifully silent. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We slept on the beach that night, gazing at the
million sparkling stars, thinking, wondering, seeking answers to
man's age-old question 'What is the secret of this universe in
which we live?' until, exhausted, we finally fell asleep. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We returned to Vava'u the next day. The boy Jesus
seemed a little embarrassed by what he had said and done, but
soon we had him laughing at his own stupidity. He later told me
he had been a divinity school student for two years before
switching to social science, but after this 'trip' he wondered
that perhaps he ought to have stayed on and become a minister. I
told him that he could be anything he wanted, this time around.
Besides, he was probably serving God better by helping teach
Tongans how to run their social services than preaching his word
each Sunday in church. I gave him my copy of the New Jerusalem
Bible. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But it was all too good to last. Already there was
gossip on the main island about the Peace Corps growing pot on
Vava'u, and now rumour had it that they were taking LSD. This was
confirmed when I received a note from the British Consul saying
that some questions were being asked about me and the purpose of
my stay in Tonga. He was also in possession of a file from the
Foreign Office, and the local CIA had filled in a few more
details. Would I care to visit him to discuss the matter? It was
exactly one month since I first arrived in Tonga when the
Minister of Police and about a dozen detectives arrived on Vava'u
and started searching for the marijuana beds. The Peace Corps
were clearly implicated, and a cable was sent to Washington to
this effect. By return came a cable from the Peace Corps Director
asking that they return to Washington immediately, when there
would be a hearing before the committee. As for myself, I decided
to leave before I was kicked out, and soon I was on the jet, this
time for New York, where at least it was still possible to smoke
pot without getting paranoid, as now even office girls were
smoking the stuff, which meant nearly everyone in the city was. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the fellows from the Peace Corps? It seemed
that they had not returned to Washington as instructed but had
decided to live in Fiji instead, turning on the local Peace
Corps, as well as their former colleagues on holiday from Tonga.
Again and again I am surprised at the effect that LSD has on
people's lives, how it seems to change their directions or goals,
making it somehow impossible for them to exist in the formal,
structured world so favoured by the Establishment. In this case
what a few micrograms of LSD had done was to transform a bunch of
ordinary, middle-class Americans with clear-cut expectations and
achievement-motivations into missionaries of a new order, for
they were now possessed of a self, or of a self-conscious similar
to that of the mystics, <i>rishis,</i> and saints. How was such a
change accomplished? Only by the realisation of the God within,
and by the willingness to accept the validity of this vision, and
moreover by the ability to re-create this insight as immediately
in terms of a living manifestation: they have made of themselves
whatever art it is in the life of each one of them, unconcerned
with the trappings of outer forms or appearances: they live
according to an inner rhythm, not that of the metronome but of
music. They had recognised the Atman within themselves, and now
wanted to realise him in the world; they wanted to assist Brahma,
whose partial expression they believed themselves to be. </p>

<h4>CHAPTER TEN</h4>

<h3>THE CAPITAL OF KINGDOM COME</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<h4>1969</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The anti-diluvian DC-9 swam through a sea of milk
all the way from Delhi. It was only just before landing that the
clouds cleared for an instant and I saw the magical city of
Kathmandu cradled by the snowy ranges of the Himalaya&#151;a
non-euclidian landscape of terraced paddy fields surrounding a
dream form of pagoda-like temples and golden palaces, rising into
view and spinning from the horizon as the plane circled to land. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was thirty-eight, on my first visit to Asia with
New York left well behind, carrying a typewriter, some
hand-baggage, a few hundred trips of Californian 'sunshine' acid
which a friendly psychiatrist laid on me, and about $1000 left
from a colour video movie I made about tripping to the moon. It
was July 16, 1969, and my pilgrimage was destined to begin at the
precise moment of the Apollo 11 blast-off for man's first landing
on the moon. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At a more ordinary level, it was, I gathered later,
absolutely the wrong time to visit Kathmandu, as the monsoon was
imminent; the air was stifling with humidity and the bumpy taxi
ride from the airport made me sick; and I longed for some
air-cooled Manhattan bar where a couple of iced lagers could
revive a sorely tried spirit. Whatever expectations of romance I
had nursed had been shrivelled in the heat by the time I reached
my hotel. I had the insane urge at this point to drive straight
back to the airport and continue to Bangkok, settle down to a
routine English-teaching job, get rid of my beard and long hair,
become super-straight, like my friends Al Cohen and Richard
Alpert, and maybe continue to Australia &#133; but as the beauty
of the valley began to exercise its subtle magic through the
windows of my room, I just knew that this was indeed the one
place in or out of this world where I wanted to be. I took a
bath, changed into a Tibetan shirt and Indian <i>dhoti</i>&#151;a
sort of bin cloth you wrap around yourself&#151;smoked a couple
of chillums of good Afghani dope; and nearly fainted in dream of
dreams. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The view through my window was brilliant with the
afternoon sun. Amazement was the first element of my muted
delight at these bright green paddyfields between myself and the
snowcapped ranges still visible through the shimmering heat; and
mystery, of what lay beyond them, unseen&#151;the distant
half-chartered ranges of Tibet, home of the fable-seeking
imagination. The spell of the Himalayas was upon me. The beauty
of my surroundings began to penetrate a hardened carapace, for
these mountains had begun to exercise a magic thraldom all their
own. And now I was part of it. In some way which I could not
rationally explain, I just knew that I was gazing at the
mysterious container of the history of the world, the magical
amphitheatre in which Siva dances with Nataraja. I was a visitor
in the ancient land of gods and abode of <i>rhishis, tapaswis,
sadhakars,</i> saints and philosophers who come to meditate in
glacial deserts to make their beings as pure as the snow which
covers the tops of their sacred mountains and their minds as
clear and transparent as the water of the holy lakes... they
offered their adherents a way of life, a path to happiness: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'In the body as it is in reality are contained all
worlds, mountains, continents and seas, the sun and the other
constellations . . . ' says the <i>Pretakalpa</i> of <i>Garuda-Purana.</i>
I also had a sense of what was meant in the passage from the
Hindu epic <i>Ramayana:</i> 'He who but thinks of the Himalayas
does greater things than he who is destined to tarry in Benares'.
And, by implication, he who tarries in Canterbury, Rome, Salt
Lake City, Belfast, and Jerusalem. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I realised with an immediacy akin if not identical
with revelation that I had travelled halfway across the world to
find in Kathmandu what I sought in vain throughout my wanderings
in the West. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were certain immediate needs, however, like
scoring some local hashish, for which Nepal was rightly famed.
And some more suitable clothes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was still early, and even if it was like a
furnace outside, I decided to venture forth into the maze of
dusty streets and alleyways, all somewhat reminiscent of the
imaginary Baghdad of <i>The Arabian Nights.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The city is not very large and within a matter of
minutes I found myself in the central square. It was like
something out of the Middle Ages, with street vendors sitting by
their piles of cloth and vegetables and boxes of cheap ornamental
beads, with enough activity going on to keep the eye fully
occupied. A huge bull emerged suddenly from the crowd, sedate and
reasonable, wandering with the scores of shoppers, even
defecating without so much as a pause, unnoticed, except, that
is, by myself. The houses were of red brick, all built in a
strange pagoda style which eliminated straight lines, with
latticed windows and overhanging balconies, many with hanging
potted plants. There were temples and delicate <i>stupas</i>,
huge sculptured statues, beautifully proportioned by some
anonymous race of master artists. The faces of these deities seem
self-absorbed in contemplation; sharp cheeks and supple chins in
the case of the male gods, and sweetly smiling lips, sensitively
sloping fleshy cheeks with elegant curves in the case of the
females. Some of the faces had been almost worn away through the
passage of time, which gave them a special mystery. Yet each
one&#151;and there were hundreds&#151;was strangely complete in
itself and fostered the message of the divine. But what was
interesting was to see how they were still objects of veneration
and worship by the people. There was one in particular that
caught my eye, a sculpture of the god Vishnu, the divine ruler of
the <i>Hindu Triad;</i> the face looked serious, with just the
right degree of rectitude and probity as befitted his position.
He had ear ornaments hanging above his shoulders and had all the
traditional attributes or <i>ayudas</i>&#151;the crown, the
necklace, the garland of flowers and the hip-belts, all
exquisitely shaped; the upper garment, the sacred thread or <i>yajnopavita</i>,
and the <i>dhoti</i> were emphasised with oblique lines through
the chisel-marks. In front was a rounded platform, a stone, for
rubbing and making <i>chandana</i> paste from sandalwood. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a glimpse of this Other World, of something
that I had seen and read about but had never had direct
experience of before. Here I could actually feel this something. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I still had to score some hash and get a Tibetan
shirt or two and a <i>dhoti.</i> I also wanted to discard my
shoes. I remembered that someone had told me that Rana's teashop
was a good place to score so along I went. It was up a tiny
alley, dustbin dirty and smelling of cow shit and urine. Outside
sat a small boy, a beggar, and I gave him a handful of rupees
before I went inside. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rana's was an extraordinary place. There was pop
music on twin speakers, very loud, and a few stone-topped tables
at which were gathered a group of perhaps fifteen young
Westerners, silent, smoking chillums, and oblivious. They were
dressed in a gay medley of Indian, Tibetan and Nepalese costumes,
bedecked with beads and beards. One of them looked up, smiled,
and handed me a chillum, which I smoked. The effect was
instantaneous&#151;I almost passed out, and had to sit down. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know how long I remained seated at the
table, perhaps an hour, perhaps two. The hash was the strongest
I'd ever had and completely immobilised me. Rana, the dapper
young Nepalese owner of the place, would come over every now and
then and ask if there was anything more I wanted. 'Tea?' or
'Porridge?' I merely shook my head and continued just sitting in
my utter stupor.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, I was able to stand up, and I indicated to
Rana that I'd like to buy some of his hashish. He brought out a
simple handheld set of scales and weighed a <i>tola</i>&#151;about
one-third of an ounce&#151;which cost me about four shillings.
Then I split. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was still in somewhat of a daze when I got back
to my hotel, and had to lie down again. It was dark when I
awakened. I decided to undress and go to bed. It was only eight
o'clock, but there was really nothing I could or wanted to do. I
was completely stoned. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I awoke at daybreak. The bright yellow sun flooded
through my windows and I felt wonderful. Today would be a good
day. And, as things turned out, it was. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I made a telephone call to the Royal Palace to talk
to Narayan Shrester, private secretary to the Crown Prince, who I
had known in Cambridge, Massachusetts, about one year ago. He
seemed pleased to hear that I was in Kathmandu, and said he'd
drop by the hotel to see me. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Narayan dropped by for lunch. He showered me with
smiles and greetings and love. And we had a great reunion,
recalling our past meetings at Harvard and lots of questions
about why I had come to Kathmandu. 'Why Kathmandu ? Surely there
must have been somewhere else?' was a characteristic question,
for I'm sure his own dream fantasies of paradise cities were
directed towards Paris or even San Francisco. I told him I'd come
in order to sort out 'my priorities', to gain a new amplitude, to
enjoy the experience of living in a foreign country, things like
that. I told him that even in the short space of twenty-four
hours I could not only see but actually <i>feel</i> that
indigenous and elusive quality in Nepalese life. It was that
quality, which hitherto I had only been told about but could
never really experience, which indeed has yet to be expressed
outside the occasional rare poem. He thought I should write a
book about Nepal. Then we laughed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During the lunch I brought up the matters of my
visa. I had, I told him, about $1000, and lots of enthusiasm
about starting a poetry magazine in Kathmandu. I had even got the
title&#151;<i>Flow.</i> I reminded him that one of the things we
had chatted about in America was the phenomenon of hippies and
how I had taken him around the various colleges and to private
homes so that he might better understand the new life-styles now
emerging in America and in Europe&#151;many tied into oriental
religions. Narayan&#151;who has a degree in English from Leeds
University had been tutor to the Crown Prince (now King Bihrendra
of Nepal), and I had been anxious for the Crown Prince to also
appreciate that, if these developments were to continue, new
possibilities for religious-minded Westerners would have to be
developed in India and Nepal, the two Asian countries which had
perhaps most to teach. Hippies were not long-haired layabouts in
most instances, but had chosen to spend some time in the East
living with and through the ordinary people, or in <i>Ashrams</i>
or monasteries; they had come to learn, as seekers, not as
tourists with lots of dollars to spend. And I was one of them. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He said that he'd discuss the matter of my stay
with the Crown Prince, and that I would be hearing from him the
next day. He envisaged no difficulty. As it turned out, I
received a year's visa, extendable at any time should I wish to
stay on in Nepal. It was something I had cause to be very, very
grateful for indeed, as visa formalities can and usually do
involve a certain amount of hassle with the authorities, with
something like six weeks considered to be about the average
length of stay permitted at that time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Narayan had a little Volkswagen and offered to drop
me somewhere. I said I'd like to see one of the museums, so he
drove me a mile or two outside the city to the National Museum
near SwayambhuNath, one of the Holy Buddhist Centres of Nepal. He
himself had to get back to the Palace. He had given up his job as
English Lecturer at Tribhuvan University and was now private
secretary to the Crown Prince&#151;which meant he had to work
that much harder! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The exterior of the museum was in the traditional
Nepalese style of architecture and beautifully preserved. And as
I walked around inside, gazing at the sculptured Hindu Gods, the
bronze figures of the Goddess Curga, prayer necklaces of <i>Rudraksa</i>
beads, incense burners shaped as the tree of life, and paintings,
I was glimpsing into a past that was still very much a living
present, for here was a highly developed, sophisticated art
tradition that had reached perfection when Nepal had been the
flower of a great Asian civilisation. I looked at the statue of
Vishnu, this one dating from the fifteenth or sixteenth
century&#151;it was very massive and majestic, standing
completely erect on a bold-relief lotus-flower, and flanked on
either side by his two female consorts. The female deity at his
right hand held a chalara or 'fly-whisk' (I suppose that even the
most powerful of Gods were not totally immune to the ubiquitous
valley mosquito) and a lotus flower. The female at his left
carried a lyre in her hands pressed closely against the breasts
and the belly. But the real beauty was in the faces and forms of
Vishnu's consorts&#151;their slender waists and exceptionally
beautiful and delicate breasts conveyed their profound feminine
frailty.... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At closing time I stepped out once more into a
daytime present 'when the mountains were again the mountains; the
clouds were again the clouds'. A car sped by on the tiny road in
front of the museum. I suppose I <i>could</i> have been run over.
For what I was still experiencing was this profound sense of
somehow living the continuation of a glorious past in the
present&#151;which is something that no Western museum had ever
done for me, being, for the most part, 'dead' places. I don't
think I shall ever again experience anything more radiant than my
visions of that afternoon in my life. I just knew that I should
no longer feel 'alone', which is to live in my own naked
spiritual reserves, that the body-mind was capable of being
filled up again with the light through the simple process of
looking. How easy it all seemed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I ambled along the road like an old priest,
stopping now and again to observe the view, the bloom of a wild
rose, a particularly wondrous cloud structure. And since I was
walking in the direction of the Buddhist temples of Swayambhu, I
decided to proceed into the village. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But first a stop at the <i>chi</i> or teashop.
There was a group of heads sitting on a bench outside, chewing
the breeze, smoking the indigenous chillums, and several more
inside, in the cavernous half-light. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No one was talking much; it was considered a
'downer'&#151;bad form&#151;to use words, but communication was
no less intense for all that. The young Nepalese owner came
outside with a mug of thick tea, dark brown and very sweet, and
asked if I'd like anything. I shook my head. He smiled, and
disappeared into the dark interior of his teashop. The fellow
sitting next to me passed me a joint. His eyes stared at me
widely, his mouth still hung open as if to keep the last word of
his sentence in mid-air. Everyone here believes in all the magic,
I thought. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I took a couple of deep tokes. 'Good grass,' I
said, handing him back his huge seven-skin joint. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He looked at me. And I was reminded of a French
poem I'd read somewhere &#133; 'in the depths of a dilated pupil
shines the lamp of the poor'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As I got up to leave, he asked whether I'd been to
the <i>Bakery Ashram</i> yet, and he pointed to a small
passageway between two buildings. 'Just follow the path and take
a left when you get to the temple. They've got a new sound
system.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since I was stoned anyway, and since I had nothing
particularly to do, I decided to follow the path to the <i>Ashram.</i>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I heard the electronic music quite clearly through
the natural sound of Buddhist chanting outside the temple, and,
following the path, came suddenly upon a compound garden filled
with lots of young Western heads, all dressed in their <i>dhotis</i>
and Tibetan shirts and Indian silks. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Ashram</i> comprised two principle
buildings, one, a former factory of the now bankrupt SwayambhNath
Bakery concern, and the other, a long shed. And it was from the
shed that the sounds came. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Inside, seated quietly in a circle round a central
fireplace, were about twenty people, mostly male. There were
several chillums being passed around simultaneously. Room was
quietly made for me to join this charmed circle. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The two five-feet Sony speakers made all verbal
communication impossible. It was like sitting on stage with the
Stones. The sound of the music eclipsed all cognitive function.
It was like a river into which you had been plunged. And all you
need do was float, float, F-l-o-a-t. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hours&#151;maybe even days&#151;passed in an
instant. Time ceased to exist for those of us who sat stoned in
our mystical ring round the fire. And it was with this insight
that I was born into a new world. A new form of consciousness had
taken over, that we were somehow all together because in some
strange way we had been <i>brought</i> here. It was as though a
gust of wind had come from another existence, and had plucked us
from the streets of Rome and London and Detroit, and propelled us
to this Himalayan valley; our new myth-mother. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It had grown dark outside, and the people who had
been in the garden, now crowded inside the <i>Ashram.</i> The
smell of food from the far-end, invisible through the haze of
wood-smoke and hashish reminded me that I had not eaten all
afternoon. Soon there were people sitting around with plates on
their laps eating rice and vegetables with chopsticks. I saw a
line of people with empty plates in their hands, so I got up and
joined them. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Ashram</i> provided one sensible meal a day,
in the evening which cost one rupee to anyone who could afford
it, otherwise it was free; tea was a few cents extra. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After we had eaten dinner, the poet Kristof walked
across to the record player and switched it off. He returned to
his place in the circle. There was a hush, a stillness, a sense
of expectancy. Kristof announced that he was going to read a
'love poem', which he had just finished writing. Everyone looked
up smiling when Kristof finished; he was assuredly one of their
verbal magicians. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a strange place this salamandrine <i>Ashram</i>
of glassy eyes staring from fiery lake beside the sound of music
through my leafy dreams &#133; but soon the speakers were back on
again at full blast, so I decided to make my way back to the
hotel. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was dark when I stepped outside, and it was with
great difficulty that I found my way down and on to the road
again. Swayambhu is about two miles from the city, and I walked
slowly, savouring the stillness; no sound from anywhere; even the
dogs were quiet as I made my way through the maze of tiny streets
and alleyways. The city was almost deserted, yet it could not
have been much later than ten o'clock. It reminded me of the City
of London at night or downtown New York, after the crowds of
office workers had long since gone, the same sort of eerie
stillness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Back in my hotel room, I smoked a nocturnal chillum
and then got into bed with a manuscript translation of some poems
by the Nepalese master poet, Bhanubhaka Archarya, which Narayan
had left with me. There was an interesting description of
Kathmandu a century or so back which the poet compared with the
Celestial City of Alaka (the god of wealth); he also noted its
resemblance to Lhasa, Lucknow and <i>London.</i> And it was with
these images in my mind that I fell asleep. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was awakened in the morning by a knock at the
door. I stumbled out of bed and opened the door, expecting to
find a cleaning-woman. But, no, it was a young, handsome man who
introduced himself in perfect English as Madhusudan Thakur from
Northern India, a Brahmin, and former English lecturer at
Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, and a Sanskrit scholar. He had
been given my name by Narayan, who had suggested we might have
much in common. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I apologised for the state of my book-strewn room
and invited him in. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madhu, as he called himself, began to tell me a bit
about his life. He had studied English in Canada for three years,
and was now into translating Nepalese poetry into English. He was
also working on some Sanskrit translations. But what fascinated
him most was the increasing number of young Westerners living in
Kathmandu, and their impact on the cultural life of this city.
For Kathmandu was the 'third eye' of Asia, and the eye that gets
in when reality gets out. It had a special place and played a
special role in Asia. In fact, he had written an article on young
Western visitors for the leading intellectual monthly magazine <i>The
Rising Nepal</i> and wanted me to look over the manuscript. It
was entitled 'Kathmandu: A Coincidence'. Would I like to hear
bits of it ? Sure, I said He began to read: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'It happened only the other day by what is called in
    northeastern India a Samyoga, fair coincidence. At a public
    place in Kathmandu, two elderly gentlemen debated, and I
    overheard them in spite of myself. They were discussing
    whether the large group of young unkempt visitors from the
    West now in Kathmandu had any principles guiding their visit
    to the East. The gentleman whose tone of voice caught my
    attention first was saying &quot;Iniharuko kehi pani
    siddhanta chhai na&quot;, meaning &quot;These people have no
    principles at all, you know''. He seemed to be informing his
    friend, who, however, paid little attention to his
    companion's tone and presented his view of a whole ideology
    motivating and guiding these young people and their venture
    abroad. They were, he said, on a very important mission
    indeed. Life in the West had lost its meaning for them and
    they had come out here to seek and find new meanings, fresh
    perspectives, among the cultures of the East in art,
    religion, philosophy, in traditional, time-honoured ways of
    living, in forms of life and manner still untouched by the
    sick hurry and commercialism of modern Western civilisation:
    indeed, they were true seekers. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'A cross-section of the people under discussion
    sat close by, blissfully unconscious of the conversation that
    went on around them. I sat between them and wondered. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In fact, I continue to wonder. Personally, my
    time in the West, my memories of looks and words after every
    talk I gave on religious texts, philosophical questions and
    so forth, convince me that the Western youth today is truly
    seeking. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The scene in Kathmandu, despite our cynical
    gentlemen, remains positive and exciting. Potentially, here
    is a situation which is a counterpart of a movement to
    preserve and promote our ancient heritage such as the ideal
    of a new Sanskrit University. The readiness with which
    Western youth is willing to accept and undergo, even though
    temporarily, extreme physical hardship is simply amazing if
    one considers the conditions in which they have grown up.
    Living in a world without plumbing and central heating can
    indeed be for the group under discussion a &quot;spiritual
    experience&quot; in itself. It is hard to believe that the
    sacrifice this entails could be motivated simply by the
    desire for cheap travel around the world. The passionate
    interest in religious cultures not their own is a fact about
    young people today which should be given immediate
    recognition. A new faith is arising and demands, even in its
    present rudimentary forms, that we try and understand
    ourselves in terms of the traditions in which others have
    been nourished. The prejudices aroused by the long hair and
    beards notwithstanding, it is evident to those who look and
    listen that there are a certain number of genuine Sadhakas,
    seekers, among these people. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Even if life in the West has not lost its
    point for some, one can see and feel what some of the major
    political events of the past few years must have done to the
    more sensitive and intelligent youth of the countries
    involved and responsible for these events. No one who has
    observed for himself the mass madness let loose by alcoholism
    and sexual licence in Western cities, all part of the vast
    and complex money game, can help looking at the psychedelic
    movement in a new light. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I have no wish to saddle our friends with a
    &quot;philosophy&quot; not because I think there is no
    philosophy motivating them, but because the quest is still
    very much on. The gains of the last few years are still in
    the process of being recorded, the story is yet to be told.
    We might indeed be living right in &quot;the middle of
    things&quot;, to use a Jamesian image, since Kathmandu
    promises to become, for some of the characters in the play,
    the capital of the new world.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was very impressed, and said so. I told Madhu
that I thought we were all on some kind of sort of quest and had
found in Kathmandu the perfect place to start. Kathmandu was a
city of refugees, the new Jerusalem of the <i>Sadhakas,</i> who
had come to savour of the fruits of Paradise. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We ordered dinner in our room, and were now
perfectly relaxed in each other's company. I liked him. He was
open and honest and a man for whom the invisible world was
obviously visible. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I told him that I was planning to bring out a
poetry magazine, but needed more material, especially modern
Nepalese poetry. I proposed to include material from the West
dealing especially with the nature of the spiritual quest,
including some essays by myself on the phenomenon LSD. I said it
would serve a two-fold purpose. First, it would introduce
Nepalese poetry to Western readers and second, it would enable
Nepalese readers to orient themselves to the psychology and
background of their young visitors. I had a little money, and
since printing was cheap in Kathmandu, I already had enough to
cover costs. Madhu said he'd be very interested indeed to help in
any way, and that he was already working on the English
translations of several poems. And thus began a partnership that
resulted in the publication of <i>Flow One</i> several months
later. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One thing led to another, and before long we had
also agreed to start a centre for both Western and Eastern
seekers, especially those who wanted to learn Sanskrit. Madhu
emphasised the importance of Sanskrit amongst the intellectual
artistic circles as well as in the higher levels of Government
and at the Palace. Sanskrit played the same role here as Latin
did in the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, it was a sort of <i>lingua
franca</i> of any philosophical discussions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He said that Narayan would almost certainly be
interested in hearing about such a project, and maybe could even
get the Crown Prince as its patron. Could we draft an outline
proposal, since he would be seeing Narayan for dinner later that
evening, and would like to have him put it before the Crown
Prince ? The sooner we acted, the sooner the project could get
official sanction. I would also need permission from the Prime
Minister to publish, but he didn't foresee that there would be
any problem. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madhu went downstairs to make a few telephone
calls, and I cleared the desk and prepared a chillum to
facilitate the creative processes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Madhu returned, he looked very excited. Yes,
Narayan would like to see the proposal this evening. And he had
had some luck. He had called Balakrishna Sama, the Vice-President
of the Royal Nepalese Academy, who wanted us to come over to his
house for afternoon tea and for a chat. Madhu said that
Balakrishna was one of the truly great poets of Nepal, and
certainly of international stature. The problem was that
Balakrishna wrote his poetry in Nepalese or Sanskrit, though of
course his English was perfect. As a result, he was virtually
unknown outside his own country, a situation Madhu planned to
rectify by translating into English all his work written over the
past sixty years. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He brought up a chair to the desk, and we began to
formulate the proposal. Madhu didn't smoke hash himself, but had
no objection if anyone else did. After a couple of chillums and
an hour's discussion, we had agreed upon the main details, and
all that now remained was to write it. We addressed it to His
Royal Highness, The Crown Prince of Nepal. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When we finished, Madhu suggested that we should go
round to see Balakrishna Sama who lived at the other end of town,
not far from the Chinese Embassy. We took a taxi and within ten
minutes were walking up the drive of his house; with Hindu
statues in the garden and a huge <i>Garuda</i> bird painted on
the door. I was already impressed. The house itself was large,
half-timbered like a medieval manor, two or three storeys high,
and painted white. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A servant let us in and ushered us into one of the
downstairs living rooms. He said his master would join us in a
moment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The room was like a miniature museum with statues
of stone and bronze of the various Hindu pantheon, paintings and
early Nepalese iconography; books in Nepalese, Sanskrit, English
and French, and, nicely laid out on a silver-topped table, a
Victorian tea-service. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We had to wait only a minute or two before the poet
entered. He made a short bow and shook hands with us and
apologised for keeping us waiting. His English, like so many of
the cultured Nepalese, was almost entirely without accent, and he
spoke it with feeling, spontaneously, and without affectation. He
was perhaps seventy years of age, delicate and radiant with
health, and had the face of a man who had obviously lived a life
of the mind, very sensitive and aristocratic, as though his inner
and outer worlds matched. He was dressed in shiny blue silk in
the traditional Nepalese dress, and I felt that I was in the
company of an exceptional, rare person, perhaps even a saint but
certainly a wizard of some sort. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He seemed very pleased to see us, especially Madhu,
whom he embraced warmly as he beckoned us to the tea-table. His
servant appeared with a silver tea-pot, and a plate of cakes and
toasted scones. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madhu then started to talk about the Himal Centre
project, and to read him bits of our afternoon's work.
Balakrishna was most attentive and sympathetic and said that he
would certainly encourage a centre such as we had outlined. The
only problem he thought was the financial one. He made a few
calculations on a sheet of paper and said that for the
scholarships alone we would need $595,000. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madhu said that although $500,000 might sound a
like a lot of money, in reality it was not too much if one
considered the possibility of help from some of the larger
American Foundations, who were used to giving away much larger
sums for less realistic projects. I remained silent, though I
nodded in agreement with Madhu's analysis. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We then began to discuss the envisaged poetry
magazine, <i>Flow,</i> which Madhu briefly described. Nepal,
being a country in which poetry was highly esteemed, had a lot to
offer, and it would make sense to make available some of the best
Nepalese poetry in English, as well as make available
contemporary Western poetry to Nepalese poetry lovers.
Balakrishna then turned to me and asked in his quiet, pleasant
way, what the editorial policy might be and whether I thought
Nepalese poetry was sufficiently good to warrant translation into
an international language like English. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was pretty stoned and my mind was already soaring
into giddy heights of inspiration. <i>'Flow</i> is essentially a
magazine of poetry, art and religion, and we should dedicate it
to the man of tomorrow who has understood the burden of his dim
past, synthesised the heritage of his many cultures, solved the
crises of the present age and lives according to his genius!' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Balakrishna smiled broadly, and said that Camus,
the French Existentialist, had probably meant something similar
when he had noted somewhere that 'Real generosity towards the
future lies in giving all to the present'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I then asked the poet whether he would read some of
his poems, but he demurred, saying his English was not really
good enough to express his meaning, though Madhu could read
something if he wished. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madhu pulled out a fistful of manuscripts from his
briefcase. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'I think I'd like to read a verse from your most recent
    poem, which I have just finished translating&#151;<i>To Soma,</i>
    which was, I believe, inspired by the recent Apollo 11 manned
    trip to the moon. But I think I ought to explain for the
    benefit of Michael here, that the word <i>Soma</i> in
    Sanskrit also means &quot;moon&quot; as it is also associated
    with the sacred elixir of the gods of Vedic times. It was the
    fruit from the mystical tree of knowledge which, when taken,
    loosened the &quot;Tongue of the Way&quot; and in this sense
    would correspond to the Greek ambrosia, the elixir of
    immortality from the stream of Castalia under the Temple of
    Diana. ' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madhu stood up, bowed graciously to the poet, who
sat silent, his face grave and serious &#133; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Sweetly, O Soma, do I remember you again today, <br>
    Over the last half-century have I been<br>
    Drinking you in, drop by drop, unceasing, ecstatic! <br>
    Once again, O Soma, I grind your vine,<br>
    Grind it with my heart, filter it through my viens, Mingle it
    with my vision and my breath,<br>
    To fill the amphora of my heart to the brim! <br>
    O Soma, soaked am I to the very depths<br>
    In the sweet shower of your beams<br>
    Drawn deeply by your gravity,<br>
    Exhilarated, breathless as I swing <br>
    And go steadily gliding, gliding,<br>
    I too fly upwards with Apollo Eleven! &#133; ' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a long poem followed by a long silence, and
we all looked as if something very special had happened, like the
shock following upon a great discovery. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Impatient or unwilling to remain silent, I finally
broke the spell by saying that it was one of the most incredible
poems that I had ever heard, and that I wanted to put it into the
magazine for the world to read. I also added, by way of a
comment, that I had arrived in Kathmandu on the very same day
that Apollo 11 had blasted off for the moon. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Balakrishna then said, looking at me straight in
the eyes, though centred in the middle of my forehead: 'A most
auspicious omen for you.' </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was time to go, and we stood up, bowed and
took our leave. Madhu danced down the driveway, obviously pleased
by our reception. There were no taxis in sight and I told Madhu
that I'd really prefer to walk back to the hotel, which was fine
with him. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The evening breeze made the walk bearable, and I
felt very good indeed. We talked a lot on the way about the
magazine, the shape it should take, who might be able to print it
in English, things like that. But my mind was strangely
elsewhere, as if the experience with Balakrishna Sama had been
more than simply meeting a master poet. I felt very close to the
man in some odd, unaccountable way. Perhaps in him I had at last
found my 'guru'? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We soon reached the centre of the city, and taking
Madhu back into my confidence, I asked him whether he could find
me a house to rent, somewhere nice, perhaps on the edge of the
city, and with many rooms. Madhu said he'd look into it
immediately. We said goodbye at Kanti Path, and I cut across the
park in the direction of my hotel. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a beautiful evening, cool and pleasant in
the evening light, the mountains still visible as silhouettes in
the far distance. I again experienced that expansion of feeling,
a new mental amplitude, difficult to describe but quite intense.
It was my own self reborn out of the vibrations of this holy
city; it was my own self which warms in the sun, refreshes in the
evening breeze, glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees....
In the distance I heard the sound of a temple flute and bell and
the song of the cicada as it sung itself &#133; utterly &#133;
a-w-a-y. Why grasp so earnestly after hallucinations and flowers
in the air when it was all here, at one's feet ? For as one's
sense of reality deepends, which it does with age, one's need to
integrate with the world is very great indeed. And I felt that at
least here, in this Paradise city, I should make myself yet one
more dwelling place. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Back in my hotel room, after a light dinner of rice
and vegetables, contentedly I prepared a chillum, and poured out
some fruit wine. How otherwise shall we take our pleasure here
&#133; and if ever I am asked again 'What for the future?' it
will be with a finger pointed to the moon that I shall reply.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Three months later &#133;</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The monsoon was over. The air was as clear and
fresh as Vichy water. I had rented the lower two floors of a
large house called 'Shangri-La' in Bijuswari, a secluded suburb
of Kathmandu close to Swayambhu. The house belonged to the
Nepalese Director of Tourism, Tirtha Raj Tuladhar, a Buddhist and
a man of great personal charm and sensitivity, who had translated
many of King Mahendra's poems into English. And from my window I
had a clear view across the valley to the distant snow-capped
peaks of the high Himalayan range. The house stood by itself in a
narrow lane which was really a cul-de-sac and was thus unvisited
by motorised transport, except once in the morning and once in
the evening when a chauffeur-driven car came to pick up and
deliver the Tourist Director. It was a haven of stillness, and
the only sounds you heard were natural ones&#151;of birds, or
animals or passing people. There was a large meadow extending
across the lane; and a large well-kept garden immediately in
front of the house, which seemed forever ablaze with flowers,
especially roses, which the tourist director would tend for hours
at a time, removing by hand, bugs from the petals and leaves, one
at a time, never killing them, but putting them on a sheet of
paper and every now and then blowing them off into the winds of
fate or fortune. A typically Buddhist gesture. An orchard of pear
and apple trees flanked either side of the house and at the very
rear, beyond the back garden was a small <i>stupa</i> of
exquisite design. It was an ideal place to be. This was my
landscape, the one that absorbed me, with joy, into the hot blood
of myths and gods, back into the roots of total being in which,
at times I could truly believe that there was no longer any 'I'
or 'me' but that I was somehow the All. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in the mornings, with my rooms filled with
bright sunlight and the sound of temple bells opening the well of
my ears, I could feel that inexpressible peace &#133; as: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Unseen today<br>
    In brightest sunlight, and yet<br>
    Today how beautiful, Mother Nepal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was learning that man is born in ignorance of his
element, and must somehow find it, like the cygnet finds the
water. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My mornings would usually start early, shortly
after daybreak. I had a small paraffin burner on which I would
make my breakfast, usually a plate of porridge made from
water-buffalo milk, and several cups of tea, followed by a
chillum. I usually took this in the garden. I'd then try to work
a little on the magazine manuscripts before Madhu would arrive,
usually at about ten o'clock. It was an idyllic existence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kris, the poet, would usually join us for lunch,
and after lunch we would be joined by five or six other
Westerners for some Sanskrit lessons, which Kris had arranged. He
had a degree in Sanskrit from Oxford, and was a very patient,
clever teacher, who used his skill to get us to learn this
amazing language. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But mostly my time was taken up with the manifold
problems of getting the magazine together. We had found three
printers and had decided to parcel the material out as three
separate sections, which we would then assemble into the final
magazine. Already the shape of the magazine was discernible, if
in silhouette only, but the energy was there&#151;my slight
paranoia was that with the unlimited amount of hashish and LSD we
had, all this energy would dissipate before completion, for with
psychedelics the impetus to 'attend to business' is not always
present! So it was something of an effort of will, for I was
determined to get the damn thing published, even if it killed me,
which, as it turned out, it very nearly did through what you
would call over-indulgence in drugs (though other matters played
their part, like rising costs and two of the printers refusing to
print or return the manuscripts entrusted to them). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The least of my difficulties, surprisingly enough,
was obtaining official permission from the Prime Minister to
publish the magazine. I had been told by various people,
including the French Ambassador, that no foreigner had ever
received such permission, 'not even the Americans'. And the
British Embassy was equally sure that I would be refused, though
in every other way they were most encouraging. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I needed, of course, someone who had access to the
Prime Minister and who was also a poet. And I found my man in the
person of Soorya Bahadur Singh. He was an extraordinary gentleman
in his late thirties, who worked in the Singha Durba, the
parliament building, and who wrote poetry in English. He came
round to see me one day with a pile of poems about one foot deep,
which he wanted me to publish. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Singh had connections inside the
Parliament&#151;his brother was private secretary to the King. So
I asked him to arrange for me to see the Prime Minister. This he
arranged in a matter of a few hours for the following day, which
didn't leave me much time to find something suitable to wear. My
normal dress was a Tibetan shirt and dhoti, a piece of coloured
Indian cloth wrapped around my waist, and my shoes had long since
been given away to a Tibetan Buddhist priest, who had wanted them
for his Rimpoche (a High Lama) as a gift. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, as soon as Singh told me that I had to
be at the Singha Durba at eleven o'clock the next morning, I went
into town to buy an outfit. I settled for what I was told was a
traditional Nepalese costume for formal occasions. It was made of
silver cloth and the trousers were right up to the knees and
opened up at the top like jodhpurs, together with a long jacket
nearly down to the middle of the thigh. The collar was tied by
means of ribbons. I also got a pair of cheap Indian sandals. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I spent most of the night preparing my brief, and
felt able to answer any questions the Prime Minister might put to
me. Mr. Singh came with a taxi at 10.30 to take me to the Singha
Durba. He seemed to be almost as nervous as I was. I had
difficulty getting dressed in my new Nepalese clothes&#151;the
legs were too tight, but I finally managed to get into them, and
off we set. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Singha Durba was an impressive building, huge
and in the style of architecture of the British Raj. The taxi
dropped us off at the main entrance. The entire building seemed
to be a labyrinth of corridors, and we walked rapidly, moving
through this maze, up stairways, down small corridors, along long
ones until we stopped before two huge polished mahogany doors
with a sparkling brass curved doorknob. Mr. Singh knocked, and we
entered. This was the Secretary's office. The secretary was a
pleasant young man, who smiled broadly when he saw me, and said
that the Prime Minister was expecting us. He disappeared for a
moment through another set of huge doors, and then came out and
indicated that we were to enter. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Prime Minister sat at a desk at the far end of
a palatial room. He was wearing a white open-necked shirt with
the sleeves rolled up. When he stood up to greet us, I noticed
that he was wearing ordinary Western-style navy blue trousers and
a belt. It was quite a distance from the door to his desk, but
already I sensed a <i>faux pas</i> on my part. The Prime Minister
began to smile as we approached and the smile gradually broadened
into a grin. By the time we reached his desk he was almost
uncontrollably shaking with suppressed laughter. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course I didn't know it then, but the costume I
had bought ready-made from one of the tourist shops was from a
period around about 1890&#151;as though in the West I had gone to
meet an official dressed up in a Dickensian outfit. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the broad grin was infectious, and I, too, was
laughing when we shook hands. Tears streamed down the Prime
Minister's face as he took the form that Singh handed him and
which he had to sign before we could officially go ahead with the
publication of Flow. He hardly glanced at it, and signing it with
a flourish, managed to say between giggles, 'I hope you don't
write anything bad about Nepal.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Singh then bowed and said that was all and that
we now had permission to print. I said I thought the Prime
Minister was an exceptionally jolly fellow. And Singh merely
nodded. He then asked me whether I'd like a tour of the building,
to which I readily assented. We must have walked three or four
miles through the endless lengths of corridors, and somehow ended
up walking along a subterranean corridor, lit by light coming
through tiny iron-barred windows. Singh said he had to see
someone for a moment, and we went into an incredibly small room
that seemed to be littered everywhere&#151;on the shelves, on the
floor, on the desks, with bundles of envelopes. There was a very
old man sitting at one of the desks, who barely glanced up as we
entered. 'This is the censor's office and this is the chief
censor. I think I will show him the Prime Minister's signature on
our document, just in case.' Singh said something to the Censor
and gave him the signed piece of paper. The Censor removed the
thin wire spectacles which he had been using to read the letters,
and produced a magnifying glass, and read the paper Singh had
handed him. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He nodded, dug out a stamp from a drawer, and after
putting some ink on to the pad, stamped the document. 'Now it's
completely official. We can publish anything we want.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was glad to get out of the building with its
associations of prison and other large institutions, and I
welcomed Singh's suggestion that we should go somewhere and
celebrate, which for Singh meant getting very drunk. I called an
American teacher friend and asked him if he could let me have a
bottle of whisky, explaining the purpose, for it was still not
yet noon. No problem. And by mid-afternoon we were both reeling
about the centre of Kathmandu singing songs and reciting poetry.
Finally we got to Rana's teashop, and stumbled in. All the heads
turned as we noisily entered. And on many of the bearded faces
was a look of disapproval. Rana's was a place for chillums and
pop music, not a bar. Singh insisted on having the music turned
off, then climbed on to the top of a table and, with tears
streaming down his face, said that never in his entire life had
he met such a great poet as Michael Hollingshead, and that it was
his wish that everyone in the teashop should stand up and sing
'God Save the Queen'. A few heads split immediately, sensing a
scene. And Rana just stood there watching, not knowing quite what
to do. Finally, I managed to pull Singh off the table and out
from the teashop into the yard. I then carried him to a taxi and
paid the driver to take him back to the Singha Durba to sleep it
off. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus the days passed into weeks and then
into months. By now we had a lot of material ready for the
printers. I had also got a translation of one of the King's
poems, which I decided to print in red. It was called <i>A
Self-Portrait</i> &#133; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Like the dark night I am <br>
    Whose moon has strayed away; <br>
    Like the wild withered tree <br>
    That all its leaves has lost. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>With rotten, hollowed roots, <br>
    Ready I am to fall; <br>
    A faded flower I <br>
    With none to care for me. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A blind man I who gropes <br>
    Fumbling the stark mid-path; <br>
    And such a burning fire<br>
    That has no warmth to give. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Ever am I in the mid-stream <br>
    About to sink beneath the waves; <br>
    I am a drowned soul, <br>
    Whose shore lies far away.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a very fine poem, and modest, considering
that King Mahendra was the supreme ruler of Nepal, and also
recognised as an incarnation of the Hindu God Vishnu. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had also had quite a few acid sessions during the
time I had been there was a constant stream of visitors coming to
'Shangri-la' to score some 'sunshine'. There was quite a bit of
acid in the city, mostly brought in by Californians or some of
the bigger dealers, who would exchange acid for hashish. I
believe LSD was known by the few Nepalese who used it as 'Western
hash'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was traditional to take LSD at full moon, and
people would congregate at the <i>Bakery Ashram,</i> and drop it
in the late evening so that they could listen to music during the
night, followed by a climb up to the Buddhist temples to join the
monks for early morning service. It was very rare that anyone
ever freaked out' or went berserk, though it could happen. I
remember a young Dutch boy who, when he got to the temple, took
off all his clothes and began running amok, knocking over prayer
bowls and trying to climb up on to the head of a huge bronze
Buddha. There was nothing we could do to quieten him down, and we
felt it had all gone a little too far. The monks, who had been
chanting during all of this had seemingly not paid any attention,
that is until the statue began to sway and it looked as if it
would come crashing down. About six monks suddenly moved across
to grab him, and gently they carried him back to the circle of
other monks. They then tied him up and gagged him and placed him
in the centre, and continued their <i>mantras</i> as if nothing
had happened. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But perhaps the thing that disturbed local people
the most was that, on average, one girl a month would flip out on
acid and insist on walking through the centre of the city
completely naked. I think the Nepalese were terribly shocked by
this, for often the girl would be extremely beautiful. I think
the syndrome, as far as one can say anything about human
behaviour, is connected with the notion of total freedom, the
freedom to walk naked being merely a manifestation of this wish.
Throwing off your clothes is an act of liberation. Or so someone
once told the young Californian girl whom I saw briefly just
before she was put on the plane to India, having been found by a
policeman wandering naked through the main street. I think there
was also a great fear on the part of the authorities that one day
King Mahendra might see such a spectacle, and that would create a
major incident, for the king had a habit of cruising the streets
at odd hours behind the wheel of his Ferrari. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, although I was not held directly
responsible in the case of the American girl, it had not escaped
the notice of the authorities that I was somehow involved with
the LSD-cult, as they called it. At first it had seemed innocent
enough, merely another religious group, who used something
similar if not identical to hashish, which had a place in certain
forms of Eastern worship. But this thing about girls taking off
their clothes every now and then had them worried. Consequently,
I was approached by one of the editors of the English language
daily, <i>The Rising Nepal,</i> who asked whether I would write
an article for the paper about what young Westerners were doing
in Kathmandu. 'It would help relations with the public very much
indeed; yes, really, very, very much. Thank you.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I did so, and called the article 'The Divine
Mutants' which was sufficiently obscure I thought, with still a
slight religious or spiritual bias. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'THE DIVINE MUTANTS </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The term, &quot;hippy&quot;, if a recent journalist can
    be believed was invented by the media so that ordinary people
    would have something to pray for salvation from. If so, and
    if the phenomenon &quot;hippy&quot; is the unholy invention
    if sub-editors and people with mass circulation magazines to
    sell, we ought to be able to look at the matter more
    objectively and see what myths and legends have sprung up
    around this strange creature. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'One thing is certain, however, there is an
    increasing acceleration of young people &quot;dropping
    out&quot; of our Western sort of society, who prefer to
    &quot;stand on their own two feet&quot; rather than have
    their lives directed from without, by the system
    (economic-political-social). This group, variously estimated
    (<i>Time</i> magazine) to be between seven and ten million
    under the age of twenty-six, has claimed new areas for its
    own. It has developed a new life-style or an existential mode
    of being which, if still lacking proper articulation, seems
    nonetheless to be an attraction for some of the most gifted
    and sensitive minds of our modern generation; there is
    something vital and energetic and intelligent about what
    these young people are doing. In the words of their
    &quot;High Priest'', Timothy Leary, who also coined their
    slogan <i>Turn On</i> (to your own nervous system) <i>Tune in</i>
    (to the energy within your own mind) <i>Drop out</i> (of the
    socioeconomic system): &quot;The generation born after 1945
    is perhaps the wisest and holiest generation that the human
    race has ever seen &#133; and, by God, instead of lamenting
    derogating, and imprisoning them, we should support them, all
    turn on with them.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Yet for those so identified by Leary, the
    &quot;dropping out&quot; foreshadows social developments
    which are bound to take place in Western society as a whole,
    for as automation increases and when only a small percentage
    of the people will do most of the work, leisure will be the
    problem or, rather, too much leisure, for the old ethic of
    work and salvation cannot survive in a society where perhaps
    only five per cent of the top executive and administration do
    all of the work- indeed, within the foreseeable future, <i>the
    big reward in life will be to be allowed to work.</i> <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Meanwhile, we are living in a strange
    confusing period of transition from one life-style to another
    quite different one. From the philosopher's point of view, I
    think, we are seeing a change in the nature of Western man
    due to a shift of emphasis away from a theological revelation
    to an ontologist mysticism, that is, authority of a Divine
    Person to the more individually &quot;free&quot; belief in
    absolute Nature. In either approach to God, we are reminded
    that we are summoned to a deeper spiritual awareness, far
    beyond the level of subject-object. One of the attractions of
    Central Asia for some of the young seekers is that the
    religions here see man's unity with God in an ontological and
    natural principle in which all beings are metaphysically <i>one.</i>
    Here there is unity in Absolute Being <i>(Atman)</i> or in
    the Void <i>(Sunyata).</i> <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'It is one way that still remains for Western
    man to save himself from becoming Reality's dupe, that is,
    the slave of some external control (which we see as an
    inevitable result of television, which keeps millions of
    minds literally imprisoned by invisible lines of pull and
    force, and soon there will be more sophisticated hardware,
    such as 3-D holography, where images will literally appear to
    be actually <i>present within you inside your living-room.</i>
    If you want to see an elephant, plug in the tape marked
    &quot;elephant&quot;and one will appear, hovering in your
    drawing-room and safe too. And it won't leave any mess to
    have to clear up afterwards. For such people, the cinematic
    world of labour-saving devices and the good health that goes
    with it is probably the best place to be.) &quot;A lifetime
    of freedom! Why, no man alive could stand it; it would turn
    his life on earth into a complete hell&quot;, says Bernard
    Shaw. And for the older, conservative members of society this
    is a fair observation. Freedom is too difficult for most
    people to bear, and for those who have lived a lifetime of
    conformity and spiritual neglect, freedom is impossible, that
    is, short of mystical revelation. The young man or woman is
    aware that as the political inhumanity of this century
    increases (with a corresponding erosion of certain liberal
    and humanist values) so too will the illegality of our
    various legal actions that seek to keep bodies of men
    pressing down on other bodies of men, and all for so little
    reason. Society, to such a young educated thinking person
    seems to be growing infertile, devoid of a living culture, no
    longer productive of any personal form, abstract, lifeless in
    the face of machine-made interpretations about the self, the
    world, and the other people in it. No wonder, then, if modern
    man sees himself as nothing but a cipher on the face of a
    moral and spiritual void. And as the knowledge of his own
    disorientation cannot be handled quantitatively, he turns
    more and more to his brave world of machines. And through the
    power of his machines he acts out the uncomprehended tragedy
    of his inner disruption. He is therefore cut off from any
    reality except that of his own processes, which he cannot
    understand, and his machines, which he can understand, but
    which cannot provide answers or even directions which would
    enable him to regain the former lost paradise of close
    contact with nature and the world of living things, including
    himself. As the Ancient Chinese sage, Shuang Tzu, discovered
    some 2500 years ago, dependence even on a simple kind of
    machine causes man to become uncertain of his own inner
    impulses, and he may even forget how to master his own world.
    Naturally, the advance of science and technology during the
    past 150 years is irreversible, and modern man now has come
    to terms with himself in his new situation. Yet he cannot do
    so, it seems to many modern thinkers, if he builds an
    irrational and unscientific faith on the absolute and final
    objectivity of a <i>scientific</i> knowledge of nature. For
    the study of man is also concerned with the core of the
    unknowable at the heart of man which cannot by its nature
    become the subject of finite analysis like a plant or animal
    species but is an area of human experience accessible through
    the intervention of a sacrament, which is whatever it is that
    helps make God present in man. (A sacrament is something that
    engenders in those who use it certain spiritual resonances
    which defy exact analysis and cannot be accurately described
    to one who does not experience authentically in himself.) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'And perhaps the start of any process of the
    personality towards independence, self-direction, and control
    must start with question and the search for an answer; with
    the question which again and again implies a calling in
    question the destruction of accepted ideas and stereotyped
    world-pictures and rote-learning and imprints&#151;in a word,
    revolution; the question that both cost Socrates his life and
    made it of such value. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'So perhaps we ought to look more kindly on the
    youthful pioneers who see our future world as one in which
    there is none but one, and each person owns nothing but the
    whole. And the phenomenon of so many young people who think
    this way is all the more significant if you take Kathmandu as
    an allegory of the possibility of conformity, not merely of
    one young growing person to one particular communal place or
    social development, but of a whole generation to a complete,
    if at times imperfect, greater society.' </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The editor seemed very pleased with the article and
asked whether I'd like to write more for them. I then wrote a
series on Tantra called 'Old Art in the Hands of New Artists
(Notes on the relevance of Tantra to Modern Western Art
Movement)' which they wanted to serialise over twelve issues. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tantra, in fact, had interested me a lot during my
stay in the East, and I had consulted both Lhasa-trained Buddhist
<i>tantrikas</i> as well as Hindu masters. There was also a
Western Hindu monk called Bhagawan Dass, from California, who
practised Tibetan Tantra vitally and who had a lot to tell me
about its left-handed aspect. It was also Bhagawan Dass who first
took Richard Alpert to his guru in India, Neem Karolli Baba.
Richard was converted into orthodox Hinduism and given the name <i>Baba
Ram Dass,</i> or 'servant of God'. He claims to be able to
maintain a 'forty per cent hashish high' <i>without</i> the use
of drugs or sex, which is admirable. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My talks with both Bhagawan Dass and Baba Ram Das
confirmed that their guru had used LSD: in fact, the first time
he did so was when Bhagawan introduced him to Ram Dass. The story
of what happened is now part of LSD lore, but is worth repeating,
even so. The guru asked about LSD, and Ram Dass said that it did
something equivalent to what he had read about in the writings of
the mystics, both Eastern and Western. The guru asked Richard, as
he then was, if he had any. Richard said he had six
'whitelightning' pills left, and that they were very powerful
indeed. The guru asked Richard to give them to him. And promptly
swallowed them. Richard sat silent watching for any sign. An hour
passed. Finally, Richard asked the Baba what effects he was
experiencing. 'None', exclaimed the guru. And Richard was
immediately impressed and declared his allegiance to the guru,
and gave him his Land Rover. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was very little interest in LSD amongst the
Nepalese, however, with one notable exception, Rama Prasad
Manandhar, who had been the Nepalese Ambassador in London for
seven years (he had once entertained Queen Elizabeth to dinner at
his London Embassy). Rama Prasad was a tantrika, a poet, and a
philosopher, a man of wide learning and culture, who lived in one
of the oldest and most beautiful houses in the city. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He came round to visit me one day, and a friendship
sprang up. One thing led to another and finally he asked me one
day whether he could try some LSD. We arranged a session at
'Shangri-la', and I told him the strength or dosage, and he
selected a dose of about 300 gamma, which was quite a lot for a
first trip. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The session was very quiet, meditative, and
serious. Rama Prasad did not talk very much. I remained totally
silent. About midway through the session, Rama Prasad complained
about being indoors, and said that he would like to go into the
garden. We walked into the garden together. It was a beautiful
afternoon of bright sunlight, and everything looked absolutely
radiant and perfect. Rama walked over to one of the roses upon
which a gorgeous butterfly had just alighted. And exclaimed: 'We
must try to expand the &quot;moment&quot; into infinite
duration!' He asked for a pen and paper and then wrote a poem,
which I reproduce exactly as he wrote it and as I published it
later in <i>Flow One.</i> It is called <i>The Moment</i> and <i>The
One-Ment.</i> </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was shortly after the Ambassador's session that
Rama Prasad came round to see me about arranging a meeting with
the celebrated Buddhist monk and saint, His Holiness&#151;Gyalwa
Karmapa, who was visiting Kathmandu and staying with the monks at
SwayambhNath. Rama knew Karmapa quite well, and had even
entertained him once at a reception in his town house. I was
naturally very interested in having an audience with Karmapa, for
I had heard and read much about him. He was the head of the
Kagyudpa Order of Tibetan Mahayana Buddhism, and recognised as
the sixteenth Karmapa incarnation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The audience was arranged for dawn on the following
morning, and Rama Prasad said he'd pick me up at my house in his
car. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I stayed up all that night, preparing myself for
the temple meeting, and performing chillum and acid Sadhana. When
Rama Prasad collected me, I was very stoned indeed, and could
hardly find my way out of the garden into the Mercedes. Then we
sped off into the blackness and reached the top of Swayambhu just
as the first light of dawn appeared through the gaps between the
surrounding mountains. It was a glorious sight. And I felt a very
special sense of reverence; there was a holiness about the place,
more intense than I had ever experienced there before; my head
and heart were open to anything. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We were taken up some stairs to the top floor and
shown into an antechamber where a monk tied a piece of orange
cloth around my neck. He then indicated that I should follow him,
and he led me from the chamber into a huge <i>sal</i> brilliant
with <i>tankas,</i> and murals, and statues. At the far end,
seated on a throne, sat Karmapa; and next to him, seated on a
cushion in the full lotus position, was Rama Prasad. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I approached Karmapa slowly, my eyes to the floor,
with short bows every few steps. When I reached the throne, I
looked up and saw a beam of bright light issuing from the centre
of his silver crown or it may have been a beam of sunlight
catching a reflection through the lattice-work windows. But the
effect was quite startling. It really could seem that he was
emitting light from his 'third eye' in the centre of his
forehead. I recovered from this startling hallucination,
sufficiently anyhow to hand him the white silk scarf I had
brought as a present. Karmapa then spoke to me through an
interpreter: 'According to the tradition since the Buddha, it has
been customary to preserve the record of gifts, as a token of
one's inner sense of benevolence. This is so that it may serve as
a historical record of the <i>Dharma</i> too. Your name will
therefore be added to the names of people contributing to this
tradition.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was then asked to say anything I wished to
Karmapa. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What I wished to say was for the future: to see
many of the Lamas and families of the esoteric <i>Dharma</i> move
to the West. And, how this work could be furthered by the lamas
opening a dialogue with the Chiefs and Elders of the North
American Indian Tribe called the <i>Hopi</i> whose villages I had
once visited in Arizona. The lands of the North American Indians
stretch from parts of Canada down to the Mexican border and
comprise some of the most beautiful countryside in the world,
parts of which are remarkably similar to Tibet, particularly in
Colorado and New Mexico. But these lands are now under siege
again, for, as the indigenous Indian population is encouraged to
leave the reservations and accept an alien white
culture&#151;which is happening in the case of the young Indians
at a truly frightening rate&#151;these holy lands will be taken
over in a few years by the U.S. Government, and then by the
builders. Yet potentially they could provide a sort of 'spiritual
backbone' for a future, more spiritualized America. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Karmapa remained silent throughout all this. When I
had finished, he beckoned me closer and, as I bent my head, his
hands touched the centre of my head, and suddenly, unaccountably,
like a bolt, I experienced <i>Samadhi</i> one of the most
extraordinary moments of consciousness of which man is capable.
And I felt utterly and completely cleansed, as though the divine
thunderbolt had gone through me like a million volt charge. It
was a feeling that was to remain with me for quite some days. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The memory of this great Initiation persists. I
believe that on that special morning when I met Karmapa my life
was changed and in ways that I am only now beginning to
understand, which I have yet to assimilate, and, in time, express
outwardly and through my being. For if ever there were a living
god, Karmapa is it: of this I am utterly convinced. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ninety-five per cent of all Buddhists, from Ladakh
to NEFA (North Assam) belong to the <i>Kargyudpa</i> esoteric
sect, of which Karmapa is the spiritual leader. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like all the other Karmapa incarnations, His
Holiness is famous for his erudite scholarship, integrity of
character, and excellence in yogic practices. The embodiment of
compassion, in human form, Karmapa cares for and loves all human
beings, and takes pains for their spiritual salvation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He is equally well-honoured and followed by Kings,
Lamas and laymen, in Tibet, China, Mongolia, India, Nepal,
Sikkim, Bhutan, as also throughout south-east Asia, Japan,
Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Canada, Great Britain, U.S.A., Sweden,
Denmark, Spain, etc., etc. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And daily now Karmapa prays for the world &#133;
'May all spiritual leaders enjoy long lives and prosperity. May
the <i>Singha</i> multiply and fulfill their duties. May the
blessings of the <i>Dharma</i> liberate all departed souls. In
the world may sickness, poverty, wars and all evil influences be
cut at the root and destroyed. May all things of the <i>Kali Yuga</i>
(Black Age) be dispersed.' </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, of course, the first number of <i>Flow</i>
appeared, minus about half the material, which two of the
printers had kept after I refused to pay increased printing
costs, which I considered to be very unfair. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the dedication read:</p>

<p> <center> TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS<br>
THE CROWN PRINCE OF NEPAL<br>
AND HER ROYAL HIGHNESS<br>
ON THE OCCASION OF THEIR MARRIAGE<br>
KATHMANDU &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
FEBRUARY 27, 1970 </center> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The days drifted lazily. I had made a number of
friends in Kathmandu, both Nepali and Western, and would often
spend pleasant afternoons walking around the city, occasionally
venturing forth to BoudhiNath, a small Tibetan settlement just
outside Kathmandu, with a characteristic huge <i>stupa</i> or
temple in the centre of the village, with three large eyes
painted on the top, which were visible from afar&#151;one of the
silent sentinels of Kathmandu Valley. It was a colourful
place&#151;the old Tibetan women slowly circumnavigating the
temple, spinning the eternal prayer-wheels, the men hanging
around in change shops, a few Easterners buying Tibetan ornaments
and clothes in the inevitable string of tourist shops. One of the
large houses around the <i>stupa</i> belonged to the Chini Lama,
and, having heard that the stupa had been recently struck by
lightning, I decided to pay him a visit one afternoon, for the
Chini Lama was like the unofficial mayor of BoudhiNath and the
guardian of the <i>stupa,</i> which he generously endowed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to local gossip the Chini Lama had been
doing a good trade moving <i>tankas,</i> Tibetan rugs, and
hashish and the lightning thunderbolt had struck the <i>stupa</i>
as art obvious warning from above. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Lama received me hospitably with the
traditional salt-and-butter tea, brought in by a lovely girl. As
we sat and talked, I was impressed by his incredible outfit,
which included orange-red robes in various silks, a fur hat, from
underneath which his smiling eyes looked at me with a penetrating
curiosity. I finally asked him about the lightning matter,
whereupon he told me that it was indeed an auspicious omen as he
had found a <i>Garuda</i> egg embedded in the <i>stupa</i> just
afterwards. I beheld in my stoned mind's eye a vision of a
mythical bird, for the <i>Garuda</i> is a familiar creature to
the readers of Hindu mythology, not unlike the phoenix in
appearance, whose wings are made of gold studded with diamonds;
so I suggested that I could arrange for an incubator to be sent
out to the <i>stupa,</i> if there were any real possibility of
hatching such an unusual bird as the <i>Garuda.</i> The Chini
Lama looked at me wistfully for what seemed like a long time and
finally said: 'I am afraid it is too late. I have already sold
the egg to a Hong Kong businessman. The shell is famed throughout
China as a great aphrodisiac. ' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We parted on the best of terms and he suggested
that I visit the monastery of Ogmin Chang Chub Choling,
established by a former Miami beauty Queen, Princess Zinaide de
Rachevski, who had been ordained into the Tantric Buddhist Order
by His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, who had also shaved off her head
of hair; and it was rumoured she was the first incarnation of
Madame Blavatski&#133; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a two-mile walk from the village, and I made
the ascent of the hill with some difficulty; the path was fairly
steep and narrow and I had to avoid occasional flocks of
descending goats and the occasional water-buffalo led by tiny
Nepalese children. The hill levelled out and soon I was inside
the gates of the monastery. The Abbess was sitting on the lawn in
a circle of beautiful girls with the occasional male <i>sadhu</i>
seated quietly within their midst. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I sat down next to Zina, as she liked to be known
by old friends (we had known each other briefly in New York, in
the mid-sixties, during her time there as a stunning East Side
socialite), and she told me many interesting things about the
training people received at the monastery, the essence of
transmission being telepathy or more exactly <i>darshan</i>&#151;a
kind of 'flash' or vibration that is transmitted in the <i>guru-gela</i>
relationship. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the resident Lamas, who had received his
training in Lhasa, now spoke a little English, and during the
course of the conversation I asked him about the Chinese invasion
into Tibet. The Lama gave me a curious answer: From one point of
view the invasion had been an historical tragedy, certainly for
the Tibetan people who were now scattered as refugees throughout
the Indian continent. Yet from another vantage point, the
'cosmic' one, this was all somehow necessary in order to spread
the <i>dharma</i> and make of this planet earth a Heaven for all
living creatures. 'The seven seals of silence were broken and a
new epoch would come.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now my time in this tiny Himalayan Kingdom had come
to an end. I had lived in Kathmandu for one year and had seen and
experienced many new things, and much had been given, more,
indeed, than I could ever hope to repay. But some inner
restlessness was calling me back to the West, and I decided to
follow its prompting. Thus it was on one sun-drenched morning in
August that I boarded the tiny DC-9 to Calcutta and thence by
connecting jet to London, arriving back in the metropolis the
next day as though in a foreign city, lost, and not a little sad
for what I saw&#133; . What had I really learned in my decade of
bizarre psychedelic trips? That it takes a great deal of acid to
produce even a little elevation of consciousness? That there are
times we can know more than we can tell? That reality must still
count for something? That it is impossible to become what one is
never not? That the future lies in a Tantric vision of cosmic
sexuality combined with a cult of ecstasy? That we can make of
the planet earth a Holy Land yet? Or is it with a finger pointed
to the moon that I should reply? But one thing is certain: that
there is no need to mean by a 'culture of humanity' anything more
than the liberation of the higher faculties. Whoever has any
experience in this matter will know how right Cato was when he
said: &#133; 'Never is he more active than when he does nothing,
never is he less alone than when he is by himself.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What at last is left for the psychedelic theorist ?
Must he honour the extreme doctrine of individualism and concede
that, after the elimination of radical evil and the provision of
material abundance, people must be left alone, simply to be and
do what they want ? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our mind craves dreams, those magical realms, for
ever present between somewhere and nowhere, which beguile us with
a thraldom all their own and help keep our sense of wonder alive.
And if the new 'matter-of-factness' encroaches on our brain to no
other end than to make of our life a thing and not, as it longs
to be, an instrument of self-transcendence, we feel distressed by
our inability to dream as once we did; and all delight is gone,
our life somehow diminished, which is the cause of most of the <i>angst</i>
in the self- the knowledge that what is most human in our life is
being determined not by our 'true' needs, which are divined from
the centre of our being, opening like the petals of the lotus and
are beyond thought, beyond intellect, 'beyond striving', but are
on the contrary, determined entirely by external forces, through
no choice of ours. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We are at once the victims and the beneficiaries of
modern technological advances. Reality is now the new myth-making
substance. We are manipulated by man-made dreams which develop
artificial wants: frozen and tasteless foods, bland, homogenised
lives; clich-ridden beliefs and standardised rituals;
conspicuous consumption; the 'pooled self-esteem' our Western
forms of nationalism make possible; mechanical gadgets; devotion
to science and the 'preality-principle'; and the abandonment of
any religious revelation, so that even our religious leaders and
intellectuals do not use words like 'spiritual' and 'idealistic'
at all freely, for they are themselves quite happy with their
material comforts and the labour-saving world of gadgets and good
health that goes with them, and would consider those who preached
that the happiness people want should be sought for in any kind
of <i>nirvana, mystic ecstasy, theoria, transcendence,</i> as
certainly other-worldly. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What the spread of technological culture has done
is to push the boundaries of the literal miracle, the
'other-world', the magical far outside the range of ordinary
everyday human happiness. Miracles, our politicians tell us, do
not originate in some supernatural religious state but must be
realised in this world and have their basis in the familiar facts
of technological progress, in communication, education,
transportation, public health, etc., etc. But those who have
found a source of happiness in a life of the spirit are of the
opinion that there has been a retrogression in our aim for a true
culture of humanity. While we are busily pouring ever-increasing
intellectual efforts into improving our means, we have forgotten
the ends they are intended to achieve. Do we really know what we
want ? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This question is more likely to be answered in the
Alternative literature of protest, the theme of vagabondage, and
the exploration of individual human consciousness via drugs, Zen
Buddhism, Yoga, esotericism, Buddha, the Hermetic arts, alchemy,
visionary experience, Tantra, <i>hesychast</i> methods,
hypostatic union of Christ and man, and all the charismas of the
spirit. Those who affirm that the real truth and source of all
human joy and happiness lies wholly 'within' must try, with
whatever means they can get, to break the hold of that view of
life which has replaced the potentialities of the human mind with
the perspective of its mechanical extensions, the extensions of
transportation and social planning and mass conditioning which
are now turning on the body and strangling it as the serpents did
at Laocoon. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Modern society is growing infertile, devoid of a
living culture, no longer productive of any personal form, an
abstract, lifeless, cinematic world of machine-made
interpretations about the self. It is not surprising therefore if
we tell ourselves that all revelatory experience is foolishness,
so much so that man sees himself increasingly as nothing but an
'energy slave' or a cipher on the face of a moral and spiritual
void. And as the knowledge of his own disorientation cannot be
handled within the framework of so-called normality, he turns
more and more to his brave world of machines. And through the
power of his machines he acts out the uncomprehended tragedy of
man's inner disruption. Yet it was the Ancient Chinese Sage,
Huang Tzu, who proposed some 2500 years ago that dependence even
on a simple kind of machine causes man to become uncertain of his
own inner impulses; and further, the result may lead him to
forget how to master his own world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So we have learned instead how to master our
machines, because machines do not serve us unless we service
them, but in the process we have had to adjust our human
organization to our equipment. We tend to get what the machine
can best give us rather than what is most desirable. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the rest &#133; I have tried to write this book
as an inwardly conceived and inwardly coherent work of fiction
that isn't exactly fiction, and only those who read it as a novel
will discover its real meaning. I hope that those who are
prepared to read the book in this spirit will catch a glimpse,
not so much of a utopia possible in theory, but rather of an
attitude of mind capable of attainment in practice, in which all
problems of modern technological existence will appear to be
solved, that irreconcilable contradictions will pass away, and a
newer and fuller significance of individual human existence will
be revealed. In this connection, I can do no better than to refer
the reader to Aldous Huxley's last novel, <i>Island</i> (1962),
which is a very imaginative effort to protect a way of life based
in nature, that is lived organically as a flowing growing
process. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to his brother, Sir Julian Huxley, Aldous
took LSD eleven times, gaining thereby 'new extensions of his
perception of beauty and transcendence'. Huxley believed that
from LSD the individual could achieve what the poet Cowper called
'a closer walk with God'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For myself, I believe I have investigated the
phenomenon LSD&#151;these words!&#151;as much towards this same
spiritual end as my intelligence and faculties permitted me to
go. And perhaps the long, arduous, oppressive decade I passed
through came to benefit at least one creative effort. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how do I now think of LSD <i>et al.?</i>&#151;as
certain truths about the nature of my inner self came to be
manifest in my conscious mind, my interest in psychedelics began
to wane proportionately, so that today I do not believe that LSD
can help me towards self-realisation. It had never been more than
preliminary, one may say, a pretext to me to explore inwardness
and unfamiliar mental states for whatever they might reveal. But
LSD has nothing more to give me. And I am therefore determined to
return to the world, and in time, to integrate myself with it. In
relation to any religious beliefs I now hold, I am a confessed
Franciscan, though I freely admit that I have a very long way to
go before I shall be able to express this outwardly&#151;with my
entire being&#151;the love Saint Francis of Assisi showed was for
all living creatures, and in respect to love of this kind, I must
to this extent be regarded as clumsy. Yet in Saint Francis
evolved Love of the very highest order for his delicate and
feminine sensibility offered Love a unique possibility of
manifestation. And thus, in the light of this knowledge, I can no
longer take my psychedelic trips seriously. I know that many
readers, and by no means the worst among them, would disapprove
of such measures as taking LSD; one should be strong enough, they
say, to exist by faith without the aid of drugs. Yes! One should
be, but what if one is too weak? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the impulse which now drives me back into the
world is precisely the same as that which drives so many into
monasteries or to keep the offices of prayer&#151;the desire for
self-realisation. <br>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
IN THE WESTERN WORLD, THEN, BY THE 1970s, THERE COULD NO longer
be any doubt that the attempt to control drugs through the crimino-legal
system had failed; and though there was great reluctance to admit
as much, there was more of an inclination to explore alternative
possibilities. And science was at last beginning to help, by beginning
to investigate the social effects of drugs. 
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>d'Abernon: the effects of alcohol</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The first tentative exploration of this territory was made in
the First World War, when the d'Abernon Committee was set up to
advise the Government on the effects of drink on the war effort.
Drink taken during the day, Lloyd George believed, made workers
slower and clumsier; and drink taken in the evening was apt to
cause absenteeism 'the morning after'. To what extent, the d'Abernon
Committee were asked to estimate, was the war effort thereby disrupted?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In their report, the Committee had to admit defeat. It was not
merely that scientists had not provided them with the answers;
scientists had not even asked the relevant questions. They had
conducted a great deal of research into alcohol in the laboratory,
but none into alcohol in the pub, the factory, or the home. Did
the drunkenness caused by beer or wine differ from that caused
by spirits? Did mixing drinks tend to produce drunkenness? How
far did the dilution of a drink&#151;whiskey with soda, say&#151;modify
its action? What was the effect of taking food in conjunction
with alcohol? Did fatigue alter the effect of alcohol on performance
of skilled movements? Was alcohol more injurious in dry than in
moist climates? To what extent was alcoholism caused by physiological
disturbances? And did the psychological effects of alcohol&#151;cheerfulness
for example&#151;improve resistance to adverse physical circumstances
such as cold? None of these questions had been put.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Nor, the report continued, had there been research into an aspect
of drug-taking about which a misconception was firmly rooted in
the public mind. It was widely assumed that alcohol, like other
drugs, caused addiction. Yet the great majority of drinkers did
not become addicts. There must, presumably, be something in an
individual which predisposed him to addiction; but what? Again,
the scientists had evaded the question. As a result there was
'an almost entire absence of reliable data regarding the psychology
of the drunkard, though adequate information on this point is
obviously essential in devising rational methods of treatment
of the inebriate. Little is known of the progress of the drinker
from occasional excess to chronic alcoholism. Are the occasional
drinker and the habitual drunkard two distinct types, or is the
former an early stage of the latter?'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The reason scientists had neglected applied research, the Committee
suggested, was partly that they were reluctant to involve themselves
in social, as distinct from academic, issues (sociology was not
yet accepted as an academic discipline); and partly that they
did not care to venture into unexplored territory&#151;the choice
of subjects for investigation had 'often been determined by the
ease with which they could be put to the test, or by their bearing
on some theoretical controversy, rather than their intrinsic and
practical importance'. This was a shrewd criticism; and the guidelines
which the Committee offered for the future were also sensible&#151;that
researchers should now begin to concentrate on finding out why
people took drugs, and what effects the drugs had on the people
who took them and on the community in general. But the Committee
suffered from a limitation. Although it lacked the necessary evidence,
there were some assumptions which, it felt, could safely be made.
Most of them were little more than pious aspirations: 'the ordinary
use of alcohol', its report advised, 'should not only be moderate,
but should also be limited to the consumption of beverages of
adequate dilution, taken at sufficient intervals of time to prevent
a deleterious action on the tissues'. But one assertion, 'that
alcohol is narcotic rather than stimulant in action', revealed
that the Committee shared the orthodox view of the time that it
was possible to categorise drugs as either narcotics or stimulants.
And it based its classification not on everyday experience, but
on research into the effects of alcohol on the body and the nervous
system. Asked to examine alcohol's social effects, the Committee
had castigated scientists for their reluctance to venture out
of the laboratory. Yet its own diagnosis was derived from the
lab, rather than the pub.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Louis Lewin: <I>Phantastica</I> </H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The most influential pharmacologist of the time, Louis Lewin,
suffered from the same limitation. He was anxious to show that
drugs had been one of the most important of man's discoveries,
and could be one of the most valuable of man's allies, and he
did his best to popularise mescaline&#151;without success, though
experiments by Rouhier in France and Beringer in Germany bore
out his claims. In his <I>Phantastica</I>, published in 1924,
he set out his creed.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If human consciousness is the most wonderful thing on earth, the
attempt to fathom the depths of the psychological action of narcotic
and stimulating drugs makes this wonder seem greater still, for
with their help man is enabled to transfer the emotions of everyday
life, as well as his will and intellect, to unknown regions; he
is enabled to attain degrees of emotional intensity and duration
which are otherwise unknown . . . By the exercise of their powers
on the brain, they release marvellous stores of latent energy.
They relieve the mentally tortured, massage the racking pains
of the sick, inspire with hope those doomed to death, endow the
overworked with new vitality and vigour such as no strength of
will could attain, and replace for an hour the exhaustion and
languor of the overworked by mental comfort and content. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Lewin was also well aware of the prevailing weakness of pharmacology;
and he mocked those whose contribution had been simply to produce
impressive-sounding terminology. 'Even today,' he wrote, 'we frequently
meet with interpretations of the action of medicinal and poisonous
substances which are merely pseudoscientific descriptions of their
effects.' They reminded him of the scene in Moliere's <I>Malade
Imaginaire</I> when the examination candidate, asked the reason
for opium's soporific action, replies 'because it is endowed with
narcotic and soporific properties'&#151;which so delights his examiners
that they immediately pass him. But Lewin then proceeded to follow
the same course himself. He had not received the formal academic
recognition which his abilities as a researcher and a teacher
merited&#151;perhaps because he was a Jew, and not given to disguising
his contempt for those rash enough to disagree with him. The easiest
way in which he could obtain it, in his own time, was to provide
the classification of drugs according to their pharmacological
properties which had eluded earlier researchers. He decided that
there were five categories:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1 <I>Euphorica</I>&#151;'sedatives of mental activity, these substances
diminish or even suspend the functions of emotion and perception'.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2 <I>Phantastica</I>&#151;hallucinating substances.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3 <I>Inebriantia</I>&#151;causing cerebral excitation followed by
depression.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
4 <I>Hypnotica</I>&#151;sleep producing agents.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
5 <I>Excitantia</I>&#151;mental stimulants.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The trouble began when Lewin tried to squeeze all known drugs
into the separate categories. His <I>Euphorica</I> were opium
and its derivatives, and cocaine. Indian Hemp, however, was classified
with the <I>Phantastica,</I> along with peyote the fly agaric,
henbane, datura and caapi. In the <I>Inebriantia</I> section,
alcohol was accompanied by chloroform, ether and benzine. The
<I>Hypnotica</I> included chloral, veronal, paraldehyde, potassium
bromide and&#151;remarkably, in view of the results of his own research
into it&#151;kava. And the <I>Excitantia</I> had to provide room
for all the rest&#151;a weird miscellany; including camphor, betel,
kat, coffee, tea, kola, mate, coca, tobacco, arsenic, and mercury.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Lewin was not unaware of the inconsistencies, which he did his
best to iron out by tortuous rationalizations. Some <I>Hypnotica,</I>
he admitted, were capable of being <I>Excitantia;</I> the reason
was that 'like all toxins, they act on the brain', producing a
euphoric state. The fact that the American Indians used tobacco
not as <I>Excitantia,</I> but as <I>Phantastica,</I> to produce
visions, proved more troublesome to explain. The best he could
do was suggest that the hallucinatory effects must have been due
to the carbon monoxide which they inhaled, together with the tobacco
fumes, whenever they lit their pipes. 
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The book had other limitations. Well-versed though he was in the
pharmacological literature, Lewin's reading outside it was less
than comprehensive; he quoted Surgeon Crombie's statistics about
the insanity caused by hemp drugs, unaware that they had been
demolished in the report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission.
But this was of little importance compared with the decision to
try to classify drugs according to their effects. Not that his
categories were accepted; but they gave rise to further futile
attempts along the same lines. The basic premise remained, that
it <I>ought</I> to be possible to think in terms of the chemical
action of a drug, rather than of the reaction of the people who
take it; leading to such pontifications as the argument that the
St. Bernard dogs who found lost travellers in the snow ought not
to have carried brandy in their little barrels, because brandy
is a depressant.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Largely as a result of this fixation, pharmacologists could not
come to grips with the most serious problem which drugs presented:
addiction. They could not even accept the traditional premise,
that addiction represented a failure of will power, because will
power was not quantifiable. A favourite proposition in the 1920s,
as Evelyn Waugh recalled in <I>Brideshead Revisited,</I> was 'it's
something chemical in him'; applied to alcoholics, it became 'the
cant phrase of the time, derived from heaven knows what misapplication
of popular science'. The available research funds were channelled
into the search for metabolic disfunction, or defects in the endocrine
system. And although by the 1930s there was more of a disposition
to admit the explanation might be psychological, research in that
area continued to be hampered by lack of resources, and by the
divisions among the psychologists themselves. The Freudians looked
for the causes of addiction in unconscious conflicts; the Pavlovians
preferred to regard it as another conditioned reflex&#151;similar
to that which B. F. Skinner induced in rats, so that when they
experienced the joy of a certain type of electric shock, they
would return to it again and again, sacrificing food, fighting
and sex for the chosen form of stimulation.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Auto-suggestion</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The break-through to a better understanding of the effect of drugs
can be traced to an experiment undertaken in 1933&#151;though it
was to be many years before its significance was appreciated.
In the <I>Quarterly Journal of Medicine</I> in 1933 two London
cardiologists, William Evans and C. Hoyle, described how they
had given out pills which their patients, suffering from angina,
assumed were pain-killing, but which were actually made from bicarbonate
of soda. Over a third of the patients reported that their pain
had been satisfactorily relieved.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It had long been known that people could be fooled by the fairground
quack's coloured water, and come back for more. But it had been
taken for granted they must be gullible souls, who only imagined
they were better, or who perhaps had only imagined they were ill.
This could hardly account for so high a proportion of angina patients
reacting to a placebo, as if it had been the real thing. And by
this time, there was a widely-publicised alternative explanation.
From his experience as a chemist in Troyes, Emile Coue had become
convinced that what cured many of his customers was not his medicines,
but their belief in them; a conviction which he was able to test
by giving them placeboes.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
At the time, Evans and Hoyle's paper aroused only mild curiosity;
and Coue's fame, though world-wide, turned out to be transitory.
The imagination could be stimulated, he had suggested, with the
aid of a simple formula; 'every day, in every way, I get better
and better'. It was a reversion to ritual; and in a ritual-starved
civilisation it caught on, throughout Europe and America, as well
as in France, with people intoning it in the bath or on the bus.
But his basic proposition, that the formula's function was simply
to help bring the imagination into play&#151;just as a drug might&#151;was
not grasped. It was assumed that he was calling for an exercise
of the will. The ritual became a music-hall joke and, like many
another craze of the twenties, Coueism soon became only a mildly
absurd memory.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
After the Second World War, however, research began at last to
broaden its base. The psychologists did not compose their differences,
but they managed to establish a measure of common ground, leading
to acceptance of the proposition that there are addiction-prone
individuals&#151;or, rather, that some people are more addiction-prone
than others, and are therefore more likely to become addicts if
nudged in that direction by any of a variety of forces.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
At first sight this was not far removed from the earlier idea
that addicts lacked will power. But there was one essential difference.
It had been believed that the addict could extricate himself if
he really wanted to, by an effort of will. The new theory came
closer to regarding addiction as a neurosis. There was no point
in telling an addict to pull himself together, because the fact
he had become an addict itself revealed that he was incapable
of such self-discipline.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The reasons why one individual was more addiction-prone than his
neighbour proved difficult to pin down. It was easy enough to
show with the help of statistics that the Italians, in proportion
to the amount of wine they drank, were far less likely to become
alcoholics than the French; not so easy to determine why. Long-term
monitoring projects began to turn up clues; they revealed, for
example, that alcoholics were more likely to come from homes where
there had been parental conflict. But there were scores of similar
environmental possibilities to be considered, as well as interactions
between them. All that could be claimed with assurance was that&#151;as
Howard Jones put it, in his study of alcoholism&#151;addiction was
not 'the invariable result of particular kinds of personality
constellation', but 'the solution found when problems of adjustment
arise because certain types of personality are confronted by certain
types of environmental stress'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This research therefore, though it contributed to a better understanding
of the drug problem, did little to assist either prevention or
cure. For a time it was hoped that new institutions, specialising
in the treatment of drug addicts, would be the answer. Even hardliners
like Anslinger approved, because they wanted it to be demonstrated
that addicts could learn, or be taught, self-control. The first
such establishment was opened in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1935,
subjecting heroin addicts to a rigorous course designed to dry
them out and refit them for society; and by 1953, Anslinger was
able to boast that of the 18,000 patients who had been through
it, two-thirds had not returned. This should, he felt, give everyone
confidence that the system worked. That confidence was soon shattered.
Follow-up studies of those two-thirds, to find how they were faring,
revealed that the great majority had relapsed. Lexington s success
rate, it was estimated, was only around three per cent. Other
institutions, more sympathetic in their approach, were to do a
little better; but not much. As Brecher sadly noted in his <I>Licit
and Illicit Drugs,</I> 'no effective cure for heroin addiction
has been found'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
One reason for the failure of institutional treatment emerged
when a few doctors began to study placebo effect in its own right.
They found that the pharmacological content of a drug was not
necessarily the determining factor in the patient's reaction to
it For example, when Dr. Stewart Wolf&#151;one of the pioneers of
such studies in America&#151;gave a woman an emetic, telling her
it was a medicine designed to stop her feeling sick, not merely
did she stop feeling sick, but her stomach juices, which were
being monitored reacted as if they were dealing with an anti-emetic&#151;in
other words, to her mental picture of what the drug's effects
should be, rather than to the drug.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In his <I>Drugs and Human Relations,</I> published in 1970, Dr.
Gordon Claridge set out the evidence which had been accumulating
to show the extent to which it is not the drug, but the expectation
of the drug taker, which determines reactions. In a trial where
one group took barbiturates, while a matched group were given
placeboes, the barbiturates proved to be more effective sedatives
only when the members of the group which was taking them were
expecting sedation. Where they did not know what to expect from
the pills, the reaction was the same whether they took the placebo
or the drug. An experiment which Claridge himself undertook on
behalf of the British army in 1961, to find out how the tranquilliser
meprobamate affected soldiers' reactions, had a similar result.
Although there was no significant difference between the reactions
of those who took the drug, and those who took the placebo, both
performed their set laboratory tasks less well than a third group
who had not been given pills at all. The fact of taking pills,
in other words, led to a deterioration in performance 'Although
none of the subjects was told what to expect'; Claridge observed,
'most of them clearly associated drug taking with &quot;being
drugged&quot;, or being made less efficient in some way'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
 It was not simply the lay public who could be deceived by placeboes.
Doctors had been inclined to think they would not be good subjects
in such tests, because they would know from training and experience
how to recognise a drug's effects. But when in the late 1960s
the members of the staff of the Department of Psychological Medicine
in Glasgow University who had volunteered for tests were given
pills which might be either amphetamines or placeboes, and were
invited to guess which they had taken, their replies were scarcely
more accurate than if they had decided by spinning a coin. One
psychiatrist of several years' standing recognised his symptoms
as coming from dexamphetamine. According to Claridge, 'during
the next few hours he became more &quot;high&quot;, and the following
morning announced that participation in the experiment had considerably
enhanced his enjoyment of a party the previous evening'. It had
then to be broken to him that he had taken a placebo. Other members
of the staff, equally convinced that they had taken placeboes,
found that they had in fact taken amphetamines.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>In search of reality</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
At first sight, such evidence may seem hard to reconcile with
the accounts of the effects of the vision-inducing drugs. It is
conceivable that Huxley knew enough about mescaline, when he took
it, for his imagination to take over; but not that Hofmann could
have known what was going to happen when he took LSD. Another
experiment described by Claridge provides a clue. In it, one of
the subjects who thought he had taken LSD described what he saw:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . a lot of strange shapes and brilliant colour, after images,
as if I looked through pebble finished glass, particularly this
morning. Especially this morning colours were more brilliant than
I have ever experienced. Voices were at times somewhat in the
distance, along with a feeling of being in a real situation, a
dream kind of state, time is distorted, goes rather slowly, and
an hour is only 10 to 15 minutes when I look at my watch . . .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
'A perfect description of the LSD state!', Claridge commented&#151;but
the subject had in fact had a placebo. The mind, in other words,
is capable of duplicating any drug experience; but this is not
the same as saying that the drug is irrelevant. LSD is obviously
a highly potent substance, capable of inducing striking changes
in perception. What it cannot do is produce more than is already
within the mind's own capability. The drug is essentially the
trigger mechanism. That is why at different times, or in different
cultures, reactions to the same drug have been so very different.
Take, for instance the passage
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Shivering I rose from my seat, incapable of rest, when that heavenly
and harp-like voice sang its own victorious welcome . . . a chorus
of elaborate harmony displayed before me as in a piece of arras-work,
the whole of my past life&#151;not as if recalled by an act of memory
but as if present and incarnated in the music; no longer painful
to dwell upon, but the details of its incidents removed, or blended
in some hazy abstraction, and its passion exalted, spiritualized,
and sublimed
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This, too, might have been written about an LSD 'trip'; it is
in fact, de Quincey's description of the effects of laudanum.
Jean Cocteau reacted similarly to opium. All of us, he claimed,
carry something folded up within us like those Japanese flowers
made of wood which unfold in water
<BLOCKQUOTE>
opium plays the same role as the water. None of us carries the
same kind of flower. It is possible that a person who does not
smoke may never know the kind of flower that opium might have
unfolded within him.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
On other writers, however, the opiates have had the opposite effect.
For William Burroughs, they diminished awareness so that they
could only, he felt, be a hindrance to the artist; whereas cannabis
gave him what he needed: 'unquestionably this drug is very useful
to the artist, activating trains of association that would otherwise
be inaccessible'. Others, again, have derived their inspiration
from tobacco, about whose effects J. M. Barrie wrote in terms
ordinarily applied only to a loved one.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
 An attempt to account for these variations was made by William
James in his <I>Varieties of Religious Experience,</I> where he
recalled the effect ether had had on him. He had found no reason,
he wrote, to change the impression he had formed at the time.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It is that our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness
as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst
all about it, parted from it by the flimsiest of screens, there
lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different. We may
go through life without suspecting their existence; but apply
the requisite stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their
completeness . . . How to regard them is the question&#151;for they
are so discontinuous with ordinary consciousness. Yet they may
determine attitudes though they cannot furnish formulas, and open
a region though they fail to give a map. At any rate, they forbid
a premature closing of our accounts with reality.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The function of the drug is to provide the stimulus: and any drug
may serve, if it happens to suit the individual concerned. Ether
had suited James; peyotl had made him sick&#151;perhaps because he
literally could not stomach it, perhaps because the circumstances
in which he took it had been unfavourable.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But how does a drug, any drug, liberate the mind? Huxley believed
the explanation must be sought in a theory advanced by Henri Bergson,
and later elaborated by the Cambridge philosopher, Professor C.
D. Broad. The original function of the brain, Broad thought, was
basically not productive, but eliminative. It was designed 'to
protect us from being overwhelmed and confused by the mass of
largely useless and irrelevant knowledge, by shutting out most
of what we should otherwise perceive or remember at any moment,
and leaving only that very small and special selection which is
likely to be practically useful'. This, Huxley decided, would
explain what had happened to him, and to others who had had similar
drug experiences. Ordinarily we get only a 'measly trickle' from
the mind's vast resources. But a few individuals have a by-pass
mechanism, enabling them to open the doors of perception; others
construct one with the help of spiritual exercises; and others
can utilise drugs.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
On this hypothesis, the vision-inducing drug could be described
as a password to open doors which, for most people, are ordinarily
closed. There is no single password; each individual may have
his own&#151;or none. Only one drug in common use has rarely been
employed for the purpose: alcohol. Alcohol and the hallucinogens,
Humphrey Osmond has argued, are actually antithetical; alcohol
<BLOCKQUOTE>
produces a downward transcendence, peyotl an upward one&#151;the
difference between levelling up and levelling down. Alcohol allows
one to relate to others by being more sure of one's self. This,
in small doses, is much better than not being able to relate at
all, but it is a very precarious business, and selfishness may
soon end in brawling and ill-temper. Peyotl acts not by emphasising
one's own self but by expanding it into the selves of others,
with a deepening empathy or in-feeling. The self is dissolved,
and, in being dissolved, enriched . . .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Anthropological field workers, too, have reported that the shaman
who takes a drink loses his powers of divination. It remains possible,
therefore, that the pharmacological action of alcohol will eventually
be shown to be qualitatively different from that of other drugs,
so that the doors which it opens do not expand awareness but instead&#151;as
Malcolm Lowry suggested in <I>Under the Volcano</I>&#151;facilitate
the emergence of a second self, ordinarily kept hidden.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Even this, though, is uncertain. Alcohol may have the effects
it does because in some as yet unexplained way our minds are programmed
to react to it&#151;as a shaman's is programmed to react to tobacco
as a vision-inducer.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The most likely hypothesis is that although a measured quantity
of a specific drug can, other things being equal, have statistically
predictable effects within a culture, its effects can vary greatly
with different cultures, as well as with different individuals,
or with the same individual at different times&#151;as Oliver Sacks'
experiences treating patients with 'L Dopa', described in his
<I>Awakenings</I> so strikingly illustrated. The reactions to
the drug, he found appeared to be dictated not just by the personalities
of the patients, but by fragmented elements of those personalities,
too.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In ordinary circumstances, however, expectation is the most potent
force in determining a drug's effects. When Dr. Walter Pahnke
tested a psilocybin mushroom derivative on theology students at
Harvard, he found that the visions the students reported were
indistinguishable from the visions they would have expected to
get from a mystical experience. And from his study of the peyotl
cult among the Huichol Indians of Mexico, Peter Furst concluded
that beyond any sensations which could be attributed to the chemistry
of the plant, 'there are powerful cultural factors at work that
influence, if they do not actually determine, both content and
interpretation of the drug experience'.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Drugs and drink</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Scientists, then, have at last begun to ask relevant questions
about drugs, and are beginning to get some answers. But the answers
have been largely ignored, or rejected, because they do not fit
in with society's preconceptions about drugs. One of the commonest
assumptions, for example, is that alcohol has in some measure
been tamed, and consequently can safely be put in a different
category from other drugs. But a research project undertaken by
Dr. Harris Isbell and his associates at Lexington has revealed
that almost all the reactions of subjects who were given barbiturates
in the experiment, from mild tipsiness to delirium tremens, duplicated
those of alcohol&#151;so closely, Brecher thought, that 'the barbiturates
might be labelled a &quot;solid alcohol&quot; and alcohol classed
as a &quot;liquid barbiturate&quot;.' The differences between
them were chiefly the consequence of the barbiturates being available
in more concentrated form. Otherwise, the evidence suggested,
there was no logical reason why the barbiturates and alcohol should
not be placed on the same legal footing. Yet in practice, as Brecher
put it,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
society takes a very different stance with respect to the twin
drugs. Alcohol is treated as a non-drug; it is on sale in multidose
bottles at 40,000 liquor stores and in countless other outlets
as well; it is freely sold to those 'of age' in saloons, taverns,
cocktail lounges, nightclubs, roadhouses, and even ordinary family
restaurants; and more than $250 m a year is spent on advertising
alcohol. The barbiturates, by contrast, are legally saleable only
on prescription in pharmacies; other sales are severely punishable
criminal offenses.. It is a curious fact, indeed that Americans
today are bombarded with advertising urging them to buy a liquid
that, if secured without a prescription in tablet or capsule form,
could lead to imprisonment for both seller and buyer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In clinical terms, Isbell's experiments have also showed that
the effects of alcohol and the barbiturates on health are more
serious than those of the opiates. If its social side effects
are taken into consideration, alcoholism emerges as by far the
most serious of the Western World's drug problems. According to
an estimate published early in 1972 by the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in America, nearly ten per cent
of the nation's drinkers at that time were alcoholics, doing incalculable
damage to their health, wrecking their families' lives, costing
$15 billion annually in damage to property, loss of working time,
and welfare payments, and causing havoc on the roads. In the same
year, Lord Rosenheim, Chairman of the Medical Council on Alcoholism
in Britain, warned that the number of alcoholics was much higher
than doctors realised&#151;there were 350,000 in Britain, he estimated
but there might be as many as half a million&#151;and that alcohol
caused far more actual illness, as well as misery, than all the
other drugs such as cannabis, heroin and LSD put together.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In both countries, too, the number of alcoholics has been rising&#151;so
rapidly, in Britain an international conference on the subject
in London was told in 1973, that they would top the million mark
by 1980. Many other countries in different parts of the world
have reported the same trend. Zambia, Kenneth Kaunda complained
that winter, was becoming a nation of drunkards; and he threatened
to resign if they did not learn to control their excessive drinking
habits. Yet the World Health Organisation, faced with such reports
from all over the world, could do little more than file them.
'So far as I am concerned', Dr. Dale Cameron, head of WHO's Drug
Dependency Unit, said in 1971, 'alcohol is probably the king of
the mountain,' but so far as the U.N. was concerned the king could
do no wrong, because by tacit consent alcohol had not been included
in drug conventions. In logic, or sense, such an omission was
impossible to justify&#151;as the Shafer Committee recognised. American
laws, its report noted, had made alcohol the preferred social
drug, but 'that historical fact should not prevent further evaluation
of this preference'. On the Committee's own evaluation, alcohol
dependence was 'without question the most serious drug problem
in this country today'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This is not, of course, to suggest that a campaign to wean people
away from alcohol could blithely stress the relative safety of,
say, cannabis as an alternative. Indeed the latest reports on
cannabis, published by the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Internal
Security, strongly suggest that the drug carries greater dangers,
mental and physical, than has earlier been recognised. This discovery
appears to be partly due to more, and more sophisticated, research
projects; partly to the recent development of stronger, more dangerous
forms of the drug; partly to some as yet unexplained psychological
reaction among users (perhaps more people are taking it not for
a 'lift', but as a narcotic).
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The evidence provides a salutary reminder that any drug, and all
drugs, can have adverse effects. To judge from the introduction
to the published volume of evidence, by Senator James Eastland,
though, the lesson that banning a drug is the certain way massively
to increase the sales of it has not been learned. He is aware
that ten times as much cannabis gets into the country as is seized
('a fairly conservative estimate'). He is also aware that in the
past five years seizures of marihuana have increased tenfold,
and of hashish, twenty-five-fold. But it still has not got through
to him why. Dr. Henry Smith Williams's 1938 prophecy has come
true; prohibition of cannabis has brought a five billion dollar
racket in its train.

<h1>A Plea for Sanity ...<br>
</h1>

<p><b> Michael Booth 1996</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>The thirty years or so since illicit drug use emerged as a
modern social phenomenon have been marked by inquiry after
inquiry and report after report. Every one of these inquiries and
reports has come to basically the same conclusion, that our
current policy of prohibiting some drugs is not working, and,
more to the point, that it cannot work. This week still more
Australian politicians are about to consider another proposal
that has the potential to start us down a path that might well be
able to circumvent the considerable costs that our current drugs
policies have burdened us with. </p>

<p>The Ministerial Council on Drug Strategies, which is made up
of Health and Police Ministers from every Parliament in Australia
will meet later this week in Hobart in order to consider a
proposal put by the ACT government after four years of detailed
research, a proposal for a trial with the aim of investigating
the controlled supply of heroin as a treatment for dependent
heroin users. </p>

<p>This latest excursion by governments into the field of drug
policy reform comes just after the failure of the Victorian
Premier's Drug Advisory Council, or the Pennington Report, which
recommended wholesale changes to marijuana laws. In fact the bulk
of Pennington's report, which was drafted without any police
serving on the Advisory Council, was fairly innocuous. The report
made eight general and some seventy two specific recommendations
that address: sustained local and statewide action; law
enforcement; legislative change; support and treatment; and
information and education. Most of these recommendations were
uncontroversial motherhood type statements which did not attract
much comment at all, let alone any criticism. </p>

<p>The conservative thinkers and anti-drug warriors who are
standing in the way of meaningful reform of drugs policy must
have had apoplexy when they read recommendation 7 of the
Pennington Report. This particular recommendation called on the
Victorian government to amend the 1981 Drugs Poisons and
Controlled Substances Act must have given the anti-drug warriors
apoplexy. The twelve specific recommendations that detail the
amendments to the Controlled Substances Act calls for the use and
possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana to no longer be an
offence, the cultivation of up to five plants per household no
longer be an offence, the trafficking of marijuana to an adult be
dealt with by a caution, while trafficking to a minor continues
to be subject to heavy penalties. Local governments be given the
power to regulate offensive behaviour under the influence of
marijuana under the Summary Offences Act 1966. All convictions
for possession and use of small amounts of marijuana to be
expunged. The initial penalty for the use and possession of small
quantities of hard drugs to be a police caution and referral to a
drug assessment and treatment service, with escalating penalties
for subsequent offences. Imprisonment should be used as a last
resort penalty for drug users. Drug trafficking offences should
remain on the books, and be augmented by new penalties against
driving under the influence of drugs. </p>

<p>Despite the all too public focus on marijuana, the Advisory
Council was originally established in the wake of a flood of
heroin onto the streets of Victoria, and a subsequent spate of
overdose deaths. The Advisory Council noted the connection
between marijuana and heroin - they are both illegal - and based
their recommendations on the desirability of removing the most
widely used illicit drug - marijuana - from the same channels of
distribution and supply that also bring one of the least widely
used, but nevertheless destructive drugs - heroin - to young
Australians. </p>

<p>Sadly the Pennington report fell on largely deaf ears. The
Victorian Police Commissioner weighed into the debate, saying
that to implement the findings of the Advisory Council report
would be to &quot;raise the white flag of surrender&quot; in the
war on drugs. Disparaging remarks about the thrust of the report,
and the general unwillingness of politicians to provide any
leadership on drugs policy saw Premier Kennett, despite his
reputation as a &quot;can-do&quot; leader who is not afraid to
tackle the hard questions, back pedal from his public commitment
to implement the findings of the report. </p>

<p>Now there are more politicians considering a different aspect
of reform to drug policy - the proposal to investigate the
usefulness of heroin in the treatment of opiate dependent drug
users. No laws have to be changed, no international treaties
repudiated. There is no proposal to make heroin freely available
through supermarkets. There is instead an extremely modest and
conservative proposition before the Ministers to commit
themselves to a research project. It says much for the politics
of drug policy reform that even the ACT heroin trial is likely to
be knocked back. </p>

<p>In the last few years heroin use has emerged from the hidden
depths of the sub-culture that it has inhabited since Keith
Richards and Lou Reed made it trendy and fashionable in the early
1970s. The last six months or so have seen articles about heroin
in publications like JUICE, Rolling Stone, the Sydney Morning
Herald, as well as more conservative magazines like Marie Claire
and Cosmopolitan, the latter with a lingerie clad model injecting
herself. The films Pulp Fiction and Trainspotting has put the
spotlight squarely on heroin use, and there is also the three
part documentary series currently being shown on ABC television,
Dealing With The Demon. </p>

<p>All of this public scrutiny of heroin has led some
commentators to argue that it is the attention paid to and the
coverage of heroin in popular culture that is responsible for the
upswing in heroin use. Given the essentially conservative nature
of our mass media it is much more likely that all the coverage of
heroin is a reflection of heroin use, and not a promotion of it.
Regardless, Australia is indeed experiencing something of a surge
in the use of heroin, and there is thus increased pressure on
many parties to do something about it. </p>

<p>For most in society, &quot;doing something about the drug
problem&quot; has meant increased penalties for use and
trafficking, as well as associated legislation that can
confiscate any assets from accused drug dealers, the reporting of
cash transactions, increased police powers of surveillance and
detention, and so forth. Indeed, the Royal Commission into the
NSW Police Service has heard evidence from one disgraced police
officer after another that it was their ineffectiveness at
keeping drugs off the streets that led them to set themselves up
as judge, jury, and executioner, and plant drugs on suspects,
forge and falsify confessions, and finally, go into business
themselves on the grounds that someone was always going to sell
drugs, and it might as well be them. </p>

<p>The report of the Victorian Premiers Drug Advisory Council is
not without flaws. It has a somewhat mechanical view of drugs and
drug use that overlooks the fact that drugs are first and
foremost a phenomenon of culture and lifestyle, and that drug
taking behaviour is learned behaviour. Despite its defects,
however, the report does implicitly recognise the futility of
trying to control drugs by placing an outright ban on them,
arguing instead that in order to alter the impact of drugs on
society we have to alter the circumstances in which people are
introduced to drugs, and the circumstances in which people
purchase and consume drugs. </p>

<p>The vote later this week on the ACT heroin trial, as was the
case with the Pennington Report, has given a number of
opportunities to address much of the harm done by drugs in
society, the more so given that all that the politicians
concerned have to do is to concur with the admittedly difficult
decisions and recommendations that have resulted from the
independent and scholarly inquiries that have examined drugs
policies. Those arguing for drugs policy reform will probably be
disappointed, though, as these latest carefully researched and
thought out recommendations finish up following the findings and
recommendations of every other major inquiry into drug policies,
findings and recommendations which have also recognised the sheer
impossibility of using a policy of prohibition to minimise the
damage done to our society by the use of drugs. </p>

<p>Herein lies the real tragedy. The politics of drug law reform
will ensure the triumph of the irrational and illogical views of
those like the Victorian Police Commissioner, who argued that
proposed new laws that permitted households to grow five
marijuana plants for personal consumption were simply
unenforceable. The irony lies with the inability of the
Commissioner to see that current drug laws that totally prohibit
the growing, possession and use of marijuana are similarly
unenforceable. </p>

<p>The anti-drug warriors who are manning the barricades to
protect society against the flow of illicit drugs are somewhat
like the French generals who placed their faith in the Maginot
Line to stop the German army. While the police and other social
conservatives are trying to argue that reforming the laws will
open up Australia to illicit drugs they are overlooking the fact
that, like the Maginot Line, their own line in the &quot;war on
drugs&quot; has been breached in so many places as to be
practically and symbolically useless. Drugs are widespread in
society. There is no way that law reform can possibly make drugs
any more widespread than they currently are now. </p>

<p>Those opposing drug law reform might argue that changing the
laws will send the &quot;wrong message to society, but they must
also stop and consider what sort of message is sent to society by
the blind and stubborn refusal to even examine the evidence on
drug use, and to consider alternatives to a set of policies that
have manifestly failed, and must manifestly fail, in achieving
their aims and objectives. </p>

<p>No better argument against law enforcement can be imagined
than to consider what might happen if the forces of prohibition
and law enforcement were to become stunningly successful. Imagine
that every drug dealer and drug user in Australia were to come
forward and line up outside Police Headquarters one morning, each
with a bag of dope in one hand and a signed confession in the
other. It sounds like a law enforcement officer's dream come
true, they wouldn't even have to go to all the trouble of
tracking down the drug users and dealers, all they would have to
do would be to process the self confessed offenders, and punish
them according to the law. Drug problem solved. </p>

<p>In fact such a scenario is the stuff of nightmares for
Australian Police Forces. During 1995 nearly forty per cent of
all Australian males admitted to having used illicit drugs, as
did nearly thirty per cent of females. State and Commonwealth
legal systems would collapse under the weight of a strategy that
actually detected and prosecuted all the millions of those
Australians, most of whom must be otherwise law abiding and tax
paying citizens. Assuming that the those arguing against drug
policy reform are not asking Australians to write a blank cheque
to detect and prosecute drug offences, they should be able to say
to what extent the law can, and should be enforceable. Even a
cursory examination of the figures will show that the laws
against drugs are not, and can never be enforceable. Even if the
Victorian Police Commissioner wanted to argue that the police
concentrate on those drugs that are demonstrably more dangerous
than marijuana, drugs like amphetamines, heroin, cocaine, and
ecstasy, he will still have to acknowledge that the policy he is
supporting is trying to regulate the behaviour of an enormous
number of Victorians, a number that would overwhelm his police
force and the court system should his preferred strategy of law
enforcement actually be successful. </p>

<p>Our current drug laws and policies are the result of a
mish-mash of historical accident, racial prejudice, international
geopolitics, outdated morals, misleading ideas about medicine and
health, and the natural conservatism of Australian society and
the politicians who have resolutely refused to display any
leadership. It might be argued that our current laws and
policies, given their origins, are just too hard to change. It
might also be argued that it doesn't matter much anyway. Those
who want drugs can get them, and the rest of us can hide behind
the ineffectual remnants of the Maginot Line in the war on drugs,
secure in the knowledge that we are not sending the &quot;wrong
message&quot;, whatever that may be. </p>

<p>It does matter, though. Hundreds of young Australians are
suffering and dying as a result of these laws, laws that cannot
prevent a flood of impure heroin that is leading to increased
numbers of overdoses, and increased levels of hepatitis through
needle sharing, laws that make marijuana the most profitable cash
crop in the country and ensure that the profits go to criminal
figures and corrupt cops, laws that ensure that some of the
people who use a particular drug are punished and marginalised,
while other users get off scot free, and users of other drugs
altogether are given the protection of the law and the assistance
of society. Isn't it time for a change. John Howard climbed on
top of thirty five dead Australians to introduce a politically
difficult decision to ban semi-automatic weapons. Surely it isn't
asking too much of him to listen to the experts, and climb on top
of the thousands and thousands casualties of the drug laws to
argue for another politically difficult decision? </p>

<h1>BLACK JUDGES SPEAK OUT ON RACISM </h1>

<p><b>New Book Exposes Flaws in Justice System</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Book Review</b> </p>

<p>Black judges criticize America's most popular anti-crime
policies as racist and proven failures during candid interviews
about the nation's system in the new book &quot;Black Judges on </p>

<p>Justice.&quot; </p>

<p>Mandatory sentencing is very popular with politicians who
posture themselves as &quot;tough on crime,&quot; but these harsh
imprisonment polices have &quot;not been effective in cutting
crime,&quot; states Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Veronica S.
McBeth. McBeth is one of three female jurists included in the 14
judges interviewed in this book that has been described by one
reviewer as a &quot;seminal work.&quot; </p>

<p>The incarceration of huge numbers of young black males
nationwide, resulting largely from mandatory sentencing laws, is
termed &quot;a quiet kind of genocide&quot; by Joseph Brown of
Memphis, a trial court judge who trims his black judicial robes
in African kente cloth. </p>

<p>&quot;Black Judges on Justice&quot; is the first book to
present the views of leading African-American jurists serving on
the nation's federal and state benches. The black jurists
interviewed include: </p>

<p>Famed federal jurist A. Leon Higginbotham, who authored the
famous letter attacking the anti-black attitudes of now U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas; Bruce Wright, the feisty
New York City jurist who has won acclaim for his decades long
fight against racism in the judiciary, and Constance Baker
Motley, the first African-American female federal judge. </p>

<p>The jurists forthrightly discuss the inequities of race and
class which too often stack the deck of the justice system
against blacks. For example, the subtle but pervasive prejudices
of judges and prosecutors, which impact on decisions like who
gets probation and who goes to prison, are examined by Theodore
A. McKee, a Philadelphia judge who now sits on the federal Third
Circuit Court of Appeals. </p>

<p>The jurists in &quot;Black Judges&quot; provide rare insights
into the judicial decision making process, exposing how this
life-impacting process is often arbitrary and wholly unrelated to
laws. Further, the jurists present intriguing autobiographical
sketches of their accomplishments, often in the face of
tremendous adversity. The jurists were interviewed by
Philadelphia journalist (and STRONG advocate for Mumia!) Linn
Washington, Jr., a graduate of the Yale Law Journalism Fellowship
program. &quot;Black Judges on Justice,&quot; published by the
New Press, exposes many myths. It is widely believed in this
society that Black leadership is soft on crime. But Washington,
D.C. judge Reggie B. Walton served as President Bush's Assistant
Drug Czar and Senior White House Advisor on Crime. Walton says
one of his major frustrations working for the Bush Administration
was his inability to convince administration officials of the
fact that fighting crime is ineffective without attacking social
causes of crime. </p>

<p>Abigail R. Rogers, a family court judge in South Carolina and
the first black female jurist in that state, reveals how she has
been victimized by racism and sexism from whites and blacks
alike. </p>

<p>The author of &quot;Black Judges on Justice,&quot; Linn
Washington, is an award-winning investigative reporter and
editorial writer. A graduate of Temple University who holds a
masters degree from the Yale Law School, Washington has spent
much of his 20-plus years in journalism specializing in issues
involving race and matters related to the justice system.
Washington is a former assistant to the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and former executive editor of
&quot;The Philadelphia Tribune.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Black Judges on Justice&quot; is receiving favorable
reviews. &quot;The Quarterly Black Review&quot; describes the
book as an &quot;illuminating work ... that should be required
reading for anyone interested in the relationship between blacks
and the law.&quot; The magazine &quot;Booklist&quot; describes
the book as &quot;well-written and insightful&quot; while
&quot;Publisher's Weekly&quot; termed the book
&quot;thoughtful.&quot; &quot;Black Judges on Justice&quot; is on
the recommended reading lists of &quot;Essence&quot; and
&quot;Emerge&quot; magazines. </p>

<p>Derrick Bell, the distinguished law professor and expert on
racism in American law, has stated, &quot;Beleaguered
racial-equality forces will applaud Linn Washington's searingly
candid interviews with these courageous men and women who strive
both to alleviate unfairness in their courtrooms and to urge
reforms that, if adopted, would move courts toward justice and
away from the cynicism, racism, and moral bankruptcy in which
they are now mired.&quot; </p>

<h1>Study: Teen Drug Use Rises </h1>

<p><b>Dec. 15, 1995 </b></p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) -- After declining for almost a decade,
teen-age drug use is on the rise in the 1990s. Among the possible
reasons: Many of today's parents tried illegal drugs themselves
and may feel awkward warning their children away from them. </p>

<p>An annual survey released Friday found that teen-age drug use
has risen steadily since 1992, raising fears that the dramatic
drop in drug use in the 1980s will eventually be wiped out. </p>

<p>Marijuana use among eighth-graders has nearly doubled since
1991, with 20 percent saying they have used it at least once.
That's up from 17 percent just one year earlier. </p>

<p>More than 48 percent of high school seniors in the class of
1995 had used some type of illegal drug at least once, up almost
3 percentage points from 1994. Seniors' drug use hit its lowest
level in the 21-year-old survey in 1992, when under 41 percent
said they had ever tried an illegal drug. Despite the upward
trend, today's high school students remain much less likely to
try illegal drugs than people who were in school during the 1970s
or 1980s, said a director of the ``Monitoring the Future'' study.
</p>

<p>In an era when so many parents -- including even President
Clinton -- have tried marijuana, some may feel awkward giving
their children strong anti-drug lectures, said Lloyd D. Johnston,
principal investigator for the University of Michigan study. Most
of them ``do not want their children involved in drugs, marijuana
or otherwise, but many have fallen silent on the issues because
they feel quite conflicted about it,'' Johnston said.
Nevertheless, he said, it's critical that these parents warn
their children of the hazards. </p>

<p>What should they say? Johnston said they can make several
points: When they were young, less was known about the dangers of
drugs. Many children and teens now begin using drugs at a younger
age, which carries more risks. And drugs widely available today
are stronger and more addictive. </p>

<p>Also, the threats of AIDS and violent crime make drug use and
drinking more dangerous, said Donna Shalala, secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services. </p>

<p>Another explanation for the increase, Johnston said, is a
decline in news coverage and public service advertisements to
educate teens about the dangers of drugs since the end of Nancy
Reagan's ``Just Say No'' campaign and President Bush's ``war on
drugs.'' Johnston also accused rock and rap songs of promoting
drug use. </p>

<p>Shalala called for ``a broad national effort,'' including
parents, teachers, coaches, clergy and the government, to teach
young people about the hazards of drugs. </p>

<p>``Or else,'' she said, ``in a few years, we're going to find
ourselves right back where we were in the old days, when children
and teen-agers viewed drug, alcohol and tobacco use as perfectly
normal and acceptable behavior.'' </p>

<p>She noted that more than 64 percent of high school seniors
said they had smoked a cigarette, up more than 2 percentage
points from the year before. </p>

<p>Both the Clinton administration and Republican congressional
leaders blamed the opposition's policies for making the problem
worse. </p>

<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
criticized the administration's ``ineffectual leadership and
failed federal policies.'' </p>

<p>Shalala blasted the Republicans for cutting spending on
federal drug treatment and prevention efforts and on a
school-based anti-drug program. </p>

<p>Drug use among teen-agers peaked around 1980, when about 65
percent of high school seniors said they had used an illegal
drug, Johnston said. </p>

<p>More than 50,000 students were surveyed last spring for the
21st annual national study. It has a margin of error of plus or
minus 2 percentage points. </p>

<p>Other findings: </p>

<p>--Nearly one in 20 high school seniors uses marijuana daily. </p>

<p>--Among eighth-graders, 21 percent said they had used an
illegal drug during the 12 months before the survey. </p>

<p>--The percentage of high school seniors who have tried LSD
increased from 6.9 percent last year to 8.4 percent. </p>

Abraham (R-Michigan) won a big victory over the drug pushers as
the Senate passed his bill which blocks new sentencing guidelines
lowering crack cocaine offenses. The Abraham Amendment passed by
unanimous consent late Friday evening. </p>

<p>&quot;Drug pushers all across America were cheering at the
Sentencing Commission's proposal to lower prison sentences for
crack offenses,&quot; Abraham said. &quot;As hard as it is to
believe, there are some policy makers in Washington who actually
want to lower prison sentences for drug pushers who target our
children. But tonight the Senate put an end to the drug dealers'
celebration, and our children and neighborhoods are a little
safer.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;This is no way to be waging the war on drugs, and the
Senate did the right thing by rejecting the proposal to lower
these drug sentences,&quot; Abraham said. &quot;The purpose of
the bill is simple: to block implementation of proposals by the
Sentencing Commission that would lower sentences for crack
dealers.&quot; </p>

<p>On May 1, the Sentencing Commission, an independent agency
appointed by the President, proposed changes to the Sentencing
Guidelines that would lower crack distribution sentences to
between 1/2 and 1/6 of their present length. This would mean that
some crack dealers who under current law would get substantial
sentences could end up serving no jail time at all. </p>

<p>&quot;I think this sends entirely the wrong message: that in
the war against crack, society blinked,&quot; Abraham said.
&quot;That is not what we should be telling the crack dealers.
And that is not what we should be telling the brave law abiding
members of communities under attack by the crack dealers who are
fighting back.&quot; </p>

<p>Abraham's bill will stop those Sentencing Commission proposals
which automatically go into effect on November 1 -- and make sure
that any other guidelines which lower drug sentences don't get
implemented. The House must now take up similar action to defeat
the guidelines. </p>

<p>The Sentencing Commission cited the reason for their proposal
was out of concern that because a majority of crack distributors
sentenced are African-Americans, the higher crack sentences
creates a perception of unfairness. The Commission based their
concern on the fact that sentences for powder cocaine sentences
are lower than crack sentences. </p>

<p>&quot;I agree with part of the Commission's concern, but the
answer is not to lower the crack sentences, but to toughen the
powder sentences,&quot; Abraham said. &quot;That is why I hope
Congress will act soon on the bill I've introduced to raise the
sentences for powder distribution by making the triggers for
mandatory minimums 100 grams for 5 years and 1000 grams for ten
years, rather than 500 and 5000 as they are now.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The Sentencing Commission's solution -- to address this
'unfairness' by lowering the crack sentences -- is a truly
terrible idea. It is not fair to the vast majority of people
living in communities, like Detroit, under attack by the crack
dealers and trying to defend them -- many of whom are
African-Americans. And I am sure it is the last thing in the
world that many of them would want,&quot; Abraham said. </p>

<h1>Prisons-R-Us </h1>

<p><b>The following is a summary of an article entitled,
&quot;Prisons-R-Us&quot; on the American Correctional Association
&quot;prisonfest&quot; held last month in Cincinnati, Ohio. The
article appeared in The Dayton Voice on September 20 and was
written by Alan Prendergast, a Denver based free-lance writer.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Copies of this issue of The Voice (Vol. 3, No. 38) can be

Dayton, OH 45406.</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>Here's the summary: </p>

<p>Sponsored by the American Correctional Association (ACA), this
Congress is the world's largest gathering of corrections
professionals -- roughly 5,000 prison guards and administrators,
educators, halfway house operators, and probation and parole
officers. It's also a flag-waving, back-patting, glad-handing
tribute to the growing power and prestige of the booming prison
industry. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, the keynote speaker,
gushed, &quot;You see the meanest, most vicious among us, and you
protect us from them...Well, I'm here today to tell you how much
this nation owes you.&quot; </p>

<p>And just how much does this nation owe the prison industry?
Plenty, judging from the hordes of exhibitors who descend on the
Congress every year, hoping to cash in on the prison boom. Even
as Reno spoke, more than 500 vendors were setting up shop in the
city's convention center, hawking everything from razor wire and
fancy restaint beds to inmate phone services and modular cells
that could be assembled like Lego blocks. </p>

<p>&quot;Business is great,&quot; reported Cathy Perry, an
account manager with Access Catalog of St. Louis, that sells
approved TVs, clothing, stereos and other personal items to
inmates by mail order, raking in roughly $5 million in sales last
year... </p>

<p>Thanks to stiffer drug laws, tougher parole requirements,
mandatory minimum sentences, &quot;three strikes&quot; laws and
other legislation, the American prison population has tripled
since 1980...The growth has been particularly dramatic -- and
painful in Ohio, which now competes with California for the
dubious honor of having the most overcrowded prison system in the
country. Niki Schwartz, the Cleveland attorney who helped
negociate an end to the Lucasville riot, is fond of pointing out
that Ohio's prison budget was 1/6 of its higher education budget
in 1982; as of 1993, it has risen to 1/3. &quot;Soon we'll be
spending more on corrections than on higher education, and that's
crazy,&quot; Schartz declares. </p>

<p>Punishment, not rehabilitation, is the name of the game... At
the 125th congress there was no shortage of speeches denouncing
the current prison binge, an indication of the growing anxiety
among corrections professionals over swollen budgets, crowded
prisons, and increasing punitive legislation that is making those
prisons harder to manage. </p>

<p>Jim Gondles, the soft-spoken, genial executive director of the
ACA, says the biggest task facing the ACA is&quot;educating
people who don't work in corrections&quot; about the industries
growing professionalism and changing needs. </p>

<p>One of the ACA's principal sources of revenue is the
Commission on Accreditation for Corrections, which promotes
professional standards and &quot;audits&quot; prisons as part of
the accreditation process. Accreditation is no guarantee that
conditions within a prison are constitutional or even safe, but
the operators or more than 1,200 jails and prisons have invested
millions in training and renovation in an effort to meet ACA
standards. </p>

<p>Gondles urged &quot;a balanced&quot; approach to corrections,
meaning more of everything: more halfway houses, more rehab
programs, more boot camps, more prisons. And that's an agenda the
corrections' industry boosters can live with -- espeacilly its
gung-ho private sector constituency, which has expanded rapidly
as public monies invested in corrections have soared. </p>

<p>Although private prisons are still a rarity, virtually every
aspect of corrections now involves some degree of public-private
partnership. </p>

<p>Some aspects of privitazation involve lucrative kickbacks to
corrections agencies, at the expense of prisoners and their
families. Phone companies bid agressively for the right to
provide costly, hi-tech phone services to prisoners...the
companies offer a commission on billing revenues to the prison
that range as high as 35%. Inmate collect calls are a sore point
with Charles Sullivan, director of CURE (Citizens United for
Rehabilitation of Errants), a national prison reform lobbying
group. </p>

<p>The cost of an inmate phone call can vary widely from system
to system, depending on what the phone companies can slide past
the regulators. &quot;We don't think that kind of gouging is
right,&quot; Sullivan says, &quot;Why should prisons be making
money from families on inmate phone calls?&quot; </p>

<p>Even the building of prisons is not as straightforward as it
once was. </p>

<p>Typically, the state corrections system will &quot;lease&quot;
a new prison from a state authority, which issues bonds through
private underwriters such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and
Prudential. The investors receive a significantly higher rate of
interest than that paid by general obligation bonds. &quot;Prison
bonds are a good investment,&quot; reports Brad Sprague, an
investment banker with Columbus office of A.G. Edwards Co.
&quot;I put my kid's money in them. You get individual investors,
bank trust departments, mutual funds, insurance companies -- they
all know the state of Ohio isn't going to go out of the prison
business anytime soon.&quot; </p>

<p>But Gondles senses that public concern about prison costs and
conditions is rising. &quot;We are going to see more citizens
interested in jails and prisons, &quot;he predicts, &quot;The
rate of incarceration is becoming so high that we are going to
reach a point where everyone knows someone who is in jail or
prison.&quot; </p>

<h1>Netherlands Revises Drug Policy </h1>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> THE HAGUE, Sept 15 (Reuter) - The Netherlands, which
tolerates the use of soft drugs like cannabis, on Friday
signalled a tougher approach to hard drugs. </p>

<p> Acknowledging that drug-related offences and links with
organised crime are on the increase, the government said it
planned to build more jail cells and step up existing mandatory
drug rehabilitation programmes. </p>

<p> But it made clear it will continue to tolerate its famous
coffee shops, where marijuana and cannabis are sold openly, and
the growing of home-grown cannabis. </p>

<p> The proposals will moderate a 20-year social experiment that
involved tolerating soft drugs and viewing hard-drug users as
people needing help rather than as criminals. </p>

<p> It turned Amsterdam into a mecca for Europe's drug-seeking
youth while critics said it allowed organised crime to flourish. </p>

<p> It angered neighbouring countries and France threatened to
block the Schengen agreement on open borders because of the flow
of drugs from the Netherlands. </p>

<p> ``The cabinet rejects legalisation of soft and hard drugs,''
the Dutch government said in a review of its drugs policy. </p>

<p> ``Tracking and prosecuting drug traffickers, particularly
those with cross-border operations, will continue to be given top
priority by the Dutch police and the judiciary,'' it said. </p>

<p> It signalled a tougher stand against so-called drug tourists
who flock in to buy cheap, readily available heroin and cocaine.
The cabinet insisted, however, that it would continue to treat
addicts as people who need help rather than as criminals and will
also maintain distinct policies on hard and soft drugs. </p>

<p> The proposals recommend providing free heroin to chronic
addicts under a trial scheme to be launched in Rotterdam. </p>

<p> Justice Minister Winnie Sorgdrager told Dutch television:
``None of us advocates the use of drugs, nor tobacco or alcohol,
but we know that they are used.'' </p>

<p> ``Bona fide coffee shops have proved their worth,'' the
government said, but it added that the amount of cannabis these
shops would be allowed to sell for personal use would be cut to
five grammes per transaction from 30 grammes. </p>

<p> ``Provided the strictest conditions are met, the police and
judiciary will not take active action against the small-scale
growing of Dutch-grown cannabis,'' the government said. </p>

<p> Lovers of home-grown Dutch grass -- known as Nederweed or
``skunk'' on the streets -- have claimed this will help keep
organised crime out of the soft drugs business. </p>

<p> ``We have 675,000 regular soft drug users in The Netherlands,
but even so there are only 25,000 hard drugs addicts,'' Health
Minister Els Borst said. </p>

<p> ``These figures confirm our view that if one keeps the two
markets separate it becomes possible that people use soft drugs,
sometimes experimenting with them for years -- and then stop.'' </p>

<p> ``Stopping (using soft drugs) is also easier because no
physical dependency is created. (Soft drug users) may do this
without stepping up to hard drugs,'' she said. </p>

<h1>ACCLAIMED TEACHER ARRESTED ON MARIJUANA CHARGES </h1>

<p><b>Dallas Morning News 10-13-95</b> </p>

<p>Slidell, La.-- A former teacher of the year in St. Tammany
Parish and her husband were arrested Thursday after deputies
found 10 marijuana plants growing in their home. Laurie Wilder
Maschek, 32, a fifth-grade teacher at Abney Elementary School,
and James Maschek, 34, face charges of marijuana cultivation and
possession with intent to distribute. Deputies said that the
plants, which were about 7-8 feet tall, were growing in specially
treated soil in individual plastic containers inside a room with
a 1,000-watt light bulb used to provide maximum growing
conditioins. Mrs. Maschek's plaque for being 1992 parish teacher
of the year was hanging behind the plants. </p>

<h1>Ruling aids grower of &quot;medicinal&quot; pot </h1>

<p> <b>BY CAROL M. OSTROM</b> </p>

<p> <b>Seattle Times staff reporter</b> </p>

<p> <b>10-3-95</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> There is good news and bad news for Joanna McKee and her
Green Cross Patient Co-op, busted earlier this year on Bainbridge
lsland for supplying what McKee says is &quot;medicinal
marijuana&quot; to people she describes as patients. </p>

<p> The good news is that Kitsap County Superior Court Judge
Leonard Kruse threw out the search warrant used in a May raid
when police seized 162 marijuana plants from McKee's home. </p>

<p> &quot;lf the warrant's no good, then all the evidence is out.
If the evidence is out, then we have no case to prosecute,&quot;
said Deputy Prosecutor Kevin Kelly. </p>

<p> The bad news for McKee is that it doesn't look like the
county plans to return her marijuana, estimated by
drug-enforcement officials to be worth about $300,000. </p>

<p> &quot;You can't give contraband back. The police would then
be guilty of delivery,&quot; said Kelly. &quot;You can't give
illegal drugs back to people.&quot; </p>

<p> McKee--the first medicinal-marijuana supplier in the country
to be busted, according to the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws-- said she's going to take Kitsap County
to court. </p>

<p> About 70 patients with AIDS, multiple sclerosis, cancer and
other illnesses who had depended on The Green Cross for marijuana
have been on &quot;basic rations&quot; since the bust, she said. </p>

<p> &quot;We are going after the county for damages and for all
of our stuff back,&quot; she said.&quot;We were not convicted of
a crime, and they have no right to take our edicine away. They
said they took $300,000 worth of medicine away from us. think
they owe us $300,000.&quot; </p>

<p> She said she would sue for an additional $200,000 for
&quot;pain and suffering ... and spending three days in jail with
no medication for my back.&quot; </p>

<p> The judge ruled that the search warrant was invalid because
it didn't limit the discretion of the officers, and didn't say
which items were to be seized. Marijuana was never mentioned in
the warrant, and no specific crime was alleged. In addition to
McKee, other defendants included Ronald &quot;Stitch&quot; Miller
and John Devin, who lived in the same household. </p>

<p> &quot;We're thrilled,&quot; said Andrew Subin, McKee's
attorney. &quot;We knew there were problems with the search
warrant; we're glad the judge saw those problems.&quot; </p>

<p> Kelly said his office had not decided whether to appeal the
ruling. </p>

<h1><a name="OLE_LINK1">Kids Drink, Use Drugs to Cope </a></h1>

<p> <b>Peer Pressure Actually Less of a Factor in Teen Drinking
Than Parents Think</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 18, 1995 /PRNewswire/ -- Parents often
believe that teenagers take most of their cues from their
friends. But new statistics show that peer pressure isn't as
important a factor in leading teens to drink alcohol as parents
may believe. Instead, teens feel that alcohol helps them forget
about their problems, according to a recent national survey
released today by the Minnesota-based Hazelden Foundation. </p>

<p> According to the survey statistics, parents are much more
likely to believe that peer pressure plays an important role in
influencing teens to drink or use drugs. Survey results show that
87 percent of parents said teens drink or use drugs because
&quot;everybody else is doing it.&quot; Seventy-nine percent of
parents also pointed to the fact that &quot;other kids will think
they're weird if they don't&quot; as an important factor in why
teens drink. On the other hand, 79 percent of teens pointed to
&quot;the feeling of being drunk or high&quot; as their top
reason for drinking or using drugs. Teens (66.7 percent) also
said that drugs and alcohol &quot;help them forget their
problems.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;The adolescent years are difficult for kids to
experience,&quot; says Cathy Seward, executive director of
Hazelden's Center for Youth and Families (HCYF). &quot;Parents
shouldn't rule out the possibility that their children could be
tempted to turn to alcohol and drugs to cope.&quot; HCYF is one
of the nation's only adolescent and young adult centers
specializing in alcoholism and chemical dependency treatment and
education for youth ages 14-25. Last year, more than 550 young
adults from throughout the United States benefited from HCYF
programs and services. </p>

<p> TEENS MORE REALISTIC ABOUT SUBSTANCE ABUSE </p>

<p> According to HCYF professionals, alcohol abuse is a more
serious problem among youth today, and teens appear to agree.
Fifty percent of the teens said alcohol is the most serious
problem among youth today. Parents were more evenly divided, with
only 36.4 percent rating alcohol as the most serious and 38.5
percent rating drugs to be a more serious problem. </p>

<p> Twenty-four percent of parents rated both alcohol and drugs a
serious problem in contrast to only six percent of teens. </p>

<p> &quot;Parents today seem to be most concerned about the
effect of hard drugs, such as marijuana and cocaine, on the lives
of their kids,&quot; says Seward. &quot;In reality, alcohol is
still overwhelmingly the primary drug of choice among teens. Kids
who start off experimenting with alcohol are often more likely to
get hooked and turn to harder drugs to get the 'high' feelings
that originally attracted them to drinking.&quot; </p>

<p> PARENTS LIMIT DRUG USE MORE THAN ALCOHOL </p>

<p> When asked to describe the kind of &quot;ground rules&quot;
families had about drug and alcohol use, survey results show
parents set more rigid guidelines for their kids when it comes to
drug use. Both parents and teens agreed at a margin of two to one
that drug use isn't tolerated in the family. </p>

<p> When it comes to outlining specific family rules about
alcohol and drug consumption, parents are much more lenient
toward alcohol -- allowing their teenagers to see them drinking
alcohol and admitting their teens can drink alcohol in a variety
of settings. </p>

<p> Specifically: 21.8 percent of the parents said alcohol
consumption is all right for parents but not teens; 8.3 percent
of parents allow their kids to drink alcohol at home; and 4.7
percent of parents said they allow their teens to drink alcohol
at parties as long as he/she doesn't drive home. </p>

<p> According to survey results, none of these &quot;ground
rules&quot; is allowed when it comes to drug use. </p>

<p> COMMUNICATION GAP EXISTS BETWEEN PARENTS AND TEENS </p>

<p> Even when parents say they have discussed alcohol and drug
use with their teens, survey results show that such discussions
may not have the effect that the parents hoped for. According to
the survey statistics, nearly all of the parents (95.6 percent)
said they have talked to their teenagers about alcohol use. Only
84 percent of the teens surveyed agreed. </p>

<p> While fewer parents -- 92.5 percent -- have discussed drug
use with their teens, the discrepancy with teens is even higher
-- with only 78.5 percent of the youth remembering a discussion
about drug use. </p>

<p> &quot;When talking with kids about alcohol and drug use,
parents need to be extremely clear about the consequences and
potential dangers that can affect their teens,&quot; says Seward.
&quot;It's best to sit down with your child and use real life
examples to illustrate some of the harm that comes to teens who
continue to experiment with drugs.&quot; </p>

<p> OTHER FINDINGS IN THE HAZELDEN SURVEY: </p>

<p> -- When asked how they would react if they found out that
their teen was drinking or using drugs, twice as many parents (87
percent) said they would &quot;sit down and talk it out&quot; as
compared to other options such as grounding their teenager (44
percent) or forbidding their teenager from &quot;hanging around
with the friends who got him/her started in the first
place,&quot; (41 percent). </p>

<p> -- Despite the fact that almost 40 percent (38.1 percent) of
teens surveyed admit they have friends or classmates who both
drink alcohol and use drugs, approximately one third (30 percent)
of parents said they are unsure about whether their teenager has
friends or classmates who use alcohol. An almost equal number of
parents -- an additional 28 percent -- said their teens have
friends who both drink alcohol and use drugs. </p>

<p> -- Parents (36 percent) and teens (40 percent) agreed that
teens at school plan activities that revolve around alcohol and
drugs on a weekly basis. Yet 20 percent of the teens surveyed
admit that teens plan activities that revolve around alcohol or
drugs even more often -- on a daily basis. </p>

<p> -- When asked to rank behaviors that would make them think a
friend had a drug or alcohol problem, teens listed the following:
personality changes (80.4 percent); pressuring others to use
(75.6 percent); giving up favorite activities (69.3 percent);
lying about things (68.5 percent); receiving falling grades (65.6
percent) or avoiding friends (44.8 percent). </p>

<p> -- When asked what they felt would be the top results of
ongoing drug use, teenagers pointed to getting hooked (89.3
percent); death (82.6 percent); and a car crash (81.1 percent) as
primary concerns. Teens ranked unprotected sex (58 percent) as
the least likely result of ongoing drug or alcohol use. </p>

<p> TEENS COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT CHEMICAL USE BUT AVOID TOPIC </p>

<p> When asked hypothetically about their comfort level in
talking with friends about drinking or drug use, more than
three-fourths (77 percent) of the teens said they felt very or
somewhat confident and comfortable discussing the topic. Yet in
reality, less than half of the teens surveyed who know friends or
classmates who used alcohol and/or drugs (44 percent) have ever
talked with them about their drug or alcohol use and tried to
offer help. Fifty-five percent of the teens surveyed said they
had never broached the subject with their friends. </p>

<p> &quot;Teenagers tend to listen to the opinions of their
friends more than their parents,&quot; says Seward. &quot;This
makes it very important that friends take any opportunities to
talk to each other about worries associated with drug and alcohol
abuse.&quot; </p>

<p> HAZELDEN OFFERS HELP IN DISCUSSING DRUG USE </p>

<p> To help parents and teens discuss the topic of alcohol and
drug use, Hazelden's Responsibility of Friendship program has
developed &quot;A Guide For Teens,&quot; a free booklet designed
to help teens assist a friend who has a problem with alcohol or
other related drugs. </p>

<p> To get a copy of Hazelden's &quot;A Guide For Teens,&quot;
call Hazelden's toll-free helpline, 800-I-DO-CARE. The helpline
was created by Hazelden in 1992 in response to a widespread need
for information. </p>

<p> ABOUT THE SURVEY </p>

<p> The telephone survey, conducted for the Minnesota-based
Hazelden Center for Youth and Families and the Hazelden
Foundation by Market Facts, Inc., polled a nationally
representative sample of more than 300 parents and 270 teenagers
to learn their opinions about drug and alcohol use and whether or
not kids ever talk to friends about usage. (The margin of error
for the sample is plus or minus 6 percentage points). </p>

internationally recognized nonprofit organization providing
low-cost, quality rehabilitation, education, prevention and
professional services in chemical dependency and related
addictive disorders. </p>

<h1>Prepared Statement of Steven Wisotsky, Professor of Law, </h1>

<p><font size="2">Nova University Law Center, before the select

Representatives, Concerning: A New Beginning in U.S. Drug Policy,
September 29th, 1988, pp.410-454. <br>

<p><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[T]he history of the narcotics legislation in the country
&quot;reveals the determination of congress to turn the screw of
the criminal machinery -- detection, prosecution and punishment
-- tighter and tighter.&quot; </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court in _Albernaz v. United States_, 450
U.S. 333, 343 (1981)<br>
</p>

<p>The chief cause of problems is solutions -- Eric Sevareid<br>
</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my appreciation to the
Committee for inviting me to participate in this important
hearing on U.S. Drug Policy. This hearing could be and should be
the start of a new beginning in the conception and execution of
our drug laws. Indeed, if there is one over-riding theme in my
prepared statement, it is just that: more than anything else --
more than revised laws or the commitment of new resources -- we
need a careful, comprehensive study of the costs and benefits of
present drug policy, followed by a clear articulation of the
fundamental goals sought to be achieved by our drug policy. </p>

<p>First, let me identify myself for the record. I am both a
lawyer and a law professor. I have been a full-time member of the
law faculty of the Nova University Law Center since 1975. </p>

<p>One of my primary areas of specialization is the criminal
justice system. Since the late 1970s, I have followed
developments in U.S. drug law. With the aid of a grant from the
Nova Law Center in 1982, I published what is to my knowledge the
first critique of the U.S. War on Drugs, the substance of which
is clearly indicated by its title, 'Exposing the War on Cocaine:
The Futility and Destructiveness of Prohibition', 1983 _Wisconsin
Law Review_ 1305. (1) </p>

<p>My published work in this field has been cited widely by the
press, being summarized, for example, in the _Atlantic Monthly_
cover story on cocaine, of January 1986. I am most widely known
as the author of _Breaking the Impasse in the War on Drugs_,
reviewed in the _New York Times_ Book Review Section in December
1986. I have spoken on drug law and policy at many panels and
conferences in the United States and in Europe. </p>

<p>My prepared statement for this hearing addresses three
fundamental questions. What is the state of the War on Drugs? How
did we get there? Where should we go from here? </p>

<p>The current 'War on Drugs' began on October 2nd, 1982, with a
radio address by President Reagan to the Nation: &quot;The mood
towards drugs is changing in this country and the momentum is
with us. We are making no excuses for drugs hard, soft, or
otherwise. Drugs are bad and we are going after them&quot;.(2)
Twelve days later, in a speech delivered at the Department of
Justice, the President followed with an &quot;unshakable&quot;
commitment &quot;to do what is necessary to end the drug
menace&quot; and &quot;to cripple the power of the mob in
America.&quot;(3) He cited the &quot;unqualified success&quot; of
the Miami Task Force on Crime and Drugs as a model to build
on.(4) It is important to note that President Reagan was not the
first to declare war on drugs. President Nixon had done the same
in 1971. In a message to Congress he had described drug abuse as
a &quot;national emergency&quot;, denounced drugs as &quot;public
enemy number one&quot; and called for a &quot;total
offensive&quot;.(5) First Drug War or not, the President's
statement about the mood of the country seemed accurate. At the
time of his October 1982 speeches, some 3,000 parents groups had
already organized nationwide under the umbrella of the National
Federation of Parents for Drug Free Youth.(6) Within the
government, the House Select Committee(7) and the attorney
general's Task Force on Violent Crime(8) had urged the President
to declare War on Drugs. </p>

<p>The President's October 14th speech called for and got more of
nearly everything:(9) 1.more personnel -- 1,020 law enforcement
agents for the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), and other agencies, 200 Assistant United
States Attorneys, and 340 clerical staff; 2.more aggressive law
enforcement -- creating 12 (later 13) regional prosecutorial task
forces across the nation &quot;to identify, investigate, and
prosecute members of high-level drug trafficking enterprises, and
to destroy the operations of those organizations&quot;; 3.more
money -- $127.5 million in additional funding and a substantial
reallocation of the existing budget from prevention, treatment,
and research programs to law enforcement programs; 4.more prison
bed space -- the addition of 1,260 beds at eleven federal prisons
to accommodate the increase in drug offenders to be incarcerated;
5.more stringent laws -- a &quot;legislative offensive designed
to win approval of reforms&quot; with respect to bail,
sentencing, criminal forfeiture, and the exclusionary rule;
6.better interagency coordination -- bringing together all
federal law enforcement agencies in &quot;a comprehensive attack
on drug trafficking and organized crime&quot; under a
Cabinet-level committee chaired by the attorney general; and
7.improved federal-state co-ordination, including federal
assistance to state agencies by training their agents. </p>

<p>Energized by the hardening attitude toward illegal drugs, the
administration acted aggressively, mobilizing an impressive array
of federal bureaucracies and resources in a co-ordinated,
although largely futile, attack on the supply of illegal drugs --
principally cocaine, marijuana, and heroin. The administration
hired hundreds of drug agents and cut through bureaucratic
rivalries with greater vigor than any administration before it.
It acted to streamline operations and compel more co-operation
among enforcement agencies. It placed the FBI in charge of DEA
and gave it major drug enforcement responsibility for the first
time in its history.(10) And, as the centerpiece of its
prosecutorial strategy, it fielded a network of Organized Crime
Drug Enforcement Task Forces in 13 'core' cities across the
nation.(11) </p>

<p>To stop drugs from entering the country, the Administration
attempted to erect a contemporary anti-drug version of the
Maginot Line: the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System
(NNBIS), an intelligence network designed to co-ordinate radar
surveillance and interdiction efforts along the entire
96,000-mile border of the United States. As part of that
initiative, NNBIS floated radar balloons in the skies over Miami,
the Florida Keys, and even the Bahamas to protect the nation's
perimeter against drug-smuggling incursions.(12) </p>

<p>The CIA joined the war effort by supplying intelligence about
foreign drug sources, and NASA assisted with satellite-based
surveillance of coca and marijuana crops under cultivation.(13) </p>

<p>The administration also initiated financial investigations,
aided by computerized data banks and staffed by Treasury agents
specially trained to trace money-laundering operations.(14) The
State Department pressured foreign governments to eradicate
illegal coca and marijuana plants and financed pilot programs to
provide peasant farmers with alternative cash crops.(15) It also
negotiated Mutual Assistance Treaties to expose 'dirty' money
secreted in tax-haven nations and to extradite defendants accused
of drug conspiracies against the laws of the United States.(16) </p>

<p>The government also literally militarized what had previously
been only a rhetorical war, deploying the armed forces of the
United States to &quot;assist&quot; drug enforcement operations.
The Department of Defense provided pursuit planes, helicopters,
and other equipment to federal civilian enforcement agencies,
while Navy E-2C 'Hawkeye' radar planes patrolled the coastal
skies in search of smuggling aircraft and ships.(17) The Coast
Guard, receiving new cutters and more personnel, intensified its
customary task of interdicting drug-carrying vessels at sea. </p>

<p>1981 amendments to the Posse Comitatus Act relaxed the
century-old ban on military enforcement of criminal laws and
permitted Coast Guard boarding parties to sail on Naval warships
serving as 'platforms' for Coast Guard interdictions.(18)
Finally, for the first time in American history, Navy vessels,
including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, began directly to
interdict -- and in one case fired upon -- drug smuggling ships
in international waters.(19) On a purely technical level, the
Administration could rightly claim some success in focusing the
resources of the federal government in a historically large and
single-minded attack on the drug supply. </p>

<p>What were the results of this extraordinary enforcement
program? It set new records in every category of measurement --
drug seizures, investigations, indictments, arrests, convictions,
and asset forfeitures. For example, DEA, FBI and Customs seized
nearly one-half billion dollars in drug-related assets in
1986.(20) DEA arrested twice as many drug offenders in 1986
(12,819) as in 1982, and the percentage of arrestees constituting
high-level traffickers also rose from roughly one-third to
one-half.(21) DEA, FBI, and other federal agencies seized over
100,000 lbs. Of cocaine in 1986.(22) From the end of 1980 to June
30, 1987, the prison population (counting felonies only) soared
from 329,021 to 570,519. Roughly 40 percent of new prison inmates
now go in for drug offenses. In recognition of this boom, the
1989 budget submission of the President seeks a 48 percent
increase for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in order to accommodate
an anticipated increase in prisoners from 44,000 today to 72,000
by 1995. Despite the Administration's accumulation of impressive
statistics, domestic marijuana cultivation took off and the black
market in cocaine grew to record size. In 1980, the supply of
cocaine to the U.S. was estimated at 40 metric tons; by 1986 it
had risen to 140 tons. As a result of this abundant supply and a
more-or-less stable pool of buyers, prices fell dramatically. In
1980, a kilo of cocaine cost $50,000 - $55,000 delivered in
Miami; by 1986, it had fallen to the range of $12,000 - $20,000;
$14,000 was typical for much of 1988. In 1980-81, a gram of
cocaine cost $ 100 and averaged 12 percent purity at street
level. By 1986, the price had fallen to as low as $80 ($50 in
Miami), and the purity had risen to more than 50 percent.(23)
Around the nation, crack was marketed in $5 and $10 vials to
reach the youth and low-income markets.(24) More than 22 million
Americans report having tried cocaine; and roughly 5.8 million
report having used it during the month preceding the 1985
National Household Survey.(25) Cocaine-related hospital
emergencies rose from 4,277 in 1982 to 9,946 in 1985, and then to
more than 26,000 in 987.(26) </p>

<p>As if to mock the aggressive efforts of the War on Drugs, this
rapid market growth occurred in the face of President Reagan's
doubling and redoubling of the federal anti-drug enforcement
budget from $645 million in fiscal year 1981 to over $4 billion
in fiscal year 1987.(27) Resources specifically devoted to
interdiction rose from $399 million to $ 1.3 billion, one third
of the current budget; and military assistance rose from $5
million to $405 million,(28) including the provision of (the
services of) Air Force AWAC'S and Navy E-2C radar planes; Army
Black Hawk helicopters used in Customs pursuit missions; and the
Customs Service's own purchases of P-3 radar planes, Citation jet
interceptors, and Blue Thunder interceptor boats. DEA personnel
rose from 1,940 in 1981 to 2,875 special agents in 1988, with
more on request for 1989, along with a 47-position air wing for
DEA. </p>

<p>This budgetary expansion seems all the more remarkable when
compared to the 1969 anti-drug budget of $73.5 million.(29)
Commenting specifically upon the interdiction budget, the Office
of Technology Assessment concluded: </p>

<p>Despite a doubling of Federal expenditures on interdiction
over the past five years, the quantity of drugs smuggled into the
United States is greater than ever.... There is no clear
correlation between the level of expenditures or effort devoted
to interdiction and the long- term availability of
illegally-imported drugs in the domestic market.(30) </p>

<p>The social 'return' on the extra billions spent during that
time has been a drug abuse problem of historic magnitude,
accompanied by a drug trafficking parasite of international
dimensions. </p>

<p>This latter point is crucial. It is not simply that the War on
Drugs has failed to work; it has in many respects made things
worse. It has spun a spider's web of black market pathologies,
including roughly 25 percent of all urban homicides, widespread
corruption of police and other public officials, street crime by
addicts, and subversive 'narcoterrorist' alliances between Latin
American guerrillas and drug traffickers.(31) In the streets of
the nation's major cities, violent gangs of young drug thugs
engage in turf wars and open shoot-outs with automatic
rifles.(32) Innocent bystanders are often shot. Corruption
pervades local police departments and foreign governments. Some
Latin American and Caribbean nations have been effectively
captured by drug traffickers.(33 ) Where capture is incomplete,
intimidation reigns: one third of the Clombian supreme court was
assassinated in a (suspected) narco-terrorist raid. An estimated
60 Colombian justices have been murdered in a recent five-year
period.(34) </p>

<p>Of course, these pathologies were foreseeable. They are a
function of money. Drug law yields to a higher law: the law of
the marketplace, the law of supply and demand. The naive attack
on the drug supply through an aggressive program of enforcement
at each step -- interdiction, arrest, prosecution, and punishment
-- results in what Stanford Law School Professor Herbert Packer
has called a &quot;crime tariff'.(35) The crime tariff is what
the seller must charge the buyer in order to monetize the risk he
takes in breaking the law. It is in short a premium for taking
risks. The criminal law thereby maintains hyper-inflated prices
for illegal drugs in the black market. </p>

<p>For example, an ounce of pure pharmaceutical cocaine at
roughly $80, just under $3.00 per gram, becomes worth about
$4,480 if sold in the black market at $80 per diluted gram (at
50% purity). The crime tariff is thus $4,400 per ounce. This type
of law enforcement succeeds to some unknown extent in making
drugs less available -- to the extent (probably slight) that
demand is elastic or sensitive to price. But because the crime
tariff is paid to lawbreakers rather than the Government, it
pumps vast sums of money into the black market, more than $100
billion per year by government estimate.(36) The flow of these
illegal billions through the underground economy finances or
supplies the incentives for the pathologies described above:
homicides, street crime, public corruption and international
narcoterrorism. If these phenomena were properly costed out, one
might well conclude that the War on Drugs makes a net negative
contribution to the safety, well-being and national security
interests of the American people. </p>

<p>Confronted by these threatening developments, both the public
and the politicians predictably react in fear and anger. The
specter of uncontrolled and seemingly uncontrollable drug abuse
and black marketeering leads to frustrated reaction against the
drug trade. The zeal to &quot;turn the screw of the criminal
machinery -- detection, prosecution, and punishment -- tighter
and tighter&quot;(37) leads directly to the adoption of
repressive and punitive measures that aggrandize governmental
powers at the expense of individual rights. </p>

<p>This reactive, almost reflexive growth of governmental power
and the correlative squelching of personal liberty occur as two
closely related, if not inseparable, phenomena: 1.the
government's sustained attack, motivated by the perceived
imperatives of drug enforcement, on traditional protections
afforded to criminal defendants under the Bill of Rights, and
2.the gradual but perceptible rise of 'Big Brotherism' against
the public at large in the form of drug testing, investigative
detention, eavesdropping, surveillance, monitoring, and other
intrusive enforcement methods. </p>

<p>It may be difficult for those not familiar with criminal law
and procedure to understand the degree to which the War on Drugs
has disempowered the criminal defendant, especially in drug
cases. Perhaps by focusing on a few of the most important of the
many restrictions that have been imposed, one may begin to
appreciate the severity of the crackdown on the rights of those
accused of crime. </p>

<p>First, let us consider pre-trial detention. It is important to
understand that in the U.S. the law has always favored pre-trial
release to reinforce the presumption of innocence and to allow a
defendant to aid counsel in his defense. The Eighth Amendment to
the United States Constitution prohibits excessive bail; and
while the cases do not establish a 'right' to bail, the law has
evolved as if there were a presumptive right to pre-trial release
on bail (or other conditions) except in capital cases where
&quot;the proof is evident or the presumption great&quot;. This
was changed radically by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of
1984,(38) which not only authorized pre-trial detention but
created a statutory _presumption_ in favor of it in any case in
which, _inter alia_, the defendant is charged with a drug offense
punishable by ten years or more in prison.(39) Although the
presumption is rebuttable, in the first seven months under the
act, the government won 704 motions for pre-trial detention while
defendants won only 185.(40) Pre-trial detention is a severe blow
to the morale of a defendant and to his ability to assist in the
preparation of his defense.(41) </p>

<p>Another major erosion in the rights of defendants is the more
permissive use of illegally seized evidence. Since 1914, the
Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution has been interpreted to
exclude from use in court evidence obtained by federal law
enforcement authorities in an illegal search and seizure.(42)
Many states voluntarily adhered to that ruling, and in 1961 the
remaining states were required to do so by the decision of the
Supreme Court in _Mapp v. Ohio_.(43) But under the relentless
pressure of drug prosecutions and the frequent attempts of
Congress to repeal or restrict the exclusionary rule, the Courts
have whittled away at the protections afforded to individual
privacy. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the independence of the judicial branch, the
Courts have in effect joined the war on drugs. Most notably, the
U.S. Supreme Court gave its approval to just about every
challenged drug enforcement technique. For example, the Court
upheld the power of drug agents to use the airport drug courier
profile to stop, detain and question citizens without probable
cause;(44) to subject a traveller's luggage to a sniffing
examination by drug-detector dogs without probable cause;(45) to
make warrantless searches of automobiles and closed containers
therein;(46) to conduct surveillance of suspects by placing
transmitters or beepers in containers in vehicles;(47) to search
at will without cause ships in inland waterways;(48) and to
obtain a search warrant based on an undisclosed informant's
tip.(49) The Supreme Court also adopted a 'good-faith exception'
to the exclusionary rule for evidence seized in searches made
pursuant to defective warrants.(50) It authorized warrantless
searches of open fields and barns adjacent to a residence.(51) It
significantly enlarged the powers of police to stop, question,
and detain drivers of vehicles on the highways on suspicion less
than probable cause(52) or with no suspicion at all at fixed
checkpoints or road blocks.(53) The Court also validated
warrantless aerial surveillance, that is airplane overflights of
private property,(54) the warrantless search of a motor home
occupied as a residence,(55) and the warrantless search of the
purse of a public school student.(56) In the realm of search and
seizure, there is hardly a drug case that the government failed
to win. Indeed, the Supreme Court in _Albernaz_ apparently placed
its imprimatur on the turn-the-screw approach of the U.S.
Congress. Thus, the crackdown mentality prevails not only in the
political realm but, to use Madison's phrase, in &quot;the least
dangerous branch&quot; as well. </p>

<p>One further example of the crackdown atmosphere prevailing in
the U.S. comes from the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986,(57) in which
Congress not only created new crimes but added to the penalties
which already existed. The effect of the Act is that drug crimes
now rank among the most seriously punished offenses in the United
States Criminal Code. For example, the Act provides mandatory
minimum penalties of five and ten years in prison depending upon
drug and weight involved; in the case of possession with intent
to distribute five kilograms of cocaine, the penalty is a minimum
of ten years up to a maximum of life imprisonment. Even as little
as five grams of cocaine base require not less than five years in
prison and a maximum of 40 years. In both cases, the range of
penalties rises to a minimum of 20 years and a maximum of life if
death or serious bodily injury results from the use of such
substances. It should be emphasized that these penalties apply to
_first-time_ drug offenders; those with a prior state or federal
drug conviction must receive a _mandatory life term_ under these
circumstances. </p>

<p>The fact that these penalties are so severe, more stringent in
fact than sentences typically meted out to robbers or
rapists,(58) illustrates one of the themes of this statement:
people in the U.S. are so fearful and angry about their inability
to contain drug trafficking that they are resorting to extremist,
desperation measures. More than one public official has proposed
simply shooting suspected drug-carrying planes out of the sky.
The atmosphere is perhaps best conveyed by the judicial opinion
of a respected federal judge in Miami who, in an order denying
bail pending appeal, condemned drug dealers as &quot;merchants of
misery, destruction, and death&quot; whose greed has wrought
&quot;hideous evil&quot; and &quot;unimaginable sorrow&quot; upon
the nation. </p>

<p>Their crimes, he wrote, are &quot;unforgivable&quot;.(59) And
if drug crimes are literally &quot;unforgivable&quot;,
traditional constitutional and statutory protections for
individual rights can be discounted or discarded. One congressman
in fact complained about the extent to which legal protections
interfered with the prosecution of drug cases: &quot;[I]n the War
on Narcotics we have met the enemy and he is the U.S. code. I
have never seen such a maze of laws and hangups...&quot;(60) In
that spirit, and in the spirit of the angry judge just quoted,
the punitive measures I have described, along with dozens of
others, such as forfeiture of defense attorney's fees,(61) have
become 'logical' measures in an endless cycle of crackdowns and
failures. </p>

<p>Perhaps if these repressive laws applied only to drug
defendants, who could be dismissed as an alien 'them', few would
care and fewer still would protest. But this kind of reactionary
force cannot be contained, cannot apply only to those accused of
drug crime. In fact, the tentacles of drug enforcement have
already spread out to reach into the lives of ordinary people,
not just to those involved in the drug underworld. These
intrusions into the lives of civilian society take many forms.
One of the most obvious is the rapid proliferation of mandatory
drug testing of employees and job applicants in the U.S. Civil
Service,(62) state and local civil services, and in the private
sector as well. Some 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies now
subject their applicants or employees to urinalysis.(63)
Government surveillance is on the increase in the form of
wiretaps and the maintenance of 1.5 million or more names in
NADDIS, a drug investigative data bank. On a more prosaic level,
the War on Drugs hampers the mobility of travellers, who are
subjected to road blocks, detained for questioning at airports,
and whose luggage can be diverted for sniffing by drug-detector
dogs. </p>

<p>One of the latest repressive anti-drug initiatives to emerge
from Washington is called 'zero tolerance', begun by the Customs
Service on March 21st. It means, in a nutshell, punishing drug
users to promote 'user accountability' and to reduce 'the demand
side of the equation'. One manifestation of this policy occurs in
the effort to promote federal criminal prosecution of persons
found in possession of small amounts of drugs for which they
formerly would have escaped prosecution or been referred to local
authorities for prosecution. On March 30th, 1988 Attorney General
Meese sent a memorandum to all United States Attorneys
encouraging the selective prosecution of &quot;middle and upper
class users&quot; in order to &quot;send the message that there
is no such thing as 'recreational' drug use...&quot; </p>

<p>More widely known is the seizure and forfeiture of cars,
planes, or boats of persons found in possession of even trace
amounts of illegal drugs; these forfeited assets in effect impose
massive fines far greater than would ordinarily be imposed upon a
criminal conviction for drug possession; but as civil forfeiture
is in _rem_, no conviction or prosecution is required at all. </p>

<p>Some examples: On April 30th, the Coast Guard boarded and
seized the motor yacht _Ark Royal_, valued at $25 million,
because 10 marijuana _seeds_ and two stems were found aboard.
Public criticism prompted a return of the boat upon payment of $
1,600 in fines and fees by the owner. The 52-foot _Mindy_ was
impounded for a week because of cocaine dust in a rolled-up
dollar bill. The $80 million oceanographic research vessel
_Atlantis II_ was seized in San Diego whent he Coast Guard found
0.01 ounce of marijuana in a crewman's shaving kit. It was
returned also. But a Michigan couple returning from a Canadian
vacation lost the wife's 1987 Cougar when Customs agents found
two marijuana cigarettes in the pocket of her husband. No charges
were filed, but the car was kept by the government. In Key West,
Florida, David Phelps, a shrimp fisherman, lost his 73-foot
shrimper to the coast guard who found three grams of cannabis
seeds and stems aboard. Under the law, the boat is forfeitable
whether or not Phelps had any responsibility for the drugs. Three
weeks later, the boat had not been returned. There are many other
ways, too numerous to mention in this statement, that the War on
Drugs has choked off civil liberties in the U.S. </p>

<p>In 1987, the United States celebrated the bicentennial of its
Constitution. The framers of the Constitution were animated by
the spirit of William Pitt's dictum that &quot;unlimited power is
apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it.&quot;(64) They
therefore created a constitutional structure in which
governmental power was limited in the first instance and
constrained in the second by the system of checks and balances.
The Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution,
were added in 1791 to further secure personal freedom from
governmental oppression. </p>

<p>The War on Drugs has substantially undermined the American
tradition of limited government and personal autonomy. Since the
early 1980s, the prevailing attitude, both within Government and
in the broader society, has been that the crackdown on drugs is
so imperative that extraordinary measures are justified. The end
has come to justify the means. The result is that Americans have
significantly less freedom than they did only five or six years
ago.<br>
</p>

<p>DEVELOPMENTS IN 1988: POLARIZATION<br>
</p>

<p>Election year politics continues to ratchet the War on Drugs
machinery tighter and tighter. In June the Administration
declared its goal of a &quot;drug-free America&quot;.(65) During
the month of April, the Senate voted 93 to 0 to adopt the
Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, creating a $2.6 billion special
reserve fund for anti-drug programs over and above the regular
annual budget of three-plus billion dollars. (As noted above, the
regular budget represents a manifold increase in the level of
funding that prevailed when the war on drugs was declared.) The
frustration of Congress with drug-producing nations of Latin
America, crystallized by the stalemate with General Noriega in
Panama, has produced a number of controversial proposals
involving the threat of sanctions(66) and the use of military
force to destroy coca crops or to capture fugitives from U.S.
drug charges. Secretary Carlucci's opposition to arrest powers
for the military services may tone down the final bill, but an
expanded military surveillance role seems likely. At the state
level, the National Guard has already been deployed on anti-drug
search and destroy missions. </p>

<p>The President on April 19th &quot;call[ed] upon the House and
Senate to vote promptly on my bill providing for capital
punishment when a death results from drug dealing, and when a...
law enforcement officer is murdered.&quot; In the latest piece of
fundamentalist-style anti-drug zealotry, the House on September
22nd voted 375-30 to adopt capital punishment, for a drug
exception to the exclusionary rule, to deny college student loans
to anyone convicted of possessing drugs, to impose without trial
up to $10,000 in &quot;civil fines&quot; for a person caught in
possession of drugs, and to impose a mandatory five-year prison
sentence on anyone convicted of possession of crack cocaine.
Other &quot;zero tolerance&quot; style bills abound. A House
Republican Task force has introduced a bill calling for
confiscation of 25 percent of the adjusted gross income and net
assets of anyone caught possessing illegal substances. It would
also cut off federal highway funds to states that do not suspend
drivers' licenses of persons convicted of using drugs.(67) As we
get closer to the November election, one can predict with
confidence that more of these proposals will surface and that
their extremist nature will increase. </p>

<p>But at the same time there is movement in the opposite
direction. Respected journalists and other opinion leaders have
begun to break ranks with the War on Drugs, in some cases
suggesting that it be abandoned altogether. Here are some notable
examples. David Boaz, Vice President for public policy at
libertarian-oriented Cato Institute, wrote an op-ed piece for the
_New York Times_ (March 17th) &quot;Let's Quit the Drug
War&quot;. In it he denounced the war on drugs as
&quot;unwinnable&quot; and destructive to other values such as
civil liberties and advocated a &quot;withdrawal&quot; from the
war. Edwin M. Yoder Jr. of the _Washington Post_ Writers Group
called the war on drugs &quot;dumb&quot; and compared it to the
prohibition of alcohol for &quot;encouraging and enriching
mobsters&quot; (March 4th, 1988). On March 10th, 1988, Richard
Cohen of the _Los Angeles Times_ Syndicate published a piece
endorsing the idea of a plan for the government distribution of
drugs in order to &quot;recognize the drug problem is with us to
stay -- a social and medical problem, but not necessarily a
law-enforcement one. We've been making war on drugs long enough.
It's time we started making sense instead.&quot; By May and June,
articles of this type became a staple item in newspapers all over
the country as editors hopped aboard the &quot;legalization&quot;
bandwagon. </p>

<p>This sample of articles shows the emergence of a significant
body of opinion opposed to the war on drugs. What is perhaps even
more significant is that the opposition transcends the
liberal/conservative split. Traditionally, conservatives have
advocated strict law enforcement and liberals have been
identified with a permissive approach to the drug issue. Now
highly respected conservative spokesmen have also begun to
dissent from the War on Drugs. </p>

<p>Even before the recent spate of articles described above,
prominent conservative columnist William F . Buckley Jr. had
reversed his position and advocated the legalization of drugs as
the only effective course of governmental action. Nobel
Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman has made public
statements advocating more market-oriented approaches to the
regulation of drugs. _National Review_, the most prominent organ
of conservative opinion, through its editor Richard Vigilante,
published a piece (December 5th, 1986) exposing the Anti Drug
Abuse Act of 1986 as a manifestation of public panic and
criticizing the intrusiveness of drug testing and other
enforcement measures. He also rejected the war on drugs as
intolerant and politically unwise: &quot;Embracing the drug
hysteria requires a rejection of essential conservative
principles.&quot; In the same issue of NR is an article by
Richard C. Cowan, entitled 'How the Narcs Created Crack', arguing
as follows: &quot;Any realistic approach to the drug problem must
begin with the legalization of small scale cultivation and sale
of marijuana so that it is separated from the other, more
dangerous drugs.... We need not fear that if we stop the lying
and hypocrisy, the American people are going to destroy
themselves with drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>This debate has captured the attention of the mainstream
media.(69) Clearly, the challenge to the monopoly status of the
War on Drugs is gaining ground. Nothing approaching this level of
dissent has been seen or heard since the War on Drugs started. </p>

<p>The dissent has also begun to spill over to the political
sector. For example, the _ABA Journal_ (January l st, l 988)
reported that the New York County Lawyers Association Committee
on Law Reform published a report advocating the decriminalization
of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana. New York State Senator Joseph
L. Galiber, from a district in the drug-ravaged Bronx, introduced
on April 18th a bill in the New York State legislature to
decriminalize the possession, distribution, sale, and use of all
forms of controlled substances under the aegis of a
State-Controlled Substance Authority. At a speech at the National
Conference of Mayors and again on a May 10th, 1988, broadcast of
ABC's 'Nightline', the Mayor of Baltimore called for
congressional hearings to study the issue. Other mayors and a few
congressmen supported him. And, surprisingly, Congressman Charles
Rangel, Chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse
and Control, scheduled a one-day hearing for September 29th,
1988, clearly inadequate for the task at hand, yet perhaps a
harbinger of the future. Even if nothing constructive can emerge
amidst election year maneuvering, at least the genie of change is
out of the bottle. </p>

<p>There are also pressures beginning to come from abroad. For
example, the attorney general of Colombia said in a telephone
interview with the _Miami Herald_ (February 23rd, 1988) that
Colombia's battles against drug-trafficking rings have been a
failure, calling them &quot;useless&quot;. He suggested that
legalizing the drug trade is something that the government
&quot;may have to consider&quot; in the future. _The Economist_
magazine ran a cover story (April 2-8) called 'Getting Gangsters
Out of Drugs', advocating the legalized and taxed distribution of
controlled substances. It followed up with similar commentaries
on May 21st and June 4th. _El Pais_, the most influential Spanish
newspaper, also recommended &quot;La legalizacion de la
droga&quot; in an editorial (May 22nd, 1988).What accounts for
this trend? Negative experience with the War on Drugs certainly
plays a role. In the _Structure of Scientific Revolutions_,
Thomas S. Kuhn argued that &quot;the process by which a new
candidate for paradigm replaces its predecessors&quot; occurs
&quot;only after persistent failure to solve a noteworthy puzzle
has given rise to crisis&quot; (pp.144-45). There is little doubt
that the perception that the War on Drugs is a failure at
controlling drug supply has spread significantly. </p>

<p>Uncritical acceptance of the War on Drugs is no longer
possible. And the perception that it has negative side effects,
breeding crime, violence and corruption, has spread even to the
comic pages of the daily newspapers.(69) In a more serious vein,
Ted Koppel's &quot;Nightline&quot; broadcast a special three-hour
&quot;National Town Forum&quot; on the subject of legalization.
Perhaps we have already reached Kuhn's stage of &quot;persistent
failure and crisis&quot;, in which the war on drugs has been
dislodged as the only conceivable paradigm for the control of
drugs in the U.S. What now should be done? </p>

<p>One rationale for requiring that urinalysis be predicated upon
individual suspicion is the not-unlikely possibility of a false
positive result: &quot;Two Navy doctors were almost drummed out
of the service [in 1984] because they tested positive for
morphine, the result of having eaten too many poppy seed bagels.
Indeed, the Navy program has seen huge errors&#139;over 4,000 men

<hr>

<p>TOWARD A NEW BEGINNING IN DRUG CONTROL<br>
</p>

<p>One historically tested model of exploring policy reform is
the appointment of a National Study Commission of experts,
politicians and lay leaders to make findings of fact, canvass a
full range of policy options, and recommend further research
where needed. The precedent set by the National Commission on
Marijuana and Drug Abuse in the early 1970s offers a model that
might usefully be emulated in many respects. At the very least, a
National Commission performs a vital educational function: its
public hearings and attendant media coverage inform the public,
bringing to their attention vital facts and a broader array of
policy options. The level of public discourse is almost certain
to be elevated. Only those who prefer ignorance to knowledge
could possibly oppose the commission process.What should be the
agenda of such a commission? Its over-riding goal should be to
develop policies directed toward the objectives of 1.reducing
drug abuse and 2.reducing the black-market pathologies resulting
from the billions in drug money generated by drug law
enforcement. In pursuit of these dual goals, the commission's
study might benefit from adherence to the following five points: <br>
</p>

<p>I. DEFINE THE DRUG PROBLEM </p>

<p>What exactly is the problem regarding drugs in the U.S.? The
absence of an agreed-upon answer to this question is one of the
primary sources of incoherence in present law and policy. People
now speak of &quot;the drug problem&quot; in referring to at
least five very different phenomena: 1. the mere use of any
illegal drugs; 2. especially by teenagers; 3. the abuse of
illegal drugs; 4. drug-induced misbehavior that endangers or
harms others, such as driving while impaired; and 5.
drug-trafficking phenomena (crime, violence, and corruption)
arising from the vast sums of money generated in the black market
in drugs. </p>

<p>This confusion in the very statement of the problem
necessarily engenders confusion in solving it. The &quot;drug
problem&quot; as Edward Brecher reminds us in his classic _Licit
and Illicit Drugs_ is itself a problem. Therefore, it does not
and cannot lead to the formulation of useful solutions. It would
be a real breakthrough if the Congress or the next President
would generate a meaningful statement of the &quot;drug
problem&quot;. </p>

<p>Otherwise, we are condemned to confirm the truth of Eric
Sevareid's quip that the chief cause of problems is solutions. </p>

<p>II. STATE YOUR GOALS </p>

<p>A creative definition or redefinition of the drug problem
would of itself carry us toward a (re)statement of goals.
Rational policy-making is impossible without a clear articulation
of the goals sought to be achieved. Part of that impossibility
arises from the inconsistency between, for example, pursuit of
existing goal number one by an attack on the drug supply and
pursuit of goal number five, the suppression of drug money. </p>

<p>Pursuit of the first creates a crime tariff which makes the
pursuit of the last more or less impossible. Instead, the result
of drug enforcement is a black market estimated by the government
to be over $100 billion per year, money that funds or gives rise
to homicidal violence, street corruption by addicts, corruption
of public officials and international narco-terrorism. It is
therefore essential to distinguish between problems arising from
drugs and problems arising from drug money. For example, how much
criminality is attributable not to the psychopharmacology of
drugs but to the excessive prices intentionally caused by the
prohibition of drugs? Rational policy-makers have to distinguish
between the two and acknowledge the trade-offs between the two
lines of attack. <br>
</p>

<p>III. SET REALISTIC AND PRINCIPLED PRIORITIES BASED ON TRUTH </p>

<p>The suppression of drugs as an end to itself is frequently
justified by arguments that drugs cause addiction, injury, and
even death in the short or long run. Granted that all drug use
has the potential for harm, it is clear beyond any rational
argument that most drug use does not cause such harm. DEA
Director John Lawn to the contrary (&quot;Drugs are illegal
because they are bad&quot;), drugs are not harmful _per se_.
Exposure to drugs is not the same as exposure to radioactive
waste.(70) </p>

<p>Rather, the overwhelming majority of incidents of drug use are
without lasting personal or social consequence, just as the
overwhelming majority of drinking causes no harm to the drinker
or to society. Accepting the truth of that premise means that not
all drug use need be addressed by the criminal law, and that
society might actually benefit from a policy of benign neglect
respecting some forms of drug use. I have in mind the Dutch
model, where nothing is legal but some things are simply ignored,
cannabis in particular. NORML estimates that there are
approximately one half-million arrests per year for marijuana,
almost all for simple possession or petty sale offenses.
Depending upon the age of consent chosen, most of these arrests
could be eliminated from the criminal justice system, thereby
achieving a massive freeing of resources for the policing of real
crime. </p>

<p>Because we live in a world of limited resources, it is not
possible to do everything. It is therefore both logical and
necessary to make distinctions among things that are more or less
important. I have in mind at least five basic dichotomies: </p>

<p>1. drug use by children (top priority) versus drug use by
adults (low priority); </p>

<p>2. marijuana smoking (low priority) versus use of harder drugs
(higher priority); </p>

<p>3. public use of drugs (high priority) versus private use of
drugs at home (low priority); </p>

<p>4. drug consumption (no priority) versus drug impairment (high
priority); </p>

<p>5. occasional use (low priority) versus chronic or dependent
use (higher priority). </p>

<p>From these general criteria for drug policy, I would commend
to the National Commission five specific goals for an effective,
principled drug policy: </p>

<p>1._Protect the Children_. I think this priority is
self-evident and needs no discussion. I would simply add that
this is the only domain in which &quot;zero tolerance&quot; makes
any sense at all and might even be feasible if enforcement
resources were concentrated on this as a top priority. </p>

<p>2._Get Tough on the Legal Drugs_. It is common knowledge that
alcohol (100,000 annual deaths) and tobacco (360,000 annual
deaths) far exceed the illegal drugs as sources of death,
disease, and dysfunction in the U.S. Everyone knows that alcohol
and tobacco are big business -- the advertising budget alone for
alcohol runs about $2 billion a year -- and, what is worse, the
states and federal government are in complicity with the sellers
of these deadly drugs by virtue of the billions in tax revenues
that they reap. </p>

<p>I am not, however, suggesting prohibition of these drugs. That
is wrong in principle and impossible in practice, as experience
teaches. Nonetheless, there are more restrictive measure that can
and should be undertaken. One is to get rid of cigarette vending
machines so that cigarettes are not so readily available to
minors. A second is to require or recommend to the states and
localities more restrictive hours of sale. A third is to levy
taxes on these products that are consistent with their social
costs -- billions of dollars in property damage, disease, and
lost productivity.(71) Those costs should be financed largely by
the sale of these products; at present prices, society is clearly
subsidizing those products by providing police, fire, ambulance
services for road accidents; medicare and medicaid reimbursement
for therapy, surgery, prosthesis or other medical care; and many
other hidden costs effectively externalized by the industries
from smoker and drinker to society as a whole. </p>

<p>Precise numbers need to be derived from studies, but I
wouldn't be surprised to find cigarettes at, say, $10 a pack and
hard liquor at, say, $30-$50 a bottle to be priced more
consistently with their true social costs. Such taxes would have
the additional salutary effect of reducing the consumption of
these dangerous products to the extent that their demand is
elastic. </p>

<p>3. _Public Safety and Order_. Here we need policies directed
toward protection of the public from accident and injury on the
highway, in the workplace and from unruly disruptions in public
streets, public transport, parks and other gathering places.
Programs specifically tailored to accomplish this more focused
goal make a lot more sense than futile and counter productive
&quot;zero tolerance&quot; approaches. Street-level law
enforcement practices need to be reviewed to see to what extent
they may actually encourage hustling drugs in the street to avoid
arrests and forfeitures that might follow from fixed points of
sale. Promotion of driving and workplace safety require more
knowledge. Nothing should be assumed. Drug use, as the Air
Force's and Freud's examples show, does not automatically mean
that a pilot or driver is impaired. Even with marijuana there is
ambiguous evidence as to its effect on motor co-ordination.(72)
Responsible research is required. </p>

<p>4. _Protect Public Health_. The emphasis here is on the word
&quot;public&quot;. Policy should be directed toward 1. treatment
of addicts on a voluntary basis and 2. true epidemiological
concerns such as the use of drugs by pregnant women and the
potential for transmission of AIDS by I.V. drug users. Addiction
treatment is now shamefully underfunded, with months-long waiting
lists in many cities. Purely individualized risks are not in
principle a public health matter and are in any case trivial in
magnitude compared to those now accepted from alcohol and
tobacco. Judge Young found no known lethal dose of marijuana.
Even with cocaine, which has lethal potential, less than 2,000
deaths per year result even though billions of lines or puffs of
cocaine are consumed every year. (Other long-term harms may
result but are not systematically known at this time.) </p>

<p>In any event, harmfulness is not the sole touchstone of
regulation; the requirements of goal number five, listed below,
demand considerable deference to individual choice in this
domain. </p>

<p>5. _Respect the Value of Individual Liberty and
Responsibility_. The current administration's goal of a drug-free
America, except for children, is both ridiculous -- as absurd as
a liquor-free America -- and wrong in principle. This is not
fundamentalist Ayatollah Land after all. A democratic society
must respect the decisions made by its adult citizens, even those
perceived to be foolish or risky. After all, is it different in
principle to protect the right of gun ownership, which produces
some ten to twelve thousand homicides per year and thousands more
non-fatal injuries? Is it different in principle to protect the
right of motorcyclists, skydivers or mountain climbers to risk
their lives? Is it different to permit children to ride bicycles
which &quot;cause&quot; tens of thousands of crippling injuries
and deaths per year? To say that something is
&quot;dangerous&quot; does not automatically supply a reason to
outlaw it. Indeed, the general presumption in our society is that
competent adults, with access to necessary information, are
entitled to take risks of this kind as part of the right to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. </p>

<p>Why are drugs different? It would be truly totalitarian if the
government could decide these matters. After all, if the
government is conceded to have the power to prohibit what is
dangerous, does it not then have the power to compel what is
safe? More specifically, if one drug can be prohibited on the
ground that it is dangerous to the individual, would it then not
be permissible for the government to degree that beneficial doses
of some other drug must be taken at specified intervals.The
freedom of American citizens has already been seriously eroded by
the War on Drugs.(73) More civil liberties hang in the balance of
the 1988 Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act pending in Congress and
further legislation in years to come. Is the defense of Americans
from drugs to be analogized to the defense of the Vietnamese from
Communism, that it was necessary to destroy the city of Hue in
order to save it? The National Commission should give serious
weight to this value in its policy recommendation. <br>
</p>

<p>IV. FOCUS ON THE BIG PICTURE </p>

<p>Present drug policy suffers from a kind of micro-think that
borders on irresponsibility and is sometimes downright silly.
This typically manifests itself in proud administration
announcements or reports to congressional committees of a new
initiative or new accomplishment without regard to its impact on
the bottom line. The examples are endless -- a joint strike force
with the government of the Bahamas; shutdown of a source of
supply; the Pizza Connection case, the largest organized crime
heroin trafficking case ever made by the federal government; a
new bank secrecy agreement with the Caymans; a new coca
eradication program in Bolivia or Peru, and so on. But none of
these programs or &quot;accomplishments&quot; has ever made any
noticeable or lasting impact on the drug supply. Even now, as the
Godfather of Bolivian cocaine resides in a Bolivian prison, is
there any observable reduction in the supply of cocaine? </p>

<p>The lack of insistence that enforcement programs should make a
difference in the real world produces fatuous reports like this
1979 report by GAO to the Congress: &quot;Gains made in
Controlling Illegal Drugs, Yet The Drug Trade
Flourishes.&quot;(74) </p>

<p>In what sense is it meaningful to say that gains are made if
the bottom line grows worse and worse? This is reprehensible
doubletalk or Newspeak that should not be tolerated by
responsible public officials. The whole drug enforcement
enterprise needs to be put on a more businesslike basis, looking
to the bottom line and not to isolated &quot;achievements&quot;
of the war on drugs. In fact, the investor analogy is a good one
to use: if the war on drugs were incorporated as a business
enterprise, with its profits to be determined by its success in
controlling drug abuse and drug trafficking, who would invest in
it? Even if its operating budget were to be doubled to $6 billion
per year, or doubled again to $12 billion per year, would it be a
good personal investment? If not, why is it a good social
investment? </p>

<p>This kind of hard-headed thinking is exactly what is lacking
and has been lacking throughout the War on Drugs. No attention
has been paid to considerations of cause and effect, or to
trade-offs, or to cost-benefit analysis. New anti-drug
initiatives are not subjected to critical questioning: what
marginal gains, if any, can be projected from new programs or an
additional commitment of resources? Conversely, how might things
worsen? For example, many law enforcement officials believe that
the coast guard's &quot;successful&quot; interdiction of
marijuana coming from Jamaica and Colombia in the early 1980s had
two negative side-effects: the substitution of domestic
cultivation of more potent marijuana in California (and
throughout the U.S.) and the diversion of smugglers into more
compact and more readily concealable cocaine. Was that
interdiction initiative therefore truly successful? Weren't those
side-effects reasonably foreseeable? There are other examples. </p>

<p>Drug gangs are probably far more ruthlessly violent today than
in the 1970s because they have learned to adapt to aggressive
law-enforcement methods. The friendly governments of Colombia,
Peru, Bolivia are far weaker today, far more corrupt, and far
more subject to narco-terrorist subversion because of similar
adaptations there by the drug cartel and its associates. Has our
national security been thus advanced by the War on Drugs? </p>

<p>For these reasons, it is important to abjure meaningless,
isolated &quot;victories&quot; in the war on drugs and to focus
on whether a program or policy offers some meaningful overall
impact on the safety, security and well-being of the American
people. In this respect, does it really matter that the DEA has
doubled the number of drug arrests from 6,000 to 12,000 during
the 1980s? </p>

<p>Or that the Customs Service has dramatically increased its
drug seizures to over 100,000 pounds of cocaine? Or that kingpins
like Carlos Lehder Rivas have been convicted and imprisoned for
life plus 135 years? Might it not be that the resources devoted
to those anti-drug initiatives were not merely wasted but
actually counterproductive? </p>

<p>Similarly, it is critical to pay scrupulous attention to cause
and effect. Throughout the war on drugs, administration officials
have been making absurd claims about the effects of anti-drug
policies. Recently President Reagan asserted that the War on
Drugs is working. His evidence? Marijuana smoking is down to 18
million per year and experimentation with cocaine by high school
seniors in the University of Michigan survey declined by 20
percent. Everyone trained in logic knows that this is the fallacy
of _post hoc ergo propter hoc_. But one need not be trained in
logic to realize that there is no provable correlation between
law enforcement initiatives and levels of drug consumption.
Indeed, the same University of Michigan survey shows that
marijuana consumption peaked in 1979, three years before the War
on Drugs even began. Cocaine is purer, cheaper, and more
available than ever before. If use is down, it is not because of
successful law enforcement. Most categories of drug use are down
and will most likely continue to go down as people become more
educated and more concerned about health and fitness, fueled in
some immeasurable degree by media reports of celebrity overdose
deaths such as those of David Kennedy, John Belushi, Len Bias,
and Don Rogers.(75) </p>

<p>Another important factor is the aging of the baby boom
generation. That demographic bulge leaves fewer young people
behind and thus contributes to the aging of the population as a
whole. An older population is simply one that is less likely to
use cocaine, marijuana, and heroin.To attribute these changes to
law enforcement levels is at the least unprofessional. The
liberalization of marijuana laws in California, Oregon, Maine,
and elsewhere in the early 1970s produced no observable rise in
consumption (either new users or increased frequency) of
marijuana compared to other states.(76) </p>

<p>The connection between law and individual behavior at this
level is remote. Government policies are no more responsible for
the current decline in drug use than they were for the boom in
the 1970s and early 1980s. Drug use will almost certainly decline
in the 1990s, no matter what law enforcement does, for roughly
the same reasons that cigarette smoking has declined dramatically
without any change in the law. </p>

<p>V. SUBSTITUTE STUDY FOR SPECULATION </p>

<p>The War on Drugs has produced a siege mentality. Senators from
large states speak of invasions and national security threats.
Even professionals who should know better succumb to anti-drug
hysteria. A former director of the National Institute of Drug
Abuse claimed that without the War on Drugs to restrain the
people, we would have 60-100,000,000 users of cocaine in this
country.(77) Now this is extremely unlikely; because of the
stimulant nature of the drug, it appeals mostly to younger
people, the population is aging, there is already a downward
trend in cocaine except for crack, and so forth. But rather than
trading assertion and counter-assertion, the real question is
epistemological: How does the Director know what he 'knows'? </p>

<p>Clearly, there is no empirical basis for his claim. It must
therefore be an expression of fear or perhaps political maneuver,
but clearly something other than a statement of fact. Why would
the Director of the public agency most responsible for informing
the public on drugs take that tack? Whatever his reasons, wild
speculation is not the path to informed judgment and intelligent,
workable policy. Why not truly confront the question of what less
restricted availability of cocaine would mean in terms of
increased drug use, taking account of both prevalence and
incidence.(78) </p>

<p>There are a number of ways in which this might be done if we
truly want to know the answers. One way is market research. A
standard technique of market research is to conduct surveys and
ask people about what they desire in a product in terms of price,
quality, and other features. How much w ill they buy at various
prices? The same techniques are adaptable, _mutatis mutandis_, to
illegal drugs. </p>

<p>What about the effects of the drug? Is it addictive?
Longitudinal studies of the kind pioneered by Ronald Siegel of
UCLA should be encouraged.(79) NIDA Household Surveys register
only gross numbers and do not track users. (They do not even
cover group quarters, such as college dormitories and military
barracks, where drug use may be higher than average.) At the
present time we have almost no real-world knowledge of the
experience of past and present cocaine users, except those
unrepresentative few who come forward as former or recovering
addicts. Even NIDA has conceded that we lack any estimate of the
relative proportions of addictive use versus experimental or
other non-consequential use in the total population of cocaine
users.(80) Isn't that critical information in regulating the
drug? </p>

<p>(Drug users should be systematically interviewed, but they
will be loath to step forward in the current climate of
repression.) </p>

<p>Useful experiments might also be performed using volunteers
from the prison population (for instance, those serving life
sentences without parole) and perhaps volunteers from the
military services. How would men behave and how would their
health fare with abundant access to cocaine? Would it be used
widely or intensively or both? Finally, comparative studies from
countries such as Holland can tell us a great deal about the
effects of more freely available cannabis and heroin, although
not so with respect to cocaine. We have a lot to learn from the
Dutch.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>CONCLUSION </p>

<p>I endorse a substantial measure of relaxation of drug laws in
some respects simultaneously with a substantial measure of
intensification in other respects: the enforcement of laws to
protect children, along with more stringent laws regarding the
sale of liquor and tobacco. As to the first point, some measure
of relaxation of drug laws is both correct in principle and
pragmatically necessary in the real world of limited resources.
But this is not a 'surrender' in the War on Drugs. There is a
paradox here: that the use of less force may actually result in
producing more control over the drug situation in this country. </p>

<p>Consider the analogy of a panic stop in an automobile. In a
typical scenario, a driver observes a sudden obstruction in his
path and slams on the brakes in order to avoid a collision. If he
uses too much force on the pedal, the sudden forward weight
transfer will very likely induce front-wheel lockup. At that
point, the car starts skidding out of control. If the driver
turns the wheel left or right, the car will simply keep on
skidding forward toward the very obstacle that he is trying to
avoid. In this moment of panic, the 'logical' or instinctive
thing to do is to stomp the brake pedal even harder. But that is
absolutely wrong. The correct thing to do to stop the skid is to
modulate the brake pedal, releasing it just enough to permit the
front wheels to begin rolling again so that steering control is
restored. </p>

<p>Thus, the correct and safe response is counterintuitive, while
the instinctive response sends the driver skidding toward
disaster. I leave it to the Committee to decide whether this has
any relevance in the re-making of drug policy.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>(70) Truth-based legislation will also have to acknowledge
that 'recreational' drugs also have beneficial uses, most notably
medicinal ones. Respectable authorities in the U.S. and abroad
endorse heroin for pain relief for terminally ill patients.
Francis Young, the chief administrative law judge of the DEA,
recommended this summer that marijuana be re-classified to permit
doctors to prescribe it for relief of nausea from chemotherapy
and for other purposes. His opinion concludes that marijuana is
&quot;far safer than many foods we commonly consume.&quot; and
that its medical benefits are &quot;clear beyond any
question&quot;. Judge Young had previously recommended that MDMA
(&quot;ecstasy&quot;) be removed from Schedule I and be made
legally available to psychiatrists for use in treating their
patients.Medical uses are not the only beneficial effects of
drugs. An AP wire from Frankfurt reported that the U.S. Air Force
allows its pilots to take Dexedrine &quot;so that they are able
to fly when they haven't gotten enough sleep or don't feel fit
enough.&quot; Hundreds of thousands of 'drug abusers' similarly
stimulate themselves with amphetamines and cocaine. Over a
century ago, Sigmund Freud discovered in self-experiments that
moderate doses (one tenth of a gram) of cocaine improved his
muscular strength and reaction time. See Blyck, _Cocaine Papers:
Sigmund Freud_ (New York: New American Library, 1974), pp. 98,
103. <br>

<p>(71) The Research Triangle Institute estimated the annual
costs of alcohol abuse to society at $116 billion in 1983.
Conference Board, 'Corporate Strategies for Controlling Substance
Abuse' 13 (Axel, ed., 1986). With 1,000 daily deaths from lung
cancer and other diseases often preceded by years of medical
treatment, there must be billions more in social costs
attributable to tobacco. </p>

<p>(75) About the only category of drug use that appears to be up
is crack, and even that may be confined in large part to urban
ghettos. See the _New York Times_, July 10th, 1988. The overall
decline, of course, is a positive development so long as it is
not offset by a corresponding rise in other drug use, such as
alcohol or tobacco, or suicide or other forms of
health-endangering behavior. In this regard, the National
Commission should fund research directed toward the development
of some meaningful index of health and well-being by somehow
combining total morbidity/mortality date from all major causes.
It would be a true Big Picture accomplishment if we could somehow
confirm that specified demographic segments were not only using
drugs less but were also happier and healthier. </p>

York Times_, September 14th, 1984. </p>

<p>(78) To speak of a rise or fall in drug use is simplistic. It
is important to distinguish between prevalence (the number of
users) and incidence (the frequency of use). In measurable health
consequences, it may be meaningless if the number of people who
try cocaine goes up or down; conversely a change in the amounts
and frequency of consumption may significantly alter morbidity
and mortality. </p>

<p>(79) In a 1984 paper for NIDA (Research Monograph 50), Siegel
concluded that the &quot;hypothesis that long-term use of cocaine
is inevitably associated with an escalating dependency marked by
more frequent patterns of use is not supported by the
findings.&quot; Instead he found that &quot;social recreational
drug users maintained relatively stable patterns of use&quot; in
the face of ready supplies and increased income as they aged. </p>

<p>Sources of Information </p>

<h2>The Consumer's Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs </h2>

<p> The Consumer's Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs is
perhaps the best-written overall view of the drug issue. It was
published in 1972 and some of the information is a little dated
but it still gives a very good picture of how we got into the
present situation. It also contains a lot of information on the
medical problems associated with illegal drugs including a
chapter on famous drug addicts. It also contains a very good list
of references which can be used as a starting point for further
research. It can be found in most good local libraries. </p>

<h2>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse </h2>

<p> The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse, published in 1973, is the largest study ever conducted by
the Federal Government on the drug issue. It is remarkable
because it was formed by President Nixon who hand-picked every
member of the commission because they agreed with his views on
drugs. Furthermore, the commission refused to even hear testimony
from advocates of legalization or decriminalization. Despite
this, they concluded that our current policy was doomed to
failure and some form of decriminalization was the only
acceptable approach. It is contained in several large volumes and
can be found in the better libraries, such as university research
libraries. </p>

<h2>Clearinghouse and Data Center for Drugs and Crime </h2>

<p> Current information on drugs and crime can be obtained
through the Clearinghouse and Data Center for Drugs and Crime
data at 1-800-666-3332. This is a Federal facility which provides
information free to anyone who wants it, including a long list of
books on drugs and crime statistics. The primary bible of crime
statistics for the Federal Government is the Sourcebook of
Criminal Justice Statistics, published every year. This book
contains several hundred pages of crime statistics including
state by state breakdowns, racial breakdowns, charts, graphs, and
other information. The book is available through the
Clearinghouse above, or through any branch of the Government
Printing Office. The cost is either free or about $20.00,
depending upon how you can get it. </p>

<p> The Clearinghouse also operates a free research service which
will look up the answers to specific questions or help you
compile information on a particular issue. They are generally
very helpful and will lead you to a lot of other good sources of
information. </p>

<h2>The Bureau of Justice Statistics </h2>

<p> The Bureau of Justice Statistics maintains an electronic
bulletin board which gives online access to a lot of the Federal
crime statistics. The BBS number is 301-738-8895 (8-N-1) 300 to

<h2><a name="DDE_LINK1">National Institute on Drug Abuse</a> </h2>

<p> Rockville, MD 20857 </p>

<p> NIDA clearinghouse </p>

<p> 800-729-6686 </p>

<p> The National Institute on Drug Abuse publishes a series of
research monographs every year summarizing the research on drugs
in the previous year. There is a wide variety of information
published every year, including everything from short summaries
of research projects to full-blown analyses of different aspects
of the drug problem. Included in these monographs are the current
statistics for drug deaths and other drug-related health problems
(also available through the Clearinghouse above). Interesting
items include a 1979 publication called &quot;Themes in Drug
Prohibition&quot; which details the rationale and propaganda
which has been used through the years to promote the drug war.
Let it suffice to say that the information is not flattering to
the drug warriors by any means. Another interesting piece is the
1988 study on drugs and violence which concluded that
drug-related violence increased directly as drug law enforcement
increased. The information is contained in several volumes which
often take up five shelves or more in a typical small library.
Many libraries, particularly better libraries, will contain
fairly sizeable collections of the NIDA information. </p>
